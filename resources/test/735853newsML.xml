<p>Egypt's Ministry of Health has decreed that imported grains and pulses meant for human consumption must be accompanied by a certificate which proves that genetic engineering was not used in their production.</p>
<p>A copy of the decree, dated July 1, was sent to local traders this week and obtained by Reuters on Thursday. It says: "It is not approved to import foodstuffs which have used genetic engineering in their production, until they are proven fit for consumption."</p>
<p>"Imported grains and pulses must be accompanied by a certificate from the country of origin saying that they have not been harvested or produced using genetic engineering."</p>
<p>Officials at the ministry of health could not be immediately reached for comment on Thursday, a national holiday.</p>
<p>The decree said Egyptian ports of entry would be notified of the rules, which it said must be published in local newspapers.</p>
<p>The implementation date was not immediately clear.</p>
