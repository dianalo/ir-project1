<headline>U.S. bank groups battle over thrift charter change.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-06-13</dateline>

<p>Bank and thrift groups on Friday pleaded their cases to the House Banking Committee over proposals to update the thrift charter in the current banking bill.</p>
<p>Banks want to change thrift guidelines to make them play by they same rules as banks do, in exchange for agreeing to allow a merger of the bank insurance fund (BIF) and the savings and loan insurance fund (SAIF).</p>
<p>"The American Bankers Association ... would adamantly oppose any bill that fails to address the thrift charter issues," the ABA said in a letter to the committee.  </p>
<p>"Removing thrift charter issues from the financial modernization bill would leave thrifts with a significant competitive advantage over banks," the letter continued.</p>
<p>But a thrift group, America's Community Bankers, shot back that unless Congress carried out proposals to let banks and thrifts expand into new business sectors, thrifts should retain their current less-onerous charter.</p>
<p>"Because it appears that the committee will not consider legislation that expands competitive opportunities for banks, thrifts and their customers, we urge you to leave the thrift charter in place as a business option," the group wrote.</p>
<p>The ACB argued that thrifts provide better service to consumers and therefore should be afforded more flexibility than bigger banks and that BIF-SAIF merger should be considered on its own merits.</p>
<p>The Banking Committee will hold a markup -- or formal consideration -- of its financial modernization legislation next Tuesday.</p>
