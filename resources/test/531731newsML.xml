<p>A Jesuit priest among hostages freed by Peruvian commandos from the Japanese ambassador's residence said on Wednesday he was amazed to be alive after the four-month ordeal under the gun of Marxist rebels.</p>
<p>Juan Julio Wicht said he had no idea how all but one of the 72 hostages escaped with their lives from Tuesday's assault by 140 elite troops.</p>
<p>"This attack was horrible. What you see on television or at the cinema is nothing like the real thing, I don't understand how we came out alive," Wicht told Reuters.</p>
<p>But the priest, who declined to leave the besieged Japanese mansion in December when the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels freed 225 captives, said that violence was not the answer.</p>
<p>"This armed attack was practically inevitable but it is not the answer. Peace doesn't come through bullets, we must learn this," Wicht said.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult aspects of their long captivity was a lack of sleep in the mouse-infested ambassador's residence.</p>
<p>"The mice were all over us. This was so nauseous and disgusting that the number of rodents did not let us sleep," Wicht said.</p>
<p>The physical conditions, with little light, almost no water and cramped space on two floors, became gradually more stressful for the hostages during their 126 days of captivity.</p>
<p>"We're very lucky to have been able to keep our mental state in order, but the lack of sleep was very difficult," he said.</p>
<p>The priest, who other hostages said was a constant source of strength throughout their ordeal, felt completely helpless during the attack.</p>
<p>"I understood that people were dying but I could not do anything about it," he said.</p>
<p>All 14 rebels were killed in the attack. One of the hostages, a local judge, and two commandos also died.</p>
<p>Wicht, playing chess at the time of the assault, described it as a frightening experience.</p>
<p>"It was terrible, there were explosions everywhere, we threw ourselves on the floor, I couldn't see more than two metres in front of me because of all the smoke, then minutes later commandos came into where I was to tell me first to stay calm and then to follow him," he said.</p>
<p>The whole building shook from the explosions, chunks of ceiling fell onto the hostages and bullets flew above their heads as they were led to safety, he added.</p>
