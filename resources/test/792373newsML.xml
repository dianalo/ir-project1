<p>(Corrects headline from 1996 year low)</p>
<p>Singapore's key Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) fell past the year's low (corrects from 1996 low) to 1,912.74 points at the start of the Monday afternoon session, spurred by fund selling, dealers said.  </p>
<p>The year's low of 1,913.55 points was easily breached due to a combination of bearish factors.</p>
<p>"The performance on Wall Street combined with general weak sentiment regionally caused funds to get out," a dealer with a foreign brokerage said.</p>
<p>He cited across the board liquidation in index-linked stocks as well as banks, food and beverage and electronics.</p>
<p>Dealers said they would look to a test of 1,900 points soon, after which some support should be forthcoming around 1,880.</p>
