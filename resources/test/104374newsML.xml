<p>Romania's lower house of parliament on Wednesday approved a draft law allowing the central bank (BNR) to give credits to two troubled private banks to help them redeem small depositors.</p>
<p>A parliament spokesman said the bill had received the required number of votes in the Chamber of Deputies but had no details. Earlier this month, it cleared the upper house, the Senate, and will become effective after presidential approval.</p>
<p>In July, the BNR halted support to Dacia Felix SA and Renasterea Creditului Romanesc Credit Bank SA saying they had stopped payments for more than one month. The move came after a year of continuous state support to the two medium-sized commercial banks to keep them afloat.</p>
<p>In the seven years since the collapse of communism in Romania, not a single bank has been declared bankrupt.</p>
<p>Transylvanian-based Dacia Felix came under scrutiny last November with reports of bad loans of $200 million and a 1995 loss of 642.2 billion lei. Credit Bank went through a management crisis after its president was arrested on fraud charges in January 1995.</p>
<p>The central bank provided documentary evidence on Dacia and Credit Bank with courts, which are expected to rule on their liquidation or reorganisation.</p>
<p>Under the bill, the central bank will give around 300 billion lei in credits to Dacia Felix and Credit Bank to cover payments for individuals' deposits up to a limit equivalent to 10 million lei.</p>
<p>Two months ago, the government approved a compulsory insurance deposit system for small depositors in banks. But the scheme does not apply retrospectively to cover Dacia and Credit Bank investors. ($=3,262 lei) -- Mirela Eremia, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264</p>
