<p>The rouble was steady on Friday due to Central Bank selling during the week but dealers said rouble demand remained high on demand from bank clients and investors in government securities.</p>
<p>With today roubles again trading outside the Central Bank rates, the Central Bank continued to buy dollars.</p>
<p> roubles/dollar	Jun 13 midday  Jun 13 early   Jun 11 close</p>
<p> today settlement    5,758-59	 5,763-65	 5,759-60</p>
<p> tomorrow settlement 5,763-64	 5,765-66	 5,763-65</p>
<p> overnight credit (%)   10-15	     8-12	    25-30</p>
<p>			   Jun 13				Jun 11</p>
<p> central bank	  5,761/5,803			 5,760/5,802</p>
<p> MICEX		   5,764				 5,762</p>
<p>"The market is full of dollars and it is attractive to open rouble positions. Big client sales of dollars are keeping the rouble high," ICFI Bank dealer Gleb Sorokin said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the central bank was buying dollars for today settlement at 5,759-60 per dollar. They were unable to estimate the volume of intervention.</p>
<p>They added the rouble could find more support as Finance Ministry will offer 20 trillion roubles -- the largest sum ever sold in one day's auctions -- of GKO discount Treasury bills and OFZ interest-bearing bonds at auctions on June 18.</p>
<p>T-bill market dealers said earlier yields on long-term GKO discount Treasury bills fell to record lows on Friday after the Central Bank announced a cut in its refinancing rate from June 16 to 24 percent from 36 percent.</p>
