<p>The Kurdish stronghold of Sulaimaniya is quiet and so far there is no evidence of an Iraqi advance to capture the city, a senior U.N. official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>"Nothing right now is happening in the city. It is still under PUK control," the official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said.</p>
<p>He said U.N. staff and guards have not detected any troops approaching the city. "There was some shelling in the morning but still we have not determined its source," he said.</p>
<p>Sulaimaniya is the last remaining major Iraqi city held by Kurdish rebel leader Jalal Talabani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).</p>
<p>Iraqi troops, backed by heavy armour and artillery and forces of Kurdish rebel leader Massoud Barzani of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), captured Arbil on Saturday.</p>
<p>The U.N. official said Iraqi troops, reinforced in the past few weeks, were holding positions outside Jemjal, a sizeable Kurdish town almost half way between Kirkuk and Sulaimaniya.</p>
<p>Sulaimaniya is 109 km (68 miles) east of Kirkuk.</p>
<p>The Iraqi News Agency (INA), quoting travellers arriving in Kirkuk from Sulaimaniya, said on Sunday the city had not been shelled since the start of military operations in and around Arbil.</p>
<p>Talabani, in a French radio interview, denied an earlier report by a U.N. source in Baghdad that Iraqi forces had shelled Sulaimaniya.</p>
<p>"Areas some 15 kms from the city were under heavy shelling but not the city itself...The road to Sulaimaniya is mountainous and the city and the area are liberated and under the strong hold of PUK forces," he said.</p>
<p>"I am expecting that (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein and Massoud Barzani will try to attack but it will be very difficult for them. It is not like Arbil which was surrounded by Iraqi forces," Talabani said.</p>
<p>Unlike Arbil, Sulaimaniya is outside the air-exclusion zone Western allies imposed on northern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Iraqi Kurds against military attacks by Baghdad.</p>
