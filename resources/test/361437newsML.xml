<p>CalEnergy, Duke Power and Southern Co are pondering bids for all or some of 18 power plants owned by New England Electric System, the Wall Street Journal said Thursday.</p>
<p>The paper said people involved in the process believe the plants could fetch bids higher than the $1.1 billion at which they are valued on New England Electric's balance sheet.</p>
<p>New England Electric expects about 35 companies to tour the power-generating plants, which are in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont, the paper said.</p>
<p>National Fuel Gas Co, U.S. Generating Co, which is partly owned by PG&amp;E, and a unit of Edison International have also looked at the plants, the report said.</p>
