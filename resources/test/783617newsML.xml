<title>MALAYSIA: KL interbank rates steady as market remains tight.</title>
<headline>KL interbank rates steady as market remains tight.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-08-06</dateline>

<p>Interbank rates were steady on Wednesday morning as the market remained short of funds, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said absence of central Bank Negara Malaysia in the market also kept rates firm.</p>
<p>"There was no sign of central bank lending this morning. Rates are holding firm as the market remains tight," said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>One-month money was at 8.1/2 percent against 8.0 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Three-month money was unchanged at 8.0/1 percent, while one-week was flat at 8.0 percent.</p>
<p>Bank Negara was seen lending one-month money at 8.0 percent through an agent bank on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The central bank has been injecting funds over the past two weeks to help ease market tightness, caused by its massive intervention in the foreign exchange market to defend the ringgit against speculative attack.</p>
<p>The overnight rate was expected to continue trading around 8.0 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said rates may come off slightly on Friday when there will be a maturity of Bank Negara bills worth one billion ringgit.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were slightly lower to reflect steady interbank rates.</p>
<p>At 0330 GMT, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was down one point to 92.40, or an implied yield of 7.60 percent.</p>
<p>The December contract was also down one to 92.63, or 7.37 percent.</p>
