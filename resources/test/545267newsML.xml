<p>Daiwa Securities Co Ltd has been awarded the mandate by South Africa to lead-manage the country's latest planned samurai bond, an official at Daiwa said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Business Day newspaper in Johannesburg said earlier this month that South Africa had decided on a yen issue in June to kick off its four billion rand foreign borrowing programme.</p>
<p>South Africa last issued samurai bonds in 1995 and the amount was about 30 billion yen. At that time, Daiwa also acted as a lead-manager, underwriters said.</p>
<p>Underwriters here said they were unsure about the volume of the samurai because South Africa was also planning to issue U.S. dollar-denominated bonds at around the same time.</p>
