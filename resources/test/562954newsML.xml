<p>Trade on the Istanbul gold exchange remained quiet on Tuesday, with volume down to 610 kilos from Monday's 635 kilos and with traders largely sidelined as prices rose on the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gold closed firmer at $343.60 an ounce and 1,511,000 lira per gram, compared to $341.30 and 1,506,000 lira on Monday following higher prices on European markets.</p>
<p>"There wasn't much demand from the free (gold) market, but there was some activity due to players taking positions which made up the bulk of the volume," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The Turkish lira eased to 136,550 lira to the dollar, against 136,300 lira on Monday, pushing up gold's lira price.</p>
<p>Most of the day's trade -- 430 kilos -- took place in the morning session, with 88.5 percent of the total traded in lira terms.</p>
