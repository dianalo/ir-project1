<p>The number of phone calls made in Shanghai totalled nearly 8 billion in 1996, 16 percent more than in the previous year, the Liberation Daily reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the number of calls was growing on the back of a huge increase in the number of installed telephones. At the end of 1996 Shanghai had 2.59 million telephone subscribers compared with 370,000 in 1990.</p>
<p>The paper said the rate of successful connections during peak hours in 1996 rose 8.7 percentage points to 65 percent from the 1995 rate.</p>
