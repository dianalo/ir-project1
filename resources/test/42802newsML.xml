<p>British entrepreneur Richard Branson said on Tuesday he was not aiming to lodge a formal complaint against Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) which he said was flouting European competition rules.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, SAS rejected accusations by Branson's Virgin Express regional airline that SAS was unfairly cutting the cost of tickets between Brussels and Copenhagen, but only for flights coinciding with the cheap Virgin flights.</p>
<p>Branson said he was writing a letter to the European Commission "at this moment" pointing out the selective SAS fare cuts.  </p>
<p>"(But) rather than going through a formal complaint situation I hope they would just drop a line to SAS," he told a news conference here to promote the launch of Virgin Express's Brussels-Copenhagen link.</p>
<p>"We hope it will be settled in a sensible way," he added.</p>
<p>"What (SAS) should accept is that in most businesses there are more than just two players...but four, five, six, seven competing. There is plenty of room for people to fly on SAS flights, to fly on Virgin flights," he said.</p>
<p>But Branson warned SAS not to "play dirty" by undercutting prices on the Brussels-Copenhagen route.</p>
