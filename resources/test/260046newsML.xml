<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe says a woman who yelled abuse at him in the street inspired him to secretly write a book, going on sale on Tuesday, to explain his unpopular policies to sceptical French citizens.</p>
<p>Pleading for understanding in his 116-page "Entre Nous" (Between You and Me) book, Juppe reveals a streak of joking self-deprecation that belies his image as a brilliant but cold technocrat.</p>
<p>Going on sale just in time for Christmas presents for fans of the least popular prime minister in modern French history, Juppe's expresses twin feelings of enthusiasm and suffering in his job. The book is from NiL publishers.</p>
<p>Juppe, 51, reaffirms he aims to stay on until legislative elections in 1998, while hinting at a possible reshuffle to strengthen his centre-right cabinet. The book was released to the media on Monday.</p>
<p>He also defends policies aimed at helping France qualify for a single European currency from 1999, saying that there are no alternatives to the budget austerity that opposition parties say have aggravated record 12.6 percent unemployment.</p>
<p>Explaining why he wrote the book, Juppe said he was strolling one day in the streets of his southwestern city of Bordeaux when he spotted a couple walking towards him.</p>
<p>"Fashionable-looking. Pretty woman. They look friendly. At the moment they pass, the woman starts leaping like a goat kid. She shouts: 'Death to the bloody idiot!'"</p>
<p>"I was her target, there's no doubt. Pretty passer-by, I wanted to reply to you," Juppe wrote in his book, whose plain white cover patriotically uses red and blue lettering -- the colours of the French flag.</p>
<p>Beyond the woman, he said he hoped to be better understood by French people in hostile opinion polls, reporters who look "wide-eyed with incredulity" when he vows to stay on until 1998 and critics from his own centre-right coalition.</p>
<p>"The French people grumble about change and since I'm trying to force this change, they find it a relief to blame me for their ills," Juppe writes, echoing complaints by President Jacques Chirac last week that France is too conservative.</p>
<p>Juppe found time to write the book between his jobs as prime minister, mayor of Bordeaux and head of the ruling Rally for the Republic (RPR) party, founded in 1976 by Chirac.</p>
<p>He discusses the issue of retiring as prime minister.</p>
<p>"In any case I'm not clinging on. I won't be satisfied being a premier by default. It's not in my rather blustering nature, I admit it," he said. "The president or the majority in parliament can decide my fate at any moment. It's one of the charms of the job when you like suspense."</p>
<p>Discussing the possibility of a cabinet reshuffle, Juppe says: "When it comes to reinforcing the government, I know at least the criteria that will guide the president's actions: courage for reforms, closeness with the French people."</p>
<p>Chirac himself wrote a book during his 1995 presidential campaign with an apple tree on the cover symbolising his hopes for a flourishing France. That book was a vote-winner, diagnosing a widening social gulf in France.</p>
<p>Many accuse Chirac and Juppe of betraying calls for a war on jobs to iron out social inequalities and of hiking taxes when they focused on cutting them. Juppe said people's memories of the campaign were "rather selective".</p>
