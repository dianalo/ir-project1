<p>Va'aiga Tuigamala has finally been granted a work permit to ensure he can make a rugby union comeback with London club Wasps.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old Samoan, currently still playing league with Wigan in 1993, had originally been refused a permit on the grounds he had not played international rugby union in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>His last match for the All Blacks was in 1993, but legal pressure has persuaded the government and the Rugby Football Union (RFU) to change their stance.</p>
<p>"Inga Tuigamala has demonstrated he has been a truly outstanding rugby union player and is currently at international standard in rugby league," said an RFU spokesman.</p>
