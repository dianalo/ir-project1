<p>U.S. foreign crudes faced some moderate demand at the Gulf Coast helped by a narrow Atlantic arbitrage and relatively high refinery output.</p>
<p>Regional sellers were seen more aggressive than those with European or West African cargoes, suggesting economics for trans-Atlantic sales were confined to large players.</p>
<p>A U.S. trader who purchased a September 8-10 Brent fob on Monday was seen reselling that cargo at similar levels today, at September Brent minus 25 cents.</p>
<p>"It's a tight profit margin, and there are enough domestic supplies around," a Houston trader said.</p>
<p>Regional grade differentials were buoyant with Colombia's Ecopetrol heard selling two cargoes of Cusiana recently.</p>
<p>One end September cargo was reportedly traded at Oct WTI minus 12 cents fob, up from recent trade at minus 27 cents.</p>
<p>Oriente was on offer for mid-September loading at WTI minus $1.75 cif, also a shade stronger.</p>
<p>Rumors of another Alaska North Slope cargo being deiverted to the U.S. Gulf from the saturated West Coast surfaced, but this was flatly denied by the alleged seller.</p>
<p>Traders remained uncertain how depressed sour prices could beco,Tme upon the sale of Iraqi crude oil.</p>
<p>In other regional talk, heavy, sweet Argentine Mendanitos was shown into the U.S. at 50 cents premium to WTI for mid Oct arrival.</p>
<p>Aftermarket hours saw Oct Brent partials changing hands at $20 and $19.97, 100 lots apiece.</p>
<p>Brent Sep/Oct intermonth spreads traded at 40 and 45 cents, traders said.</p>
