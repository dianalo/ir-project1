<p>ING Barings in London rated Polish firm Farm Food SA as "accumulate" saying it was the most efficient meat processor in Poland, likely to increase its earnings, ING said in a report dated January 27.</p>
<p>ING said Farm Food's consolidated earning-per-share ratio should increase by 24 percent and 62 percent in 1997 and 1998 respectively, up from last year's 3.1 zlotys per share.</p>
<p>"The start-up of the recently modernised plant at Jaroslaw will have a strongly positive influence on group earnings, a fact that we believe has not been fully reflected in recent share price performance," it said.</p>
<p>The stock is valued at 12.2 times and only 7.5 times 1997 and 1998 earnings, respectively, and only 5.4 times and 3.7 times consolidated 1997 and 1998 cash flow, it said.</p>
<p>ING Barings expected Farm Food to raise its net profit to 12.6 million zlotys in 1997 and to 21.5 million in 1998, up from last year's net of 9.2 million zlotys.</p>
<p>It said the company's sales were likely to grow to 478.7 million zlotys this year and to 597.8 zlotys in 1998, up from 345.6 million zlotys in 1996.</p>
<p>Farm Food closed at 51 zlotys on Tuesday.</p>
