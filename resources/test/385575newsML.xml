<p>Turkey's interior ministry has ordered provincial governors to watch for potential trouble at nightly street protests against a security scandal, Anatolian news agency reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Popular support has grown for a campaign launched on February 1 to pressure the government into resolving a scandal linking the state and crime gangs.</p>
<p>Many Turks switch off lights, sound car horns or take to the streets with lighted candles each night at nine p.m. for demonstrations dubbed "One minute's darkness for illumination". Protesters have begun chanting anti-government slogans in recent days.</p>
<p>The campaign has generally been peaceful, but newspapers report that one man died during a protest on Sunday night after he was detained by police in the southern resort of Antalya.</p>
<p>"As it is seems such protests will continue for a time...I request that all necessary security arrangements and measures be taken," Interior Minister Meral Aksener said in a statement faxed to provincial governors.</p>
<p>The statement called for police patrols to watch for gatherings of "provocateurs".</p>
<p>Security officials in the eastern province of Tunceli, where Kurdish rebels are active, said security forces would prevent the demonstrations as of Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The protests were inspired by the uncovering of a scandal last November after a leading policeman and a wanted gangster died in a traffic accident in the same car. A government MP was also injured in the crash.</p>
<p>The media has carried an increasing number of claims about state-underworld ties, but investigations of the links have so far yielded limited results despite the questioning of officials and suspension of leading police officers.</p>
<p>A senior police official suspended over an alleged police role in the killing of Turkey's leading casino entrepreneur Omer Lutfu Topal has been allowed to resume his duties, Anatolian said.</p>
<p>It quoted interior ministry sources as saying that deputy Istanbul police chief Bilgi Unal returned to his post on Monday.</p>
