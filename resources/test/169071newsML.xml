<p>A production contract for Britain's Bowman army radio project is unlikely to be signed before early 1999, about 15 months after the originally envisaged date, defence procurement minister James Arbuthnot said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Racal Electronics Plc heads the Yeoman consortium which is a leading bidder for the contract, which could be worth some two billion stg to the winner, as well as providing major opportunities for exports.</p>
<p>Arbuthnot said in a parliamentary written answer that the project definition phase was now essentially complete and development standard equipment was undergoing field trials.</p>
<p>"Arrangements for proceeding to the production phase are under consideration and a decision on the way ahead will be taken as soon as possible," he said.</p>
<p>"The estimated date of contract signature for production will depend upon the outcome of our considerations but it is unlikely to be before early 1999."</p>
<p>"This would represent a slippage of about 15 months compared with the date envisaged at the beginning of the project definition phase," he added. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7767</p>
