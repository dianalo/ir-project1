<headline>US stock index futures lower after Thurs decline.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-01-24</dateline>

<p>Most U.S. stock index futures opened narrowly mixed and quickly dipped lower, hampered by worries after sharp losses Thursday.</p>
<p>U.S. March Standard and Poor's 500 futures posted a dramatic bearish reversal on Thursday, collapsing to a one-week low after hitting a new record high just below 800.00. Some technicians said that action points to more losses for March S&amp;Ps, with downside targets as low as 740.00.</p>
<p>"I think we're going to be weak again today," an S&amp;P 500 futures trader said. "I don't think what happened yesterday was good for the market at all," he said.  </p>
<p>Technicians called the reversal a significant sign that the market had become overbought and needed to correct. March S&amp;Ps, after all, had posted five consecutive sessions of record high prices, they said.</p>
<p>"All week we continued to put in new highs on light volume," an S&amp;P 500 trader noted. He said the light volume and pockets of illiquidity in record territory were signs that the market was due to step back.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was nervous today, eyeing weak Treasury bond futures. Some said the market could consolidate until Tuesday's employment cost index data.  </p>
<p>It should be noted that while the New York Stock Exchange posted record volume on Thursday's collapse, S&amp;P 500 futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange registered about half of its volume record with 84,640 contracts traded. S&amp;Ps traded a record 162,022 on October 19, 1987.</p>
<p>Even though futures' decline did not have the volume behind it that stocks did, technicians called the reversal powerful and put downside targets at 775.00, 765.00, 760.00 and 740.00.</p>
<p>Jay Hohmann, futures trader with DLJ in New York, said a move to 740.00 would not impair the long-term bullish uptrend.  </p>
<p>He said Thursday's collapse adjusted the market to a more comfortable level.</p>
<p>At 0925 CST/1525 GMT, March S&amp;Ps were down 0.95 points to 779.30, KBT Value Lines rose 1.50 at 704.00, new composites dropped 0.35 at 409.90, Nikkeis were down 115 at 17,620 and Nasdaq 100s rose 1.00 at 920.50.</p>
