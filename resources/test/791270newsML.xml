<p>Indonesia is considering using water bombers to control forest fires which are causing haze pollution across South East Asia, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>Senior officials from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei held a meeting in Jakarta to discuss the haze problem and said the top priority was to control forest and ground fires.</p>
<p>"In this regard, the meeting noted that in addition to existing control measures, Indonesia has undertaken to investigate the feasibility of using water-bombers for fire suppression and to strengthen enforcement against illegal ground and forest fires," a joint statement issued by the participants said.</p>
<p>Indonesian officials said last week that the haze had disrupted air and sea traffic on the islands of Java, Sumatra and Kalimantan.</p>
<p>Malaysian officials issued health warnings, saying rising pollution in some parts of the country may have been caused by the fires.</p>
<p>"It's not just that we are just exporting smoke to Singapore and Malaysia, but it's also that the social cost to us is high," the meeting's chairman, Indonesian Assistant Environment Minister Surna Djajadiningrat, told reporters.</p>
<p>He said strong action would be taken against those convicted of illegal forest fires. Indonesian law currently provides for imprisonment of up to 10 years and a fine of up to 100 million rupiah ($38,460) for offenders.</p>
<p>Officials said fires were often started by entrepreneurs clearing forests to set up plantations and that current dry conditions had exacerbated the problem. ($1 = 2,600 rupiah)</p>
