<p>A moderate earthquake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale shook Costa Rica on Wednesday during a visit by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, but there were no reports of casualties or damage, officials said.</p>
<p>The quake struck at 11.16 a.m. (1716 GMT) and was centred 10 miles (16 km) south of the port of Quepos, which is 90 miles (140 km) south of the capital San Jose, the Costa Rican Volcanic and Seismologicial Observatory said.</p>
<p>The quake was felt for about seven seconds in most of the country but preliminary reports said no one was hurt, it added.</p>
<p>The quake took place a few minutes before the end of a welcoming ceremony at Juan Santamaria airport for Hashimoto, who was starting a three-hour visit as part of a Latin American tour.</p>
<p>Hashimoto, who arrived at 11 a.m. (1700 GMT), showed no sign of having felt the quake, witnesses said.</p>
