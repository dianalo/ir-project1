<p>Shares were dented on Thursday by sharp losses among paper and high tech stocks on Wall Street overnight and the Dow's modest correction at the open on Thursday gave little help, brokers said.</p>
<p>The HEX general index fell 0.76 percent to 2,775.46 points and volume was a modest 508 million with only 23 percent in bourse engine Nokia which fell 4.50 to close at 321.00 markka.</p>
<p>U.S. interest rates were left on hold on Wednesday but wary eyes turned to the U.S. January employment report due on Friday, which some feared could be strong and may increase the chances of a rate hike next month.</p>
<p>Finland's largest bank Merita, and insurers Sampo and Pohjola reacted mildly to news of unsuccessful merger talks, which brokers said did little to dim expectations of another restructuring in financials.</p>
<p>Merita closed relatively lively trade unchanged at 16.80. Pohjola fell 3.50 to 143.50 and Sampo rose 4.00 to 424.00.</p>
<p>Finnlines bucked the trend on hopes for a strong full-year 1996 report on Friday, closing at 130.00 markka -- its highest since June 1994. Finnlines' 1996 profit was seen rising to 408 million markka from 319 million in 1995.</p>
<p>Lift maker Kone also rose ahead of its full-year report due on Friday, up 5.00 to 560.00.</p>
<p>Brokers list newcomer food group HK Ruokatalo had a strong first showing, surging 20 percent to 120.00 markka. Trade was hefty, as cooperative LSO cut its stake to 63.0 percent from 83.7 percent in a single 49.6 million markka trade at the open.</p>
