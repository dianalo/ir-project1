<p>Widepsread rain was forecast for the U.S. central Plains and Midwest for the balance of the week, which should delay winter wheat planting in the Plains and corn harvest in the Midwest, meteorologists said.</p>
<p>Rain and cold should also extend south across northern Texas, which may be detrimental to the sorghum and cotton.</p>
<p>"There is a tremendous rainfall event coming up for the corn belt," said Craig Solberg, meteorologist with Freese-Notis Weather, who forecasts widespread amounts of 1/2 to two inches through Friday with three to four inches likely in localized areas.  </p>
<p>Similar rain amounts were forecast from now into the weekend from Nebraska to Texas. Across north Texas, the rain followed by low temperatures from the upper 30s (degrees Fahrenheit) to low 40s may be harmful to cotton.</p>
<p>"The cotton area down around Lubbock also will be turning colder...which is not very favorable," said Joel Burgio, Weather Services Corp meteorologist.</p>
<p>Low temperatures in the mid 30s were forecast for the western Midwest Friday and Saturday. The weather could produce scattered frost, but meteorologists doubt there will be widespread frost damage to corn and soybeans then.  </p>
<p>Cloudy skies with this week's rain system should prevent temperatures from dipping into low 30s across the Midwest, they said.</p>
<p>Another cold system is likely next week.</p>
<p>Weather Services' Burgio said a cold air mass should form in Canada early next week that could move south into the United States.</p>
<p>Burgio said it is too early to forecast low temperatures but that the cold system bears watching.</p>
