<p>Wal-Mart Stores Inc said Monday they have endorsed a new payment card security mechanism called the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol and have started to implement it on a trial basis for its Wal-Mart Online store.</p>
<p>This technology, jointly developed and endorsed by the major payment card companies, will allow consumers to purchase merchandise on the Internet using encryption technology and a "digital certificate" mechanism that enhances existing online security.  </p>
<p>The digital certificate provides confidentiality, ensures payment integrity and authenticates merchant identity. It also keeps files in an electronic wallet that is protected by the consumer's selected password, Wal-Mart said.</p>
<p>"We know our customers want to conduct transactions in a highly secure manner and that is why we have taken a leadership position in being the first merchant to offer the SET payment option," said David Glass, president and chief executive for Wal-Mart Stores.</p>
<p>Companies participating in the new payment card security technology include American Express Co, Chase Manhattan Bank, First Data Corp,  Globeset, GTE Corp, International Business Machines Corp and  MasterCard International.</p>
