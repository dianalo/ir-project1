<p>Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama told a news conference on Wednesday that a supplementary budget will be adopted for the current fiscal year to next March 31, but the size of the budget and other details are still undecided.  </p>
<p>"It is all right for you to think that we are planning to adopt a supplementary budget. We have things to do for the reconstruction of areas hit by the Kobe earthquake, and others," Kajiyama said.</p>
<p>He was asked to comment on remarks by officials of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party calling for an extra budget worth about five trillion yen and featuring economic stimulus steps.</p>
<p>"It is something LDP officials have said, so we have to be responsible for that. But nothing is certain yet as to the size of the budget and how we will estimate the necessary funds," he said.</p>
