<p>Japan's Finance Ministry (MOF) wants a body to inspect banks' financial health that is semi-independent but not totally outside the ministry's jurisdiction, a ministry source said.</p>
<p>Such a body must be headed by the finance minister as the person in charge of international cooperation with finance ministers abroad in the event of a global financial crisis, he said.</p>
<p>To maintain a system that can handle bank failures swiftly, closer relations between inspection and supervision were needed, he added.</p>
<p>The source also said the ministry was ready to give positive consideration to merging its banking and securities bureaux.  </p>
<p>Japan's Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said earlier this month that the government would aim to have its bills on Finance Ministry reforms pass through parliament at the next regular session which begins in January.</p>
<p>The former ruling coalition -- the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the Social Democrats and the Sakigake Party -- unveiled a plan in September to reform the Finance Ministry, including provision for the creation of an independent body to assume the supervisory and regulatory powers through which the ministry has exercised control over the financial industry.</p>
<p>The LDP has formed a minority government under Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto but has also made a loose alliance with its former coalition partners. The three parties have agreed to devolve the supervisory functions of the Finance Ministry to an independent body.</p>
