<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures firmed on Friday morning in line with a rise in Tokyo stocks and dealers said the lead contract looked capable of further gains.</p>
<p>By the lunchtime break, the Nikkei 225 June contract was up 285 points at 18,350 after hitting an early high of 18,390.</p>
<p>A slight overnight fall on Wall Street was ignored by most dealers who prefered to focus on strong demand for financial stocks and blue chips in Japan and some signs Japan's economy may be stronger than expected.  </p>
<p>Comments on Friday by the director-general of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau, Eisuke Sakakibara, to Reuters that the possibility of the Japanese economy contracting was less than people thought, was cited by one dealer as a positive factor.</p>
<p>Dealers said the June Nikkei futures contract had the potential for further rises if it closed above 18,300 on Friday.</p>
<p>"It could go higher," said one Singaporean dealer. "I think the chances are good that it will close above 18,300. Then the next resistance will be psychological at around 18,500."  </p>
<p>He said the behaviour of the U.S. stock market on Friday would be the key to Monday's direction.</p>
<p>"Unless the U.S. plunges we should be OK," he said.</p>
<p>Dealers saw support for the June contract at 18,000 points.</p>
