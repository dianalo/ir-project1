<p>Two Philippine mills bought 100,000 tonnes of Canadian wheat at around $185 per tonne, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>The commodity will be shipped between May and July this year, one trader said.  </p>
<p>"The Philippine order for Canadian western red spring wheat was clinched recently at $10 per tonne cheaper than U.S. prices for the same wheat quality," said another trader.</p>
<p>Philippine mills are shiftinbg back to Canadian wheat suppliers due to prevailing high prices in the United States, traders said.</p>
<p>"It seems Philippine buyers are now confident to buy again Canadian wheat after they were assured of prompt delivery," an executive in a Philippine flour mill told Reuters.</p>
<p>Canadian wheat suppliers had to give "discounts" to Philippine wheat buyers in the past two months due to delayed deliveries.</p>
<p>Port congestion in Canada due to heavy snow early this year delayed shipments of wheat orders for March and April deliveries, traders said.</p>
<p>Philippine buyers of Canadian wheat said they were assured by Canadian suppliers that the congestion in Canadian ports had eased due to better weather conditions.</p>
