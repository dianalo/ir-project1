<p>--  </p>
<p>Bombay shares plunged 3.7 percent on Friday as stunned speculators cut long positions after keenly anticipated new market policy initiatives failed to come through, traders said.</p>
<p>"The Prime Minister kept saying he was going to make policy announcements...and then he vanished," said a trader at a foreign brokerage.</p>
<p>"It's hurt his credibility badly. Speculators were forced to unwind their positions on the last day," the trader said.</p>
<p>Friday is the last day of the weekly account on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).  </p>
<p>"Those that bought hoping that the market would shoot up further after the announcements were stunned and had to sell their positions," said a trader at another foreign brokerage.</p>
<p>He said foreign funds adopted a wait-and-see policy. Local funds sold in early trade and positions later in the session.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda on Monday reiterated his promise to unveil a market package before he departed for the World Economic Forum summit in Switzerland on Friday.</p>
<p>But traders' hopes were crushed late on Thursday after Finance Minister P. Chidambaram told newsmen the package was comprised of a series of measures announced earlier in January.  </p>
<p>"Everyone was stunned," said the chief dealer of a foreign brokerage. "It was like a blow on the head."</p>
<p>"Even the measures announced by the market regulator were not really market-moving," he said.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Thursday said foreign investors would be allowed to invest in government debt. It cleared a proposal on securities lending and approved a new takeover code for companies.</p>
