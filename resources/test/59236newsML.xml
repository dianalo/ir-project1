<p>Envoys from Kuwait, the strongest regional supporter of Washington's attacks on Iraq, toured Arab capitals on Tuesday to justify the continuing U.S. military buildup in the Gulf.</p>
<p>Information Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Saud al-Sabah said after talks in Cairo with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that Kuwait still felt threatened by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>"We don't deal with words but with realities which we see clearly in Iraq's south and these are worrying," Sheikh Saud told reporters before leaving for talks in Syria.</p>
<p>Syria and Egypt were two key Arab members of the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraq from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War but neither has endorsed the latest U.S. confrontation with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Kuwaiti Defence Minister Sheikh Ahmad Hamoud al-Jaber al-Sabah left to tour some of the other five members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah flew to London on Monday night from Paris for consultations with British officials.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent lack of support for Washington, Western analysts in Kuwait said a fresh attack on Iraq would not destroy the 1991 coalition if targets were limited to air defences in no-fly zones.</p>
<p>One analyst said Washington's standoff with Iraq was now at "a lull or a pause" but the issue was still "unresolved...unsettled".</p>
<p>The confrontation was triggered by Baghdad's intervention in northern Iraq, where Saddam's forces had been excluded for five years. The U.S. responded with missile attacks on southern Iraq and an expansion of the southern no-fly zone -- an area of Iraq closed to Saddam's aircraft but patrolled by the West.</p>
<p>When Iraq responded by firing at U.S. air patrols, Washington ordered a military buildup in preparation for further attacks. Although Iraq suspended its threat to shoot at U.S. aircraft, Washington has continued to concentrate forces, including two aircraft carriers and cruise-missile carrying submarines.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton declined to rule out fresh attacks and his top military adviser, General John Shalikashvili, said: "We are not standing down."</p>
<p>A Western analyst said more attacks on Iraqi air defences would not break up the old coalition despite widespread opposition.</p>
<p>However, diplomatic sources said it was important for the United States and Kuwait, invaded in 1990 by Iraq, to explain to allies why they feel such action might be necessary.</p>
<p>Western sources in Kuwait believe Saddam has not done enough to satisfy Washington, with the United States now focusing on Iraqi air defences in the expanded no-fly zone in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry has warned Iraq to stop deploying anti-aircraft missiles in the area and some military sources believe Washington wants Saddam to disable those already in place.</p>
<p>A senior Gulf Arab military official said Gulf states that oppose hitting targets inside the no-fly zone "would reluctantly stay silent" if U.S. attacks were limited.</p>
<p>But, said the non-Kuwaiti officer: "A wider attack will ruin everthing and could split the coalition."</p>
