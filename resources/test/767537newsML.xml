<p>South Korea's troubled Kia Group said on Wednesday it planned to reduce the number of its domestic affiliates to five from the current 28 through sell-offs, mergers and spin-offs.  </p>
<p>"As the first goal of management reform efforts, we plan to drastically cut the number of affiliates and concentrate on the automobile industry," the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>The statement said it planned to sell off or spin off 16 affiliates and have another seven absorbed by five others.</p>
<p>The five firms that will remain under the umbrella of the Kia Group are Kia Motors Corp, Kia Motor Sales Co, Kia Precision Works Co, Kia Electronics and System Co and Kia Information Systems Co, it said.  </p>
<p>Asia Motors Corp will sell off part of its assets and be absorbed by Kia Motors Corp to become one of Kia's assembly plants, it said.</p>
<p>Kia Motor Sales would absorb three other affiliates engaged in vehicle sales and foreign trading business and Kia Precision Works would absorb Kia Heavy Industries.</p>
<p>It said it would also sell any assets that could generate cash but were not directly related to the vehicle industry.</p>
<p>Kia also plans to reduce its workforce to a total of 51,502 by the end of this year from 60,337 at present, and further to 44,000 until the restructuring plan is concluded.  </p>
<p>Kia's creditor banks have selected 18 of the group's units for bail-out after determining Kia would be unable to avoid defaulting on its debt payments.</p>
<p>Creditor banks were meeting on Wednesday to review the group's self-rescue plans and discuss offering additional financial support.</p>
