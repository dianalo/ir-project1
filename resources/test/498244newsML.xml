<p>Shareholders in Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd on Wednesday approved the possible float of the company's marine operations.</p>
<p>The extraodinary general meeting also approved a change in the company's name to Residual Assco Group Ltd, allowing the marine division to be called Adsteam Marine if it is floated.  </p>
<p>Adsteam chairman Peter Cottrell said after the vote that an overwhelming number of proxies had supported the proposals.</p>
<p>No date was set for the float of the marine division, but further details could be released at a news conference set for 11.30 a.m. (0200 GMT) on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Adsteam said on March 2 that the float could occur before June with the right market conditions but would not comment on media reports that the company would raise up to A$160 million from the sale.</p>
<p>Funds raised would be used to reduce debt.  </p>
<p>The maritime unit consisted of an extensive harbour towage and marine services operation in more than 33 Australian ports and another four ports in Papua New Guinea and Fiji.</p>
<p>Adsteam said the unit was Australia's largest marine towage operator with a fleet of 45 vessels, including some owned in joint ventures with Howard Smith Ltd and the Stannard family. The unit's 1995/96 pre-tax operating profit rose by A$4 million to A$19.6 million.</p>
<p>Adsteam was one of Australia's largest corporate failures following the debt binge of the 1980s.  </p>
<p>It came under the control of its bank creditors in 1990 with debts of A$11 billion which has now been reduced to less than A$700 million. Woolworths Ltd and David Jones Ltd were once part of the Adsteam group and were floated by the creditors.</p>
