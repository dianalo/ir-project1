<p>IPE Brent crude and gas oil futures traded sideways on Tuesday with neither market finding the impetus to make a break out of a tight trading range, brokers said.</p>
<p>By 1200 GMT September Brent stood nine cents up at $18.50 a barrel around the middle of a seven cent range. August gas oil was unchanged at $167 a tonne holding a $1 trading range.</p>
<p>Brokers were mostly looking to NYMEX gasoline for direction but sentiment for this was seen turning bearish.</p>
<p>GNI Research said in their daily report gasoline's rise through 65 cents on Monday was constructive.</p>
<p>But they added the August contract was becoming increasingly vulnerable from a technical perspective and there may be increases in volatility.</p>
<p>Tom James at Credit Lyonais Rouse in Singapore said, "NYMEX gasoline is looking ready for an extended technical correction to lower numbers, the RSI's are very overbought".</p>
<p>He recommended placing sell-stops below 63.70 cents on the prompt contract and a reduction in overall length.</p>
<p>IPE gas oil remained well above trendline support on the daily spot month continuation chart stemming from July 15s low of $160 through $162-$163.25, coming in today at around $165.75.</p>
<p>Prices made good headway either side of the weekend peaking at $167.75 on Friday on the back of stronger crude and briefly breaking resistance at $168 a double top from July 3 and July 17 on Monday, but analysts said the market needs to break this level more convincingly to go any higher.</p>
