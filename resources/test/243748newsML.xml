<p>Horace Mann Educators Corp. said Monday it plans to withdraw from the group medical insurance business over the next two years, resulting in the loss of about 40 jobs.</p>
<p>The Springfield, Ill.-based company said it will focus on its core group life and disability insurance lines.</p>
<p>Horace Mann said it will account for group medical as a discontinued operation and expects to incur a $3 million charge in the fourth quarter for severance and other expenses and for operating losses during the phase-out period.</p>
<p>It estimated an after-tax net operating loss of $5 million in fiscal 1996 from its group medical insurance line.</p>
<p>The company said it intends to stop writing new group medical insurance policies in January and stop renewing group medical insurance policies in January 1998.</p>
<p>Horace Mann said its group medical business for 1995 generated 6.8 percent of the company's total premiums written and contract deposits.</p>
<p>The company's stock rose 62.5 cents to $38.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
