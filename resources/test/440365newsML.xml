<p>Washington state and Prudential Insurance Co of America have agreed to an amended state settlement that requires the company to pay a $700,000 state fine and spend up to $600,000 to help protect consumers, state officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"This amended settlement addresses some of the issues raised in recent debate about the settlement, and it makes sure that Washington consumers receive the benefits of the programs they deserve," state Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn said in a statement.</p>
<p>The amendments were signed by Senn and Prudential representatives earlier this week. The amended consent order still contains consumer protections for Prudential policyholders to oversee the settlement during the claims process, Senn said.</p>
<p>In addition to the $700,000 state fine and the $600,000 commitment, Prudential has agreed to repay policyholders in the state who were allegedly misled between 1982 and 1995, state officials said.</p>
