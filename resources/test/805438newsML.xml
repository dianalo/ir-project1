<p>Latin American stocks were likely to stay guarded this week after last Friday's tumble on Wall Street, with investors trained on overseas reaction to Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, brokers said.</p>
<p>Brazilian shares, which plunged 4.78 percent Friday as U.S. stocks plummeted, were expected to continue to take their cues from overseas due to a lack of local news.</p>
<p>"The bolsa will look to Wall Street for direction as nothing much is happening locally," said a trader at Citibank's local brokerage unit.</p>
<p>Sao Paulo's Bovespa index of 47 leading shares tumbled to end Friday at 11,335 points, off 1.8 percent on the week.</p>
<p>In Mexico, stocks were expected to start the week hesitantly, but a strong report on second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could give the market a boost.</p>
<p>"I reckon that, after the recent adjustment, it's a good time to take part. It's a good opportunity to buy into economic growth," said Gerardo Copca, deputy director of analysis at valores Finamex brokerage.</p>
<p>After strong June industrial output, analysts moved up second-quarter GDP forecasts to around six percent late last week, suggesting vibrant growth in the period.</p>
<p>Stocks also would take their cue from Tuesday's meetings of the FOMC and Germany's Bundesbank, which experts said was likely to keep Mexican stocks in check.</p>
<p>Argentine stocks also were expected to maintain their guarded tone this week, which is shortened to four days due to a national hoiliday Monday.</p>
<p>"Things look pretty risky out there, even though the bolsa fared well Friday when Wall Street plummeted," said Miguel Daneri at Boston Securities.</p>
<p>Although the Dow reeled Friday, the blue-chip Merval index edged down only a slight 0.2 percent to close at 838.71.</p>
<p>Shares in Santiago, where the bolsa was closed Friday when the Dow dropped three percent, were expected to take direction from the New York Stock Exchange, where dozens of large Chilean firms are listed.</p>
<p>"The local market will be eyeing Wall Street. We expect the market to fluctuate without a clear trend and in low turnover this week," said a senior analyst at a Chilean bank.</p>
<p>Local stocks were likely to drop if the U.S. market continues its slide or if the FOMC decides to raise interest rates, he added.</p>
<p>Santiago's IPSA index eased 1.38 percent last week to close Thursday at 132.23.</p>
<p>After a week of oscillating prices, Caracas shares were seen continuing to track broadly sideways in thin trade, with locals awaiting the return of large foreign investors distracted by Friday's Wall Street drop.</p>
<p>Local brokers, meanwhile, have honed in on less fashionable stocks, including paint firm Corimon and bottler Envases Venezolanas.</p>
<p>The market's 19-share index drifted 0.9 percent lower to end the week at 9.257.78, but remains up 40 percent in dollar terms for the year.</p>
