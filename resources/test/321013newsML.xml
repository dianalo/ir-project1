<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG) on Tuesday started market-making in UK stocks, marking another stage in the evolution of the investment bank's equity business in London.</p>
<p>Despite the troubles of Morgan Grenfell's fund management business, shaken by the suspension of top fund manager Nicola Horlick, its securities business continues to progress towards its goal of offering an integrated pan-European equity service.</p>
<p>Head of UK equities John Smith told Reuters he had been pleasantly surprised by the level of business which the house had transacted on its first day of quoting prices in UK shares.  </p>
<p>"Across the board we have conducted a significant share of business and in certain stocks we have seen a very substantial share of business," Smith said.</p>
<p>He said DMG's eight UK equity market-makers had been quoting buy-and-sell prices in all 100 stocks in the blue chip FTSE 100 index and in some 60 others.</p>
<p>"This is a huge landmark in the development of our UK equity activities," Smith said. "We have always seen it as very important to offer a whole equity service and it is nice to add another part of the jigsaw."</p>
