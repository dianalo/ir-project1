<headline>Jury selection begins in RJR tobacco case.</headline>
<dateline>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. 1997-04-07</dateline>

<p>Jury selection began Monday in Connor vs R.J. Reynolds, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp, the latest case brought against the tobacco industry by attorney Norwood "Woody" Wilner.</p>
<p>The trial is Wilner's first tobacco trial since last August, when he won a landmark $750,000 verdict, dealing cigarette makers their worst courtroom loss in 40 years.</p>
<p>The Brown &amp; Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries Plc has appealed that award, which was made to a life-long smoker with lung cancer.  </p>
<p>In the current trial, Wilner said he would charge that Reynolds, America's second-largest cigarette maker, deceived the public with misleading ads.</p>
<p>Reynolds' attorneys have contended that the late Jean Connor, who died of cancer in 1995 at age 49 and whose family brought the case, had made an informed decision to smoke.</p>
<p>Reynolds also faces possible punitive damages in Florida.</p>
<p>Connor's sister, Dana Raulerson, the plaintiff on behalf of Connor's estate and her three children, was in court for the beginning of the closely watched case Monday.  </p>
<p>The pool of 53 potential jurors was given a list of 50 questions, among them inquiries about whether they had ever told anyone to stop smoking, had strong feelings about cigarette companies, thought the government should ban the sale of cigarettes or had a friend or family member die of lung cancer.</p>
<p>The process was intended to choose six jurors and three alternates in a case that Judge Bernard Nachman said was likely to last two to three weeks.</p>
<p>A few of the jurors said the expected length of the trial would be a problem for them, but none had been dismissed by early afternoon.</p>
<p>Jury selection was expected to take several days and opening statements were expected to begin later this week.</p>
