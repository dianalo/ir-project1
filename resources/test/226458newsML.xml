<p>The European Commission has started a probe into a proposal by Textron Inc of the United States to acquire the whole of Kautex Werke Reinold Hagen AG, the German supplier of blow-molded plastic fuel tanks and its operations in Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>It said in a notice published in the European Union's Official Journal that the deal was submitted for clearance under the bloc's merger rules on November 15. The Commission has one month from that date to clear the operation or start a full probe.</p>
<p>Textron, which is active in aircraft and automotive components as well as fastening systems, defence components and financial services, is also taking control of U.S.-based Kautex North America Inc, the notice said.</p>
<p>Textron acquired Kautex, the world's largest producer of plastic fuel tanks, from German engineering group Klockner-Werke AG.</p>
<p>The Commission must vet all large mergers and acquisitions if the companies involved do important business in the 15-nation Union. -- Brussels newsroom 322 2876841</p>
