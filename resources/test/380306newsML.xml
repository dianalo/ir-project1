<title>HONG KONG: Cheung Kong abandons Hutchison waiver.</title>
<headline>Cheung Kong abandons Hutchison waiver.</headline>

<p>Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd said on Friday it would no longer seek a waiver which would have allowed it to raise its stake in Hutchison Whampoa Ltd to 50.17 percent without triggering a general offer.</p>
<p>In a reorganisation of the Cheung Kong group, Cheung Kong was due to receive 349.50 million new Hutchison Whampoa shares in return for the transfer of its 70.66 percent stake in Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd to Hutchison.</p>
<p>The transaction would have boosted Cheung Kong's Hutchison stake to 50.17 percent from 45.36 percent which, without the waiver from the Securities and Futures Commission, the regulatory body, would have triggered a mandatory offer for Hutchison.  </p>
<p>"The directors of CKH (Cheung Kong) and Hutchison announce that, due to the time required to produce an asset valuation for Hutchison...the waiver could not be obtained within the set timetable," Cheung Kong said in a statement.</p>
<p>Cheung Kong said in January that if the waiver was not obtained, it would receive 254.32 million new Hutchison shares and about HK$5.57 billion in cash for its Cheung Kong Infrastructure stake.</p>
<p>"On this basis, the shareholding of the CKH group in Hutchison upon implementation of the transactions would be 48.95 percent," it said on Friday.  </p>
<p>Cheung Kong and Hutchison said they did not believe it was in the best interests of their shareholders to further delay the despatch of circulars detailing the reorganisation and "have decided...not to proceed with the waiver application".</p>
