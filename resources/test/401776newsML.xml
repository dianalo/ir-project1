<p>The European Union reiterated on Tuesday that talks between Bulgaria and the International Monetary Fund on a macroeconomic stabilisation programme must be well advanced before the EU could go ahead with new macro-economic aid for the country.</p>
<p>"I think it's anyhow necessary that the negotiations with the IMF should be well advanced," the EU's External Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek told a news conference after a meeting between EU foreign ministers and Bulgarian foreign minister Stoyan Stalev. @</p>
<p>A joint statement said the EU was prepared "to take initiatives in order to mobilise support for the international financial institutions and the world community, in parallel with the IMF negotiations and provided a credible economic stabilisation and reform programme is put in place."</p>
<p>"In the same context, the European Union will consider providing Bulgaria with further macro-economic assistance..." it said.</p>
<p>An EU position paper prepared for the meeting said that the Union had already provided two macrofinancial loans of 290 million Ecus and 110 million Ecus respectively to Sofia. @</p>
<p>It said the first of these is due for repayment in two instalments in December 1997 and March 1998.</p>
<p>Bulgaria's President Petar Stoyanov last month drew the world spotlight onto his country's economic crisis when he raised the prospect of Bulgaria defaulting on its external debt unless it received urgent help.</p>
