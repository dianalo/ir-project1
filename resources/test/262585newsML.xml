<title>USA: U.S. housing starts up strongly in November.</title>
<headline>U.S. housing starts up strongly in November.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-12-17</dateline>

<p>Construction starts on new homes and apartments jumped the highest in more than a year during November, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday, as cheaper mortgages spurred building.</p>
<p>Total starts increased 9.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.514 million in November -- far above Wall Street economists' forecasts for 1.39 million. It was the strongest monthly increase since an 11.5 percent surge 16 months earlier in July 1995.  </p>
<p>The surprisingly strong gain in November starts followed back-to-back revised drops of 5.1 percent in October starts to 1.386 million a year and a 4.7 percent drop in September to 1.461 million.</p>
<p>Previously, the department said October starts had fallen 5.1 percent to a rate of 1.366 million a year and that September starts were down 6.1 percent to 1.44 million, but it revised both of those estimates.</p>
<p>The strength in building activity was broad-based, with starts on single-family homes climbing 7.6 percent in November to a rate of 1.164 million a year and apartment starts up steeply by 15.1 percent to 350,000 a year.</p>
<p>There are indications that a moderate bounceback in housing may continue for a few more months.</p>
<p>For example, new applications for building permits picked up in November after three consecutive monthly drops, rising 3.9 percent to 1.415 million.</p>
<p>And on Monday, the National Association of Home Builders reported that its index of market activity rose slightly in December, reversing a downward trend that began in June.</p>
<p>"The recent decline in interest rates has apparently improved builders' perception of the marketplace," said assocation president Randy Smith, a builder in Walnut Creek, Calif.</p>
<p>The housing industry is headed for one of its best building and sales years in many years, as steady employment growth has kept incomes rising and boosted consumer confidence in the economy's future.</p>
<p>In addition, mortgage rates have remained relatively low by historical standards and even declined in November.</p>
<p>The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, said rates for a 30-year loan averaged 7.58 percent in November, down from 7.92 percent in October.</p>
<p>Total housing starts during November were 3.8 percent higher than a year earlier, when new homes were being started at an annual rate of 1.458 million.</p>
<p>The only region in which starts declined last month was the Northeast, where they fell 2.2 percent to 131,000 a year. Starts were unchanged from October in the West at a rate of 364,000 during November.</p>
<p>But in the South -- the biggest regional market -- November starts rose briskly by 12 percent to 337,000 a year. In the Midwest, they gained even more strongly by 20.8 percent to an annual rate of 337,000.</p>
