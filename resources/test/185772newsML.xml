<p>President Nelson Mandela said on Wednesday that South Africa was aiming for a budget deficit of 5.1 percent of gross domestic product this year and 4.0 percent in the next financial year.</p>
<p>"We want to keep the budget deficit at 5.1 percent this year and at four percent next year," Mandela said in a speech to businessmen. He said the government was trying to keep the budget below 200 billion rand.</p>
<p>It would be necessary for the government to keep spending down to achieve that figure.</p>
