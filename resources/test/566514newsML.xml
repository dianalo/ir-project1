<p>US Airways said Wednesday that it furloughed 103 of its 5,000 pilots as part of its routine work assignment process.</p>
<p>Pilots and the company have been negotiating pay and other issues for several months.  USAirways would not elaborate on the reasons for the layoff.</p>
<p>"What's happening with the pilots is a private communication between the company and them," said company spokesman Rick Weintraub.  </p>
<p>He added that the affected pilots were covered under a side-letter agreement that prohibited pilot furloughs, but which expires June 30.  The furloughs are scheduled to begin July 1.</p>
<p>The company has stated in a recent series of employee meetings that it is in search of a competitive cost structure in order to compete with low cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines Co and become the carrier of choice.</p>
<p>But US Airways has also said that if it cannot get a handle on costs it will become a smaller, regional carrier.  </p>
<p>Jim Gardner, a spokesman for US Airways pilots with the Airline Pilots Association, said  the pilots "are committed to working cooperatively with management to find the right solutions that work for USAir, our customers and employees."</p>
<p>He added however, that "Our vision is the growth that will help US Airways become the carrier of choice."</p>
<p>Gardner declined to comment on any prospective actions that the association might take.</p>
<p>But a source close to the union said that ongoing negotiations between the pilots and the union are proceeding amicably, and will continue that way as long as pilots are convinced that US Airways is serious about growing the airline rather than shrinking it.</p>
<p>The company, which has also placed a tentative order for 400 new fuel-efficient airplanes and has considered starting a low-cost airline, said those plans are on hold until the low cost structure is in place.</p>
<p>"You can't ask the banks and Wall Street for $14 billion until they know you can pay for it," said Weintraub.</p>
