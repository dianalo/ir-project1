<headline>Dlr edges lower by U.S. noon as data fails to lift.</headline>

<p>The dollar edged slightly lower in morning trade, receiving little help from a mixed bag of U.S. data and overnight mark weakness, dealers said.</p>
<p>Some traders said the greenback could face a possible sell-off if it fails to best its recent highs versus the mark.</p>
<p>"I think there's a danger that if the dollar can't make a good puncture above the highs, there could be a mini sell-off," said Elliott Dix, assistant vice president of foreign exchange at Signet Bank.  </p>
<p>Dix said that dollar/mark highs have been "few and far between since March...struggling each time to get incremental gains. And I don't think those are the types of gains people are willing to take big risks on."</p>
<p>The dollar hit a 39-month high of 1.7423 on June 6 and has since made brief but short-lived forays above the 1.74 mark level.</p>
<p>The U.S. unit reached a high of 1.7377 in early trade but slipped to 1.7335/45 midday from 1.7356/61 at the open. Against the yen, the dollar fell to 113.25/35 from 113.60/70.  </p>
<p>The greenback seesawed, eventually retreating in early trade after the release of soft U.S. consumer price data enhanced prospects for Federal Reserve policymakers to leave interest rates unchanged at their July 1-2 meeting.</p>
<p>The U.S. Labor Department reported a 0.1 percent rise in consumer prices for May, following a 0.2 percent increase in April. Wall Street had expected a 0.2 percent gain, according to a Reuters poll.</p>
<p>The dollar's response to U.S industrial output and capacity utilization reports was muted, with dollar/mark little changed immediately following the data.  </p>
<p>U.S industrial production rose 0.4 percent in May, following an upwardly revised figure of 0.3 percent the month before. Wall Street economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a rise of 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>Capacity utilization printed 83.7 percent, which was also above market expectations for a 83.4 percent reading.</p>
<p>In Europe, EU officials resolved to ensure a timely launch to European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).  </p>
<p>Earlier, market-rattling comments by French European Affairs Minister Pierre Moscovici cast some doubt over the French commitment, but a  spokesperson for French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin dismissed that view as "not our political will".</p>
<p>Renewed confidence in EMU has the mark under pressure, and some analysts saw hope for the dollar to extend gains against the German unit in this session.</p>
<p>John Nelson, currency trading manager at ABN AMRO said the market "appears to be willing to test the upper end of the trading range, and the recent top."  </p>
<p>Traders said that in Tuesday's tight trade, dollar/mark and dollar/Swiss franc could be the only significant movers.</p>
<p>The dollar posted a session high against the Swiss unit after the Swiss National Bank intervened to keep European safe-haven seekers out of the currency. It had fallen to 1.4462/72 Swiss francs at noon from 1.4475/85 at the open.</p>
<p>Some dollar/yen dealers said they were already short ahead of Japan and U.S. trade releases scheduled for release tonight and Thursday, respectively.</p>
<p>"I don't think dollar/yen is going to move a whole lot ahead of the tankan (survey) unless people position themselves a little bit," said Cynthia Cooley, a foreign exchange analyst and trader at United Gulf Bank of Bahrain.</p>
<p>In other trading, the dollar dipped to Canadian $1.3855/60 from C$1.3860/65. Sterling rose to $1.6382/88 from $1.6380/90.</p>
