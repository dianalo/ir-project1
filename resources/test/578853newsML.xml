<p>Russia will maintain a tough line in talks on a new security agreement with NATO on Tuesday, Itar-Tass news agency quoted President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman as saying.</p>
<p>Spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin had underlined the need for a firm line defending Russia's national interests at a short meeting with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Monday. The minister will meet NATO Secretary General Javier Solana in Moscow on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>"The president 'confirmed the foreign minister's mandate for the talks' and noted the need to continue the firm Russian line, based on defending the country's interests especially on the bloc of military questions," Tass said.</p>
<p>Kremlin sources say Russia has already decided to sign a deal in Paris on May 27, but intends to keep up the uncertainty and anti-NATO rhetoric until the last minute to appease domestic opponents.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has also started what the Kremlin says will be several days of telephone diplomacy by calling several NATO leaders. He made the first call to French President Jacques Chirac and planned other calls on Tuesday, the Kremlin said.</p>
<p>The Moscow-NATO deal is aimed at overcoming Russia's strong objections to the Western defence alliance's plans to expand eastwards to take in new members from the former Soviet bloc.</p>
