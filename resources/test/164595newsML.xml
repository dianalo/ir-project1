<p>Turkey's state Grain Board (TMO) will import an unspecified amount of wheat soon to stabilise domestic wheat prices, which surged after the government held up a U.S. wheat cargo on grounds it might contain fungus, a senior TMO official said on Monday.</p>
<p>He said the government agency would also export up to 250,000 tonnes of feed barley from its surplus this year.  </p>
<p>"There is a consensus among the related ministers of the government to import wheat," he said."We will import the wheat as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Turkish milling wheat prices rose to 27,000 lira per kilo ($277 per tonne) this week from 20,000 lira two weeks ago after the agriculture ministry said it was inspecting a cargo of 15,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat, which is currently the chief supply for Turkish millers.</p>
<p>Officials said the TMO might invite tenders for small cargoes so as not to spark a rise in world prices.</p>
<p>An analyst said the initial amount could be 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes of milling wheat.</p>
<p>The official also said the TMO, which bought about 600,000 tonnes of feed barley from farmers this year and exported 125,000 tonnes of it through a tender in September, would export up to 250,000 tonnes of feed barley towards the end of this month.</p>
<p>He also said the TMO would sell part of its durum wheat purchases of 600,000 tonnes from farmers to local pasta producers after an expected government decree.</p>
<p>The decree would enable the TMO to sell durum locally at world prices, usually 20 percent below domestic prices.</p>
<p>The difference would be offset by the treasury.</p>
