<p>Swedish transportation company ASG AB on Thursday posted an operating loss of 14 million crowns for the first quarter of 1997, blaming a weak domestic market and depressed prices on transportation services.</p>
<p>The figure compares to an operating profit of 23 million crowns in the first quarter of 1996. Sales rose to 3.45 billion crowns in the first quarter of 1997 from 3.03 billion crowns.</p>
<p>ASG, a leading transportation and logistics company in the Nordic region, is involved in air, sea and overland freight.</p>
<p>"Market trends strengthened in the Nordic region in the first quarter, with increased volumes for domestic and international traffic," ASG said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Within the export industry the order intake increased but demand on the Swedish domestic market continued to be weak.</p>
<p>"The total demand for transportation services in the first quarter were relatively good but price competition continued to be keen," ASG said.</p>
<p>In the company division covering air and sea freight, Air &amp; Sea, net turnover rose to 519 million crowns in the first quarter from 331 million crowns. The division posted a flat operating profit of eight million crowns in the first quarter.</p>
<p>"Result development in the Air &amp; Sea division fell somewhat in the first quarter as a result of a weaker result within the air operations and investments in ASG USA," the statement said.</p>
<p>"The increase (in turnover) is mainly because of the acquisition of ASG USA which was consolidated from January 1, 1997. At the end of the period Air &amp; Sea changed partnership agreements in more than 30 countries," it said.</p>
