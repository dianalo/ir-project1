<p>Albania's ruling Democratic Party on Thursday selected President Sali Berisha as their sole candidate for a new five-year term in office.</p>
<p>Democratic Party chairman Tritan Shehu, who is also foreign minister, said the party's executive national council voted almost unanimously to back Berisha's candidacy.</p>
<p>"The national council decided by a majority of votes that our candidate should be President Berisha for a new term," Shehu told reporters.</p>
<p>"He...is the one who has been able to develop democracy and Albania's integration into Euro-Atlantic structures," he said.</p>
<p>Of the 90 members of the Democrat national council present, 85 voted in favour of backing Berisha, with five abstentions.</p>
<p>Albania's parliament, dominated by the Democrats, must elect a president by March 9. With the party holding 122 seats out of 140 in the assembly, Berisha was sure to have no trouble in winning a new term.</p>
<p>Small opposition parties have decided against contesting the election and Berisha was likely to face the vote unopposed.</p>
<p>The main opposition Socialist Party boycotted parliament after alleging the Democrats rigged last year's general election.</p>
<p>Socialist leader Fatos Nano, Berisha's main political rival, is in jail for corruption. International human rights groups have called for his release and the Socialists say he is being held as a political prisoner.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party faced its first serious split last week when 12 deputies and two other senior party members signed an appeal calling for Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi's government to resign over a pyramid investment scheme scandal.</p>
<p>One of the 14 party dissidents, Dashamir Shehi, said the group did not oppose Berisha's candidature but insists that the president should be independent of party politics.</p>
<p>Parliament was due to convene later on Thursday to name a date next week for the presidential election.</p>
