<p>Singapore personal computer maker and telecommunications equipment company IPC Corporation reported a dramatic turnaround on Wednesday, saying it was back in healthy profit after a losing 1996.</p>
<p>It said net profits urged 253.5 percent to Singapore $18.8 million (US$12.9 million) for the six months ended June 30. In 1996, IPC posted a loss of S$23.9 million.</p>
<p>IPC's half year results far exceeded Edinburgh Financial Publishing's Estimate Directory's consensus net profit forecast for the full year of S$15.7 million.  </p>
<p>The strong 1997 first half profits were on a sharply lower turnover of S$270.5 million against S$738.4 million in the same period of 1996.</p>
<p>IPC said in a statement that if turnover for the first half of 1996 had been adjusted to exclude contributions from overseas units disposed of during that year, it would have decreased to S$414.6 million.</p>
<p>Chairman Patrick Ngiam said IPC expected to maintain the same level of profits in the second half of 1997. The strong performance so far this year was due to the restructuring of the company last year, he said.  </p>
<p>"We concentrated our overall business efforts in computer and peripherals in the Asian business arena," he told reporters at a briefing on the first half results.</p>
<p>Computers and peripherals contributed operating profit of about S$10.8 million for the first half.</p>
<p>An investment in German telecommunications equipment company Hagenuk Telecom GmbH had paid off handsomely with S$9.2 million in pretax profit for the period.</p>
<p>Ngiam said plans to take a 70 percent stake in Hagenuk were likely to be put into action by the end of the year. IPC currently has a 37.5 percent stake in Hagenuk.  </p>
<p>He said IPC had a three-part strategy in computers and peripherals.</p>
<p>It sold bare-bone systems to distributors who can then configure the finished products to customers' needs, licenced IPC's designs and brand name and sold complete systems in higher-end models.</p>
<p>Ngiam said this approach, including appointing distributors in smaller, would reduce overheads.</p>
<p>IPC would launch a network computer (NC) in the fourth quarter this year for the corporate market and an NC for the consumer market by the first quarter next year.  </p>
<p>An NC is a low-cost, stripped-down personal computer that depends on networks for operating systems and applications.</p>
<p>IPC would launch a new GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) product and a dual-mode product integrating GSM and DECT (Digital European Cordless Telephony) technologies by the end of the year, Ngiam said.</p>
<p>"The wireless local loop technology on DECT solutions, which is one of the core competent technologies of Hagenuk, is going to be expanded to developing countries such as China," he said.</p>
<p>"We expect good projects for telecoms over the next few months," he added.  </p>
<p>Ngiam said IPC had not shut down its financially-troubled South Korean unit, which was reported to have defaulted on promissory notes.</p>
<p>But he said said IPC had aborted its agreement to sell 66 million shares to South Korea's Sungwoo Group because Sungwoo was unable to obtain the nexcessary foreign exchange approval for the investment.</p>
