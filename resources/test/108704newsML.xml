<p>Inquire, the equity research division of Motilal Oswal Securities, said it recommended buying into shares of Burroughs Wellcome India as a cheaper route to buying into Glaxo India Ltd.</p>
<p>"(An) imminent merger with Glaxo India with the merger ratio looking quite favourable to Burroughs shareholders makes it an attractive opportunity to invest in Glaxo at a substantially lower price," Inquire analyst Nishid Shah said.</p>
<p>Shares of Glaxo India were traded at 213 rupees on Thursday, up 10 rupees from the previous close. Burroughs Wellcome India was up 7.5 percent at 182 rupees.</p>
<p>"(The) merger will create a formidable player with leadership position in several theapeutic groups and a combined market share of 7.2 percent," it said.</p>
