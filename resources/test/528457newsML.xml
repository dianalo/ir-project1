<p>Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co expects currency exchange rates to continue to trim earnings in the balance of the year but said it expects to implement some price increases to mimimize the impact.</p>
<p>"For the balance of the year it might be in the $0.20 to $0.25 range for the full year," said Marc Adam, vice president of marketing, in an interview. That estimate includes a $0.05 per share impact reported in the 1997 first quarter.  </p>
<p>3M reported its 1997 first quarter per share earnings rose 14 percent from the same period a year ago to $0.99 despite changes in currency exchange rates which cut earnings by an estimated $0.05 share.</p>
<p>According to First Call, earnings came in a penny above the consensus estimate of $0.98. The range of estimates from eight analysts was $0.96 to $1.00.</p>
<p>Sales for the quarter totaled $3.7 billion, an increase of about 11 percent in local currencies and 7.1 percent in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>Shares of 3M were trading up 3-7/8 to 87.  </p>
<p>For the 1997 year, Adam backs an earnings estimate range of $4.05-$4.10, up from the $3.63 earned in 1996.</p>
<p>"We are comfortable with that consensus," Adam said.</p>
<p>"We think we can get some price increases for the balance of the year that's going to help to balance the negative currency impact," Adam said in a telephone interview from the company's St. Paul, Minn. headquarters.</p>
<p>Adam said that selective price increases of about one percent would help to minimize the currency impact.  </p>
<p>In addition, 3M expects to benefit from expansion in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The company has added 600 sales people and technical support services to develop these growth markets.</p>
<p>Adam said expansion in these markets will help balance slower growth rates in some European economies.</p>
<p>Worldwide volume grew 11 percent, fuelled by gains in the United States, the Asia Pacific region and Latin America.</p>
<p>Volume growth in the United States was 12 percent and in Asia Pacific including Japan, growth was 15 percent. Latin America has had 20 percent growth and that continues very strong, he said.</p>
<p>In Europe, volume growth grew by seven percent which showed some improvement. "European economies are not that buoyant, but we believe that we can continue to have a respectable year in Europe," Adam said. "We are not counting on the economy. We are counting on our own initiatives, including new products, focus on customers, and productivity."</p>
<p>Overall, he said, "We are optimistic we will have a good operating performance that we believe will sustain a good double-digit type of year," he said.</p>
