<p>The European Commission is unlikely to rule before September on British Airways's planned cooperation deal with AMR Corp's American Airlines, a Commission official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Anti-trust officials from the EU's 15 countries are due to discuss the planned tie-up at an advisory meeting on July 23, the official said, meaning final clearance is likely to slip into September.</p>
<p>"I think there will be quite a bit of negotiation after the advisory committee, which means that it would be sometime in the autumn that this would finally be decided," said the official, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>The two airlines plan to coordinate all passenger and cargo arrangements between Europe and the United States, with shared benefits and pooled revenue.</p>
<p>The proposed deal, challenged in July last year by the Commission, would also involve flight code sharing across the companies' global networks and the set-up of a fully reciprocal frequent flyer programme.</p>
<p>British Airways chief executive (corrects from chairman) Robert Ayling is due in Brussels on Friday to meet with European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert, his third trip at least to the European Commission in an effort to secure EU clearance.</p>
