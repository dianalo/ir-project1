<p>British water and sewerage firm Wessex Water Plc said on Tuesday that it was "actively pursuing other options that will deliver higher returns" to shareholders after its proposed bid for South West Water was blocked.</p>
<p>It said pretax profits for the six months ending September 30 rose 10.4 percent to 75.5 million pounds ($127.2 million) and paid out a dividend of 5.7 pence, up 14 percent from a year ago.  </p>
<p>Wessex said it was disappointed by the UK government's block on its proposed bid for fellow water firm South West Water in October along with a rival plan from Severn Trent.</p>
<p>"We remain committed to a strategy of leading the water industry in quality of service to customers, developing a significant stream of earnings not subject to price regulation and delivering higher returns to shareholders," chairman Nicholas Hood said in a statement.</p>
<p>Wessex said operational expenditure had been cut by four percent in the water business in the first half and that momentum should continue for the full year while the balance sheet was strong with net cash of 75 million pounds.</p>
<p>It said its UK Waste business continued to make a "growing contribution" to results but added that lower prices for waste paper and cardboard had affected profitability at its recycling business and UK Waste's profit growth.</p>
