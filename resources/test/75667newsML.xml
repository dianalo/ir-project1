<p>Service Corp International, North America's largest operator of funeral homes and cemeteries, is widely expected next week to launch a hostile takeover bid for Loewen Group Inc after the number-two rival spurned a $2.8 billion acquisition offer.</p>
<p>Industry analysts said the move would be an aggressive attempt by Service Corp to pressure Loewen management into negotiating a transaction.</p>
<p>"I think (a hostile bid) looks fairly assured," said Kara Cheseby of Legg Mason Wood Walker.</p>
<p>Service Corp earlier said it will hold a board meeting on October 1 to review its options, virtually convincing industry experts and takeover traders that its next step will be a formal hostile takeover bid.</p>
<p>After meeting nearly seven hours on Tuesday, Loewen rejected the unsolicited $43 per share stock offer disclosed last week. Loewen said the bid was inadequate and that it plans to remain independent.</p>
<p>Industry analysts and takeover traders expect Service Corp to launch a $43 per share tender offer or a proposal to swap Loewen shares for Service Corp stock.</p>
<p>Service Corp could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>"I think (Service Corp) ought to withdraw their offer and that will really anger the Loewen shareholders," said Todd Richter of Dean Witter. However, he admitted that Service Corp is unlikely to walk away from the proposed transaction.</p>
<p>Instead, he speculated Service Corp may try to lure shareholders by offering a higher price in a tender offer.</p>
<p>The belief that Service Corp will pursue Loewen on a hostile basis comes mainly from the Houston-based company's aggressive track record.</p>
<p>Service Corp successfully wooed funeral firm Great Southern Group Plc of Britian two years ago despite an initial rejection. Service eventually paid $174.1 million for the British business after hiking its offer twice in order to lure Great Southern, which was holding talks with Loewen and another potential buyer.</p>
<p>And just a few weeks later, it bought Plantsbrook Plc, also of Britian, for $290 million. The two acquisitions gave Service Corp a 15 percent stake in the British funeral home market.</p>
<p>"My money is on them," said Cheseby of Service Corp, who thinks Loewen will fall to its suitor at a price above the initial offer of $43 per share.</p>
<p>Service Corp appealed directly to Loewen shareholders on Wednesday, saying that Loewen's rejection "simply deprive its stockholders of the opportunity to receive prompt value for their shares."</p>
<p>Service Corp also pointed out that the $43 per share bid represents a 48.9 percent premium to the price at which Loewen shares were trading 30 days before the offer.</p>
