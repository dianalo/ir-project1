<p>Switzerland, pressed by foreign critics, pledged on Tuesday to answer by December 4 accusations that it used the wealth of Holocaust victims to compensate Swiss citizens for property seized in eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry named two Swiss historians to examine compensation deals reached after World War Two with the then-communist regimes of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Romania and Hungary.</p>
<p>The move was announced by top diplomat Thomas Borer, who heads a task force on mending damage to Switzerland's world reputation from a barrage of allegations that the neutral Swiss cynically profitted from the misery of World War Two.</p>
<p>"We've given the historians a clear deadline of one month. They have to deliver their report by December 4," Borer told Reuters by telephone from Berne.</p>
<p>"They are to look especially at the question of whether and to what extent ownerless assets left by citizens of these countries were incorporated in the compensation treaties."</p>
<p>Borer, a 39-year-old troubleshooter for Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti, said it was possible that the historians' findings could lead to political consequences but declined to speculate on what those might be.</p>
<p>"We want to know the truth not just for truth's sake but also, if appropriate, in order to propose measures to the Federal Council (cabinet)," he said.</p>
<p>"Our strategic goal is to preserve the image of Switzerland abroad," he said of his task force, set up last Friday to coordinate the government's probes into what happened to wealth stashed in Switzerland by Holocaust victims and Nazis.</p>
<p>Switzerland has struggled to cope with a flood of criticism from world Jewish groups about the way it handled accounts left ownerless by murdered Jews and other victims of Nazi persecution.</p>
<p>The controvery was fuelled by the rediscovery of a 1949 deal with Poland that allowed Warsaw to pay off Swiss claims for nationalised property through a clearing account funded in part by Poles' unclaimed Swiss assets.</p>
<p>A similar pact was reached with Hungary. Berne has not yet said whether dormant accounts were also used in compensation treaties with other communist states.</p>
<p>Jewish groups say much of the dormant money in the pact with Poland was deposited by Jews killed in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>The two Swiss historians studying the texts are Marc Perrenoud and Peter Hug. Hug has said Switzerland and other countries did not do enough after World War Two to identify eastern European owners or heirs of Swiss bank accounts.</p>
<p>In addition to the review of compensation pacts with East Europe, Switzerland is tracking down wealth left by Holocaust victims and Nazis in three ways.</p>
<p>A banking ombudsman is coordinating nearly 1,000 claims that have been submitted and an independent panel set up by Jewish groups and Swiss bankers will also comb bank records for unclaimed wealth that may have escaped two previous sweeps.</p>
<p>Parliament is also set to give final approval in December to a panel of historians and experts empowered to lift strict banking secrecy and conduct a sweeping review of the era.</p>
