<p>The German mark was in focus in foreign currency futures trading on the Budapest Commodity Exchange (BCE) on Thursday.</p>
<p>The BCE's turnover was a below-average 2.56 billion forints, down from 2.84 billion forints on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The mark accounted for 8,800 lots of the total 15,946 traded on Thursday, with the September maturity for the mark taking out 4,300 lots and December 4,500 lots.</p>
<p>"In the past few days a fair amount of connected mark and yen deals were struck," said Swap Broker's Janos Szolyka. "Banks sold yen and bought mark."</p>
<p>He added that the mark-yen deals had been popular since the yen showed weakness in the crosses.</p>
<p>The mark closed at 112.30 forints for the September maturity, down 10 fillers, while the December maturity rose two pips to 116.43 forints.</p>
<p>The yen was traded for only the March 1998 maturity, in 1,500 lots, and dropped five fillers to 166.80 forints for 100 units.</p>
<p>The dollar was traded for June and September. These maturities firmed by 45 fillers and 35 fillers respectively, to 185.20 and 191.50 forints.</p>
<p>"The market expects the dollar to continue to firm following the upcoming G7 meeting," Szolyka said.</p>
<p>On the Budapest Stock Exchange's foreign exchange futures market almost all settlement prices remained flat, except for December mark which firmed 1.2 forints to 117.2 in 100 lots.</p>
<p>The central bank fixed the forint at 181.05 to one dollar on Thursday, down 50 pips from Wednesday, while the mark firmed seven pips to 105.38 and the yen (100 units) rose 33 fillers to 143.54.</p>
