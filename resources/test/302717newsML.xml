<headline>Brazil court rejects re-election injunction plea.</headline>
<dateline>BRASILIA 1997-01-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brazil's highest court, the Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF), has ruled that the government may continue in its attempts to seek Congressional approval of its re-election initiative during January, an STF spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>STF president Sepulveda Pertence rejected the arguments of the Brazilian Progressive Party, which sought an injunction suspending any votes on re-election during a special, month-long session of the Congress, the spokeswoman said.  </p>
<p>The injunction request was the latest attempt by the party to short-circuit the government's efforts to get re-election sanctioned by Congress.</p>
<p>The PPB includes Paulo Maluf, the former mayor of Sao Paulo whose own presidential ambitions depend largely on sidelining President Fernando Henrique Cardoso from the 1998 elections.</p>
