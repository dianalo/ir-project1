<title>USA: Police narrow suspects in Colorado child's murder.</title>
<headline>Police narrow suspects in Colorado child's murder.</headline>
<dateline>BOULDER, Colo 1997-01-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Police have been able to narrow the number of suspects in the nearly month-long investigation into the murder of six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, a Boulder police spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We have been able to eliminate some people who do not appear to have had access to JonBenet," Kelvin McNeill said.</p>
<p>The body of the beauty pageant winner was found Dec. 26 by her father in the basement of the family's home in a posh Boulder neighbourhood some eight hours after her mother said she found a ransom note demanding $118,000.</p>
<p>KMGH-TV in Denver reported the ransom note coincidentally matched a bonus JonBenet's father John Ramsey received from his computer company for 1995 that was paid in early 1996, some 11 months before the murder.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the family did not return repeated phone calls to comment on the note.</p>
<p>McNeill declined to say how many possible suspects the police are looking at. "We're not going to play a daily numbers game," he said.</p>
<p>National media have been camping out in Boulder, hoping to ferret out clues into the murder of the little girl whom published reports also said was sexually assaulted before she was murdered.</p>
