<title>MEXICO: Son of Mexico City mayor-elect resigns post.</title>
<headline>Son of Mexico City mayor-elect resigns post.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-07-24</dateline>

<p>Facing a firestorm of nepotism charges, the son of Mexico City's mayor-elect has resigned from his father's staff.</p>
<p>The resignation late Wednesday of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Batel, 30, appeared likely to stem a brewing controversy for Mayor-elect Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, who made history when he was elected July 6 as the first opposition leader of Mexico's capital city in 68 years under the ruling party.</p>
<p>Until now the post had been a presidential appointment.</p>
<p>Charges of nepotism were splashed over the front pages of Mexican newspapers after Cardenas, 63, appointed his son to a key six-person team to ensure a smooth handover of power in December.</p>
<p>The mayor-elect had said members of his transition team very likely would serve in his government.</p>
<p>Cardenas Batel said in his resignation letter, released late Wednesday, that he did not want to become an obstacle to his father's political fortunes.</p>
<p>"My resignation should not be taken as a first stumble but to the contrary it should demonstrate without a doubt that this will be a new city government...with the sensitivity to listen to the people and exercise power with humility, transparency, integrity and principles," the son said.</p>
<p>The older Cardenas, a twice-failed presidential candidate, is founder of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). He defected from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the 1980s.</p>
<p>His son's role became public on Tuesday when the mayor-elect and a team of advisers visited the outgoing leader of Mexico City, Oscar Espinoza Villareal.</p>
<p>At a news conference after the meeting, Cardenas said there was "no doubt at all" the six collaborators would form part of his cabinet.</p>
<p>But after reporters raised questions of nepotism, the left-wing leader was forced to row back -- though he complained of "wrongful and fraudulent interpretations" about his son's unpaid position.</p>
