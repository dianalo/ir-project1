<p>A German television journalist was convicted of fraud on Monday for selling bogus documentaries featuring staged racist gatherings, cat shootings, drug smuggling and bomb-making operations.</p>
<p>Michael Born, a 38-year-old TV journalist who claimed he was merely giving the networks what they asked for, was immediately sentenced to four years jail by a state court in this west German town.</p>
<p>The court found Born guilty of 17 counts of fraud and three counts of attempted fraud. He was also convicted of inciting racial hatred and faking a criminal act.</p>
<p>Born sold 32 fraudulent documentaries to German and Swiss networks. He pleaded guilty but said network executives aired his films knowing some segments were not authentic.</p>
<p>The bogus material appeared in the early 1990s in many of Germany's best-known magazine-style news broadcasts, such as Stern TV on network RTL, Spiegel TV on Vox and ZAK on public broadcaster ARD.</p>
<p>Judge Ulrich Weiland said prosecutors, who had demanded a five-year prison term, had proved Born supplied the programmes with fabricated film footage.</p>
<p>"The claim from Born that the TV programmes were to blame or were co-conspirators was proved to be false," Weiland said.</p>
<p>But Weiland singled out Stern TV for special criticism, saying it failed to adequately check Born's film contributions because they were more interested in obtaining good ratings.</p>
<p>"The programmes were victims of fraud, even if the faked films could have been seen as such with a more critical examination," Weiland said.</p>
<p>Fierce competition for ratings in Germany's rapidly growing television market, the world's second richest behind the United States, has led to many magazine-style TV programmes pulling out all the stops to obtain dramatic film footage.</p>
<p>Saying he was fulfilling network orders to provide exclusive film, Born delivered staged scenes of such things as German Ku Klux Klan members burning books, Kurdish bomb-makers and drug smugglers crossing the border into Germany.</p>
<p>Born, who received 350,000 marks ($225,500) for his films, also staged one scene of men shooting a cat in the forest.</p>
<p>"The concrete demand is: they want film of something that is happening out there somewhere in the world, but for which film is not available," said Born from custody earlier this year.</p>
<p>"They say "you bring us pictures of these things that no one else has and no one else can possibly have'. You make the impossible possible." ($1=1.5521 Mark)</p>
