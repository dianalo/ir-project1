<p>The Afghan Taleban government's former foreign minister Mullah Mohammad Ghous is free from opposition captivity in the north of the country, a Pakistan-based Afghan news service reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) quoted a Taleban spokesman as saying that Ghous, who was reported to have been detained in late May in the opposition-held northern town of Mazar-i-Sharif, had arrived in the Taleban-held northern town of Kunduz with six companions.  </p>
<p>It was not immediately known whether Ghous, who was replaced as foreign minister last month because of his absence, and his comrades were released by the opposition forces or had escaped from captivity.</p>
<p>Opposition sources had said that Ghous was detained with several other Taleban officials when the forces commanded by northern opposition leader General Abdul Malik drove Taleban forces out of Mazar-i-Sharif only a few days after they had captured the town with his support.</p>
<p>The Taleban had set the release of its officials and hundreds of its captured fighters as a precondition for peace talks with opposition forces.</p>
