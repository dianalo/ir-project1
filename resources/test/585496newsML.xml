<p>Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz said on Thursday that he has chosen a new coach for next season and it is not Arrigo Sacchi, manager of troubled AC Milan.</p>
<p>"I know who is going to train Real Madrid. I haven't made an offer to Arrigo Sacchi," said Sanz.</p>
<p>With Sacchi out of the reckoning, Tenerife's Jupp Heynckes becomes the clear favourite to take over from Fabio Capello, who has announced that he will leave Real at the end of the season.</p>
<p>Sanz also dismissed reports that Real players had attempted to persuade Capello to stay on. "Capello has gone, what the players have to do is play, and it will be the club board that decides," he said.</p>
