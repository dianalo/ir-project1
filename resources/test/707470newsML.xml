<p>Japan's troubled construction sector saw its second-biggest post-war failure Friday when a medium-sized contractor sought protection from its creditors after buckling under massive "bubble"-era problem loans.</p>
<p>Tokyo-based Tokai Kogyo Co. Ltd said it filed for court protection from its creditors after abandoning a plan to rebuild its troubled business.</p>
<p>It became the first listed general contractor to go under in Japan's post-war history.</p>
<p>It was the second major failure by a Japanese general contractor in the past four years. Osaka-based Muramoto Construction Co Ltd went under in 1993 with 530 billion yen ($4.69 billion) in debts.</p>
<p>Tokai, listed on the first section of the Tokyo bourse, said it was burdened with debts of 511 billion yen ($4.52 billion). It also tops the list of Japanese builders which have guaranteed huge loans which may not be recoverable.</p>
<p>Tokai's shares were suspended by the Tokyo stock market after they fell on the news and are due to be delisted on Oct. 5.</p>
<p>The news about Tokai renewed market jitters over the fragile health of Japan's construction sector, a major casuality of Japan's bad loan crisis, and prompted sales in shares like Tobishima Corp and Aoki Corp.</p>
<p>Japan's construction firms have been struggling to recover from the collapse of Japan's 1980s "bubble" of sky-high asset prices, which left them heavily encumbered with problem loans. Builders led the bubble-era investment in property and real estate and also guaranteed loans by their real estate units.</p>
<p>The sluggish pace of Japan's economic recovery, coupled with lingering loan woes and a squeeze on public works spending, is putting heavy pressure on builders' earnings and has made any substantial turnarounds doubtful.</p>
<p>Tokai, hit by sluggish property sales and falling land prices, had tried but failed to win necessary financial support from all of its four major banks -- Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd, Tokai Bank Ltd, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Norinchukin Bank.</p>
