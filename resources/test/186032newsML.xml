<p>Colombia's army commander conceded on Wednesday that about 4,000 minors were serving in the country's embattled military, a practice condemned in a U.N. report.</p>
<p>"The latest statistics I've read show that we have about 4,000 soldiers under 18," Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett said.</p>
<p>He stressed that none of the youths -- boys aged 15 to 18 -- were in combat zones. Service in such zones has been prohibited by a constitutional court.</p>
<p>Bonett, appointed army commander two weeks ago, spoke at a news conference at which UNICEF presented a scathing report on child recruitment by the army and leftist guerrillas.</p>
<p>"Children in Colombia have suffered extreme violence in terms of deaths, injuries, abuse, torture, psychological trauma and recruitment into the armed forces and rebel groups," the report said.</p>
<p>"UNICEF asks the Colombian government to ban the recruitment of children and adopt 18 as the minimum age," it said. The U.N. agency's report was part of a study of the effects of armed conflict on children worldwide.</p>
<p>Colombia's human rights ombudsman estimates that as many as 2,500 members of the leftist guerrilla forces, both male and female, were under 18, the legal age of majority in the country. The guerrillas are waging one of their bloodiest offensives in three decades.</p>
<p>The Colombian Army cut the lower age limit for recruitment from 18 to 15 earlier this year in a move that went virtually unnoticed by the media.</p>
<p>This week Bonett said the army hoped to double the number of its combatants to about 200,000. The army has suffered serious setbacks in the last 2-1/2 months.</p>
<p>Technically the army requires parents' permission before signing up anyone under 18. But a Bogota-based UNICEF spokeswoman said many youths from low-income families had few alternatives.</p>
<p>"There are a variety of reasons why children as young as 15 are being recruited. It's cheaper, and at that age it may be easier to mould their ideas (in counterinsurgency tactics)," she said after the news conference.</p>
<p>The Colombian Army has frequently been criticised by international watchdogs for what they call its flagrant human rights violations. But until now most allegations have involved extrajudicial killings, links to paramilitary groups, and the torture of political dissidents and suspected guerrillas.</p>
<p>At the end of last month, London-based Amnesty International called for the suspension of all U.S. military aid to the Colombian Army until rights issues were addressed.</p>
