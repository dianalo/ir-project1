<title>USA: Triple murderer dies in Georgia electric chair.</title>
<headline>Triple murderer dies in Georgia electric chair.</headline>
<dateline>JACKSON, Ga. 1996-11-14</dateline>

<p>A self-described "cold- blooded killer" who had twice waited until the last minute to appeal his death sentence was put to death in Georgia's electric chair early on Thursday.</p>
<p>Larry Lonchar, who described himself as a "cold-blooded killer," was pronounced dead at 12:31 a.m. EST (0531 GMT) at the Georgia prison system's Diagnostic and Classification Centre. His execution was originally scheduled for Wednesday but was delayed by last-minute appeals.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old triple murderer had a history of changing his mind about whether he wanted to be executed. He was within 32 minutes of dying in 1993 when he decided to appeal his sentence for the first time. A few days later, he said he changed his mind and was ready to die.</p>
<p>On June 29, 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court granted Lonchar a stay one minute before he was scheduled to die in Georgia's electric chair, based on his claims that he wished to donate his organs to a retired police detective who suffers from kidney failure. He dropped that appeal last month.</p>
<p>Lonchar was given the death sentence in 1987 for murdering Charles Wayne Smith, Steven Smith and Margaret Sweat over a $10,000 gambling debt.</p>
<p>Another condemned killer, Ellis Wayne Felker, was scheduled to be executed on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Capital punishment was banned in the United States by the Supreme Court in 1972, but only four years later, the court ruled states could resume it -- and most promptly did.</p>
<p>The death penalty is back on the books in 38 states and is used most often in Southern states, especially Texas and Florida. New York reinstituted it last year.</p>
