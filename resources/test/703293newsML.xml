<p>Umberto Bossi, firebrand leader of the Northern League, went on trial on charges of incitement to violence on Wednesday for urging followers to take action against those who voted for Italy's far-right party.</p>
<p>Bossi did not attend the start of the trial in this northern Italian city where he made the controversial appeal.</p>
<p>"If you know of someone who voted for the National Alliance, take down their names. I'm not joking about this. At the right moment, if it's necessary, the League will go from house to house and take them," he told followers.</p>
<p>At the trial's opening, Gianfranco Fini, head of the far-right National Alliance (AN) party and other AN leaders filed a civil suit for damages.</p>
<p>Bossi is due to be tried on the same charges by a court in the northeastern town of Tolmezzo, where he made similar comments.</p>
<p>He also has been indicted on charges of insulting President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro by comparing the head of state to Rasputin, the shadowy monk who wielded influence over the Russian Tsarina before the 1917 revolution.</p>
<p>Bossi, who wants independence for Italy's rich north, has already been sentenced to eight months in another court case involving illegal party financing.</p>
