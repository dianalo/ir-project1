<p>Honda Motor Co Ltd said on Thursday it has no plan to change its current programme to boost production capacity at its British unit regardless of Britain's position on European economic and monetary union (EMU).  </p>
<p>Honda said it has shown its commitment to Europe with investment plans totalling 700 million stg for its car plant, Honda of the U.K. Mfg Ltd in Swindon, England.</p>
<p>"No changes will be made to Honda's plans (for the plant), which was announced in 1994 to boost British output, whether or not Britain decides to join European monetary union," a Honda spokesman said.</p>
<p>In June 1994, Honda announced it would invest another 300 million stg to boost car production capacity to 150,000 units by the year 1998 from 100,000, bringing its cumulative investment to 700 million stg.</p>
<p>The 300 million stg in new investment comprises 60 million stg to increase output capacity and 240 million stg to launch new models.</p>
