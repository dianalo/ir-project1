<p>Wall Street shares are expected to open steady to modestly firmer on Monday, with a stream of second quarter earnings releases giving direction to the broader stock market in the absence of economic data.</p>
<p>"We're now in full earnings season, so the market will obviously pay pretty close attention to earnings reports through the week," Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments said.  </p>
<p>Archer Daniels Midland Co, Bank of New York Co Inc, CPC International Inc, MCI Communications Inc and Pfizer Inc were among large companies scheduled to report today.</p>
<p>"The market will be watching earnings most of the week and we will probably get some positive surprises," said Thom Brown, managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood.</p>
<p>Analysts said the stock market would look to earnings reports to find the positive sentiment necessary to propel the Dow Jones industrial average above the closely-watched 8,000 level.  </p>
<p>"A lot depends on earnings today," Cardillo said. "We might have another attempt at 8,000, but the question is will the market overcome sell programs as we approach that level."</p>
<p>Shares of Dow component DuPont Co would also be active, after Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries agreed to sell DuPont its polyester polymer, titanium dioxide and polyester film business for $3 billion, Brown said.</p>
<p>"This is a big plus for DuPont," he said. "It beefs up their whole chemical business."</p>
<p>In early trade, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures index rose 0.95 points to 925.35.  </p>
<p>The long bond fell 8/32 to yield 6.55 percent.</p>
<p>Later in the week, industrial production data and the consumer price index for June would also guide stocks and bonds, analysts said. Both data were due on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Japan's Nikkei average closed up 353.23 points, or 1.78 percent, at 20,228.72.</p>
<p>In London, the FTSE 100 was up 37.1 at 4836.6.</p>
<p>U.S. stocks were mixed in thin London trading, as European investors awaited this week's earnings reports.  </p>
<p>The dollar was confined to a tight range against the yen in Tokyo, trading at 113.65/75 yen. In Europe, the dollar was firm at 1.7908/18 marks.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal said in its Heard on the Street column that shareholders of mutual fund company Pioneer Group of Boston are wondering why the firm has not been purchased, despite frequent offers.  </p>
<p>The New York Times said in its Market Place column that, according to analysts who have spoken to company executives, Time Warner Inc has indicated its music division is likely to report a 25 percent decline in operating cash flow for the second quarter.</p>
