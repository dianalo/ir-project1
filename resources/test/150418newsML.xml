<headline>INTERVIEW - Funds can defeat raiders with hybrids.</headline>

<p>Hybrid mutual funds are one of the best ways to fend off corporate raiders, a legal expert on mutual funds said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"A closed-end fund is usually hampered by liquidity, which means it trades at a discount to net asset value and opens an avenue of attack to the mutual fund raider," Anthony Travers of law firm Maples and Calder told an industry conference in Jakarta.</p>
<p>"But a hybrid fund can offer the promise of liquidity and defuse the problem," he said.</p>
<p>Closed-end funds usually require investors to contribute at a fixed price and date for redemption or liquidation at a fixed future date.</p>
<p>Open-end funds start at a fixed price and date but receive period valuations of net asset value, allowing investors to move in and out at that price.</p>
<p>This requires liquidity in the fund or the power to borrow to meet redemption.</p>
<p>"It is a great mutual fund truth that if you cannot value accurately you cannot bring new investors in or let existing investors out which means you must have a closed-ended fund," Travers said.</p>
<p>Closed-end funds are suitable for venture capital or real estate projects where the assets are illiquid or difficult to value, he said. They were used extensively to finance the start-up of many Silicon Valley companies in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>But closed-end funds are increasingly at risk from mutual fund raiders who seek unit-holder support with promises of an immediate return on early liquidation.</p>
<p>"This is becoming more common," Travers said. "We have seen mutual fund raiders in Hong Kong, some of which have been successful."</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Regent Pacific Group Ltd, a mid-sized investment company, recently failed in its attempts to persuade shareholders in mutual fund Pioneer Industries International (Holdings) Ltd to sell its primary asset, a 3.77 percent stake in Bangkok Bank Ltd.</p>
<p>Regent, which owns 20 percent of Pioneer, is now seeking shareholder support to force the sale of various subsidiaries of Britain's Hambros Plc, in which Pioneer holds a three percent stake.</p>
