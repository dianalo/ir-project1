<p>United Parcel Service warned on Tuesday that the Teamsters union would lose some 15,000 jobs unless a nine-day-old strike against the huge package delivery company ended soon.</p>
<p>UPS Chief Executive James Kelly issued the blunt assessment as the company stepped up a public relations campaign aimed at getting the union to put the UPS contract offer to a vote of members.</p>
<p>"We reviewed yesterday the impact of this strike after two weeks, after four weeks and after six months, and the conditions now are that we'll have 15,000 fewer Teamsters jobs if the strike ends in two weeks," Kelly told NBC's "Today" show. "And the longer it goes on, the fewer jobs we'll have, so this is about destroying jobs at UPS," he said.</p>
<p>UPS took out full-page advertisements in several major newspapers attacking the union and calling on the Teamsters to put the UPS contract offer to a membership vote.</p>
<p>"If the Teamsters leaders are truly concerned with the best interests of their members, they will present this offer for a vote. If they are interested in pursuing their own political agenda, and protecting their control of billions of dolars in pension funds, then they will prolong the strike," UPS said in the ads, which were published in newspapers that included the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post.</p>
<p>Labour Secretary Alexis Herman met with both sides separately on Monday but failed to get them to agree to resume face-to-face talks.</p>
<p>Herman was likely to brief President Bill Clinton as he flew to St. Louis Tuesday for a speech on welfare, a White House official said.</p>
<p>"They are likely to have an opportunity to talk about the UPS strike on the way there," said the official.</p>
<p>UPS normally handles 12 million packages a day using 185,000 Teamster members out of a total work force of 301,000 people.</p>
<p>Before the strike, Atlanta-based UPS delivered about 80 percent of all packages shipped by ground nationwide.</p>
<p>The strike has hit many businesses that relied on UPS for timely delivery to customers or for receiving essential supplies.</p>
<p>Teamsters President Ron Carey told reporters after his meeting with Herman on Monday that he was ready to go back to the bargaining table, but only for serious negotiations.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to spend any more time out there chit-chatting," Carey said. On Saturday, Carey said further talks would be fruitless because UPS was unwilling to improve its contract offer.</p>
<p>UPS negotiator Dave Murray said the company was not changing its offer despite Herman's calls for flexibility. "We still believe that the correct solution to this is for the Teamsters to put our people back to work and send our offer out for a vote," Murray said.</p>
<p>The Teamsters set a news conference for 12.30 p.m. EDT (1630 GMT) on Tuesday in Washington to discuss the strike, while UPS set its press briefing for 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).</p>
<p>UPS wrote to all Congress members Monday, asking them to urge President Clinton to end the strike. But the White House has so far insisted that the economic disruption is not great enough to justify intervention under the Taft-Hartley law.</p>
