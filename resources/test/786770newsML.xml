<p>Five United Nations peacekeepers were killed when their helicopter crashed in south Lebanon on Wednesday, a U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) spokesman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the cause of the crash was not immediately clear. The helicopter crashed inside Israel's occupation zone in south Lebanon.</p>
<p>"Five were killed. The helicopter went down in the Bint Jbeil area. We are firing flares to help with the recovery work," the spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>"We are headed towards the crash site. We are a few kilometers away," he said.</p>
<p>UNIFIL did not yet know the nationalities of those killed, the spokesman said, "but the pilot and copilot were obviously Italian because all of our pilots and co-pilots are Italian".</p>
<p>"It will probably take until the morning until we find out further details," he added.</p>
<p>The 4,488-member UNIFIL force was established in 1978 to restore the Lebanese government's authority over the southern part of the country after an Israeli incursion against Palestinian guerrillas.</p>
<p>After Israel withdrew its troops following a 1982 invasion, it retained a so-called security zone along the Lebanese side of the border, aided by its allies of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia, to block attacks against northern Israel.</p>
<p>The U.N. force consists of contingents from Fiji, Finland, France, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal, Norway and Poland.</p>
