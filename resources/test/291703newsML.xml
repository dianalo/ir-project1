<p>British confectionery sales grew by five percent last year to a record 4.9 billion pounds ($8.28 billion), according to a review by Cadbury  and its sweet-making arm Trebor Bassett on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Volume sales rose by two percent to 833,000 tonnes, a growth of more than 12 percent over the last decade, said the Confectionary Market Review review.</p>
<p>One hundred years after Cadbury launched the first milk chocolate bar in Britain, the nation has become one of the highest confectionery consumers in the world eating an average 13 kilos each a year, exceeded only by Denmark and Ireland.</p>
<p>Chocolate continues to make up most of the confectionary market with 70 percent of sales at 3.4 billion pounds while sweets accounted for 30 percent at 1.5 billion, said the review.</p>
<p>Cadbury holds a 20 percent share of total confectionery and Trebor Bassett 10 percent. This compares with other key players Nestle Rowntree with 20 percent and Mars with 18 percent.</p>
<p>The Cadbury brothers launched Britain's first milk chocolate in 1897 in three penny and six penny packs. It was the forerunner of Cadbury's Dairy Milk which went on sale in 1905. Milk chocolate now accounts for almost 90 percent of chocolate eaten in Britain, where there are about 500 different confectionary brands on sale.</p>
