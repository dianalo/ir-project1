<p>An emergency special session of the General Assembly on Israeli building in East Jerusalem will be convened on Thursday, a U.N. spokesman said late Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 22-member Arab group of states requested the session at the end of March but it has taken since then to obtain the endorsement of the required majority of the assembly's 185 members.</p>
<p>"Since the required amount of favourable responses has been received, the General Assembly will convene on Thursday, April 24, at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) to consider the situation in East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied territories," the U.N. spokesman said.</p>
<p>The session, expected to last two days, was requested under a 1950 "uniting for peace" procedure that enables an issue considered to be a threat to peace to be transferred to the assembly if action by the Security Council has been blocked by a veto.</p>
<p>The United States used its veto on March 7 and again on March 21 to prevent the adoption of council resolutions calling on Israel to abandon plans to build 6,500 homes for Jews on a site between Jerusalem and Bethlehem called Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic and Har Homa in Hebrew. Israel captured the area in the 1967 Middle East War.</p>
<p>Israel regards the undivided city of Jerusalem, including the eastern part captured in 1967, as its eternal capital while the Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state.</p>
<p>The request for the emergency assembly session was supported by the 113-member non-aligned movement at a meeting earlier this month in New Delhi, as well as by the 54-member Organisation of the Islamic Conference. But states must individually notify the U.N. secretariat of their backing.</p>
<p>The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has been seeking support for a proposed resolution condemning "the construction by Israel, the occupying power, of a new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim to the south of occupied East Jerusalem and all other illegal Israeli actions in all the occupied territories."</p>
<p>The draft, still subject to change, would recommend that all countries bar any assistance to Israeli private or public establishments involved in settlement activities.</p>
<p>It would also recommend that signatories to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which bars settlements in occupied territories, "take other legally appropriate measures, on a national or regional level," to ensure it is respected by Israel.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Kofi Annan would be asked to "monitor the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem, through the dispatch of a team of United Nations observers and the use of available resources, and to submit a report on the implementation of this resolution" within two months of its adoption.</p>
<p>Assembly resolutions are not binding and only the Security Council can impose mandatory sanctions.</p>
<p>The emergency special assembly session will mark the fourth time the controversial building project has been debated at the United Nations.</p>
<p>In addition to the two Security Council debates which ended with U.S. vetoes, a non-emergency meeting of the General Assembly adopted a resolution on March 13 by a vote of 130 to two, with two abstentions, calling on Israel to abandon its construction plan. Work on the site began five days later.</p>
