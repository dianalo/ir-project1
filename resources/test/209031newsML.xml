<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn told an economic forum on Friday that Hungary would stick to free-market reforms and austerity measures to stabilise its economy.</p>
<p>"We want to go on with our stabilisation policy and reforms because Hungary has no other choice," Horn said. "Hungary is a small and open country and it has no alternative."</p>
<p>"I would wish to say that in the past two and a half years we have been able to overcome the crisis and by doing so there has been no decline in the economic performance, even if economic growth has gone down," Horn said, referring to runaway inflation and deficits which hit Hungary's economy in early 1995.</p>
<p>Horn spoke at a forum for diplomats and businessmen where he and other ministers responsible for the economy summarised accomplishments since his Hungarian Socialist Party, comprised largely of former communists, took office in 1994.</p>
<p>Horn reiterated his commitments to take Hungary into the European Union and NATO and said his government had made great strides in bringing the economy into line with Western Europe.</p>
<p>Cited as among major achievements was a drop in interest rates, which have been cut to 22 percent for prime customers from 31 percent 15 months ago.</p>
<p>Inflation, which once topped some 30 percent per year, has been brought down to about 23 percent per year and should continue to decline, although energy price increases announced by the government on Thursday to take effect in January will have an impact.</p>
<p>Horn said the government was watching inflation closely and hoped to be able soon to revise the country's crawling peg devaluation policy, under which the forint is now devalued 1.2 percent every month.</p>
<p>"I think this should be dependent on the results we will achieve in the first months of 1997," Horn said.</p>
<p>He also defended the government's handling of the energy price hike, which is intended to bring Hungarian rates more in line with those in the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>Consumers smarting over declines in earning power for two years running are angry over the increases while foreign investors who have bought large segments of Hungary's utility sector say the rate hikes are insufficient.</p>
<p>"I can safely say that our decision taken yesterday means that for the first time in Hungary prices will be proportional to costs with respect to energy and fuels and for the first time the energy sector will make a profit," Horn said.</p>
<p>He said that in its 1997 budget Hungary would continue to reform its deficit-making social security system in line with proposals to make it more self-sufficient.</p>
<p>"You cannot expect us to take radical steps but our budget for 1997 contains some important measures as far as social security contributions are concerned and taxation," Horn said.</p>
<p>The ministers also said that despite a recent scandal over millions of dollars paid by Hungary's privatisation agency to a consultant, there would be no let up in selling off state-owned companies and the bulk of what remains would be sold in 1997.</p>
<p>Judit Csiha, the new minister in charge of state privatisation agency APV Rt, said that 12 to 18 percent of the shares the government still holds in gas and oil company MOL would be sold next year, and she said the sale could raise 28 to 40 billion forints.</p>
<p>"By the end of 1997 practically all the companies that can be privatised should be privatised," she said.</p>
