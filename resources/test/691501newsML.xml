<p>The company said the proceeds from the offering, which could be as much as $68 million if the over- allotment option is exercised, will be used to reduce outstanding debt that was incurred to fund its previous growth and acquisition activities.</p>
<p>In addition, the Company is using a portion of the proceeds to redeem warrants to buy 480,750 shares of common stock held by a former lender.</p>
<p>The managing underwriters of the offering are Robinson-Humphrey company Inc, Furman Selz LLC and PaineWebber Inc.</p>
