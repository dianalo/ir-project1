<p>Amoco Corp. said Wednesday it will sell its gas stations in Central Europe as part of its strategy to focus on expanding retail petroleum marketing resources and operations mainly in the Americas.</p>
<p>The sale will include four existing gas stations and 14 others under construction in Poland, Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>About 270 employees in the three countries will be affected by the divestiture, Amoco said.</p>
<p>The company said it hired CS First Boston Corp. to negotiate the sale of the gas stations.</p>
<p>"Although we have been extremely successful with our initial retail marketing activities in Central Europe, the overall international petroleum marketing growth opportunities that we anticipated have not developed to the extent we had hoped over the past several years," said W. Douglas Ford, Amoco executive vice president-petroleum products sector.</p>
<p>"We're confident that these retail sites in Central Europe will prove attractive to potential buyers in a highly competitive market," he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Amoco's investment in Central Europe began in 1989, when it signed an agreement with the Polish government to explore for crude oil and natural gas. In the early 1990s it signed a pact with the Romanian government focusing on exploration and production.</p>
<p>Amoco said it remains committed to its other business interests in Central Europe, which include exploration and production and chemical activities.</p>
<p>Amoco had worldwide revenues of $31 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Its stock rose 87.5 cents to $73.625 on the New York Stock Exchange in late morning trading.</p>
