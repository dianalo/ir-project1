<p>Far East base metal dealers said on Tuesday some 5,000-10,000 tonnes of copper from China will arrive in Singapore shortly, while copper stocks on the London Metal Exchange (LME) should rise anew.</p>
<p>"There's still some material moving from China to Singapore and we estimate it could be about 10,000 tonnes," the general manager of a Japanese metal trading firm said.</p>
<p>Another dealer said he has received reports that about 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes of copper will arrive here soon. Traders estimate 10,000 tonnes of copper arrived in Singapore warehouses last week.  </p>
<p>"We hear there's more stuff coming here from China," a dealer with a European metal trading firm said.</p>
<p>But most of the material will probably not be placed on warrant in the LME warehouse in Singapore, traders said.</p>
<p>"Our best estimate is that about 20,000 tonnes remain off warrant here," one trader said.</p>
<p>Copper stocks on the LME are likely to rise by around 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes later on Tuesday while aluminium should post a modest fall of 1,000-2,000 tonnes, traders said.</p>
<p>But another trader said copper stocks in the LME report, due out at 0900 GMT, are due for "a substantial up."  </p>
<p>"We think it's (the copper stock figure) going to be 5,000 to 8,000 tonnes up," the dealer said.</p>
<p>The amount of copper in the LME warehouse in Singapore climbed last Friday to 12,250 tonnes, up 4,325 tonnes from last Tuesday's figure. Aluminium stocks here reached 22,075 tonnes, down 600 from the last report.</p>
<p>Three month copper prices were quoted in Singapore at US$2,166/71 a tonne at 0230 GMT against the late close in London on Monday of $2,170/75 a tonne. A Japanese dealer quoted copper at $2,172 a tonne.  </p>
<p>Three month aluminium was priced at 0230 GMT at $1,516/20 a tonne, little changed from London's late close yesterday of $1,516/18 a tonne, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Aluminium will track copper this afternoon. The weakness of the base metal complex stems mainly from copper," one dealer said.</p>
