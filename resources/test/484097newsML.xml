<p>Bulgaria said on Thursday it was prepared to contribute troops to an international security force to protect relief supplies to Albania.</p>
<p>Italy, France, Greece, Turkey, Spain, Romania and Austria have already offered to contribute troops. Any Bulgarian participation would require approval from the new parliament after general elections set for April 19.</p>
<p>"Bulgaria's government declares that Bulgaria is prepared to take part in a suitable form in the international forces which were set up under Resolution 1101 (1997) of the United Nations Security Council," a government statement said.</p>
<p>It said the decision reflected Bulgaria's concern for stability in the Balkan region and its desire for integration in the European Union and NATO.</p>
