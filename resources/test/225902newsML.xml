<headline>French stocks rally to highest close this year.</headline>

<p>The Paris bourse's blue-chip index closed on Friday at its highest level this year after a rally fuelled by European bond market gains, a stronger dollar and signs that a 12-day truckers' strike was winding down.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 index finished up 25.35 points, or 1.11 percent, at 2,315.66. It pulled back from a high of 2,327.81 after the Bank of France poured cold water on growing expectations of a franc depreciation which would have been welcomed by the bourse.</p>
<p>But traders said the market was poised to test its historic high of 2,360.98 points set in February of 1994. "We could test that record next week," one trader said.</p>
<p>"As long as the dollar and bonds are this strong, there's no reason to pull back," he said.</p>
<p>Volume was a huge 10.99 billion francs, swollen by the expiry this afternoon of November Futures and options contracts.</p>
<p>Investors' concerns about widening labour unrest in France eased on Friday as striking truckers dismantled roadblocks after unions reported progress in talks with employers.</p>
<p>But investors came down from the clouds after Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet said in a written statement that the central bank was committed to the stability of the franc and that nothing would justify a depreciation.</p>
<p>Bourse investors would welcome a weaker franc and lower interest rates to give businesses, particularly in the export industries, a little more breathing room.</p>
<p>Traders say the market's underperformers are coming under renewed interest.</p>
<p>Publishing group Havas rose for a second day, closing up 1.01 percent at 370 francs.</p>
<p>Havas, one of the year's worst performers, began to rally on Thursday on a report one of its big shareholders, Alcatel Alsthom, was pushing it to boost shareholder value.</p>
<p>Shares in LVMH finished up 3.6 percent at 1,324 francs on a report in the weekly Nouvel Economiste that it may sell its 20 percent stake in Guinness to eventually finance the purchase of 100 percent of duty free chain DFS. LVMH declined to comment on the report. On Thursday it announced it was also acquiring acclaimed winemaker Chateau d'Yquem.</p>
