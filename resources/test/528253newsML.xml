<p>International Business Machines Corp will report first quarter earnings on Wednesday and like many multi-national companies, the computer giant is expected to be hurt by the stronger dollar outside the U.S.</p>
<p>IBM will again report earnings after the stock market closes, a routine it adopted last quarter, in order to avoid some of the volatility in its stock during its meeting and conference call with analysts, which now begins at 1630 EDT.</p>
<p>According to First Call, the consensus estimate for IBM is $2.28 a share, with a range of estimates from $2.10 to $2.37.  </p>
<p>"They will have a big currency hit and they will probably talk about currency hitting the second quarter," said Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial analyst.</p>
<p>So far, multi-national companies like Digital Equipment Corp, Xerox Corp and other corporations with large overseas operations have reported that the stronger dollar outside the U.S. has had a negative impact on earnings.</p>
<p>When the exchange rate of the dollar versus foreign currency climbs, revenues earned in those foreign currencies are worth less when they are translated back to the U.S.</p>
<p>For IBM, currency may hurt earnings by about $0.20 a share.  </p>
<p>Analysts said that a product transition in mainframes may also hurt mainframe sales, which may experience a greater than normal decline, as some customers have held off buying in anticipation of a new mainframe upgrade, due possibly in June, analysts said.</p>
<p>"I assumed mainframes were relatively weak," said Steve Milunovich, a Morgan Stanley analyst. He said that he is looking for the bright spots in the quarter to be in the personal computer business and in computer services.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, IBM's services revenues surged 22 percent, compared with its overall revenue growth of six percent, including the negative impact from currency.  </p>
<p>"They will talk about services growth," said Helmig. He also said that IBM will likely report strength in North America, weakness in Europe and very strong growth in Asia Pacific, particularly in Japan.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, a rumor began to surface on Wall Street that IBM would pre-announce that it would not meet analysts' estimates for the first quarter. IBM said it does not comment on analysts' forecasts and many analysts discounted the rumor.</p>
<p>But within the range of analysts' estimates, there are some who believe IBM may come in below consensus, such as Daniel Mandresh at Merrill Lynch, who has an estimate of $2.10.  </p>
<p>John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst, on the other hand, believes that IBM will exceed Wall Street estimates, and that they will top the consensus estimate of $2.28 a share.</p>
<p>"I'm still hanging in there," Jones said on Tuesday, when asked if he is still on track with his estimate of $2.35 a share and his somewhat contrarian position. Jones said that while he agrees that the mainframe business is very weak, it is only about five to six percent of total revenues.</p>
<p>He sees additional strength coming from IBM's storage and its original equipment manufacturing (OEM) businesses.</p>
<p>IBM reported $2.48 a share a year ago, excluding charges.</p>
