<p>The Mexican peso closed mixed on Friday after several players decided to buy back dollars they had sold in the morning in order to hedge against possible volatility next week, traders said.</p>
<p>"They sold and went a little short (on dollars) this morning, and all they did later was cover those shorts in the afternoon," a trader said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso closed 0.7 of a centavo firmer at 7.9550/7.9580 per dollar while its 24-hour stablemate closed 0.1 of a centavo weaker, respectively, at 7.9540/7.9560 per dollar.  </p>
<p>The 48-hour contract had earlier firmed one centavo to 7.9520/7.9580 per dollar.</p>
<p>Same-day peso contracts had closed 0.2 of a centavo weaker at 7.9500/7.9520 per dollar.</p>
<p>"It was another quiet day. The U.S. markets are strong, but the peso has not been able to advance further," the trader added.</p>
<p>Dealers said the peso was under some pressure, despite the strength of the U.S. long bond yield, due to the proximity of the end of the first half, the July 2 Federal Open Market Committee meeting and Mexican mid-term elections on July 7.  </p>
<p>"U.S. data released in recent days have been anti-inflationary...there is talk the FOMC will not raise U.S. interest rates in July," another traded said. "Nonetheless, the market feels as if it's under pressure.</p>
<p>"Many dealers do not want to go short (on dollars). If they do, it is just intraday and they square their books before the end of the day," the trader added.</p>
