<p>U.S. drug maker Merck and Co. on Friday announced it was ending a controversial AIDS drug trial in Brazil one year ahead of schedule after tests showed it would be ethically improper to continue.</p>
<p>The study found patients infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, who took the protease inhibitor Indinavir were two-thirds less likely to develop an AIDS-related illness than those using only the anti-viral drug AZT.</p>
<p>One third of the 996 volunteers in the study were treated with AZT without the protease inhibitor, which Merck is marketing under the brand name Crixivan. The others received Crixivan either alone or in combination with other drugs.</p>
<p>Researchers said it would be wrong to continue administering the outdated AZT treatment to one group and maintaining them at a disadvantage to those receiving combination medication. The study was originally scheduled to last three years.</p>
<p>"From the moment we had the evidence that one of the options is better than others ... the best thing was to interrupt the study," Dr David Lewi of the Sao Paulo School of Medicine, one of the doctors conducting the trial, told a news conference. "We are running ethical risks in continuing with a certain group."</p>
<p>Dr Rogerio Pedro of the Faculty of Medical Science at the University of Campinas said the researchers had discovered the AZT treatment was less effective than the two other options on Nov. 30.</p>
<p>AIDS activists welcomed Friday's announcement, saying Merck should have ended the study months ago. "They already had this data back in November. Why are they only ending the trial now?" asked Mario Scheffer of the Grupo Pela Vida (Group For Life).</p>
<p>AIDS groups allege Merck did not meet ethical standards in conducting the study, saying researchers waited too long before changing the treatment for volunteers whose condition was worsening and did not provide them with all the medical facts.</p>
<p>Researchers rejected allegations that Brazil was chosen as a site for the study because it has a high per capita rate of HIV sufferers who at the time did not have access to the latest medication via the public health system.</p>
<p>"At no moment did we offer patients a treatment that was in any way ethically inferior to that in other countries," said Dr Guido Levi, director of the Emilio Ribas Institute in Sao Paulo.</p>
<p>Brazil has one of the world's highest rates of HIV infection, with some 95,000 cases officially registered. But health officials estimate that as many as 450,000 Brazilians could be carrying the HIV virus out of a total population of 160 million.</p>
<p>"At least some of them turned into the guinea pigs of these laboratories," Scheffer said.</p>
<p>Volunteer Luiz Sergio Forster, 31, said that while on the programme he began to suffer from weight loss and chronic diarrhoea but doctors did not change his drug regimen until he contracted a more serious infection six months later.</p>
<p>"My desperation was knowing I was taking medication which wasn't working and couldn't change it," Forster said. "I didn't have access to the right treatment because the design of the study did not allow it."</p>
<p>Protease inhibitors, used in combination with older anti-viral drugs, have transformed AIDS treatment. Though not a cure, these combination therapies have suppressed the virus to undetectable levels in many patients and prolonged their lives.</p>
