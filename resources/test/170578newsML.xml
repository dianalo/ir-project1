<p>Rival sides in divided Cyprus said on Wednesday they expected the re-election of U.S. President Bill Clinton would raise chances of resolving the Mediterranean island's 22-year-old division.</p>
<p>"This is an opportunity for Cyprus," Turkish Cypriot news agency TAK quoted Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash as saying.</p>
<p>On the other side of the divide, Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides said he expected Washington to play a positive role towards a resolution of the Cyprus question during Clinton's second term.</p>
<p>"I do not think we should anticipate the United States to exert pressure on anybody," Clerides told reporters.</p>
<p>Denktash, who heads a self-proclaimed Turkish Cypriot state in northern Cyprus that is recognised only by Turkey, said Clinton would probably not side with Greek Cypriots in the dispute.</p>
<p>"If there is a statesman who can tell the Greek Cypriots, 'You are not the government of the Turks. You are one of the two sides in Cyprus. You cannot ignore the effective and actual guarantee of Turkey,' it is Mr Clinton," Denktash said.</p>
<p>Turkey, which invaded Cyprus in 1974 after a Greek-engineered coup on the island, maintains 30,000 troops in the north.</p>
<p>Peace initiatives by the United Nations, the European Union and the United States, including the Clinton administration, have all failed to bring the island's two communities together.</p>
<p>The United States is due to intensify its efforts in coming months, along with Britain, to achieve a breakthrough on the Cyprus issue which would facilitate a meeting of the leaders of the two sides in early 1997.</p>
