<p>A push for globalization and emphasis on non-aerospace business should help United Technologies Corp. post record earnings on Thursday, analysts said.</p>
<p>"I think we'll see record earnings both for the fourth quarter and for the year," said Wolfgang Demisch, managing director at BT Securities in New York.</p>
<p>According to First Call, which monitors Wall Street analysts' earnings projections, United Technologies' 1996 earnings should be $3.40 per share, compared to $2.85 in 1995.  </p>
<p>First Call estimates 1997 earnings at $3.94.</p>
<p>The industrial-technology giant's earnings for the fourth quarter should be $0.83, a 16.9 percent increase over the year-ago earnings of $0.71, First Call said.</p>
<p>United Technologies' stock on Wednesday dipped 0-7/8 to 66-3/4.</p>
<p>Analysts credited George David, the energetic president and chief executive of United Technologies, with helping wean the company from its aerospace and defense roots and sniffing out expansion opportunities in elevators and air conditioners.  </p>
<p>Among the businesses owned by United Technologies are Otis, the world's biggest producer of elevators; Carrier, the world's biggest producer of heating and air-conditioning systems; Sikorsky, the key player in the world helicopter market; and Pratt &amp; Whitney, one of the world's biggest three jet-engine makers.</p>
<p>United Technologies also owns a mixture of aerospace- and automobile-component makers grouped under the Hamilton Standard and United Technologies Automotive umbrellas.  </p>
<p>"The common thread in United Technologies over the last several years is a recognition that the company has tremendous opportunities not just in aerospace but in the global market for its commercial operations," said Demisch.</p>
<p>Otis, for example, enjoys a market-leading 24 percent of the $24-billion world elevator and escalator market. Some 85 percent of its 1995 revenues of $5.3 billion was generated outside the U.S., Otis officials have said.  </p>
<p>United Technologies "is a company that had a very tough time in the early '90s, with Pratt &amp; Whitney losing significant market share, and not adjusting its costs accordingly," said Michael Bunyaner, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York.</p>
<p>The company has since gotten a better grip on costs, said Bunyaner. "This company has done exceedingly well in managing the business cycle. I don't expect there to be any significant surprises when the earnings come out."  </p>
<p>In all lines of its business, "The management has paid much more attention to its international opportunities, and that seems to be paying off handsomely," said Demisch.</p>
<p>He warned that the aircraft-engine business remained "hugely competitive" and prone to cyclical forces.</p>
<p>But analysts also said Pratt has been very successful in its Boeing 777 engines and that this ensured future market growth.</p>
<p>Pratt currently has 41 percent of the firm-order market for 777 engines, compared to 31 percent for General Electric Co and 28 percent for Rolls-Royce Ltd, Pratt officials have said.</p>
<p>Pratt has said it expects a strengthening market in commercial aerospace through the year 2000, but notes that it has to win competitions in order to take advantage of that.</p>
