<p>Banks in the Baltic state of Latvia have made a good recovery after being hit by one of eastern Europe's worst banking crises in mid-1995 and are hoping to make more progress in 1997, bank officials said.</p>
<p>Bank stability has increased and the market is becoming increasingly international as Western banks and those from neighbouring Estonia enter the market.</p>
<p>"The year 1996 was to a large extent a year when authority returned to the banking system," Igor Graur, president of the country's 10th largest bank, Saules Bank, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"In 1997 we should see an increase in the authority of banks," he added.</p>
<p>The crisis was sparked by the closure of the country's largest bank, Banka Baltiya, which caused a loss of deposits for thousands of people and slowed the whole economy.</p>
<p>Latvia's banking sector, like those in most other former Communist bloc states, exploded after it regained independence from Moscow in 1991. The number of banks peaked at 63 in 1993, in a country of 2.6 million people.</p>
<p>Latvia now has 35 banks, though only 14 are allowed to take deposits and they hold some 80 percent of fixed assets in the banking system.</p>
<p>Michael Bourke, an EU PHARE advisor with the central bank, said Latvia has done a lot to get its banking system into shape and now has one of the toughest regulatory systems.</p>
<p>"In 1996 we did at least 110 examinations on site," he told Reuters. "Every site has been been visited, at least once and sometimes three times."</p>
<p>The central bank has introduced rules requiring banks to produce financial information monthly or quarterly and has strict loan-loss provisioning.</p>
<p>"It is safe to say that the banking system is a lot stronger now," Bourke added. "Now we are not just recovering from bad times but we are starting to grow sensibly," Bourke said.</p>
<p>Bankers said that Latvian banks have left the former easy money times behind them and now want to lend sensibly and increase service to their clients.</p>
<p>They are also being pressured by foreign banks as the largest bank in Estonia, Hansapank, has already entered the market.</p>
<p>Latvia also boasts two foreign banks, Vereinsbank and Societe Generale, which have branches.</p>
<p>Saules Bank's Graur said local banks would probably have to merge to reach a size where they can compete beyond Latvia's borders.</p>
<p>His bank has just struck a deal to sell 20 percent of its shares to Tallinna Pank, the fourth largest bank in Estonia.</p>
<p>Unibanka, one of Latvia's largest banks, is in talks with the eighth biggest bank, Zemes Bank.</p>
<p>But Graur was concerned the central bank's tough rules would prevent the growth of Latvian banks by restricting lending too much at a time when credit was needed for an expanding economy.</p>
