<p>Divergence between French and German growth levels could provide an opportunity for speculators to sell French assets, but political commitment to European Economic and Monetary Union will see them through, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>"If the picture emerges this week of stronger than expected growth in Germany and weaker than expected growth in France, it will attract speculators into selling the franc and then moving on to sell bonds," said Don Smith at HSBC Markets in London.</p>
<p>Analysts saw room for the OAT/Bund spread to widen slightly, indicating investors demanding a higher yield from French bonds than German, but French losses would be limited.</p>
<p>"The franc will be under pressure, and the Bund/OAT spread will widen but the political momentum behind EMU is still there," said Smith, an economist at HSBC.</p>
<p>French GDP data for the second quarter were due for release on Wednesday, while Germany's data were expected on Thursday.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll forecast French Q2 GDP to fall 0.2 percent on the quarter and rise 0.6 percent on the year. German Q2 GDP was expected to show a quarterly rise of 1.2 percent, and a yearly rise of 0.7 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said the markets are particularly sensitive to this data because of concerns about government deficit targets which are aimed at meeting the tough Maastricht criteria for EMU.</p>
<p>"If France shows a fall in the second quarter then it raises the question of whether the government can raise enough (revenue) to cut the deficit," said Steve Major, head of bond research at Credit Lyonnais in Paris.</p>
<p>That will bring to the surface already mooted suggestions that there will have to be some softening of the criteria if monetary union is to go ahead on schedule.</p>
<p>As recently as this weekend, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French president Jaques Chirac said that the convergence criteria would be strictly adhered to, but analysts see that as increasingly unlikely.</p>
<p>"There is going to be some slippage and then some kind of fudge to allow monetary union to go ahead," said Ifty Islam, European bond strategist at Merrill Lynch. "The political will is strong enough to force the issue."</p>
<p>He said most overseas investors had already bailed out of French bonds, and domestic fund managers were starting to lighten their exposure and diversify into other assets.</p>
<p>Major said the recent weakening in the French franc towards 3.43 per mark has not been associated with a sharp move higher in short cash rates, but there was sufficient upward pressure on rates to keep speculators at bay.</p>
<p>Major said even if the franc came under attack, the Bank of France would be unable to raise interest rates to defend the currency.</p>
<p>"A rate rise would kill EMU," he said.</p>
