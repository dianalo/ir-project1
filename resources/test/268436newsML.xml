<p>German Hoechst AG said on Thursday that it would transfer all of its business activities into separate legal units during the next year as part of plan to turn itself into a strategic management holding company.</p>
<p>"As part of the overall concept, the German businesses will be turned into individual companies in the form of a company with limited liability, a GmbH &amp; Co. KG," Hoechst said in a statement.  </p>
<p>As part of its drive to improve shareholder value, Hoechst already announced these plans in principle in November. Hoechst, considered to be the single-most successful German group in pushing through a concept to boost the value of its shareholders, also said it planned to list Hoechst AG shares on the New York bourse next year.</p>
<p>As part of the plan announced today, Hoechst said its real-estate holdings would be transferred to its individual units, all of which would be managed by one administrative centre of which Hoechst AG would still retain full ownership.</p>
<p>The separate units will carry the name InfraServ GmbH &amp; Co KG with the site's name added on. For example the group's main plant in Hoechst, a suburb of Frankfurt, will be known as InfraServ GmbH &amp; Co Hoechst KG.</p>
<p>Hoechst board member Ernst Schadow said the move would ensure that the separate units will be able to run their own businesses but that safety and environmental standards would be coordinated centrally.</p>
