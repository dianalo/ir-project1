<headline>EMU expectations in Spain and UK rise, JP Morgan.</headline>

<p>Market expectations of the UK and Spain taking part in European Monetary Union climbed over the past week while EMU expectations in Italy also rose a notch, JP Morgan's EMU calculator showed.</p>
<p>The U.S. investment house's method of calculating market expectations of EMU taking place monitors bond yield spreads in the swaps market between participating European countries.</p>
<p>The latest calculation shows the probability of the UK participating in EMU rose 4.0 percentage points in the five trading days to Friday but remained low at 38 percent. Spain rose 5.0 points to 62 percent.</p>
<p>Italy rose one point to 62 percent, bang in line with Spain and just one point above Sweden's estimated 61 percent probability of participation - which was unchanged over the five days to Friday.</p>
<p>Denmark was unchanged at 52 percent, the JP Morgan index showed.</p>
<p>According to these calculations, the market still believes in a 100-percent chance of France and Belgium being in EMU and that was unchanged from last week.</p>
<p>The calculator works by assigning a market probability level to each country. This is derived from the actual swap spread, an in-house assumption of what the spread would be if EMU were not a factor and the expected spread after EMU participation, which is zero.</p>
<p>Following is a table of JP Morgan Calculator results for last week -</p>
