<p>Mexican stocks ended mixed  Tuesday, with blue chips advancing, but the broad market was kept down by forecast hikes in domestic interest rates, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Blue chip stocks gained amid a recovery from profit taking Monday and solid gains by the Dow Jones industrial average.</p>
<p>"The market is firm but awaiting the primary auction, and awaiting what happens with the peso," said Gerardo Copca, an analyst with the Finamex brokerage.</p>
<p>The blue-chip IPC index rose 16.62 points, or 0.40 percent, to 4,142.92.</p>
<p>In the broad market, 44 stocks gained, 44 fell and 22 closed unchanged. Trading volume was moderate at 80.5 million shares.</p>
<p>In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average soared 60.77 points to close at 7,539.27.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of nine money market dealers predicted Banco de Mexico would assign bellwether 28-day Cetes, or treasury bonds, at an average of 20.77 percent, up 147 basis points.</p>
<p>"The Dow did not influence the bourse as much as we would have liked, but the fact it gained does help us," Copca added.</p>
<p>Telmex recovered from profit taking Monday, traders said, to gain 2 centavos (less than 1 cent) to 18.64 pesos ($2.34).</p>
<p>The telecommunications stock accounted for 15 percent of all shares traded on the exchange and contributed most to market gains. Telmex American Depository Receipts, meanwhile, ended unchanged at $46.875.</p>
<p>Retailer Cifra also helped drive the market, up 36 centavos (5 cents) to 13.32 pesos ($1.67).</p>
<p>"They hit Cifra hard yesterday, and it recovered, but opinions are still very mixed on what last week's merger agreement with Wal-Mart will mean for the company," a desk trader said.</p>
<p>Dealers noted that Bancomer, one of Mexico's largest financial groups, managed to fend off the potentially adverse effect of the expected Cetes rate increases.</p>
<p>Bancomer B shares ended unchanged at 3.37 pesos (42 cents) after brisk trade. The A series also closed unchanged at 1.87 pesos (23 cents).</p>
<p>Tortilla and corn flour maker Maseca ended near the top of the prominent gainers' list.</p>
<p>Maseca climbed 30 centavos (4 cents) to 7.90 pesos (99 cents) following news of a modified government scheme of price subsidies for tortillas, which are a staple of the traditional Mexican diet.</p>
