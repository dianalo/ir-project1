<p>Eastern Utilities Associates said Wednesday it agreed to sell its plants and power contracts under a settlement with Massachusetts regulators intended to bring competition to the utility industry.</p>
<p>The energy services company said it hired Salomon Brothers Inc as its advisor in connection with the sale of its entire portfolio of electricity-generating assets.  </p>
<p>For sale are Eastern's interest in 12 plants with a book value of about $400 million, as well as rights to purchase power at other plants in New England, an Eastern spokesman said.</p>
<p>"We're going to retain our distribution and transmission assets so we will be left as a company that moves and delivers energy," he said.</p>
<p>Included in the assets for sale are about 1,130 megawatts of owned and contracted fossil, hydroelectric and nuclear generating capacity, the company said.</p>
<p>Plants range from one of the nation's oldest hydroelectric stations, Pawtucket Hydro, to Eastern's power entitlement from one of the country's newest gas-fired power plants, Ocean State Power.</p>
