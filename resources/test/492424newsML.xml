<p>Hong Kong stocks edged to a firmer close on Monday as investors covered short positions following a selloff last week but amid thin volume as caution remained over the outlook for Wall Street and interest rates.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index closed on a gain of 83.25 points, or 0.68 percent, at 12,287.84. Turnover was HK$5.05 billion compared with HK$4.91 billion on Friday.</p>
<p>"It's reached that point where it's better for investors to stop playing the game," said Kent Rossiter, institutional sales manager at Nikko Securities, pointing to the low turnover figures as evidence of the market's apathy.  </p>
<p>Rossiter said the market was becalmed by lack of news to provide direction for investors.</p>
<p>Last month had seen market-moving information, but there was nothing now to focus on until May's U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in May, he said</p>
<p>OSK Asia Securities dealing director Andrew To said Monday's rally had been largely technical, helped by short-covering in HSBC Holdings Plc and blue chip property developers.</p>
<p>If Wall Street fell this week, the Hang Seng Index might test psychological support at 12,000 points, To said, adding that evidence of stability could prompt a rebound to 12,600.  </p>
<p>Salomon Brothers analyst Michael Green said last month's rise in the key U.S. federal funds rate had sparked investor fears of a round of rate rises identical to the last.</p>
<p>"The ordeal of the previous (U.S.) interest rate increase cycle is still so indelible in people's minds," Green said.</p>
<p>But Green said the U.S. economic fundamentals which prompted a round of rate rises from February 1994 were different from U.S. fundamentals in 1997.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index had been up more than 150 points at one point in the morning session, largely on the back of a rise in U.S. stocks, but pared its gains in the afternoon.</p>
