<title>USA: FORECAST-Sterling/dollar to fade in months ahead.</title>
<headline>FORECAST-Sterling/dollar to fade in months ahead.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>The British pound will soon surrender some of its recent sharp gains versus the dollar, according to analysts polled by Reuters.</p>
<p>Despite pushing to a one-year high near $1.59 Wednesday, the pound is due for a modest pullback, which should steadily take the unit toward $1.54 by early next year, the poll shows.</p>
<p>The mean forecast of 15 analysts surveyed shows the sterling/dollar rate easing to $1.5576 in the fourth quarter of 1996 and $1.5402 in the second quarter of 1997.  </p>
<p>The pound has rallied fiercely in recent sessions, primarily against European currencies, which has helped fuel heavy buying of sterling for dollars.</p>
<p>A relatively healthy U.K. economy offers the prospect of higher interest rates there, while the U.K.'s refusal to join a proposed single European currency has prompted jittery investors to switch funds to the pound, analysts noted.</p>
<p>But many foreign exchange professionals expect the current euphoria to fade as the rest of Europe's economies begin to recover.  </p>
<p>Many also noted that the dollar should eventually recover from recent sterling/dollar buying, which they deemed mostly technical.</p>
<p>The poll yielded wide-ranging forecasts, with analysts seeing the pound as high as $1.75 and as low as $1.41 through the end of 1997.</p>
