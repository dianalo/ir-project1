<p>Higher sustained oil prices have pushed the likely payout on Mexico's Par and Discount Brady bonds higher than originally expected, Bear Stearns debt analyst Tulio Vera said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The bonds have a payout, the so-called "value recovery rights," (VRR) tied to the price of oil.</p>
<p>"What we have seen in the last three months are more refined numbers out of the Mexican government, but more importantly, the price of oil internationally has stayed up for longer and at higher levels than was initially envisioned," Vera told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Based on higher than anticipated Mexican oil export volumes and higher prices, Bear Stearns is now expecting a December 31 payment of $201 per million face value for Par bonds and $310 per million of Discount bonds.</p>
<p>"We estimate the corresponding March 31, 1997 payments to amount to approximately $1,211 per million Pars and $1,863 per million Discounts," Bear Stearns said.</p>
<p>The brokerage said the June 30, 1997 payment will also likely be in-the-money, paying $1,852 per million on Pars and $2,849 per million on Discounts.</p>
<p>"Although we are not calculating them at this time, it now appears more probable that the Mexican VRRs will also be in-the-money for the September 30, 1997 payment date," Bear Stearns said.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns said that investors monitoring Mexican VRR payments should focus more on the future evolution of international oil prices than on Mexican export volumes.</p>
