<headline>Argentine stocks power ahead in hefty volume.</headline>

<p>Argentine stocks rallied sharply Tuesday with volume swelling to a four-month high as investors snapped up bellwether YPF.</p>
<p>"YPF soared and led the market higher today in a very upbeat trading environment," said Cristina Hintz of brokers Provincia Bursatil.</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index  .MERV jumped 1.9 percent to 590.11, extending a nine-day rally to 8.4 percent.</p>
<p>But traders sounded a note of caution.</p>
<p>"We may finally be on the brink of topping out," said Jorge Bonnano at Interfin brokers.  </p>
<p>"The mood was euphoric today, and overall prospects are good, but in the short run the more we rise the harder we may fall -- especially because it won't be easy to match this volume," said Bonnano.</p>
<p>Floor turnover surged to 28 million pesos from Monday's dismal tally of 10.8 million, while over-the-counter deals totalled 162.5 million pesos against 110.1 million Monday.</p>
<p>In the session oil giant YPF shot up 3.0 percent to $24.1, its highest close this year, driven by a flurry of foreign buying on the back of a new rise in world crude prices, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Oil company Astra, which recently sold a controlling stake to Spain's Repsol and has an aggresive expansion plan, also surged 4.2 percent. But oil firm Sol Petroleo tumbled 5.1 percent on uncertainty surrounding a planned stock issue, dealers said.</p>
<p>The broad market closed up 1.8 percent, with winners smashing losers 44 to nine and 18 stocks closing flat.</p>
<p>"The market is underpinned by a sharp drop in country risk," said Hintz, noting Argentina's Brady bonds have posted massive gains recently and may retrench slightly while stocks pick up the slack.  </p>
<p>"Fundamentals are all good right now," said the analyst. "(Planned) labor reforms will go down well in the market, whatever their final shape, and international cash flows are strong enough to generally benefit Argentina."</p>
<p>Top main-tier risers included construction stock Polledo and sugar refiner Ledesma, both up 4.0 percent. The only loser apart from Sol Petroleo was carmaker Sevel, off 0.4 percent.</p>
<p>Also in the session two MerVal stock exchange seats were sold each for 605,000 pesos, or 5.2 percent more than fetched in the previous auction October 2.</p>
