<p>The Mauritius rupee strengthened against both the dollar and the pound on Friday, reflecting a combination of overnight international trends and central bank intervention on Wednesday, forex dealers said.</p>
<p>The rupee was fixed at a mean commercial rate of 20.0610 against the dollar from 20.1285 on Wednesday. The rupee traded at a mean of 32.6750 to the pound from 33.4835 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Banks in Mauritius were closed on Thursday because of a public holiday.</p>
<p>Forex dealers said the stronger rupee was the result of a weakening dollar in overnight markets and the central bank on Wednesday selling the currency five cents below the prevailing interbank rate.</p>
<p>"If there was no intervention, the rupee would have appreciated by only three cents against the dollar today (Friday)," one dealer said.</p>
