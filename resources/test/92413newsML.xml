<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Wednesday restated that the government had no plans to introduce a goods and services tax (GST).</p>
<p>"We went to the last election promising there would be no GST and it is just not on," Howard told reporters.</p>
<p>"There is no way in this term of government we would dream about, contemplate or consider a GST," Howard said.</p>
<p>"We said we wouldn't and we meant what we said," he added.  </p>
<p>Howard has not commented on the possibility of a GST if the Liberal-National government wins a second term.</p>
<p>Opposition Leader Kim Beazley has previously said the government was leaving open the option to introduce a GST if it wins a second term of government.</p>
<p>Howard ruled out a GST in the lead-up to the March 2 national election, but has faced increasing pressure from some business and community groups to change his policy.</p>
<p>Former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser said in August the issue of a GST would likely be brought onto the agenda.  </p>
<p>"I think the GST will come back onto the agenda of the government's at some time...the government will have to find ways of funding lots of programmes that no one will really want to cut out," Fraser told the National Press Club on August 15.</p>
<p>Australia's conservative government announced a tough budget for fiscal 1996/97 (July-June), slashing spending by A$3.9 billion and halving the underlying deficit to A$5.3 billion from A$10.6 billion in 1995/96.</p>
