<p>The United Steelworkers of America (USWA) said late on Thursday it was prepared to continue negotiations to end a strike against Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, despite the company announcing it was breaking off talks.</p>
<p>WHX Corp, parent of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Union negotiators will hold a press conference at the DoubleTree hotel at January 17, 1997, at 0830 EST, prior to the anticipated negotiating session at 0900 EST.</p>
<p>The union began its strike against Wheeling-Pittsburgh on October 1, 1996 and WHX expects to report a quarterly loss after the strike stopped production at eight of its plants in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, WHX said on January 7.</p>
