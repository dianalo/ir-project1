<p>Thai Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan said on Monday the government is considering setting up a new 25 billion baht fund for helping Thai industries modernise and compete with those in other countries in the region.</p>
<p>Amnuay told reporters the fund would extend loans to beneficiary industries including textiles, at a concessional 9-10 percent interest rate, to help them streamline production and replace outdated machinery.  </p>
<p>The minister said the Bank of Thailand will contribute about 25 percent of the targeted fund with the remaining resources provided by other government agencies including the Thai Export Import Bank and the Industrial Finance Corp of Thailand.</p>
<p>"Industries obtaining concessional loans must find new machinery with modern technology to compete in the future," he said.</p>
<p>Amnuay said the Thai textile industry, facing growing competition from neighbours with cheaper labour like Vietnam and Burma in recent years, would initially receive about two billion baht in loans from the fund.</p>
