<p>Japanese cosmetics maker Shiseido Co Ltd said on Monday it has formed a joint venture with South Korean partners to start selling Shiseido products in South Korea from September.</p>
<p>Shiseido Korea Co Ltd, capitalised at about 910 million yen, is 60 percent owned by Shiseido and 40 percent by a group of partners including Sung-Whan Suh, chairman of South Korean cosmetics maker Pacific Corp, Shiseido said in a statement.</p>
<p>Through the alliance, Shiseido aims to strengthen its marketing strategy to prepare for intensifying competition in the Korean market, the company said.</p>
<p>Shiseido said that in calendar 1996 the Korean cosmetics market was the largest in Asia after Japan with sales of approximately 380 billion yen based on factory shipments. It said competition among the world's cosmetics makers was expected to intensify in Korea.</p>
<p>Shiseido Korea will aim to post 3.8 billion yen in sales on a wholesale basis by 2000, Shiseido said.</p>
<p>A senior Shiseido official said recently that by 2000 the company expects 40 percent of its sales to come from Asia, excluding Japan.</p>
<p>He said the demand for cosmetics in the Asian market was expected to grow by $1 billion annually.</p>
