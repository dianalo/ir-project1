<p>Italy's Fiat group said it had sold its 1.9 pct stake in Alcatel Alsthom to Societe Generale and that it expected to make a gross capital gain of around 200 billion lire on the sale.  </p>
<p>Fiat said in a statement the group had sold 3,099,759 Alcatel Alsthom shares on Thursday, representing around 1.9 percent of the French company's capital, to Societe Generale bank.</p>
<p>It said the operation, which had been agreed with Alcatel Alsthom, marked Fiat's exit from the firm's capital following the exit by Alcatel from Fiat's capital last year.</p>
<p>The deal, worth around two billion French francs, or some 590 billion lire, "allows the Fiat Group to realise a gross consolidated capital gain of around 200 billion lire," the statement added.  </p>
<p>Earlier in Paris on Thursday, market sources said French brokerage Delahaye, a unit of Societe Generale, was placing three million Alcatel Alsthom shares at 647 francs per share.</p>
<p>The seller was rumoured to be Fiat but a spokeswoman at Fiat France denied the company was selling Alcatel shares.</p>
