<p>Alliant Techsystems Inc said Tuesday as a result of an accounting change, it will record a one-time non-cash charge of $17.4 million or $1.30 per share in the company's fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31, 1997.</p>
<p>It said the non-cash charge represents estimated future costs related primarily to ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance activities at the company's remediation sites.  </p>
<p>Chief financial officer Scott Meyers said Alliant traditionally has expensed these environmental charges annually.</p>
<p>"Prior to the issuance of Statement of Position (SOP) 96-1, these costs were charged to operating income each year as they were incurred," Meyers said in a statement. "The SOP requires that all companies now estimate these costs and establish a reserve for them, as we are doing with this one-time charge. Actual cash payments will continue to be made in the year that costs are incurred."</p>
<p>Alliant, an aerospace and defense company, said it will report fourth quarter and fiscal year results in mid-May.</p>
