<p>German construction group Philipp Holzmann AG, which passed on paying a dividend in 1995, said it would also omit a dividend for 1996, confirming what company officials had been hinting at for some time.</p>
<p>In a short mandatory bourse statement, the group, which made losses of 443 million marks in 1995 following huge write-downs for losses on real estate projects, said its group results were slightly positive last year.</p>
<p>At the parent company, results show the company broke even, Holzmann said, giving no numbers.</p>
<p>"There will be no dividend," the group added.</p>
<p>The group also said that two board members, Juergen Schoenwasser and Gerhard Loegters, would resign.</p>
