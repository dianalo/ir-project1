<p>Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi arrived in the rebel-held Albanian city of Vlore on Sunday for a meeting with his Albanian counterpart Bashkim Fino.</p>
<p>Prodi, whose country is to head a 6,000-strong multinational security mission to Albania, arrived in a helicopter that was escorted by two other heavily armed Italian helicopters.</p>
<p>About two dozen Italian marines were on the ground waiting for Prodi when he landed near a lake about 10 km (six miles) outside the southern port city.</p>
<p>It marked the second time in two weeks that Prodi had visited Albania, where nearly 300 people have been killed and about 700 injured in six weeks of violent unrest.</p>
<p>Advance troops from the multinational force, whose mission is to protect aid convoys, began arriving in Albania on Friday.</p>
<p>Fino, 34, was on hand to greet Prodi after arriving in his own helicopter, escorted by two gunships.</p>
<p>"It is a privilege to have Prime Minister Prodi here in our city," said Albert Shyti, the leader of the national salvation committee, a rebel group that took control of the south during the armed uprising earlier this year.</p>
<p>"I do not think there will be any danger to the Italians here," said Shyti, who was also on hand to welcome Prodi.</p>
<p>Prodi planned to visit Vlore last week, but a new outbreak of violence prompted Fino to urge postponement of the meeting.</p>
<p>The town has been under rebel control since the start of an armed uprising prompted by the collapse of pyramid investment schemes, in which many Albanians lost their life savings.</p>
<p>Prodi had paid a brief visit to Gjirokaster, also in the south, on April 2. He was the first foreign leader to visit Europe's poorest country since its descent into lawlessness and violence.</p>
<p>At that meeting, Prodi expressed his condolences to Fino over the sinking of a refugee ship off Italy on March 28. Tirana says at least 80 people died in the sinking.</p>
<p>Many of the 34 survivors of the boat, which had left from Vlore, accused the Italians of deliberately ramming the vessel, charges the navy denied.</p>
<p>Prodi was warmly welcomed in Vlore, where thousands lined the road leading into town and cheered as he rode by in a motorcade of about 30 cars and armoured vehicles.</p>
<p>Banners reading "Welcome Mr Prodi" along with "We Want Our Money Back" were held up by spectators along the road into town. Several were written in Italian and one banner read: "Down with Berisha mafia", a reference to President Sali Berisha.</p>
<p>An estimated 10,000 people jammed a central town square in front of a university building where Prodi and Fino met local leaders in the rebel stronghold.</p>
<p>Scores of Italian marines stood guard in front of the building, backing up local police officers to prevent people from entering the building.</p>
<p>Prodi and Fino were due to fly to Tirana, about 150 km (90 miles) to the north, later on Sunday.</p>
