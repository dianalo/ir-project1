<p>South Africa's two business newspapers on Thursday called on the government to scrap exchange controls to end the agony in the foreign exchange markets which has been the rand dive to record lows.</p>
<p>"(Finance Minister Trevor) Manuel and (Reserve Bank Governor Chris) Stals cannot delay the complete removal of exchange controls if further damage to the currency and the economy are to be avoided," Business Day said in an editorial.</p>
<p>The country could expect immediate International Monetary Fund (IMF) backing if there were a major outflow of funds, shoring up the rand and helping reinforce investor confidence, the paper said.</p>
<p>The government also needed to speed up progress with privatisation, seen as a litmus test of its commitment to economic reform.</p>
<p>"Failure to act decisively on controls and privatisation will be interpreted as weakness by speculators and investors who will trade the rand down even further until catastrophe forces the controllers' hands," Business Day said.</p>
<p>Business Report said the possible one-off fall in the rand with the scrapping of controls was preferable to continued speculative attacks.</p>
<p>"Obviously, lifting exchange controls would stop the rot by collapsing the rand to a real floor. Surely that has to be preferable to the drip-drip of water torture by speculation."</p>
<p>The rand hit a new record low of 4.7475/25 early on Thursday.</p>
