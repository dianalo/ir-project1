<p>Gold closed slightly firmer on Wednesday after a day of slow, two-way trading despite early Asian short-covering, dealers said.</p>
<p>Trading sources in Hong Kong said sentiment remained bullish after a topsy-turvy week that saw prices fall to their lowest point in three years at just below US$366.50 before clambering back up to Wednesday's close of $369.</p>
<p>Singapore-based traders predicted in the wake of the tumble that gold could fall as far as $360 an ounce, and there were hints of this from Hong Kong dealers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Sentiment is still very bearish but there should be support at $367," a bullion house source said.</p>
<p>"It will come down another dollar or two...but should find support," he said. "If it hits $365, my advice -- dump."</p>
<p>Another slip on Wall Street could see some funds fly from equities into gold, another dealer said.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials skidded 80 points on Tuesday to its biggest point loss since the July stocks sell-off as investors raced to lock in profits after a spectacular November.</p>
<p>The loss of 1.21 percent brought the Dow to 6442.69, a level gold sources in Hong Kong said could signal Wall Street's direction for the rest of 1996.  </p>
<p>Hong Kong bullion ended at US$368.60/369.10 an ounce against New York's US$368.40/90 close on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Gold went back up slightly in Asia on bargain-hunting and short-covering (after New York's close)," a trading house dealer said. "But bearish sentiment continued to cloud the market."</p>
<p>He predicted that, having broken the $367-368 support levels, gold could test a barrier as low as $362.</p>
<p>Local gold ended HK$2 lower at HK$3,408 a tael.</p>
<p>The carryover charge at the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society remained unchanged from Tuesday at +5.00.</p>
