<p>Trading in shares of Kun Young Construction Corp was halted on rumours that it had once again defaulted on its debt payments, the Korea Stock Exchange said on Friday.  </p>
<p>"We're waiting to hear definitely from Kun Young's creditors," said an exchange spokesman.</p>
<p>Kun Young officials refused to comment on the talk, while those at SEOULBANK, Kun Young's primary creditor, were not immediately available.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Kun Young defaulted on 1.26 billion won in promissory notes.</p>
<p>Later in the day it filed for court receivership after SEOULBANK rejected a takeover offer by a consortium led by Dongsung Construction Co. SEOULBANK said it would not offer rescue loans until the court recievership was approved.</p>
