<p>The Bangladesh government and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were locked in a dispute on Wednesday over the alleged forcible repatriation of Burmese Moslem refugees from Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The UNHCR, co-supervisor of the long-running repatriation, said Bangladesh had violated an agreement under which only those willing to go home voluntarily would be sent back.</p>
<p>"But the refugees are being forced to leave...they don't get a chance to say no or yes. They are dragged from their camps and locked out prior to forcible repatriation," the UNHCR representative in the southeast town of Cox's Bazar, Van To Nguyen, told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We have protested such inhuman dealings at the (refugee) camp level and with the government which says the refugees must leave anyway," he said.</p>
<p>But senior Bangladeshi foreign ministry official Aminul Islam said on Wednesday: "The charge is absolutely baseless. We are carrying out the repatriation as per the memorandum of understanding reached with the UNHCR.</p>
<p>"They are basically economic refugees and some elements among the refugee population are trying to resist repatriation in a planned manner..." he told Reuters.</p>
<p>A UNHCR spokeswoman on Tuesday said in Geneva the agency had protested to Bangladesh over "disgraceful" expulsions of refugees back into military-ruled Burma.</p>
<p>Spokeswoman Pam O'Toole told reporters that Bangladesh police on Sunday and on Tuesday had rounded up nearly 400 refugees, including women, children and the sick, and sent them to Burma.</p>
<p>Islam denied the allegation, but said the government was in a hurry to send home some 7,000 refugees, recently cleared by Burmese authorities, by August 15.</p>
<p>Some 250,000 Moslems, known as Rohingyas, crossed into Bangladesh from west Burma's Moslem-majority Arakan province in early 1992 to escape what they said was persecution by Burmese troops and forced labour.</p>
<p>About 229,000 had returned home before the process suddenly stopped on May 1. Repatriations resumed on Sunday after the Burmese authorities cleared the 7,000 refugees, of whom nearly 400 left for home on Sunday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>Violent resistance on Sunday by Rohingyas refusing to go back forced authorities to postpone repatriation from Nayapara camp in Cox's Bazar district.</p>
<p>Some 20 people, including police, were injured in clashes between the camp's inmates and security men. Police arrested six militant Rohingyas.</p>
<p>Bangladesh foreign office officials said the resistance against repatriation was rooted in a recent UNHCR proposal to the government to allow the remaining 21,000 refugees from the 1992 influx to live permanently in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>"The refugees began resisting as soon as the information of the UNHCR proposal was leaked out to the camps. That is the crux of the problem," said one senior official.</p>
<p>"I must say UNHCR itself created the problem. It can't ask any country to settle refugees. It's beyond its mandate," said the official, who declined to be named.</p>
<p>Bangladesh officials say more than 15,000 Rohingyas have arrived in Bangladesh over the past three months in a new influx, triggered by what the refugees said were continuing military persecution and a recent rise in food prices.</p>
