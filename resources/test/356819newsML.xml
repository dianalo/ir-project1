<p>NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said on Wednesday he did not expect Turkey to block the alliance's expansion into Eastern Europe in order gain closer Turkish links with the EU.</p>
<p>"The two decisions are independent," he told reporters during a stopover in Hungary. "I do not think (a Turkish veto) is going to take place.</p>
<p>"Everybody has agreed to have the summit in July when decisions about the internal adaptation of the alliance, opening the alliance to new members, and decisions about our relationship with Russia will be taken," Solana added.</p>
<p>Solana, on his way to Turkey for a two-day official visit, held talks at Budapest airport with Hungarian Defence Minister Gyorgy Keleti.</p>
<p>Hungary generally is considered to be among the frontrunners for early integration into NATO when the military alliance expands.</p>
<p>Solana was flying to Ankara for a two-day official visit to Turkey in a fresh attempt to reduce tensions with fellow NATO member Greece in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>NATO officials fear the continuing crisis in relations between two key members on its strategic southern flank could spill over into plans to reform the alliance and take in new members from former communist east Europe.</p>
<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, also deputy prime minister in the Islamist-led government, has warned the West that Ankara could veto NATO's eastward expansion plans if its aspirations for closer ties with the European Union remain frustrated.</p>
