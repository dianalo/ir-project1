<p>France's Socialist-led opposition scored a stunning parliamentary election triumph in Sunday's decisive second-round runoff, forcing President Jacques Chirac to share power with a hostile left-wing government.</p>
<p>Socialist Party leader Lionel Jospin, likely to be asked to form a government on Monday, said the people had voted for a change of direction in European policy. But he did not call into question the planned single European currency.</p>
<p>Computer projections gave the Socialists and their non-communist allies, including the Greens, between 287 and 296 seats in the 577-member National Assembly. This means that, to govern, they may need the support of the Communist Party, forecast to win 35-36 seats.</p>
<p>Just 40 minutes after polling stations closed, conservative Prime Minister Alain Juppe went on television to concede defeat.</p>
<p>"The people have spoken. Their decision is sovereign. We all respect it. I wish those who will now govern France good luck and I wish France good luck," the outgoing premier said.</p>
<p>"We did not manage to convince the French people that we were going in the right direction," he said in a statement in his Bordeaux constituency.</p>
<p>The result was a crushing defeat for Chirac's centre-right coalition, which was projected to lose almost half the 464 seats it held in the outgoing lower house.</p>
<p>The president, who dissolved the assembly on April 21 saying he needed a "new elan" to lead France into a single European currency from a position of strength, seemed bound to call on Jospin to form a government.</p>
<p>It will be the third time in 11 years that France has had a period of left-right power-sharing known as "cohabitation".</p>
<p>The ecologist Greens were set to enter parliament for the first time with eight or nine seats. The extreme-right National Front, despite polling 15 percent in last Sunday's first round, won just one seat.</p>
<p>National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said Chirac had suffered a double defeat and should resign.</p>
<p>Jospin has said he supports European economic and monetary union but would not impose a further bout of austerity to meet the strict criteria to qualify for the single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>In a victory statement in his constituency of Cintegabelle, near Toulouse, he said the result was "a demand for justice, a demand for a profound renewal of our public life and democracy, a demand for an economic and social policy put at the service of man, a demand for a reorientation of European construction -- which we favour -- and a demand for a scupulous attention to the problems French people meet in their daily lives."</p>
<p>Jospin has said he will seek new EU negotiations on giving greater priority to employment and economic growth, on including Italy, Spain and Portugal in the single currency from the start and on ensuring the euro was not overvalued against the dollar.</p>
<p>In Brussels, European Commission President Jacques Santer said he expected no change in the timetable or terms for the single currency. EU Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert said: "It seems to be a large majority that will be in favour of the euro. I don't think this is going to change anything as far as the euro is concerned."</p>
<p>Communist leader Robert Hue, declaring "a great hope is born", said his party hoped to join "a government of the whole left" on the basis of a joint policy declaration issued with the Socialists in April, which did not mention the single currency.</p>
<p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the Socialists' likely finance minister, said the right had lost because of unemployment.</p>
<p>"In 1993, the French people told the Socialists they didn't want them any more I think because we hadn't succeeded on unemployment. The majority in place since then has not succeeded either and above all it has created enormous poverty," he said.</p>
<p>The Socialists have pledged to create 700,000 jobs for young people, half of them in the public sector, over the next three years, and reduce the working week from 39 hours to 35 over five years without loss of pay.</p>
<p>Hundreds of cheering Socialist supporters gatecrashed the movement's victory party at a Paris cultural centre, overwhelming guards who had orders to admit only 2,000 invited guests and journalists.</p>
<p>Riot police were called in when extreme-leftists and groups representing homeless tried to force their way in, causing brief scuffles in the street.</p>
<p>Inside the building, rhythmic chants of "On a gagne, on a gagne" (We won, we won) greeted the announcement of the sensational election result on giant television screens.</p>
<p>At the centre-right's campaign headquarters, there was stunned silence from the ranks of grim-faced activists.</p>
<p>The computer projections gave the combined left between 325 and 334 seats, well over the 289 seats required for a majority.</p>
<p>The right's debacle was amplified from last Sunday's first round despite an increase in turnout to 72 percent, from 68 percent on May 25.</p>
