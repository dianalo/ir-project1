<p>Danish banks are expected to post record first-half 1997 results, thanks to a buoyant economy which has helped take the sting out of bad debt provisions. But higher profits may not be enough to send bank shares above current levels, analysts said.</p>
<p>"We will see falling losses and bad debt provisions in many banks' interim reports and that could mean better overall results than last year for many of them," analyst Hans Kjaer at Dansk Aktie Analyse research institute told Reuters.</p>
<p>Many analysts considered 1996 a record year for Danish banks when loss and bad debt provisions fell 33 percent in the sector to a total of 3.681 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Recent upbeat forecasts for the first-half of 1997 defy previous general predictions in the bank industry that loss and bad debt provisions could not fall further.</p>
<p>Analysts said the rosy profits picture largely reflected Denmark's solid economic upswing, which enabled banks to set less aside to cover losses and bad debt.</p>
<p>"There has been a tendency to over-budget for losses and bad debt with excessive funds not needed ending up as income. This means that net loss and debt provisions will be exceptionally low," said another analyst, who wished to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>With many world stock markets near record highs, earnings from securities business are expected to enhance banking coffers but despite the positive outlook, some analysts warn bank shares are overpriced.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that the interim bank results are going to be good this year, but banks' core earnings are still going to remain under great pressure," another analyst said.</p>
<p>"This means that the current price of leading Danish bank shares is ridiculously high as it does not reflect their actual core earnings," he said.</p>
<p>Shares in Denmark's two biggest banks Den Danske Bank and Unidanmark, due to report later this month, have risen by 57 percent and 38 percent respectively this year alone, closing Friday at 735 and 419 crowns.</p>
