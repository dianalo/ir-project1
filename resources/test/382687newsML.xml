<p>Traded volume on the Istanbul gold exchange surged to 1,674 kg on Monday from Friday's 419 kg, with banks engaging in arbitrage and fresh physical demand emerging after the recent holiday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gold closed up at $345.90 an ounce and 1,343,800 lira per gram, versus $343.90 and 1,326,400 lira on Friday.</p>
<p>"Some 500 kg of the trade was due to the banks making arbitrage deals to benefit from the exchange rates, but there was also good physical demand continuing after last week's public holiday," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The Turkish lira eased to 120,810 lira to the dollar from 119,840 on Friday. Dealers said the lira's weakness enabled banks to conduct arbitrage trade.</p>
<p>The four-day religious holiday which finished last Wednesday encouraged gold jewellery sales last week.</p>
<p>Most of the day's trade -- 82.1 percent -- was conducted in lira terms.</p>
