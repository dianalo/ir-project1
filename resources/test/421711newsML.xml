<headline>Israeli shekel weakens against dollar.</headline>

<p>The Israeli shekel representative rate was fixed slightly lower against the dollar on Wednesday in very quiet trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Nothing happened today and the shekel closed only slighty lower against the dollar," said a dealer at Bank Hapoalim. "Activity was very low and the only player in the market was the Bank of Israel who had to intervene in the market to support the basket."</p>
<p>The dealer said the central bank intervened on a relatively small scale.</p>
<p>The central bank has been intervening regularly to defend the currency basket rate, which has been trading at the bottom end of its band for nearly two months.</p>
<p>The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.3670 shekels against 3.3630 on Tuesday. The basket, composed of the dollar, mark, pound sterling, French franc and yen, was fixed at 3.6466 shekels against 3.6454 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On the crosses the shekel traded against the yen at 2.7731 shekels per 100 yen against 2.7606 on Tuesday and against the mark at 1.9650 shekels against 1.9681 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In late afternoon the dollar was trading at 3.3630 shekels.</p>
