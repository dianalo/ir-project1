<p>Swedish state-owned company Securum said on Friday it would list its property unit Castellum, which has a portfolio worth around 8.0 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Securum said it had broken off talks on selling Castellum to Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund II, L-P (MSREF).  </p>
<p>Securum said it reached agreement in principle earlier this year regarding the sale of Castellum to the U.S. investment bank.</p>
<p>"During the course of the discussions with MSREF, however, the market for properties and shares of real estate companies improved continuously. It became increasingly apparent that the idea of cooperation was an unnecessary intermediate stage. Instead, a direct flotation of Castellum became a more natural option," Securum said.</p>
<p>Castellum's operations focus on the long-term management of Swedish property in Stockholm, Gothenburg and the regions of Oresund and Smaland. The real estate portfolio consists of around two million square metres of floor space.</p>
<p>Securum said it commissioned Alfred Berg Fondkommission, D. Carnegie AB and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. to initiate work in preparation for a listing of Castellum shares during the spring of 1997. -- Simon Haydon, Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700-1004</p>
