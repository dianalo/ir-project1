<p>Mark Ramprakash has been recalled by England for the the final Ashes test against Australia beginning at The Oval on Thursday.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old Middlesex captain replaces Lancashire's John Crawley for the sixth test, Australia having already retained the Ashes.</p>
<p>Ramprakash has not played for England for almost two years but the selectors turned to him again on Sunday following his fine championship form over the summer.</p>
<p>He has scored just 533 runs at an average if 16.65 in 19 tests but is still rated one of the biggest talents in the English game.</p>
<p>Pace bowler Darren Gough failed to convince the selectors that he would have recovered in time from the knee injury which he aggravated in the fourth test at Headingley.</p>
<p>Surrey opener Mark Butcher has also been recalled after missing just one test and Lancashire seamer Peter Martin makes the squad as cover for Dean Headley who has a bruised heel.</p>
<p>Squad:</p>
<p>Mike Atherton (Captain), Mark Butcher, Andrew Caddick, Robert Croft, Dean Headley, Ben Hollioake, Adam Hollioake, Nasser Hussain, Devon Malcolm, Peter Martin, Mark Ramprakash, Alec Stewart, Graham Thorpe, Phil Tufnell.</p>
