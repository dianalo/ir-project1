<p>Private capital flows to developing countries in Asia were likely to grow but the region's financial markets needed more depth to contain the volatility of those funds, a World Bank official said.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt in our view that capital flows to developing countries will go up further," Amar Bhattacharya, economic adviser at the World Bank, told reporters on Saturday.</p>
<p>"In the developing countries, you can earn a higher rate of return than in industrialised countries. They are growing at double the rate of developed countries," Bhattacharya said.</p>
<p>He was speaking at the end of a two-day conference on the Indonesian island of Bali on private capital flows and implications for capital markets in Asia.</p>
<p>He said the conference focused on the volatility of capital flows to the region, but no resolutions were passed.</p>
<p>"If you look at the United States and Europe, the markets are highly correlated. But the correlation between Asia and the United States is less. I can get considerable portfolio diversification gains by investing in emerging markets," Bhattacharya said.</p>
<p>He also said the ageing population in developed countries had added to pressure for pension reform, which would lead to increased exposure for pension funds in emerging markets because of the higher returns available.</p>
<p>Currently, pension funds in the U.S. had less than two percent exposure to emerging markets, he said.</p>
<p>But portfolio investments could pose considerable danger to developing economies because they could flow out as easily as flowing in, Bhattacharya said. However, volatility was a normal market phenomenon associated with portfolio investments, he said.</p>
<p>He said there were measures to address volatility and also on how to contain risks when funds swung very quickly.</p>
<p>"If governments have to perform the role as financier of last resort, it needs more cushion. You need integrated financial markets," he said.</p>
<p>Bhattacharya said governments needed to develop a domestic investor base because no economy could be sustained only on foreign private capital.</p>
<p>He said governments should undertake pension reform, develop institutional investors and persuade small investors to look at the stock market as a long-term investment.</p>
<p>"Particularly in developing countries in Asia, the populations are young. Equity investments will offer in the long run higher returns than fixed income," Bhattacharya said.</p>
