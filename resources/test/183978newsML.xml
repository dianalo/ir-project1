<p>Greenpeace activists chained themselves to the entrance gate of soybean crushing firm Oelmuehle Hamburg (Oelag) on Tuesday in a protest against the company's decision to use U.S. soybeans which may include genetically modified beans.</p>
<p>An eye witness said activists were trying to block the despatch of soybean oil and soybean meal to customers.</p>
<p>Oelag last week received the first known shipment of U.S. soybeans from this year's crop in Germany, where opposition to genetically modified beans is most acute.</p>
<p>It is quite likely that the cargo contained the new beans which make up one or two percent of the total U.S. crop. The beans are mixed in with ordinary soybeans when they come off the farm in the United States.</p>
<p>Greenpeace says the new beans, developed by Monsanto to resist a widely-used weedkiller, are a risky experiment with nature and could harm human health.</p>
<p>Oelag management said it would not yet comment on the action which had only just begun.</p>
<p>Greenpeace campaign co-ordinator Michael Kuehn said from his office "We want Oelag to try and procure beans free of genetic modification and to process only those."</p>
<p>"It's their duty to be upfront about their actions and not to delude the customer."</p>
<p>Some 35 activists were involved, he said.</p>
