<title>MEXICO: Stocks rebound to 4th straight record.</title>
<headline>Stocks rebound to 4th straight record.</headline>

<p>Mexican stocks recovered from an early bout of profit-taking to chalk up their fourth straight record Thursday after bargain-hunters stepped into the market in late trading.</p>
<p>"Such selling as there was withered away. Once profit-taking had taken prices down, buyers came back from the sidelines," one analyst said.</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index rose 20.37 points to 3,578.34. Volume was moderate at 84.1 million shares. Despite the record close, the broad market was mixed. Of a total of 102 stocks traded, losers outnumbered gainers by 44 to 41.</p>
<p>Some dealers said demand for stocks was fuelled by foreign investors taking positions ahead of the weekend and brokers picking up some stocks at bargain prices.</p>
<p>"After many blue chips had soared to resistance, investors turned to less marketable and bargain stocks, such as Camesa," a floor trader said.</p>
<p>Industrial group Camesa ended up 15 centavos ($0.02) at 3.61 pesos ($0.46).</p>
<p>Other dealers noted that sharp gains on Wall Street -- 1.16 percent to a record 6,625.67 on the Dow Jones industrial average -- also bolstered stocks in Mexico.</p>
<p>Analysts felt Mexico's market still had upside potential.</p>
<p>"The market has woken up with a vengeance, and is still sending buying signals," the technical analyst said. "Any corrections will only be to consolidate the upward trend towards 3,600 points."</p>
<p>Debt-stricken holding company Sidek headed the gainers, up ten centavos ($0.01) to 90 centavos ($11.48), but after a minimal last-minute cross trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>Financial group Serfin followed Sidek, up 33 centavos ($0.04) to 3.13 pesos ($0.40), after what analysts said was a technical breakthrough at 2.90 pesos ($0.37).</p>
<p>Another gainer, steelmaker Ahmsa gained 88 centavos ($0.11) to 16.50 pesos ($2.10) in the wake of a long-term buy reccommendation from the Merrill Lynch brokerage, traders said.</p>
<p>Bus and truck manufacturer, Dina, followed Iasasa, after falling 25 centavos ($0.03) to 4.20 pesos ($0.54) after what traders said was a volatile session for its foreign shares on Wall Street, which ended off 1/8 at 2-1/4.</p>
