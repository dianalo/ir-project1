<p>There will be no ceasefire in Zaire's civil war, no suspension of hostilities and no talk of powersharing until President Mobutu Sese Seko relinquishes power without preconditions, rebel foreign minister Bizima Karaha said on Friday.</p>
<p>"We don't want any suspension of hostilities. We want the end of the war and that can only come about if the man who brought the war is kicked out. When Mobutu leaves, that will be the end of the war," he told a news conference.  </p>
<p>Karaha said speculation that negotiations in South Africa would deal with some form of transitional powersharing was incorrect.</p>
<p>"What we are negotiating is the mode of departure of Mobutu...the modalities for the end of the dictatorial regime," he said."</p>
<p>He said it would be a "cost effective option" if Mobutu agreed to go and thereby save lives in the capital Kinshasa.</p>
<p>Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila ruled out protracted talks with Mobutu earlier on Friday, and said his forces would march on Kinshasa if Mobutu declined to give up power.</p>
