<p>Shenzhen's B share index closed slightly lower on Wednesday as some impatient Chinese investors trimmed their B share holdings to purchase selected A shares that are performing strongly, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B share index shed 0.43 points, or 0.48 percent, to close at 89.49 on turnover of HK$20.14 million, compared with HK$24.33 million on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Brokers said some Chinese investors with B share holdings had become increasingly impatient about being stuck in the stagnant B share market and were diverting funds into buying strong A share companies.  </p>
<p>B share sentiment has turned weak and more Chinese investors' funds are likely to flow to the A share market in the coming sessions, one analyst said.</p>
<p>But overseas institutions were seen buying a handful of large-cap issues with good earnings outlooks, which limited the index's loss, he said.</p>
<p>Chiwan Wharf was the day's biggest loser on speculative selling, brokers said. The counter slumped HK$0.29, or 7.63 percent, to HK$3.51, with 22,000 shares traded.</p>
<p>China Bicycle followed suit, skidding HK$0.12, or 6.15 percent, to HK$1.83.  </p>
<p>Dadonghai, which listed 80 million B shares in Shenzhen on Tuesday, lost HK$0.01 to HK$1.27 on the session's most active trade of 1.70 million shares. The B shares were offered recently at HK$1.22 per share.</p>
<p>Tellus Machinery, Tuesday's biggest loser, rallied HK$0.15, or 10.34 percent, to HK$1.60 on volume of 13,100 shares on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Supported by institutional demand, Guangdong Power charged ahead HK$0.02 to HK$5.40 after 1.37 million shares changed hands, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Diesel engine maker Changchai was the third most actively traded issue and put on HK$0.05 to HK$5.06 on volume of 660,800 shares.</p>
<p>The A share market fell on a technical correction, brokers said. The A share index dipped 5.90 points, or 1.92 percent, to close at 301.43 on massive turnover of 10.47 billion yuan, compared with Tuesday's 9.85 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The composite index edged down 5.31 points, or 1.84 percent, to finish at 283.25.  </p>
<p>Shenyang Fangtian was the target of profit-taking after the Shenzhen-based Securities Times quoted a company spokesman as denying rumours that Fangtian would reap substantial profits from the sale of a property project this year.</p>
<p>The counter slid 0.80 yuan, or 8.60 percent, to 8.50 yuan on heavy trade of 16.87 million shares.</p>
