<p>South Korea on Thursday gave permission for a leading pharmaceutical company to send officials to North Korea to discuss a plan to invest in the communist state, a leading South Korean newspaper reported.</p>
<p>The Friday edition of the Dong-A Ilbo seen late on Thursday reported the unification ministry gave permission for Korea Green Cross Corp to send three officials to North Korea.</p>
<p>Korea Green Cross plans to invest $3 million in a joint venture with a North Korean firm to produce a thrombosis cure, the newspaper said.  </p>
<p>Officials at the unification ministry and the company were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The approval came less than a week after Taechang Co was given the go-ahead to invest $5.8 million in a project to bottle mineral water in North Korea.</p>
<p>Along with Taechang, four other companies including LG Electronics Inc and Hanwha Corp were also given approval last Friday to do business in the North.</p>
<p>South and North Korea have been technically at war since their 1950-53 war ended in a truce.</p>
