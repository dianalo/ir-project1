<p>A common form of blindness that accompanies advancing age can be successfully treated with radiation, a U.S. researcher said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"With radiation therapy we can stabilise or improve vision in people who would otherwise progress to blindness," said Luther Brady of Allegheny University for Health Sciences in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Currently laser therapy is the most common way to treat the condition, in which the macula or centre portion of the retina degenerates with age, leaving victims legally blind with only peripheral vision.</p>
<p>Brady said his technique is valuable for people who suffer from a form of macular degeneration in which there is a proliferation of tiny blood vessels beneath the retina. That particular condition often leads to blindness.</p>
<p>In one pilot study at the University of Louisville Hospitals, 16 patients aged 70 or more with the condition were exposed to low-dose external beam radiation. Of the group, 71 percent remained stable or improved in ensuing months.</p>
<p>In a second test at Hahnemann University in Philadelphia the technique was used on 250 patients, of whom 65 percent remained stable and 25 percent experienced improved vision.</p>
<p>Mark Hartmann of the University of Louisville said the radiation therapy may have an advantage over laser treatment because the latter can destroy the retina's rods and cones, the eyes' photoreceptors.</p>
<p>The report was released at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago.</p>
