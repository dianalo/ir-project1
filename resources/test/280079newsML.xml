<p>Major European stock markets moved ahead on Monday, with London scaling a new peak, while Wall Street, following up a record close on Friday, made a little more progress in early New York business.</p>
<p>Strength in the dollar -- good news for German exporters -- helped boost the Frankfurt bourse by almost 1.3 percent on its final session of 1996 to score a gain for the year as a whole of just over 28 percent. French shares also moved ahead.</p>
<p>On the currency markets, the dollar was in good form but traded below a 45-month peak of 116.20 yen touched in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>Freezing winter weather, meanwhile, sent oil prices surging. London February futures for market benchmark North Sea Brent Blend crude jumped 55 cents to a high of $23.97 a barrel before edging back to $23.84 in mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>On Wall Street the 30-share Dow Jones industrial average gained a further nine points in the first half hour of business to add to Friday's 14.23-point rise to a record 6,560.91 finish.</p>
<p>Dealers said weekend news of two big mergers produced the spark to ignite further gains. U.S. utilities Brooklyn Union Gas Co and Long Island Lighting Co agreed a $4 billion merger, while Dutch insurer Aegon agreed to buy the insurance activities of Providian Corp of the U.S. in a deal worth $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>Wall Street's buoyancy, together with higher futures and bonds and takeover speculation, also helped the London stock market, Europe's busiest, move up into uncharted territory.</p>
<p>Speculation that British Aerospace would merge with another aerospace or defence group resurfaced. BAe shares gained 37.5 pence to 12.63 pounds after an all-time high at 12.74 earlier. Shares in retailers also gained as investors hoped stores would report bumper sales for Christmas.</p>
<p>But share traders said volume on both sides of the Atlantic was expected to remain thin with the New Year holiday in mid- week.</p>
<p>A late surge took the Frankfurt bourse to within 22 points of its record closing level. French shares also took their cue for a rise from Wall Street, a stronger franc and higher bonds but trading was quiet.</p>
<p>But while many other major stock markets have hit new highs in 1996, Tokyo ended its final trading day of the year at just half its record level of seven years ago.</p>
<p>The Nikkei average closed at 19,361.35, down 7.69 points on the day and around 500 below its 1995 close.</p>
<p>Concern about the weakness of the Japanese economy and its sagging stocks put more pressure on the yen, with movements exaggerated by the thin end-of-year markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Markets are thin. What will happen is anyone's guess but dollar-yen looks set to carry on going strong," said a trader at one British bank.</p>
<p>For traders and investors seeking clues on the strength of the U.S. economy, November leading indicators, up 0.1 percent and in line with market forecasts, provided little surprise.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1500 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 1.5575 marks and 115.90 yen, compared with Friday's late European rates of 1.5556 and 115.60.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1500 GMT</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 13.9 points at 4,104.9 after earlier hitting a record 4,111.1. It ended 1995 at what was then a record close of 3,689.3.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt the 30-share DAX index closed floor trade at 2,888.69 points, up 35.81 points or 1.26 percent and only just over 20 points below its record closing level. It eased a little to end later electronic trade at 2,880.07.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was up 11.35 at 2,318.40. It closed last year at 1,980.68.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $369.25 an ounce in the afternoon after a morning setting of $369.60 and Friday's London close of $369.55. Silver dropped nine cents to $4.82 amid pressure from New York-led fund selling.</p>
