<p>President Bill Clinton said on Sunday President Boris Yeltsin was in control in the Kremlin although he obviously had health problems.</p>
<p>"He is clearly in charge," Clinton said in an interview with CNN television during a four-day whistle-stop train journey to the Democratic Party convention in  Chicago.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's health has been of concern in the West since he disappeared from view before the July Russian presidential election. He been seen in public only a few times since, on each occasion looking slow and hesitant in his movements.</p>
<p>Last week, confusion over policy on the war in Chechnya raised questions about who was in charge in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>"We all know that he was exhausted after the (presidential) campaign, that he's had some health problems. But I want to assure everybody that's what they are -- health problems," Clinton said.</p>
<p>"What we all want for President Yeltsin is to get the rest he needs, get the medical treatment he needs...", Clinton said. But he added: "There's no question he's making the big decisions."</p>
<p>Asked whether he believed Yeltsin should come to the United States or another country outside Russia for treatment, Clinton said: "I think that's entirely up to him and his doctors. They can make that decision."</p>
