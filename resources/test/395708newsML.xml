<p>China's hawks and doves -- ultra-leftists and dissidents -- had little to mourn on Friday after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>When Taiwan's President Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, an opposition politician set off firecrackers to celebrate the end of a political dynasty that had ruled the island with an iron fist for almost four decades.</p>
<p>China's jailed and persecuted dissidents and their relatives might also be in a mood to rejoice at the death on Wednesday of Deng, aged 92, after an 18-year rule in which his toughest line was against political dissent.</p>
<p>But security authorities would make sure they had little chance to set off firecrackers, and the judiciary called for law enforcement and social stability.</p>
<p>The mourning of ultra-leftist disciples of Mao Zedong, left out in the cold when Deng set the people free from Stalinist planning and coined the phrase "to get rich is glorious", was likely to be muted.</p>
<p>The atmosphere might also be closer to festive in the home of former Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, his career demolished by Deng, who purged him for sympathising with the 1989 student demonstrations for more democracy.</p>
<p>China has declared six days of mourning for Deng, but he was not without enemies and influential critics.</p>
<p>"I think June 4 will not be forgotten," said a relative of Wang Dan, jailed as a leader of the 1989 demonstrations that were crushed when Deng sent in the army on June 4, 1989.</p>
<p>Deng never wavered from a belief in the supremacy of the Communist Party, purging two previous anointed successors for liberal leanings and ordering the army to quell the protests.</p>
<p>"From a historical perspective, I think it cannot be forgiven," the relative said of Deng's decision.</p>
<p>Wang, 27, was sentenced last October to 11 years in prison for plotting to subvert the government. He had already served four years for his role in the 1989 demonstrations.</p>
<p>China's stability-obsessed leadership has virtually silenced the dissident community, with political activists either jailed, under house arrest or living in exile abroad.</p>
<p>For dissidents, the firecrackers could come a lot later with the advent of freedom and democracy.</p>
<p>"I think now is not the time to set off firecrackers," Wang Dan's relative said by telephone.</p>
<p>"Setting off firecrackers will have to wait... until there is democracy and the situation loosens," he said. "I believe that day will come. Then, I think we can all celebrate."</p>
<p>The wait could be a long one.</p>
<p>"Multi-party politics is within sight but beyond reach," said dissident Ren Wanding, who has been under tight police surveillance since he was released from prison in May after serving seven years for his role in the 1989 demonstrations.</p>
<p>Dissidents and their families crave political rehabilitation of the 1989 demonstrations -- branded by the authorities as counter-revolutionary, or subversive.</p>
<p>"(But) it is not achievable in practice," Ren said. "We can hope for it but cannot be hasty about it."</p>
<p>Ultra-leftists are grinning because the man who dumped most of what chairman Mao Zedong stood for is dead at last.</p>
<p>"Chinese do not love Deng Xiaoping like they love Mao Zedong but they also do not hate Deng Xiaoping like they hate Mao Zedong," one Chinese analyst said.</p>
