<p>Singapore has revised its forecast of 1996 gross domestic product (GDP) growth down to about six percent, and the city state registered annual growth of 3.2 percent in the third quarter, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) had previously forecast 1996 growth at between seven to eight percent, and in the first and second quarters the economy grew at annual rates of 11.4 percent and 7.5 percent respectively, according to revised figures released by Lee.</p>
<p>Lee was speaking at a trade awards ceremony.  </p>
<p>Lee said MTI expects 1997 growth of between five to seven percent, assuming the key electronics industry picks up in second half 1997, as the industry consensus forecasts.</p>
<p>A recent Reuters poll of 11 economists had found their forecasts averaging 6.4 percent growth for 1996 GDP. Most expected growth in the third quarter to average slightly over 3.0 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Export-driven Singapore has been hit by a worldwide slowdown in the critical electronic sector, which accounts for 44 percent of value added in Singapore manufacturing.  </p>
<p>"A major reason for this downturn is the weak performance of manufacturing, particularly the electronics industry and related supporting industries," Lee said.</p>
<p>He said several other manufacturing industries are also weak, including ship-repair, printing, petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Lee said the MTI assessed the current slowdown as cyclical rather than secular. "It reflects a cyclical slowdown in external demand, rather than structural problems in the Singapore economy."  </p>
<p>He said: "Externally, there are also positive signs that the current slowdown will not be too severe or prolonged," citing expected growth in the United States, Japan and China and an industry consensus the electronics slowdown has hit bottom.</p>
<p>Given that assessment, Lee said there was no need for drastic policy adjustments, although the situation should be monitored.</p>
<p>"Meanwhile we should maintain an even course, and accept slower growth for a few quarters until external demand picks up again," Lee said.  </p>
<p>"The current slowdown has not changed our longer term assessment -- that Asia is set to boom for the next 20 years, that we are well placed to take advantage of this regional prosperity, and that we can aim to grow by 6-8 percent per year over the next decade," Lee said.</p>
