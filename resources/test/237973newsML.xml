<p>British automotive design company Hawtal Whiting Holdings Plc said on Thursday it feared a combination of strong sterling, delays to new programmes and a rush of recent quotation activity would mean only a small contribution to the year's results in the second half.</p>
<p>"The recent strengthening of sterling in world markets together with a continuation of our U.S. operation's poor performance, delays to new programmes and an unexpectedly high level of quotation activity in recent months have combined to adversely affect our expectations for the year ending December 31, 1996," the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Accordingly, we believe that the second half will only produce a small contribution to the year's results".</p>
<p>The company said its quotation process was becoming "significantly more comprehensive, time-consuming and costly", but said the benefits "of better programme control which flows from this will more than offset the initial on-cost".</p>
<p>The statement put pressure on the company's share price which was indicated down 31-1/2 pence after its statement at 102-1/2 pence, compared with its Wednesday close of 134 pence.</p>
