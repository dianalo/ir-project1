<p>Latvia and Estonia signed an agreement on Friday allowing the registration of each country's shares at their two central depositories.</p>
<p>Officials told a news conference that the move was the first step to forming a joint Baltic securities market.</p>
<p>"We have to move towards creating a single Baltic equity market, of which this agreement is the first step," said Martti Kuldma, chairman of Estonia's central depository.</p>
<p>"This agreement is necessary for the normal development of the equity market," Martinsh Rikshis, head of Latvia's central depository, said.</p>
<p>Rikshis said that the Lithuanian depository was expected to sign a similar agreement before the end of this year.</p>
<p>"The three countries would be accessible for an investor as a single market," Rikshis added.</p>
<p>"The agreement will provide more possibilities for both investors and issuers. Latvian investors will be able to keep Estonian equities in an account in Latvia and the market will grow in size," he added.</p>
<p>Estonia's market is the newest in the Baltic states, having opened last year. Latvia's started up in 1995 while Lithuania has had a market since 1993.</p>
<p>Estonia's is the only operated on a quote-driven system and is seen as the most liquid in the region.</p>
<p>However, with falling yields on T-bills the stock markets have become popular with investors and turnovers are growing.</p>
<p>"This agreement is an historic event of signficance for east and central Europe..we are creating a single market comprising 7.5 million people," Viktors Gustsons, chairman of Latvia's state equities market commission, said.</p>
