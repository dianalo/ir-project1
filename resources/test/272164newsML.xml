<p>Merrill Lynch has upgraded its recommendation for Sing Tao Holdings Ltd to "accumulate" and raised its earnings forecast for the company.</p>
<p>But Sing Tao was rated neutral in the longer term, Merrill said in a report dated December 18.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch analyst Cara Eio said the closure of the loss-making Chinese-language evening newspaper, the Sing Tao Evening Post, would increase net profits by HK$15 million in the financial year ended in March 1998.</p>
<p>Losses attributed to the evening paper are estimated at HK$50 million annually, Eio said.</p>
<p>Merrill forecast net income of HK$37.5 million for the year ended March 1997 and a revised HK$106.6 million for the year ended March 1998.</p>
<p>The company faced the double hit of poor local and overseas property advertisements, a chief source of revenue, in the last financial year, and is trading at close to the bottom, she said.</p>
<p>"Longer term, we believe market share in property advertisement may be lost to property sections of other daily newspapers and a greater use of the internet by property agents -- thus a Long Term Neutral rating," Eio said.</p>
