<p>Argentine cash January wheat was steady in moderate volume at $120 in a market undisturbed by novelty up to midsession, traders at the Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange said.</p>
<p>Wheat is reluctant to drop further despite bearish forecasts for a big crop. April maize was steady in middling turnover, although dry weather may hit sowing and turn bullish, traders said. New crop soybeans slipped, with technical selling by exporters. March sunflower seed was dragged down after soybeans. Oilseed volume was moderate.</p>
