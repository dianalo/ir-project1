<p>Unison Healthcare, which expects to restate its financial results for the nine months ended September 30, was named in a lawsuit alleging that the company, its officers and directors omitted material facts about its performance, law firms said on Friday.</p>
<p>The law firms accused the company and the executives of inflating Unison's stock price.</p>
<p>Representatives of Unison, which provides nursing care, rehabilitation therapy, pharmaceutical and other heath-care services, were not immediately available for comment.  </p>
<p>The law firms of Berger &amp; Montague PC and Bonnett, Fairbourn, Friedman &amp; Balint PC said they filed the suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed on behalf of shareholders who bought Unison stock between May 14, 1996 and March 10, 1997, the law firms said.</p>
