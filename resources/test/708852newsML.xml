<p>Two British aid workers have been taken hostage in Chechnya, police in the breakaway Russian republic said on Saturday.</p>
<p>A district police investigator in the Chechen capital Grozny said the two, named as Camilla Carr and John James, had been abducted from the house they were staying in on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Half a dozen unknown people in masks came into the house brandishing guns and hauled them off to an unknown location, people living nearby told Reuters.</p>
<p>The pair had been working for a Russian organisation called the Centre for Peacemaking and Community Development, helping children who suffered from a 21-month conflict between separatists and Russian troops which ended last August.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the British Embassy in Moscow, James Paver, said inquiries were being made to try to locate them.</p>
<p>"Ministers have been informed and are deeply concerned," he said, adding that the non-governmental Centre had confirmed that two Britons had been working for it in Grozny since early April.</p>
<p>Chechen police said they had arrested three people on Saturday -- the pair's two bodyguards and an official from a Grozny organisation called the Centre for Child Rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The abduction is the latest in a string of hostage-takings in the battle-scarred North Caucasus region, where tens of thousands of people died after Moscow sent in troops in late 1994 to try to stop it splitting from the rest of Russia.</p>
<p>The captors generally demand large sums of money, and securing the release of the hostages, who are currently thought to number more than 20, is becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>Major international aid organisations withdrew most of their staff from the region after six Red Cross workers were shot dead in their beds in December by unknown gunmen.</p>
<p>Some foreigners are still working in Grozny for smaller aid organisations, but they keep a low profile and remain under heavy guard from the separatist authorities.</p>
<p>Paver said the embassy issued advice to travellers that Russia could not guarantee their safety in Chechnya but said there were other British aid workers there.</p>
<p>Isa Akhmetov, prosecutor of Staropromyslovsky disrict of Grozny, accused the organisation the abducted pair worked for of criminal negligence.</p>
<p>"Nobody knew that those foreigners lived there. A report on their kidnapping arrived almost 24 hours later. Their bodyguards thought they would find them independently. This can be qualified as criminal negligence," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>"The people hired to ensure their safety did not work for any law enforcement body. They were hired on a voluntary basis, as close friends of the director the foreigners were working for."</p>
<p>No-one at the Centre was immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The investigator, who gave only his surname, Dudayev, said that the pair were involved in evacuating sick children and that their work was invaluable in a region still stricken by the conflict, which injured many thousands of people.</p>
<p>"They gave all the material help they could. It was essential help," Dudayev said.</p>
<p>But he and other Chechen officials said the two should have let the government know they were in the region. "The only thing which facilitated this crime was that these citizens, who were from a foreign state, should have registered," he said.</p>
<p>The last foreign captive in Chechnya, an Austrian businessman, was freed after an operation by the Chechen authorities at the end of May, Interfax said. Five Russian television journalists are among those still being held.</p>
<p>The separatist leaders of Chechnya, who successfully fought off Russian troops sent to crush their independence bid, have pledged to do all they can to free all the captives now being held, saying rogue groups of criminals are responsible.</p>
<p>Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov has issued a decree saying hostage-takers face the death penalty and their accomplices will get 15 years in jail.</p>
