<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton will go to a NATO summit in Madrid next week resisting pressure from European allies to add more than three countries to the military alliance, senior U.S. officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Allies like France and Italy have pushed Clinton to agree to admit Romania and Slovenia into NATO as well as three new members already agreed -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.  </p>
<p>"The answer is not no, but no at this time," Clinton's National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said, reflecting the U.S. argument that it is willing to consider adding more than three countries to NATO later.</p>
<p>Berger, in a briefing ahead of the July 8-9 Madrid summit, predicted a "lively discussion" about expanding the alliance among NATO leaders.</p>
<p>"But at the end of the day I think it's fair to say there will be a consensus on the three," he said.</p>
<p>He said Clinton's view is that Romania and Slovenia have made enormous progress toward democratic reforms but the three countries being accepted have a longer track record.</p>
