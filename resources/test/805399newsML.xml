<p>Brazil's real on Monday fell 0.28 percent to close at 1.0905 per dollar on outflows of the U.S. currency in the commercial foreign exchange market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Preliminary figures for commercial and financial forex contracts at 1640 local/1940 GMT showed a $85 million deficit, dealers added.</p>
<p>They said that Monday was unlikely to show positive figures at the end of the day, as occurred Friday, when the market initially expected a net dollar outflows but forex contracts posted a $9.4 million surplus.  </p>
<p>"But to push the real lower you do not need a strong dollar outflow because the stock of dollars is low," one trader said.</p>
<p>Despite the $3.9 billion surplus accumulated so far this month, the stock of dollars in the market is very low because of previous central bank dollar buy auctions, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the real would remain under pressure until a strong dollar inflow increases the supply of dollars in the market.</p>
<p>In the interbank floating rate market, the real closed at 1.0905 per dollar, up 0.11 percent, amid dollar inflows, traders said.</p>
<p>In the parallel market, the real rose 0.44 percent to end at 1.135 per dollar.</p>
