<p>The rise in economies in East Europe is likely to dip this year but over the longer term, the region's prospects are bright, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said on Monday.</p>
<p>"Full-year growth in real GDP for eastern Europe and the Baltics is expected to drop to around four percent in 1996 from 5.2 percent in 1995," it said in its annual transition report.</p>
<p>The expected slip reflects the slow growth in the main export markets in the West and tighter fiscal policies in some of the countries.</p>
<p>But for the rest of the decade, countries in the former East Bloc, especially those more advanced in the switch to capitalism, can expect annual growth of 4.0-5.0 percent a year.</p>
<p>"The countries in the region have an educated labour force, and are moving towards greater macroeconomic stability, albeit with occasional setbacks in some countries."</p>
<p>There is no reason the nations' efforts to establish market-oriented economies will not work just as well as they have in southeast Asia, provided the countries adopt flexible policies, it said.</p>
<p>But the former Soviet Union continues to lag, with Russia and the Ukraine yet to show positive growth.</p>
<p>"This is a reflection of the greater length of time it has taken to implement successful stabilisation policies and the generally slower rate at which reforms have been introduced," the report said.</p>
<p>Next year, the region should see stronger growth. It predicted that Russian gross domestic product would grow three percent next year compared to minus three percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Inflation has been further cut in nearly all the 26 countries that the EBRD serves.</p>
<p>"(But) hard-won gains have slipped away in Bulgaria, Romania and Albania, which have seen significant rises in inflation," the report said.</p>
<p>Trade balances in a number of countries have worsened but mainly because domestic investment and consumption have risen sharply while export growth to the European Union has slowed.</p>
<p>Though competitiveness does not appear yet to be a problem, the EBRD urged major restructuring of industry if countries want to see productivity continue to rise.</p>
<p>One of the major advances has been the success of the mass privatisation in countries of the former Soviet Union, Albania and Romania.</p>
<p>Countries with more sophisticated economies, such as the Czech Republic and Hungary, have begun to privatise their utilities and transport industries.</p>
<p>The bank also focused on the need to raise domestic savings and improve an infrastructure, set up with scant attention to either the consumer or the environment.</p>
<p>"Its (infrastructure's) commercialisation and restructuring are central to transition," EBRD chief economist Nick Stern said. "However, some of the more difficult tasks at the heart of transition, such as enterprise restructuring, the rehabilitation and rebuilding of infrastructure, and the building of strong financial and legal institutions, have a long way to go."</p>
<p>The EBRD pointed out that $6 billion in foreign investment had flowed into the region's major infrastructure firms since 1990, mainly into telecommunications and also into gas and electricity firms.</p>
<p>It also urged former Eastern Bloc governments to increase the types of savings instruments and institutions, such as life insurance companies and private pension funds, which would help development of local markets for long-term debt and equity.</p>
