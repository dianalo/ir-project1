<p>Rio de Janeiro's state planning secretary said state electricity firm Cerj would be sold off in a closed envelope auction November 20 with the tender document to be published October 11.</p>
<p>"We have decided on the closed envelope model to maximize the value of the company," said Marco Aurelio Alencar. "All of Cerj's shares held by the state, 77 percent of the company's share capital, will be sold off."  </p>
<p>He said a type of pre-tender document would be published September 5 which would include all the information on the privatization process of Cerj except the minimum price and details on the use of privatization bonds. That information will be included in the final tender document to be published October 11.</p>
<p>The company has been valued at 700 million reais ($700 million) by the state, but the consortium led by Banco Garantia which is drawing up the privatization model for Cerj will set the final price.  </p>
<p>Investors will probably be able to pay 30 percent of the sale price in privatization bonds and 70 percent in cash.</p>
<p>Alencar said interested consortia, which must include an electricity company, would have to pre-qualify for the auction by November 4.</p>
<p>Cerj supplies 25 percent of Rio de Janeiro state's electricity and serves around 1.2 million customers. The company's turnover has been estimated at 600 million reais ($600 million) for this year.</p>
