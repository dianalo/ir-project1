<p>Indian call money ended Friday at 4.75 percent, down from opening levels of 5.25-5.75 percent on reduced demand, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said rates dropped from opening levels as there was borrower resistance at higher levels.</p>
<p>"The market continues to be easy," said a dealer at a state-run bank. "It is difficult to see call money rise much above the repos rate of 5.0 percent."</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India has maintained a rate of 5.0 percent at its repo auctions since the first week of February.</p>
<p>Dealers said prices of government securities were largely down in moderate trade on profit-taking by banks.</p>
<p>They said traded volumes fell to 1.65 billion rupees on Friday from Thursday's 2.88 billion.</p>
<p>Dealers said trades were less as bankers had become slightly apprehensive over liquidity.</p>
<p>"When call opened higher today, some banks feared that call money would tighten," said a foreign bank dealer.</p>
<p>"Action was concentrated in treasury bills and in securities with maturities up to 2002," he said.</p>
<p>The 13.50 percent 1998 traded on Friday at 103.10 rupees against 103.15, the 12 percent 1999 at 100.08 against 100.09 and the zero-coupon bond 1999 at 80.14 against 80.13, dealers said.</p>
<p>The 13.55 percent 2001 slipped to 101.92 from 101.95 while the 13.82 percent 2002 dropped to 101.88 from 101.94, they said.</p>
<p>Dealers said treasury bills maturing in June yielded 8.36 percent, July bills 9.82, August bills 9.92 and September bills 10.02 percent.</p>
<p>There were no trades in commercial paper or certificates of deposit, they said.</p>
