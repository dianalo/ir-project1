<p>British building materials group BPB Plc  warned on Friday if sterling continued its present strength, current  year profits would be adversely affected by up to 20 million stg,  compared to 10 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>The company, however, said its plasterboard products division continued  a strong volume growth in the first quarter of the current year.   </p>
<p>"If present rates of exchange are indicative of the average for the  current financial year, the adverse impact on reported profit could  amount to just under 20 million stg, compared with 10 million in 1996/97,"  the company's chairman Alan Turner told shareholders.</p>
<p>The company's share price fell 5-1/2 pence to 330p after the profit  warning.</p>
