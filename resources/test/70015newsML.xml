<p>Rwandan Vice-President and Defence Minister Paul Kagame arrived in Zimbabwe on Monday for talks on the ethnic violence which has plagued Rwanda.</p>
<p>Kagame said Rwanda could draw a lesson on reconciliation from Zimbabwe which has managed to maintain relatively cordial relations between its racial and ethnic groups since independence from Britain in 1980.</p>
<p>"We are trying to create sufficient stability and carry on those processes and Zimbabwe can be very helpful in terms of enabling us to bring about that stability," he told reporters in Harare.</p>
<p>Kagame was scheduled to meet Zimbabwean Defence Minister Moven Mahachi and other government officials.</p>
<p>Up to one million Rwandans were killed in ethnic violence which erupted in 1994 between the minority Tutsis and majority Hutus following the death in a plane crash of Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana.</p>
