<p>Land and buildings are assets that cannot be carried away in times of trouble, but more and more people are wanting property in Hong Kong ahead of the British colony's handover to China.</p>
<p>Half a year before capitalist Hong Kong reverts to communist China, property prices are reaching skyward again, and analysts said the rise should continue right through the transition.</p>
<p>"I think confidence on Hong Kong after 1997 is strong, and people expect an economic pickup in 1997 and 1998," said Raymond Ngai, senior analyst at UBS Securities. "Investor confidence is strong after the selection of the chief executive designate."</p>
<p>Analysts said fundamentals -- interest rates, affordability and end-user demand -- are the driving forces behind increasing activity and rising prices in the Hong Kong property market.</p>
<p>But with owners holding some of the world's most expensive real estate, and buyers putting down money for flats and offices that may not be completed until after Hong Kong reverts to China at midnight on June 30, 1997, confidence that the territory will remain stable and prosperous was essential, they said.</p>
<p>"Owners, if they lose confidence in (Hong Kong's) prospects, they will sell and go away," said analyst Desmond Cheung of Vickers Ballas. "That will increase supply in the secondary market, but as far as we can understand that is not the case."</p>
<p>The election of a conservative businessman, shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, by a Beijing-appointed committee earlier this month to become Hong Kong's first post-colonial chief executive was seen as heralding continued stability and prosperity.</p>
<p>Tung is seen as a leader who understands the needs of local and international business who also has the trust of Beijing.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong property market staged a strong recovery in 1996 after a slump that took up much of the previous year and a half during which prices crumbled around 30 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said residential market prices have now surged 20-30 percent from late 1995 lows, and office prices have also recovered 10-15 percent, and bidding for luxury homes has become so heated that the government has dropped hints of intervening.</p>
<p>Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said last week there was evidence of rampant speculation in the luxury market, and was concerned that price pressures may spread to the mass market.</p>
<p>But with only six months to the handover, the government was more likely to leave the market alone rather than intervening aggressively, said an analyst with Wheelock Natwest, adding that home prices could rise another 10 to 15 percent next year.</p>
<p>"Sentiment is positive. Liquidity keeps on coming from Southeast Asia and China and should sustain the rise," she said.</p>
<p>The territory's handover is expected to spur buying as well, in that more mainland Chinese corporations seek offices as well as housing for their executives, analysts said.</p>
<p>"These corprations tend to buy, with naming rights, than rent, concluding headline deals that may further improve investment sentiment," Merrill Lynch said in a recent report.</p>
<p>COSCO (Hong Kong) Group, an arm of China's state-owned shipping conglomerate, made a splash this year by laying out HK$2.9 billion (US$380 million) for 15 floors of a 52-storey commercial tower, and renaming it COSCO Tower.</p>
<p>But UBS's Ngai said major China-backed Hong Kong companies like COSCO already had major properties, and mainland companies after 1997 were more likely to only need smaller spaces.</p>
<p>Multinationals a short while ago had been expected to scale down their presence, moving regional operations to places like Singapore that offered lower costs and political stability.</p>
<p>But analysts said their presence in Hong Kong currently appeared stable, with political confidence up and the cost difference lower that previously expected, with some industries such as insurers recently boosting their presence here.</p>
<p>However, a more plentiful supply picture compared to the housing market was likely to keep price increases in the office market relatively moderate next year, they said.</p>
