<p>The Orient Airlines Association(OAA) in October showed the first rise in its freight load factor (FLF) for a year as it rose 2.3 percent from 12 months earlier to 70.1 percent as capacity was cut.</p>
<p>The association's magazine, Orient Aviation, said its members registered "healthy growth,"in passenger traffic for October 1996.</p>
<p>The combined freight tonne kilometres (FTKs) of member airlines in October rose 12.1 percent from a year earlier. Freight capacity (FATKs) rose 8.4 percent in October from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Freight capacity as measured by available tonne kilometres (ATK) grew 9.5 percent in the year to October. Revenue tonne kilometres (RTK) in October were down 8.9 percent from the previous month.</p>
<p>Expanding seat availability put passenger load factors (PLF) under pressure. Scheduled passenger traffic grew by 10.1 per cent in terms of revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) while passengers carried rose 9.2 per cent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>The moderating trend in RPKs and passenger load factor (PLF) increases, which started in July, continued in October, the magazine said.</p>
<p>Available seat capacity (ASKs) grew 10.3 percent from a year</p>
