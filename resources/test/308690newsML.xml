<p>The dismantling of state monopolies in the coffee industry should help Africa increase market share, an analyst said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"I'm fairly optimistic that the adoption of these liberalisation programmes in Africa would, in the long run, stem the decline in African supplies," O.A. Akoto of Goldchrest Commodities Ltd in Ghana told an Asia Coffee conference.</p>
<p>African output declined sharply to 11.6 million 60 kg bags in the 1994/95 season from 17.1 million in 1989/90, he said.</p>
<p>Africa's share of world coffee exports slipped to 18.0 percent in 1994/95 from 22.1 percent in 1990/91.</p>
<p>Akoto said it was vital for African countries to ensure that more of the earnings from coffee sales reached the farmers.</p>
<p>"It's the opportunity liberalisation provides to the farmers," he said.</p>
<p>Akoto said this might help Africa recover ground lost to Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>
<p>But a study by the Neumann Kaffee Gruppe said it was unlikely Vietnam would give back its market share to Africa.</p>
<p>"The dominance of Asian robusta will grow further particularly because of Vietnam, whose target is 350,000 tonnes by 2002, compared to 260,000 tonnes currently," the report said.</p>
<p>"Whatever the price trends...Vietnam will be well placed to answer any future increase of demand," the report concluded.</p>
<p>A transcript of the report was made available here on Wednesday.</p>
