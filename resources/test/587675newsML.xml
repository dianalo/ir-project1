<p>Europe's largest forestry group UPM-Kymmene Oy on Thursday reported a dip in first-quarter profits in line with market expectations, but voiced a more cautious view on full-year prospects than some rivals.</p>
<p>Profit before extraordinary items and tax fell two percent to 1.35 billion markka ($264 million) from 1.37 billion in the year-ago period -- a less sharp fall than reported by some of its rivals.</p>
<p>UPM said it expected 1997 earnings to be about the same as 1996, when it made a profit before extras and tax of 3.6 billion markka and operating profit of 5.6 billion.</p>
<p>That view contrasted with an expected improvement in full-year earnings from Finland's Metsa-Serla and a generally upbeat market view from Sweden's AssiDoman, which both reported earlier this week.</p>
<p>CEO Juha Niemela said he saw a good possibility for better 1997 earnings: the official forecast was on the cautious side.</p>
<p>Asked about chances for a boost to the company's earnings, he said: "There is a good possibility for that as well. But to be on the cautious side we see that we will reach about the same level as we did last year.</p>
<p>"Surprises to the negative side are also possible, but not as likely as they are to the opposite direction," he told Reuters Financial Television in an interview.</p>
<p>UPM's net sales in Q1 dipped to 13.09 billion markka from 13.27 billion in the year-ago period. Its caution came amid sustained uncertainty on prospects for pulp and paper markets, with pulp price hikes only recently starting to look solid.</p>
<p>Analysts' median forecast for UPM-Kymmene's Q1 profit had been 1.35 billion markka in a 952 million to 1.58 billion range: its stock was off 0.50 markka at 122.00 in a muted response to the report in late Helsinki trade.</p>
<p>Overall, UPM-Kymmene said strong economic growth in Europe would underpin an increase in paper consumption, but it voiced fears of overcapacity in fine paper in the second half.</p>
<p>"Sales prices for printing and writing papers are expected to rise, although only marginally during the first half of the year," the company said.</p>
<p>In fine paper, it said European production capacity threatened to rise faster than demand in the second half.</p>
<p>"Market pulp prices probably bottomed out in April," UPM-Kymmene said: Niemela told a news conference that there was "strong faith" in markets that recently announced long-fibre price hikes to $580 per tonne from $520 per tonne would hold.</p>
<p>"I would expect $580 to become the sales price sometime in the summer, at the latest by early autumn," Niemela said, adding that $580 was already the market price in the United States. Pulp prices have traditionally been a compass for paper grades.</p>
<p>On newsprint, UPM-Kymmene said European prices were expected to benefit later this year from a rise in consumption and prices which had started in North America.</p>
<p>But while some analysts agreed, others saw more stability -- continuing the broad uncertainty which has been a hallmark of pulp and paper markets in recent months.</p>
