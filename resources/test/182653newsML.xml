<p>U.S. spot propane prices extended their gains in late trade on Tuesday, largely pushed up by cold weather, players said.</p>
<p>In the Midwest, Conway, Kansas, spot propane edged up another quarter cent, building upon the 1.25 cents gained at midday. Spot material was trading between 54.75 cents and 55.00 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>"It's mostly because of the cold weather in the Midwest," said one Conway trader.</p>
<p>Mont Belvieu, Texas, spot material remained at 52.75/53.00 cents, players said.</p>
<p>Traders said activity was light in the U.S. Gulf Coast because many players left their offices earlier for a conference Wednesday on petrochemical feedstocks.</p>
