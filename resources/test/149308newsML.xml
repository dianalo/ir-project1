<p>DSP Communications Inc. said Tuesday it agreed to acquire wireless networking product maker Proxim Inc. in a stock deal originally valued at about $400 million, sparking a steep drop in DSP's shares.</p>
<p>DSP stock tumbled $17.125 to $35.25 on Nasdaq amid concerns it may have paid too much, while Proxim's shares rose $2.80 to $21.50. Based on DSP's closing stock price of $52.375 on Monday the deal would be valued at $400 million, but the overall value fluctuates with the stock price.</p>
<p>Under terms of the deal, Proxim shareholders will get 0.70 DSP common share for each Proxim share.</p>
<p>Proxim, based in Mountain View, Calif., makes high performance wireless data networking products, and Cupertino, Calif.-based DSP develops and markets chip sets and systems for the wireless personal communications market.</p>
<p>DSP officials said they were confident the  merger would not dilute earnings.</p>
<p>"Analysts estimate that it will be 5 percent dilutive" in 1997, said DSP Chief Executive Nathan Hod at an industry conference in Monterey, Calif. "Knowing what analysts don't know about DSP, I believe this deal will not be dilutive," he said.</p>
<p>The companies said the merger would extend DSP's strength in both wireless voice and data communications. The merger comes a year after DSP acquired CTP Systems Ltd., a leader in wireless telephone systems.</p>
<p>Several analysts called the sell-off an overreaction.</p>
<p>"This is a great story from a long-term perspective," said Robert Kaimowitz, analyst with Unterberg Harris. "I believe it could be marginally dilutive in 1997, but could easily be accretive by 1998 and 1999," he said.</p>
<p>DSP officials said they expected to quickly see benefits from the merger.</p>
<p>"DSP's Israeli subsidiaries have a very beneficial tax situation and we believe that ... some of Proxim's activities will be able to base out of Israel and by doing that we'll be able to get a very significant positive bottom line effect for Proxim," Gerald Dogon, DSP chief financial officer, said on a conference call after the news was announced.</p>
<p>"That's something we'll be working on in the short term, and we believe that already in 1997 it will start to have positive effects on Proxim," he said.</p>
<p>DSP Chairman Davidi Gilo said the deal allowed for an adjustment based on each company's fourth quarter results, which would allow a change in the exchange ratio.</p>
