<p>Singapore bunker quotes were steady on Friday but talks were thin and traders did not expect active enquiries later in the day.</p>
<p>Despite overnight crude gains, some independents still lowered their offers to get business, traders said. "Some are even offering as low as $95 for the 380-cst," one trader said.</p>
<p>The 380-cst grade was quoted by most majors at around $99 per tonne and the 180-cst grade was at $105. MDO and gas oil were at about $200 and $215 respectively.</p>
