<p>Greek farmers lifted smaller roadblocks throughout Greece on Saturday but kept the country cut in half for the 17th day with five major blocks on the main north-south highway.</p>
<p>"We wish the government Merry Christmas because we are going to be here over the holidays," said cotton farmer Yannis Sifakis from the biggest roadblock outside the central town of Larissa.</p>
<p>"Some small roadblocks were lifted but the big ones will stay put until our demands are met," he added.</p>
<p>The farmers want cheaper fuel and equipment, and state subsidies on products but Prime Minister Costas Simitis has rejected their demands, saying their cost would distance Greece from its European Union convergence goals.</p>
<p>He has ruled out police intervention and appears determined to ride out the crippling blockade.</p>
<p>The farmers lifted roadblocks around the norther port of Salonika, Greece' second biggest city. But road access with Athens is still blocked in Larissa and other points to the south with thousands of tractors.</p>
<p>Commerce and industry have warned that the damage to Greece's struggling economy from the blockade could be irreversible and made clear they want a settlement.</p>
<p>Exporters, hoteliers and industrialists put losses at more than $500 million. The Association of Northern Greek Exporters said exports had dropped by 42 percent in December.</p>
<p>About 700 foreign trucks have been stranded, with drivers -- mostly British, Dutch, Bulgarian and Turkish -- complaining of lack of food, water and proper sanitation.</p>
<p>The farmers allowed some 200 foreign trucks to continue their journey as a gesture of goodwill on Thursday.</p>
