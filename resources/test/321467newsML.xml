<p>The joint announcement said Newman would acquire a 55.4 percent Denway stake from China Lounge Investment Ltd, a subsidiary of Guangzhou Jinda Motors Holdings Enterprises, and a 17.4 percent stake from Hero China Investment Ltd, a subsidiary of Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd.</p>
<p>Newman, whose sole business function is the holding of the Denway stake, is indirectly held by Yue Xiu and Guangzhou Jinda Motors.</p>
