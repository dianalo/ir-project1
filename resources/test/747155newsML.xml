<p>The decision by German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt to block BASF AG's attempt to sell its Kali &amp; Salz unit to Potash Corp could put thousands of jobs in jeopardy, BASF said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The German chemical giant had hoped to sell its 51 percent stake in Kali &amp; Salz (K&amp;S) to Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc (PCS) for 250 million marks, saying jobs could only be secured if K&amp;S was a global competitor.</p>
<p>PCS's offer was the best option for retaining 7,500 jobs at K&amp;S, Gerhard Wolf, BASF board member responsible for K&amp;S, said, terming Rexrodt's decision was a bad blow for the security of thousands of jobs in the potash fertiliser industry.</p>
<p>But the Economics Minister insisted that the merger would not be in the public interest. "An obvious and concrete danger of anti-competition does not serve the public interest. Because of this I did not give my permission for the sale," he said.</p>
<p>Rexrodt made it clear that he thought the 7,500 jobs at K&amp;S were just as safe, regardless of whether or not it was sold.</p>
<p>Possible monopolistic price hikes were one of the dangers to the public good, Rexrodt said. K&amp;S already has a near monopoly in Germany with 80 percent of the market, and if the merger had gone ahead it would have dominated the market.</p>
<p>BASF still wants to sell its 51-percent K&amp;S stake, and it said it did not rule out any course of further action at the moment, either by selling shares on the bourse or by seeking another industrial partner.</p>
<p>The remaining 49 percent in K&amp;S belongs to the east German development agency BvS.</p>
<p>PCS chairman Charles Childers said that the group would review the purchase of K&amp;S after the Rexrodt decision.</p>
<p>"While we are disappointed with the ruling, we must respect the decision of the Minister and we will now thoroughly review our position," Childers said.</p>
<p>The IGBE mining and energy union said its immediate concerns lay with employees at the K&amp;S and related industries.</p>
<p>"With this decision, the opportunity to secure the future of the German potash industry has been missed. The 7,500 jobs have to be secured," the IGBE said in a statement.</p>
<p>The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) were disappointed.</p>
<p>"The future with a new shareholding partner is unclear. But we want to see support for one of the most important economic sectors in northern and eastern Hessen," SPD representatives Eberhard Fischer and Ilse Stiewitt said in a statement.</p>
<p>BASF said that the merger as planned would have ensured the continued employment of K&amp;S's 7,500 employees, as well as employment in related areas, and "would have greatly improved Kali &amp; Salz's competitiveness in the future."</p>
<p>BASF on its own had only limited chances of turning the company into a global competitor because of overcapacity in the potash fertiliser market.</p>
<p>Originally the German cartel office blocked the sale, citing possible dominance of the German potash market.</p>
<p>Potash and BASF could have applied to Berlin courts to have the cartel watchdog decision overturned,but instead it opted to ask Rexrodt, who can overturn a cartel office decision if there are overrriding implications for the economy or for employment.</p>
<p>"Clearly these paragraphs in German competition law are based on ensuring the public interest is served. But the real struggle for existence is being fought on a transparent and hard-fought global market," Wolf said.</p>
<p>Ralf Bethke, management board chairman of K&amp;S, said: "This is very bad news for the company. Now we have to reassure our employees and their representatives, who supported the planned merger, that we will do our best to continue our operations."</p>
