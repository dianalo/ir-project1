<p>Hit by sluggish car sales at home, Honda Motor Co Ltd said on Friday that it would scale back its planned domestic output for July, and analysts said other Japanese automakers would eventually follow suit and revise down their output plans later this business year.</p>
<p>Japan's top five carmakers, except for Mazda Motor Corp, suffered a drop in domestic car sales in May even while domestic production grew, helped by higher exports.</p>
<p>Domestic car sales have been affected by an April rise in the national sales tax to five percent from three percent, which has forced consumers to tighten their purse strings.</p>
<p>"All Japanese carmakers are likely to revise down their domestic car output plans, because the combined total of their projected output is too large," Seiji Sugiura, an industry analyst at Nomura Securities Co Ltd's research unit, said.</p>
<p>"They need to cut their output plans by at least 600,000 units... I am sure they will revise it down by autumn," he said.</p>
<p>Japan's 11 vehicle makers planned total production of 11.33 million vehicles in the current 1997/98 business year, against output of 10.60 million units in the previous year.</p>
<p>"They (top five major makers) have to lower their output because their production plans are too optimistic. Overall domestic production is likely to fall by 200,000 or 300,000 units this year, or be flat against last year at the best," Kankaku Research senior analyst Nobuaki Yanachi said.</p>
<p>He said carmakers may reduce their output in the second half of 1997/98 after a build-up in inventories. Their domestic inventories fell sharply due to higher sales ahead of the April sales tax increase and strong exports.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association chairman Yoshifumi Tsuji said that Japan's domestic sales in the June 1 to June 17 period were down five percent from the same period a year ago. He said domestic car sales in 1997/98 were likely to be lower than in the previous year.</p>
<p>A Honda spokesman said on Friday that the company would scale back its planned production at its two domestic plants in July in line with slowing domestic orders.</p>
<p>Honda will cancel its planned extra day of output in July at the No.2 line at its Sayama plant, near Tokyo.</p>
<p>But Honda stopped short of saying it would revise down its production plan for this business year. "We have no plan to revise our 1997/98 production plans," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Toyota Motor Corp refused to discuss recent Japanese media reports that it would cut its domestic output in June and July, pushing down its daily production rate to below the current level of about 15,000 vehicles.</p>
<p>A Toyota spokesman said the company has no plans to revise down its domestic output plan, under which it forecast production of  3.55 million vehicles in 1997/98, up 1.4 percent from 3.50 million.</p>
<p>Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Mitsubishi Motors Corp and Mazda also said they have no plans to revise their domestic output estimates because of expected good demand for their new models.</p>
