<title>USA: Catastrophe insurance rates down 17 pct in 1997.</title>

<p>The rate on line for large catastrophe excess of loss insurance programs fell 17 percent in the January renewal season, approaching pre-Hurricane Andrew levels, according to an industry report released today.</p>
<p>The report by global reinsurance intermediary Guy Carpenter &amp; Co Inc was based on January insurance program renewals of major U.S. companies writing on a nationwide basis. Guy Carpenter is a subsidiary of Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos Inc.  </p>
<p>Guy Carpenter's Monitor report found that even after factoring in the additional covers being bought by insurers, an average 10-15 percent savings was seen in overall property catastrophe reinsurance costs.</p>
<p>Decreases in rate on line are the result of changes in program structure, catastrophe terms or conditions as well as competition for premium dollars, the report said.</p>
<p>Reinsurance capacity, or supply, also remains abundant, the report said.  </p>
<p>National insurers and regional companies with books of business that resemble large national insurers can easily attract $500 million of traditional capacity and up to $1 billion if traditional is combined with non-traditional, the report said.</p>
<p>For smaller, regional companies, as much as $300 million can be purchased, the report said.</p>
<p>Although capacity remains readily available, Guy Carpenter said in its report that it has not seen a significant increase in the program limit, or amount of reinsurance being purchased for large catastrophes.  </p>
<p>Program limits remained steady at a projected $230 million for 1997, following sharp increases in the three years after the capacity crunch in 1993, the report said.</p>
<p>Instead, insurers are using the savings from decreases in the rate on line to buy more coverage for the smaller, more frequent catastrophe risk retained on their books.</p>
<p>As the size of the loss needed to trigger most large catastrophe reinsurance programs has increased over the last several years, some insurers are now retaining more of that lower-level risk.  </p>
<p>And property insurers were hit in 1996 by an increasing number of smaller, but more frequent, catastrophe losses.</p>
<p>According to Property Claim Services, in 1996 there were 41 catastrophes that resulted in a record high of 3.8 million claims, producing $7.35 billion in insured losses, the report said.</p>
<p>But an event producing an insured industry loss of $3.5 billion is now needed before most catastrophe programs will attach, or go into effect, the report said.  </p>
<p>The result has been a significant resurgence in demand for aggregate reinsurance cover, which provides protection for those frequent, smaller losses, the report said.</p>
<p>With the soft market, the rates for these products have proven to be attractive to insurers seeking to cede that risk.</p>
<p>In an aggregate cover, losses are accumulated throughout the term of the contract into a total dollar amount.</p>
<p>That amount is then subject to the insurer retaining a certain percentage or dollar amount of the losses.</p>
<p>All losses can then be added together and recovered thereafter.</p>
<p>Competition for property catastrophe premiums is expected to remain keen during the next major renewal period in April and May, Guy Carpenter said in the report.</p>
