<headline>NYMEX natgas called flat to lower ahead of expiry.</headline>

<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were expected to open unchanged to slightly lower Thursday amid early talk of softer cash prices, industry sources said.</p>
<p>May over-the-counter trade ranged from $2.05 to $2.06 as of 0940 EDT, with earlier trades confirmed done at $2.04. This follows Wednesday's settlement at $2.06 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>Early cash prices on Transco (Station 65) were talked at least 10 cents lower at $2.12-2.17 as buyers anticipated milder weather throughout most of the U.S. this weekend.  </p>
<p>Other traders argued that cash may be retreating to meet futures ahead of May's expiry this afternoon.</p>
<p>Traders pegged May resistance at $2.09, $2.13 and $2.20-2.21, with support seen at $2.035 and $1.925.</p>
<p>On ACCESS, May last traded 0.3 cent higher at $2.063.</p>
<p>Helping to support the market in ACCESS was AGA's storage report showing a decline of seven bcf last week to 26 percent of capacity, which was slightly below expectations for a slight build. Overall stocks were still 256 bcf, or 45 percent, above year-ago levels. Eastern storage, which dropped last week by two bcf, was still 175 bcf ahead of a year ago. In the West, stocks still lagged 54 bcf behind year-ago tallies at 172 bcf.</p>
<p>Taking a look ahead, traders said June resistance was at $2.33, while support was pegged at $2.03 and then along the short-term up trendline at $2.00.</p>
<p>In Wednesday's cash market, Gulf Coast prices jumped more than 10 cents to $2.15-2.20. Midcontinent pipes gained a similar amount to about $2.05. Gas at New York city gate rallied by about 15 cents to the $2.50s.</p>
<p>Temperatures throughout the Northeast and Midwest are expected to continue to hover below normal until this weekend when warmer air is forecast to arrive. In the Southwest, Weather Services Corp is calling for milder weather by this weekend.</p>
