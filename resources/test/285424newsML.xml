<p>Health advocates Friday slammed a plan by the Environmental Protection Agency to let states decide how to protect asthma victims in areas where sulfur dioxide emissions hit hazardous levels in short bursts.</p>
<p>The EPA issued a proposal this week that would allow states to weigh whether they needed to tighten controls on sulfur dioxide (SO2) pollution from sources such as power plants when concentrations reached 0.6 parts per million in repeated five-minute spells.</p>
<p>"It has the potential to result in uneven public health protection," said Ron White of the American Lung Association.</p>
