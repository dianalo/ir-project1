<p>Staples Inc and Office Depot Inc on Friday denounced as "absurd" the Federal Trade Commission's renewed opposition to their proposed merger.</p>
<p>The FTC said the merger would lead to higher prices, but les and Office Depot said post-merger efficiencies would create significant savings that would be passed on to consumers</p>
<p>"For the FTC now to prevent the transaction from closing is astonishing to us," said Thomas Stemberg, Staples chairman. "We do not understand their rationale. Each month this merger is delayed costs consumers $40 million in savings."</p>
<p>Office Depot Chairman David Puente said the two companies "have worked diligently with the FTC staff over the last nine months to assuage their concerns, and in fact, we agreed with their recommendation to divest 63 stores. For the FTC commissioners not to accept their staff's recommendation, which Staples and Office Depot complied with, is absurd."</p>
<p>The 63 stores were to be sold to OfficeMax Inc.</p>
<p>The FTC has scheduled a news conference on the matter for 1330 EST/1830 GMT.</p>
