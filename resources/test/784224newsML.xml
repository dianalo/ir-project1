<p>Australia's openers Mark Taylor and Matthew Elliott sailed almost untroubled through the first session of the fifth Ashes test against England on Thursday.</p>
<p>They gave the touring team an ideal start in good batting conditions at Trent Bridge by reaching 84 for no wicket at lunch, with captain Taylor on 34 and Elliott on 49.</p>
<p>Memories were revived of the Ashes test at the same venue in 1989, when Taylor and current Australia coach Geoff Marsh batted throughout the first day in reaching 301 without loss.</p>
<p>England captain Michael Atherton -- a debutant that day -- was denied the change of luck his team desperately needed, when he lost the toss for the fifth successive time in the series.</p>
<p>Atherton had even changed the coin he used, but Taylor called correctly again.</p>
<p>Unlike previous matches, there was no doubt about what his choice would be and Taylor was able to take advantage himself by improving on his poor batting record in the series.</p>
<p>Atherton was forced to try six different bowlers before the interval, including both Melbourne-born Hollioake brothers, Adam and Ben, who had been thrust into a test debut.</p>
<p>The brothers were the first picked by England since Peter and Dick Richardson in 1957, while Ben Hollioake, at 19, became the youngest England test player since Brian Close in 1949.</p>
<p>It was a daunting introduction to test cricket in only his 12th first-class game as his first three overs of medium pace went for 23 runs before off-spinner Robert Croft replaced him.</p>
<p>The other bowlers had been more economical but no more successful on what was clearly the best batting strip of the series.</p>
<p>Dean Headley beat Elliott on a couple of occasions, almost causing him to play-on after scoring five. By lunch Elliott, who made 199 in the previous test, had become the first Australian to reach 1,000 runs on the tour, at an average of almost 67.</p>
<p>Headley also had a good shout for leg before against Taylor turned down as fortune continued to favour the Australians.</p>
<p>They lead 2-1 in the six-test series and, as the holders, need only to draw here to ensure they keep the Ashes.</p>
