<p>SEC is reviewing charges by former National Association of Securities Dealers examiner Theresa Carr that NASD avoided aggressively probing abuses in the municipal bond market, Carr's lawyer said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Jacob Zamansky, a partner with Singer Zamansky in New York City, said he and Carr met with officials of SEC's office of compliance, inspections and examinations on Friday, at their request.</p>
<p>Lori Richards, director of SEC's office of compliance, inspections and examinations, was unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>"They met with us for about three hours. They were taking copious notes," Zamansky said about the meeting. "They basically wanted to hear the backup to her charges."</p>
<p>Carr was a senior compliance examiner in the region 10 office until June 19, when, according to a complaint she filed in New York Supreme Court last month, she was effectively forced to resign.</p>
<p>Carr, who is seeking $20 million in penalties from NASD, said she was pushed out after uncovering and pursuing violations by major securities firms of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's "pay-to-play" rule G-37.</p>
<p>The rule restricts political contributions by bond firms to state and local elected officials with whom they do business.</p>
<p>The SEC oversees the enforcement activities of NASD.</p>
