<p>Belgian non-ferrous metals group Union Miniere said on Wednesday it expected its results this year to be better than in 1996 when it returned to profit for the first time in five years.</p>
<p>The remarks by Chairman Etienne Davignon to the annual meeting echoed those by Chief Executive Officer Karel Vinck in March when the company first published its preliminary figures.</p>
<p>"Overall, we expect 1997 to be better than 1996, thereby confirming the Group's ambitions with respect to future performances after the Industrial Plan has been fully implemented, i.e. by the end of 1998," Davignon said.</p>
