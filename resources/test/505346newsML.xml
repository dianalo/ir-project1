<p>Hong Kong stocks look set for an early tumble in the week ahead after U.S. inflation figures released on Friday heightened fears that the Federal Reserve may become more aggressive in raising interest rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Producer Price Index rose 0.4 percent in March compared with expectations of a 0.1 percent rise.</p>
<p>The data prompted a slide of 21/32 in the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond, bringing the yield to 7.17 percent, and a drop of 148.36 points in the Dow industrials to 6,391.69.</p>
<p>"The HSI (Hang Seng Index) is set to fall sharply on Monday," Cheerful Research Co said in its weekly market letter.</p>
<p>"We anticipate volatile trading throughout this week."</p>
<p>Some investors had been hoping Hong Kong share prices had reached a short-term bottom after a recovery last week from a recent six-month low, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index rose 157.90 points last Friday to 12,516.60, bringing the week's gains to 312.01 points, or 2.56 percent. The index had hit a six-month low the previous week.</p>
<p>"We may see about a 200 to 300-point drop on Monday. Initial support will be at around 12,200," said Ben Kwong, director of research at Dharmala Securities.</p>
<p>He said investors had already discounted a possible 25 basis point rise in U.S. interest rates at the next Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting on May 20 but were now fearing a larger increase.</p>
<p>"It seems like investors are worried that there may be more rises in interest rates and also that maybe interest rates will be increased by more than 25 basis points in May," Kwong said.</p>
<p>He said U.S. March consumer price data, due on Tuesday, would be watched closely for more signs on the interest rate outlook.</p>
<p>"Overall sentiment will turn a little bit cautious and investors will wait for more indications on the interest rate front," Kwong said, adding he expected a trading range of 12,000 to 12,600 points for the week.</p>
<p>Patrick Chia, research director at China Everbright Research, agreed. "At least the Hang Seng Index has found short-term support around 12,000," he said, adding that 12,600 points was likely to be a short-term top.</p>
<p>Alex Tang, head of research at Yamaichi International, said the H-share index may continue to outperform the overall market.</p>
<p>The index of mainland Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong surged 9.55 percent last week to close at 1,034.90 on Friday.</p>
<p>A number of H-share companies are due to report final results this coming week including Shanghai Petrochemical Co Ltd, Qingling Motors Co Ltd and Yizheng Chemical Fibre Co Ltd.</p>
<p>"People are expecting that after the results announcement, H-shares may outperform again and some are buying shares ahead of the results announcement," Tang said.</p>
<p>China Light &amp; Power Co Ltd is due to release its interim results on Friday.</p>
