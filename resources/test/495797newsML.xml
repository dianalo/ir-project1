<p>Borg-Warner Automotive Inc said Wednesday it planned to seek a buyer for its forged powdered metal engine connecting rod business unit, citing a lack of strategic fit with its core businesses.</p>
<p>Borg-Warner said it has retained Lehman Brothers to solicit proposals from qualified purchasers. The company said it will only sell the business if an acceptable buyer is found.  </p>
<p>The connecting rod product line was acquired as part of the company's 1995 purchase of the Precision Forged Products Division from Federal-Mogul Corp.</p>
<p>The connecting rod product line represented less than 15 percent of the division's total revenue at the time but is expected to grow to almost $35 million in 1997, Borg-Warner said.</p>
<p>"While the connecting rod business is experiencing rapid growth and is a solid, process-oriented business, it does not offer a strategic fit with our core businesses," John Fiedler, Borg-Warner Automotive chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Borg-Warner said the company knew the line was not a good fit but continued to invest in it to assure continued service and to take full advantage of the growth opportunities.</p>
<p>"Our resources are better spent, however, on the core technologies that will drive our growth and profitability in highly-engineered products and systems," Fiedler said.</p>
<p>The connecting rod business is located in Romulus, Michigan, and employs 330 people.</p>
<p>Borg-Warner supplies engineered components and systems, primarily for automotive drivetrain applications.</p>
