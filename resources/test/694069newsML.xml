<p>Taiwan's construction shares soared at mid-morning on Friday, reflecting widespread expectations that the island's long-sluggish property market was recovering, brokers said.</p>
<p>With 70 minutes left, at 0250 GMT, the entire construction sector had risen 6.29 percent, while the main index was up 1.45 percent.</p>
<p>Ever Fortune topped the gainers' list, surging by the daily seven percent limit to T$35.1. Ruentex Construction rose T$1.1 or 4.95 percent to T$23.3.  </p>
<p>Pacific Construction advanced T$1.8 or 6.16 percent to T$31.</p>
<p>Brokers said the construction industry has showed signs of recovery.</p>
<p>Loans extended by Taiwan banks to construction firms grew 0.8 percent to T$404.230 billion year-on-year in May, marking the first rise in two years, the central bank said on Friday.</p>
<p>The figure had gradually recovered since it fell 20.66 percent year-on-year in September 1996. This indicates a gradual bottoming-out of the real estate market, the bank said in a statement.  </p>
<p>"Many people have expected the stock rally to help boost the sluggish property market," United Securities' analyst Lin Long-hsien said.</p>
