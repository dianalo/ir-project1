<p>Aluminium producer Comalco New Zealand said on Wednesday it was optimistic about the impact of a major smelter upgrade despite slumping to a NZ$13.5 million after-tax loss in 1996 from a 1995 profit of NZ$106.9 million.</p>
<p>Kerry McDonald, Managing Director of the Comalco Ltd controlled company, said the result reflected special circumstances including a slump in metal prices in 1996.</p>
<p>"The timing was unfortunate in terms of having a sharp reduction in metal price at a time when we were incurring higher costs through the commissioning of the upgrade," he told Reuters.  </p>
<p>McDonald said he was unable to comment on profit forecasts because of stock exchange issues.</p>
<p>Comalco NZ spent NZ$464 million upgrading its Tiwai Point smelter which saw annual capacity increase to 313,000 tonnes from 270,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>"I'm optimistic about the impact of the upgrade. The project has gone well. It is a complex commissioning process because of the extent of the changes that we are making, and we are making a number of significant process changes at the same time... and I would say already that has proved to be a sound decision," McDonald said.  </p>
<p>"It is delivering increased production already and it is showing every sign that it will have the desired impact to reduce costs and improve efficiencies," he said.</p>
<p>Comalco increased staff during the upgrade process but the company recently cut staff by 200.</p>
<p>McDonald said Comalco was driving very strongly to reduce costs in all aspects of the business.</p>
<p>"At the same time we are expecting operating efficiencies will continue to lift and improve to realise the benefits of the upgrade." -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746</p>
