<p>Hungarian oil and gas company MOL Rt had 1996 net income of 22.2 billion HUF, a sharp rise from 1.1 billion in 1995, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>MOL's consolidated net revenues rose to 503 billion forints, up from 370 billion in 1995, and consolidated operating profits rose to 26.6 billion HUF, compared to 6.4 billion in 1995, the company said.</p>
<p>Pre-tax profits were 25.3 billion HUF, up from 900 million in 1995, while earnings per share were 226.1 forints in 1996, compared to 10.2 forints per share in 1995.  </p>
<p>MOL, in announcing its preliminary results compiled in accordance with international accounting standards, said operating profit before an extraordinary reduction in provisions for environmental liabilities was 21.3 billion HUF.</p>
<p>It said the figure takes into account 2.55 billion HUF provisions for future staff reductions in 1997.</p>
<p>"MOL achieved significant improvement in net cash flow and managed to keep working capital tight while net debt (gearing at the year-end 1996 was 23.6 percent), remained at a low level compared to international norms," the statement said.  </p>
<p>MOL benefited from the release of 5.3 billion HUF in environmental provisions following a review of its liabilities by an independent consultant, the statement said. MOL also received a cash transfer of 3.84 billion HUF from chemicals company TVK Rt, the statement added.</p>
<p>It quoted MOL chairman Zoltan Mandoki as saying: "1996 has been a successful year for MOL as the company has continued to show improved financial performance and delivered results ahead of expectations."</p>
<p>"We have seen an improving trend on prices and achieved better discounts on crude oil and wider margins."  </p>
<p>MOL was beginning to benefit from increased consumer energy prices, Mandoki said.</p>
<p>"The increase in prices is also beginning to show through, although MOL remains committed to gaining a fairer return on natural gas production, supply and storage business over the medium term," he said.</p>
