<p>German insurance giant Allianz AG Holding said on Thursday it will pay around 660 million marks to buy French group Compagnie de Navigation Mixte's (CNM) 34 percent stake in Allianz Via Holding France (AVHF).</p>
<p>Allianz announced the plans in a mandatory bourse statement. It said that CNM has held the stake in AVHF since 1990 when the two groups merged their French insurance groups into a joint holding group.</p>
<p>Allianz said the move will allow it to improve its administration and become more competitive.</p>
