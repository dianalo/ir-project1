<p>Warehouse workers at Brazil's key port of Santos have decided to start a strike today over a dispute about backpay, a spokeswoman for the port said.</p>
<p>"They have decided to go ahead with a strike," she said.  </p>
<p>The stoppage will affect imports but not exports, she said.</p>
<p>Officials at the Administrative Portworkers Union said over the weekend the stoppage would bring 90 percent of all import activity and 70 percent of export activity at the port to a halt.</p>
<p>Port officials on Monday said they were still assessing the extent of the strike.</p>
<p>The officials also said they do not know how long the strike will last.</p>
<p>Previous strikes at the port have affected shipment of commodities such as sugar, soybeans, wheat and orange juice.</p>
