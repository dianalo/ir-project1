<headline>FORECAST - German bund yield to climb steadily.</headline>

<p>German bund yields are expected to end the year above their current levels and then continue to rise steadily into 1997 as an economic recovery in Germany finally kicks in, analysts said.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey published on Wednesday polled 33 economists for their forecasts on the 10-year benchmark German Bund yield and all but two said they saw the yield at six percent or over by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>The yield on the 10-year Bund currently stands just under the six percent level.</p>
<p>The median forecast for the yield by the year-end is 6.3 percent. Analysts said pressure on Bunds was most likely to come from the United States in the short-term, where data showing growth picking up is expected.</p>
<p>"Whether or not we get an interest rate rise in the U.S., data is likely to show stronger growth, which will cause the long-end to sell off," said David Brickman, European economist at Yamaichi in London.</p>
<p>But analysts said they expected domestic and European news to provide direction for the Bund next year.</p>
<p>Although most analysts agree that there will be little inflationary pressure in Germany in 1997, most believe economic growth will have begun to gather pace by the end of next year.</p>
<p>The median forecast for Bund yields by the end of 1997 is 6.60 percent.</p>
<p>"World trade growth, economic recovery in Europe and a weaker mark will all boost German export growth and it shouldn't be difficult to achieve 2.5 percent growth next year," said Catherine Lee, economist at R.H. Wrightson and Associates in London.</p>
<p>"On top of that we will have ongoing concerns about European Monetary Union (EMU), which will reduce the attractiveness of German bonds to German investors," Lee said.</p>
<p>Lee said as early 1998 approached, when the convergence criteria for membership of EMU will be assessed, worries would intensify, which could put further pressure on bunds.</p>
<p>Analysts said the need to meet EMU convergence criteria could lead the Bundesbank to hold back from raising interest rates until the end of 1997, which could weigh on Bunds if growth is perceived to be advancing too quickly.</p>
