<headline>Fleet, Dreyfus sue Middlesex County, Mass. - paper.</headline>
<dateline>BOSTON 1996-12-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Fleet Financial and Dreyfus Group, part of Mellon Bank, jointly sued Middlesex County, Mass., in an effort to recover about $4.7 million of debt, the Boston Globe said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Middlesex Commissioner told the Globe that he hoped legislative aid--loan guarantees--would let the county issue new bonds to pay off its creditors.</p>
<p>The state emergency board last Friday refused to allow the county to borrow more money, saying it lacked a detailed financial plan.</p>
<p>Officials with the firms and the county could not be reached for immediate comment by Reuters.</p>
<p>The county on Friday defaulted on $4.5 million of general obligations owned by the banks, which are seeking to get repaid for the notes plus interest.</p>
<p>A Middlesex Superior Court judge late Tuesday ruled in favor of the creditors, ordering that proceeds from the pending sale of a troubled hospital be put in escrow until various creditors' claims are sorted out, the Globe said.</p>
<p>Middlesex County Hospital, which is being sold to Olympus Healthcare Group for $4.4 million, owes its creditors around $19 million.</p>
<p>The sale to the for-profit company is expected to close around the end of the month, the company told the paper.</p>
