<p>The Thai cabinet has approved a finance ministry proposal to scrap and cut banking taxes to help boost offshore banking activities and make Bangkok a regional financial hub.</p>
<p>An official at Government House said the cabinet lifted a 10 percent withholding tax on profits derived from out-out offshore banking business that are remitted abroad by Thai-based banks.</p>
<p>It also waived a 10 percent income tax on revenue from syndication of out-out loans.</p>
<p>Out-out loans refer to the borrowing and import of offshore funds for relending to foreign clients outside Thailand.</p>
<p>The official said the government also agreed to scrap a 10 percent withholding tax on interest paid on selected incoming offshore loans tapped by Thai state enterprises.</p>
<p>The official said the tax cuts would help Thailand compete with Singapore and Hong Kong in hosting regional offshore banking business.</p>
<p>He said the government hoped the tax cuts would boost current low volumes of out-out loans arranged by 48 Thai-based offshore banking units.</p>
