<p>Irish Farm Minister Ivan Yates told a European Parliament inquiry into the BSE crisis on Tuesday that he believed the European Union had acted properly in protecting consumers from the dangers of mad cow disease.</p>
<p>"The (EU's) veterinary legislation is among the most stringent in the world, and some third countries have even criticised it for being too restrictive," he said.</p>
<p>Yates, representing the current EU presidency, was speaking at the opening session of a parliamentary probe into the EU's policy on bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).</p>
<p>He said EU member states had acted on the basis of two principles since worries about the disease first arose -- that human health must be protected, and that all measures taken must be based on the most recent scientific findings.</p>
<p>This had been done in 1990 and 1994, when EU farm ministers ordered up research into the disease, setting out guidelines for studying the disease among cattle, and imposed safeguards on carcasses of beef exported from Britain.</p>
<p>"Without wishing to take the place of your committee of inquiry, I am nevertheless inclined to consider these measures reflected the state of scientific knowledge available at the time of their adoption," he said.</p>
<p>"They could reasonably be considered to guarantee consumers the level of protection which they have a right to expect."</p>
<p>The parliamentary probe is expected to last three months and to look into accusations that the EU put concerns of the beef market ahead of the health of consumers.</p>
