<p>ONEOK Inc said Thursday it agreed to acquire privately-held PSEC Inc, a 30-year old Oklahoma independent oil and natural gas producing company. The acquisition will be made for an undisclosed amount of cash and ONEOK common stock and will include PSPC Ltd, the managing general partner and operator of an Oklahoma gas gathering system.</p>
<p>ONEOK spokesman Weldon Watson declined to discuss the purchase terms, but did say the number of shares to be issued "is not dilutive."  </p>
<p>PSEC is owned and operated by two veteran Oklahoma producers, Ray Potts and Bob Stephenson. PSEC is an acronym for Potts Stephenson Exploration Co, ONEOK said.</p>
<p>The two men are also principals in PSPC, Ltd., which operates and holds a 42 percent interest in the Sycamore Gas Gathering System located in Carter County, Okla.</p>
<p>The other Sycamore Gas owners are individuals and private companies, Watson said.</p>
<p>The transaction includes 180 wells with proven reserves of 21 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 168,000 barrels of oil and significant development potential, ONEOK said.</p>
<p>The reserves are concentrated in three strategic Oklahoma production areas; the Springer field in Carter County, the Wellston field in Lincoln County and the Featherston field in Pittsburg County.</p>
<p>Some of the producing properties are already connected to ONEOK's current operations and will enhance operational efficiencies, the company said.</p>
<p>"We believe the infill development potential of these properties is excellent and we will begin a development drilling program very soon."</p>
