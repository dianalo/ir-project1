<p>Brazilian stocks closed up in heavy trade on growing optimism that Congress will approve a constitutional amendment allowing presidential re-election, traders said.</p>
<p>The Bovespa index of the 49 most-active stocks ended up 1.78 percent to close at 74,270. Volume was high at 734 million reais ($705 million).  </p>
<p>The market was boosted by a new poll showing a re-election amendment, seen crucial to the success of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic reforms, would sail through a lower house committee of Congress next week, traders said.</p>
<p>The market was expected to see heavy volume throughout the month of January as Congress debates the re-election issue and investors set positions for the year.</p>
<p>Benchmark Telebras preferred closed up 2.78 percent at 84.90, with traders eyeing a move into the 90 range in the near future.</p>
<p>"We think it will go to 90 soon and stay there for a while," said one trader.</p>
<p>State oil firm Petrobras preferred shares rose 0.56 percent to close at 181, while Eletrobras  ELE_p.SA preferred continued Tuesday's weakness, ending down 0.51 percent at 391.</p>
