<p>Queensland casino operator Jupiters Ltd said on Wednesday it expected to achieve solid revenue and profits based on strong performances from casinos in the state capital of Queensland and on the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>The company said its operations had become increasingly competitive in the latest six months in both the premium player and local markets. Net profit in the six months to December 31, 1996, soared to A$20.17 million from A$8.12 million a year ago.</p>
<p>"It is expected that further enhancements and upgrading of the properties will also support growth in earnings," it said.  </p>
<p>Casino revenue rose to A$183.41 million in the latest six months from A$145.63 million and hotel revenue rose to A$60.31 million from A$51.98 million.</p>
<p>The Conrad Jupiters casino and hotel on the Gold Coast achieved a 32 percent rise in total revenue to A$154.6 million, with average daily casino patronage steady at about 13,000. It said visits by overseas premium players rose by 50 percent.</p>
<p>The Conrad Treasury casino in Brisbane increased revenue to A$89.1 million in the latest half year from A$81.0 million, with daily patronage up 1,000 to 10,000.  </p>
<p>The company achieved a 1995/96 net profit of A$33.86 million which was well above analysts forecasts but below the previous year's A$43.28 million net profit.</p>
