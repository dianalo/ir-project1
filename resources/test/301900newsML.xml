<p>Denmark's Queen Margrethe II, celebrating 25 years on Europe's oldest throne, heads a royal family remarkable for the affection and respect it commands in a fiercely egalitarian society</p>
<p>Elderly suburbanites and inner-city punks can be seen on state occasions, waiting on freezing street corners for a glimpse of the queen, her 86-year-old mother Queen Ingrid, or the princes Frederik and younger brother Joachim.</p>
<p>Danish society has an unwritten commandment that says nobody should think themselves better than anybody else. But even the country's tiny handful of republicans believe that Margrethe should be president.</p>
<p>"As the world opens up more, the need grows for people to know their own roots. Perhaps the interest (in us) is also due to people being more interested than before in history," the queen told a news conference ahead of the January 14 jubilee.</p>
<p>Royal controversy is rare and mild compared to the scandals plaguing her cousins in Britain. The Danish queen's public smoking and an affair between Crown Prince Frederik and a former underwear model are about the spiciest items.</p>
<p>SMOKING ROW WITH SWEDEN</p>
<p>The smoking issue revived ancient enmities with neighbouring Sweden this month when Swedish newspaper columnist Hagge Geigert slammed the Danish monarch for setting a bad example by lighting up in public places and "spreading poison around her".</p>
<p>Geigert said that the queen "puffed away freely" during a visit to asthmatic residents of an old people's home and he compared her unfavourably to Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf, who also smokes but only in private.</p>
<p>Danes have little affection for Swedes at the best of times and criticism of their beloved queen from across the water caused outrage.</p>
<p>Copenhagen newspapers covered their front pages with indignant headlines: "Smoke War against the Swedes", "Let the Queen Smoke in Peace", "Mind your own business, Sweden" and "Keep up the puffing, Margrethe".</p>
<p>"Is it a sign of responsibility for the Swedish king to slink off to the toilets to have a drag on the sly?", the tabloid Ekstra Bladet asked.</p>
<p>Asked during the jubilee news conference to comment on her "smoking problem" the queen's response was terse.</p>
<p>"I have no problem," she said.</p>
<p>On the other main issue of public interest, 28-year-old Prince Frederik's three-year romance with Danish model Katya Nielsen, 26, debate was less concerned with the relationship itself than with the queen's reported opposition to the match.</p>
<p>A Gallup poll showed unanimous public support for the prince's right to choose his own bride and the Politiken broadsheet appealed to Margrethe in an editorial.</p>
<p>"The time for arranged marriages is past and the monarchy will survive longer with a happy person on the throne. A mother's heart should understand this," it wrote.</p>
<p>But the heat of publicity and frost from the palace appeared too much for the lovers and in October 1996 lawyers for the beautiful daughter of a provincial businessman issued a statement.</p>
<p>"Katya Storkholm Nielsen hereby wishes to make it known that her relationship with His Royal Highness Crown Prince Frederik is terminated. Katya Storkholm Nielsen does not wish to discuss the matter further," it said.</p>
<p>Both Frederik and Joachim, who married Hong Kong economist Alexandra Manley in November 1995, are clearly adored by their mother, who peppers her conversation with references to "my boys", but they are far from pampered.</p>
<p>A high-speed car crash which injured both princes bought them a well-publicised reprimand from their mother in 1998 and the boys' father, French-born Prince Henrik, does not refute his reputation as a strict parent.</p>
<p>"The most important thing in bringing up children is to help them get the best out of themselves. If you really want to help your children you have to sometimes show them the harshness of life," he told journalists at the capital's Amalienborg Palace.</p>
<p>FIRST WOMAN TO ASCEND THRONE SINCE 1353</p>
<p>Margrethe became queen at the age of 31 on January 14, 1972 when her father King Frederik IX died after a two-week illness.</p>
<p>Thanks to 1953 constitutional reform which amended the right of succession to include royal daughters, she became the first woman to ascend to the 1,012-year-old throne since the first Queen Margrete was crowned in 1353.</p>
<p>A second cousin to Britain's Queen Elizabeth she is also related, through the Greek royal family, to Prince Philip.</p>
<p>Educated at two Danish universities and France's Sorbonne as well as Cambridge and the London School of Economics in Britain, she once described herself as an eternal student.</p>
<p>She is a capable artist who has designed sets and costumes for television and the Royal Ballet and has illustrated a Danish edition of J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings".</p>
<p>Asked by a journalist if she had also mastered more mundane skills, such as driving and cooking, she said that she was a reasonable cook but had not driven herself for so long that she no longer had a valid licence.</p>
<p>"Let me put it this way, my food wouldn't kill anyone but I'm not sure that you would survive my driving," she said.</p>
<p>Jubilee celebrations are relatively modest. Activities on January 14 are restricted mainly to family, including other Scandinavian royals, with a thanksgiving service and official banquet.</p>
<p>The highlight of the anniversary for the public will be a January 15 carriage procession through Copenhagen escorted by a troop of cavalry and televised gala performance from the Royal Ballet in the evening.</p>
