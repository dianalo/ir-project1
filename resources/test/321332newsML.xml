<p>Mexican stocks ended down on Wednesday on profit-taking after a volatile session, analysts and traders said.</p>
<p>"The market adjusted (downwards) due to profit-taking, it is still consolidating. The market may also have been affected by forecasts that primary rates will increase this evening," said Daniel Romo, an equity analyst at the Bancrecer bank.</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index  closed down 22.25 points, or 0.60 percent, at 3,717.34.</p>
<p>Volume  was vigorous at 116.7 million shares.  </p>
<p>A Reuters survey of Mexican Money Market traders showed an average forecast assignment rate of 23.03 percent for bellwether 28-day Cetes (Treasury Certificates) at Banco de Mexico's primary auction, which would be an increase of five basis points from last week's auction.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said the bourse was still consolidating recent gains.</p>
<p>"The closing level was important, as it avoided completing technical signs of a downward trend and increased profit-taking. We're confirming continued consolidation," said Hector Jimenez, a technical analyst at the Inverlat brokerage.  </p>
<p>The IPC reached a midday peak at a record intraday high of 3,758.31 on the back of the Dow average,itself up on relief in the market following testimony given by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to the U.S. Senate Budget Committee.</p>
<p>On the broad market, a total of 115 stocks changed hands, of which 55 ended off while 39 were up. "Most stocks that declined merely did so on profit-taking, there was nothing special," a trader said.</p>
<p>Debt-ridden holding company Sidek headed the decliners .PG.MX, off five centavos at 86 centavos, followed by the Invermexico financial group, off three centavos at 70.  </p>
<p>Bus and coach manufacturer Dina headed the gainers, up 80 centavos at 4.80 pesos, on what traders said was a favorable outlook for Q4 1996 earnings.</p>
<p>"Dina broke through resistance and it looks like rallying further. Even though it did lag behind the market, we're recommending it," a trader from the Interacciones brokerage said.</p>
