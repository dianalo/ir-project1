<p>A British investment banker said on Tuesday emerging markets investment fund managers were responsible for a big jump on Tuesday in the price of Solidere GDRs on the London Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Angus Blair, a director of ING Barings, told Reuters he took a group of U.S. and European fund managers to Beirut last week at Solidere's invitation and they were impressed by the way Lebanon is rebuilding its capital city and its financial markets.</p>
<p>Asked the reason for the jump in the Solidere GDRs, Blair told Reuters in a telephone interview: "It is client interest in Solidere."</p>
<p>The GDRs, issued in November 1996 at $11.50, rose on Tuesday to $17.625 from last week's $12. That was 70 percent above the price of the underlying Solidere A shares which traded at $10.375 on Tuesday on the Beirut Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The jump excited the Beirut financial markets because Solidere's A and B shares have underperformed since getting off to a spectacular start in 1994 and have been close to their historic lows for weeks.</p>
<p>Solidere is Lebanon's biggest company and accounts for more than $1.8 billion of the total $2.4 billion capitalisation of the Beirut Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Blair said the nine fund managers he led to Beirut was the biggest group of portfolio investors to come out to Beirut at once.</p>
<p>The group travelled from Lebanon to Jordan and will also visit other regional and North African countries, but Blair said each of them was able to telephone London and order a purchase of Solidere GDRs if he wished.</p>
<p>"They were impressed by the will everyone showed to work towards a single goal and bring about the rehabilitation of Beirut as a financial and regional centre, and you can't do that without rebuilding the city centre," Blair said.</p>
<p>The fund managers were also excited by their visits to Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce and Banque Audi, the Beirut Stock Exchange, acting finance minister Fouad Siniora and (central bank vice governor) Nasser Saidi, Blair said.</p>
<p>"They were very impressed by the management of Solidere. They had no complaints about the way it was being run," he added.</p>
