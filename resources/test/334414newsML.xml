<p>Czech police are astonished by the case of a man who was shot through the head but only sought medical treatment six days later, CTK news agency said on Monday.</p>
<p>The 48-year-old from the eastern city of Liberec was shot in his apartment by an entrepreneur on January 18 in what police described as "careless use of a weapon".</p>
<p>The bullet from a handgun entered his left nostril and passed through his head before leaving by a temple, the Czech agency quoted doctors as saying.</p>
<p>The man sought medical help only last Friday and has spent three days in intensive care in a Liberec hospital.</p>
<p>"It is an extraordinary curiosity that the shot man was fully conscious and fully capable of communicating with us," a Liberec police spokesman said.</p>
<p>The wounded man will probably need up to seven weeks to recover. Police have charged the businessman with a grievous threat to health, CTK said.</p>
