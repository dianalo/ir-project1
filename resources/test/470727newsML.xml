<p>Insurance premiums for airliners fell further last year and show little or no sign of reversing that trend in 1997, aviation insurers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Aviation insurance rates and premiums fell to unsustainable levels during 1996, and the last quarter of the year...brought a further acceleration in premium rate reductions," Barry Wilkes, chairman of the Aviation Insurance Officers Association (AIOA), said in a statement.</p>
<p>Some 70-80 percent of airlines renew their insurance between September and December.</p>
<p>"The next testing period is the 1st April renewals, but the market remains extremely soft, dogged by surplus capacity worldwide," Wilkes, an aviation insurer with Generali, said ahead of the AIOA's annual meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Other downward pressures on aviation rates are better than average loss figures in recent years and falling profits on international scheduled services, the AIOA said.</p>
<p>"We're still going through hard times from an underwriting point of view," Wilkes told reporters, although he added that his own company's experience in 1995 was turning out better than originally expected.</p>
<p>Rates in all four insurance categories -- aviation, marine, non-marine and motor -- have been declining steadily for several years as the market goes through a cyclical downturn.</p>
<p>However, Wilkes declined to put a percentage figure on aviation rate declines, but did say "reductions are fairly high."</p>
<p>The London Market leads around half to two thirds of all international aviation business and underwites 30 to 40 percent of the aviation market.</p>
<p>AIOA representatives said London had lost some business in recent years to other international centres, particularly France, which are prepared to offer lower rates than London- based insurers.</p>
<p>The number of aircraft losses last year was the highest since 1985, but the estimated cost of hull losses -- at $477 million for Western built jets -- was one of the lowest figures for 10 years.</p>
<p>The AIOA said this was because many of the aircraft lost or damaged were old with a comparatively low value.</p>
<p>Two big question marks over the final claims bill for 1996 are the Valujet and TWA crashes, Wilkes said, adding that it was not yet possible to say whether the industry had made a loss on the year.</p>
<p>The Valujet crash last May in Florida is expected to cost upwards of $200 million, while the claims total from TWA flight 800, which crashed after take-off from New York was "anyone's guess", said former AIOA chairman Jeff Weston.</p>
<p>Passenger fatalities last year were at one of the highest levels since 1985, with 1,306 people losing their lives in 11 accidents involving Western built jets.</p>
<p>A change in the rules governing compensation to passengers and their families from April 1 for death or injury could lay insurers open to higher claims payments.</p>
<p>However, in the current climate, it would be difficult to persuade airlines to pay higher premiums, AIOA's Rod Dampier said, although claims could rise by $100-200 million a year as a result of the change.</p>
<p>The removal of compensation limits under the Hague Protocol/Warsaw Convention will primarily affect European flights. The change does not apply to the U.S. or Japan, where there is already no limit on compensation payouts.</p>
