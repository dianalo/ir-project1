<p>In a dramatic climbdown, South Korean President Kim Young-sam agreed Monday to meet opposition leaders to resolve a crisis over a new labour law that ignited more than three weeks of strikes.</p>
<p>Adding to signs that authorities were seeking a peaceful end to violent confrontation with labour unions, prosecutors said they would hold off arresting seven strike leaders sheltered in Seoul's Myongdong Cathedral.</p>
<p>Kim has rejected repeated demands by opposition parties to discuss the new bill, which makes it easier to fire workers and maintains a ban on free trade union association until 2000.</p>
<p>His about-face followed a decision by the militant Korean Confederation of Trade Unions to call off an indefinite strike, a move that put South Korean factories back to work on Monday with no interruptions for the first time since the law was rammed through parliament on Dec. 26.</p>
<p>Opposition parties, who have thrown their weight behind the unions, welcomed Kim's offer for talks over lunch Tuesday at the presidential Blue House.</p>
<p>The breakthrough came after Kim met the heads of South Korea's main faiths -- Buddhist, Roman Catholic and Protestant -- who all pleaded with him to exercise restraint, offering the president a face-saving way to abandon his hard line.</p>
<p>The stock market jumped 3.5 percent in response, but economists cautioned that despite an end to labour strife, the country still faced wrenching economic problems.</p>
<p>There was speculation that Kim, under pressure from right-wingers in his New Korea Party to crush militant unions in the final year of his presidency, would seek to meet unionists half-way.</p>
<p>Political analysts said Kim might agree to supplement the labour law with more guarantees of job security and advance the timetable for recognising the outlawed confederation, whose leaders are hiding in the cathedral.</p>
<p>While many South Koreans agree the country's rigid labour practices need overhauling, there is anger at the way the law was adopted in a half-empty chamber of ruling party deputies during a six-minute clandestine dawn session.</p>
<p>The tactics of the New Korea Party gave further fuel to critics who say Kim's presidency is growing increasingly harsh and authoritarian. Kim has been adamant that he would neither scrap the law nor revise it, arguing that South Korea needed the bill to recover its international competitive edge.</p>
<p>"Any resolution of the strikes isn't going to resolve Korea's economic problems," said Jonathon Dutton, an analyst at SBC Warburg in Seoul.</p>
<p>He noted that slowing growth and a ballooning balance of payments deficit were largely the result of falling prices for major export items, especially semiconductors.</p>
<p>"One way in the long run to improve labour competitiveness is to make the work force more flexible and increase the downward pressure on wages. So long-term the law is positive, and encouragingly,the Koreans have decided to tackle the problem," Dutton said.</p>
<p>Output losses from wildcat strikes were expected to reach more than $3 billion. Export losses were put at $483 million.</p>
<p>Police have so far picked up five of 20 unionists on a wanted list.</p>
<p>In a sign the country was getting back to work, Kia Motors said workers had put in two hours overtime on Monday to try to make up for losses in 25 days of stoppages.</p>
