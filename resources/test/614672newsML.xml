<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates, spots end mostly down.</headline>

<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mostly down on Monday with money demand being greatly reduced on a lack of new domestic A share issues, traders said.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most actively traded seven-day contract fell to 9.15 percent from 12.00 percent last Friday.</p>
<p>Total turnover of the six-contract market fell slightly to 6.2 million losts from 6.55 million lots.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>Traders said a lack of new A share offers after last week's heavy issues was the major reason pushing down the rates today.  </p>
<p>"There were a dozen of new issues last week on the A markets, which boosted fund demand on the repo market and made the repo rates move at a high level for almost the whole week," said one trader. "A sudden pause in the new issues today reduced money demand sharply, depressing the repo rates."</p>
<p>But a number of new issues have been scheduled from Wednesday, which will support the rates in the next few days, traders said.</p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly down on Monday on a shortfall of funds due to the recent heavy new A share issues, traders said.  </p>
<p>The most actively traded 10-year bond that matures in June 2006 fell to 119.90 yuan from 120.48 yuan.</p>
<p>Combined volume of the seven-contract market rose to 736,868 lots from 509,708 lots.</p>
<p>Traders said money that investors used to bid for the new A share issues last week was still frozen, making the spot market short of liquidity.</p>
<p>New A share issues and the performance of the A share markets will be the key factors deciding the spot market trend in the short term, traders said.</p>
