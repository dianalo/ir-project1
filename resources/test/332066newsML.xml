<p>The Italian government said on Friday it believed an end was in sight to a protracted pay dispute in the engineering and metalworking industry and summoned union and business chiefs for talks on Monday.</p>
<p>"The government has noted...fresh readiness to seek agreements in order to conclude the negotiations," said a government statement issued after Prime Minister Romano Prodi met leaders of the country's three main trades union confederations.</p>
<p>It said it would call a meeting of the three union bodies, CGIL, CISL and UIL, and the employers' umbrella group Confindustria "as a matter of priority."</p>
<p>Labour Minister Tiziano Treu, who attended the Prodi talks, said the meeting had been set for Monday "in order to begin a decisive discussion".</p>
<p>"The climate has changed in a positive sense. Today we have seen there is a will to reach the last lap," Treu said.</p>
<p>The dispute, which involves some 1.7 million workers, is expected to set the tone for pay deals in a number of other Italian industrial sectors.</p>
<p>The unions in the sector, FIOM, FIM and UILM, have already staged three one-day stoppages to press their claims for increases in wages for the 1996-98 period since the previous contracts expired last June.</p>
<p>The government suggested in December that management give workers an average 200,000 lire ($125) per month pay increase.</p>
<p>Unions, which had been seeking a 230,000 lire increase, accepted the proposals but the main industry group Federmeccanica has stuck to its original 139,000 lire offer, saying it will not accept a deal that fuels inflation.</p>
<p>Federmeccanica president Gabriele Albertini said in Bologna on Friday that he thought the prospects for striking a deal had never been better.</p>
<p>"For the first time in 25 years, we have the opportunity to renew a contract in a non-inflationary way. Let's hope this objective can be reached in the coming days," he said.</p>
<p>The optimism was tempered, however, by continued differences between employers and unions over whether the government proposal was inflationary. Prodi says it is not.</p>
<p>The dispute centres on the interpretation of a landmark wage deal in July 1993 between the labour confederations, Confindustria and the government which scrapped automatic index-linked wage rises.</p>
<p>The two sides differ over the extent to which workers should be compensated for loss of purchasing power since the last contract was signed.</p>
<p>"What's new is that Federmeccanica is saying, contrary to what it said before, that it wants to conclude a contract. That is a step forward which we welcome but it is not enough," CGIL leader Sergio Cofferati said.</p>
<p>"The settlement reached must be in line with the July accord," he said.</p>
<p>The dispute has weighed on monetary policy, with Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio waiting to cut interest rates until he was satisified that any deal would not fuel inflation.</p>
<p>He acted on Tuesday, announcing a cut in the key discount rate to 6.75 percent from 7.50 percent after preliminary inflation data for January showed a year-on-year rise of 2.6 percent.</p>
