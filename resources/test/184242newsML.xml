<p>Indonesia is forecast to import about 1.1 million tonnes of corn in the 1996/97 U.S. marketing year (Oct/Sept), compared with trade estimated at 900,000-1.0 million tonnes in 1995/96, a U.S. embassy report said.</p>
<p>The report, made available to Reuters on Tuesday, said corn imports during the first nine months of the marketing year totalled 784,561 tonnes, with 426,076 tonnes coming from the United States.</p>
<p>It said a government move to plant hybrid corn was not expected to lower corn imports in the 1996/97 marketing year, adding that its success was uncertain.</p>
<p>High hybrid corn seed prices and some difficulty in fertiliser distribution could hamper efforts to increase corn production, the report said.</p>
<p>The government has begun cultivating hybrid corn strains over 50,000 hectares, eventually expanding to 500,000 hectares.</p>
<p>Budiarto Soebijanto, head of the Federation of Indonesian Feedmillers, said last week Indonesia aimed to end corn imports by 1999 with the introduction of the hybrid strain.  </p>
<p>The report said Indonesian corn production in 1996/97 was estimated at 6.0 million tonnes, against an estimated 6.2 million tonnes in the previous marketing year.</p>
<p>In another report, the embassy estimated Indonesian unhusked rice production at 51 million tonnes or 33.15 million tonnes of milled rice in 1997, against an estimated 50 million tonnes or 32.52 million tonnes respectively in 1996.</p>
<p>"This forecast seems reasonable at this time since urban encroachment on paddy land is expected to be more than offset by some increases in inter-cropping with estate crops and expansion of new crop land," the report said.</p>
<p>Beddu Amang, head of the state logistics agency BULOG said late last month that Indonesia's unhusked rice production was projected to rise to 50 million tonnes this year from 49 million tonnes in 1995.</p>
<p>He said domestic rice stocks stood at 2.5 million tonnes at the end of October, down from 2.8 million tonnes in June.</p>
<p>The report said an estimated 3.25 million tonnes of rice, including about 235,000 tonnes of broken and glutinous rice from Thailand, were imported in 1995. It said imports in the first nine months of this year totalled about 1.1 million tonnes.  </p>
<p>The report said an additional 200,000 tonnes are expected to arrive before the end of this year, bringing total 1996 imports to about 1.3 million tonnes.</p>
<p>"Prospects for a good crop, ample government and privately-held stocks and the lack of inflationary pressure on consumer prices strongly suggest that Indonesia will step back from large imports in 1997," it said, adding that imports are forecast at 800,000 tonnes next year.</p>
<p>It said 300,000 tonnes of the 800,000 tonnes expected to be imported next year had already been purchased.</p>
