<p>Irish bonds were broadly unchanged on Monday in very light trade, with investors risk-averse ahead of Tuesday's FOMC meeting, dealers said.</p>
<p>"People are squaring their positions and hanging fire as they wait to see what comes out of this meeting and as a result there's no price action and no direction in the market today," a dealer said.</p>
<p>"We're expecting the Fed to tighten short rates by about 25 basis points, but you never know - it could be 50 basis points."</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets on Tuesday to consider monetary policy, with the odds on an interest rate rise shortening dramatically last Thursday after Fed chairman Alan Greenspan stressed the importance of pre-emptive action to tame inflation.</p>
<p>A poll of 48 economists by Reuters after Greenspan's remarks showed 34 expected the Fed to raise its federal funds target to at least 5.50 percent on Tuesday from 5.25 percent.</p>
<p>"We're underperforming Germany by one basis point this afternoon and there's further negativity around in the form of divergence on the Italian and Swedish markets," a dealer said.</p>
<p>"But the Irish market has been helped by an excellent CPI number last week, and by firmer sterling this morning."</p>
<p>Dealers said reaction to a U.S. interest rate hike, which would push bond prices downward, also depended on whether markets expect another rise to follow.</p>
<p>"If the U.S. payroll data due next week is strong, suggesting overheating in the U.S. economy, markets will begin to factor in a further quarter percent rise," a dealer said.</p>
<p>Analysts are predicting a relief rally on the back of the possible rates rise, but warn that it would be ephemeral.</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon Monday the spread on the Irish 10-year bond had widened to 100 basis points over Germany, dealers said.</p>
<p>By 1600 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was unchanged from Friday's close at 101.11 to yield 6.20 percent while the benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 was up 10 pence from the close at 107.40 to yield 6.90 percent.</p>
