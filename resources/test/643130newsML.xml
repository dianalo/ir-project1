<p>Attorneys for convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh pleaded for his life on Friday, saying he was not a monster but a misguided former soldier who thought the government was waging war on the American people.</p>
<p>Appealing to the jurors who will decide if McVeigh is sentenced to death or life in prison, defence attorney Richard Burr asked them to put aside their emotional response to days of poignant and painful stories from bombing victims.</p>
<p>He said he would present testimony from about two dozen of McVeigh's former teachers, Army buddies, co-workers, bosses and his father William.</p>
<p>"They will help you come to understand the reality of Timothy McVeigh," said Burr, who specialises in death penalty cases. "You will begin...to see him for a person who could be your brother, your son, your grandson."</p>
<p>McVeigh was convicted on Monday of murder and conspiracy charges in the April 19, 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building, an attack that killed 168 people and wounded more than 500 others.</p>
<p>As he has throughout the trial, McVeigh betrayed no emotion. But he seemed to be watching intently, as did the seven men and five women on the jury.</p>
<p>During this phase of the trial, the jury will decide between a sentence of death or life in prison. The prosecution rested its side on Friday morning after testimony from 38 bombing survivors, rescuers, and those who lost loved ones.</p>
<p>The defence attorney told jurors: "There's also a person at the centre who you will not be able to dismiss as a monster or a demon, but who could be your son, your brother, your grandson."</p>
<p>"We believe...you will come to the conclusion that the right response is a life sentence," he said.</p>
<p>He said McVeigh was enraged by the government's 1993 fiery siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, where some 80 people died. Waco became a rallying cry for right-wing extremists who felt federal agents provoked the tragedy and the U.S. government violated the Branch Davidians' rights.</p>
<p>"The fire of Waco did keep burning in Mr. McVeigh," said Burr, noting McVeigh travelled to Waco during the 51-day siege.</p>
<p>Reading Solider of Fortune magazine and watching amateur videos about Waco, McVeigh came to believe "the government had declared war on the American people," he said.</p>
<p>"He felt the government assumed responsibility for the lives that were snuffed out that day," Burr said.</p>
<p>Burr also offered a description of McVeigh's past, calling him a serious-minded student who was socially awkward and who wanted intimate relationships with women but "had a hard time finding it." He said too that McVeigh was a gun enthusiast who worried about the impact of gun-control legislation.</p>
<p>Legal observers said the defence has a daunting task in trying to keep McVeigh off Death Row.</p>
<p>"No juror can vote for life in the face of such poignant testimony from victims," said local attorney Scott Robinson, who has followed the case closely. "Timothy McVeigh has no chance of escaping a sentence of death from this jury."</p>
<p>The first to testify on McVeigh's behalf were people he knew in the Army. He served in the Gulf War and won a Bronze Star.</p>
<p>A former Army sergeant said McVeigh had been an outstanding soldier during infantry training in Fort Riley, Kansas, while Royal Witcher Jr., who served in the same armoured vehicle unit as McVeigh, described their combat experience.</p>
<p>"He was a model soldier," he said. "I looked up to him."</p>
<p>Under cross examination, McVeigh's Army buddies said they had not seen him for several years prior to the bombing.</p>
<p>A former neighbour of McVeigh's from Pendleton, New York, John McDermott broke down on the witness stand. "I liked him very much, I trusted him," he said. "I can't imagine him doing a thing like this."</p>
<p>In an unusual moment during a trial filled with sorrow, the defence displayed a photograph of McVeigh's former bedroom that sent chuckles through the courtroom. McVeigh's bedsheets were decorated with the comic-strip character Garfield the Cat.</p>
<p>The mostly calm, soft-spoken delivery by the defence attorney marked a sharp contrast to the emotionally wrenching two and a half days of government witnesses who testified about the impact of the bombing on their lives.</p>
<p>A letter written by 9-year-old Clint Seidl capped off the prosecution's case. Despite the death of his mother in the bombing, the boy wrote: "I still make my mom Mother's Day and Valentine cards like the other kids."</p>
