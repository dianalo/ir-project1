<p>Pharmacueticals group F.H. Faulding and Co Ltd said on Thursday that it was pleased with the 1996/97 year and expected to report higher profits.</p>
<p>"Yes I think we have already said we are expecting modest growth," Faulding chief executive Ed Tweddell told reporters after an address to the Securities Institute of Australia.</p>
<p>"Some of the analysts say we have a funny definition of modest, but yes, we are expecting growth on last year obviously," Tweddell said.</p>
<p>"Apart from China, I think overall it has been a solid year."  </p>
<p>Faulding's half year result included an abnormal provision of A$7.5 million related to a restructuring of its slower-than-expected China operations.</p>
<p>Tweddell said he was pleased with the Chinese operation in the second half of the year "as distinct from being horrified at the previous six months".</p>
<p>"Obviously there is still red ink there... but we are aiming to break even next year."  </p>
<p>Tweddell said the China operations would not meet Faulding's five year acquisition projection but remained a very important part of its long term programme and he hoped the major issues had now been addressed.</p>
<p>Faulding said at the half year that its 1996/97 result depended heavily on the commercialisation of new products approved in the United States.</p>
<p>Asked if the company was on track, Tweddell said: "Yes I don't think you will be disappointed."</p>
<p>Faulding achieved a 1995/96 net profit if A$28 million from A$36.5 million a year earlier.  </p>
<p>Tweddell said U.S. sales of Faulding's anti-cancer drug Kadian/Kapanol had been slower than expected due to tough competition but worldwide income from the drug was expected to be "spot on our target" for 1996/97.</p>
<p>The company's U.S. subsidiary Faulding Inc currently had 13 products before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, under a business plan through to 2003, hoped to make up to 12 FDA submissions a year, he said.</p>
<p>Faulding did not expect to finalise the US$70 million bid to acquire the 38 percent minority shareholding in Faulding Inc until around the end of October, with a response from independent directors expected in about a month.</p>
<p>The company had yet to decide the timetable of its proposed rights issue to fund the deal, he said.</p>
<p>Speaking earlier to the briefing about Faulding's pharmaceutical distribution operations, Tweddell said the company was seeking to grow its business in Asia, where it has already established a joint venture in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Faulding was planning a series of announcements demonstrating the company's commitment to retail pharmacy and "in particular to look at the 'wellness versus illness' concept through our acquisition of health care companies like (vitamin group) Cenovis," he said.</p>
<p>"There is also a major opportunity to leverage this distribution capability to hospitals," he said.</p>
<p>Faulding shares ended steady a A$7.50 on Thursday.</p>
