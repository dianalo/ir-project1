<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar that he supported Spain's measures to whip its finances into shape for a single European currency, the Spanish government said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Prime Minister Aznar communicated to the German chancellor the Spanish government's determination to meet the convergence criteria established in the Maastricht treaty to join a single currency," it said in a statement.</p>
<p>"The chancellor, in turn, repeated the support of his government for the budgetary measures approved by the Spanish government, which he had already expressed at the European special summit celebrated in Dublin on October 5," it said.</p>
<p>Aznar flew to Germany on Tuesday at Kohl's invitation for dinner and talks that lasted over two-and-a-half hours in the German leader's homeland state of Rhineland-Palatinate.</p>
<p>Spain said the talks were extremely cordial and demonstrated the high level of understanding between both countries on various questions related to the European Union.</p>
<p>"The conversations held during the dinner Kohl held for Aznar...showed the high level of support and understanding on the part of Chancellor Kohl towards Spain's aspirations of meeting the Maastricht convergence programme," it concluded.</p>
<p>The two decided that Spain and Germany would hold their annual summit in January.</p>
