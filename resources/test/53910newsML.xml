<p>Northern Transvaal, inspired by two Joost van der Westhuizen tries in the first 15 minutes, beat Free State by a comfortable 51-30 (halftime 37-9) in their Currie Cup rugby match at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday.</p>
<p>Although Free State came back strongly after the break with tries from lock forward Braam Els, veteran centre and captain Helgard Muller and replacement hooker Charl Marais, the Blue Bulls effectively clinched the match after a one-sided first half.</p>
<p>Livewire scrumhalf van der Westhuizen went over right under the posts in the seventh minute after selling an outrageous dummy from the base of a five-yard scrum. Flyhalf Lance Sherrell converted.</p>
<p>Seven minutes later, the Springbok halfback notched up try number two after an excellent build-up on the drive by number eight Schutte Bekker and lock Krynauw Otto. Sherrell's second conversion, and his third successful kick out of three, opened up a four point advantage.</p>
<p>Left wing Hannes Venter and centre Danie van Schalkwyk both went over before halftime after being put away by Sherrell to give Northerns a substantial lead which they never surrendered.</p>
<p>Former Springbok flyhalf Sherrell contributed 26 points for the home side through four conversions and six penalties.</p>
<p>Northerns, with their ninth win from 10 games in this season's competition, stay on top of the section B table with 18 points.</p>
<p>Scorers:</p>
<p>Northern Transvaal - Tries: Joost van der Westhuizen (2), Hannes Venter, Danie van Schalkwyk, Ruben Kruger. Conversions: Lance Sherrell (4). Penalties: Sherrell (6).</p>
<p>Free State - Tries: Braam Els, Helgard Muller, Charl Marais. Conversions: M.J. Smith (3). Penalties: Smith (3).</p>
