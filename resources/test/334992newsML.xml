<title>USA: Issuers, Treasury Dept. summit on "yield burning".</title>
<headline>Issuers, Treasury Dept. summit on "yield burning".</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-01-27</dateline>

<p>Representatives of states and localities had a "very serious discussion" with the U.S. Treasury Department top brass on "yield burning" on Monday, and the ball is now in the department's court, a spokesman for the muni-bond issuers said.</p>
<p>"I consider it a positive meeting," Mark Schwartz, president of the National League of Cities, said in a press briefing at Treasury. "They spent an hour and a half with us, which is a signficant amount of time. Now we sit and wait."  </p>
<p>The meeting was the first for issuer groups with Donald Lubick, Treasury's assistant secretary for tax policy.</p>
<p>Lubick had no comment after the session, attended by representatives from the League, National Conference of State Legislatures, Government Finance Officers Association, National Association of Counties, National Association of Bond Lawyers, and the Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities.</p>
<p>Yield burning refers to allegations that bond underwriters overcharge issuers for U.S. Treasuries bought in the open market and used in bond refinancing deals.  </p>
<p>The IRS last year surprised localities with a plan that says issuers can avoid having interest on the bonds declared taxable by paying Treasury the difference between the price they paid and the spot price of the securities on purchase date, plus interest.</p>
<p>Issuers urged the IRS at a January 15 hearing to adopt a new plan that puts the onus on Wall Street firms that knowingly sold inflated Treasuries to municipalities, and on those few localities, if any, that were aware of the move.  </p>
<p>Groups made clear January 15 that they are willing to cooperate with the IRS. They added, however, that only those issuers that have been targetted by SEC investigators should have to provide extensive documentation to regulators.</p>
<p>"Our position (today) was no different than in the past," Schwartz said, after the meeting. IRS should not hold localities accountable that truly were "victims" of yield burning, he said.</p>
<p>C. Vernon Gray, a councilman for Howard County, Md., said his county did a "self audit" shortly after the IRS revenue procedure was released.  </p>
<p>"We discovered that we had no problem and that it would not be necessary to enter a closing agreement with IRS. The problem is that the IRS may find something different. That is the main problem," Gray said in questioning after the session.</p>
<p>An aide to Gray said Treasury officials at Monday's meeting appeared open to suggestions. "It's clear they are willing to consider alternatives," said the aide, declined to be identified.</p>
<p>Frank Shafroth, chief lobbyist for the League, said Treasury officials obviously thought groups had been diligent. "They didn't say you guys have failed to make an effective case. Do your homework and come back."</p>
<p>Schwartz agreed. "We were not chewed out," he said. Lubick seems to understand the dilemma. "I'm positive he's going to take a hard look at this," Schwartz said.</p>
