<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Friday called on Arab and Moslem countries to take steps to force Israel to stop building Jewish settlements in and around Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>"These things...call for a quick Palestinian, Arab and Moslem move to face these dangerous developments not only against Jerusalem but also against the Palestinian people....," he told reporters after briefing Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali on the crisis in the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>Arafat said such moves would be based on previous decisions at Moslem and Arab summit meetings.</p>
<p>Resolutions adopted in Islamabad and Cairo last year threatened to freeze diplomatic ties established by some Arab and Moslem states with Israel.</p>
<p>Arafat accused Israel of aiming, through Jewish settlements, to cut Arab East Jerusalem off from Palestinian territories in the West Bank.</p>
<p>"I told President Ben Ali that despite these difficulties, we will pray together in Jerusalem, capital of the Palestinian state," he added.</p>
<p>Earlier Arafat's spokesman Marwan Kanafani said that Arafat, who arrived in Tunis on Friday, would fly to Gaza immediately after meeting Ben Ali, where he was expected to chair a cabinet meeting of the Palestinian self-rule Authority.</p>
<p>But Arafat instead went to his Tunis headquarters where he lived in exile for 10 years until returning to Gaza following the 1993 Palestinian-Israeli peace deal.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials said Arafat headed a meeting with Tunis-based Palestinian leaders still in exile and was to leave later on Friday. Arafat was in Rabat on Thursday where he met U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross.</p>
