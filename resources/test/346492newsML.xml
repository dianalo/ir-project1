<p>The Polish Securities Commission (KPW) said it cleared the purchase of a 9.99-percent stake in Prochnik SA garment maker by National Investment Fund (NFI) "Piast" and allowed it to up its stake beyond 25 percent.</p>
<p>"The Securities Commission has not objected to a National Investment Fund Piast plan to buy shares giving it more than 25 percent of votes in...Prochnik," the commission said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>Piast agreed to buy, at 11 zlotys per share, less than 10 percent of Prochnik shares from a 25-percent Prochnik stake which had been held by the Westa insurance company and which went into receivership after Westa's bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The president of NFI 12 Rafal Zagorny told a news conference on Friday the fund was likely clinch the deal with Westa receiver in a bourse kerb transaction in the next few days and said the fund might later consider raising the stake in Prochnik.</p>
<p>"If this (the KPW approval) is confirmed we may think about it... we will see," Zagorny said, when asked whether the fund would buy the whole 25-percent batch.</p>
<p>Zagorny was speaking before the commission's statement was released.</p>
