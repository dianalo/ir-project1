<p>Lyondell Petrochemical Co's joint venture with Millennium Chemicals Inc aims to cut costs ahead of an expected downturn in a notoriously cyclical industry.</p>
<p>The companies aim to save $150 million annually from a venture which will have 4.2 percent of the global ethylene market, 5.9 percent of the global polyethylene market and one percent of the polypropylene market.</p>
<p>"This venture will make us stronger going into the next trough," said Dan Smith, Lyondell's chief executive.  </p>
<p>Lyondell's second quarter earnings, also released today, showed that the polymers business had its best-ever quarter and that its petrochemicals business benefitted from lower oil prices, but analysts say that ethylene and polyethylene are headed for the doldrums on the back of new capacity.</p>
<p>Smith said that the venture, which will be 57 percent owned by Lyondell and 43 percent by Millennium, will also generate $100 million in one-time cost savings, largely due to reduced investment in an ethylene cracker which both companies had planned with Union Carbide Corp.  </p>
<p>"This is an excellent move by both companies," said Frank Mitsch, analyst at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>The venture will have assets of $5.0 billion, with Lyondell contributing 3.8 billion pounds of ethylene plant, 2.2 billion pounds of polypropylene and two billion pounds of polymer resins.  Millennium will bring 3.8 billion pounds of ethylene and 4.8 billion pounds of polymers.</p>
<p>Millennium will receive $1.0 billion from the exchange, which chief executive William Landuyt said he plans to use to expand more profitable areas of Millennium's business, such as titanium dioxide or acetyls.  </p>
<p>Asked whether he would look at buying the North American titanium dioxide business of Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries Plc, which was not part of ICI's deal with DuPont Co, Landuyt said the business was attractive and he would look at it.</p>
<p>Lyondell's Smith said the joint venture, which follows a refining venture with the CITGO part of Venezuela's state oil company, would free money up for Lyondell to expand more profitable businesses, or possibly to buy back shares.  </p>
<p>Analysts note that ethylene capacity is being ramped up in the U.S. and globally, and that from 1998, a lot of new capacity will come onstream.</p>
<p>PaineWebber estomates that 2.3 million metric tonnes of ethylene capacity will be added this year, bringing capacity to 30.7 million metric tonnes, and this will rise to 35.4 million by the end of the year 2000.</p>
<p>Worldwide, capacity is set to grow by 6.3 million tonnes to 74.7 million by the end of this year and to 93.7 million by end-2000.  </p>
<p>Millennium shares had traded as high as 22-3/16 after the announcement, but settled at 21-1/2, up 11/16, in late trading.  Lyondell was up 1/2 at 26, having been as high as 27.</p>
<p>Titanium dioxide is cyclical, but its markets are characterized as having fewer competitors and dynamics more favorable than petrochemicals markets.  Also, the outlook for TiO2 is for cyclical recovery coming off weak trough conditions in 1996.</p>
