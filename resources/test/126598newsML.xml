<p>COMMENTS - Singapore bunker levels on Friday ended steady from Thursday, traders said. While enquries were healthy, transacted volumes were limited, a trader at a major said. "Shipowners were just testing the waters," he said. Another independent was heard to have sold to a Japanese shipowner 2,000 tonne of 180-cst supplies at $125.50. MDO and gasoil prices held steady on thin demand.-- Singapore newsoom (65-870-3082).</p>
