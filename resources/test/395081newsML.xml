<p>Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, officially the world's oldest person, quietly celebrated her 122nd birthday on Friday with close friends and a chocolate cake at a retirement home in the Provencal town of Arles.</p>
<p>"One hundred and twenty-two years. Can anyone beat that?" she gloated ahead of the big event.</p>
<p>"I sleep like a baby," she told the newspaper Le Figaro, responding to questions shouted into her right ear.</p>
<p>Though she looked a bit older and a bit thinner than at her last birthday, Calment nonetheless has kept her sense of humour and has the heart -- and peace of mind -- of a far younger woman, according to her doctors.</p>
<p>She has been on earth longer than films, telephones, cars and airplanes. Thirty years older than Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who died on Wednesday, she was already 18 at the birth of Mao Zedong, who died in 1976, aged 82.</p>
<p>Though blind, virtually deaf and confined to a wheelchair, she retains a good appetite and has her hair done once a week.</p>
<p>But her doctors, anxious to protect the increasingly frail "Doyenne of Humanity" from exploitation as she sets new longevity records with every heartbeat, barred lavish public festivities such as those of last year, when she turned 121.</p>
<p>The doctors acted after a court in Arles last month ordered her placed under legal guardianship, concluding she could no longer fend for herself and needed "to be counselled, supported and protected from the upsets that her fame can cause."</p>
<p>The turning point apparently came last year when she approved the sale of a compact disc entitled "Mistress of Time" that featured her talking to a background of funk-rap, techno and dance music.</p>
<p>The pop star aura seemed a jolt for Calment, whose favourite music includes Bizet's opera Carmen, first performed in 1875, the year of her birth.</p>
<p>So this year, instead of a media event, she quietly nibbled at a chocolate cake surrounded by old friends and co-residents of the Maison du Lac retirement home in Arles, the town where she has always lived and once met Vincent van Gogh as a girl.</p>
<p>The Guinness Book of Records lists Calment as the oldest person who ever lived -- and has a birth certificate, dated February 21, 1875, to prove the claim. It says other rivals for the longevity crown lack documentation.</p>
<p>They include a former Brazilian slave, Maria do Carmen Geronimo, who celebrated a 125th birthday last March.</p>
<p>Calment's cheerful sense of humour has won her fame as much as her longevity. A long-time smoker who enjoys a glass of port, Calment has said a smile is her recipe for long life.</p>
<p>"I've only ever had one wrinkle and I'm sitting on it," she once remarked. "I will die laughing," she has predicted.</p>
<p>Born into a well-to-do family 10 years after the assassination of U.S. president Abraham Lincoln and four years before the birth of scientist Albert Einstein, she has never had to work for a living.</p>
<p>She married in 1896 and her husband, Fernand Calment, died in 1942 -- four years before their golden wedding anniversary. "Queen Jeanne" has outlived all her descendants. Her daughter died in 1934 and her grandson, a doctor, in 1963.</p>
