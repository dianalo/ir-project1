<p>An Arab human rights leader on Thursday told activists from around 30 Arab countries that they did too little compared to what oppressed people expected of them, and needed new initiatives.</p>
<p>"What has been achieved so far is too little compared to what oppressed people expect in the Arab World," Adib al-Jadir, the president of the Arab Organisation for Human Rights (AOHR), said.</p>
<p>He was addressing the fourth public assembly of the group being held in the Moroccan capital, Rabat.</p>
<p>Jadir urged the organisation's leadership not to stand in the way of young people who were needed to bring fresh ideas to advance human rights.</p>
<p>"Every leadership should renew itself and allow young, dynamic people, who will live mainly in the next century, to enrich it with new initiatives," he added.</p>
<p>Earlier this month in Cairo, the group issued its report in which it said human rights in the Arab world had worsened in 1996 because of a "triangle of violence" caused by foreign aggression, internal conflicts and the war between governments and Moslem militants.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Mohamed Aouad, an adviser to Morocco's King Hassan, told the session that he deplored the absence of a human rights collective convention in the Arab world and the situation of Palestinians.</p>
<p>"The Arab world so far has not agreed on a collective human rights convention...and Israel still violates human rights in complete contradiction with international law," he said.</p>
<p>AOHR held its meeting in Morocco at the invitation of the Moroccan Human Rights Organisation.</p>
