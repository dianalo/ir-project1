<p>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp, the world's largest credit rating agency, said on Tuesday it would team up with a Brazilian economic think tank to rate debt instruments issued in the Brazilian market.</p>
<p>S&amp;P President Leo C. O'Neill said the rating agency, a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos Inc, had signed a cooperation agreement with the Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas Foundation, one of Brazil's most respected economic institutes.  </p>
<p>"We can provide analytical tools and we can provide training, but we believe the work is best done by the people that are connected to and committed to the local marketplace," O'Neill told reporters at a news conference.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, S&amp;P would continue to rate Brazilian debt issued in global markets and would help Getulio Vargas set up standards to rate Brazilian debt issued domestically.</p>
<p>Getulio Vargas will probably use S&amp;P's current 'AAA' to 'D' scale as a guide to set up a domestic rating's scale, which was expected to look a bit different from S&amp;P's.  </p>
<p>Although the current agreement does not set up a joint venture between the two groups, O'Neill said he hoped that by the end of the year S&amp;P and Getulio Vargas would formalize their partnership and create a new Brazilian rating agency.</p>
<p>There are now about three or four small rating agencies in Brazil, most of whom have partnerships with U.S. rating agencies.</p>
<p>Both S&amp;P and Getulio Vargas are banking on an enormous growth in local debt issuance by Brazilian companies as interest rates fall and the economy stabilizes under a two-year-old inflation-slashing drive.  </p>
<p>Traditionally, Brazilian firms have been timid debt issuers, especially compared to their counterparts in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>"But investment needs are growing in Brazil and we believe firms will become more comfortable issuing debt as the economy continues to stabilize and inflation remains under control," said Antonio Salazar, a director at Getulio Vargas.</p>
<p>Salazar said local pension funds, which will be entrusted with more and more money as low inflation teaches Brazilians the art of savings, would make up the bulk of its clientele over the next few years.  </p>
<p>Brazil is the fourth Latin American country, after Mexico, Chile and Argentina, where S&amp;P has established partnerships to evaluate credit risk at the local level.</p>
<p>Although U.S. competitors Duff &amp; Phelps Credit Rating Co and Fitch Investors Service have already established partnerships with Brazilian agencies, O'Neill said S&amp;P was not late in arriving to Brazil.</p>
<p>"There is an expression in the United States that says: "Second one on the beach, first one in the water. That is what we are doing in Brazil," he said.</p>
<p>Moody's Investors Service Inc, S&amp;P's chief competitor worldwide, does not currently operate in Brazil on its own or through a partner.</p>
<p>O'Neill said he would travel to Buenos Aires this week, where he will announce S&amp;P's acquisition of Risk Analysis, Argentina's largest credit rating firm.</p>
