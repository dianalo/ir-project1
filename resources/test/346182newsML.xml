<p>Ricky Pierce scored 25 points and LaPhonso Ellis had 11 of his 23 in the fourth quarter as the Denver Nuggets overcame 48 points by Hakeem Olajuwon for a 113-109 victory over the Houston Rockets on Thursday.</p>
<p>Dale Ellis had 20 points and Ervin Johnson grabbed 15 rebounds for Denver.</p>
<p>Olajuwon didn't attempt a free throw and made 24 field goals.</p>
<p>"I kept waiting for a foul and when I asked, they (the officials) said they would call one when they saw one," said Olajuwon, who made just one basket in the final 8:32.  "I took good shots, but they rolled in and rolled out. That's basketball."</p>
<p>Olajuwon's 24 field goals without a free throw is believed to match an NBA all-time high established by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of the Milwaukee Bucks on January 25th, 1973. Wilt Chamberlain and Alex English each made 22 field goals without a free throw.</p>
<p>In Dallas, Sam Mitchell scored 21 points and the Minnesota Timberwolves used a pair of 7-0 bursts two minutes apart and beat the Dallas Mavericks for the sixth straight time, 92-82.</p>

<p>Chris Gatling had 29 points and 18 rebounds for Dallas.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, Lov Vaught scored 20 of his 28 points in the second half as the Los Angeles Clippers sent the reeling Vancouver Grizzlies to their seventh consecutive loss, 100-94.</p>
<p>Vaught, who had 11 rebounds, recorded his 25th double double of the season for the Clippers. Darrick Martin added 13 and Malik Sealy had 12.</p>
<p>Bryant Reeves led Vancouver with 25 points.</p>
