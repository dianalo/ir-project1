<p>U.S. credit markets are seen keeping their current optimism, but most analysts see little chance the market will break technical barriers and jump into new bullish territory.</p>
<p>"There is nothing in the reports next week which should be able to break current resistance levels on the (benchmark) Treasury bond," said Cary Leahey, senior economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Resistance has been seen in the area between 6.43 and 6.42 percent in terms of yields for the 30-year Treasury bond.</p>
<p>Market focus will range from fresh Treasury supply early in the week to the release of a new batch of second-tier data, including housing starts, international trade and the monthly Philadelphia Federal Reserve survey.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Treasury will offer $18.25 billion in two- year notes. The sale will be followed by another auction of $12.5 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday (November 20).</p>
<p>"In the early part of the week we'll have the auctions... and it looks like we're just getting a little bit of a pullback ahead of that," said Lee Youngdahl, economist and vice-president at Aubrey G. Lanston Co and Inc.</p>
<p>Treasuries dropped on Friday mostly on profit-taking, with the benchmark 30-year bond down about half a point in late trade at 100-17/32. Its yield was at 6.46 percent.</p>
<p>The market will also take in housing starts and permits for the month of October on Tuesday at 0830 EST/1330 GMT. In a Reuters survey, Wall Street economists expect starts to rise to 1.443 million in October against 1.438 million earlier.</p>
<p>Economists will also pay special attention to the release of international trade for September. The report is expected to show a deficit of $9.5 billion against a $10.83 billion in the previous month.</p>
<p>"You'll get trade balance on Wednesday...which will refine people's third quarter GDP revision forecast. It might also have some implications for a narrower trade gap in the fourth quarter, which may help growth," Leahey said.</p>
<p>Still on the economic front, the market will learn about the Philadelphia Federal Reserve survey for November, which is expected to drop slightly to 5.0 against 5.3 in October.</p>
<p>The market will also take its cues from other markets, mainly foreign exchange. Analysts said Treasuries are likely to respond to any sharp fluctuation of the dollar against either the D-mark or the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>"Players will look at related markets as well...The market next week is likely to be more technically oriented," said a money trader at a U.S. investment bank.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Federal Reserve added reserves to the money market via over-the-weekend system repurchase agreements when fed funds were quoted at 5-3/4 percent, well above the central bank's target for the rate.</p>
<p>Federal funds are seen opening at 5.31 percent on Monday.</p>
