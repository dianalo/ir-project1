<p>Irish May inflation is expected to show a slight acceleration when the consumer price index data is published on Thursday, economists said on Monday.</p>
<p>Economists, who are forecasting a rise of 0.3 to 0.4 percent in May, up from a rise of 0.1 percent month on month in April, said a bad figure may prompt a brief knee-jerk reaction in the market but was unlikely to cause any major impact.</p>
<p>Year-on-year forecasts range from a rise of 1.5 to 1.6 percent compared with a rise of 1.4 percent for the 12 months to May 1996.</p>
<p>"Minutes after it is published the market may tick up or down depending on the figure but I do not think this will be of earthquake proportions by any stretch of the imagination," Ulster Bank economist Eoin Fahy said.</p>
<p>Fahy is forecasting a 0.4 rise month-on-month and a year-on-year rise of 1.6 percent while Bloxham stockbrokers economist Alan McQuaid is going for a rise of 0.3 percent on the month and 1.6 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>McQuaid said competition was working to keep inflation down, "...mortgage rates are going to go up which will push the headline figure up, but I still think it will be really subdued".</p>
<p>Fahy warned that the market cannot continue to be surprised on the downside as it was for the first four months of the year when the inflation number consistently came in under forecast.</p>
<p>"The longer the year goes on the weaker the Irish pound exchange rate is against sterling and the more likely that a negative surprise is going to come through and I am taking a guess that in a small way it may come through this month," Fahy said.</p>
<p>Some economists felt that while prices in clothing and footwear were being kept down partly, due to the influence of UK multiples, that some pickup in prices was likely, particularly given the weakness of the Irish pound.</p>
<p>"It is a general feeling that the ongoing good news cannot last. We have had this tremendous weakness in clothing prices which has been put down to the influence of the UK multiples that is reasonable as the extra level of competition is keeping prices down but again I am not sure how long it will last," Fahy said.</p>
<p>Economists also pointed to the difficulty that some services companies, such as supermarkets and fast food chains, are experiencing in getting staff. They said this sector may be forced ultimately to raise wages and that will eventually feed into higher prices.</p>
<p>McQuaid took comfort in the fact that the central bank revised its annual forecast for 1997 down to 1.8 percent from 2.3 percent in its recent annual report.</p>
<p>He said given the low CPI rates in the first four months of the year it could reach 2.0 to 2.5 percent in the second half of the year without reaching an average of 1.8 percent.</p>
