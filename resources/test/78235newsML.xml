<p>Hungarian hotel group Danubius will sign the agreement on Friday with the state privatisation agency APV Rt about the purchase of an 85 percent share package in Hungaria Szalloda Rt.</p>
<p>"APV's board approved the sale agreement between Danubius Rt and APV Rt over an 85 percent stake in (hotel chain) Hungaria Szalloda Rt and mandated APV's general director to sign the agreement" APV spokesman Adam Dudits told APV's weekly news conference.</p>
<p>"This will take place on September 27, 1996," he said.</p>
<p>Following the signing Hungary's Competition Agency will oversee the procedure. The agreement will go into affect after the agency's approval, which is to be followed by the payment of the purchase within 20 days after, Dudits said.</p>
<p>Danubius and APV agreed not to release further details, including on the payment terms.</p>
<p>Danubius, which will pay 8.125 billion forints for the stake, won Hungaria's privatisation tender in late August.</p>
<p>At 1009 GMT, Danubius shares stood at 3,015 forints, up 15, on the Budapest Stock Exchange.</p>
