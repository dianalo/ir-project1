<p>Thai stocks took a nosedive on Tuesday following an announcement by the Thai central bank that it has suspended more than half of its finance companies, while the baht remained relatively firm against the dollar.</p>
<p>Bank of Thailand governor Chaiyawat Wibulswadi told a news conference that the bank had suspended the operations of 42 finance companies, in addition to 16 already suspended.</p>
<p>The surprise announcement ignited hectic sales in the stock market as it added to worries over the already troubled financial sector.</p>
<p>By 0841 GMT, the market's benchmark SET index was down 2.41 percent to 647.85, after falling by over four percent to a low of 634.58.</p>
<p>"The market was falling heavily due to the announcement by the central bank on the suspension of more finance companies," Bumnam Liumsuwan of Asia Credit said.</p>
<p>The baht, meanwhile, erased some of its earlier gains after the suspension announcement triggered profit-taking. The Thai currency stood at around 31.70/32.00 to the U.S. dollar onshore after firming to about 31.30 earlier.</p>
<p>Traders said the suspension news had hurt the already bearish Thai stock market, which had been hit hard by the de facto devaluation of the baht on July 2.</p>
<p>The central bank governor said the bank also guaranteed debt repayments and deposits of the troubled companies. Thai finance companies have been struggling to cope with higher funding costs and deteriorating revenues in the face of the nation's worst economic crisis in over a decade.</p>
<p>Soon after the central bank announcement, the Stock Exchange of Thailand said it had suspended trading in 17 ailing finance companies.</p>
<p>The news of the suspension dampened optimism that a decision to accept the International Monetary Fund (IMF) support and to abide by the organisation's tough monetary and fiscal conditions would help extricate Thailand from its financial crisis.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya on Tuesday unveiled a series of tough measures aimed at boosting the economy with the goal of obtaining $12-$15 billion in loans from foreign countries and the IMF.</p>
<p>In addition to the suspension of the ailing finance companies, Thailand also set targets of maintaining $25 billion in foreign reserves, cutting the current account deficit, controlling inflation and hiking the value-added tax to 10 percent from current seven percent.</p>
