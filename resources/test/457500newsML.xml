<p>Norway's Rieber and Son said on Thursday that it now had over 50 percent of equity and votes in Danish roadbuilder Phoenix Contractors, a level at which it said earlier it would implement a takeover of the company.  </p>
<p>Rieber director Olav Daviknes confirmed that the 50 percent level was reached after his firm bought the Phoenix holdings of Danish pension funds ATP and LD.</p>
<p>He was not immediately able to give the precise number of shares bought.</p>
<p>Phoenix earlier said it had increased its stake to 35.9 percent of Phoenix equity and said it would implement a takeover if it could build a stake above 50 percent.</p>
<p>A February 28 analysis showed ATP holding 10.4 percent of Phoenix equity and LD owning 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>Codan Insurance later said it had sold Rieber its 11.4 percent of equity.</p>
<p>If the Feburary 28 figures still hold, Rieber, would have at least 60.7 percent.</p>
<p>Rival bidder Icopal said it was likely to give up the fight and sell Rieber its stake, last recorded as 11.23 percent. --Steve Weizman, Copenhagen newsroom +45 33969650</p>
