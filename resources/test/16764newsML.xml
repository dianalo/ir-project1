<p>CBOT corn futures closed higher on gains in soybean futures, traders said.</p>
<p>"Technically it was friendly but corn really just followed the six cent or better gains in beans," a trader said.</p>
<p>Trading was choppy throughout the session.</p>
<p>Conflicting weather signals and contrasts in estimates for this year's U.S. corn crop stirred interest but provided little direction.</p>
<p>"Pro Farmer does spark concern over crop size. People are starting to realize we may not be able to reach 9.0 billion," said Steve Bruce of E.D. and F. Man International.</p>
<p>Bruce referred to the Professional Farmers of America which Monday, estimated U.S. corn output for 1996 at 8.2 billion bushels.</p>
<p>That tally was well below USDA's forecast in August for 8.69 billion bushels.</p>
<p>But traders early Tuesday said a widely-followed private forecaster, said to have been on last week's crop tour of the Midwest, pegged the crop at 8.85 billion bushels.</p>
<p>The market also focused on a sharp break in the cash basis market and outlooks for cooler weather next week.</p>
<p>Corn closed unchanged to 1-1/2 cents per bushel higher, with September up 1/4 at $3.69-3/4.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated at 50,000, down from 74,250 Monday.</p>
<p>There was no outstanding feature in corn options with Farmers Commodities Corp seen buying 350 December $3.00 puts, Refco Inc bought 200 December $3.30 calls and Smith Barney bought 200 December $4.00 calls, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 17,000, down from 18,881 contracts Monday.</p>
