<p>German carmaker Mercedes-Benz AG said on Thursday that it had resumed production at two Spanish factories after truck drivers in Spain said on Wednesday they would end their strike.</p>
<p>"The production lines in Spain are running again," a Mercedes spokesman said.</p>
<p>Mercedes said production of about 1,000 of its V-Class transporters was affected by the week-long stoppage in production at a plant in Vitoria and also at a parts production plant in Barcelona.</p>
