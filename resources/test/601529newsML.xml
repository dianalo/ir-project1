<p>Leading Russian shares were mixed in late afternoon trade on Wednesday and the market should close little changed from Tuesday despite the U.S. decision not to raise interest rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>Market bellwether UES rose to $0.3219 at 1350 GMT from $0.3175 on Tuesday. Oil company Surgutneftegaz rose to $0.895 from $0.880 while regional electricity utility Mosenergo eased to $1.319 from $1.322.</p>
<p>"Even though all the world markets reacted fairly positively (to the U.S. interest rates news), the Russian market didn't go with them," siad United City Bank senior trader Samit Yakovlev.</p>
<p>"The information didn't add anything new to the market apart form optimism on the part of firms which aren't oriented towards client demand. Clients did not support that optimism."</p>
<p>Traders said they did not expect the market to repeat its performance of the last few days in the near future as the flow of funds into the market was not very aggressive.</p>
<p>"Even the last market rise in my opinion left something to be desired -- UES and (metals mining company) Norilsk Nickel pulled the whole market beind them," said Sergei Sheikov, Raiffeisenbank Austria's head of corporate trading.</p>
<p>"I don't think that there will be a significant inflow of funds right away tomorrow."</p>
<p>Norilsk was $7.25 after $6.89. Gas monopoly Gazprom GAZP.RTS rose to $6.12 from $6.00. A deputy energy minister said the price of Gazprom's domestic shares could eventually rise to the level of foreign-traded shares, allowing the two segments to merge, but only after the full nine percent quota had been sold to foreign investors. The ADS, equivalent to 10 underlying shares, was $18.30 after $18.80 in London.</p>
<p>Noyabrskneftegaz fell to $11.40 from $11.45 on May 19 after the company announced a rise in authorised but unissued capital to 30.85 trillion from 15.71 billion roubles. Noyabrskneftegaz preferred were $7.10 after $7.70 on May 14 after news of a fall in the dividend on preferred shares. No dividend is being paid on ordinaries.</p>
<p>UCB's Yakovlev said a recent fall in T-bill yields was not yet having a strong effect on the equity market but did not rule out such a development in the future.</p>
<p>He said demand for "blue chips" would become more and more differentiated.</p>
<p>"Companies like Mosenergo, Irkutskenergo and LUKoil are already played out," he said, naming UES, Surgutneftegaz, international long-distance telecom Rostelekom and metals mining concern Norilsk Nickel among companies where demand would continue.</p>
<p>He said expectations of a strategic investor in state telecoms holding company Svyazinvest was fueling demand for Rostelekom while Norilsk has risen steeply in past weeks on anticipation of ADRs and company restructuring.</p>
