<p>The family of Martin Luther King Jr. broke a 30-year silence about the civil rights leader's murder on Thursday, announcing that they want his confessed assassin to get a trial.</p>
<p>King's son Dexter told a news conference he intended to meet with Ray, who is serving a 99-year prison sentence for the April 4, 1968 killing, to hear his story. The family is expected to petition a Tennessee judge to grant Ray a trial.</p>
<p>King said the family had finally decided to speak out because of the declining health of the 68-year-old Ray. He said only a trial would be able to answer lingering questions about his father's death.</p>
<p>"Not allowing justice to run its course in this case would compound the tragedy for our family and for all concerned. Only a duly conducted trial can shed light on Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination," he said.</p>
<p>"James Earl Ray ... pled guilty to this crime on the advice of his attorney at the time. He recanted his plea a few days later and asked for a trial, which has been denied him to this day.</p>
<p>"The lack of satisfactory resolutions to questions surrounding the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. has been a source of continuing pain and hardship to our family. Every effort must be made to determine the truth. We feel strongly that can only be accomplished in a court of law."</p>
<p>Ray began serving his prison term after he confessed to shooting King on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, where the civil rights leader was visiting to support striking garbage workers. Ray, now suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, later recanted his confession, saying he was the victim of a conspiracy and did not shoot King.</p>
<p>His confession spared him a trial and a possible death penalty. Shelby County criminal court in Memphis will consider his request for a trial at a Feb. 20 hearing that Dexter King said he would attend.</p>
<p>King, who directs the centre for nonviolent studies that bears his father's name, told the Atlanta Constitution recently that his family now may be able to cope with the pain of reopening old emotional wounds.</p>
<p>"I don't think his trial -- if he is granted a trial -- will necessarily give us the unequivocal truth," King was quoted as saying last week. "But at least, in regard to new evidence, we will know more than we do now."</p>
