<p>In the universe of breathhold diving, the spotlight falls on Pipin Ferreras on Sunday, when he attempts to set a world record by going down into the water 135 meters (445 feet) while holding his breath.</p>
<p>Ferreras takes a "because it's there" attitude to his unusual livelihood, in which he makes his money from corporate sponsorships. At a news conference on Saturday, he likened it to a bull fight, where "sometimes the bullfighter wins, and sometimes the bull wins."</p>
<p>"Why do people propose going to Mars?" said Ferreras, 34. "My challenge is to discover what is the aquatic capacity of the human being. I have a right to know."</p>
<p>It is a far cry from his past life as a spear fisherman in Cuba, making friendly bets with tourists that he could swim to unthinkable depths without the benefit of scuba gear.</p>
<p>But Ferreras has always been a sort of fish out of water in this sport, in the past dominated by the Italian and French. When he set a world record of 130 meters at this Mexican resort last March, it was the first time the record had been set in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>"He comes from the people," Kim McCoy, a physical oceanographer from San Diego, California, who is part of the team monitoring Ferreras, told Reuters. "He doesn't have the same background as the Europeans competing in this sport."</p>
<p>The current record of 131 meters is held by Humberto Pellizare of Italy, who eclipsed Ferreras's record in June.</p>
<p>Competitors in the sport descend a cable with the aid of a weight and ascend with an inflatable balloon. Competition began in 1949, when divers who once planted mines on Nazi submarines decided to make a sport of it, Ferreras said.</p>
<p>On Sunday, he will wear a wetsuit and carry a sensor that monitors his depth and the ocean temperature.</p>
<p>Ferreras said he stumbled onto the sport by accident while trying to make a living along Havana's famous boardwalk, diving for fish with a speargun. The deeper the dive, the bigger the fish, and Ferreras was always known for coming back with the biggest fish.</p>
<p>One day some Soviet and Cuban scientists studying the effects of heavy G-forces on MiG jet fighter pilots wanted to compare the effects on underwater divers. Ferreras became their guinea pig, and through the experiments discovered competition.</p>
<p>Pressure under water is measured in "atmospheres," not G or gravity forces. If Ferreras reaches 135 meters, he will feel the pressure of 14.5 atmospheres.</p>
<p>Asked how he can stand it when amateurs feel their heads implode at three meters, Ferreras said, "I don't even know myself."</p>
<p>He said his acumen probably started when he was a toddler and was slow in learning to walk and talk. His parents enrolled him in aquatic therapy and he said at two years old he learned to walk and swim at the same time.</p>
<p>Despite becoming a champion in the sport and winning the privileges that top athletes earn in Communist Cuba, he defected in 1993 out of "insecurity" and today lives in Miami.</p>
<p>"Those privileges you could have today but they could disappear tomorrow," he said.</p>
