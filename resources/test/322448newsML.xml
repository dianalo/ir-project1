<p>Discussion on European Monetary Union will be a key theme at this year's World Economic Forum of political and business leaders in Davos, officials said.</p>
<p>"The common currency and its chances for implementation will come up at a number of sessions," Forum Executive Director Claude Smajda told reporters.</p>
<p>Key figures taking part in the Forum from January 30 to February 4 will include European Commission President Jacques Santer, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Spain's Finance Minister Rodrigo Rato.</p>
<p>Also there will be French Economy and Finance Minister Jean Arthuis, Belgium's Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, and German Finance Minister Theo Waigel, Smajda told a news conference.</p>
<p>Among leading European bankers taking part in Forum sessions would be Jean-Claude Trichet, Governor of the Bank of France, Howard Davies, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England.</p>
<p>German Bundesbank President Hans Tietmayer, a regular figure at the annual gathering of world business and political leaders, will not be going this year because of a scheduling problem, Smajda said.</p>
<p>But he would be replaced by his deputy, Johann-Wilhelm Gaddum. Also there would be Philippe Maystadt, Finance and External Trade Minister of Belgium.</p>
<p>Smajda said the discussions would focus on the timetable and the "likely realisation" of a single European currency by the 1999 deadline.</p>
<p>Other key financial figures attending the Forum include U.S. Deputy Treasure Secretary Lawrance Summers, and Akira Nagashima, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan.</p>
<p>Maystadt and Yves-Thibault de Silguy, European Commissioner in  charge of monetary affairs, will take part in a Forum debate on February 1 on the implications of the single currency for business.</p>
<p>Later the same day, Arthuis, Clarke, Dehaene and Rato will form a panel discussing the impact of the single currency on European economic competitiveness on the global stage.  (Geneva newsroom - (41-22) 733-38-31).</p>
