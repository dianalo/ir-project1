<p>The Indian state of Andhra Pradesh is negotiating 20 billion ringgit ($8 billion) of infrastructure deals with Malaysian firms and the government, eager to learn from their success, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said Andhra Pradesh's chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, on a four-day tour of Malaysia, had signed memoranda of understanding with firms for road construction, port development, education, information technology and power projects.</p>
<p>"The response from Malaysian industry has been unprecedented," India's Deputy High Commissioner to Malaysia Deepak Vora told Reuters.</p>
<p>Naidu is leading a delegation of around 30 industry representatives and other officials from his state on the visit to seek investment and "lessons in development" from this fast-growing country.</p>
<p>He said he turned down a shot at India's top job last month to push for the industrialisation of his largely backward state.</p>
<p>"I was asked by my coalition colleagues to stand as a neutral candidate. But, I had my commitments to my state and the development programmes I have started," the 45-year-old leader said in an interview.</p>
<p>Naidu's Telugu Desam party is part of India's ruling 15-party coalition. He says he rejected a coalition request to contend for the Indian premiership after the incumbent lost a parliamentary vote of confidence.</p>
<p>"Fifteen years ago, Malaysia had similar conditions as India. I am planning to (implement the) same model (of development) in India," he said.</p>
<p>"I believe information technology is everything, money, knowledge, wealth.</p>
<p>"I want to bring in administrative reforms through information technology and I want to privatise all things including services (to make them) more efficient," he added.</p>
<p>But Naidu faces an uphill task in convincing a bureaucracy and an electorate more used to welfare programmes of previous socialist governments. India started opening its economy in 1991.</p>
<p>"To start with I am balancing welfare with development. After some time I will give more priority for development. People will have more purchasing power and will be able to survive," he said.</p>
<p>Naidu said other deals expected to be finalised with Malaysian firms were a 500 megawatt power project, the expansion and modernisation of Andhra Pradesh's Visakhapatnam port and a 5.0 billion rupee ($140 million) trade and convention centre.</p>
<p>He has met several senior government ministers, including Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, since arriving on Sunday.</p>
<p>Bina Puri Holdings Bhd announced on Tuesday it has signed a joint-venture agreement with an Indian company, Madhucon Projects Ltd, to build flyovers in Andhra Pradesh state capital, Hyderabad, and a 75-km (47-mile) highway in the state.</p>
<p>Bina Puri's Indian projects are worth 120 million ringgit.</p>
