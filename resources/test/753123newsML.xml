<p>The U.S. House defeated, 150-277, on Thursday a proposal to eliminate funding in fiscal 1998 for the Agriculture Department's Market Access Program.</p>
<p>MAP was authorized at $90 million a year.</p>
<p>Critics said MAP, which provides cost-sharing funds for market development, was a wasteful form of corporate welfare.</p>
<p>Defenders like California Democrat Vic Fazio said MAP was vital in combatting subsidies offered by other nations.</p>
<p>"We continue to find in crop after crop, subsidies push our farmers out of markets," said Fazio.</p>
<p>MAP funding generally goes to consumer-ready and high-value products like wine, fish, fruits and vegetables.</p>
