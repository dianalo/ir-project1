<p>Kent became the first county side to book a Benson and Hedges Cup quarter-final place as rain delayed several of their rivals on Monday.</p>
<p>Kent, chasing 224 to beat British Universities, were under pressure on 99 for five before Gold Award winner Nigel Llong intervened with a match-winning 75 to ensure a four-wicket win.</p>
<p>Essex also escaped the wet weather to move to the top of their group, captain Paul Prichard and Australian Stuart Law dishing out some heavy punishment to Somerset's bowlers.</p>
<p>Set 270 to win, the home side romped home by eight wickets with 7.2 overs to spare, Law making 88 from 89 balls and Prichard cracking a career-best 114.</p>
<p>Surrey look well-placed to qualify as well after a thumping 165-run victory over Hampshire at Southampton. The home side were bundled out for just 63 with Joey Benjamin taking four for 19.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Sussex kept their hopes of qualification alive with a 34-run success over Gloucestershire, but rain forced five other matches into a second day on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Among the unfinished games was Ireland's visit to Wales to face Glamorgan in Cardiff. South African captain Hansie Cronje was unbeaten on 30 in his new side's 74 for three from 20.5 overs when play was finally halted for the day.</p>
