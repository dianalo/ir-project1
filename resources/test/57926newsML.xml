<p>South Africa's parliamentary finance committee on Tuesday adopted a bill that prepares the way for the eventual lifting of exchange controls on insurance companies.</p>
<p>Despite the misgivings of one or two African National Congress members, the committee passed the Insurance Amendment Bill which would allow insurers with limited reserves to invest offshore, once controls are relaxed.</p>
<p>Financial Service Board deputy registrar F.C. ("Oppies") Opperman said the bill provided control measures for the industry should the central Reserve Bank choose to liberalise exchange controls on insurance companies.</p>
<p>"For prudent investment purposes...we have laid down guidelines that, should the Reserve Bank open up investments outside the country, we have controlling measures in place," Opperman said.</p>
<p>The present Insurance Act states that companies must hold enough in South African assets to cover all their liabilities. This meant that life insurers could only invest overseas to the extent that they had free reserves.</p>
<p>"If they have very little in free reserves, then the Reserve Bank's concessions help very little because they cannot invest their policy holders' funds offshore," Old Mutual chief actuary Theo Hartwig told the committee.</p>
<p>"So the proposal is in effect to commit a limited amount of South African liabilities to be backed by offshore assets. It is consistent with what is normally permitted...in other countries," Hartwig said.</p>
<p>Hartwig said that the benefit of this would be that policyholders would also enjoy the benefit of spreading their investments more widely and not restricting them purely to South African investments.</p>
<p>ANC MP Mawalal Ramgobin expressed concern about the move saying that insurance companies should instead be encouraged to invest in the country to meet its huge developmental needs.</p>
<p>"I am surprised at this over-bearing insistence...that it is in the policyholders' interests to invest abroad," he said.</p>
<p>Democratic Party finance spokesman Ken Andrew said that Ramgobin's stand conflicted with the government's macro-economic strategy which reiterated the government's commitment to the eventual lifting of exchange controls.</p>
<p>The bill also aims to prohibit the publication of "misleading or undesirable" advertisements for insurance products, allow long-term insurers to underwrite the business of registered medical schemes and the appointment nominee companies abroad to handle asset swaps for insurance companies.</p>
