<p>Hundreds of Islamic activists demonstrated in Dhaka on Friday in protest against what they said was Bangladesh's "unpatriotic" plan to buy electricity from India.</p>
<p>"This is an unpatriotic plan ... We will resist until we shed our last drop of blood," said A.Z.M. Hemayetuddin, vice-persident of the Islamic Constitution Movement.</p>
<p>He added that the deal could have other consequences, with India possibly seeking to revive a proposal to buy natural gas from Bangladesh in return and securing land transit rights to transport the gas.</p>
<p>His remarks echoed warnings by the country's main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which said the prospective deals with India might endanger Dhaka's independence and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said last week Bangladesh was ready to buy electricity from anyone who could provide it at competitive prices and on reasonable terms.</p>
<p>She said the country needed a secure power supply, if it was to encourage foreign investment.</p>
<p>Government officials said India would be the most likely supplier of power but they did not know of any payment proposals.</p>
<p>On Thursday BNP Secretary-General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan urged Bangladeshis to prepare for a protest if the government entered into any "subservient" deal with India.</p>
<p>Dhaka is currently negotiating with New Delhi an agreement for sharing water from the river Ganges, called Padma in Bangladesh.</p>
