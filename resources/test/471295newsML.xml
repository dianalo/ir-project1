<p>Top seed Martina Hingis again displayed the form that is rocketing her to the top of women's tennis by soundly beating 10th seed Mary Joe Fernandez 6-4 6-1 in the quarter-finals of the Lipton Championships on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hingis, who will take over the number one ranking from injured Steffi Graf on Monday, raised her 1997 record to a perfect 24-0 in reaching the semifinals.</p>
<p>In a men's quarter-final, former French Open champion Sergi Bruguera of Spain blew away Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine 6-0 6-3 in a brief 53-minutes. Bruguera led 6-0 5-0 before Medvedev strung together three games.</p>
<p>"I think I cannot play better than 6-0, 5-0," said Burugera, who dropped a mere three points in the first set.</p>
<p>"I really didn't want to win 6-love, 6-love because he's a friend of mine," Bruguera said.</p>
<p>The 35th-ranked Spaniard, however, insisted he didn't give Medvedev any free points after going up 5-0 in the second. He said he just got a little ahead of himself.</p>
<p>"I was a little unable to concentrate," he said. "The next game I just was thinking to celebrate the victory, not to play the points."</p>
<p>It is highly unlikely Bruguera will have a chance for any premature celebrating when he plays his fourth semifinal of the year. The Spaniard next faces world number one Pete Sampras.</p>
<p>The top-seeded Sampras will be fresh for his meeting with Bruguera after reaching the semifinals on a walkover. His quarter-final opponent, Hendrik Dreekman of Germany, sprained an ankle walking to his hotel Tuesday night and was unable to play Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hingis should have faced a tougher test from the far more experienced Fernandez. Instead, the 16-year-old Swiss sensation swept aside the 12th-ranked American in 61 minutes.</p>
<p>Fernandez, who is teaming with Hingis in doubles this week, sang the teen titan's praises after the match.</p>
<p>"You have to play almost perfect tennis to beat her," Fernandez said. "Martina moves so well that it's hard for me to get her into trouble. She always knows where the ball is going. She knows how to read the point. She's very smart."</p>
<p>Hingis, who is looking for her fifth title in as many tournaments this year, next faces third seed Jana Novotna.</p>
<p>The fifth-ranked Czech veteran reached the final four earlier Wednesday by holding off eighth seed Iva Majoli of Croatia 6-2 3-6 7-6, taking the tense tie-break 9-7.</p>
<p>In the other women's semifinal, fourth seed Monica Seles plays 11th seed Barbara Paulus of Austria.</p>
<p>Hingis, who earned her first career Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January, did not mince words when asked if she was feeling unbeatable.</p>
<p>"Well, I am," she said with a laugh. "This year I am, right now. But it's kind of funny, everybody is expecting my first loss. I'm just trying to keep going and not to lose."</p>
<p>Even a supportive hometown crowd could not help push Fernandez past the teenaged phenom.</p>
<p>Both players had trouble from the service line in the early going as the first set featured seven service breaks.</p>
<p>After seven games, Fernandez was up a break and leading 4-3. That's when Hingis raised her game to another level entirely.</p>
<p>The top seed reeled off the next eight games, taking the first set and a commanding 5-0 lead in the second.</p>
<p>"Later on, I just played a great match," Hingis said. "It was the first time I really felt very confident in this tournament."</p>
