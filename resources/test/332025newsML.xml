<headline>Colombia strike not hitting coffee price - minister.</headline>

<p>Colombian Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia said labour unrest at the country's main coffee-loading port had not affected prices.</p>
<p>"I think the (high) price is due to the current market situation," she told Reuters during a visit to Brussels. "The port situation is not what is causing the price rise.</p>
<p>Robusta coffee futures have soared by nearly 16 percent this week but premiums for arabica -- Colombia's main crop -- have held steady on the back of a dock workers strike at Buanaventura port.</p>
<p>The strike ended on Thursday, nine days after stevedores stopped work to press for higher handling fees.</p>
<p>"I am glad to hear the strike is over, but hope prices will hold up still," said Mejia, in Brussels for trade talks with European Commission officials.</p>
