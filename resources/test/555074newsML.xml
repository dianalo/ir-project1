<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, hosting his Turkish counterpart, said he favoured joint military manoeuvres by the two countries and the United States, Turkey's Anatolian news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"I am of the view that the three countries holding joint manoeuvres would be of great benefit as far as strengthening the countries is concerned," Mordechai was quoted by state-run Anatolian as telling Turkish reporters in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>"We are making several initiatives on this subject," he said, noting that the United States already holds military operations separately with the Israeli and Turkish armies.</p>
<p>The visit by Turkish Defence Minister Turhan Tayan is part of increasing cooperation despite the election of Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan 16 months ago on a promise to cut growing security ties to the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Mordechai suggested there was further room to develop links.</p>
<p>"Israel, while being a small country, has many technological and scientific capabilities. It is possible to achieve very good results for the benefit of the two countries' peoples by uniting these," he said.</p>
<p>Tayan, from the secularist wing of Erbakan's coalition government, was to visit Israel Aircraft Industries, which is modernising Turkey's F-4 jet fighters. He is to return to Turkey on Friday.</p>
<p>Turkey and Israel signed defence cooperation agreements that drew objections from Iran and many in the Arab world. Israeli planes have flown training flights in Turkey under the accords.</p>
<p>Mordechai brushed aside opposition to the ties: "These countries are trying to ruin what is between us. My belief is that the two countries will not go along with this game."</p>
<p>Turkey's anti-Islamist army has pushed Erbakan's coalition with increasingly strident demands that he curb religious activism.</p>
