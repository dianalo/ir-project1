<p>Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov was knocked out in the first round of the Australian hardcourt tennis championships by Sweden's Mikael Tillstrom on Monday.</p>
<p>The Russian top seed said after his 6-2 6-2 defeat he no longer aimed to oust Pete Sampras from the top of the world rankings.</p>
<p>"Number one in the world is not a goal anymore. If it comes, it comes, but I'm not going to put myself under pressure," he said.</p>
<p>Kafelnikov won more matches on the ATP tour in 1996 than any other player and has risen to number three in the world rankings.</p>
<p>He was the only player in the world top 20 to enter the hardcourt tournament at Memorial Drive, a warm-up event for the Australian Open, but was easily beaten by Tillstrom, ranked 47th in the world.</p>
<p>Kafelnikov, who won the French Open title this year, is among the favourites for the first grand slam of 1997, starting in Melbourne on January 13.</p>
<p>In other matches on Monday, Zimbabwe's Byron Black, runner-up to Kafelnikov at the last Australian hardcourt championships, defeated Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen 6-4 6-3 to set up a second round meeting with Tillstrom.</p>
<p>Russia's Andrei Cherkasov, given a wildcard entry after a request by Kafelnikov, vindicated his presence by knocking out seventh seed Renzo Furlan of Italy 4-6 6-4 6-4.</p>
