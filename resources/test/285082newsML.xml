<p>Freezing weather gave strong support to NWE heating oil on Friday, but transport problems caused by iced-up canals and pipes curbed buying interest and prevented outright gains in differentials, traders said.</p>
<p>Benchmark Jan and Feb IPE futures shed $4.25 and $3.50 to $227.75 and $222.75 a tonne respectively on bearish U.S. stock data.</p>
<p>Heating oil refinery grade barges traded at Jan IPE +$2.50 for loading on Monday and at Jan IPE +$2 for loading on Tuesday, but material for mid-month went unchanged at +$1.25/+$1.50.</p>
<p>Low sulphur diesel was steady at around Jan IPE +$11/12.</p>
<p>Cargoes saw scattered buying into France and Germany. A 20,000 tonne refinery grade heating oil cargo traded at Feb IPE +$8.25 for Jan 10-20 cif Hamburg, around unchanged.</p>
<p>In cargoes, traders concentrated on trying to obtain heating oil and low sulphur diesel under arbitrage from the U.S. Gulf.</p>
<p>Two 60,000 tonne heating oil vessels were booked from the U.S. Gulf but traders said both had options for a variety of destinations apart from Europe. The arb to Asia remains closed.</p>
<p>A Wall Street trader was rumoured seeking to move Russian low sulphur diesel into Amsterdam.</p>
