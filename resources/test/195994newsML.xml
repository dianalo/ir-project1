<p>South African drugs group Adcock Ingram Ltd said on Monday that it needed more time to work out the final details of its restructuring following its recent merger with former rival Premier.</p>
<p>In a statement with its year results Adcock said it is still working out future manufacturing strategy in order to reap the maximum efficiency benefits from the tie-up.</p>
<p>"This is a complex issue and will require a little more time," said chief executive Phil Nortier.</p>
<p>Nortier added that substantial savings from the merger are anticipated over the next two years as a result of cost-savings and a unified structure. But he declined to give any exact figures.</p>
<p>Earlier the firm posted a 3.4 percent rise in headline earnings per share to 98.2 cents. The firm said this was due to a 107 percent increase in its share capital after the merger.</p>
<p>The group said the unified group would see stronger growth in the future. "The wider product portfolio, increased critical mass, as well as significant synergistic benefits are expected to lead to strong earnings growth in 1997 and beyond," the firm said.</p>
<p>The firm said the year results had seen strong sales growth in drug sales to both the private and public sectors. But it added its consumer healthcare operations had been hit by a slow-down in consumer spending.</p>
<p>The group's wholesale unit is still facing margins pressure and its performance was in line with the previous year, the firm said.</p>
<p>Adcock's international unit performed strongly and saw a 34 percent jump in exports, especially to other countries in Africa.</p>
<p>"The company expects continued strong growth in African markets and is adopting a more focused approach in its selection of international markets," the firm said.</p>
