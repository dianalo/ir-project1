<p>A deal between Yugoslavia and the London club of creditors is possible even without Belgrade regulating its status in the IMF first, the Tanjug news agency quoted a government official as saying on Friday.</p>
<p>The London club is expected to discuss a draft deal with Yugoslavia by the end of November, the Yugoslav chief negotiator and federal minister without portfolio, Vuk Ognjanovic told Tanjug.</p>
<p>"Along with our readiness to pay back debts, we now want new cooperation with memebers of the international banking community," Ognjanovic said, adding such a proposal would be in the form of a job offer to the banks.</p>
<p>Such an offer is in Yugoslavia's interest and will allow the country to create opportunities to service its foreign debt, the minister said.</p>
<p>According to Ognjanovic, Yugoslavia offered the London club a partial debt-for-equity swap.</p>
<p>He argued that once they are shareholders in Yugoslav companies, foreign creditors would naturally do everything to kick-start production and create opportunities for Yugoslavia to pay off its foreign debt.</p>
<p>Another chunk of the debt, not included in the debt-for- equity swap, would need to be reorganised, he said.</p>
<p>"We do not ask for debt write-off but for a realistic reduction of the debt," Ognjanovic was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The minister argued there was a need to review the way the interest rate is calculated.</p>
<p>He said Yugoslavia will also seek a grace period in servicing its debt, to provide breathing-space to give the country time to revive its economy and begin to service its debt.</p>
<p>Ognjanovic told Tanjug he hoped that in the meantime talks between Yugoslavia and the London club will resume.</p>
<p>The minister was not immediately available to confirm Tanjug's report, but a source close to the finance ministry told Reuters that the Yugoslav government offered to meet the London club creditors later this month in Belgrade.</p>
<p>"Those would be technical talks again, and an opportunity to present our fiscal, financial and development capacities and plans," the source said. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
