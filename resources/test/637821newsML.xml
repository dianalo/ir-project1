<p>Palladium prices exploded to new 17-year highs on Wednesday in a market severely squeezed by protracted delays in Russian supplies.</p>
<p>The gold market, however,  ignored the excitement in the platinum group metals (PGMs), as it did the German drama over plans to revalue gold reserves to qualify for European Monetary Union.</p>
<p>Palladium, a rare white metal used in electronics, catalytic converters and dentistry, fixed at $210 an ounce, the highest ever level since prices were first formally set in 1989.</p>
<p>By contrast its previous fix on Tuesday was $188.50.</p>
<p>"The market is extremely nervous about Russian deliveries. Palladium and platinum are much higher this morning even though there has really not being any fresh news," said analyst Hanspeter Hausheer of Swiss Bank Corp.</p>
<p>Platinum, its better-known sister metal, also jumped to fix at a new 16-month high of $425.00 an ounce, compared to the previous fixing of $406.50.</p>
<p>Both metals have soared since the start of the year - palladium is up 85 percent from year's low and platinum is up 25 percent - due to administrative delays in Russian supplies to key importer Japan.</p>
<p>Russia is the world's biggest producer of palladium and is second to South Africa in platinum output.</p>
<p>The latest price surge started late on Tuesday as dealers scrambled to cover short positions by borrowing or buying metal.</p>
<p>"Everyone and I mean everyone is a borrower. If there are no lenders around all you can do its borrow stuff at very high lease rates or buy material, which has been driving the price up," a dealer said.</p>
<p>"It has really started to bite now," he added, noting that one-month lease rates had rocketed to 90 percent or higher. In platinum, the rates were at around 50 percent.</p>
<p>The market would remain extremely volatile as fresh news emerges from ongoing supply talks between Russian exporter Almazjuvelirexport (Almaz) and Japanese consumers, dealers said.</p>
<p>Both metals whipsawed off highs ahead of the morning fixing on talk from Tokyo traders that Almaz officials had told Japaense clients exports were expected to begin around June 20.</p>
<p>In other precious metals markets, gold fixed at $342.40 an ounce, down $1.15 from the previous fixing and barely changed from Tuesday's closing level in London.</p>
<p>The silver market was similarly stolid at a virtually unchanged $4.74/$4.76. --London newsroom +44 171 542 2936</p>
