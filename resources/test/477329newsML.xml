<p>Pacific Gas and Electric Corp (PG&amp;E) said its 1,073 megawatt (MW) Diablo Canyon 2 nuclear power station automatically tripped off line Saturday.</p>
<p>In its report to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the San Francisco-based company said the unit tripped off line at 1057 PST Saturday due to "low water level in the number 2-2 steam generator."</p>
<p>The unit was listed by the NRC in its Monday daily plant status report as being in "mode 3 - hot standby", which would indicate a prompt restart is likely.</p>
<p>PG&amp;E, in its status report to the NRC, gave Tuesday, April 1, as the unit's likely restart date.</p>
<p>The company could not be immediately reached for confirmation of the estimated restart.</p>
<p>The unit, in Avila Beach, California, was operating at full power when it tripped off line.</p>
<p>The facility's neighboring unit, Diablo Canyon 1, is operating at full power. It is also rated at 1,073 MW.</p>
