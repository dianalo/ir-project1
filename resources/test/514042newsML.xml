<p>Sri Lanka stocks rose sharply to close 3.5 percent higher on Wednesday on active foreign buying due to improved investor sentiment, brokers said.</p>
<p>The all share index closed 23.19 points up at 689.09.</p>
<p>Price gains led declines by 83 to five. Aitken Spence &amp; Co rose nine rupees to 130.25, Bairaha Farms 1.25 to 16. Turnover was 200.4 million rupees on 5.9 million shares.</p>
<p>"Foreign investors are leading the buying after they saw that local sentiment has improved," said Dihan Dedigama, a trader at John Keells Stock Brokers.  </p>
<p>Local investor sentiment has been rising as companies are expected to see better growth in 1997 compared last year when power cuts hurt their bottomline, brokers said.</p>
<p>A cut in reserve ratios, falling interest rates and an agreement earlier this month between the government and the opposition party to work together to solve the ethnic conflict have added to the optimism, they said.</p>
<p>"The liquidity infusion after the Central Bank cut reserve ratios twice and falling fixed income interest rates have brought investors back to the market," said Gihan Rajapakse, a fund manger at CTC Eagle Fund Management.</p>
