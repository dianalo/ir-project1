<p>European oil products were mixed on Thursday with heavy fuel oil gaining up to $2, gasoline $1 but gas oil over $1 weaker.</p>
<p>Traders said physical high sulphur barges were concluded at $86.50 and $87, up from earlier talk of $85/86 and about $2 stronger than Wednesday. Dealers said there was no obvious reason for the gain, some suggested tight supply.</p>
<p>Gas oil was weaker with futures down about $1 a tonne and premiums under pressure from poor end-user demand, particuarly from Germany. Rotterdam refinery material was offered around June IPE +75 cents to $1.00 with bids around the flat level.</p>
<p>Gasoline was $1 or so stronger with a eurograde refinery material pegged around $205-206. A $202 deal was seen as weak. Regular was valued at $199.</p>
