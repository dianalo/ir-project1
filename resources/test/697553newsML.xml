<headline>Australian dlr gets sinking feeling as RBA looms.</headline>

<p>The Australian dollar suffered its lowest close for 17 months Monday and a singular failure to rally from an offshore setback warned of further losses ahead.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was generally short after Friday's 1/2 cent selloff swamped two-week old support, but all attempts to bounce were foiled by fresh overseas offers atop US$0.7460.</p>
<p>The local mood was characterised as "absolute indifference", partly due to the end of the financial year but mostly to utter uncertainty about what the Reserve Bank board will decide at its policy meeting Tuesday. Many think it will cut rates this week, others that it will delay, while some argue for no move at all.  </p>
<p>Whatever the pet theories of dealers and investors, none were ready to bet against the chance of a cut give the RBA had surprised with three of its four easings this cycle.</p>
<p>That reluctance found form in the dollar which at 4.45 pm (0645 GMT) was languishing at US$0.7453/58, the worst close since February 1 1996, having been capped by US$0.7461 all day.</p>
<p>The latest lapse came in New York hours Friday when U.S. investment bank selling finally cracked US$0.7480 support, sparking stop loss offers from every quarter of the globe.</p>
<p>The fall brought losses suffered since the last RBA rate cut on May 23 to 3-1/2 cents or 4.5 percent.  </p>
<p>It was also down on the crosses, although a steady US$/yen spared its blushes and limited the drop to 85.17/27 yen from 85.42/52 late here Friday. The currency had no such cushion against the Canadian dollar and sterling where recent hikes in Canadian and U.K. interest rates had left Australia as one of the few western countries still on an easing track.</p>
<p>How uncomfortable was seen in its trade weighted index which had eased another two basis points today at 56.7, to be 4.1 percent down on the level held before the May cut. That move had been a surprise and drew some scepticism at the time, but dire data since had seen money rates move to price in yet another.  </p>
<p>The 90-day bank bill contract for September had leapt to 94.84 from 94.45 just after the last official cut, implying a level of 5.16 percent against the 5.50 percent cash rate.</p>
<p>If the RBA board does decide to move the exact timing is problematic as the Federal Reserve holds a policy meeting of its own on Tuesday and Wednesday which might just result in a U.S. rate hike. Most of the market reckons the Fed will hold steady, but the RBA may think it safer to await confirmation before moving on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>May retail sales data are also out Wednesday and analysts are keen to see if the shock April dive was a rogue result.  </p>
<p>A very strong sales showing might stay the bank's hand while a soft result -- anything less than a 1.0 percent rise -- would merely confirm its easing bias.</p>
<p>If Friday came with no news, the market would assume an easing was on hold until inflation and wages data later in the month and the dollar could rally above 75 cents again.</p>
<p>Some argued a cut was not the inevitability the futures market thought since leading indicators of the economy were pointing to a pickup and the effect of past easings had yet to be felt in full. The recent fall in the currency had also been a de facto easing and further losses could threaten inflation.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately for dollar bulls the RBA was unlikely to come out and say the easing cycle was over, so uncertainty was set to dog the currency even if this week passed with no move.</p>
<p>Indeed, the market might have to wait until after the August 5 RBA board meeting to know for sure if interest rates had finally found a floor.</p>
<p>That prospect could keep the dollar capped at old US$0.7530 resistance and the currency would have to clear the big US$0.7630/7680 chart barrier to signal a clear reversal in the downtrend.</p>
