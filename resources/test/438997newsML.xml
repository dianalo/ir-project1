<p>Sudanese rebels said on Thursday they had captured the major town of Yei in southern Sudan and destroyed a division of up to 6,000 Sudanese government troops.</p>
<p>Yassir Arman, spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), said the rebels captured Yei, the biggest town in Western Equatoria region, on Wednesday after seizing Morobo army garrison.</p>
<p>Morobo is close to southern Sudan's borders with Zaire and Uganda.</p>
<p>He said SPLA forces besieged Lainya garrison, 100 km (60 miles) south of Juba and the south's biggest city, and on Thursday ambushed an army convoy between Juba and Lainya and fighting was continuing.</p>
<p>"The SPLA have destroyed in Kaya, Bazi, Morobo and Yei, a division of the NIF (National Islamic Front), which is about 5,000 to 6,000 men," said the rebel spokesman. He did not give rebel casualties.</p>
<p>Arman was speaking in the Eritrean capital Asmara, the headquarters for an alliance of Sudanese opposition groups.</p>
<p>A Sudanese government minister was quoted on Thursday as saying Sudan's troops crushed an attack by Ugandan forces in the south of the country, destroying tanks and causing a large number of casualties.</p>
<p>"The armed forces crushed attacking Ugandan troops in the Lanya area, destroying tanks, seizing arms and inflicting huge losses in lives," state radio quoted Culture and Information Minister Al-Tayeb Ibrahim Mohamed Khair as saying.</p>
<p>"The types of arms used confirm that Uganda has received foreign support."</p>
<p>Sudanese newspapers said Lanya was 100 km west of Juba and it was unclear if it was in fact the same place as the rebels said was Lainya garrison 100 km south of Juba.</p>
<p>Sudan has accused neighbouring Uganda of direct military involvement in attacks in southern Sudan since Sunday but the Ugandan government denied any involvement in a rebel offensive.</p>
<p>The SPLA said on Sunday they had captured the town of Kaya and were moving on Yei on the main road to the city of Juba.</p>
<p>The advances reported by the rebels on Sunday were the first indication for several weeks of progress in a rebel offensive launched in eastern Sudan in January which has spread to the south.</p>
<p>The SPLA led by John Garang has been fighting Khartoum since 1983, demanding greater autonomy for the mainly Christian and animist south of Sudan from the Moslem and Arabised north.</p>
<p>Uganda's government-owned New Vision newspaper said on Monday Ugandan troops had sealed off the border with south Sudan in the West Nile area and residents of northern Uganda heard battles inside Sudan.</p>
<p>Sudan has accused Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda of fighting alongside the rebels, who want to put pressure on the Khartoum government and spark a popular uprising to topple President Omar Hassan al-Bashir. The three states have denied any involvement.</p>
<p>Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said last month he might solve his problems with Sudan on the battlefield. Khartoum and Kampala accuse each other of sheltering and supplying rebels.</p>
