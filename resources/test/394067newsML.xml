<p>Chinese President Jiang Zemin, speaking publicly for the first time since the death of his mentor Deng Xiaoping, vowed on Friday to pursue the economic reforms which have turned China into a rising superpower.</p>
<p>"The Communist Party of China, the Chinese army and people of various ethnic groups are determined to turn grief into strength," Jiang told visiting Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev.</p>
<p>He pledged to "hold high the great banner of Deng's theory to build socialism with Chinese characteristics", the fig-leaf phrase the patriarch coined to justify such un-Marxist practices as private enterprise, ownership of property, lifting of price controls and revival of stock markets.</p>
<p>Deng's pragmatic reforms, grounded in the belief that China's people should be allowed to get rich, ended a decade of chaotic rule by Mao Zedong, who believed his people should be "red" -- communist. Jiang's remarks to Nazarbayev echoed almost word for word the formulation of the official obituary issued after Deng's death late on Wednesday at the age of 92.</p>
<p>However, it was Jiang's first personal and public commitment that he planned to press on with capitalist-style reforms that have transformed China from a backward Stalinist state to an economic powerhouse.</p>
<p>Jiang was the man chosen by Deng as his heir in 1989 after the political upheaval which accompanied the crushing of pro-democracy demonstrations centred on Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>Jiang, who combines the presidency with the post of Communist Party chief, vowed on Friday that China would unite to pursue Deng's reforms and opening up "unswervingly and confidently", the Xinhua news agency reported.</p>
<p>Memorial rites for the old man, China's unquestioned paramount leader since the late 1970s, are to take place in Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tuesday. In line with his last wish, his ashes will be scattered over the sea.</p>
<p>The death of Deng, who had withdrawn from the public eye years before, prompted few public displays of emotion in a land seemingly too absorbed with new material pursuits to grieve.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, authorities tightened security at sensitive sites in the capital ahead of the funeral rites.</p>
<p>In Tiananmen Square, the vast open space to the east of the Great Hall, witnesses saw a posse of policemen pounce on Friday on a lone man carrying a wreath and ribbon bearing Deng's name.</p>
<p>The police bundled him into a car along with his wreath, the witnesses said. The man's identity was unknown.</p>
<p>It was the second such incident within 24 hours. On Thursday police picked up a man as he walked past the imperial palace of China's emperors and into the square, carrying a placard with the words "Grandpa Deng, we cherish you", a witness said.</p>
<p>Three police quickly ushered him away.</p>
<p>Edgy Beijing authorities no doubt recall that in 1989, the last time China held a memorial for a Communist Party luminary in the Great Hall, 50,000 uninvited students massed silently in the square outside -- a bold act of dissent that swelled into the Tiananmen democracy protests.</p>
<p>That outcome, sparked by the death of disgraced former party chief Hu Yaobang, is something Beijing is clearly ready to go to extremes to prevent when 10,000 carefully chosen guests attend Deng's last rites at the hall next Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Supreme People's Court, the nation's top judicial body, ordered all courts to enforce laws strictly and safeguard social stability over the mourning period.</p>
<p>Another site sure to be heavily policed is the Communist Party's hallowed Babaoshan Cemetery, west of the capital, where Deng was expected to be privately cremated.</p>
<p>His funeral is to be a simple farewell: no overseas dignitaries, no foreign media, no lying in state -- and no tomb.</p>
<p>Two days after Deng's death, Beijing leaders remained largely out of sight, planning the funeral ceremonies and plotting career moves in the new political landscape.</p>
<p>Political analysts said the size of a 459-strong funeral committee led by Jiang Zemin hinted at arcane succession politics unchanged since the days when emperors ruled from the Dragon Throne of Beijing's Forbidden City.</p>
<p>By packing the committee with a political "who's who", the leadership was trying to send a signal of unity.</p>
<p>It also served to mask internal Communist Party machinations as key figures jockeyed for position before a key party congress in October when top posts and policies will be revealed.</p>
<p>An elite group might have displayed too hastily who is in and who is out.</p>
<p>In imperial China, social convulsions often accompanied the transfer of the "mandate of heaven" to a new emperor. While the latest power shift so far has been seamless, the analysts said later upheavals were possible.</p>
<p>Jiang, 70, must now defuse challenges from other aspirants to power, among them Qiao Shi, the former security tsar who now heads parliament, economic supremo Zhu Rongji and premier Li Peng. Shadowy figures as yet unknown in the outside world could be lurking in the wings.</p>
<p>State television in Taiwan, where current mainland developments are the subject of intense interest and analysis, quoted President Lee Teng-hui as saying that he was "not optimistic" about Jiang's succession. It did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China's propaganda machine went into overdrive, hailing diminutive Deng as a giant whose stature could never be matched and pledging the army's loyalty to his political heirs.</p>
<p>"Comrade Deng Xiaoping... became a great son of the people, a giant who will never be matched," the People's Daily said in a commentary. "The people of the motherland love and esteem him."</p>
<p>World leaders continued to sound more glowing tributes to the man who, in the words of Singapore elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew, had helped set the stage for China to become a superpower.</p>
<p>"He saved China," Lee wrote to Jiang. "Without him, China could have been like the Soviet Union. Instead China will become a huge heavyweight nation in 30 years."</p>
<p>Financial experts ruled out any immediate hiccups for the burgeoning economy. China chalked up growth of 9.7 percent last year and held once troublesome inflation to six percent, well below target and down sharply from more than 14 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>Other economists said reforms were unlikely to gather pace in the uncertain months before the party congress. But China had enough of an economic cushion that it could bide its time as it charted future change.</p>
