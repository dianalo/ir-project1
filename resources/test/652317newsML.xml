<p>Cy Young Award winner Pat Hentgen tossed his fourth complete game of the season and pinch-hitter Juan Samuel highlighted a five-run seventh inning with a three-run triple as the Toronto Blue Jays rallied for an 8-3 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Seattle starter Jamie Moyer had a 3-0 lead and was working on a shutout until running into trouble in the seventh, loading the bases with one out before Scott Sanders (2-6) relieved Moyer and got the second out.</p>
<p>Sanders walked home a run and Norm Charlton came in to face pinch-hitter Shawn Green. But the Blue Jays countered with Samuel, who blooped the first pitch down the right-field line and the ball bounced over Jay Buhner's head, clearing the bases for a 4-3 lead. Otis Nixon followed with an RBI double to cap the rally.</p>
<p>Samuel said he did not make good contact, "but it happened to land in the right place. Once the ball went over his head, the only thing on my mind was triple."</p>
<p>Hentgen (6-3) got the win despite surrendering solo homers to Buhner in the second, Joey Cora in the third and Ken Griffey, who smacked his 26th in the sixth.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays padded their lead with a three-run eighth, capped by Charlie O'Brien's two-run shot off Charlton.</p>
<p>In New York, Andy Pettitte notched his third complete game of the year and Luis Sojo and Bernie Williams homered in a six-run fifth inning as the Yankees bombed the Chicago White Sox 12-1 for their fourth straight win.</p>
<p>Pettitte (8-3) came within two outs of a shutout, allowing an RBI single to Albert Belle with one down in the ninth. He gave up seven hits, struck out five and didn't walk a batter.</p>
<p>Sojo hit a two-run shot off Chicago starter Jaime Navarro and Williams added a three-run shot off reliever Carlos Castillo to cap the outburst.</p>
<p>Derek Jeter and Wade Boggs combined to go 6-for-6 with seven runs scored for the Yankees, who banged out 15 hits.</p>
<p>Navarro (4-5) was torched for nine runs and eight hits with six walks in 4 1/3 innings.</p>
<p>In Boston, the Baltimore Orioles won both ends of a double header. Scott Erickson allowed a pair of runs over 7 2/3 innings and Rafael Palmeiro homered and drove in three runs as the Orioles took the opening game 7-2.</p>
<p>Erickson (9-2) allow seven hits and a pair of walks while striking out seven.</p>
<p>Palmeiro has a solo homer off Red Sox starter Vaughn Eshelman (0-1) in a two-run fourth and added an RBI single in a three-run eighth.</p>
<p>In the second game, B.J. Surhoff belted a two-run homer to cap a three-run second inning and three relievers combined to hold Boston scoreless over the final four frames as the Orioles topped the Red Sox 4-2.</p>
<p>Cal Ripken had four hits for the Orioles, who have won 11 of 13 games to take their record to a major league best 42-17.</p>
<p>Boston starter Tim Wakefield (2-5) took the loss. Arthur Rhodes (3-2) won with three scoreless relief innings.</p>
<p>In Cleveland, Charles Nagy survived seven rocky innings to beat the Brewers for the third time this season and Marquis Grissom added two hits and a pair of RBI to lead the Indians to a 5-4 win over Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Nagy (7-3) allowed four runs and 10 hits with one walk and five strikeouts. Cal Eldred (6-6) allowed five runs in 6 1/3 innings to lose to the Indians for the third time this year.</p>
<p>The Indians trailed 4-3 entering the bottom of seventh but scored twice to take the lead for good on a RBI single by Jim Thome and a sacrifice fly by David Justice.</p>
<p>In Detroit, Bobby Higginson and Damion Easley hit solo homers and Melvin Nieves had three hits to pace the Detroit Tigers to a 6-4 victory over the Oakland Athletics.</p>
<p>Higginson's homer off Ariel Prieto (4-4) in the first inning tied the game at 1-1 and Easley's leadoff shot to left field in the fifth gave the Tigers a 5-1 advantage.</p>
<p>Oakland narrowed the margin to a run when Geronimo Berroa and Canseco smacked solo homers in the eighth.</p>
<p>Willie Blair (4-2) posted the win for Detroit.</p>
<p>At Minnesota, Bob Tewksbury pitched an eight-hitter and Paul Molitor went 4-for-4 as the Twins crushed the Texas Rangers 10-1.</p>
<p>Tewksbury (3-6) allowed one run and walked none with four strikeouts to easily outpitch Bobby Witt (7-3), who was roughed up for six runs and seven hits over 2 2/3 innings.</p>
<p>Molitor, who scored three times, stroked a two-run triple in the first inning, singles in the third and fourth and a double in the sixth.</p>
<p>In Kansas City, Tim Salmon hit a two-run homer and drove in three runs and Jason Dickson pitched seven strong innings as the Anaheim Angels beat the Kansas City Royals 6-2, again denying Kevin Appier his 100th career win.</p>
<p>Salmon's homer in the eighth off Appier (4-5) gave the Angels a 5-2 lead. Chad Kreuter added a solo homer in the ninth for Anaheim.</p>
<p>Dickson (8-2) allowed two runs on six hits. Appier, who was denied the milestone victory for the seventh straight time, went eight innings and allowed five runs and nine hits.</p>
