<headline>French election sets Swedish crown on firmer track.</headline>

<p>The Swedish crown firmed on Monday as the left-wing French election win made investors fearing softer criteria for Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU) flee to currencies likely to stay out, analysts said.</p>
<p>"If the euro looks set to be strong, investors would turn away from the crown and embrace the Euro," Anders Olshov, currency analyst at Nordbanken told Reuters.</p>
<p>"Now when it looks as if the Euro will be soft investors see the possibility of doing the opposite and they are moving from the Euro to the crown." At 0830 GMT, the crown changed hands at 4.5155 against the mark, firming from 4.5355 late on Friday.  </p>
<p>Olshov expected the crown to remain fairly steady for the rest of the day and then strengthen to below 4.50 against the mark later this week.</p>
<p>Other analysts saw the crown moving further in this session.</p>
<p>"The crown could keep firming today," Bengt Hansson, senior economist at Handelsbanken, said. "It could reach 4.48 or 4.49 (to the mark)."  </p>
<p>The crown is also firming as uncertainty surrounding the French elections had disappeared, Olshov said, adding that the crown was hurt by political worries ahead of the elections.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, market players know fairly well what the Swedish government will say about EMU so that uncertainty has also decreased," Olshov said.</p>
<p>The Swedish government will announce its EMU view at 1430 GMT on Tuesday and economists are convinced it will choose to remain outside for a couple of years.</p>
<p>Some speculation that the EMU project will not be launched at all or be delayed might also be supporting the crown, Hansson said.</p>
<p>"Some belief that EMU won't happen could be affecting the crown -- even though this isn't the main scenario -- as we see Spain and Italy hurt but not Sweden," Hansson said, adding that movements were too small to draw conclusions.</p>
<p>Unlike Sweden, Spain and Italy are eager to join the union and their currencies softened early on Monday.</p>
<p>Swedish bond and currency trends have often trailed those of Italy and Spain as the three countries are so called high-yielders, but Hansson saw Sweden decoupling now.</p>
<p>"Today's strengthening indicates that the crown has decoupled from the so called garlic belt and instead has started tracking Denmark and Britain," Hansson said.</p>
<p>Favourable fundamentals, such as stronger state finances and a large current account surplus, and a more independent central bank have finally started to show in the crown rate, Hansson said.</p>
