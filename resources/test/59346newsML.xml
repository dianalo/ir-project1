<p>A Pentagon report said on Monday that commanders failed to provide adequate protection for a U.S. military post in Saudi Arabia hit by a truck bomb attack despite evidence it had become "a potential terrorist target."</p>
<p>"The chain of command of the 4404th Wing ... did not take all measures possible to protect the forces at Khobar Towers," the Pentagon investigators said in a report to President Bill Clinton on the bombing that killed 19 U.S. airmen at a housing housing complext near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on June 25.</p>
<p>"U.S. intelligence did not predict the precise attack on Khobar Towers," it said. "... (But) intelligence indicated that Khobar Towers was a potential terrorist target, and incidents from April through June 1996 reflected possible surveillance of the facility."</p>
<p>In forwarding the report to Clinton, Defence Secretary William Perry announced new military-wide steps to thwart terrorist attacks and called for heightened vigilance.</p>
<p>"We must expect that terrorists will attempt additional attacks," he said. "To face threats of this sophistication, all of our leaders -- civilian and military -- must adopt a radically new mind-set with regard to international terrorism."</p>
<p>Clinton, replying to reporters' questions, said his administration would "aggressively implement" recommendations of the report prepared by retired Army General Wayne Downing.</p>
<p>The survey, ordered by Perry after the June attack, mirrored findings of a much earlier report ordered by the Pentagon after the 1983 truck bombing that killed 241 U.S. servicemen on a peacekeeping mission in Beirut.</p>
<p>The new report said the United States still had great difficulty in gaining inside knowledge of the plans and activities of groups that might be targeting Americans, just as it did before the Beirut attack and a 1995 bombing that killed five Americans and two Indian nationals in Riyadh.</p>
<p>No one has claimed reponsibility for the Saudi attack.</p>
<p>The report said commanders of the 4404th Provisional Wing -- an Air Force unit policing a "no fly" zone in southern Iraq -- had not taken necessary precautions even though they did have some general advance intelligence warnings, however.</p>
<p>"The command relationships established in the region did not support unity of effort in force protection," it added.</p>
<p>It also said the 4404th wing commander, Air Force Brigadier General Terryl Schwalier, "never raised to his superiors force protection matters that were beyond his capability to correct."</p>
<p>Contrary to reports after the bombing, Downing also said Schwalier, now the Air Force's director of operations at the Pentagon, failed to raise the issue of expanding the perimeter or security of a fence outside the complex with his Saudi counterparts in the country's Eastern Province.</p>
<p>Since the attack, the U.S. military has moved most of the 5,000 military personnel in Saudi Arabia to a remote airbase at al-Kharj in the desert 60 miles (100 km) southeast of Riyadh. Many U.S. military dependents have been sent home.</p>
<p>In a key finding, Downing said Schwalier's bosses at the Air Force Central Command and at the U.S. Central Command based in Tampa, Florida, "did not provide sufficient guidance, assistance, and oversight to the 4404th Wing (Provisional) to avert or mitigate the attack on Khobar Towers."</p>
<p>"Their location 7,000 miles away contributed to this shortcoming," it said.</p>
<p>Downing, at a Pentagon news conference, said his commission believed it was very important to assign operational control of all U.S. forces operating in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf area to one forward-deployed headquarters.</p>
<p>After the October 23, 1983, truck bombing in Beirut, a Pentagon panel similarly faulted an unwieldy chain of command for failing to keep up with the potential terrorist threat.</p>
<p>Perry, in his letter to Clinton, said the terrorist threat would be "front and center" as a factor to be weighed by the Pentagon when it considers deploying troops abroad.</p>
<p>Downing's report did not recommend disciplinary action in connection with lax protective or intelligence efforts prior to the bomb blasts, but Perry ordered the Air Force to examine the need for any such punitive measures.</p>
