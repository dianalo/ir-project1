<p>Anglo-Australian mining giant RTZ-CRA said on Monday it has agreed to sell its Hidden Valley Gold Pty Ltd unit, which owns the Hidden Valley gold project in Papua New Guinea to Australian Gold Fields NL.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Australian Gold Fields would provide Hidden Valley Gold with A$20.28 million to pay back loans made by CRA to the company.</p>
<p>Hidden Valley also would pay RTZ-CRA a royalty on all gold it produces above 200,000 ounces from the tenement, RTZ-CRA said.  </p>
<p>The decision to sell Hidden Valley Gold was made public some months ago and resulted from RTZ-CRA's worldwide review of exploration announced in July 1996, the company said.</p>
<p>An RTZ-CRA spokesman said the company's other mine assets in Papua New Guinea were not currently up for sale.</p>
<p>These are its 100 percent-owned Wafi copper and gold prospect, a 53.6 percent stake in the Panguna copper and gold mine on Bougainville Island, which has not operated since 1989 due to rebel military actions, and its 17 percent owned Lihir gold mine.  </p>
<p>Hidden valey comprises two large gold deposits, Hidden Valley and Kaveroi Creek, and several gold prospects, located about 250 km north of the capital Port Moresby.</p>
<p>The most recent resource estimate for Hidden Valley shows an inferred resource of 33.9 million tonnes, grading 2.28 grams of gold a tonne and 40 grams per tonne of silver, containing about 2.5 million ounces of gold and 43.7 million ounces of silver, Hidden Valley said.</p>
<p>There was no current resource estimate for Kaveroi.  </p>
<p>A resource calculated in 1991 indicated an inferred resource of roughly 970,000 ounces of gold and 19.9 million ounces of silver.</p>
