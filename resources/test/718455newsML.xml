<p>Arsenal striker Ian Wright, who has been in trouble throughout his career for physical and verbal abuse of officials and opponents, was handed one of English soccer's largest fines for misconduct on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Football Association (F.A.) fined Wright 15,000 pounds ($25,200) for much-publicised incidents during two matches last April and warned him he would be thrown out of the game for a long time if he got in trouble again.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old England international, who is presently undergoing counselling to control his temper, was fined for remarks he made to the referee after a game against Blackburn and obscene gestures he made to the crowd at Coventry.</p>
<p>F.A. spokesman David Davies said an F.A. commission  had made it clear to Wright during a hearing on Thursday that he would face a very long ban if his poor behaviour continued.</p>
<p>The fact that he was having treatment for his problems helped the forward avoid a suspension this time.</p>
<p>"Ian Wright was told that the easy option for the commission was to suspend him for a long time," Davies said. "Many people would expect that to happen. It was given serious consideration."</p>
<p>"The commission gave him credit for facing up to those problems for the first time by seeking counselling."</p>
<p>Although he has a reputation for being an  accomplished forward, Wright's troubled career reads like a manual of what players should avoid doing on and around a football pitch.</p>
<p>In the past the striker has been fined for spitting and making obscene gestures at fans. He has also been in trouble for verbal attacks on officials several times as well as physical attacks on other players.</p>
<p>The commission effectively told Wright that this was his last chance.</p>
<p>"They have made it absolutely clear to Ian Wright that he could expect no sympathy whatsoever if he appeared before them again in similar and proven circumstances," Davies said.</p>
<p>"The severest of penalties that would remove him from the game for a very long time would be inevitable. The commission left him in no doubt that they believed he had reached a crossroads."</p>
<p>Arsenal did not want to comment on the ruling but it is clear that the club is relieved that Wright has avoided a ban this time. The forward will continue his "anger counselling" during the coming season.</p>
