<p>Baobab Solid Growth Ltd said on Friday it had exchanged its shareholdings in Brother Business Machines Ltd and Hi-Technology Supply Co Ltd for 110,000 shares in Mustek Electronics Ltd.</p>
<p>Baobab will also swap certain rights to prperty interests distributed by Mustek to its shareholders.</p>
<p>The exchange will raise Baobab's stake in Mustek to 39.93 percent from a current 26 percent. The transactions have effect from July 1, 1996.</p>
<p>Over the past twelve months, Baobab has injected 37.5 million rand into Mustek, which will be listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in March 1997.</p>
<p>Baobab said the swap transations would have no effect on its earnings as it does not equity account Mustek's earnings.</p>
<p>It said the transactions did not related to a cautionary announcement made on November 6. Shareholders were therefore advised to continue to exercise caution in their sharedealings. A detailed announcement was expected to be made early next year.</p>
