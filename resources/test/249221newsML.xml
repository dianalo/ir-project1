<p>Philippine President Fidel Ramos on Wednesday rejected opposition calls to put in writing a pledge to step down in 1998.</p>
<p>A top churchman had warned that allowing Ramos to run again could plunge the Philippines into "the darkness of the past".</p>
<p>"Why should I?" Ramos told his weekly news conference when asked about opposition demands that he submit a written pledge he will not seek re-election when his six-year term ends in June 1998. The constitution allows only a single term for president.</p>
<p>"I have said before that I will not run again, but for me to respond to the call to put it in writing is, I think, unbecoming of me to do so and unbecoming of them to ask me to do so," Ramos said.</p>
<p>Despite Ramos' frequent comments that he will step down in 1998, politicians belonging to his party have launched moves to amend the constitution so he could seek re-election.</p>
<p>The re-elect Ramos campaign grew last week when a previously unheard of citizens group announced it was gathering five million signatures to demand the lifting of the limits on the electoral terms of Ramos and other officials.</p>
<p>The group, calling itself the People's Initiative for Reform, Modernisation and Action (PIRMA), said the Philippines needed Ramos so he could continue his economic reform programme.</p>
<p>But the predominantly Roman Catholic country's most influential church leader, Cardinal Jaime Sin, slammed the move. Sin, apparently in a reference to the authoritarian rule of the late president Ferdinand Marcos, said unlimited terms for politicians resulted in the rise of dynasties and "effectively killed democracy".</p>
<p>"We must not forget the darkness of the past," Sin said. "We must not agree to plunge our nation back into the evils of the past." Leading human rights lawyer Rene Saguisag said: "If they (PIRMA) believe that only Ramos could lead this country, why don't we just pass a law which would make Mr Ramos immortal?"</p>
<p>Ramos also told the news conference that the government was holding talks with communist rebels to try to revive suspended peace talks aimed at ending the 27-year-old Marxist insurgency in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The guerrillas called off the talks last month after Manila refused to release a jailed rebel leader.</p>
<p>"We are are keeping the doors open," Ramos said.</p>
