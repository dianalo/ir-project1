<p>The Bundesbank on Tuesday declined to comment directly on a bout of renewed market speculation about imminent rate cuts in Germany, but pointed to earlier comments by its president Hans Tietmeyer that rates would remain steady in the short term.</p>
<p>In response to a Reuter query, chief Bundesbank spokesman Manfred Koerber said the central bank had no direct comment on market talk, but said "I would draw your attention to recent comments by Mr. Tietmeyer in the Spiegel magazine, when he observed - I see no short term reason for another interest rate change."</p>
