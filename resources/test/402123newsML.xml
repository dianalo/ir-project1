<p>The European Court of First Instance said on Tuesday the Euratom Supply Agency may bar imports of uranium into the European Union to ensure a future geographical diversity of supply.</p>
<p>The court dismissed claims against the European Commission for upholding the Agency's decision to reject a contract between German nuclear power plant operator Kernkraftwerke Lippe-Ems GmbH (KLE) and British Nuclear Fuels plc (BNFL) for uranium.</p>
<p>After the Agency learned the uranium was coming from a CIS state, probably Russia, they told KLE and BNFL the contract could only go forward if the uranium did not come from the CIS.</p>
<p>The Agency informed the parties its policy was to prevent an overdependence on single sources of supply of nuclear materials and placed a limit of 20 to 25 percent on supplies coming from CIS states into the Community.</p>
<p>According to the Agency's calculation, KLE had exceeded the level of reasonable dependency on CIS uranium.</p>
<p>The court noted one of the tasks of the Agency is to guarantee the reliability of supplies, and to that end it has the exclusive right to conclude supply contracts. The Commission, and the Agency, argued that too much reliance on a cheaper source of uranium would lead to overdependence, and a withering of Community and other third party sources.</p>
<p>"It should be noted that where decisions concerning economic and commercial policy and nuclear policy are involved, the Agency has a broad discretion when exercising its powers," the court said.</p>
<p>The court rejected all of KLE's arguments, including a claim for damages.</p>
