<p>The U.N. Human Rights Commission opened its annual meeting on Monday as some 1,000 supporters of Tibet protested outside against China's rule.</p>
<p>The demonstrators, brandishing signs reading "Freedom for Tibet", "China Tortures Tibet" and "Independence is a Birthright", were blocked from handing over a petition to China's diplomatic mission demanding fundamental rights.</p>
<p>"China's mission would not open its door to the Tibetans. The police accompanied the Tibetans to the door, but they were not allowed to deliver the petition," a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>"They left it in the mailbox."</p>
<p>Chinese troops occupied Tibet in 1951 and quickly suppressed a major rebellion in the mountainous region in 1959 which forced the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader, to seek exile in India.</p>
<p>The protesters may meet U.N. officials to seek release of the boy chosen as the 11th Panchen Lama, Tibet's second holiest monk, by the spiritual leader Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent campaign for Tibetan autonomy.</p>
<p>Western rights groups have accused China of detaining Gedhun Choekyi Nyima after choosing another boy in his place as the reincarnated "soul boy" of the late 10th Panchen Lama.</p>
<p>But Raidi, chairman of the Tibetan People's Congress, said last Friday that the seven year old was free and living with his parents. He said he was in China but declined to be specific.</p>
<p>China may be criticised -- but not formally censured -- during the six-week session, not only for Tibet and squashing dissent on the mainland, but in anticipation of its takeover of Hong Kong on July 1, according to diplomats.</p>
<p>Wu Jianmen, China's ambassador in Geneva, has called a press conference on Tuesday to defend his country's record on rights.</p>
<p>China was singled out in the U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights for having effectively silenced public dissent in 1996 through jailings, intimidation or exile.</p>
<p>But as for the last six consecutive years, Beijing is expected to emerge from the Commission largely unscathed, partly due to Asian regional solidarity on the 53-member body.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said in Beijing last Friday that any attempt to censure China was doomed to fail.</p>
<p>The United States has failed to lobby early enough to win passage of a resolution on China, according to activists. France has also slowed the European Union from taking a hard line.</p>
<p>The Commission is also due to examine alleged violations in Algeria, Burma, Colombia, Cuba, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Nigeria, Turkey and the states of ex-Yugoslavia. The occupied Arab territories including Palestine is on Tuesday's agenda.</p>
<p>U.N. chief Kofi Annan, in a message to the forum, vowed to be a "champion of human rights" and to ensure human rights are fully integrated in the organisation's work in all other areas.</p>
<p>"I call on all of you gathered here today, and for the next six weeks, to renew your own determination to take action to give concrete meaning to human rights..." Annan said.</p>
<p>Yet the global rights organisation Amnesty International has accused the Commission of losing credibility by allowing states of economic and strategic importance to the West off the hook -- despite alleged abuses. These include Saudi Arabia and Turkey.</p>
<p>Nearly 2,500 delegates from governments and rights groups including Amnesty and Asia Watch are attending the 53rd session.</p>
<p>They observed a minute of silence for five members of the U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda killed in February.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, the U.N. human rights programme has its first martyrs," Jose Ayala Lasso, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a speech in which he paid tribute to the slain Briton, Cambodian and three Rwandans.</p>
<p>Ayala Lasso, who leaves his post next week after three years to become Ecuador's foreign minister, has been criticised by some activists for failing to speak out publicly about abuses. "I regret not having been able to do more," said Ayala Lasso, who had been preparing a high-profile trip to China.</p>
