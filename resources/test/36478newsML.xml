<p>Norwegian police took the unusual step on Thursday of appealing to foreign tourists for help in solving the brutal murder of a 20-year-old Norwegian woman.</p>
<p>Trude Espaas was raped and killed by an unknown assailant in her home town of Geiranger, south of Aalesund on the Norwegian coast, on August 8.</p>
<p>Since her body was found hidden under a pile of stones near a forest path, police have searched in vain for suspects.</p>
<p>"The murder started an intensive hunt in Norway, but the Norwegian investigators believe the answer could be found abroad," police spokeswoman Lisbeth Sveum said, explaining the unorthodox step of appealing to tourists for help.</p>
<p>Geiranger, a town of just 270 people on a scenic fjord, is one of Norway's most popular tourist resorts visited by about 8,000 tourists a day in the summer.</p>
<p>Sveum said tourists there at the time of the murder came from Germany, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, the Czech Republic, Japan and the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>"Norwegian police want to hear from foreigners who were in Geiranger at the time and who made observations, took pictures or shot video films," a police statement said. "Without knowing it, the tourists may have pictures of the victim and key witnesses."</p>
