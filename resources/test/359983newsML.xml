<p>Ukraine plans to launch government bonds aimed mainly at individual savers in early April, the deputy Minister of Finance said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"In keeping with the government order which was signed on February 5, the volume of the first six-month issue of government bonds will be 50 million hrvynia and sales will begin at certain banks on April 2," Andriy Lytvyn said.</p>
<p>Volumes will grow if demand is high, he added.</p>
<p>"The nominal price of one bond will be 50 hryvnias and is aimed at citizens of Ukraine, but there is nothing stopping businesses or non-residents from buying the paper," he said.</p>
<p>Returns will equal the rate of inflation plus one percent.</p>
<p>The ministry's long-term plans foresee one- and two-year bonds being issued eventually, he added.</p>
