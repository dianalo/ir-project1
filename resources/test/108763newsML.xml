<p>Influential U.S. rating agency Standard and Poor's gave South Africa a cautious bill of economic health on Thursday, but investors remained edgy as the rand took a fresh dive.</p>
<p>S&amp;P affirmed the country's long-term foreign currency credit rating at BB plus -- one notch below investment grade -- an outcome analysts said was the best that could be expected.</p>
<p>"Given the recent turmoil in our financial markets it's good that they are not considering a downgrade," said Dennis Dykes, chief economist at Nedcor bank in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters last month had predicted that the rating would be unchanged.</p>
<p>S&amp;P, which also held its rating for South Africa's domestic debt at BBB plus, said the outlook for both ratings was positive, supported by the government's commitment to fiscal and monetary discipline set out in its macro-economic strategy.</p>
<p>The country also had a manageable level of debt, low inflation and strengthening political stability, 2-1/2 years on from the first all-race elections, it said.</p>
<p>But any improvement in credit ratings would hinge on implementation of market-friendly policies laid out in the medium-term economic plan -- notably on the budget, exchange control liberalisation and privatisation.</p>
<p>On the foreign exchange market the rand fell to a seven-week low of 4.5640 bid against a strong dollar on Thursday and technical analysts said the charts pointed to further weakness.</p>
