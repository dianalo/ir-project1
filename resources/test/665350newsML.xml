<p>European Union leaders attending this week's Amsterdam summit might be wondering if their Dutch hosts have discovered a magic formula for creating jobs.</p>
<p>While countries such as Germany and France struggle to contain rising unemployment, the Netherlands is enjoying strong growth in employment and a steady fall in the jobless total.</p>
<p>The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has singled out the Netherlands as one of a handful of member countries which have succeeded in reducing structural unemployment over the last decade.</p>
<p>An extra 100,000 jobs are expected to be created both this year and next and the OECD sees Dutch unemployment falling for a fourth straight year in 1998 to 5.6 percent of the labour force.</p>
<p>Economists trace the jobs recovery back to the early 1980s, when the country faced a soaring budget deficit, rapid wage growth, excessive dependence on welfare and rising unemployment.</p>
<p>The government, unions and employers reached a consensus under which unions agreed to moderate their wage demands to help restore company profits and boost demand for labour.</p>
<p>That consensus -- complemented by tax cuts and labour market and social security reform -- is still largely intact.</p>
<p>Lans Bovenberg, deputy director of the government's bureau for economic analysis, said that while unit labour costs in the Netherlands had been more or less steady over the last 15 years, they had risen by about 2.5 percent a year in Germany.</p>
<p>Wage restraint, Bovenberg said, had set in motion a virtuous circle of improved competitiveness, higher exports and more labour-intensive growth.</p>
<p>"Twenty years ago, economists were discussing the Dutch disease. Now they talk about the Dutch miracle," he said.</p>
<p>Rick van der Ploeg, a professor of economics and member of parliament for the Dutch Labour party, said the Netherlands' "capitalism with a friendly face" had much in common with the economic policies of Britain's new Labour government.</p>
<p>Van der Ploeg said he could imagine Germany adopting a similar policy mix because it also had a tradition of building consensus and long-term investment but he did not think it likely that France would follow the same route for the time being.</p>
<p>"I think France still has to learn more to make proper use of the market... There's still too much state intervention," he said.</p>
<p>Despite its recent achievements, economists say the Netherlands must keep up its efforts to put more people to work.</p>
<p>Statistics -- even those published by the OECD and the EU -- tend to understate the true level of unemployment because hundreds of thousands of unproductive workers have been shunted out of the labour force and into social security schemes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a growing tendency for workers to take early retirement is narrowing the tax base and placing increasing pressure on the social security and state pension systems.</p>
<p>Only 42 percent of Dutch people aged 50 to 64 are still working, compared with equivalent figures of 57 percent for Britain and 50 percent for Germany.</p>
<p>Bovenberg and Van der Ploeg said the "greying" of the population made it imperative to bring more people into the workforce through further reform of taxes and pensions.</p>
<p>"We could have shortages in the labour market soon, so we're going to have to think how we can draw on these reservoirs of labour," Van der Ploeg said.</p>
