<p>The New Orleans Saints on Wednesday named linebackers coach Rick Venturi as interim head coach to replace Jim Mora, who resigned on Monday after guiding the NFL club for 10 1/2 years.</p>
<p>Venturi was appointed after Tuesday's confusion in which Director of Pro Personnel Chet Franklin turned down the job, forcing the team to postpone a news conference in which he was to be named to succeed Mora.</p>
<p>Venturi is in his 15th season in the NFL. He spent 12 years with the Indianapolis Colts organisation, first as a linebackers coach and defensive coordinator.</p>
<p>The Colts promoted Venturi to interim head coach during the the 1991 season, but the team posted a dismal 1-10 record over the final 11 games under Venturi.</p>
<p>Mora, who had the longest continuous term of service with the same team of any current coach, resigned one day after berated his club following a 19-7 loss at Carolina.</p>
<p>During a furious tirade, Mora said he "was embarrassed and ashamed of our team."</p>
<p>The 61-year-old Mora compiled a 93-78 record, guiding the team to its first winning season and playoff berth. But the Saints have not had a winning record since 1992.</p>
<p>Venturi takes over a club with a 2-6 record, but he tried to put on optimistic spin on the Saints' future.</p>
<p>"This team has won two of the last three football games," Venturi said. "It approaches the last eight weeks with optimism, with committment. I feel this is a good opportunity. I feel this football team can be successful."</p>
