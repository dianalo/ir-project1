<headline>NZ seeks more detail on butter arrests in London.</headline>

<p>New Zealand's International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said on Monday he was concerned about the arrest of six butter company officials in London last week but did not intend to become directly involved.</p>
<p>Smith said in a statement he believed the fraud charges related directly to a dispute between New Zealand's privately-owned Dairy Board and the British authorities.</p>
<p>"It would be highly inappropriate for the government to interfere in the actual case before the UK courts," he said.</p>
<p>British Customs and Excise arrested six officials from Dairy Board-owned Milk Products Holdings (UK) Ltd and its retail arm Anchor Foods on Friday and they were charged in the City of London Magistrates Court with fraud of 5.4 million pounds (US$8.8 million).</p>
<p>At the weekend the head of the farmer cooperative Dairy Board claimed the customs' action may be linked to European Union (EU) attempts to curb New Zealand's butter exports.</p>
<p>The trade minister said officials were currently seeking more detail and information and Wellington may need to respond "if the case raises any broad trade policy issues".</p>
<p>"I want to determine whether there are any matters where it would be appropriate for the government to be involved in sorting out our trading relationship with Britain and the EU.</p>
<p>"We are of course concerned about the arrests and we will be monitoring developments closely," Smith added.</p>
<p>The six men pleaded not guilty to a series of charges relating to imports of butter in 1995 and 1996, and were bailed to reappear on May 8.</p>
<p>If convicted, they could face up to seven years' imprisonment and unlimited fines.</p>
<p>Customs and Excise claim that the two firms imported butter under a so-called preferential tariff scheme when the quota for preferential product had been exhausted.</p>
<p>Under EU rules a certain amount of butter, categorised as preferential, can be brought into the community at a rate of about one third of the full tariff usually due on imports.</p>
<p>Other charges relate to product which Customs and Excise said did not meet the criteria for the preferential quota.</p>
<p>The six men include the managing director of Anchor in the UK, Fernando Guerra, 43, and Edmond (Monnie) Verscheuren, 57, the Dairy Board's highest-ranking official in Europe.</p>
<p>New Zealand is currently in dispute with the EU over spreadable butter, with the spat due to go before the disputes committee of the World Trade Organisation in Geneva.</p>
<p>The government is supporting the Dairy Board in this case.</p>
