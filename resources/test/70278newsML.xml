<p>Moves by President Alvaro Arzu to fight military corruption, slash the size of the army and end a decades-long civil war have raised fears of retaliation by the Guatemalan armed forces.</p>
<p>"You can't underestimate the possibility of reprisals. There will be reactions," said Carlos Aldana, spokesman for the Guatemalan archbishopric, which has called on Guatemalans to support Arzu's efforts to limit the army's power.</p>
<p>Arzu and Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein told reporters corrupt elements could start threatening government officials. When Guatemala has tried to move against corrupt military officers in the past, Stein said bluntly, "they started killing judges."</p>
<p>Unlike his three civilian predecessors from 1986 to 1995, who could not shake the army's influence on every sector of Guatemalan life, Arzu has moved decisively since January.</p>
<p>He ordered the army to halt 36 years of counterinsurgency actions against guerrilla fighters and last week, in the most sweeping action yet, the government fired a score of allegedly corrupt officials including two generals, one of them the deputy defence minister.</p>
<p>The top-ranking army officers, police chiefs and customs administrators who were fired are all suspected of involvement with a huge, long-established smuggling ring that officials say cheated the government out of millions of dollars a month.</p>
<p>The anti-corruption operation last Tuesday struck at the heart of the military intelligence community, which is deeply involved with organised crime as well as with assassinations, disappearances and torture during Guatemala's dirty war.</p>
<p>Two days later, government and guerrilla peace negotiators signed a landmark agreement to reduce the army by a third, limit the military's role to defending Guatemala from external threats and give Congress control over military intelligence.</p>
<p>Arzu did not begin the peace process but he gave it impetus. Guerrillas and government negotiators say they will sign a definitive agreement to end the civil war by December.</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced everything will run smoothly.</p>
<p>"Anything is possible. There could be a backlash. ... There's still fear of (a coup) because of the history of the country," said a foreign observer in Guatemala, who did not want to be identified.</p>
<p>On the record, most government officials and international supporters express enthusiastic support for Arzu's commitment to the peace process, which they hope will energise Guatemala's economy and stimulate foreign investment.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Julio Balconi told Reuters the army was willing to make sacrifices for peace.</p>
<p>Cesar Gaviria, secretary-general of the Organisation of American States, in Guatemala this week, pledged support for the fight against corruption and for implementation of the peace accords.</p>
<p>A government-sponsored jingle on the radio chirps, "let's make a change, let's go, Guatemala," cajoling citizens to get on board the peace train. But Guatemala has yet to shake off years of terror. A one-hour blackout in almost the entire country on Thursday had Guatemalans fearing that a coup was under way. Power outages traditionally accompany coups here.</p>
<p>Human rights leader Helen Mack, who has fought to put military officers accused of killing her anthropologist sister in 1990 on trial, fears army intimidation will keep the corruption scandal out of the courts. "The judges will obstruct the entire process in the struggle against impunity," Mack predicted.</p>
<p>Aldana of the archbishop's office said if corrupt military officers actually go on trial, the risks the government has taken would all be worthwhile. "It is riskier to Guatemalan society as a whole not to take these measures," he said.</p>
