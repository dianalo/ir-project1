<p>Mentmore Abbey Plc said it has made an agreed offer for British Data Management Plc, valuing BDM's share capital at around 42.55 million stg.  </p>
<p>Mentmore said it is offering 104 new Mentmore shares for every 50 BDM shares, which the company said valued BDM at 170.56p per share.</p>
<p>There is also a full cash alternative at 156p per share, which compares with BDM's closing price on Tuesday of 174-1/2p.</p>
<p>BDM directors and their family trusts have undertaken to accept the offer in respect of shares which amount to a total stake of some 32.88 percent.</p>
<p>The company has also agreed, subject to the offer going through, to dispose of BDM's Eurocrate unit to BDM chairman Stephen Crown and other BDM directors.  </p>
<p>The statement said the enlarged group would be a leader in both self-storage and data management, with benefits from better space utilisation and more effective use of management systems.</p>
<p>BDM separately released results for the year ended June 30 showing pre-tax profit of 2.6 million pounds on sales of 19.8 million, and declared a second interim dividend of 3.75p. Net assets at the year end were 15.5 million stg.</p>
<p>BDM said the results were lower than expected because the company had decided to take what it said was "a more prudent approach to customer recoveries", the elimination of intercompany profit and the adoption of a more conservative approach to costs in connection with new government data contracts.</p>
<p>Mentmore chairman Nicholas Smith said buying BDM would enable it to accelerate the growth of Abbey's storage business and extend BDM's activities to more parts of the country.</p>
<p>"I warmly welcome the offer from Mentmore Abbey, which I believe will create a business with a strong presence in the market for the storage of goods and data," said BDM's Stephen Crown.</p>
