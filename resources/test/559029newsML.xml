<p>One of the main aims of Botswana's exchange rate policy is to prevent the pula from becoming too strong, Bank of Botswana deputy governor Linah Mohohlo told businessmen at a conference.</p>
<p>Attending the First Southern Africa Internatioal Dialogue on Smart Partnership for the Generation of Wealth, she also defended Botswana's interest rate policy.</p>
<p>Rates had risen but were lower than those in Botswana's major trading partner country, neigbouring South Africa. Botswana's Bank rate stands at 12.50 percent against 17 percent in South Africa.</p>
<p>She said interest rates in Botswana were aimed at encouraging private savings. Whilst Botswana saved between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), most of this came from the government.</p>
<p>"This is fine whilst the government is running large bugdte surpluses, but in the longer term, this will probably not be the case," she said.</p>
<p>"It will be necessary to boost private household savings. Monetary policy is therefore taking a long term outlook."</p>
<p>Botswana is forecasting a 14th successive budget surplus for 1997/1998.</p>
<p>The Bank of Botswana has been repeatedly criticised for indirectly linking the pula to the South African rand, which depreciated 22 percent on a trade-weighted basis in 1996.</p>
<p>Critics have said this might protect a fledgling non-mineral export industry, but deters investors, who are wary of falling currencies.</p>
<p>Botswana earns 80 percent of its export revenues and 55 percent of its gross domestic product from diamond exports, traded in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>More than 80 per cent of its non-traditional exports are destined for South Africa and traded in rands. The same percentage of its imports also come from South Africa.</p>
<p>Over the last 21 years, since the pula was introduced, its real exchange rate against the rand has never fluctuated by more than 10 per cent from its nominal value.</p>
<p>Critics say the effective shadowing of the rand has pressured the pula unnecessarily, given Botswana's reserves which currently equate to 30 months of import cover.</p>
