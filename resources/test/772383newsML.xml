<headline>Qantas hit by new domestic airline rumour.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-08-01</dateline>

<p>Shares in Qantas Airways Ltd suffered some  jet-lag on Friday on rumours that Brian Grey, founder of the failed  Compass Airlines, has the backing of some overseas airlines to start  up a Australian airline.</p>
<p>At 10.50 a.m. (0050 GMT), Qantas shares were 11 cents or 3.61 percent  lower at A$2.94 with about 800,000 shares traded. Qantas shares have  fallen almost eight percent since Wednesday.  </p>
<p>"There are rumours that Brian Grey has got the backing of a foreign  airline. That seems to be behind the strong selling today," one Sydney-based  broker said.</p>
<p>A Melbourne-based broker said: "We have heard that he (Grey) is making  presentations to institutions and is trying to raise A$100 million  -- A$50 million for working capital and A$50 million for security  deposit on aircraft."</p>
<p>"There is also talk that he has the backing of a couple of Asian airlines,"  the Melbourne broker said. Grey has been in talks with Qantas about  sub-leasing facilities at five airports around the country.  </p>
<p>Grey started the original Compass Airlines, which was placed in liquidation  in December 1991. Southern Cross Holdings Ltd carried on its airline  business under the Compass banner until March 1993, but it was not  associated with Grey.</p>
<p>Grey's new airline hopeful is called Aussie Airlines.</p>
<p>Qantas and rival Ansett Airlines, which is owned by News Corp Ltd  and Air New Zealand Ltd, are the only airlines operating Australia-wide  services.</p>
