<title>ITALY: UPS workers in Milan strike over layoffs.</title>
<headline>UPS workers in Milan strike over layoffs.</headline>
<dateline>MILAN 1997-03-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>Workers at the Milan branch of United Parcel Services of America Inc (UPS) went on strike on Wednesday in protest at UPS plans to cut 150 jobs in Italy.</p>
<p>Union sources said 115 workers out of 130 on the morning shift stopped work while total adherence to the stoppage, including the evening shifts, was not yet known.</p>
<p>Union representatives from UPS Barcelona also joined the industrial action, the sources said.</p>
<p>Workers also demonstrated outside the Milan prefecture and offices of the Milan provincial government offices where union members presented officials with demands for intervention by the authorities to redefine the role of the multinational in Italy.</p>
<p>Union sources said that while UPS was in good health financially it seemed to be in the interests of the group to register balance sheet losses in Italy on the company books in the U.S., and so take advantage of tax breaks.</p>
<p>The sources said Italian staff were due to hold a national eight hour strike on Friday, with some 85 percent of the 900 UPS staff in Italy expected to be involved in the stoppage.</p>
<p>Union members of UPS in Spain have said they also plan strike action.</p>
<p>The U.S. Teamsters union, which said it represents nearly 200,000 UPS workers in the U.S., has written to UPS Italy protesting against job cut plans.</p>
