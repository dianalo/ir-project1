<p>The Croatian parliament on Wednesday enacted a new media law to strengthen the country's renewed bid for links to the European Union.</p>
<p>Last spring, a campaign by President Franjo Tudjman's nationalist HDZ party to muzzle independent media by legal ploys contributed to a Council of Europe decision to suspend Croatia's bid for membership, the first stage towards EU links.</p>
<p>But Croatia appears to have rehabilitated its application by forging diplomatic relations with Serbia and helping international peace coordinators conduct orderly postwar elections in neighbouring Bosnia last month.</p>
<p>HINA, the state news agency, said the new measure guaranteed press freedoms according to standards set by the Council of Europe but also required the media to distribute "truthful and correct" information to the best of its ability.</p>
<p>It defined cases where the publisher was freed of financial liability for information causing offence if it was judged to be in the public interest and had been given in good faith.</p>
<p>The law passed by a 100-4 vote with seven abstentions. The only opponent was an extreme right-wing faction.</p>
<p>The HDZ sought to have the new law require media organisations to take out hefty insurance for possible damage to third persons as a condition for publishing anything.</p>
<p>But the clause was scuttled by protests from opposition parties and the national journalists' union.</p>
<p>They said such a rule could have bankrupted small independent media who have been critical of the government and thwart the growth of free press in general.</p>
<p>The main national newspapers as well as Croatian radio and television are controlled by the governing HDZ.</p>
<p>Last week, a Croatian state court acquitted two prominent independent journalists of libelling Tudjman in a boost for freedom of the press in Croatia.</p>
<p>European diplomats in Zagreb said the Council of Europe would probably decide to admit Croatia when its application came up for reconsideration in mid-October.</p>
<p>A new media law with stronger provisions for press freedom was one of the membership conditions set by the Council.</p>
<p>Diplomats say Tudjman, a former communist general, and the predominant rightist faction in the HDZ grouped around him dislike independent media and have sought to curb it since Croatia won independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.</p>
<p>Several critical newspapers were silenced by HDZ legal manoeuvres in which party loyalists took over their management.</p>
