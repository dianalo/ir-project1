<p>The Chinese yuan closed at a new 20-month high of 8.2935 against the U.S. dollar in Shanghai on Wednesday, up from Tuesday's 8.2940 due to buying from Chinese banks to meet strong holiday demand, traders said.</p>
<p>The yuan opened down at 8.2950 and hit an intraday low of 8.2951 early in trading. It consolidated upward to move around 8.2940 before hitting an intraday high of 8.2933 late in the session.</p>
<p>Trading was active with most done at about 8.2940, traders said.  </p>
<p>Dealers said strong demand for the yuan pushed the price to a new high in the absense of any clear resistance.</p>
<p>Although selling slowed the yuan's rise at the opening, its uptrend was strongly supported by active bids at about 8.2950.</p>
<p>"Several major banks were seen buying the yuan at lower levels and kept its bottom solid," he added.</p>
<p>A second dealer said the yuan was expected to breach the closing high of 8.2928, reached on May 19,1995, if the central bank does not cap its rise.</p>
<p>"There is no clear technical resistance to the yuan climbing to 8.2900," he said.  </p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the yuan to move up slowly tomorrow.</p>
<p>The yuan closed up at an intraday high of 6.8001 from 6.9160 against 100 Japanese yen and up slightly at 1.0710 from 1.0713 against the Hong Kong dollar.</p>
