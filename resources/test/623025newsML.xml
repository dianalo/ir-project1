<p>Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA's presentation to analysts on its debt restructuring programme on Thursday was well received, an analyst who attended the meeting said.</p>
<p>However, he said he did not expect the briefing to spark a big move in the share price, which closed in London at 69-1/2p, unchanged from Wednesday.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel launched a prospectus for its financial restructuring earlier in the day and briefed analysts during the afternoon.</p>
<p>"It was well received," the analyst said of the meeting.</p>
<p>"They provided a lot of information and details. The important thing is that the restructuring will provide the company with a lower cost of debt and longer maturities," he added.</p>
<p>"These are steps to restore the financial health of the operation."</p>
<p>The company is seeking to restructure almost nine billion pounds ($14.7 billion) of debt owed to a 225-bank syndicate.</p>
<p>The debt restructuring must be approved by shareholders. --Debra Sherman, London Newsroom +44 171 542 5106 ($ = 0.611 British Pounds)</p>
