<p>Daimler-Benz AG said Wednesday its U.S. truck subsidiary Freightliner has agreed to buy the heavy truck business of Ford Motor Co.</p>
<p>Financial details were not immediately available.</p>
<p>Daimler said that under the deal, Ford will turn over production, research and development of its "HN80" truck to Freightliner.</p>
<p>The deal also calls for Freightliner to take over production of Ford's L-Series trucks and Ford cargo trucks.</p>
<p>The Ford vehicles are sold in the United States, Canada and Australia, Daimler said in a statement.</p>
<p>Freightliner, based in Portland, Ore., and acquired in 1981 by Daimler, said the Ford deal would push its annual revenues to more than 1 billion marks ($595 million).</p>
<p>Daimler also said Ford would remain in the light and mid-sized truck business while Freightliner would add important products in the market for construction and other trucks that weigh eight to 15 metric tons.</p>
<p>Ford's stock slipped 12.5 cents to $33.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. Daimler's U.S. shares lost 62.5 cents to $72.625, also on the NYSE.</p>
