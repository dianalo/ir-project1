<p>The World Freight Group (WFG) is aiming to recruit more members in Latin America and Africa, said WFG general secretary Bert van der Velde.</p>
<p>The world network of forwarders, established in 1992 in Singapore, wants to focus its recruitment drive on Latin America. This year the group's annual conference will be held in Florida and it hopes this will attract potential recruits, he said.</p>
<p>WFG already has member companies in Mexico, Brazil and Chile, Colombia and Argentina but is keen to find potential members in the other countries in the region.</p>
<p>WFG was originally set up in a bid to give the forwarders a chance to compete against the integrators, said Van der Velde. Ten companies linked together originally but this has now increased to more than 40 forwarders worldwide.</p>
<p>Membership is by invitation only and companies have to have been in business for more than two years and be multimodal, he added.</p>
<p>"The companies work together on almost an exclusive basis and this has enabled them to grow into a very powerful tool in the freight forwarding business. We are now represented at just over 100 airports in the world," said Van der Velde.</p>
<p>Currently, WFG is working on its Internet project and aims to have 50 pages on the Internet by the end of February. The forwarding network then aims to develop an Intra-net project.</p>
