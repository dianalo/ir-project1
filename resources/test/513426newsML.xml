<p>A Mexican immigrant jailed for almost 14 years on death row in a Texas prison for allegedly killing a policeman began on Wednesday his return trip to Mexico and freedom.</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Naturalisation Service (INS) agents accompanied Ricardo Aldape Guerra in a blue sedan as they took off from Houston to Brownsville, Texas, on the U.S.-Mexico border 300 miles (480 km) to the southwest.</p>
<p>Aldape Guerra, who came to the United States illegally in 1982, was whisked away by the INS as soon as he was released from Harris County Jail on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>"I never committed any crime," he told Mexico's Televisa news network on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Mexican government had a plane waiting to fly him home to Monterrey, Mexico, but an INS spokeswoman said Aldape Guerra would be treated like any other illegal immigrant and driven to the border.</p>
<p>His family and Mexican officials followed the INS vehicle in a van. At Brownsville, Aldape Guerra was to cross a bridge on the Rio Grande into Matamoros, Mexico, where he was to finally board a plane for his home city of Monterrey, officials said.</p>
<p>Mexican authorities were not sure where Aldape Guerra would cross the border but promised to have a plane ready to fly him to Monterrey in Nuevo Leon state, just two hours' drive from the border.</p>
<p>Mexican radio and television stations, always eager for stories about Mexicans suffering at the hands of their northern neighbour, made his impending return their top story.</p>
<p>Aldape Guerra's legal nightmare ended after Harris County District Attorney Johnny Holmes said on Tuesday he would drop the murder charge against him and not seek a new trial.</p>
<p>Holmes told reporters that a judge's decision earlier this week to throw out six key prosecution witnesses for lack of credibility had made it impossible to retry the case.</p>
<p>Aldape Guerra, now 35, was convicted in October 1982 and sentenced to death for the killing of Houston police officer James Harris during a routine traffic stop.</p>
<p>Aldape Guerra contended from the beginning that an acquaintance, Roberto Carrasco Flores, shot Harris. In 1994, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt ordered a new trial because he said police had intimidated witnesses into identifying Aldape Guerra as the shooter and prosecutors, in their zeal to avenge a cop's death, had manipulated evidence to get a conviction.</p>
<p>But Aldape Guerra, who had been within hours of execution on several occasions, remained on death row until last August when a federal appellate court upheld Hoyt's decision. He was moved to Harris County jail to await a new trial.</p>
<p>Defence attorney Scott Atlas told reporters before Aldape Guerra left jail that his client was "too emotional" to speak to the press.</p>
<p>"He said 'This is like starting my life all over again. I want to be with my loved ones. I'm just not ready to talk to the press yet,'" Atlas said.</p>
<p>Aldape Guerra left the jail in a vehicle with tinted windows that made him barely visible to a media horde waiting outside. But earlier he had smiled and waved from a second-floor window as he drank coffee with his lawyers.</p>
<p>Mexican consulate spokesman Mauricio Garcia said Aldape Guerra had expressed one wish as he awaited his release. "He's very anxious to eat some Mexican food," Garcia said.</p>
