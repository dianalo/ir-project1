<p>Electronic money has the potential to slash profits of central banks and distort monetary aggregates, but its future is still so uncertain that central bankers will not immediately impose regulations, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said Sunday.</p>
<p>Electronic payment systems (e-money), which are still in their infancy, could challenge the dominance of cash in small-value payments by making retail transactions cheaper for consumers and merchants, BIS said in a report, "Implications for Central Banks of the Development of Electronic Money."</p>
<p>But a diminished role for cash goes straight to the heart of the business of central banking by affecting the behaviour of monetary aggregates, which are used as policy targets in some countries, and the implementation of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Cash makes up a signficant part of the liabilities of central banks so an extensive spread of e-money would shrink their balance sheets. In the United States, for example, cash makes up 84 percent of the liabilities of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Circumstances could arise in which a central bank could not conduct large enough reserve-absorbing operations to sterilise foreign exchange intervention, the report warned.</p>
<p>E-money will also affect central bank's seignorage revenue, a term that describes the money central banks make from printing notes, a monopoly central banks hold. Seignorage is a major component of the profits central banks pass on to governments.</p>
<p>In 1994, for example, the Fed handed over some $20 billion to the U.S. Treasury, most from seignorage.</p>
<p>Despite such serious implications, central banks prefer to perform a balancing act regarding the timing of any possible regulation. Meanwhile they will watch the evolution of e-money.</p>
<p>Comprehensive regulation at an early stage could stifle innovation, but there is also a risk that the cost of regulation would be significantly higher if it were introduced too late.</p>
<p>"G10 governors have indicated that they intend to stay vigilant, to monitor closely the evolution of electronic money schemes and, while respecting competition and innovation, to take any appropriate action if necessary," the report said.</p>
<p>This approach to e-money illustrates how central banks' are learning to steer and nudge financial markets along a desired path without strangling the free market.</p>
<p>The report gives an overview of the issues raised by e-money and is part of efforts by the Group of 10 leading industrial nations to track electronic money since end-1995.</p>
<p>A wide range of issues raised by e-money has already been studied -- monetary policy, legal issues, law enforcement, security, regulatory policy -- but so far central bankers have discovered no significant problems.</p>
<p>As William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve said at a recent payments conference in New York: "We're not quite sure when it (e-money) might become a problem. It might, and that's one of the reasons we have to keep watching."</p>
<p>The need for a response by central banks will largely depend on the extent to which e-money replaces cash.</p>
<p>If the spread of e-money is moderate, the only measures central banks are likely to take is to adapt monetary aggregates to include e-money and allow for a shift in velocities.</p>
<p>However, if e-money becomes very popular, central banks will be faced with several options, including issuing e-money, expanding the coverage of reserve requirements to include e-money, issue new central bank bills or pay interest on reserve balances to encourage private banks to hold larger deposits.</p>
<p>The advantages of central banks issuing e-money themselves and expanding reserve requirements would be to boost the size of central bank balance sheets and offset the loss of seignorage.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of central banks issuing e-money is that it limits competition and reduces incentives to innovate. The disadvantage of reserve requirements, which are normally non-interest bearing, is that they are seen as a tax that distorts competition and is therefore being reduced or phased out in many countries.</p>
<p>The main difference so far between countries' treatment of e-money concerns which firms will be allowed to issue e-money.</p>
<p>Banks or other credit institutions are already regulated while non-bank institutions are subject to less oversight.</p>
<p>In some countries only credit institutions will be allowed to issue multi-purpose prepaid cards -- such as the European Monetary Institute (EMI) has recommended -- while in other countries, such as the United States, non-depository institutions may be allowed to issue e-money.</p>
