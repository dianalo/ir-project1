<p>The Bank of Spain cut its official money market rate to 6.75 percent from 7.25 percent on Thursday, the sixth reduction in its key rate this year.</p>
<p>All 10 analysts polled by Reuters on Wednesday had expected the central bank to cut today, but they were divided on whether the cut would be 25 or 50 basis points.</p>
<p>Following are analysts views on the cut:</p>
<p>CARMEN HERNANSANZ, ECONOMIST AT MERRILL LYNCH</p>
<p>"As expected, the Bank of Spain cut rates. We had expected a smaller reduction but it's not that surprising. The move's been taken well."</p>
<p>BENJAMIN SERRANO, ECONOMIST AT ANALISTAS FINANCIEROS</p>
<p>"They had scope to cut one-half point and they took advantage of it. The Bundesbank's cut in August gave the Bank of Spain room."</p>
<p>"My impression is that there is more scope (some 25 basis points) left this year. The presentation of the budget must have satisfied the Bank of Spain."</p>
<p>JUAN ANTONIO MIELGO, ECONOMIST BANK OF AMERICA</p>
<p>"This means that once the Bank of Spain analised the budget they saw it optimistically. This supports the budget. I would take it as a sign that with the small amount of time (the government) has had they've done well.</p>
<p>"I would expect that at about the time of the next inflation data they may give us another 25 basis points in cuts. There continue to be expectations of a cut but we will have to wait for inflation and growth data."</p>
