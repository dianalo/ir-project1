<headline>German debt, futures firmer in yield-curve plays.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-09-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>German Bunds and futures ended dealings on Monday slightly firmer due to a firmer U.S. market and buying interest in the four- to seven-year area of the German yield curve, traders said.</p>
<p>DTB December Bund futures ended up seven basis points at 96.81 and traded within a range from 96.69 to 96.86 during a session with volume in Frankfurt under 40,000 contracts.</p>
<p>"The German market right now has a rather good orientation," said one Frankfurt trader. "It looks like we are heading toward 97.00 in December futures."</p>
<p>Dealers said the gains were more than just in futures.</p>
