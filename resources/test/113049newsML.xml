<p>Four Brierley Investments executives' were paid more than NZ$1 million each, the company disclosed in its 1996 Annual Report published on Monday.</p>
<p>BIL chief executive Paul Collins received a salary package of $1.437 million, making him the highest-paid businessman in New Zealand identified so far.</p>
<p>Hong-Kong based BIL executive Andrew Meehan was second, receiving $1.247 million with British head of operations Rodney Price paid $1.156 million and Thistle Hotels chief executive Robert Peel paid $1.014 million.  </p>
<p>The packages reflected the international market for top executives, a BIL spokesman said.</p>
<p>"The message for shareholders is that BIL is a multi-national company, it has to pay international prices to attract the best possible talent, and it also has to reflect the fact the company has executives in London, Hong Kong and Sydney, he told The Dominion.</p>
<p>In the past year, shareholders received a gross return of 33 percent through a combination of a 22 percent increase in share price and the payment of a 9 cents a share in dividends.  </p>
<p>Another 24 employees were paid between $300,000 and $830,000 during the 1996 year.</p>
<p>This is the first year New Zealand listed companies had to disclose executive salary packages, which are required under the new Companies Act.</p>
