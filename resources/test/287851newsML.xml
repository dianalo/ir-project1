<p>An International Monetary Fund team returns to Russia next week for talks on the economy, with both sides hopeful that the organization will approve more lending to the country, monetary sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>"The chances (for authorizing another loan tranche) don't look that bad," said one source, who declined to be named.</p>
<p>After delaying loan payments in October and November because of concern about low Russian government revenues, the IMF board decided last month to resume lending to the country, authorizing the release of some $335 million to Moscow.  </p>
<p>In announcing the Dec. 13 decision, an IMF spokesman cited Russia's "improved revenue performance", its sound monetary policy and its steps to restructure the economy.</p>
<p>Sources voiced hopes that Russian government tax revenues last month met the new target of some 25 trillion roubles worked out with the IMF, helping to pave the way for board approval in early February of another tranche for Moscow.</p>
<p>Before releasing additional funds, the IMF will probably also press Russia to give up plans to introduce quotas on vodka and pure alchohol imports this year, sources said.  </p>
<p>"The Fund will not tolerate quotas," one source said.</p>
<p>Smuggling of vodka and alchohol into Russia looks to have grown rapidly last year, robbing the government of trillions of roubles of lost tax revenues.</p>
<p>The IMF team, which is due to leave for Moscow next Monday, will review Russia's economic performance as part of a $10.2 billion, three-year loan agreement struck between the Fund and Moscow in 1995.</p>
<p>Under that agreement, the IMF monitors Russia's economy and economic policy on a monthly basis to see if it is complying with the terms of the loan.  </p>
<p>Besides conducting the regular monthly review, the Fund team is also expected to discuss Russia's economic policies for the coming year.</p>
<p>Late last month, the Russian parliament's lower house approved the third reading of the 1997 draft budget, thus completing the next-to-last stage of the budget process.</p>
<p>The draft envisages a budget deficit of 3.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on revenues of 434.4 trillion roubles and expenditures of 529.8 trillion roubles.</p>
<p>Sources said the IMF is likely to view the revenue forecast as unrealistic, given last year's turnout, and press for a figure it views as more accurate.</p>
<p>The IMF will probably also press Russia to include wage and pension arrears in its calculation of the budget deficit. The government fallen behind on payments to its workers and pensioners because of the shortfall in tax revenues.</p>
<p>Such a move could help boost the deficit as calculated by the IMF to 4 percent or more of GDP, one source speculated.</p>
<p>Although talks on Russia's budget policy for the coming year will not be easy, the IMF could run into even more difficulties in discussing the country's structural economic reforms, which have lagged badly, sources said.</p>
