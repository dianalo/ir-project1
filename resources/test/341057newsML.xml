<p>President Bill Clinton on Wednesday cast doubt on expanding the mission of Bosnia peacekeeping troops to include hunting down war criminals, but said it might be wise to create a separate war crimes strike force to do the job.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at a Pentagon meeting with new Defence Secretary William Cohen and U.S. theatre commanders from around the world, Clinton said such a force must not be involved in peacekeeping duties, nor limited to Bosnia.</p>
<p>"We ought to consider whether there ought to be a permanent war crimes tribunal, which of course would require some sort of way of carrying out its mandate," Clinton said. "But if we do that we need to look at it not just in terms of Bosnia but over the long run."</p>
<p>NATO defence ministers have discussed the possibility of creating an international police force to track down those indicted of war crimes, but have failed to agree on how it might be constituted.</p>
<p>Pentagon and NATO officials have repeatedly balked at the idea of expanding the duties of the current peacekeeping force in Bosnia, mindful of the disastrous consequences when U.N. forces were ordered to take on police actions in Somalia.</p>
<p>"We can't expect people who are sent into a very volatile situation ... to do this other work unless they literally come in contact with those people who should be arrested and returned," said Clinton.</p>
<p>"So there would have to be a completely different way of dealing with this if we're going to have a permanent war crimes tribunal, which I think has a lot of merit."</p>
<p>White House spokesman David Johnson said Clinton was referring to a force whose duties would go beyond Bosnia.</p>
<p>"We need to think about whether we need to have a permanent war crimes tribunal, one that would have worldwide jurisdiction," Johnson said.</p>
<p>"While doing that we need to think about how we would ... have that police function carried out by people who are qualified and able to do it and not have that responsibility confused with the responsibility of those who might be sent into a region to establish security and stability."</p>
<p>Clinton's visit to the Pentagon was his first since Cohen was sworn in last week as the first Republican member of his Cabinet, replacing William Perry as defence secretary.</p>
<p>It came during a semi-annual two-day meeting of senior U.S. generals and admirals in charge of American military forces around the world.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Mike McCurry said Clinton and the military brass wanted to "re-evaluate the requirements of our military force posture as we think about the long-term security issues we confront around the world."</p>
