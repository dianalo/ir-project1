<headline>No breakthrough in Yeltsin's condition - Kremlin.</headline>

<p>Doctors said on Friday Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in hospital with pneumonia, was breathing more easily but there had been no dramatic improvement in his condition, the Kremlin said.</p>
<p>An official statement said the 65-year-old leader's temperature and blood pressure were normal.  </p>
<p>A Kremlin spokeswoman declined to comment on a report by Moscow's Ekho Moskvy radio station quoting hospital sources saying Yeltsin was suffering from an inflammation "of medium gravity" of both lungs.</p>
<p>The Kremlin statement, issued after morning checks by doctors, said: "The president is breathing with more ease, there are less crepitations in his lungs. The temperature remains normal, blood pressure is stable."</p>
<p>"But at the same time doctors think it is too early to speak about a breakthrough."</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who had a major heart operation on November 5, was taken to the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow on Wednesday with what the Kremlin initially described as the first signs of pneumonia. It described his condition as pneumonia on Thursday but gave few details.</p>
