<p>Ethyl Corp said on Wednesday it would not proceed with plans for a US$200 million lawsuit against the Canadian government if Parliament rejects a bill which would effectively ban the gasoline additive MMT.</p>
<p>"We obviously won't move forward if the bill doesn't pass," Chris Hicks, vice president for government relations at Ethyl Canada, told a Senate committee considering the bill.</p>
<p>Ethyl Canada imports MMT, methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl, from its parent Ethyl Corp. No other company in Canada makes or imports MMT, which boosts octane and has been used as a replacement for lead in Canada since 1977.</p>
<p>The Canadian parliament passed a bill in December to ban the import and interprovincial trade of MMT, on the grounds that it hurts cars' emission diagnostic systems and may be unhealthy -- charges Ethyl challenges.</p>
<p>The Senate, which has the power to kill or at least delay the bill, is now considering it.</p>
