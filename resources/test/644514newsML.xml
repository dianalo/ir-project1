<p>Police who answered a bomb scare call on Friday at a post office in Nagano, site of next year's Winter Olympics, nervously opened a beeping parcel to find Japan's hottest toy -- a "virtual pet" electronic bird.</p>
<p>Police said the parcel contained a version of "tamagotchi" -- a chicken-like figure on a small liquid crystal display that is fed and cleaned by pressing buttons and which dies if not properly cared for.</p>
<p>One of 15 bird toys in the parcel sent from abroad had been switched on and had "died" of hunger, triggering the beeping noise noticed by a postal worker.</p>
<p>The toy found in the Nagano parcel was an imitation of the original Tamagotchi, the most popular toy in Japan this year, introduced last November by leading toymaker Bandai Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Tamagotchi's brisk sales, projected to hit 10 million units by the end of the month, have forced Bandai to scramble to meet demand and inspired imitators in Japan and abroad.</p>
<p>The toy's popularity has prompted price-gouging by sellers and been cited in police reports as a motive for robberies and teen prostitution.</p>
<p>This week a school in northern Japan warned female students that older men were using tamagotchi as "bait" to lure them into sexual relations.</p>
<p>Tamagotchi starts life as a bird-like image on the screen of an egg-shaped key-ring device. It develops from a chick to a fully grown adult in around 10 days. However, the owner must feed, groom and soothe the digital creature or else see it waste away and die from neglect.</p>
