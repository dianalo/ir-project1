<p>British oil production fell for the fourth month in succession in April as several platforms underwent planned maintenance work, industry newsletter Aberdeen Petroleum Report (APR) said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>U.K. crude and natural gas liquids output in April fell to 2.485 million barrels a day (bpd) down 107,000 bpd from 2.592 million in March, APRs survey of North Sea operators found.</p>
<p>Production was 256,000 bpd below a recent high set in December at 2.741 million. Output fell to 2.608 million in February.</p>
<p>Average output from the Brent field fell to 115,000 bpd from 169,000 bpd in March as the Brent Delta platfrom was taken out of commission as part of a long-term redevelopment programme.</p>
<p>Other fields registering lower supply in April included British Petroleum's Miller, Enterprise's Nelson and Amerada Hess' Scott/Telford.</p>
<p>April figures reflected the first full month of production from Texaco's new Captain field (25,000 bpd) and first data from Phillips' J-Block which came on stream on April 21 (9,600 bpd).</p>
