<p>Nesher Israel Cement Enterprises said it planned to invest $175 million over the next two-and-a-half years to build a dry-process production line at its Ramle plant, near Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Nesher chairman Yossi Rosen said in a statement that the new production line, with a planned daily capacity of 5,000 tonnes, was part of the company's long-term strategy of shifting all its facilties over to dry-process from wet-process by the year 2001. Its first production line was converted to dry process at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>Rosen said the company was seeking approvals to replace wet-process lines at its second plant near Haifa to dry process. Construction is slated to begin in 1999.</p>
<p>The company said its dry-process lines incorporated the latest technological advances in cement production and that they would reduce production costs and cause less environmental damage.</p>
<p>Nesher, which is controlled by Mashab, a joint venture between Koor Industries Ltd and Clal Industries Ltd, is Israel's sole producer of cement.</p>
