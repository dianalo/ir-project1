<p>Japan voiced regret on Monday over an attack on Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's motorcade and said it would call on the military government to show restraint in dealing with the Nobel laureate.</p>
<p>"There had been signs that communications channels between the (Burmese) government and Suu Kyi were being restored," top government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama told a news conference.</p>
<p>"Therefore, it is extremely regrettable that the incident happened," he said.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi's motorcade came under attack by a group of unidentified stone-throwers on Saturday as she was travelling to meet hundreds of supporters near a police checkpoint. Suu Kyi, who was not hurt in the incident, said the attack was orchestrated by the government.</p>
<p>"We will continue to ask the Myanmar (Burma) government for restraint," Kajiyama said.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi and the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) have been engaged in a standoff over her demand for greater democracy in Burma since her release in July 1995 from six years of house arrest.</p>
<p>SLORC has detained and then released hundreds of her party supporters and members at various times to pressure her.</p>
