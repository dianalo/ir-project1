<p>Profit margins at sophisticated or complex refineries rose $1 a barrel in Asia last year and 35 cents a barrel in Europe from 1995 levels, Royal Dutch/Shell said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But the full impact of recently comissioned plants in Asia has yet to be fully felt and in Europe gains last year were due to firm middle distillates which more than offset weak gasoline prices.</p>
<p>Shell expected refineries to continue to lighten the types of crude oil run they processed and said surplus gasoline production was likely to persist.</p>
<p>The company said that there may be some erosion of margins this spring as seasonal demand for oil products began to fall.</p>
<p>Refining in Europe in the Shell group benefited from the stronger industry margins relative to the fourth quarter of 1995. And in Asia, performance was affected by major maintenance programmes.</p>
