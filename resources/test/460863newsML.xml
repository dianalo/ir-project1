<p>Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh left Singapore on Friday after a two-day visit aimed at boosting ties and eliminating what he called image problems, but giving no details of how either would be achieved.</p>
<p>Chavalit called Singapore "one of Thailand's most important economic partners" in his only public pronouncement during the state visit, an interview with Singapore's Straits Times newspaper on Thursday.</p>
<p>He declined all other opportunities to talk to reporters about the problems he perceives in the relationship between the two countries and the discussions he had had on the subject with Singaporean ministers.</p>
<p>Singapore is Thailand's most important trading partner in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which also includes Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Two way-trade reached an estimated US$7.7 billion to US$11.5 billion in 1996. There are also about 50,000 Thai workers in Singapore, most of them in the construction industry.</p>
<p>Chavalit returned home to continued financial sector turmoil after Thai economic authorities ordered 10 finance firms hard-hit by a liquidity crunch to raise capital.</p>
<p>The order sparked a public run deposits of several finance companies and commercial banks. About US$752.7 million had been withdrawn from Thai finance firms between March 5 and March 17.</p>
