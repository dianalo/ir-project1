<text>
<p>Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. Tuesday narrowly won control over Clyde Petroleum Plc, bringing to a close one of the bitterest takeover battles in the oil industry in recent years.</p>
<p>The Canadian firm said it held 51.42 percent of Clyde Petroleum shares after its 494 million pound ($793 million) offer closed at midday.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Clyde gives Gulf Canada a firm base in the North Sea, exposure to Australia and a bigger presence in Indonesia, which already was one of its core areas.</p>
<p>Clyde is the international acquisition Gulf Canada was planning for some time to complement its Canadian and Indonesian operations.</p>
<p>The oil exploration and production sector has seen a flow of takeovers worldwide in the past 18 months and industry analysts say more bids will undoubtedly follow.</p>
<p>After years of cost-cutting to fight depressed oil prices, many oil firms have well-filled war chests to make acquistions to replace or expand oil and gas reserves.</p>
