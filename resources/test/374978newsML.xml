<p>South Africa's coal mining giant Ingwe said on Thursday it expected its results for the six months to June 1997 to be similar to those of the six months to December 1996 due to continued productivity and cost containment.</p>
<p>The company said market conditions in the Far East and Europe were uncertain and it had yet to conclude contract negotiations with several Japanese power utilities.</p>
<p>The firm would also be affected by volatile prices in Europe despite a reasonable balance in supply and demand.</p>
<p>"Notwithstanding these uncertain market conditions, because of continued productivity improvement and cost containment the directors are of the view that the results for the six month period to June 1997 should be similar to those of the six months to December 1996," it said at the presentation of its interims.</p>
<p>The company announced sharply higher share earnings of 159 cents for the half year to December 1996, a 50 percent rise from 106 cents during the same period in 1995. It pegged its interim dividend at 50 cents versus 35 cents previously.</p>
<p>Ingwe managing director David Murray said cost reductions and a weaker rand had helped to boost interim earnings.</p>
<p>He said the firm's Coal Mines Australia Ltd (CMAL), which it bought last year, was unlikely to make a significant contribution to earnings per share in the next two years as it expanded.</p>
<p>Thereafter, he said, projections indicated a positive impact on earnings.</p>
<p>Murray said Ingwe's acquisition of CMAL set the platform on for further international buys. "We believe that any exporting coal company in the future is going to have to have legs in many countries to be competitive. That's the way we see ourselves going - internationalising in a serious way," he said.</p>
<p>Murray said Ingwe saw huge growth potential in CMAL with the capacity to expand low cost opencast production at its Bayswater Colliery, providing Australian mining expertise for Ingwe's Togara south development in central Queensland and the future potential of the Wyong reserve, also in Australia.</p>
<p>"I think it's (Wyong reserve) going to be one of the big mines of the future. It's thick, it's deep with proven good quality which Asian markets like very much," Murray said.</p>
<p>Murray also said Ingwe was mulling its participation in the privatisation of South American firm Carbocol. It had also identified two areas of interest in Indonesia and was close to concluding a memorandum of understanding on one of them.</p>
<p>On negotiations for South African supplies to Japanese power utlities, Murray said there was pressure on South Africa to meet Australia's benchmark of $2.65 down.</p>
<p>"There's been a settlement at a lower price (between the Australians and the Japanese). It's down $2.65 on their benchmark $38," he said.</p>
<p>"We are trying to catch up with some of the discount that's still on the South African price but I don't think it will be as severe as $2.65. That's been generally accepted in Australia," he said.</p>
<p>He declined to say when the negotiations with the Japanese utilities were likely to be concluded.</p>
<p>In Europe, he said the company expected prices to slightly less than rollover.</p>
