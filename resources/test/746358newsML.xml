<headline>Exiles call on Kohl to help jailed Iranian writer.</headline>

<p>A group of exiled Iranian writers urged Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday to intervene in the planned trial of an Iranian newspaper editor charged by Tehran with spying for Germany.</p>
<p>The German-based Iranian Association of Authors (in Exile) sent an open letter to Kohl asking him to protest against the jailing of Faraj Sarkuhi, editor of the monthly Adineh (Friday). Sarkuhi was arrested in April.</p>
<p>"Despite world-wide protests and the efforts of your government, Sarkuhi is still in jail," the group told Kohl.</p>
<p>It urged him to use all means at his disposal to influence the case and said he could at the very least demand that Sarkuhi's trial, announced last month and due to take place soon, be observed by an international commission.</p>
<p>The writers said Tehran's decision to put Sarkuhi on trial was a direct reaction to a verdict by a German court in April that Iran's leadership ordered the killing of a group of Iranian Kurdish dissidents in Berlin in 1992.</p>
<p>Iran denies involvement in the killings.</p>
<p>Bonn feels some responsibility for Sarkuhi because his wife has received asylum in Germany. It had been in regular contact with Tehran over the case.</p>
<p>But after downgrading relations with Iran following the Berlin court ruling, it said it could no longer intercede for him.</p>
<p>The exiled writers slammed Bonn's approach.</p>
<p>"To our amazement your government is continuing close co-operation with Iran, although German justice put Iranian state terrorism on the record," the group wrote.</p>
<p>"What makes us sorry is that your economic interests take precedence over human rights. That is what world public opinion will condemn you for if anything happens to Sarkuhi."</p>
<p>In a letter smuggled out of Iran, Sarkuhi said he had been held for six weeks and tortured by the Iranian secret service in Tehran late last year to force him to confess to spying for Germany.</p>
<p>Last week Iran's own Islamic Human Rights Commission said Sarkuhi had written to it confessing to certain violations of the law and rejecting interference by foreign governments including Germany. It also said he would be tried in open court.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based group Human Rights Watch said in an open letter last month to the head of Iran's judiciary, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, that it feared the charges might have been brought to punish Sarkuhi for his activities as a writer and to intimidate other independent-minded writers in Iran.</p>
