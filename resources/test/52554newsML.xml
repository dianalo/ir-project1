<p>Russia's bank creditors have agreed in principle to reschedule debts of over $20 billion, the critical mass needed for a global rescheduling of $35 billion of debt to go ahead, Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said on Friday.  </p>
<p>"By preliminary estimates the amount of debt declared by the banks agreeing to take part exceeds $20 billion of the principal," Kasyanov told Reuters.</p>
<p>"As we know, for the agreement to become valid, for the restructuring to take place, we need to accumulate the sum of $20 billion."</p>
<p>Russia agreed last year with the London Club of commercial bank creditors to reschedule $35 billion of debt inherited from the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Banks had until August 27 to sign up for the deal, and since then the two sides have been reconciling individual banks' commitments to the deal with the more than 3,000 loans involved.  </p>
<p>Kasyanov said the former Soviet foreign trade bank Vneshekonombank, which is responsible for the debt, would need another week to check the details, and complete reconciliation of the commitments would take a further two months.</p>
<p>"We can announce today that the agreement will take place before the end of this year," he said.</p>
<p>A London Club rescheduling, together with a rescheduling of former Soviet debt to members of the Paris Club of government creditors, which is now in progress, and a loan from the International Monetary Fund signed earlier this year, are seen as vital for Russia's hopes to issue a Eurobond.</p>
<p>Kasyanov said the Eurobond would be issued in late October or early November.</p>
<p>Russian officials have said that a U.S. credit rating agency, which Western bankers said was Standard &amp; Poor's, visited Moscow this week to prepare a rating for the bond.</p>
<p>Other Russian officials have said Russia would issue a first $300-$500 million Eurobond later this year.</p>
<p>A draft of the 1997 budget said Russia plans to raise a total $1.3 billion in Eurobonds next year.</p>
<p>Russia has mandated JP Morgan and SBC Warburg to manage the issue.</p>
