<p>The introduction of the electronic Johannesburg Equities Trading system had boosted the frequency with which shares were traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), the exchange said on Monday.</p>
<p>It said on average there was trade in 57 percent of the 824 securities listed on the exchange on any one day during September compared with 37 percent in September 1995.</p>
<p>Annualised liquidity on the JSE had increased to 9.9 percent for the nine months to September 30 1996, compared to 6.8 percent for the same period last year.</p>
<p>Other factors which had boosted liquidity were overall market conditions, the halving of marketable securities tax to 0.5 percent and the restructuring of the JSE, the exchange said.</p>
