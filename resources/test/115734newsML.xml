<p>Cement and building materials group Holderbank Financiere Glaris AG said on Monday it was launching a sponsored Level 1 American Depositary Receipts (ADR) programme, effective immediately.  </p>
<p>Holderbank said in a statement the ADRs would enable new categories of U.S. investors to acquire its existing bearer stock through a U.S. dollar denominated security.</p>
<p>"A Level 1 ADR does not entail the issuance of new bearer shares, only the creation of U.S. dollar certificates on existing Holderbank bearer shares," it added.</p>
<p>It said the Bank of New York was the depositary and transfer agent.</p>
<p>Holderbank said U.S. investors who had been barred by their own by-laws of for other reasons from buying Holderbank shares directly on the Swiss Exchange could now buy ADRs.</p>
<p>It said the ADR offered advantages to U.S. investors over directly holding Swiss shares, including convenience, cost, enhanced liquidity, easier share transfers and dividend collection and payment in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>Holderbank is the world's biggest supplier of cement, aggregates, ready-mixed concrete and concrete chemicals as well as construction-related services.</p>
