<p>North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt told the state's tobacco growers Friday that he would fight to block efforts by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate the industry.</p>
<p>"The FDA has no place in our tobacco fields," Hunt told the annual meeting of the Tobacco Growers Association of North Carolina.</p>
<p>His comments support the tobacco industry's position in a key courtroom fight against federal regulation set for Monday when manufacturers will argue the FDA has no jurisdiction over cigarettes.</p>
<p>The dispute stems from August 1995, when President Clinton authorised the FDA to regulate how cigarettes are sold and marketed in a bid to curb smoking among children.</p>
<p>Hunt, who has joined with other tobacco-state governors in a lawsuit against the FDA's plans to regulate tobacco as a drug, fears the agency could put growers out of business.</p>
<p>North Carolina outpaced the nation in tobacco growth in 1995, yielding more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>Results for 1996 were not yet available.</p>
<p>Hunt said he has told Clinton the FDA's approach was wrong. "Now we don't want children to be using this product. It's wrong. But the FDA is not the way to handle this problem," Hunt said.</p>
<p>"I have pressed Clinton to adopt an alternative approach. Let's have tougher laws to prevent teens from smoking. And there should be stronger educational efforts targeted toward children."</p>
<p>The FDA rules would ban free samples and billboard ads near schools and playgrounds, limit vending machine sales, ban sponsorship of sports events and the use of cigarette brands on hats, T-shirts and other products.</p>
<p>Joining tobacco companies as plaintiffs are the American Advertising Federation and the National Association of Convenience Stores.</p>
<p>At Friday's annual meeting Gov. Hunt told growers that they need to campaign strongly against teen smokers -- just as strongly as the FDA.</p>
<p>"Tobacco provides our state with jobs, food on the table and sends our kids to college," Hunt said.</p>
<p>He said this year could be a banner year for growers, provided there were "no droughts, no hurricanes and no FDA."</p>
