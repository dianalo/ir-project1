<p>U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry said on Tuesday predictions of a new military peacekeeping force in Bosnia next year were premature and there would be no commitment to U.S. participation until all proposals were studied.</p>
<p>His statement to reporters ahead of a two-day meeting of NATO defence ministers beginning on Wednesday to discuss Bosnia and other issues mirrored continuing caution by the Clinton administration in a presidential election year.</p>
<p>"I think all such judgments are premature. I really do," Perry said of predictions by German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe and others that a new international force would go to Bosnia next year to replace the NATO-led peace force (IFOR) of over 50,000 troops due to withdraw this December.</p>
<p>"In the last analysis, they (other countries) will reserve their final judgment until they see what the requests are," Perry added.</p>
<p>"I don't think we (the United States) can have a position until we see what the request is, what the mission is, what the force structure requested is."</p>
<p>The United States currently has 15,000 troops in Bosnia and President Bill Clinton and other administration officials have refused to predict any new mission next year ahead of a November presidential vote in the United States.</p>
<p>Perry stressed to reporters travelling with him from Copenhagen on the last leg of a trip to four Nordic countries that no Bosnia decision would be made at the informal Wednesday and Thursday NATO meeting in Bergen.</p>
<p>The defence chiefs, he said, will begin laying military plans and consider alternative strategies to prevent war from breaking out again in Bosnia. The proposals would be presented to the North Atlantic Council, the political arm of NATO, for a decision in December.</p>
<p>Ruehe said this week that he expected a new Bosnia mission to include 20,000 to 25,000 troops and that Germany was prepared to provide 2,000 to 3,000 of its own troops in such a force.</p>
<p>He told a meeting on Baltic security in Copenhagen on Tuesday that Russia was apparently prepared to provide troops for such a force, just as it has in the current force.</p>
<p>"There are encouraging signs that Russia will be on board for a follow-on mission to IFOR," Ruehe said.</p>
<p>Russian Defence Minister Igor Rodionov will attend a special Thursday session of the two-day NATO meeting. He and Perry will hold  bilateral talks following that session.</p>
<p>Rodionov, Perry and Norway's Defence Minister Joergen Kosmo will also sign an agreement on Thursday under which the three nations will cooperate to clean up nuclear and other waste dumped or stored by Russia's military in the Arctic.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. defence official said Perry looked forward to private talks with Rodionov on continued bilateral and other cooperation with Russia, which grew out of close ties between Perry and former Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev.</p>
<p>Grachev was sacked by President Boris Yeltsin this summer in a domestic shakeup over the military's handling of the bloody war in Chechnya.</p>
