<headline>Noranda schedules lead shutdown in Sept.</headline>

<p>Noranda Inc has scheduled a two-week shutdown at its Belledune smelter in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia in the second and third weeks of September for planned maintanence, a Noranda executive told Reuters.</p>
<p>The shutdown was planned into the smelter's production schedule, so it doesn't affect the facility's 1997 production estimate, which is 115,000 tonnes of lead.</p>
<p>But the shutdown does coincide with the beginning of the season of heavy battery production, which accounts for most of the world's lead consumption. Consequently, the U.S. lead market could tighten more than usual come September, dealers said.</p>
<p>The battery season typically begins in September and ends in January.</p>
<p>"Ideally, you want your shutdown in the beginning of the summer rather than the tail end of the summer," said Tom Schnull, manager of Noranda's lead department. "In this case, we needed to coordinate the shutdown with a series of other maintanence work in New Brunswick."</p>
<p>Many lead producers are believed to be sold out of material as the battery season approaches, which is leading to higher premiums, despite falling prices on the London Metal Exchange.</p>
<p>Lead premiums are 2.50-3.50 cents over the LME cash price, which has fallen 5 percent in the last 10 trading days to 26.88 cents a lb.</p>
