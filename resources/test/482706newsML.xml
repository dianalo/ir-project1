<text>
<p>Novadigm Inc said on Tuesday that it expects to report a "substantial operating loss" for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 1997, since revenues are expected to be below expectations.</p>
<p>The company said that total revenues are expected to be approximately $6.5 to $7 million.</p>
<p>Detailed final results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year will be announced on or about April 30, 1997.</p>
<p>In last year's fourth quarter, Novadigm reported a profit of $0.11 a share on revenues of $8.2 million.</p>
<p>Revenues were lower than planned largely due to a revision in contract terms between Novadigm and Amdahl Corp, combined with continuing smaller initial commitments by customers as pilots for their enterprise-wide requirements.</p>
<p>The Amdahl agreement renews their strategic relationship through the year 2000 and has been restructured to provide for $2 million of royalties for the quarter ending March 31, 1997 and recognition of royalties from Amdahl on a quarterly sell-through basis.</p>
<p>Novadigm said it will also post a $1 million restructuring charge from staff reductions, the consolidation of offices and other savings beginning in the June quarter.</p>
