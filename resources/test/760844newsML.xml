<p>The Bank of Israel's decision to hold its key lending rate for August steady at 12.7 percent was expected and will not affect trading on Tuesday, analysts said.</p>
<p>"The rate decision came as no surprise since we were all sure that the Bank of Israel will leave its key lending rate unchanged," said Julien Assous of Sahar Securities. "The market did not expect a change in rates, and the decision will not affect trading on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Though the unchanged rate decision was expected, some analysts were still worried an interest rate rise may be imminent.</p>
<p>"The decision was expected and is a wise one. The central bank has decided to wait and see what the next CPI (consumer price index) will be and not to have a zig zag interest rate policy. But there is still uncertainty about the next CPI," said Ilan Shabat, investment adviser at Israel Discount Bank.</p>
<p>"If the dollar continues to rise, we may have an interest rate hike in the future," Shabat said.</p>
<p>But in the near-term, he said stocks should benefit from the decision to leave rate steady.</p>
<p>"I think the stock market will use this unchanged interest rate as an excuse to continue to rise because the fear of a rate increase has disappered for another month," he said.</p>
