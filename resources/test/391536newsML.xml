<p>French police on Thursday detained three hunters on suspicion that one of them had shot dead one of the Pyrenees mountains' few surviving bears three years ago, justice sources said.</p>
<p>State Prosecutor Jean-Pierre Peino said the hunters were in police custody in the southwestern town of Pau and will be handed over to an investigating judge who will decide whether to press charges of destroying a protected specie.</p>
<p>The charge carries up to six months in prison and a fine of up to 60,000 francs ($12,000).</p>
<p>Many bears once roamed the Pyrenees border range between France and Spain. Experts now believe they are down to five or six, and authorities recently imported two bears from Slovenia to try rebuild the population.</p>
