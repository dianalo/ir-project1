<p>Food giant RJR Nabisco is poised to crumble in the face of angry Mainers upset about the culinary downsizing of their favourite chowder cracker.</p>
<p>Nabisco officials have scheduled an announcement for Wednesday in Boston to respond to a campaign to save the Crown Pilot cracker, which the company stopped baking last May after 204 years of production.</p>
<p>Residents of Chebeague Island, which is located about 15 miles from Portland, rallied in defence of Crown Pilots and received national publicity for their plea for people to call Nabisco's consumer telephone hotline.</p>
<p>The company would not say officially what decision it has made on the Crown Pilot's fate, but in scheduling the news conference Nabisco cited the "loyalty" of the cracker's fans and recounted the product's historic roots and culinary attributes.</p>
<p>Crown Pilots were introduced in 1792 at a Newburyport, Mass., bakery, which became part of Nabisco - the National Biscuit Company - in 1898. The cracker was Nabisco's oldest product line.</p>
