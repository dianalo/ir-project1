<p>A huge share handout by some of Britain's major building societies this year will give the housing market another lift as well as fuelling consumer spending, said stockmarket analysts.</p>
<p>They estimate as much as 8.0 billion pounds ($13.07 billion) could be cashed from an expected 18 billion pounds worth of shares due to be handed to millions of building society members.</p>
<p>In many cases the giveaway will boost the pockets of windfall recipients by over 1,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Much of this is likely to be spent on expensive white goods such as fridges, washing machines and the like, while the sale of personal computers, clothes, holidays abroad and even cars are all seen benefiting from flotation proceeds.</p>
<p>"I think the anecdotal evidence points towards people seeing it (the share giveaway) as a bit of a windfall gain and therefore being more inclined to spend it," said Ian Williams, equity strategist at stockbroker Panmure Gordon.</p>
<p>The list of stock market flotations include Halifax Building Society, Woolwich Building Society, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Northern Rock plus a 600 million pounds payout from the Bristol and West Building Society after it merges with the Bank of Ireland.</p>
<p>The flotation of the Halifax, Britain's largest mortgage lender, could be worth as much as 12 billion pounds on its own, while the Woolwich is likely to hand-out an average 1,233 pounds to members when it converts in July.</p>
<p>Analysts expect around two thirds of the total payout will be saved with some of this likely to find its way into the accounts of other building societies that are remaining mutually owned.</p>
<p>But, providing consumer confidence is not dented by the election which must be held by May 1, there is a growing belief that some of this cash will be invested by consumers in buying a home or home improvement.</p>
<p>"The perception among this group of individuals will be that housing has passed its worst," said Savvas Savouri, equity stategist at Credit Lyonnais Laing in London.</p>
<p>"Many will have been in a position where they have not been able to move for six or seven years because they were not willing to sell a house they value far higher," he added.</p>
<p>Williams at Panmure concurred, "The housing market is looking like an obvious candidate, it is picking up anyway and cashing the shares is an ideal way to get their deposits."</p>
<p>This recovery story is already reflected in the performance of shares linked to the housing market.</p>
<p>The obvious beneficiaries so far have been housebuilders like Persimmon, which has seen its shares climb to 257 pence from 204 in December, and Barratt Developments, trading at 280 pence from a low of 222 pence in November.</p>
<p>Building suppliers like Marley and Rugby Group plus the estate agents like Hambro Countrywide are also expected to reap the benefits, said analysts.</p>
<p>In fact the initial flood of new building society shares onto the market could boost the stockmarket as a whole.</p>
<p>"There may be a little temptation, particularly as their is a lot of talk of institutions having to buy them (building societies) to get their weightings up, that people might be inclined to hang on a bit longer," said Williams at Panmure.</p>
<p>He said these investors might well be tempted to reinvest in the stockmarket as the flotations will emphasise that the "comparitive rates on most savings products at the moment are pretty uncompetitive."</p>
