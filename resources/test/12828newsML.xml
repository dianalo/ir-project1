<p>Moslem villagers on Saturday came to the aid of Hindu pilgrims stranded by heavy snow and driving rain on a rugged Himalayan route after 96 people died from exposure, Indian officials said.</p>
<p>Thousands of devout Hindus began an annual trek to the Amarnath cave last week to worship a stalgamite believed to be the manifestation of the phallus of the Hindu god Shiva. But the procession was hit by heavy rain and snow.</p>
<p>Among the dead were many naked "sadhus", or Hindu holy men who smear their bodies with ash.</p>
<p>"The main reason for these deaths is that the pilgrims were not equipped with warm clothing and most of the holy men who died were trekking naked," said Asrar Ahmad, a doctor at a pilgrim camp in Anantnag, 50 km (30 miles) south of Srinagar.</p>
<p>Rescue attempts were hindered by bad weather on the approach to the cave 3,880 metres (12,725 ft) high in the Himalayas.</p>
<p>"Due to torrential rains and snowfall the helicopters with rescue teams could not land at any place in the region," K.B. Jandial, spokesman for the Jammu and Kashmir state government, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"But we have received reports that local villagers are helping more and more pilgrims to trek down from high altitude areas," he said.</p>
<p>Army officials said they were providing shelter and aid to nearly 40,000 pilgrims at army camps set up along the route.</p>
<p>"We have distributed thousands of food packets," said Lt-Col Anil Bhatt, a public relations officer in New Delhi. "Eight army mobile hospitals are busy treating the trekkers for exposure."</p>
<p>Bhatt said army personnel escorted the trekkers down the slopes, carrying the ill and injured through pouring rain.</p>
<p>An official statement said thousands of trekkers stranded in the upper reaches had safely made their way down to Pahalgam town, the base camp for the trek.</p>
<p>"Villagers are taking the pilgrims into their homes, giving them food and blankets and warm clothing," said senior police official A.K. Suri, who flew over the area in a helicopter on Saturday but was unable to land because of the poor weather.</p>
<p>Over 112,000 Hindus arrived in Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Moslem-majority state, for the trek.</p>
<p>Scheduled to end on Wednesday, the trek was suspended until weather conditions improved.</p>
<p>The cave's entrance was deep in 33 cm (13 inches) of snow, a weather department official said. Since Friday, 85 mm (3.3 inches) of rain has lashed Srinagar, the state's summer capital.</p>
<p>Rescue teams tried unsucessfully to land medicines and other essentials for more than 3,000 people stranded at Panchtarni, 3,700 metres (12,136 ft) high, spokesman Jandial said.</p>
<p>"They are at the mercy of nature," he added.</p>
<p>Teams of Indian paramilitary forces set to work to clear the 300-km (200-mile) highway between Srinagar and Jammu in the south. The job was expected to take three days.</p>
<p>About 25,000 people were stranded in Jammu, the state's winter capital, after floods and landslides caused by torrential rains blocked the highway.</p>
<p>Last year the pilgrimage was threatened by Moslem separatist guerrillas who staged two bomb attacks on the heavily guarded pilgrims. A state civil servant was killed in one of the blasts.</p>
<p>Some 20,000 people have died since a separatist revolt broke out in 1990 in Jammu and Kashmir, police and hospital sources say. This year guerrillas issued no ban on the pilgrimage. Instead, bad weather has endangered the pilgrims' lives.</p>
