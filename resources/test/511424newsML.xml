<p>-----------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - April 15--------------</p>
<p>Gold is seen probing key $345 support, but analysts were divided on whether it would bounce or break through the important floor, which could send it slipping further.</p>
<p>Silver was also feeling downside pressure and could test support at $4.65.  </p>
<p>GOLD -</p>
<p>The market remained under pressure, with spot gold edging down to a fresh low bid of $345.20 in early activity on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The $345 area is critical support, but I think it will bounce," said technical analyst Karen Jones of Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
<p>"But rallies need to get above $350 to make any impression at all on what can only be described as a dense wall of resistance," she added.</p>
<p>Others, though, including analyst Martin Squires of broker Rudolf Wolff believed that gold had lower to go.</p>
<p>"A descending triangle is developing...suggesting further downside movements can be expected," he said, referring to the April Comex contract.</p>
<p>"The technical indicators are weakening, in confirmation of further downside tests," he said, adding that players should wait for a confirmed breakout before taking up a position.</p>
<p>Most analysts agreed that a breach of $345 would trigger stops and send prices down to $340, and then possibly to February's lows of $336.15.</p>
<p>At 0845 GMT spot gold was quoted at $345.60/345.90, down about 40 cents from Monday's New York close.</p>
<p>SILVER -</p>
<p>The market is likely to consolidate with a downward bias, as indicators continue to show the market is oversold.</p>
<p>The 14-day RSI dipped to 27.0 early on Tuesday from 27.5 on Monday and 28.0 on Friday.</p>
<p>Nearby support was pegged at Friday's low of $4.70, with further support seen at the April 3 nadir of $4.65.</p>
<p>"We have very good support around $4.62, the support we saw at the beginning of the year. I think we can see the market bounce from this area," said Jones.</p>
<p>A break of $4.60/$4.62 would herald a dive all the way to $4.33, the lows of $1995, she added.</p>
<p>Resistance was pegged at $4.80, and then $4.84, a breach of which would be needed to move higher.</p>
<p>At 0845 GMT spot silver was quoted at $4.71/4.73, down one cent from Monday's New York close.</p>
<p>PLATINUM -</p>
<p>The market would stay within its wide $360-$375 range for the time being, with pressure sending it to the bottom of the price band.</p>
<p>At 0845 GMT spot platinum was quoted at $365.25/366.25, down $1.45 from Monday's New York close.</p>
