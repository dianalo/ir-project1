<p>A California man pleaded guilty on Thursday to conspiracy for his role in an alleged high-tech spy ring, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>David Biehl, 38, president of the now-defunct Semiconductor Spares Inc. (SSI), pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring with two other men to obtain drawings of spare parts belonging to Applied Materials Inc, the U.S. Attorney's office said.</p>
<p>The three allegedly conspired to use the drawings to make and sell parts in competition with Applied Materials, a semiconductor equipment maker, it said.</p>
<p>Biehl, of Redwood City, California, entered the guilty plea at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte in San Jose.</p>
<p>As part of a plea agreement, Biehl also admitted to similar conduct involving confidential spare parts drawings diverted from two other Silicon Valley firms, Varian Associates Inc and Lam Research Corp, the U.S. Attorney's office said.</p>
<p>SSI made more than $5 million in revenue by using the spare parts drawings diverted from the three companies, according to an indictment in the case.</p>
<p>Biehl, expected to be sentenced early next year, faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a $250,000 fine and restitution.</p>
<p>Biehl's co-defendants -- Martin Calara, a senior planner at Applied Materials, and John Green, an SSI marketing representative -- have entered not guilty pleas and are awaiting trial, the U.S. Attorney's office said.</p>
<p>Three other men have pleaded guilty to mail or wire fraud charges in connection with the case, it said.</p>
