<p>Police workers donned protective suits and gloves Wednesday to dig through the world's largest garbage dump in search of the body of a girl allegedly killed in an exorcism, police said.</p>
<p>An area of Fresh Kills landfill has been cordoned off since the weekend after being identified as the likely site of the body of 5-year-old Amy Burney. New York City authorities charged the child's mother and grandmother with murdering her in late April during an exorcism that went wrong.</p>
<p>The child was allegedly fed a deadly mix of ammonia, vinegar, olive oil, cayenne pepper and black pepper by her mother and grandmother, who said they wanted to exorcise "demons" out of her, police said.</p>
<p>The mother and grandmother put her body in a garbage bag on the curb which was picked up by trash collectors, police said.</p>
<p>The body is feared to have been dumped by a garbage truck in the Fresh Kills landfill in New York City's borough of Staten Island. Fresh Kills is the world's biggest landfill.</p>
<p>Authorities narrowed the site of her inadvertent burial to an area in the dump 250 feet (75 metres) by 100 feet (30 metres) by 15 feet (4.5 metres) deep.</p>
<p>Workers from the Police Department's emergency services started searching Wednesday, at first using digging equipment to spread out the garbage. Most of the work was expected to be done by hand, police said.</p>
<p>The child's grandmother, Rosa Wilkerson, 45, and mother Angelic Burney, 25, were arraigned Monday on murder charges. They were also accused of failing to report the girl's death and the removal of her body.</p>
<p>Police began looking for the missing girl last week after child welfare workers said her mother would not reveal her whereabouts.</p>
