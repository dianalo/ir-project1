<p>A strike by French train conductors was set to disrupt rail traffic for a fifth day on Sunday, prolonging travellers' misery over a long holiday weekend despite a decision by some strikers to go back to work.</p>
<p>State railway company SNCF said one in three trains were cancelled on its main lines on Saturday and most inter-city routes would be similarly disrupted on Sunday.</p>
<p>High-speed Eurostar trains to London through the Channel Tunnel were unaffected but the strike did hit a third of traffic on the Thalys express service linking Paris and Brussels.</p>
<p>By Monday, however, the SNCF expected to be running a near normal service and urged all of its conductors to resume work.</p>
<p>"There is no reason to keep up the strike because we have made a considerable effort, without precedent, for the conductors," SNCF chairman Louis Gallois told French television.</p>
<p>Despite talk of a breakthrough on Friday, the strike dragged into the Pentecost weekend after most conductors voted to reject concessions won by unions in negotiations with the SNCF.</p>
<p>Traffic jams built up on some motorways on Saturday as extra holidaymakers took to the roads for the three-day break.</p>
<p>Conductors on Saturday called off their action at one Paris mainline station, Montparnasse, as well as a number of provincial terminals including Rennes and Marseille.</p>
<p>But others extended the strike at the capital's Gare de Lyon and the cities of Montpellier and Bordeaux in southern France.</p>
<p>The SNCF has agreed to promote an extra 860 of the current 10,000 conductors and hire 200 more this year as well as raise their monthly bonus to 900 francs ($155) from 700 francs ($120) by year-end and to 1,000 francs ($170) early next year.</p>
<p>But, in a rift between unions, the hardline Sud-Rail, kept out of talks because it represents a minority of staff, said on Saturday the concessions fell far short of its demands.</p>
<p>"Instead of indulging in propaganda, the management must negotiate," it said in a statement urging a longer strike.</p>
<p>The Socialist-backed CFDT union, France's largest, said it had won significant concesssions and urged its members to examine the whole package on offer when voting their next move.</p>
<p>The SNCF apologised to its travellers and said the strike would badly hurt the company.</p>
<p>The conductors staged a similar strike last month in another sign of opposition to austerity policies of the centre-right government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe.</p>
