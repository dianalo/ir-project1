<text>
<p>British Airways World Cargo said Thursday it had not yet made any decision to drop cargo surcharges it introduced from November 8 last year.</p>
<p>Since then, the carrier has been charging a six UK pence per kg charge on intercontinental freight rates and three pence per kg on European and UK routes.</p>
<p>During October/November 1996, many airlines introduced cargo surcharges to counter rapidly rising fuel costs.</p>
<p>Recently, three major international airlines -- Delta, Virgin Atlantic and United -- announced they are dropping surcharges.</p>
<p>American Airlines and Air Canada have, like BA, said they will continue to levy surcharges until further notice while other carriers are discussing the situation. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 7706 Fax +5017</p>
