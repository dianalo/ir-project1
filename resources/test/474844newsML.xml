<p>Taiwan Synthetic Rubber Co said on Friday it would invest T$2 billion to build a thermo-plastic elastomer plant in southern Kaohsiung county to meet growing overseas demand.</p>
<p>"To cope with rising demand from mainland China and Southeast Asia, we plan to expand our thermo-plastic elastomer production by building a T$2 billion plant," company vice-president Chen Tsai-teh told Reuters.</p>
<p>The firm was applying for government permits and hoped to start construction by the end of 1997, he said.</p>
<p>Construction of the plant, with a designed annual production capacity of 50,000 tonnes of thermo-plastic elastomer, will take a year and a half, Chen said.</p>
<p>The company's existing thermo-plastic elastomer plant can turn out 55,000 tonnes a year, he said.</p>
<p>Thermo-plastic elastomer is a raw material for producing shoe soles and water-proof products.</p>
