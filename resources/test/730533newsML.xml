<p>Bulgaria's former communist dictator Todor Zhivkov published a 700-page volume of memoirs on Tuesday, revealing that his greatest regret was failing to resist perestroika political reforms.</p>
<p>Zhivkov, now 85, ruled Bulgaria for 35 years until his removal in a bloodless coup in 1989.</p>
<p>A one-time associate of late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu, he is one of Eastern Europe's last living communist leaders.</p>
<p>Now, more than seven years after the collapse of his hardline regime, Zhivkov writes that his biggest mistake was failing to resist former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika reforms opening the country to the West and prevent Bulgaria's "withdrawal from the socialist path".</p>
<p>"I opposed consistently the Gorbachev theory and its Bulgarian admirers who introduced the same chaos to Bulgaria in order to keep their posts and benefits," Zhivkov says.</p>
<p>Booksellers said they expected the book to do well.</p>
<p>"I expect that people over 70 would be interested in the book because they still have affection for their communist leader and young people would buy it just out of curiosity," said Kalina Koleva, a stallholder at Sofia's open-air book market.</p>
<p>"It is outrageous that a man who should be in jail is publishing memoirs," said 53-year-old history teacher Dragomir Tihov. "The court cases against Zhivkov were a mere circus, and so is this book."</p>
<p>Zhivkov was convicted in 1992 of embezzling 21.5 million levs (then about $24 million) of public funds, spent on luxury apartments and Western cars for his family and favoured aides.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court overturned the sentence in January, but he remains under house arrest on separate charges for his assimilation policy against ethnic Turks in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Zhivkov was born in 1911 in the Balkan mountain village of Pravets outside Sofia. After an elementary education he worked in a Sofia printing firm.</p>
<p>Following a spell in the Communist Youth League, he joined the Communist Party in 1932, and organised partisan groups in the Sofia area during the German occupation in World War Two.</p>
<p>After the Communist takeover on September 9, 1944, he rose to become a full member of the ruling party politburo with a power base in Sofia. In 1971, with virtually all his rivals neutralised, he moved from premier to become head of state as well as party chief.</p>
<p>Today, the main opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party avoids comment on Zhivkov's political legacy and the tiny Communist Party dismisses him as a betrayal of the true communist ideal.</p>
<p>But as the country battles severe economic crisis, many Bulgarians feel nostalgic for the simpler days of one-party rule when bread was cheap and jobs were secure at the expense of personal freedom.</p>
<p>Bulgarian newspapers generally treat him as something of an eccentric old grandfather and their photographs usually show him smiling.</p>
<p>Zhivkov has adapted to the principles of the market economy sufficiently to demand high fees for interviews with foreign journalists. The book sells at 9,000 levs ($5.30).</p>
<p>Many Bulgarians are not so sympathetic to the former dictator, who describes himself as a common man but lives in his granddaughter's villa in Sofia's wealthy Boyana suburb.</p>
<p>"I have already read this book, and I read it through and through -- I am 44 years old, 33 of them I have lived under Zhivkov's rule...and I don't want to recall that time any more," the unemployed Mitko Ivanov said.</p>
