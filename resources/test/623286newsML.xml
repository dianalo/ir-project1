<p>Russian aircraft maker Yakovlev said on Thursday that it had begun building 10 Yak-130 jet trainers for Russia's defence ministry.</p>
<p>The vice-president of Aviatsionnaya Korporatsiya Yakovlev, Arkady Gurtovoi, told Reuters the planes were being produced at its Sokol aviation plant in Nizhny Novgorod in central Russia.</p>
<p>Yakovlev spokesman Yuri Zasypkin, who declined to give any details of the deal, said the defence ministry had ordered the jets but there was as yet no deal on financing: "We hope the defence ministry will finance the assembly of the planes."</p>
<p>The ministry, which has also ordered 10 jets from Yakovlev's main competitor the Mikoyan Design Bureau, has given no exact figure for a much larger order it is expected to make but industry sources say it could be around 200.</p>
<p>Russian aviation experts say a Yak-130 is priced at about $8 million for internal use.</p>
<p>Zasypkin said the two-seater trainers would be powered by Russian-Slovak engines and have Russian avionics.</p>
<p>Yakovlev, one of the Soviet Union's foremost designers of military aircraft, is competing for a further order with Mikoyan, which has designed MiG fighter aircraft ranging from the MiG-1 in World War Two to the latest MiG-31 jetfighter.</p>
<p>Mikoyan and French aircraft designers have teamed up to offer a two-seater MiG-AT (Advanced Training) aircraft, powered by two Larzac engines made by France's Snecma and Turbomeca companies.</p>
<p>Sextant Avionique, a unit of Thomson-CSF, will supply the avionics. Russian newspapers say the aircraft is priced at about $10 million.</p>
<p>The jet can simulate complex combat missions, preparing pilots for Russian, French and U.S.-built jet fighters.</p>
