<p>Poland has announced a day of mourning over week-long floods that have killed at least 33 people, caused incalculable damage to the country's south and are still spreading along the swollen Odra river.</p>
<p>While waters slowly receded and evacuees returned to devastated homes in dozens of towns and hundreds of villages in southern Poland, surges of flood water swept north up two major rivers to bring the horror to other communities.</p>
<p>"The government has decided to declare next Friday a day of national mourning," Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz told reporters late on Sunday after the cabinet met to decide how to coordinate rescue efforts and find funds to remedy the damage.</p>
<p>He said parliament would return from recess for a special sitting on Wednesday to pass needed amendments to 25 laws including this year's budget -- among other things to allow higher borrowing at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Cimoszewicz said the full costs of the disaster might never be known.</p>
<p>"It is impossible to rationally estimate the scale...losses are so vast no officials can make such estimates," he said.</p>
<p>The prime minister said he would appoint a special official with full powers to draft and implement reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the front line of Poland's battle against the deluge was Wroclaw, a historic city of 650,000 people which was part of Germany and known as Breslau before 1945.</p>
<p>The high-point in a northward surge along the Odra hit Wroclaw, swamping suburbs and most of the centre.</p>
<p>People stranded in high-rise buildings signalled to helicopters clattering overhead to call for food and to be rescued.</p>
<p>Thousands of volunteers battled for hours building sandbag barricades to defend the historic old town square and an island with famous buildings and a university library containing priceless books. Local officials said they seemed to have won.</p>
<p>But even as the flooding slowly subsided, waters continued to spread in the city, prompting a new fight to save the zoo.</p>
<p>The high-water level closed on towns further north towards the German border, including Glogow and Brzeg Dolny. Some 8,000 residents in the Legnica area were evacuated.</p>
<p>Deputy Environment Minister Krzysztof Szamalek told reporters it might still cause some floods, but added: "It won't be a cataclysm."</p>
<p>A less dangerous swell of high water was also advancing along the Wisla river and was due to reach Warsaw early on Monday, but Szamalek said it would not flood the capital.</p>
<p>Szamalek said 2,400 sq km were under water, down from 3,600 sq km at the peak of the floods.</p>
<p>The deluge, the region's worst natural disaster in centuries, also devastated swathes of the neighbouring Czech Republic during the week. It followed days of heavy rain.</p>
<p>Where the flooding receded, dozens of towns and hundreds of villages were left strewn with sewage, rubbish and dead cows.</p>
<p>Health officials broadcast warnings to hundreds of thousands of returning evacuees and survivors to clean everything, sterilise water and beware of contaminated food.</p>
<p>Poles elsewhere took gifts of soap, clothes, bread and blankets to collection points for transport south, but there were also reports on Polish radio of looting and profiteering.</p>
<p>Cimoszewicz and President Aleksander Kwasniewski were due to visit Bonn on Monday for the first session of planned regular German-Polish consultations and the prime minister said Poland needed further help from abroad, notably pumps.</p>
<p>Germany has rallied to help, supplying money, equipment and expertise. Foreign aid has also come from other sources.</p>
