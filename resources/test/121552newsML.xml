<p>Even though a prolonged rally has seen the Stockholm bourse increase in value by 25 percent since the turn of the year, analysts said on Wednesday investors could expect rich pickings next year, too.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of capital flowing into the bourse, and with interest rates this low there aren't any really good alternative investments at the moment," Hakan Telander, technical analyst at Sweden's Handelsbanken, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The performance of major Stockholm stock indices has easily outstripped most analysts' expectations over the year, with the OMX index of heavily-traded shares rising almost 25 percent since the last day of 1995 trading.</p>
<p>What no-one reckoned on was just how far Swedish debt yields would fall over the period.</p>
<p>The nine-year bond yield, now at 7.18 percent, started the year at 8.42 percent, and the six-month T-bill rate has slumped to 4.52 percent from 8.26 percent during the same period.</p>
<p>Apart from making bonds a far less attractive investment in themselves, lower market rates reduce the return requirement on share investments and increases their appeal in relation to interest-bearing securities.</p>
<p>Not only that, growing pension funds looking to place capital and a generally more stable economic environment in Sweden made the country a good choice for international investors, analysts said.</p>
<p>Kjetil Anthonisen, finance consultant at Sweden's Delphi Economics, said that although share prices were likely to recoil from current highs in the short term, investors should hang on to their hats next year.</p>
<p>"We expect a slight correction, the bourse is likely to fall by between five and ten percent over the coming few weeks, but it will be back where it is today by the end of the year," Anthonisen told Reuters.</p>
<p>Delphi Economics expects that a turnaround in the economy, persisting low interest rates and a recovery in corporate earnings will mean share price increases of around 20 percent in 1997, with a strong focus on growth companies.</p>
<p>Car safety equipment maker Autoliv and information technology group WM Data, both of which have shown remarkable growth in recent years, are two stocks to watch, Anthonisen said.</p>
<p>Handelsbanken's Telander agreed, saying that the OMX index, now at 1,684, could encounter difficulties passing through technical resistance at 1,700, but after that the way would be clear.</p>
<p>"The bourse is not overvalued at current interest rates. We expect to see the general index at 2,450 by the end of next year," he said -- implying a rise of 14 percent from current levels.</p>
<p>(Corrects to clarify that the analyst used the general index in his 1997 projection).</p>
<p>But if interest rates were the main cause of the upturn, they also represented the greatest risk.</p>
<p>"The worst case scenario is that the U.S. economy overheats and the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. The knock-on effects for us could be disastrous," one analyst said.</p>
