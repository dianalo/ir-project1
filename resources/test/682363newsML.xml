<p>The Lithuanian government said on Tuesday that it will submit the investment offers of Carlsberg and Baltic Beverage Holdings (BBH) to the shareholders of Utenos Beverages for their consideration in July.</p>
<p>"The agricultural ministry is supposed to present the offers of competing Carsberg and BBH to the shareholders' meeting of Utenos," Eurominister Laima Andrikiene told a news conference.</p>
<p>The general meeting of shareholders is scheduled for July 27.</p>
<p>BBH is owned by Hartwall and Orkla and has a major stake in Utenos's rival Kalnapilis.</p>
<p>Carsberg admitted earlier it has had contacts with Utenos Beverages, though it declined any further comment.</p>
<p>BBH has also been courting Utenos, which is one of the country's leading producers of beer.</p>
<p>Utenos Beverages said it had a letter of intent with a potential investor but would not name the company.</p>
<p>Utenos also said that an investment of 60 million litas to 80 million litas into production and marketing was necessary if it was to regain its former 35 percent share in the country's lucrative beer market.</p>
<p>Utenos Beverages has been involved in a long-running legal dispute with the government over how big a stake the state owns in the company and has made several unsucessfull attempts to register its shares with the securities commission.</p>
<p>Utenos said the state owned 21.5 percent in the company, but the government sees its stake as exceeding 40 percent.</p>
<p>Andrikiene said that bureaucratic obstacles were hindering the investment process in Utenos.</p>
<p>"The government must solve the dispute over the ownership of shares," Andrikiene said.</p>
<p>Andrikiene said she had met Carlsberg representatives during her recent visit to Copenhagen.</p>
