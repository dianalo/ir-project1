<title>DENMARK: Nordic ministers seek joint response to biker war.</title>

<p>Cabinet ministers from Finland, Norway and Sweden will meet Danish Justice Minister Bjoern Westh here on Friday for talks to seek a joint response to a bloody biker war, a Danish ministry official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Danish justice ministry spokesman Henning Christensen said that the council-of-war was called at such short notice that an agenda had not yet been drafted.</p>
<p>"But I think (the ministers) will try and carry away something solid," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Swedish Justice Minister Laila Freivalds has said that she will come and her Norwegian counterpart Grete Faremo is also expected to attend.</p>
<p>Finnish officials said that their delegate had not yet been finalised and it could be Home Minister Jan-Erik Enestam instead of Justice Minister Kari Hakamies.</p>
<p>Westh suggested the meeting after Sunday's missile attack on bike gang Hell's Angels' central Copenhagen headquarters, in which two people were killed.</p>
<p>Police regard the rival Bandido gang, which has been battling the dominant Hell's Angels for the past three years, as the main suspect.</p>
<p>The shoulder-fired anti-tank rocket used in the attack was one of a batch stolen from army stores in neighbouring Sweden in 1994. Other missiles from the break-in were fired at two Hell's Angels' clubhouses in different areas of Denmark last April.</p>
<p>The association of Danish local authorities says there are now about 40 biker strongholds spread across the country.</p>
<p>A Danish bill aimed at shutting down attack-prone gang buildings in residential neighbourhoods is now likely to become law next week, rather than by the coming weekend as Westh had orginally hoped, justice ministry officials said.</p>
<p>Amendments requested by parliamentarians after its committee hearing on Monday are being inserted and the bill is expected to receive its second and third readings on Thursday.</p>
<p>Another three working days must then pass before Queen Margrethe can sign it into law.</p>
<p>Sweden and Norway have both said that they will study details of the new Danish law -- the first in a promised package to give police wider gang-busting powers -- to see if it might be suitable for them.</p>
<p>Of the five Nordic countries, only sparsely-populated Iceland has so far escaped the biker war, believed to have claimed seven lives so far although at least one of the dead may have been killed by internal rivals.</p>
<p>"We have not seen this problem here yet, but we are watching what is going on elsewhere," an Icelandic police officer told Reuters in Copenagen by telephone.</p>
<p>Conflict between the gangs, both local offshoots of U.S. groups with extensive European networks, began almost as soon as the Bandidos set up shop in the region in the summer of 1993.</p>
<p>In February 1994 a member of the Hell's Angels-affiliated Rednecks died in a gunfight after walking -- reportedly by accident -- into a Bandidos meeting at a night club in the Swedish port of Helsingborg.</p>
<p>The then newly elected president of the Bandidos, Mikael Ljunggren, was killed by a sniper as he rode his motorcycle north of the city in July 1995, in an ambush that investigators said could have been either a Hells Angels attack or the work of fellow gang members opposed to his leadership.</p>
<p>In March this year, attackers shot dead a Bandidos leader in the Finnish capital, Helsinki, and a Danish Bandido died in an ambush outside Copenhagen airport 10 days later.</p>
<p>A Danish Bandidos member was fatally shot in the head near the Norwegian city of Drammen in July.</p>
