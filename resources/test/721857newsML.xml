<p>Zimbabwe's key industrial index closed firmer on Friday reflecting continued investor appetite for equities in the face of stagnant rates on the local money market, brokers said.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of liquidity around. People have money (to invest) and rates on the money market haven't gone anywhere of late," one broker commented.</p>
<p>The key index put on 31.95 points on Friday to close at 10,929.92, gaining 104.9 points on the week.</p>
<p>The day's advances were in cement firm Porthold which surged 100 cents to 2,100 while financial group Finhold climbed 50 cents to 850 and seed producer Seedco put on 25 cents to 450. Horticultural investors Ariston were up 15 cents to 225.</p>
<p>Minings contined lifeless with gold companies Falgold and Rio Tinto and coal miners Wankie trading at previous levels. The seven share mining index was unchanged at Thursday's 870.77 but inched up 3.58 points during the week.</p>
