<p>The White House said on Monday there has been little progress on China's bid to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO) but would not rule out the possibility an accord might be reached by the end of the year.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry was prompted to comment on the matter by a New York Times report on Monday that quoted unnamed U.S. officials as saying that it was unlikely a broad agreement will be reached this year to admit China to the WTO.</p>
<p>Speaking at his daily briefing, McCurry denied the White House had concluded China would not be ready for membership in time for Chinese President Jiang Zemin's planned meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington this October.</p>
<p>He also said the administration would continue talks with China on the matter and said Beijing was expected to make a new proposal in September.</p>
<p>"We are determined to continue our good faith negotiations with the Chinese to achieve commercially viable terms that would allow China to comply with international norms accepted by all WTO members and provide for improved market access by U.S. companies to Chinese markets," McCurry said.</p>
<p>"The assessment of the status of those negotiations are quite clear from some of the things Ambassador Barshefsky has said," he added. "But at the same time, by no means do we rule out continuing our dialogue."</p>
<p>U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, the chief U.S. trade negotiator, was quoted by the New York Times as describing the Chinese negotiating offers as being "tepid."</p>
<p>"If China wishes its hopes to enter the WTO to be a key element of the meeting with President Clinton, it must move quite rapidly now," Barshefsky told the newspaper. "But there is no indication at this juncture that China intends to move meaningfully forward."</p>
<p>If the New York Times report appeared a calculated effort by U.S. negotiators to pressure China on the issue, McCurry's remarks seemed designed to avoid ruffling Chinese feathers.</p>
<p>Asked if he expected China to make enough progress on the issue by Jiang's October visit, McCurry replied: "We believe they are scheduled to make another proposal or another presentation in September."</p>
<p>The New York Times report said that U.S. officials had once hoped that an agreement on admitting China to the WTO would be the centrepiece of Jiang's U.S. visit.</p>
<p>The United States and China last year agreed for Clinton and Jiang to make reciprocal visits after a lengthy period of strained relations. Sino-U.S. relations were frayed by a number of issues, including Taiwan, trade and human rights.</p>
