<p>DMG Radio Australia, a unit of Britain's Daily Mail and General Trust Plc, has bought Adelaide radio station 5AA for A$7.5 million, subject to final adjustments, the South Australian government said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>State Racing Minister Graham Ingerson said in a statement the sale price to DMG Radio Australia, a subsdiary of the Daily Mail's DMG Radio, was well above market expectations.</p>
<p>The AM station 5AA has been owned since 1984 by the state-run South Australian Totalisator Agency Board (TAB), which also ran the narrow-cast radio licence TABRadio for broadcasting horse racing information.  </p>
<p>As part of the sale process, 5AA had been contracted to manage TABRadio for five years in a commercial contract which was favourable to the TAB, Ingerson said.</p>
<p>The TAB would continue to hold the TABRadio licence, he said.</p>
<p>DMG Radio Australia announced on Tuesday it had agreed to buy Broadcast Media, a privately-held company owning 12 regional radio stations in Australia.</p>
<p>Its British parent announced on later on Tuesday it had paid A$46 million or 23.4 million stg for an 85 percent economic and a 100 percent voting interest in Broadcast Media.  </p>
<p>DMG Radio Australia was set up in February to expand DMG Radio's interests in Australia.</p>
<p>Thompson said DMG Radio aimed to use Broadcast Media as a base for expansion both regionally and within the various state capital radio markets, both by buying existing stations and buying licenses for fresh stations.</p>
