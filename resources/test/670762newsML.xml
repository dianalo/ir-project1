<p>Algerian President Liamine Zeroual on Wednesday invited party leaders for talks to set a date for local elections he has promised for this year, Algerian state-run radio reported, quoting a presidential statement.</p>
<p>Zeroual will also discuss arrangements for the poll, the radio said, without giving a date for his meeting with party leaders.</p>
<p>Elected local authorities will pick two-thirds of the 144 members for the Council of the Nation (Upper House of Parliament). The remaining third will be appointed by Zeroual from among leading figures in business, public service and intellectual groups.</p>
<p>The new upper house and the 380-member National Assembly, elected earlier this month, form Algeria's parliament. The head of the Council of the Nation temporarily replaces the president in case of impeachment, death or incapacity.</p>
<p>Algeria has been without elected authorities in most of its 48 main cities and some 1,500 towns and local communities since 1993 when the authorities dismissed elected radical Islamists saying they had turned local government into a "spider's web" for guerrillas.</p>
<p>The radical Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) swept to local government power in June 1990, winning control in most main cities and town councils.</p>
<p>The FIS was banned in 1992 shortly after the authorities scrapped a general election in which the Islamist group had taken a commanding lead.</p>
<p>Algeria elected its first pluralist National Assembly (lower house) on June 5 in which moderate Islamists, secularists, left-wing activists and pro-government political forces are represented.</p>
