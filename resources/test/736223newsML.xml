<headline>US Spot Products--Gulf gasoline diffs dip slightly.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-17</dateline>

<p>U.S. Gulf conventional gasoline shrugged off an early attempt by sellers to boost differnentials and moved lower near midday, while New York Harbor premium grades remained scarce and expensive.</p>
<p>In the Midcontinent, market players cited ample supply as the main factor in the differential drop seen over the past two days.</p>
<p>NYMEX August gasoline jumped 1.09 cent to 61.55 cents a gallon and August heating oil firmed 0.77 cent to sit at 53.45 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>U.S. GULF</p>
<p>Prompt regular conventional M1 gasoline differentials moved sharply in early action, with offers sliding back to below 1.00 cents under the August NYMEX level, down about 0.10 cent from late Wednesday levels.</p>
<p>Sellers initially lifted their offers to 0.25 cent under the NYMEX, attempting to take advantage of the scheduling deadline on front 21st cycle barrels on the Colonial Pipeline, the main artery from the Gulf to the East Coast.</p>
<p>But buyers refused to budge, and sellers were forced to sharply drop their offer prices for the conventional M1 gasoline, according to market players.</p>
<p>Prompt premium conventional V1 gasoline held onto its recent strength, sitting between about 5.75 and 6.00 cents over the prompt M1 gasoline differential.</p>
<p>Distillate differentials were little changed in early Thursday action, traders said.</p>
<p>NEW YORK HARBOR</p>
<p>Differentials for premium reformulated D2 gasoline in New York Harbor continued their climb, lifted largely by tight supply of the gasoline additive MTBE.</p>
<p>Players pegged offers of the premium D2-grade at 12.00 cents over the NYMEX, about a half cent above Wednesday, which had a more than 3.00 cent rise. A parcel for 11.75 cent sold late yesterday as well as a 11.25 cent parcel this morning.</p>
<p>"D2 is still strong and we've got sellers now asking for 12.00 cents," said one Harbor trader, reciting rumors that a South American producer has called a force majeure on a cargo of MTBE.</p>
<p>A producer source denied the rumor and said the 12,500 bpd SuperOctanos plant in Venezuela, which has been on prolonged turnaround because of technical problems, will try to restart Friday.</p>
<p>Prompt barrels of MTBE are almost nonexistent in New York Harbor and the U.S. Gulf Coast because of a recent spate of production glitches and blending demand.</p>
<p>Prompt regular 87-octane reformulated gasoline differentials also rose about a 0.50 cent to 2.00/2.50 cents over the August futures. An any-month parcel sold for 1.75 cents over the NYMEX, with sellers now at 2.00 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>MIDCONTINENT</p>
<p>Cash products in the Midcontinent continued their fall in the wake of Wednesday's collapse, pressured by ample supply, too many sellers and weakening differentials in the U.S. Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>Group Three unleaded gasoline differentials were down a quarter cent to 0.50 to 0.75 cent over NYMEX August futures, about 1.50 cents below levels on Tuesday. Players said they were expecting more shipments of gasoline into the hub, putting inventories at a hefty 6.1 million barrels.</p>
<p>Chicago prompt gasoline differentials also weakened to about 0.25 to 0.50 cents over the print. Any-month barrels were about on par.</p>
<p>Group Three prompt low sulphur was at 2.00 to 2.25 over teh NYMEX and Chicago material was pegged at 0.25 under the print.</p>
