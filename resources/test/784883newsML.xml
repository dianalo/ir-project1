<p>Eight people who miraculously survived the fiery crash of a Korean Air Lines jumbo jet on Guam were airlifted to Seoul on Friday, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The eight were lowered on stretchers from a U.S. medical evacuation plane to eight ambulances which sped them to hospital for treatment of injuries they suffered when Flight 801 slammed into a hillside on the Pacific island on Wednesday.</p>
<p>U.S. military medical personnel accompanied seven South Koreans and a Korean-born American who were in good enough state to travel to Seoul, airport officials said.</p>
<p>The military evacuation plane, C-9 Nightingale, is due to fly back to Guam to ferry 11 more South Korean survivors home, Seoul officials said. Most survivors suffered burns from a fire that broke out after the crash, KAL officials said.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said only 27 of 254 people aboard survived the crash. Five other people were alive when they were pulled from the smouldering wreckage, but died later in hospital.</p>
<p>Rescuers have given up hope of finding any more survivors amid the wreckage.</p>
<p>"I felt like I was dying in each second of waiting amid conflicting news reports that my son died or survived," said the mother of Lee Yong-ho, one of the airlifed survivor, as she waited in a Seoul hospital for his son.</p>
<p>"I felt as if my blood was drying up," she said.</p>
<p>U.S. safety investigators who searched through wreckage of the KAL jumbo jetliner said on Thursday it was too early to determine what caused the crash.</p>
<p>"It is really too early to speculate the cause of this accident," George Black, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and chairman of the committee investigating the crash, said.</p>
<p>The flight data and voice recorders arrived in Washington on Wednesday night and work on deciphering the information began immediately, according to a spokesman for the NTSB.</p>
