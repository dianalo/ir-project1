<p>China's domestic spot copper prices are expected to fluctuate between 22,000 yuan ($2,650) and 26,000 yuan per tonne in the second half of 1997, the People's Daily Overseas Edition said on Monday.</p>
<p>Copper prices were expected to have upward potential in the second half because of rising consumption, it quoted a forecast by the China National Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corp as saying.</p>
<p>On the Shanghai Metal Exchange, the October 1997 contract ended at 21,590 yuan ($2,604) per tonne on Monday, up 200 yuan from Friday's close.</p>
<p>An official crackdown on speculation in the stock market would also drive some funds into copper-related production and trading sectors and push up consumption, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>China's copper firms were expected to boost exports to the international market to cash in on higher overseas prices, thus reducing supply in domestic markets, it said.</p>
<p>"Domestic demand is still weak," an official of the China National Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corp said. "Exports remain a profitable business."</p>
