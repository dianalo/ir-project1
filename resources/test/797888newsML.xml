<p>The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment rose 0.2 of a point or 0.2 percent in August to 101.3.</p>
<p>Bill Evans, Westpac's General Manager, Economics, said the result is a very disappointing response for consumer sentiment to the 0.5 percent reduction in official interest rates and mortgage rates which occurred about a week before the survey.</p>
<p>"In the survey, there was some improvement in consumers' views on the economic outlook, but surprisingly, a fall in their opinions on the state of the family finances both compared with last year and over the next 12 months," Evans said.  </p>
<p>Evans said long term trends indicate that concerns with unemployment and the economy are the key factors holding back consumer confidence.</p>
<p>"With this relationship in place, we will be relying on a clear improvement in the labour market to spur a sustainable lift in consumer confidence, which will eventually feed through to high consumer spending," he said.</p>
<p>Evans noted that consumer sentiment has fallen by 7.8 percent since January, while by August 1993 sentiment that year had fallen 5.0 percent. In both years there were two official rate cuts totalling 1.0 percent by end July, reaching 4.75 percent in 1993 and 5.0 percent in 1997, but mortgage rates are much lower in 1997.</p>
<p>Evans said there is evidence from the housing market and the Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index that a recovery in the labour market is probably on the way and a lift in consumer sentiment will follow.</p>
<p>"A further reduction in official interest rates will certainly assist this recovery without threatening inflation," Evans said.  </p>
<p>"Consequently, Westpac believes that the Reserve Bank will move to reduce interest rates one more time sometime over the next few months, even though there may be some early signs of a stronger economy," he added.</p>
