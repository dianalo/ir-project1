<p>Heavy rains and floods in Romania in recent days have destroyed 16 percent of the area put under wheat and rye, the private Pro TV television station said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Quoting the Agriculture Ministry, the station said 32 percent of the 2.38 million hectares put under wheat and rye had been affected by the adverse weather. Half of that area had been destroyed, it said.  </p>
<p>Pro TV said the worst hit areas had been the counties of Galati and Bacau, in the eastern region of Moldova, where the wheat crop on some 43,000 ha had been destroyed. Damage was also widespread in the southern counties of Olt, Teleorman, Giurgiu and Tulcea, with some 14,000 ha under water.</p>
<p>In the western region of Bihor, bad weather destroyed grain crops on 19,000 hectares, it said.</p>
<p>Ministry officials were unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>Initial ministry estimates put Romania's 1997 wheat crop at some seven million tonnes and exports at over two million and have insisted that adverse weather in recent weeks had not affected crops.</p>
<p>But experts in recent days have questioned the government figures and predicted a substantially lower harvest.</p>
