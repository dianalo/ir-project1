<p>Philippine President Fidel Ramos on Tuesday reiterated that he would abide by the constitution and step down next year.</p>
<p>Ramos, on the third day of a four-day official visit to India, also told Reuters in an interview that the family of former president Ferdinand Marcos could bury his corpse in Manila, but not in the Heroes Cemetery where soldiers lie.</p>
<p>Asked if he would relinquish power in mid-1998 when elections are scheduled to be held and not press for a second term, Ramos said: "I'm saying that as president I will follow what is in the constitution that applies.</p>
<p>"I'm committed to that. I will stick to that."</p>
<p>Ramos said the issue of whether to scrap a constitutional provision limiting Philippine presidents to single, six-year term was only one of many issues up for review.</p>
<p>"You must understand that the term limits are not the only issues. To me, they are non-issues," he said.</p>
<p>Asked it he was ruling out the possibility of staying in power beyond next year, Ramos said: "I've said that many times already. I'll say it to you again."</p>
<p>Ramos has repeatedly said he does not intend to stand in next year's elections. But some of his political allies have suggested that the ruling party would not oppose a constitutional amendment permitting a second term.</p>
<p>On Monday, a Philippine power firm cut the electricity to the mausoleum where the Marcos's body lies in a glass coffin.</p>
<p>Workers of the Ilocos Norte Electric Cooperative pulled the plug on the family compound in the northern Philippine town of Batac, Marcos's home town, after the family failed to pay bills totalling 5.643 million pesos ($214,500), cooperative officials said.</p>
<p>Former first lady Imelda Marcos called the move "the ultimate harassment, the harassment of the dead who cannot speak up to defend himself".</p>
<p>But Ramos, who is Marcos's cousin, said the decision to cut off the supply of electricity was "purely a business decision" on the part of the cooperative.</p>
<p>The Philippine leader was asked if he would support a request by the Marcos family to have his corpse buried in the capital Manila.</p>
<p>"We have said it before that he can be buried anywhere except in those places where the president of the Philippines must give the authority for burial," he replied.</p>
<p>Marcos died in exile in Hawaii in 1989 but it was not until three years later when Ramos took over the presidency that the government allowed his remains to be brought into the country.</p>
<p>Marcos's successor, Corazon Aquino, had barred the cadaver from the country, fearing its presence might spark violence among the supporters of the former ruler.</p>
<p>"There are so many cemeteries in Manila that will take him. But we have one cemetery for the heroes which requires presidential approval," he said, referring to "Libingan ng mga Bayani", meaning "Heroes Cemetery" where Filipino soldiers are buried.</p>
<p>"We have not given that approval, but there are thousands of other places including private places where he can be buried."</p>
