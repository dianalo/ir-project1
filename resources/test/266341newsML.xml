<headline>NHL ICE HOCKEY-RICHTER GETS ANOTHER SHUTOUT AS RANGERS BLANK KINGS.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mike Richter turned aside 37 shots for his second shutout in five days and Luc Robitaille scored twice against his former club as the New York Rangers blanked the Los Angeles Kings 4-0 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Richter stopped 12 shots in the first period, 10 in the second and 15 in the third for his 16th career shutout as the surging Rangers improved to 9-1-1 in their last 11 games.</p>
<p>Wayne Gretzky, another former King, collected three assists to extend his points streak to 10 games and grab sole possession of the National Hockey League scoring lead.</p>
<p>Gretzky ran his assists total to a league-best 34 and has 48 points in 35 games.</p>
<p>The only goal not set up by Gretzky was scored by Mark Messier, whose unassisted short-handed goal at 3:16 of the second period made it 3-0.</p>
<p>With the Kings on a powerplay, Messier stole the puck from Neal Broten at centre ice, broke in alone on Kings goalie Byron Dafoe and snapped a backhander into the top of the net.</p>
<p>It was Messier's 555th career goal, putting him one shy of tying John Bucyk for 12th place on the all-time list.</p>
<p>"We're ready for all the games now," Robitaille said. "It seems we have gotten much more confidence as a team. We're rolling."</p>
<p>In Chicago, Mike Modano scored 27 seconds into overtime as the Dallas Stars rallied from a two-goal deficit for a 3-2 victory over the Blackhawks.</p>
<p>After a scoreless third period, Modano broke into the Chicago zone on a 2-on-1 with Greg Adams. He tried to feed the puck across to Adams, but it hit defenceman Chris Chelios in the skates and came back to Modano, who fired it into an open net for his sixth goal in seven games and fifth game-winner of the season.</p>
<p>Benoit Hogue and Pat Verbeek scored powerplay goals for the Stars after Bob Probert and Kevin Miller scored first-period goals for the Blackhawks, who have lost five of their last six at home.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, Denis Pederson's powerplay goal midway through the third period snapped a tie and the New Jersey Devils held the Canucks to a mere eight shots in a 2-1 win.</p>
<p>With Martin Gelinas serving a double minor penalty for high-sticking, Pederson grabbed a loose puck off a goalmouth scramble and lifted it over fallen goaltender Mike Fountain.</p>
<p>Fountain made 28 saves, while Devils goalie Martin Brodeur faced just four shots in the first period and two each in the second and third.</p>
<p>New Jersey's Steve Sullivan and Vancouver's Gino Odjick traded second-period goals.</p>
<p>In Buffalo, Derek Plante scored twice and Mike Wilson and Michal Grosek each had two assists as the Sabres held on for a 5-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning.</p>
<p>Dixon Ward, Jason Dawe and Matthew Barnaby also scored for the Sabres, who have won three of their last four games.</p>
<p>Dominik Hasek made 29 saves for the Sabres and has allowed just eight goals in his last four games. Hasek also recorded an assist on Barnaby's empty-net goal.</p>
<p>Roman Hamrlik, Drew Bannister and Dino Ciccarelli tallied for the Lightning.</p>
<p>In Edmonton, Valeri Kamensky's second goal of the game 8:10 into the third period lifted the Colorado Avalanche into a 4-4 tie with the Oilers.</p>
<p>Joe Sakic had three assists for Colorado, including setting up the tying goal when he tracked down his own rebound in the right corner and centred a pass into the slot for Kamensky, who deflected the puck past Curtis Joseph.</p>
<p>Andrei Kovalenko had two goals for Edmonton. His second of the game at 4:51 of the third had given the Oilers a 4-3 lead.</p>
<p>Ryan Smyth and Michel Petit had the other Edmonton goals. Adam Deadmarsh and Sandis Ozolinsh also scored for Colorado.</p>
<p>In Calgary, Todd Simpson's first NHL goal 8:25 into the third period lifted the Flames into a 3-3 tie with the Detroit Red Wings.</p>
<p>Vyacheslav Kozlov and Brendan Shanahan netted first-period powerplay goals for Detroit, which led 3-1 after Viacheslav Fetisov scored at 6:37 of the second.</p>
<p>Robert Reichel's powerplay tally for Calgary six minutes later pulled the Flames within one.</p>
<p>Trevor Kidd made 25 saves for the Flames, while Chris Osgood finished with 21 stops for the Red Wings.</p>
