<p>The chief executives of Kenyan and Malaysian capital markets signed a bilateral agreement on Monday aimed at improving the efficiency of the Nairobi bourse -- Africa's fifth largest.</p>
<p>The agreement was signed by the head of the Capital Markets Authority of Kenya (CMA), Paul Melly, and the chairman of the Securities Commission of Malaysia, Mohd Munir Abdul Majid.</p>
<p>Majid said increased globalisation of securities markets had created challenges for domestic enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>"Countries in the south must not only have the desire, but also the resolve and shall I say, the political will to share whatever knowledge and technical assistance that can be offered," Majid said.</p>
<p>His views were supported by Melly who added: "Kenya stands to benefit from drawing on the experience of Malaysia on various issues relating to capital markets development -- especially in nurturing the emergence of new market institutions and new products."</p>
<p>Melly added that the Rating Agency of Malaysia would also act as a role model for the establishment of a similar institution in Kenya.</p>
<p>The agreement will facilitate the exchange of information on how to establish the minimum standards required for an efficient market.</p>
<p>The agreement will also pave way for Malaysian technical assistance and training of Kenyans at the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Majid also said this was the first time Malaysia had signed such an understanding with an African securities regulator.</p>
<p>The Nairobi bourse has a market capitalisation of $2.28 billion and is ranked the fifth in Africa.</p>
