<p>Thai finance companies and brokerage associations on Saturday condemned a recent police raid against two foreign brokers, saying such actions would affect the country's image and foreign investors' confidence.</p>
<p>In a statement jointly issued by the Association of Finance Companies, the Association of Securities Companies and the Securities Analysts Association, it said the police raid would also frighten investment analysts from presenting their research and views.</p>
<p>"The three associations do not agree with such actions of the police. It will affect Thailand's image and foreign investors' confidence," the statement said.</p>
<p>Police on Thursday raided offices of ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett Asia and Capital Nomura Securities Plc to investigate if they were behind rumours that some medium and small Thai banks might be suspended by the authorities.</p>
<p>Government spokesmen last week said rumours about troubled Thai banks were spread by fax messages to other countries by some equities research houses that held malicious views on Thailand.</p>
<p>Both leading foreign brokerages denied the police charges.</p>
<p>The country is experiencing its worst economic slump in more than a decade with severe problems in its financial and property sectors.</p>
<p>On July 2, the authorities floated the baht, which led to a de facto devaluation of between 15 and 20 percent.</p>
<p>Bangkok Metropolitan Bank Plc, Siam City Bank Plc, First Bangkok City Bank Plc, Laem Thong Bank Plc, and Union Bank of Bangkok Plc, have denied they were potential targets of suspension by the government.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand also denied the rumours.</p>
<p>But the talk caused a slide in prices on the Thai stock market as investors steered clear of some banking stocks.</p>
<p>The associations said the impact from the raid on the stock market will be much worse than from the rumour itself.</p>
