<p>NYMEX electricity futures ended higher Tuesday in line with stronger natural gas futures but were capped by lower spot power prices and expectations of possibly significant hydroelectric availability, sources said.</p>
<p>January California Oregon Border (COB) power futures finished up 36 cents at $24.11 per megawatt hour (MWh) after morning trade as low as $23.40, while February COB ended up nine cents at $18.80 per MWh.</p>
<p>Remaining COB deferreds settled steady from Monday's closes.</p>
<p>January Palo Verde (PV) finished up 50 cents at $24.75 after trade as low as $23.75, while February closed down 77 cents at $19.38 after trade as low as $18.75 per MWh.</p>
<p>Remaining PV deferreds settled steady to $1.00 higher.</p>
<p>Although natural gas futures surged strongly higher, traders said electricity futures were capped by concern over the possibility of strong hydroelectric availability in the U.S. Northwest, the sources said.</p>
<p>In a move considered bearish for western electricity, Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) on Tuesday offered next-day surplus peak power for sale for the first time in almost two weeks.</p>
<p>"If BPA had not been in the market today we would have seen a bigger rally, (electricity futures) probably would have followed gas higher," said one futures trader.</p>
<p>January Henry Hub natural gas futures finished up 17.4 cents at $3.396 per million British thermal units on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Spot next day peak power in the U.S. Northwest fell Tuesday to $22.00-23.25 per MWh, while Southwest power held relatively steady at $22.00-23.00 per MWh.</p>
<p>NYMEX said an estimated total of 200 COB and 239 PV contracts traded Tuesday.</p>
