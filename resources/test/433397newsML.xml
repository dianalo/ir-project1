<p>Reports of violence against gay men and lesbians rose last year despite a marked drop in violent crime around the country, according to a study released Tuesday by two watchdog groups.</p>
<p>The report found a 6 percent increase in anti-gay violence, based on data collected by 14 community-based programmes. It was issued by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence and the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, in response to the report by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence, issued a statement from Washington deploring so-called hate crimes.</p>
<p>"Recent reports, including data from the FBI, have shown a disturbing rise in the number of hate crimes based on race, colour, national origin, religion and secxual orientation," she said, calling on Congress to bolster the ability of the government to deal with such crimes.</p>
<p>Reno said federal statutes do not permit prosecution of crimes motivated by a victim's sexual orientation but, under the 1994 Crime Act, anyone who otherwise violates federal law can be sentenced to a longer prison term if they commit the crime because of a victim's sexual orientation.</p>
<p>The report documented a total of 2,529 anti-gay incidents last year. A vast majority -- 95 percent -- were aimed at individuals and the rest were crimes against property such as graffiti and vandalism, the report said.</p>
<p>The number of victims injured rose to 867 from 775 the previous year, but the number of murders dropped to 21 from 29 the year before, it said.</p>
<p>A total of 294 incidents were motivated solely by bias against people with HIV and AIDS, the report said.</p>
<p>Most incidents occurred near victims' homes, on the street or in a public area, and just one in ten occured at or near a gay bar or event, it said. In what appeared to be a pattern that anti-gay violence increases when the community is most visible, the report said, the highest number of bias attacks occurred in June, which was Lesbian and Gay Pride Month.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the offenders were under 30 years old, and 85 percent were male, it said.</p>
<p>The most commonly used weapons were thrown objects such as bricks or bottles and hand-held objects such as bats or clubs.</p>
<p>Anti-gay violence rose in Chicago, Cleveland and Los Angeles but dropped in New York City, Phoenix and St. Louis, the report said.</p>
<p>In several metropolitan areas, an increase in anti-gay violence contrasted with drops in overall violent crime of as much as 20 percent or more, it said.</p>
<p>In the most significant drop in reports of anti-gay violence ever documented by the groups in a single year, the report found 575 anti-gay incidents in New York City, down 8 percent from 1995. That was still less of a drop than the overall decrease in violent crime of more that 15 percent reported by the New York City Police Department, it said.</p>
