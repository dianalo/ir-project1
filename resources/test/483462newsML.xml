<p>The key June 10-year Japanese government bond futures rose to an all-time high of 126.89 in afternoon trade on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The JGBs' surge in the afternoon was due to a local media report which said the Finance Ministry's Trust Fund Bureau is now able to hold JGBs for more than five years, a traders said.</p>
<p>Investors, primarily life insurers, purchased long-term cash JGBs on the news, and this pushed up JGB futures, a brokerage house trader said. JGB futures later came off the high on profit-taking sales, the trader added.</p>
<p>The June rose as high as 126.92 at 0539 GMT, compared with the previous day's close of 125.95.</p>
