<p>Vietnam exported 231,000 tonnes of coffee during its 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) season, a rise of 9.8 percent from the previous year, the official Nhan Dan daily reported on Monday.</p>
<p>The Communist Party daily said earnings from coffee exports were $420 million, a drop of 25 percent from 1994/95, largely because of a fall in world prices for the commodity.</p>
<p>It said Vietnam's targets for 1997 were to have 220,000 hectares (543,600 acres) under coffee cultivation -- compared with around 200,000 hectares (494,000 acres) currently -- and an output of at least 240,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Hoang Thanh Tiem, vice-director of the national Coffee Research Institute, told Reuters last month that he expected the 1996/97 harvest to yield 270,000 tonnes, a jump of more than 17 percent from last year's crop.</p>
