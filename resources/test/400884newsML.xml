<p>Former Guatemalan foreign minister Guillermo Torriello, a crusader for leftist causes in Latin America, was buried in Havana on Tuesday after a ceremony attended by senior Cuban officials.</p>
<p>Torriello, who had lived in Cuba since 1981, died in Havana on Monday aged 85.</p>
<p>Jose Ramon Balaguer, a member of Cuba's Communist Party Politburo, called Torriello one of the dearest friends of Cuba's revolution and an "implacable enemy of neoliberalism and racism."</p>
<p>Balaguer recalled Toriello's fight against dictatorships in his country and his work campaigning against what he called U.S. imperialism in Latin America.</p>
<p>Torriello was foreign minister in the government of Juan Jose Arevalo in 1945, and again in 1954 in Jacobo Arbenz's government. After Arbenz was overthrown, he went in exile in Mexico and Europe. In 1979 he joined the Nicaragua's Marxist Sandinista movement in the final stages of its struggle to overthrow dictator Anastasio Somoza.</p>
<p>Among senior Cuban officials present at the funeral at the Armed Forces pantheon were Defence Minister Raul Castro, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly.</p>
