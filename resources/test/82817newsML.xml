<p>Japan on Friday stayed non-committal to China's requests to deal with the Japanese rightists who built a lighthouse on one of the disputed islands in the East China Sea.</p>
<p>But Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said China and Japan agreed that the territorial dispute must be dealt with prudently and not affect overall bilateral ties.</p>
<p>"China and Japan discussed (in New York) that Japan will carefully deal with the acts of the private group based on the common understanding that this issue must not jeopardise overall relations between the two countries," Ikeda told a news conference.</p>
<p>A chartered vessel from Hong Kong entered waters near the islands to protest Japan's claim to the territory. Their leader David Chan drowned on Thursday after jumping into the sea in protest.</p>
<p>The activists had vowed to reclaim the islands, saying they would remove the lighthouse built by Japanese rightists in July and raise the red flag of the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>Ikeda refused to comment whether he had promised Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during their talks in New York on the sidelines of a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly that Japan would deal with the right-wingers.</p>
<p>He repeated that both China and Japan had agreed to deal with the matter calmly.</p>
<p>"There is no knowing if such media reports (about a Japanese promise) are true or whether a misunderstanding between China and Japan really exists," Ikeda said.</p>
<p>In New York, Qian asked Ikeda to have Japan take "concrete action" but Ikeda was noncommittal in his reply, urging China in turn to approach the situation reasonably and not let the issue interfere with bilateral relations.</p>
<p>"The two nations take different positions on this issue, but we both understood that this issue must not affect the general relationship between the two countries," Ikeda repeated.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese protests started escalating in July when Japanese right-wingers built a makeshift lighthouse on one of the disputed islands, called Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese.</p>
