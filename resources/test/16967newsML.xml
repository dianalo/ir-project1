<p>Mother Teresa's health improved significantly on Tuesday, her 86th birthday, and doctors said they were increasingly confident the legendary missionary would survive her battle against malaria and heart trouble.</p>
<p>"Mother Teresa continues to show slow and steady improvement," Dr S.K. Sen, medical director of Calcutta's Woodlands Nursing Home, told reporters.</p>
<p>Sen, who is part of a six-member team of doctors treating the Nobel Peace Prize winner, said Mother Teresa had been taken off respiratory support for 14 hours on Tuesday -- a key step on the road to recovery.</p>
<p>"She is fully conscious and alert and there is no further need to reconnect the respirator during the day," he said.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic nun was taken to hospital on August 20 with high fever and severe vomiting. Later she suffered heart failure and was diagnosed with malaria.</p>
<p>Her fever has since abated and her heart beat, while irregular, has been brought under control. But doctors have been keen to wean Mother Teresa from the respirator to speed her recovery.</p>
<p>Over the past several days, Mother Teresa had breathed intermittently without the respirator but on Tuesday she was able to breathe entirely on her own for the first time, doctors said.</p>
<p>"We cannot say she is totally out of danger, but we are feeling much more optimistic," Sen had said earlier on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sen said that when he asked her in the morning how she was feeling, Mother Teresa scribbled on a piece of paper: "I have got a pacemaker."</p>
<p>Mother Teresa, who has been unable to speak because of the respiratory tube, was fitted with the heart-regulating device in 1989.</p>
<p>The nun's birthday prompted greetings, bouquets and prayers from around the world.</p>
<p>Pope John Paul II and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy sent her get-well messages, the Press Trust of India said.</p>
<p>"Ask for a miracle. Happy Birthday to our Dearest Mother," read a placard at the Shishu Bhavan children's home in central Calcutta run by Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity.</p>
<p>On Monday, both houses of India's parliament wished the nation's adopted sister a happy birthday and speedy recovery from her illness.</p>
<p>Prayers continued in Calcutta, one of the world's poorest cities, where Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity runs several homes for the poor and destitute.</p>
<p>Street children, some of them born to prostitutes, held prayers on the street. "All of us know about her. She is like a goddess," said Raju, 8.</p>
<p>Tarak Das, 70, was picked up from a Calcutta footpath a week ago by passers-by who took pity on him and brought him to Nirmal Hriday (Immaculate Home).</p>
<p>"I do not know who she is. I have never seen her, but I can only bless her for what she has done for people like me," Das told The Statesman newspaper.</p>
