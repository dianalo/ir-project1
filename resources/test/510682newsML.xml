<p>Transcend Services Inc said Monday its lawsuit against 13 workers' compensation insurance carrier groups in California has been dismissed by the Los Angeles Superior Court.</p>
<p>The company said it will appeal the ruling to the California Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>By stipulation, Transcend said, the carriers' cross-complaints against the plaintiffs were stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs' appeal.</p>
<p>Transcend said it believes the trial court's ruling, if upheld by the appellate court, also would result in dismissal of the cross-complaints.</p>
<p>Transcend is a hospital services company that provides a range of services including case management services to insurance carriers, third party administrators and self-insured employers.</p>
