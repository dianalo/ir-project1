<p>Twenty banks controlling the lion's share of global foreign exchange transactions plan to set up a clearing bank before the end of the decade in a bid to eliminate settlement risks, Deutsche Bank said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The so-called "Group of Twenty (G20)" commercial banks this week moved forward on the project by creating CLS Services Ltd, a private UK company charged with developing the system where payments are immediately offset by matched payments.</p>
<p>"In this project the world's biggest banks, normally fierce competitors, are working together to eliminate settlement risk which is something that global central banks are quite concerned about and eager to have addressed," said Gerhard Singer, a vice president at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt and project leader of the initiative.</p>
<p>The G20, turning over some 40 percent of the more than one trillion U.S. dollar a day foreign exchange market, plan to create a clearing system based on the principle of Continuous Linked Settlements (CLS), letting deals be settled immediately.</p>
<p>This central clearer would handle currencies where domestic payment systems are in operation and between countries where such systems have overlapping hours.</p>
<p>Singer said CLS would eliminate many hours of delay currently experienced in the settlement process, adding that it was precisely this waiting time that created risk for banks.</p>
<p>The new system would not eliminate existing bilateral and multilateral netting systems, which net out gross payments and receivables into a single payment in or out for each member, Singer said.</p>
<p>To date the 20 cooperating banks have chipped in $250,000 each towards the project's development costs, which are expected to total $70 to $80 million.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank, one of two German banks participating in G20, gave no information on how much the system will cost after it becomes operational at the end of 1999.</p>
<p>The unknown running costs as well as fears about possibly concentrating too much power in the hands of one bank have been cited as some of the potential problems associated with CLS.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank hosted a news conference to give more details about the project, which was unveiled earlier this week.</p>
<p>The benefit for banks is difficult to calculate precisely, but would be enormous, Singer said, noting CLS would eliminate time which spells risk.</p>
<p>Currently banks can wait up to three days for settlement and this delay constitutes a risk, sometimes called Herstatt risk after the German bank whose collapse in 1974 wrought havoc in the foreign exchange market because of unsettled deals.</p>
<p>Central banks have been particularly worried about so-called systemic risks, risks inherent in the system, and have urged more progress on containing such risk.</p>
<p>But to make CLS a success, at least 60 percent of all trades in the world's top currencies must be conducted through it, Singer said. The G20 is therefore tryng to recruit another 40 to 50 banks to participate in CLS, he said.</p>
<p>"We have already had interest expressed by some other leading German banks, and so we think there will be sufficient interest," he said.</p>
<p>Banks eager to participate must present at least an A minus rating, high base capital and a backup settlement.</p>
<p>The G20, formed in 1994, comprises the following banks: ABN AMRO, Bank of America, Bankers Trust, Barclays Bank, Banque Nationale de Paris, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Chase, CIBC, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Fuji Bank, HSBC Holdings, J.P. Morgan, National Westminster, Royal Bank of Canada, Swiss Bank Corp, Societe Generale and UBS.</p>
