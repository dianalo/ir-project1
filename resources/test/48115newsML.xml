<p>Australian shares closed weaker on Wednesday, the market weighed down by solid selling of major mining issues BHP, CRA and MIM as resource sentiment sagged on negative comments about the outlook for steel and copper prices from BHP managing director John Prescott on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index finished 9.6 points lower at 2,246.3. The September share price index futures ended down 15 points at 2,249, a 2.7 point premium to the underlying index.</p>
<p>The market was split between weak resource issues and firm industrials, but dealers said the heavy weighting of BHP within the All Ordinaries tipped the balance lower for the market.</p>
<p>"Prescott's comments started the slide on Tuesday but the market has become increasingly concerned about the outlook for the big Australian the longer the copper price remains depressed," a dealer from a Melbourne-based brokerage said.</p>
<p>BHP's exposure to copper increased sharply last year when the company acquired U.S.-based Magma Copper Co to become the world's third largest copper producer.</p>
<p>Dealers said the recent buoyancy of the Australian dollar had also brought the resources sector into focus for investors.</p>
<p>"The combination of negative factors has forced the market to look hard at the outlook for resources," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Benefiting from the slide in the resource sector were the major banks which outperformed the rest of the market on the day as investors looked to switch into a high-yield alternative.</p>
<p>Dealers said while banks would likely continue to benefit from switching, today's resource sell-off could trigger some bargain hunting on Thursday, especially if the Dow has a strong session later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Among results to arrive as the profit season winds down was full year numbers from Delta Gold which posted a sharply higher net profit of A$15.07 million.</p>
