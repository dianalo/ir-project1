<p>The son of the founder of Shoney's Inc said Friday management of the company should let shareholders meet to decide the future direction of the restaurant chain.</p>
<p>Responding to Shoney's management's lawsuit filed Thursday to block his call for a special meeting to replace the company's board, Raymond Schoenbaum called the litigation unnecessary and a waste of corporate assets.</p>
<p>Schoenbaum, who with his mother own an eight percent stake in the company, said management should "let the real owners of Shoney's decide as soon as possible the future direction of the company."</p>
<p>Shoney's management, in its lawsuit, wants the court to uphold bylaw amendments that it said seeks to insure orderly procedures for the holding of special shareholder meetings.</p>
<p>Shoney's also noted that Tennessee law permits only shareholders with a 10 percent stake in a company to demand a special meeting.</p>
<p>Schoenbaum noted, however, that the amendments were adopted after he delivered a demand to call a special meeting on August 19. The amendments, he said, would eliminate the right to set the date time and place of a meeting and prolong procedures before a meeting can be actually held.</p>
