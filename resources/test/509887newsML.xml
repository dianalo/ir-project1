<headline>NYMEX electricity settles lower after recent rise.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-15</dateline>

<p>NYMEX electricity futures settled mostly lower Tuesday on forecasts of warmer temperatures and return of several generating units from unplanned outages in the western U.S.</p>
<p>Those units included the 1,073 megawatt (MW) Diablo Canyon nuclear unit 2 in Avila Beach, Calif., 1,212 MW Helms pumped storage hydroelectric plant near Fresno, Calif., and 750 MW Navajo coal-fired power plant near Page, Ariz.,</p>
<p>Temperatures in the Pacific Northwest were forecast to continue to average near to slightly above normal, while readings in the Southwest were called to run four to 10 degrees Fahrenheit above normal through the early part of the weekend.</p>
<p>The power complex was pressured lower early, failing to extend its recent gains on strong cash market prices and significant amount of West's generating capacity off line.</p>
<p>May California-Oregon Border (COB) futures finished down 28 cents at $12.61 a megawatt hour (MWh) after traded between $12.45 and $12.95. June COB ended down nine cents at $12.29. Other COB months settled mostly 10 to 25 cents lower.</p>
<p>May Palo Verde (PV) finished down six cents at $15.89 after bouncing in a 10 cent range. June PV ended up eight cents at $16.93. Other PV contracts settled unchanged to down eight cents.</p>
<p>"It's basically range trading," said one East Coast paper broker.</p>
<p>Day-ahead electricity prices were generally talked lower today in light activity as many schedulers are absent to attend an industry conference which will end Thursday. Most next-day business was completed yesterday.</p>
<p>Today's retreat in futures prices seemed to be temporary. In over-the-counter activity, May COB was traded at $12.75, up 14 cents from the day's close, while May PV was last bid at $15.90.</p>
<p>NYMEX estimated 511 COB and 503 PV contracts were sold, up from Monday's 273 COB and 386 PV lots.</p>
