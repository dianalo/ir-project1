<p>The coupon rate on the Philippines' two-year fixed rate Treasury notes fell to 11.25 percent in the monthly auction from 11.875 percent in February, the Bureau of Treasury said on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The average rate likewise fell to 11.082 from 11.775 percent. Rates moved from 10.625 to 11.25 percent.</p>
<p>The auction had 5.86 billion pesos worth of bids, of which four billion pesos were awarded.</p>
<p>Traders said the slide in the two-year notes were instigated by the plunge in Treasury bill rates in Monday's auction.</p>
<p>This prompted the Philippine Central Bank to trim its overnight borrowing and lending rates by 0.1875 percentage point each to 10.25 and 12.75 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>There could have even been a steeper drop in the two-year coupon rate if the Central Bank's rate cuts were deeper, a dealer said.</p>
<p>However, "banks are beginning to get a little wary on the trend in rates," a big bank dealer said.</p>
<p>"A lot of them held off first," he said, since the Central Bank had not dropped its overnight rates significantly and may raise rates if there is peso speculation.</p>
