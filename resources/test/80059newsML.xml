<p>Total loans and advances extended by the banking institutions in Malaysia grew by 5.4 billion ringgit or 1.9 percent in August against an increase of 5.6 billion ringgit or 2.0 percent in July, the central bank said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The increase in loans was chanelled mainly to broad property (1.9 billion ringgit) and manufacturing (1.7 billion ringgit) sectors, Bank Negara said in a statement.</p>
<p>Credit channelled for consumption purposes fell by 34 million ringgit and to finance, insurance and business services sector by 13 million ringgit.</p>
<p>Total deposits mobilised by the banking system rose by 4.8 billion ringgit or 1.5 percent in August compared with an increase of 6.1 billion ringgit or 2.0 percent in the preceding month, the central bank said.</p>
<p>The bulk of the increase was placed with commercial banks (2.8 billion ringgit) and finance companies (2.6 billion ringgit), while deposits placed with merchant banks declined by 554 million ringgit.</p>
<p>As loans outpaced deposits, the banking system experienced a resource gap of 538 million ringgit in August compared with a surplus of 550 million ringgit in July, Bank Negara said.</p>
<p>The central bank said liquidity in the banking system remained ample in August, evident from the average holding of excess liquid assets, which remained unchanged at 2.4 billion ringgit. Net long-term funds raised in the capital market increased to 1.4 billion ringgit in August from 847 million in July, it said.</p>
<p>Bank Negara's net international reserves increased by 206 million ringgit from the end-July level to 67.4 billion ringgit at the end of August, sufficient to finance four months of retained imports.</p>
