<p>India's federal police chief, who has spearheaded a criminal investigation into the leader of Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's party, has been transferred to a new post, a government spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) director Joginder Singh had been moved to the Home (Interior) Ministry and replaced by special CBI director R.C. Sharma.  </p>
<p>"Mr Joginder Singh, director CBI, has been promoted and posted as special secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs," the spokesman said. He did not offer any reason for the shift.</p>
<p>Singh, who took charge of the CBI last August, has overseen a string of high-profile investigations into political leaders.</p>
<p>He has drawn criticism from supporters of Laloo Prasad Yadav, chief minister of the eastern state of Bihar and head of Gujral's Janata Dal party. Yadav and 55 others have been indicted in a $280-million corruption case.</p>
<p>Supporters of Yadav, who says he is innocent, have threatened to break away from the Janata Dal and boycott organisational elections set for Thursday.</p>
