<p>Brazil were expected to shine in Paris next year at the soccer World Cup finals but nobody thought they would impress at the French Open until Gustavo Kuerten came along.</p>
<p>Kuerten, who became the first Brazilian man to reach a Grand Slam final by beating Belgian Filip Dewulf in four sets on Friday, has won the hearts of Parisians with his Prince Charming qualities.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old from Florianopolis, regarded merely as an exotic attraction before the event started, has delighted the crowds with his fresh, relaxed attitude and a spectacular attacking game.</p>
<p>His on court demeanour is impeccable. He rarely contests a line call, jokes with the ball boys and after a match is equally happy to mix with the fans as the media.</p>
<p>"I try to be the same guy off and on the court and maybe that's what brings me luck," he said after his 6-1 3-6 6-1 7-6 victory on Friday. "Even if I win the final, I'll still be just like any other guy you could meet on the street."</p>
<p>Even before his semifinal victory, Kuerten, who wears a flashy, yellow and blue outfit, had earned many headlines in the sports pages of the Brazilian newspapers, usually more interested in soccer.</p>
<p>"Football is the number one sport by far but now, they're discovering tennis," said Kuerten, who will meet either Sergi Bruguera of Spain or Australian Pat Rafter in Sunday's final.</p>
<p>He added he had received a fax of encouragement from Paris St Germain's Brazilian World Cup player Rai.</p>
<p>"He told me he would come and see me in the final," said Kuerten. "I'm ever so pleased."</p>
<p>The lean Brazilian, ranked a modest 66 in the world, won his first tournament, a satellite contest in Curitiba, Brazil, just before coming to Paris.</p>
<p>On the clay courts of Roland Garros, he has looked more like a seasoned professional, knocking over Austrian Thomas Muster, Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine and holder Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia on his way to the final.</p>
<p>"Every kid who loves tennis dreams of playing the final of a Grand Slam tournament," he said. "I'm no exception. It really is a dream come true. I'm so happy I just can't find the words."</p>
<p>Asked if he thought he could win the tournament, Kuerten replied, "Why not?".</p>
<p>"I'm looking forward to going out there on Sunday with the big crowd and everything. And if I stay calm and just go for my shots, you never know, I could win."</p>
