<p>Japan's crude import statistics for January showed the country's growing taste for cheaper, heavier type Middle Eastern crudes, oil industry sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>"Heavy crudes are becoming attractive price-wise, because of the growing price difference with light crudes," a trader with a refiner said.</p>
<p>Spot market price differentials between Abu Dhabi Murban, a light crude and Dubai crude, which is heavier, was mostly below the key chart level of $1.83 until late November 1996 but has since moved steadily higher.</p>
<p>Japan's crude imports in January totalled 24.31 million kilolitres, up 3.7 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).</p>
<p>Of that, Middle Eastern crudes accounted for 84.5 percent of total January imports, compared with 81.3 percent a month earlier, MITI statistics showed.</p>
<p>In January, the United Arab Emirates was Japan's top supplier, providing 30.1 percent of Japan's crude imports or 7.32 million kilolitres (kl), followed by Saudi Arabia's 21.7 percent, or 5.28 million kl.</p>
<p>Although smaller in volume, imports from countries such as Kuwait and the Neutral Zone, producers of heavy type crudes, grew substantially.</p>
<p>Imports from Kuwait grew 21.6 percent year-on-year, to 1.65 million kl, while imports from the Neutral Zone rose 14.3 percent to 1.37 million kl.</p>
<p>The start-up of secondary facilities at some refineries has also contributed to greater demand for heavier crudes, traders said.</p>
<p>Showa Shell Sekiyu KK last November started operating a residue fluid catalytic cracker (RFCC) at its Yokkaichi plant.</p>
<p>The cracker, which produces gasoline, gas oil and kerosene from fuel oil, has a capacity of 55,000 barrels per day (bpd).</p>
<p>The cracker is expected to save Showa Shell's crude procurement costs substantially, a company spokesman said.</p>
<p>Compared with heavy crudes, light crudes tend to yield a greater amount of middle distillates but are more costly.</p>
<p>Secondary facilities such as crackers, improve the yield of middle distillates, such as gasoline and kerosene, from heavy crudes.</p>
<p>In recent years, Japan's demand for heavy oil products such as fuel oil, mainly used to fuel power plants and boilers, has been falling, while middle distillate demand has been rising.</p>
<p>Tonen Corp said last Friday it planned to start operation of a residual fuel cracking unit with capacity of 25,000 bpd at its Kawasaki refinery by the end of the first-half 1997.</p>
