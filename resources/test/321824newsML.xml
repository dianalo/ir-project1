<p>New York State lawmakers on Tuesday were expected to take up a controversial bill to award a handful of Assembly members a total of $62,500 in stipends, called "lulus," the New York Post said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The paper said a deal restoring the stipends was reached over the weekend as part of a bigger pact that clears the way for approval of several stalled items.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for the Senate Majority Leader, Joseph Bruno (R-Troy) and the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver (D-Manhattan), were not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>The state constitution bars lawmakers from increasing their own pay during their term in office, the paper said, adding lawyers for Gov George Pataki were studying whether restoring the lulus, which ended in November, would be legal.</p>
<p>It quoted the governor as saying on Monday that he saw no legal problems with restoring the stipends.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the New York Public Interest Group, which in 1976 won a challenge to lulus handed out by the then Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut, said its lawyers were studying the issue.</p>
