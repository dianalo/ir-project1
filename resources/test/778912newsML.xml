<p>The American Petroleum Institute (API) said Tuesday that total gasoline stocks fell for the sixth consecutive week, but gasoline's recent price rally may be taken out of the fast lane since the API also showed a large build in reformulated gasoline (RFG) stocks.</p>
<p>"The build in RFG negates the bullishness of gasoline. There was an increase of 2.2 million barrels of RFG and more than 100 percent of it in PADD 1 (U.S. Northeast)," said Richard Redash, senior energy analyst at Prudential Securities in New York.</p>
<p>RFG is the grade deliverable against the NYMEX contract and it is primarily used by consumers in the East Coast. Total gasoline stocks fell 2.71 million barrels but RFG stocks grew 2.46 million barrels in the East Coast. The data reflects the week ended August 1.</p>
<p>Since late June, gasoline supply has been tightening due to high demand stoked by a strong U.S. economy. The API said total gasoline stocks stood at 191.9 million barrels, which is near historical lows.</p>
<p>Reflecting supply tightness, September gasoline has risen more than 10 percent in the last week, and prompt crude has followed, rising $1.00 a barrel in the same period.</p>
<p>The reason behind growing supply may be that demand may be easing.</p>
<p>Redash said the implied demand for RFG came down from last week's high of 3.176 million barrels per day (bpd) to 2.285 million bpd this week.</p>
<p>Tom Knight, trader with Fina Oil in New Jersey, said the API numbers looked simply neutral as implied gasoline demand slipped to 8.4 million bpd from a four-week average of 8.7 million bpd.</p>
<p>But, Knight also noted that although the low import figure of 189,000 barrels, a decline of 75,000 barrels for the week, exacerbated the gasoline draw, it was likely a one week breather before an uptick in cargoes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, crude stocks rose a mere 474,000 barrels, leaving stocks mostly unchanged despite higher crude demand by refiners. Refinery utilization capacity rose a full percentage point to a torrid 97.1 percent.</p>
<p>"What the crude figure says is that crude supply and demand are basically in balance for now," said Thomas Blakeslee, trader and analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc in New York.</p>
<p>Distillate stocks, which are comprised of heating oil and diesel, rose 2.19 million barrels, an indication that the stocks were back to their seasonal pattern of growth, dealers said.</p>
<p>Distillate stocks fell for the past two consecutive weeks due to movement of diesel to secondary channels, dealers said.</p>
