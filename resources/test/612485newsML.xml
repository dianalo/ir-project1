<p>The chairman of Rhone-Poulenc SA, Jean-Rene Fourtou, said on Saturday he was maintaining the company's forecast of a 20 percent increase in 1997 earnings per share.</p>
<p>"I confirm the outlook we made in the autumn of 1996, that is to say that we think that we are able to realise an increase in our earnings per share of 20 percent and that despite the setbacks we have had with albumin products in a joint venture company with Hoechst which is called Centeon," he told Radio Classique radio.</p>
<p>In 1996, Rhone's earnings per share were 8.44 francs.</p>
<p>Fourtou said that he saw no reason the divest of the fibres or chemicals divisons but noted the company was selling assets within these sectors.</p>
<p>"I have said clearly that there are asset sales underway or being discussed in the chemicals and the fibres (sectors) to get a portfolio of activities which is less cyclical, less capital intensive and more based on innovation," he added.</p>
<p>"I have said that we want to keep the two activities chemicals and fibres because I believe that in the long run... it will be an asset for the company"</p>
<p>He re-iterated that he saw no benefits from a merger between Rhone-Poulenc's pharmaceutical activities and Elf-Aquitaine unit Sanofi.</p>
<p>"Sanofi has almost the same weaknesses as we," he said.</p>
