<p>Second quarter earnings for Mexican glass giant Vitro should be encouraging but down from the first quarter, analysts said.</p>
<p>"We expect a good report because of the recently remodeled flat glass oven that operated at 60 percent of installed capacity for the quarter, and the new line of refrigerator production," Mexico City Caspian analyst Martin Lara said.  </p>
<p>Three analysts surveyed by Reuters estimated earnings per share of 1.18 pesos for the second quarter, compared to a 3.06 peso loss in the same period in 1996. Second quarter earnings per share are expected to be down from 1.39 pesos in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The fall in earnings from the first quarter was attributed to lesser monetary gains.</p>
<p>Analysts said the focus of the report should be in operating performance. They said earnings figures will not be comparable to the same quarter in 1996, when Vitro still owned U.S.-based Anchor Glass. Vitro sold Anchor Glass in February.  </p>
<p>"Vitro's operating margin should also grow. In the first quarter of 1997, it was 18.4 percent and I expect 18.8 percent in the second quarter," Lara said.</p>
<p>Sales for the second three months of the year were expected to be about 4.724 million pesos, compared to 4.608 million pesos in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Analysts saluted Vitro's health, but suggested further measures to focus on the company's core products.  </p>
<p>"In my personal opinion, Vitro should soon rid itself of the (Grupo Serfin ) investment as it did with Anchor Glass, and redistribute these resources to other basic businesses where it has had good performance," Bear Stearns analyst Sandy Pique said.</p>
<p>Vitro last year took a write-off on its dilution of its stake in the banking group.</p>
