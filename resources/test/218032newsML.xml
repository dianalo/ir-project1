<p>S&amp;T Bancorp Inc said Tuesday it had agreed to acquire Peoples Bank of Unity in a deal valued at $94 million.</p>
<p>The combined company will have assets of about $1.7 billion and equity of $218 million.</p>
<p>Peoples Bank shareholders will receive 26.25 shares of S&amp;T in exchange for each share of Peoples.</p>
<p>Peoples Bank has 115,660 shares outstanding, S&amp;T said.  </p>
<p>S&amp;T sees the deal initially being modestly dilutive to earnings, but accretive in 1998.</p>
<p>"We expect to achieve substantial cost savings which will offset the initial modest dilution. In addition to the cost savings, we believe there are numerous opportunities for increased revenues, particularly in the area of restructuring Peoples's balance sheet and offering new products and services to their customers," said S&amp;T Chairman Robert Duggan.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to be a tax-free exchange and will be accounted for as a pooling of interests, S&amp;T said.  </p>
<p>The deal, which remains subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals, is expected to close by April 30.</p>
<p>Separately, S&amp;T said it had rescinded its share repurchase authorization. In December 1995 S&amp;T's board approved a plan to buy back up to 350,000 shares.</p>
