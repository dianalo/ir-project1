<headline>SEC seeks comments on tax-exempt money fund rules.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-12-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday requested public comment on a series of proposed revisions to its rule governing tax-exempt money market funds.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions to SEC's Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 are due January 24, according to the draft rules.  </p>
<p>The SEC voted in late March 1996 to tighten standards for the quality and diversity of bonds held by tax-exempt money market funds.</p>
<p>But the commission on August 14 temporarily postponed the effective date of the new rules, which was originally set for October 3, so that it could consider some "technical" changes.</p>
<p>An SEC official said last week that the proposed revisions will not affect the major rule changes affecting tax-exempt money funds that the SEC made in March. "Nothing we're doing here will affect any of those decisions," the official said.  </p>
<p>One technical revision, he said, would "clarify" the way that guarantees and demand features are treated under Rule 2a-7.</p>
<p>"To the extent that there was confusion as to whether guarantees and unconditional demand features were being treated the same way for various purposes, this should clear this up," he said.</p>
<p>The SEC voted March 21 to bar funds that invest in tax-exempt securities nationwide from investing more than five percent of their assets in the securities of a single issuer.</p>
<p>The move was designed to prevent a tax-exempt fund from putting "all its eggs in one basket," the SEC said.</p>
<p>But because of the limited supply of high-quality tax-exempt securities in some states, funds that invest only in the bonds of single states must "be diversified at the five-percent level, but only as to 75 percent of their assets," the SEC said.</p>
<p>Single state funds must disclose in prospectuses that there are increased risks associated with their policy of concentrating on the bonds of one state.</p>
