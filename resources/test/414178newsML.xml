<p>Benchmark LIFFE cocoa futures motored higher to close above 900 stg on Monday, securing a bullish technical reversal after local bids buoyed the spot March contract.</p>
<p>A succession of bids by one local trader propelled the expiring March 28 stg higher to 895 stg a tonne, mobilising a spate of short covering by funds in other nearby positions.</p>
<p>Sterling's weaker tone in afternoon currency dealings also helped keep producer sellers at bay, traders said.</p>
<p>The March/May spread, a monitor of spot availability, tightened to 9-10 stg from 17-18 in early trading.</p>
<p>"Nobody wanted it (March). Now suddenly everybody wants it," said one trader, adding that spreads had tightened across the board.</p>
<p>After a fierce struggle to conquer 900, most-active May resurfaced above the crucial chart level, finishing at a one-month high of 904 stg and paving the way for a rally to the next target of 914-922 stg. The intraday high was 907 stg.</p>
<p>"It's a constuctive close. This may be the time the market does rally," said another trader. But he thought March was being pulled higher by some "funny games" as it entered its first notice day with 2,785 lots delivery notices posted.</p>
<p>Some traders reckon cocoa's oversold condition and fund shorts mean the market could be preparing for an upside correction, with relatively little more selling left to absorb.</p>
<p>Prices blipped up just before the midday pause after spending most of the morning in negative territory. But most players took comfort in large delivery notices posted against March which suggested a smooth expiry at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Friday's CFTC Commitment of Traders Report showed speculative positions (including non-reportable) were still net short of 1,819 lots in New York in the week ending February 25 despite having dropped from two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Technically, the area above 855 on May is regarded as a base from which the market may challenge new resistance levels, including 938.</p>
