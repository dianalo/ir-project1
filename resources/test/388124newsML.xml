<p>U.S. House Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston asked the White House on Wednesday for a list of programs President Clinton has asked be terminated in his 1998 budget.</p>
<p>The Louisiana Republican said he understood Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin recently referred to a master list of 254 programs slated for termination, details of which Livingston would like provided to his panel.  </p>
<p>In a letter to Office of Management and Budget director Frank Raines, Livingston said, "I'm hoping you will direct me to this listing in the president's budget. If it's not in his request, please explain why it's excluded."</p>
<p>OMB has released only a list of 157 selected projects and programs which the president would like closed. But this list inlcudes the local law enforcement block grants which have strong backing from Republican lawmakers.</p>
<p>"Over the past two years, the Appropriations Committee has successfully eliminated 297 programs and we are looking to further this effort in the upcoming budget process," Livingston wrote.</p>
