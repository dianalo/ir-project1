<p>The Dow industrials see-sawed their way to stand slightly higher at midday after stalling once again in their siege of the 6000 level.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial average, up 30 points in morning activity, succumbed for the second straight day to profit-taking to enter the midsession up two points to 5982.</p>
<p>"The assault on 6000 is not over," said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co, "but some undercurrents of profit-taking, while not overbearing, are keeping the market in check."  </p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite also receded from its morning highs to slip to losses at midday, falling five points to 1246.</p>
<p>Early in the session, bullish comments about the semiconductor industry from Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack helped fuel a rally in technology stocks, among them bellwether Intel Corp, which hit an all-time high.</p>
<p>However, later in the session, Salomon Brothers downgraded Intel shares to hold from buy, citing Intel's high share price as one reason for the move. Shares in Intel, which hit 107 at their peak, eventually slipped 3/8 to 104-1/4.</p>
