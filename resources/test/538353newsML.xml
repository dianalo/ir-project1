<p>"The third time pays for all," says an old Greek proverb and so it proved -- gloriously, noisily and at long last for Olympiakos, the new European basketball champions.</p>
<p>After defeats in the finals of 1994 and 1995, Olympiakos took the Final Four title at Rome's Palaeur stadium, packed to its 12,000 capacity on Thursday, beating Barcelona 73-58 thanks largely to another irresistible performance by American playmaker David Rivers.</p>
<p>Once a team mate of Magic Johnson at Los Angeles Lakers, Rivers topscored with 26 points, just two fewer than the 28 he notched up to help sink Ljubljana of Slovenia in Tuesday's semifinals.</p>
<p>Coach Dusan Ivkovic was reluctant to single out Rivers but knows just how influential he was during the tournament and the lengthy qualifying which brought the Greek club to Rome.</p>
<p>"It was a wonderful game," Ivkovic said. "Rivers has been designated MVP (most valuable player) but to me he is like all the others. They were all good."</p>
<p>Olympiakos struggled with injuries earlier in the season and after the first 16 games of qualifying had a modest 9-7 record. Many thought their title hopes would end in the quarter-finals against holders Panathinaikos, who had home advantage but Olympiakos won a remarkable game 69-49.</p>
<p>Rivers, carried high by his team mates on Thursday, said: "There have been a lot of doubts through the year but we just stayed focused and kept our sights on our goal."</p>
<p>The raucous ranks of the 7,000 Olympiakos faithful had to suffer for a while before that goal was finally achieved.</p>
<p>Seven minutes into the game the Greek side had only two points on the board (2-9) and it was not until five minutes before halftime that they edged ahead at 20-18.</p>
<p>Thanks to 14 points from Rivers they went into halftime leading 31-29 and then, in a key phase after the break, they confined Barcelona to just nine points in nine minutes, opening up a double-figure margin and then holding on comfortably.</p>
<p>Ivkovic said: "It was rather difficult for us at the beginning but afterwards we got control. We defended very well and we blocked Sasha Djordjevic."</p>
<p>The brilliant Serb has turned round Barcelona's season since his arrival in Spain in January and in style and influence he was every bit a match for Rivers, at least in the first half.</p>
<p>But he was less evident in the second period and had an off-night with his shooting, scoring just six points against his average for Barcelona of 14.</p>
<p>Losing coach Aito Garcia Reneses said: "The main problem for us was that we did not play as we usually do."</p>
<p>Ivkovic paid tribute to the Olympiakos fans. "They are unique in the world," he told reporters. "Without them basketball would not have the importance it has now."</p>
<p>For the 3,000 or so Barcelona fans there was more heartache to heap on last year's when their club lost by just one point to Panathinaikos in controversial circumstances. They have now lost four finals in six appearances in the Final Four since 1989.</p>
<p>Next year the tournament is in Barcelona, raising the Spanish team's hopes that home advantage might bring success at last.</p>
