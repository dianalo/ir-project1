<p>Shares in Yaohan Japan Corp jumped on Thursday morning, helped by bargain-hunting after its recent sharp slides, traders said.</p>

<p>Japan Securities Finance Co Ltd said on Wednesday that it had issued a "warning" that it may run short of shares in Yaohan Japan Corp to lend for margin trade, but that has had little impact on the shares so far, the traders said.</p>
