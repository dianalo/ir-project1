<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures ended with modest gains late Friday in sluggish trade, lifted by reports of steady to firmer weekend cash prices in the face of more below-normal weather early next week.</p>
<p>May climbed 3.3 cents to close at $1.933 per million British thermal units. June settled 2.8 cent higher at $1.995. Other deferreds ended up by one to 3.5 cents.</p>
<p>"We were under pressure much of the day, but they (short) covered up for the weekend. I don't think you can read much into today's action," said one East Coast trader, noting prices were still bound in recent technical ranges.  </p>
<p>While traders said favorable spreads and cold weather early next week could support prices near-term, they said bloated storage, particularly in the East, left buyers with plenty of leverage to limit the upside.</p>
<p>Forecasters were looking for more below-normal Midwest and eastern weather early next week though more seasonal temperatures were predicted later in the week.</p>
<p>Chart traders still pegged May trendline support at $1.88, with better buying likely at $1.85 and $1.825. Resistance remained at $2 and then at $2.045-2.05 and $2.10.</p>
<p>In the cash, Gulf Coast prices were talked up a few cents Friday to the mid-$1.90s or better. Midcontinent pipes scored similar gains to the mid-$1.80s. Weekend gas at the New York city gate was talked down a few cents to the $2.35-2.40 area.</p>
<p>The NYMEX Henry Hub 12-month strip rose 2.4 cents to $2.134. NYMEX said 22,161 Hub contracts traded, down slightly from Thursday's revised tally of 24,748.</p>
<p>No Permian or Alberta natgas contracts traded Friday.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, May finished 2.9 cents higher at $1.799, while deferreds ended up by one-half to 2.5 cents. The East/West spread widened by 0.4 cent to 13.4 cents (NYMEX premium). KCBT said 92 lots changed hands, up from Thursday's total of 86.</p>
