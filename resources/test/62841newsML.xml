<p>Key December Japanese government bond (JGB) futures ended Tokyo at the day's high on Wednesday, recovering early losses which stemmed partly from corrective selling to their steep advance on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A fall in Tokyo share prices also aided JGBs' recovery.</p>
<p>"After having tested the December's downside in sympathy with U.S. Treasury bonds' tumble overnight, many found that 121.80 was a firm support due to buy-on-dips demand," said a trader at an agricultural bank.</p>
<p>The December contract ended at the day's high of 122.10, after spending most of the day in negative territory.  </p>
<p>The 182nd JGB yield rose as high as 2.880 percent compared with its 2.825 percent close on Tuesday.</p>
<p>There were signs that investors who had parked their funds in the money market in the expectation of a credit-tightening had begun to divert that to the long-term debt market after giving up such hopes, a senior money trader said.</p>
<p>The pooled cash is estimated to total four to five trillion yen and bonds are believed to be the main beneficiary of the funds, he said.</p>
<p>"As a result, volatility in the JGBs will increase as the nature of those funds is speculative," said a bank trader.  </p>
<p>Traders also said the 161st and 163rd 10-year JGBs, the cheapest JGBs for delivery against the September contract due for delivery on Friday, were still scarce in the market.</p>
<p>The repo rate of the 161st JGBs went above 10 percent at one point this morning.</p>
<p>Cash deliveries for September are scheduled on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said that some short-position holders are having a hard time rolling over contracts to borrow deliverable bonds beyond half-year corporate book closings on September 30. -- Yoshiko Mori, Tokyo Treasury Desk 813-3432-8676</p>
