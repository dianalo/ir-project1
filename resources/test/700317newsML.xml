<p>The UK's FTSE 100 index scored its biggest one-day gain in point terms for five years on Tuesday, in a pre-Budget rally that caught analysts and dealers by surprise after weeks of cautious trading.</p>
<p>The leading share index closed 123.7 points or 2.7 percent higher at 4,728.3, its biggest gain since a rise of 136 points in April 1992 and boosting its value by some 21 billion stg. In percentage terms, the rise was also the biggest since 1992.</p>
<p>Some said the market had looked due for a rally after its recent shaky performance, dogged by worries over the contents of Britain's first budget under a Labour government in 19 years.</p>
