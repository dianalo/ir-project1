<p>The White House said on Thursday it would welcome China's signing two human rights covenants, but added that the topic of human rights would continue to be an issue between the two countries.</p>
<p>Asked about China's announcement earlier that it was "actively considering" signing the covenants, White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters: "That would be a welcome development."  </p>
<p>McCurry said that if China were to sign the covenants, the United States would take that into consideration in its decisions on whether to censure China at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva.</p>
<p>"We would consider that development in connection with any action in Geneva," he added. "But our concerns about human rights would certainly continue and would certainly continue to be an aspect of our presentations as we exchange views with the Chinese side."</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, asked if China would sign the two international covenants, said: "We are actively considering this," adding that it was at Beijing's discretion when to join.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited China this week for her first talks with Chinese leaders, but reported no concrete progress on human rights or breakthroughs on other issues.</p>
