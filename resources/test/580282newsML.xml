<p>Istanbul shares extended morning losses in selling prompted by escalating political worries at the start of the afternoon session, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said remarks by Mesut Yilmaz, Turkey's main opposition party leader that he was in full agreement with a dissident government deputy on forming a secularist coalition caused fears over the future of the shaky Islamist-led coalition to increase.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100 stood at 1,365 at 1135, down 30 points, or 2.15 percent from Monday. It was down 1.29 percent in thin trade in the morning session.  </p>
<p>"The expectation of an alternative government to replace the current one is about to develop in the market. If talks on a secularist alliance produce a positive outcome, the market may quickly recover," said Hasan Soydan from Garanti securities.</p>
<p>"But the index may remain in tight ranges for today," he added.</p>
<p>Brokers said volume was extremely thin as players kept to the sidelines amid caution.</p>
