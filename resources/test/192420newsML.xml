<p>Asian debt markets offered a few tidbits on Friday and bankers promise more action next week.</p>
<p>More details emerged on Chase Manhattan Bank's HK$1.5 billion floating rate certificates of deposit issue, which was quietly launched on Thursday.</p>
<p>The three-year deal pays a margin of 27.5 basis points over the one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate and was re-offered at 99.925 to give a re-offer yield of HIBOR plus 30 basis points.</p>
<p>With fees, the all-in return is 33 basis points to co-lead managers. Senior managers receive 31.5 basis points and managers get 30 basis points. Participants own the certificates at par.</p>
<p>Bankers report that syndication of the deal differs from the norm in that arranger Chase Manhattan Asia is inviting banks for specific levels.</p>
<p>The FRCDs are expected to be rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service, which would put them a notch higher than the FRCDs of HongKong Bank and Standard Chartered Bank, which are rated A2. "Compared with Standard Chartered and HongKong Bank, Chase is better rated and the deal looks pretty attractive," said one banker.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered Bank's certificates due in December 1999 are trading in the mid-30s, traders said.</p>
<p>In London overnight, Korea Export-Import Bank launched a US$350 million Yankee bond.</p>
<p>The bond has a 10-year final maturity but can be put after seven years. It was priced to yield 45 basis points over the February 2004 U.S. Treasury note. Lehman Brothers was the lead.</p>
<p>Kexim's prior bond issue, a percent five-year Eurobond, was priced to yield 44 basis points over comparable Treasuries.</p>
<p>Bankers in Hong Kong said Southern Co may choose arrangers for its US$850 million loan that will go toward financing its acquisition of Hong Kong's Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA).</p>
<p>U.S. company Southern last month made an offer to acquire a majority stake in CEPA, a unit of Hopewell Holdings.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, CEPA shareholders will receive US$2.1 billion from Southern and US$600 million in dividends for 80 percent of the company.</p>
<p>In addition to the loan financing, Southern is expected to put up about US$1.2 billion in cash.</p>
<p>Bankers here said it is difficult to determine how much the pricing of the loan should reflect U.S. risk, because Southern Co is a U.S. company, and how much should reflect Asian risk, because CEPA's projects are in the region, primarily in China, Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>"It is an unusual, abnormal credit structure...there are a lot of credit issues to be resolved," a banker said.</p>
<p>The deal is attractive, however, because participation could help pave the way for future financings of CEPA projects, bankers said.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, bankers said there are a number of deals expected to launch next week, including large transactions for South Korea's Cho Hung Bank and Seoulbank.</p>
<p>Korea French Banking Corp and Korea Merchant Banking Corp also are expected to bring deals.</p>
<p>There were rumours that Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway Corp is taking bids on a HK$3-5 billion financing, but the MTRC was not available for comment.</p>
