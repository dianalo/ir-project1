<p>Rebhold has bought three businesses in the food, freight and liquor sectors for 61 million rand.</p>
<p>It said in a statement on Wednesday that the businesses were Cape-based freight forwarder Trans Global, Gauteng-based McFoods and Cape-based Boland Wine.</p>
<p>"All these businesses are well-managed, niche businesses and in each case there is an existing relationship with the Rebhold group," chief executive Jacques Kempen said.</p>
<p>The acquisitions would be financed through the issue of a maximum of 11.4 million shares in up to three tranches.</p>
<p>The company said the pro forma effect of the acquisitions on earnings per share would be a 31 percent or nine cent increase to 38 cents a share based on a set of assumptions.</p>
<p>These were that earnings for the year to June 30, 1997 would amount to 29 cents a share and that the acquisition had been effective in the year to June 30, 1997.</p>
<p>Also that the acquisitions, together with that of HoneyFields announced in February, achieved profits warranted by the vendors for the period July 1, 1997 to June 30, 1998.</p>
