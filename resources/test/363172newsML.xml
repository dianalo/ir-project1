<p>Ecuador's military called for a quick solution to the country's political crisis on Friday, after Congress dramatically voted to oust President Abdala Bucaram and two other politicians staked claims to the presidency.</p>
<p>"This situation, which is extremely grave for our life as a nation, has caused uncertainty and a terrible sense of unease in the democratic-minded armed forces," military chiefs said in a statement.</p>
<p>The statement, seen by some commentators as raising the specter of a military coup, was read at a pre-dawn news conference by armed forces chief Gen. Paco Moncayo after he and other senior military officers met with a defiant Bucaram behind closed doors at the presidential palace.</p>
<p>Bucaram was voted out of office on Thursday on grounds of mental incompetence by an extraordinary session of Congress, in the midst a 48-hour nationwide general strike protesting austerity measures.</p>
<p>Congress then swore in its leader, Fabian Alarcon, to replace him as interim president as Bucaram vowed defiantly to serve out his term. The military said Vice President Rosalia Arteaga had also issued a decree declaring her own right to the presidency.</p>
<p>Moncayo said the military was "absolutely apolitical" and would not seek to fill the yawning power vacuum created by Bucaram's removal by lawmakers. But the statement urged a rapid end to Ecuador's political chaos, saying, "a solution cannot be awaited for too long."</p>
<p>The military, which ruled Ecuador for seven years until 1970, could serve as a mediator to end political infighting, it said.</p>
<p>"Unity between the people and armed forces can help us overcome this critical hour," it added.</p>
<p>Bucaram, fighting for his political survival, gave a brief and defiant statement to reporters at the Carondelet presidential palace shortly before his meeting with the military.</p>
<p>Calling Thursday night's 44-34 vote deposing him for mental incompetence an act of "judicial barbarity", he said he had no intention of leaving the job he was popularly elected to just six months ago.</p>
<p>Critics have said Bucaram prefers wine, women and singing -- including a recent Spanish-language recording of "Jail House Rock" -- to matters of state. But before his secretive talks with Ecuador's generals, Bucaram said he was still calling the shots inside the ornate palace.</p>
<p>"The power of businessmen and the power of bankers ... will never be as powerful as the constitution," he said, suggesting that the bid to depose him had been engineered by Ecuador's economic elite.</p>
<p>"I am the only president elected by the poor and people of Ecuador," he said.</p>
<p>Bucaram dismissed Alarcon as a member of a "congressional dictatorship" that had failed to pull off an "anti-democratic" grab for power.</p>
<p>The standoff between the 44-year-old Bucaram and Alarcon, 50, could drag on for days and prompt potentially violent street protests against Bucaram if he insists on clinging to power.</p>
<p>Late on Thursday night army troops clashed with thousands of demonstrators who ringed the presidential palace demanding Bucaram leave office immediately. Troops used tear gas and fired a few volleys of rifle shots into the air to disperse the demonstrators.</p>
<p>"It's the night of the three presidents," one TV news commentator said. "Perhaps it can be the night of the generals too."</p>
<p>Ecuador's Constitution is extremely vague on who should replace a sitting president and it was not immediately clear if Bucaram, or anyone else could mount a serious legal challenge to Alarcon's appointment as acting president until August 1998.</p>
<p>A supposed populist known as "El Loco", or "Madman", Bucaram took office promising to be the president of Ecuador's vast army of poor.</p>
<p>But his ouster by Congress came after the country was shut down by a massive nationwide strike on Wednesday and Thursday to protest against the severe belt-tighening measures his government clamped on Ecuador in early January.</p>
<p>The measures helped drive Bucaram's approval rating down almost as quickly as the cost of living shot up. They included electricity and gas rate hikes totalling more than 200 percent and a 60 percent rise in bus fares.</p>
