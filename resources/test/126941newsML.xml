<p>The SEC's new municipal disclosure rule has not dramatically improved information flow to investors in the tax exempt market, but it is costing dealers millions of dollars, a lawyer for a major bond firm said.</p>
<p>David Levy, general counsel for capital markets at Smith Barney Inc, said the Securities and Exchange Commission can solve the situation by establishing a "safe harbor" that would allow firms participating in bond syndicates to rely on lead managers to review municipalities' disclosures.  </p>
<p>Under 1994 amendments to the SEC's municipal disclosure Rule 15c2-12, municipal issuers make pledges to provide ongoing disclosure to investors. Dealers must have a system in place to receive the information that issuers provide to the market.</p>
<p>"The rule has not dramatically improved the quality of information available to most investors.  Nor has it dramatically increased liquidity," Levy said during a workshop session at a Public Securities Association conference here.  </p>
<p>"But the rule has already cost underwriters and dealers millions of dollars to establish the technology needed to comply with the rule," Levy said.</p>
<p>"Given the volume of underwriting in the competitive market alone, the number of manhours is staggering," he said. Levy said that is the case whether underwriters "farm out" the work to law firms or review the so-called issuer "undertakings" in-house.  </p>
<p>"And because each underwriter, not only syndicate managers, is technically required to ascertain that the issuer has done what it is supposed to do, thousands of manhours are spent by one firm duplicating the efforts of others," Levy said.</p>
<p>Levy said in both the competitive and negotiated markets, issuers and syndicate members routinely rely on the senior manager to perform a variety of services.</p>
<p>"It seems to me that one service that underwriters should be able to rely on the lead manager to provide is the review of the continuing disclosure undertaking," he said.</p>
<p>Levy also criticized the guidance that the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board has been providing dealers on how to comply with the board's pay-to-play rule G-37. He said "Q &amp; A's" released by the board offer conflicting advice.</p>
<p>"The board has created an unworkable situation for those charged with establishing and following compliance procedures" at municipal bond firms, Levy said.</p>
