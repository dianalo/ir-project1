<p>Bernard Arnault, the flamboyant French entrepreneur who controls LVMH, will detail his plans for a mega-drinks merger with Guinness Plc and Grand Metropolitan Plc later this week.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the 48-year old Breton said he would make a written proposal to Tony Greener of Guinness and George Bull of GrandMet before the end of the week after the three discussed the outlines of the plan on July 3.</p>
<p>She denied newspaper reports that Arnault would suggest a swap with Guinness of its stake in the cognac business for the British group's stake in champagne.</p>
<p>"In the discussions that have taken place between Guinness, Grand Metropolitan Plc and LVMH, there has been mention -- and this was a verbal suggestion by the British -- of a split between cognac and champagne," she said.</p>
<p>"This is not a solution LVMH wants to pursue, nor one which is being studied," she added.</p>
<p>Some French newspapers and the Daily Telegraph had suggested LVMH would want to sell its 66 percent stake in the Hennessy cognac business to Guinness and buy back the 34 percent in the champagne business.</p>
<p>"LVMH is still working on the hypothesis of a three-way marriage," the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>A financial analyst said the reported cognac-for-champagne swap made no economic sense. "Even though sales in the Far East are not good at the moment, profitabilty remains excellent and much better than in champagne."</p>
<p>Financial analysts say that the triple merger, which would crown Arnault's trophy board of corporate deals, made sense economically and would create better shareholder value than the planned 24 billion stg ($40.5 billion) GMG Brands merger of the two British groups, announced in May.</p>
<p>But they wondered whether the British companies would want to go ahead with a deal which would give Arnault a large stake in the new group.</p>
<p>"Arnault is not the most easy person to live with and I wonder whether Greener and Bull can put up with his personality," said an analyst at a French brokerage.</p>
<p>She put a value of 31 billion francs ($5.1 billion) on the wine and spirits business of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.</p>
<p>Based on an earnings multiple of 20, and taking account of LVMH's 14.2 percent stake in Guinness and his 6.2 percent stake in GrandMet, this would give LVMH a stake of 33 to 35 percent in the new group.</p>
<p>Arnault, who has an indirect 20 percent stake in LVMH, would have a seven percent stake in the larger group.</p>
<p>The Arnault plan would only concern the Moet and Hennessy segment of LVMH and not the Louis Vuitton leather goods, Dior perfumes or the newly acquired DFS Duty Free Shoppers chain.</p>
<p>In contrast to the GMG Brands plan, Arnault sees no place in the venture for Guinness's original stout brewing activities and such GrandMet food activities as Burger King, Pillsbury and Haagen Dazs ice cream.</p>
<p>"It would be a pure drinks and spirits group, very transparent, with big brand names and with good distribution synergies," an analyst said.</p>
<p>A source close to LVMH said that when Guinness's Greener in 1994 wanted to exchange his stake in LVMH for a participation in the French group's drinks business he said he wanted to "concentrate on the things we know best".</p>
<p>"That is exactly what Arnault is proposing now but Greener seems to have changed his mind," the source said.</p>
<p>LVMH was establised in 1987 and Arnault became chairman in 1989. At that time the group already had a joint venture with Guinness.</p>
<p>Arnault has no direct stake in LVMH but is the biggest shareholder through a chain of companies -- his family holds nearly 100 percent of Montaigne Participation &amp; Gestion, which has 99 percent of St Financire Agache, which holds 49 percent of St Au Bon March, which has 53 percent of Christian Dior SA which in turn has 41.7 percent of LVMH.</p>
<p>Arnault has a reputation in France as a shrewd deal-maker and LVMH has long been a darling of the stock market although its perfomance recently has become sluggish. But whether he can convince his counterparts of the merits of his plan remains an open question.</p>
<p>"The deal makes good sense but it is no done deal," said one analyst.</p>
<p>LVMH shares closed 0.51 percent higher at 1,579 francs on Tuesday while the blue-chip index ended 0.31 percent higher.</p>
