<p>Finnish foodstuffs, animal feed and chemicals group Raision Tehtaat Oy Ab said on Thursday it would build a second plant to produce stanol esters, they key ingredient for its cholesterol reducing Benecol margarine.</p>
<p>"A second stanol ester factory will be built at Raisio for which planning has already begun. It is expected to be in production by the end of 1997," Raisio said in a statement.</p>
<p>"A total of approximately 150 million markka will have been invested in stanol ester production in 1996-97," it said.  </p>
<p>Added to this were investments in research and development and in marketing, it said.</p>
<p>"By January 1998, esterification capacity is expected to have reached a level of 2,000 tonnes per year," it said.</p>
<p>UPM-Kymmene Oy and Raisio are in negotiations aimed at more extensive exploitation of wood sterols than to date, it said. It added it was in talks with other suppliers. Pine trees are a relatively abundant source of the raw material.</p>
<p>The Finnish wood processing industry has the potential to extract 2,000-3,000 tonnes of plant sterol per year, Raisio said; the worldwide extraction potential is 10 times that.</p>
<p>"In the vegetable oil industry, it would be tens of thousands of tonnes per year," it added.</p>
<p>"The Raisio Group has now expanded its raw material base by including sterols derived from vegetable oils," the company said. "This has led to an immediate increase in the supply of raw material, which will benefit Benecol production during the coming spring."</p>
<p>Raisio said its strategy is to retain control over the actual production of stanol ester while it will be able to produce Benecol margarine and any other stanol ester products for the home market at its own factories.</p>
<p>"In other markets the objective is to move forward through cooperation agreements," it said.</p>
<p>"The criteria will be a large population, sufficient buying power, and widespread health consciousness," it said.</p>
<p>It repeated that it plans to start selling Benecol in Sweden next year.</p>
<p>Actual Benecol products will depend on the eating habits in each country, and potential areas in addition to northern and central Europe include North America and Japan, it added.</p>
<p>Raisio said it was applying for a so-called European Patent for the discovery: "Comprehensive patent protection will thus exist," it said.</p>
<p>Patents have been granted in the United States, Russia, Australia and Poland, and are still pending elsewhere.</p>
<p>"The application process has not been complicated by any negative findings," Raisio said.</p>
