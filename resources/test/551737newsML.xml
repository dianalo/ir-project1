<p>Israeli bonds closed higher across the board on Wednesday with strong demands for most kind of bonds, traders said.</p>
<p>Indices:</p>
<p>* Government bonds general: +0.15 pct to 105.79</p>
<p>* CPI-linked government bonds: +0.19 at 105.88</p>
<p>* Unlinked government bonds (Gilon -- issued for four years): +0.08 pct to 105.71</p>
<p>* Dollar-linked government bonds: +0.11 to 105.45</p>
<p>* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: +0.13 to 104.70</p>
<p>Volume was 129 million shekels.</p>
<p>"The trend is positive. There was surplus demand of 160 million shekels for the CPI-linked bonds, of 70 million shekels for the unlinked bonds and of 495 million shekels for the Makams," said a provident fund investment manager.</p>
<p>"The demand has caused prices to rise and has lowered yields. One can't say trading was boring today. Let's hope the trend continues," she said.</p>
<p>"Among the CPI-linked bonds there is less demand for the floating-rate note than for the fixed-rate notes, because traders believe the yield curve of the fixed-rate notes is on its way down," said Adam Reuter, managing director of Financial Immunities financial consultancy.</p>
<p>Reuter said the interest rate given by the floating-rate note is linked to the yield of the fixed-rate CPI-linked bonds.</p>
<p>"The government is issuing less fixed-rate CPI linked notes and thus prices of the fixed-rate notes are on the way up and the yield curve on the way down," he said. He added that the government was in general issuing less CPI-linked bonds and preferring to issue unlinked bonds.</p>
<p>Demand for unlinked bonds and Makams was up on Wednesday, Reuter said, because many players expected the interest rates to go down in the summer months along with lower consumer price indices. At the same time, some traders still feared a rising inflation and were continuing to buy CPI-linked bonds.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of money in the market," he said.</p>
<p>Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.</p>
