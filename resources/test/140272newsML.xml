<p>A Chinese envoy said on Thursday Hong Kong residents would be consulted over proposed laws governing the future Chinese garrison to be stationed in the territory after the handover.</p>
<p>"I think we will consult Hong Kong through an appropriate process," said Chen Zuo'er, a Chinese representative on the Sino-British Joint Liaision Group (JLG) responsible for the handover of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Chen was speaking after JLG experts began two days of negotiations over an advance party of People's Liberation Army (PLA) officials to be sent to Hong Kong before the handover at midnight on June 30, 1997.</p>
<p>"I want to stress that they (the advance party) will be here to do preparation work and nothing else," Chen told reporters after the JLG meeting.</p>
<p>"Before June 30, 1997, the defence of Hong Kong is the responsibility of the British," he said.</p>
<p>Chen gave no details on numbers or when they would arrive in the British colony.</p>
<p>His British counterpart, Alan Paul, said Britain would need more information about the PLA vanguard before details could be agreed.</p>
<p>The arrival of the PLA is viewed with trepidation in Hong Kong where the images of troops cracking down on the student-led pro-democracy movement in Beijing in June 1989 remains branded in the collective memory.</p>
<p>China on Wednesday proposed a law empowering Hong Kong's courts to try off-duty PLA garrison members accused in criminal cases.</p>
<p>Criminal cases involving troops on duty would remain the province of China's courts, the official Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>e size of its garrison would not exceed that of the British garrison during its peak when it numbered about 10,000 troops.</p>
