<p>Kenya's opposition parties, civic bodies and church groups said on Monday they would hold an "illegal" rally in the coastal resort of Mombasa on Saturday in a campaign to force President Daniel arap Moi to effect minimal constitutional reforms before elections later this year.</p>
<p>Their announcement at a news conference came as hundreds of heavily-armed police patrolled a section of Nairobi after the government blamed street hawkers for weekend rioting. That rioting was sparked by the breaking up by police of a peaceful opposition rally on Saturday called to press for constitutional change.</p>
<p>"We will continue to demonstrate to the president that Kenyans want minimal reforms before the general elections," said lawyer Gibson Kamau Kuria of the coalition National Convention for Constitutional Reform.</p>
<p>"The next meeting will be in Mombasa this weekend. Others will follow in both Nairobi and the provinces," he added. "We believe we can persuade Moi to effect these reforms."</p>
<p>One person was stabbed to death on Saturday after security forces broke up a banned rally called by opposition leaders and church groups demanding constitutional reform. The riot continued on a smaller scale in the run-down outer business district on Sunday.</p>
<p>At least 133 people were arrested during weekend rioting and would be charged with "criminal offences", the government said in a statement on Sunday.</p>
<p>It said 22 policemen and dozens of civilians were injured during the rioting, 61 shops were looted, two cars were burnt and dozens of others stoned.</p>
