<p>The death of elder statesman Peng Zhen removes one of the last revolutionaries from China's political stage, leaving only former president Yang Shangkun as a possible brake on the power of a younger generation.</p>
<p>Peng was dubbed one of China's "eight immortals" -- leaders of China's communist revolution renowned for their longevity and for the influence they wielded long after they had formally retired from office.</p>
<p>His death on Saturday brings the toll so far this year to two. Deng Xiaoping -- the immortal of immortals -- died on February 19, aged 92.</p>
<p>"His death is a boon for President Jiang Zemin," said one political analyst. "This means there is one less senior elder who can have influence over the Communist Party."</p>
<p>China's "immortal" revolutionaries have been revered -- and influential -- among their successors in a country with a tradition of respect for age and a system in which party leaders spend decades amassing powerbases of influence and connections.</p>
<p>Three immortals survive and are certain to try to exert a behind-the-scenes influence on the younger generation of leaders, headed by state president and party chief Jiang, 71, for as long as their health allows them, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Former president and military strongman Yang Shangkun, 89, is the most powerful of the three who have yet to be overtaken by mortality. He looked in sturdy health when he appeared in public to pay his respects at Deng's funeral rites.</p>
<p>Bo Yibo, 88, a conservative former finance minister and firm supporter of Deng's economic reforms, was frail and hobbled with a stick, bent almost double, in the cavalcade of leaders who bid a final farewell to Deng last February.</p>
<p>The last is Song Renqiong, 93, a senior Communist Party stalwart and military man, who was able only to totter past Deng's body as it lay in state in a Beijing hospital.</p>
<p>The latter two are believed now to have declining importance despite their revolutionary credentials, but Yang remains a power to be reckoned with -- as did Peng Zhen.</p>
<p>"When people in the leadership discuss policy, they often invoke the elder leaders who played a crucial role, and in Peng Zhen's case many of the recent allusions have been to village elections because of his role in passing the election law," the diplomat said.</p>
<p>Yang was a close ally of Deng until he was shunted out of the presidency in 1993 after he displayed ambitions to step into Deng's shoes as China's elder statesman.</p>
<p>He has since been virtually banished from Beijing, allowed to return only for the funerals of other immortals. He travels frequently around the rest of China, sometimes on official inspection tours, and was last reported to be in southwestern Sichuan province.</p>
<p>"Yang's bid for backroom power depended really on whether he was still mentally agile after Deng died," said another diplomat. "And that seems to be the case. Now we have to see whether he can exert his influence from the provinces."</p>
<p>His weight with the powerful military, in which he served for decades, also remains unclear.</p>
<p>Yang may still have a rival among China's octagenarian veterans. In China's arcane political system, where who says what and when really matters, Bo Yibo has had a public say in recent years, publishing articles in the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party.</p>
<p>These are the men who helped Chairman Mao Zedong to fight for the communist takeover in 1949, and even President Jiang cannot be seen to ignore their advice, diplomats say.</p>
