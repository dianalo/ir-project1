<p>The Tunisian bourse expects to see new listings and more investors in 1997 as a result of an ongoing privatisation programme and newly introduced computerised dealing system, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>"We expect at least five new privatised companies to join the bourse and global volume to exceed the $626 million registered last year," Abderraouf Boudabous, a bourse official told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Since last October, the Tunis bourse has been putting listed firms on the computerised dealing system in stages, which helped the market improve its performance and liquidity.</p>
<p>The dealing system, which is similar to the Paris bourse system, has increased transparency, Boudabous said.</p>
<p>"The first positive impact of the system was the trading volume on the official market doubled to $66 million in the first two months of the year compared with the same period in 1996," he said.</p>
<p>The 31-share index which dropped 10 percent last year is expected go beyond the line of 500 points soon. It closed at 494.88 points on Friday, a trader said.</p>
<p>"Stakes of foreign investors in the capital of listed firms jumped from 10 percent to 49 percent in 1997," the bourse official said.</p>
<p>A market analyst said tax exoneration and possibility of exporting revenues and gains on capital, were behind the increasing interest of foreign investors in Tunis blue-chip stocks.</p>
<p>Most investors are European, he added.</p>
<p>Tunisian bourse, which has 31 listed companies and dozen mutual funds, expects new enterprises to be listed as the state plans to float some privatised units on the market.</p>
<p>Tunisia plans to privatise some 63 firms and stakes in large companies such as national airline Tunis Air and oil distribution group Societe Nationale de Distribution des Petroles, and maritime firm Compagnie Tunisienne de Navigation by end 1997, a senior official said.</p>
<p>Tunisia's tourism firm Societe de Tourisme et de Congres launched this week an advertisement offering 15.76 percent of its capital to investors at $3.3 million.</p>
<p>"Societe de Tourisme et de Congres is offering 208,000 shares, or 15.76 percent of its capital to local and foreign investors at 17 dinars per share," a spokeswoman at Tunis-based Sofiges stockbroker said.</p>
<p>The offered shares, which belong to the municipality of Tunis, will be ceded on the stock exchange as part of the state policy to withdraw from the competitive sectors, she said.</p>
<p>"Floatation of state-owned stakes on the bourse will bring more paper and liquidity to market...It will undoubtedly attract medium sized enterprises to raise capital on the bourse," a broker said.</p>
<p>According to the bourse figures the market capitalisation, which reached $3.89 billion in 1996, will follow its upward trend as the country's economic indicators show a healthy expectation in 1997, officials said.</p>
