<p>LIFFE robusta coffee futures stayed lower by the close on Thursday in a calmer session as the market took a breather after Wednesday's spike to a nine-month high.</p>
<p>Prices started off lower as expected and continued to remain in the negative territory throughout the day. Even a higher New York open after an overnight rally to 2-1/2-year peak failed to impress London.</p>
<p>Traders noted a fairly even two-way trade in outright and switch deals. The price falls were limited and the market finished with pared losses as it tried to consolidate its recent gains.</p>
<p>By the finish, benchmark May stood $45 lower at $1,735 a tonne after recovering from a low of $1,712.</p>
<p>The contract had touched a nine-month-high of $1,820 on Wednesday, now seen as an upside chart objective, while support is pegged at $1,700.</p>
<p>Volume was a modest 6,212 lots.</p>
<p>New York's May flirted at $2.00 per pound throughout the Thursday morning session after breaching the closely-watched level for the first time since July 1994, when it reflected news of crop-damaging Brazil frost.</p>
<p>"It can't decide to go below or above $2.00," one trader said of the May contract.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, traders and analysts said it was hard to forecast a firm direction in view of the sharp volatility.</p>
<p>"It's difficult to pinpoint where the market could go from here at the moment," said one.</p>
<p>"GNI believe that the market is likely to be close to a top at the moment but as action (on Wednesday) shows, this is not a game to be played for the faint hearted," the brokerage said in a commentary.</p>
<p>Others said the New York-led rally was fundamentally-driven and that the market was not seeing its highest point yet. "I expect it to pause at some stage before moving up further," said a London analyst.</p>
<p>While the tight arabica supply situation showed no signs of easing for the rest of the year, London's well-supplied robusta could come under further pressure from fresh harvest from Indonesia.</p>
<p>But some said talk of a prolonged wet season during the critical pre-harvesting period in Indonesia could limit sales.</p>
<p>Indonesian sellers were rushing to sell their coffee against the May delivery, local traders said. But lack of raw materials meant that not many cargoes could reach Europe in time for grading and delivery by May. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
