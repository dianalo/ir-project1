<headline>Stg/mark softer, but holds above 2.80 in Europe.</headline>

<p>Sterling was softer at midday in Europe, struggling to retain a foothold above 2.80 marks, with the mark bolstered after Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said the central bank was not seeking a further mark weakening.</p>
<p>"The mark has recovered against sterling and, to an extent, the dollar and the European crosses" said Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist at NatWest Markets.</p>
<p>Sterling, which scaled to 4-1/2 year peaks above 2.82 marks earlier this week, lost composure vs the mark after Tietmeyer said its current level on markets reflected fundamentals, but the Bundesbank was not interested in it weakening further.  </p>
<p>"We see that the mark's level on the foreign exchanges all in all mirrors the fundamentals fairly correctly," Tietmeyer said, adding that the central bank was not keen on a further weakening of the mark,</p>
<p>"We are not interested in a weak mark. We continue to be interested in having a strong mark."</p>
<p>At 1031 GMT sterling/mark was trading at 2.8026/36 against 2.8115/25 marks in late Europe on Thursday. Technical analysts said the 2.80-mark level should act as sturdy support.</p>
<p>Against the dollar, however, the mark was a touch firmer at $1.6314/24 against $1.6300/10 in late Europe.  </p>
<p>"Sterling is under pressure against the mark, but we are seeing good bids below 2.80 marks," said a trader at a UK bank.</p>
<p>Sterling/dollar was slightly firmer at midday in Europe, lifted after Eisuke Sakakibara, director-general of Japan's Ministry of Finance International Finance Bureau, on Friday sounded a warning that Japan's era of record low rates may be coming to an end.</p>
<p>Sakakibara, a closely-watched policy maker, also sounded bells when he said currency markets could face a burst of intervention to prop up the yen if Japanese authorities judge it has fallen too far.  </p>
<p>"There is a bit of near-term nervousness after the comments from Tietmeyer, Sakakibara and others," said Stretch, adding that their effect should be short-lived.</p>
<p>An 11.2 percent seasonally-adjusted year/year rise in March M4 had little effect on sterling as it was close to forecasts of 11.4 percent. Traders said the market paid little heed to bank and building society lending, up a seasonally adjusted 4.5 billion sterling, its largest rise since 1991.</p>
<p>While sterling was little moved by the figures, analysts said they add extra fuel to the argument for higher rates.</p>
