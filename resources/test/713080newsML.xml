<p>Six Thai Air Force planes arrived in Bangkok from Cambodia on Tuesday carrying 700 people, mainly Thais and some foreigners who fled fighting in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>The C-130s had flown to Phnom Penh's battered airport at various times earlier on Tuesday to pick up stranded foreigners in the Cambodian capital.</p>
<p>More military planes would fly out later on Tuesday to ferry another 358 American, Dutch, Japanese and Australian nationals from Phnom Penh to Bangkok.</p>
<p>They were among several hundred people who had waited at Phnom Penh's airport on Tuesday to escape the Cambodian capital after three days of fighting and turmoil.</p>
<p>Those who emerged from the first plane to arrive were seen wearing yellow ribbons on their wrists as identification tags.</p>
<p>Immigration officials at Bangkok airport set up special tables to swiftly clear the evacuees.</p>
<p>Americans among the group of evacuees arriving told U.S. embassy officials at the airport that the safety of foreign nationals and U.S. nationals should now be a major cause for concern.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of Americans in Phnom Penh who want to get out. I personally know of other Americans," Cecil Hill, 50, told embassy officials.</p>
<p>"You should be concerned with other U.S. citizens in Cambodia. The information is not flowing as it should. I am very embarrassed to be an American. The Thais were very helpful but we got virtually nothing from the Americans," he added.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to leave Cambodia. I had a major investment there. My students deserved something better," said Hill, who owns an English language school in the capital.</p>
<p>A rapid deterioration of conditions in Phnom Penh over the weekend may have caused breakdowns in the warden system, a personal network set up by the U.S. embassy to contact its nationals, evacuees said.</p>
<p>"I think the Americans tried to contact their citizens through the warden system but there were problems in Phnom Penh and my wife is Thai so I was able to get out," said Michael Sheinkman, 39, another American working for an aid oganisation in Cambodia.</p>
<p>Another American, Steve Heder, 45, a professor in the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, said he had little help from the U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>"I got out completely through the Thai embassy. I think the number of Americans in Phnom Penh was such that a major effort was not necessary. But I can't say that for sure," he said.</p>
<p>"There was room available on the seventh sortie and they made that extra space available to people from other countries," he said.</p>
<p>"I think Hun Sen has a monopoly of power in the centre but he is also more unpopular than he's ever been. I don't think he will be able to keep a lid on the situation without a high degree of caution," said Heder.</p>
