<p>- Former Finance Minister Sigbjoern Johnsen says the centre parties' budget plans could lead to higher unemployment and a cut in welfare. Johnsen says the centre parties' joint budget proposal is an historic overbid and could easily be titled "Everything to everyone all the time".</p>
<p>- Norway has the highest inflation in comparison with its trading partners. Figures for June show year-on-year inflation growth at 2.9 percent. On a harmonised basis Norwegian year-on-year inflation of 2.8 precent in May was higher than the United States, Japan, Denmark, Britain, German, Sweden and Finland, and above the average for all the European Union countries of 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>DAGENS NAERINGSLIV</p>
<p>- State telecommunications company Telenor has a new service -- direct connection from directory enquiries to the requested number. The service costs 3.50 crowns per number. Telenor could earn 200 million crowns this year if everyone calling directory enquiries uses the new service.</p>
<p>- Inflation figures for June were higher than expected by both the Central Bank and the government statistics department. Knut Anton Mork, chief economist at Handelsbanken, says higher consumer prices increases the chances of Norges Bank hiking official interest rates.</p>
<p>- From autumn a selected number of Statoil service stations will offer a shirt washing service. Customers will be able to deliver shirts in the morning and pick then up washed and ironed in the afternoon.</p>
