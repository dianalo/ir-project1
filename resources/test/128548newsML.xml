<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has endorsed Chad's progress in reforming its economy and will release 12 billion CFA francs of funding envisaged as part of the programme, a government statement said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The statement, signed by Finance Minister Bichara Cherif Daoussa, said that half the money would be made available to the impoverished, sprawling African nation from October 31.</p>
<p>The money to be released is the second tranche of an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, agreed as part of a deal signed in September 1995.</p>
<p>President Idriss Deby, who seized power in a French-backed coup in 1990, won a multi-party presidential election in July. Legislative elections are due on December 22 and February 2.</p>
