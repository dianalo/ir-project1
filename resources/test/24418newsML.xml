<title>USA: KCBT wheat ends lower, world production cited.</title>
<headline>KCBT wheat ends lower, world production cited.</headline>
<dateline>KANSAS CITY, Mo. 1996-08-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>KCBT hard red winter wheat futures ended lower amid pressure from the International Grains Council's upwardly revised estimate of 1996 world wheat production, traders said.</p>
<p>On Friday, the IGC pegged wheat production at 563 million tonnes, up from its previous forecast of 560 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Traders also said sagging values in CBOT corn and soybeans spilled over and pressured KCBT wheat.</p>
<p>KCBT wheat had been mostly lower at the midsession, although the nearby September contract had seen a boost from the lack of deliveries posted Friday.</p>
<p>KCBT wheat closed 1-1/4 to six cents per bushel lower, with Sept down 1-1/4 cents at $4.67-1/2. Dec shed 2-1/2 cents to close at $4.68-1/2.</p>
<p>The Kansas City Board of Trade will be closed Monday in observance of the Labor Day holiday. Traders said the imminent long weekend kept volumes mostly light Friday.</p>
<p>General Mills reportedly bull-spread one million Sept/Dec bushels. Refco, Continental and Benson Quinn each bull-spread at least 500,000 Sept/Dec, traders said.</p>
<p>The KCBT estimated Friday's volume at 28.55 million bushels, far less than Thursday's 48.655 million bushels.</p>
