<title>JAPAN: INSTANT VIEW - Japan April industrial production.</title>
<headline>INSTANT VIEW - Japan April industrial production.</headline>

<p>Below are analysts initial reactions to Japan's industrial production data.</p>
<p>The Trade Ministry said April industrial output fell a preliminary 0.4 percent from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis.</p>
<p>RICHARD JERRAM, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ING BARING SECURITIES (JAPAN):</p>
<p>"That's lower than expected, it's very disappointing.</p>
<p>"Obviously people are looking for the numbers coming out tomorrow -- employment, CPI, wages, overtime, housing starts and construction orders. My impression is that the BOJ (Bank of Japan) will wait until the 'tankan' (on June 25) whatever happens, because they can't raise rates based on one month."  </p>
<p>"My impression is that the BOJ is moving in the direction of wanting to raise rates and it probably will within the next six months... But the judgment on whether rates go up is as much a verdict on what they think about the financial system as on the real economy. The perception is that it's not so bad."  </p>
<p>JESPER KOLL, HEAD OF RESEARCH, J.P. MORGAN, TOKYO:</p>
<p>"April basically is slightly down there, it's a little bit worse than expectations, but nevertheless, it's the VAT hike month, so I don't think there is any great concern. May production is going to be up a very healthy 2.7 percent and the June forecast of minus 1.9 percent is probably going to be revised upwards as we move along into the next couple of months," Koll told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>"Very interesting also to see that the inventory build up in the month of April is not excessive. We're basically back to inventory levels we had in February, so it's before the shifting of demand that comes through because of the VAT hike.</p>
<p>"Overall, I think we are seeing the Japanese supply side and Japanese producers adjusting well to the demand shifts that are going on because of the VAT hike. For the third quarter of this year, we are going to go back towards a gradual uptick in industrial production here in Japan."  </p>
<p>"These numbers underscore that we are in a stop and go pattern of the Japanese economy. We do have the impact of the VAT hike that is distorting demand patterns here in Japan, and as a result of that, the industrial production side is actually adjusting to that.</p>
<p>"We are not going to have a straightforward economic recovery in the second quarter. We need to watch the data over the next three or four months to actually understand the underlying demand and supply trend in the Japanese economy. For the markets, the message should be very simple and straightforward -- this number underscores that the Bank of Japan is not going to be in a hurry to hike interest rates in the next three to six months."</p>
<p>MASANOBU TAKAHASHI, DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF RESEARCH, SANYO INVESTMENT RESEARCH:</p>
<p>Asked about the rise in Euroyen futures after the release of the data, Takahashi told Reuters Financial Television: "The movement is more like a technical one. Although a shocking figure for traders, it'll soon subside when the production figures for May and June, and the quarterly numbers come out."</p>
