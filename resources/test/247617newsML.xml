<p>Retail sales growth in Britain slowed in November to its lowest rate of increase for seven months, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Like-for-like retail sales grew 4.9 percent year-on-year in value in November, down from 5.9 percent in October.</p>
<p>"This is the lowest rate of increase recorded since April," the BRC said. "November's slowdown reinforces our consistent view that this is not a 1980s style boom."</p>
<p>The underlying rate of increase in the value of retail sales fell to 5.3 percent in the three months to November from 6.5 percent in the three months to August.  </p>
<p>The BRC said there had been a weaker performance in October in most areas apart from food and drink. Competitive pressures were holding back inflation in retail goods to below the level of retail price inflation.</p>
<p>"Whilst the outlook for Christmas remains reasonable, the slowdown in November sales growth, coupled with falling inflation in retail goods experienced in recent months, combine to show that we are not in boom time conditions," said Andrew Higginson, chairman of the BRC economic affairs committee.</p>
<p>He said retailers had welcomed the neutral budget on November 26 but opposed any further rise in interest rates.</p>
<p>BRC chief economic adviser Andrew Sentance said inflation was falling in the retail sector and it was other areas of consumer spending which were responsible for the recent pickup in inflation generally.</p>
<p>"Consumers may also be growing more cautious in response to the threat of higher interest rates," he added. -- Richard Murphy, London Newsroom 44 171 542 2774</p>
