<p>Irish president Mary Robinson said on Wednesday that she would not seek a second seven-year term of office.</p>
<p>"It has been a difficult decision for me and I have, with great reluctance, decided not to seek a second term in office," Robinson said in a statement.  </p>
<p>"I believe that by the end of this term I will have made my contribution and that the people will give a mandate to a new president with the vision to represent them as we move into the new millennium."</p>
<p>Robinson overcame odds of 1,000-1 in the male-dominated world of Irish politics to win the 1990 presidential election and become the country's first woman head of state.</p>
<p>A lawyer, she injected new vibrancy in the presidency, refusing to follow in the track of earlier incumbents who were rarely seen and never heard.</p>
<p>In her statement, she thanked the people of Ireland for their trust and goodwill during her presidency.</p>
<p>"The unwavering support I have received as President has enabled me to contribute to the development of the office as a resource for all the people, one that is open, inclusive and tolerant."</p>
