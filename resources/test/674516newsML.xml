<p>As Australia grapples with divisive rows over race and immigration, its Asian-born population is rapidly rising, official figures released on Thursday showed.</p>
<p>But while Asian-born Australians now account for 22 percent of the 4.2 million Australians born overseas, they still make up barely five percent of the country's 18 million people, the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures said.</p>
<p>"The Asian-born population has grown rapidly, particularly in the last decade," it said in its 1997 social trends report.</p>
<p>"People from Asian countries represent a growing segment of our population, reflecting our changing links with Europe and Asia."</p>
<p>Australia's immigrants have traditionally come from Britain, Ireland and other European countries.</p>
<p>Britain and Ireland still make up the largest single immigrant community -- 29 percent -- but that figure has fallen from 41 percent in 1976 as the number of Asians arriving swells each year.</p>
<p>In 1981, Asian-born Australians made up just 8.9 percent of all immigrants. No figure was given for 1976.</p>
<p>Australia's conservative Liberal-National government has slashed the annual immigration intake to 68,000 from 83,000 since winning power in March, 1996.</p>
<p>But as Australia battles to bring unemployment below 8.5 percent, there are growing calls for further immigration cuts and an emotional debate about the country's racial mix.</p>
<p>Race row politician Pauline Hanson, who has warned Asians threaten to swamp Australia, wants all immigration halted immediately.</p>
<p>Hanson has warned Asians could make up more than half the country's total population by 2040, although official estimates put that figure at just 7.5 percent.</p>
<p>Polls show strong support for Hanson and her policies, as Australia's government battles to forge a key role for the country in the booming Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>The bureau's latest report showed Asian countries made up four of the top six sources of immigrants in 1991-95.</p>
<p>Britain and Ireland topped the list with 14 percent, followed by New Zealand at 9.1 percent, Hong Kong and Macau (eight percent), Vietnam (7.5 percent), the Philippines (5.1 percent) and India (4.6 percent).</p>
<p>Separate Immigration Department figures show Asians make up about 40 percent of Australia's annual immigration intake.</p>
<p>Australia's overseas-born population increased to 4.2 million, or 23 percent of the total, in 1996 from 2.8 million in 1976, or 20 percent.</p>
