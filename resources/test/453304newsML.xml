<p>Demand for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is expected to grow by about 3.5 percent each year for the next five years, largely due to expanding appetites in the Asian and Middle Eastern markets, Rich Haun of energy consultants Puvin &amp; Gertz said Wednesday.</p>
<p>An increase in supply from several new production and export expansion projects pending in the Gulf of Mexico, Africa and South America should sate that demand growth, Haun said.  </p>
<p>"There is a continued strong outlook for demand especially in developing countries," Haun told the Purvin &amp; Gertz U.S./International LPG Seminar. "There is also a major build-up programmed through 1997/1999 and numerous non-traditional supply projects planned for early 2000s."</p>
<p>The biggest growth in demand is seen in the residential and commercial sectors of Asia and the petrochemical industry of the Middle East. Growth in those areas will help push worldwide demand up from 160 million tonnes in 1995 to about 200 million tonnes in 2000 and to about 230 million in 2005, predicted Haun.  </p>
<p>In the world LPG residential/commerical market, Asian demand is expected to comprise 38 percent of an estimated 115 million tonnes consumed in 2005, up from 29 percent of 1995's 78 million tonne consumption rate.</p>
<p>"Asia is fueling the greatest growth in demand," said Haun, indicating increased economic activity in the region.     LPGs</p>
<p>can be used to heat and light homes and businesses, fuel agricultural equipment and fire stoves. Meanwhile, increased petrochemical activity in the Middle East is expected to rise to 11 percent of the total chemical market in 2005, up from four percent in 1995.  </p>
<p>Chemical demand as a whole worldwide will balloon in the same period by 23 million tonnes to 63 million. Chemical cracking of LPGs -- mainly propane and butane -- will decrease by six percent in North America, but still account in 2005 for 51 percent of the pie, said Haun.</p>
<p>The demand is likely to be met by a number of new projects expected to go onstream in the next three to four years.</p>
<p>Between 1995 and 2000, supply worldwide is expected to grow from 150 million tonnes in 1995 to about 180 million, with most of the growth outside North America and Western Europen.  </p>
<p>In Africa alone supply has an estimated annual growth rate of 7.5 percent for the next 10 years, partly due to nearly-completed production projects in Algeria that will create 2.5 million tonnes of additional LPGs for export.</p>
<p>Latin American supply is expected to grow five percent, with Venezuela coming onstream in 2000 with 1.5 million tonnes of extra LPG for export, said Haun.  </p>
<p>These new projects take on more significance given the continued uncertainty of Middle Eastern exports, particularly from Iraq and Saudi Arabia. "The Middle East is a stagnant if not declining market for export availability," said Haun, citing political tensions in the region.</p>
