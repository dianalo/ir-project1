<p>"There is nothing very stimulating going on in the market. We actually held up pretty well," said one trader.</p>
<p>Dealers did not foresee any major moves ahead of the futures and options expiry next week.</p>

<p>"We are well-supported at the present level," said another.</p>
<p>Oils and chemicals group OMV led the decliners, dropping 1.77 percent to 1,390 schillings.</p>
