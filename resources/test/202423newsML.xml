<p>Hungary's overnight interbank interest rates dropped on Wednesday as the market's liquidity remained high, dealers said.</p>
<p>Overnight rates closed at 22.5 percent, down from Tuesday's finish of 23.125 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said the rates remained high earlier this week as banks filled their reserves on the first two days of the reserve period and before the November 20 tax payment deadline.</p>
<p>Once their reserves were replenished, banks placed money on the overnight market again, dealers added.</p>
