<p>Italian bond futures ended firm after an afternoon of pottering around in a holiday vacuum. The Italian cash market closed at midsession ahead of a three-day weekend, meaning the London market thinned out as well.</p>
<p>On the cash front, the July 2007 Btp ended 19 basis points up at 101.22 and the yield was 6.68 percent with the spread over the 10-year Bund at 101 basis points.</p>
<p>The September Btp future on LIFFE, which going until the normal close, was 22 basis points higher at 135.45.</p>
<p>BTP futures managed to follow Treasuries higher, helped by U.S. industrial production data.  </p>
<p>Dealers said earlier locals had tried to push Btps down around midsession before they then bobbed up. "But there's no one about to do anything," a broker in London said.</p>
<p>The Italian market reopens on Monday, when it will be looking forward to preliminary inflation data for August from 11 sample cities due on Thursday and Friday.</p>
