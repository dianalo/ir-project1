<p>Copper and aluminium are coming up against long-term downtrend channels stretching back two years, said chartist Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge.</p>
<p>Base metals markets have pushed higher in a traditional fashion over the turn of the year, Gifford said in a commentary.</p>
<p>"Now, however, the technical position is becoming crucial," she said.</p>
<p>Weekly charts show downtrends in London Metal Exchange copper and aluminium three months delivery prices beginning in January 1995, with recent highs touching the top end of the wide channels.</p>
<p>"The markets which have enjoyed the strongest rallies are now up against potential resistance from the long term downtrend channel," Gifford said.</p>
<p>"In the case of copper, this has forced a sharp enough reaction that initial support has been breached, triggering stops on our recommended long positions."</p>
<p>Aluminium, however, is so far holding above critical support centred on $1,600.</p>
<p>"Whilst this remains the case, longs should be retained. However, the probabilities favour the majority of the strength having been seen here and if that support were to go, we would recommend standing aside," she added.</p>
<p>Zinc, on the other hand, was looking more healthy.</p>
<p>It had shown strong contra-cyclical tendencies over recent months and, technically having formed a base, has a good excuse to go higher, Gifford said.</p>
