<p>Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) is keeping a close watch over international crude oil price movements and their impact on the country's trade surplus, a ministry official told a news briefing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Crude oil made up 8.9 percent of overall imports last year. It is a big chunk and we are keeping very careful watch over the global crude oil trade and price movements," the official said.</p>
<p>Official trade figures announced earlier showed that Japan's crude oil imports for August rose 53.8 percent from a year earlier, mainly due to an increase in global prices.  </p>
<p>He reiterated the ministry's view that the trade surplus was still on a declining trend, as growth in imports continued to exceed that of exports.</p>
<p>But he also added that the trend may change depending on foreign exchange rates, crude oil prices and global economic conditions.</p>
<p>Overall car exports in August grew 18.3 percent year-on-year, mostly due to slow growth last year, he said.</p>
<p>Although growth in car exports to the United States was capped as Japanese makers switched to local production, good demand in Europe and Asia continued to support car exports.  </p>
<p>Imports of aircraft, which grew 372.2 percent in August from a year ago, contributed to overall growth in imports that month, the official said.</p>
<p>Japan bought three planes, worth more than 10 billion yen each, from the United States, he said. Imports of aircraft from the United States in August grew 437.0 percent from a year ago.</p>
