<p>St George Bank Ltd said on Wednesday it has cut its Great Australia Home Loan by 60 basis points to 6.35 percent following the cut in official rates by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).</p>
<p>St George said it would reduce its standard variable home loan rates by 25 basis points to 6.80 percent.  </p>
<p>St George said it will also reduce its unique 'Loyalty Rate' to 6.55 percent per annum. The 'Loyalty Rate' applies to St. George customers and their immediate families, who have a minimum five year home loan relationship with the bank.</p>
<p>The new rates become effective on August 4, for new borrowers and September 22 for existing customers.</p>
<p>St George's unit, Advance Bank Australia Ltd, has also cut its key business loan rates and mortgage rates.</p>
<p>Advance said in a separate statement it will reduce its introductory home loan rate by 51 basis points to 5.99 percent.  </p>
<p>Advance said the bank's standard variable rate for new and existing owner-occupier and investment home loans will fall by 0.25 percent to 6.80 percent per annum.</p>
<p>This rate will be available from Monday, August 4, for new customers and will be passed on to existing customers on September 22, Advance said.</p>
<p>St George and Advance Bank will pass on the latest fall in official rates in full to its business customers with a 0.50 percent cut in its various business loans, the banks said.</p>
<p>St George spokesman said it did not release the business loan rates as the cut applied to all its business loans, which were too many to list.  </p>
<p>Earlier, Australia's central bank cut official cash rates by 50 basis points to 5.0 percent.</p>
