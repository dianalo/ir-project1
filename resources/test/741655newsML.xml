<p>The man suspected of killing fashion designer Gianni Versace may be evading a U.S. manhunt by posing as a woman.</p>
<p>The only suspect in last week's shooting death of the celebrated Italian, Andrew Cunanan has a history of adroitly using costumes and makeup and may have shaved his body to enhance a disguise as a woman, police said.</p>
<p>"We have plenty of evidence that the suspect Cunanan is quite the chameleon. He is able to use disguises," criminologist Michael Rustigan of San Francisco State University said on Sunday.</p>
<p>"He dressed up in different manners to his rich patrons. He is very excellent at blending in ...," Rustigan said on the CBS programme "Face the Nation."</p>
<p>Investigators, who set up a hotline to solicit leads on the charming suspect with an easy, white-toothed smile, said in a news release that Cunanan may be wearing eyeglasses or contact lenses.</p>
<p>The team is also "exploring the possibility that Andrew Cunanan may be dressing as a female and may have shaved all of his body hair to enhance this appearance," Miami Beach Det. Alfred Boza said in the release.</p>
<p>Police are searching widely but believe that Cunanan, 27, mostly likely remains in south Florida, where he seemingly lived undetected in stylish Miami Beach for as long as two months despite appearing on the FBI's highly publicised Most Wanted listing of criminals at large.</p>
<p>A sandwich shop clerk tipped police Cunanan was in Miami Beach three days before Versace was shot down in front of his beachfront mansion, and a pickup truck owned by a New Jersey man allegedly killed by Cunanan sat for more than a month undetected in a parking garage near Versace's home.</p>
<p>Eight days before Versace's killing on July 15, Cunanan sold at a Miami Beach pawnshop a gold coin stolen from one of his alleged victims and identified himself by his true name, passport, signature and thumbprint. All the information was routinely reported to police, the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>"There's been a number of sightings," Miami Beach police chief Richard Barreto said on CBS television.</p>
<p>"The latest was last night at the Airport Hilton Hotel, which was searched. ... We were unable to locate Mr. Cunanan at this particular location," Barreto said.</p>
<p>Newsweek magazine reported that a Brazilian woman told investigators she had photographs and videotape of Cunanan inside Versace's gated mansion a week ago, two days before the 50-year-old designer was killed after a visit to a newsstand.</p>
<p>An FBI agent was to interview the woman in Sao Paulo, the magazine said.</p>
<p>Police on Saturday ruled out Cunanan as the killer of a Miami doctor two days after Versace's death. Witnesses had described a man resembling Cunanan as fleeing the dead doctor's home, but police arrested a Cuban immigrant, Yosvany Hernandez, 28, in the doctor's killing.</p>
<p>The San Diego Union-Tribune reported on Saturday that Cunanan feared he might have contracted the AIDS virus and had told a counsellor he would "get" whoever may have transmitted it to him.</p>
<p>But Barreto said, "I don't think anyone really knows what's driving Mr. Cunanan at this point and why he has embarked on this trail of terror."</p>
