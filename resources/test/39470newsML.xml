<p>China's recent interest rate cuts will not weaken the yuan against the U.S. dollar, the Business Weekly said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Rapidly rising foreign exchange reserves and Beijing's pledges to keep a tight monetary policy have been supporting the yuan despite the rate cuts, it quoted an official with the Bank of China's Institute of International Finance as saying.</p>
<p>The newspaper did not name the official, but the Bank of China, a state-run commercial bank, has long held a dominant position in foreign exchange trading in China.</p>
<p>The yuan was 8.3059 to one U.S. dollar on Friday, up from 8.3071 on August 23 when the last interest rate cut took effect.</p>
<p>The People's Bank of China, the central bank, in August slashed interest rates on bank deposits by an average 1.5 percentage points and those on loans by an average 1.2 percentage points. That followed an interest rate cut in May.</p>
<p>China's foreign exchange reserves stood at a record $90.8 billion in July, compared with $73.6 billion at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>Falling inflation would also help support the yuan, it said.</p>
<p>Retail price inflation was a year-on-year 5.9 percent in July alone, while inflation stood at 6.9 percent for the first seven months of 1996, according to official data.</p>
