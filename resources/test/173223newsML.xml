<p>Bonds eased slightly as Spain took profit but traders said there was no great selling pressure. The longer end was seen maintaining the near 20 basis point spread with the Spanish 10-year cash market.</p>
<p>"The market is calmly following the trend abroad," said one trader, adding that there were few end-users in the market.</p>
<p>Traders said that despite the sharp recent price gain, there was no interest in selling and prices looked well-supported.  </p>
<p>"Nothing has changed. The hope of (Portugal's) presence in the single currency in 1999 has not faded; the possibility remains of a further cut in rates; there is not much paper; the technical position is not unfavourable," said another trader.</p>
<p>But the buying will only begin again if bond markets abroad start moving, traders said.</p>
