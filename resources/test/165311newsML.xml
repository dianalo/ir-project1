<p>European bourses were weaker on Monday, with London down several points despite a jump in British Telecom shares after the surprise weekend news of its planned $20 billion merger with America's MCI Communications.</p>
<p>On the currency markets, the dollar drifted down towards 113 yen and dealers predicted it would struggle to make any gains ahead of Tuesday's U.S. presidential elections.</p>
<p>BT shares climbed 30p to 381p but the merger plan failed to lift an otherwise cautious London market and by 1130 GMT the blue chip FTSE 100 index was down six points at 3,942.5.</p>
<p>Traders said business was cautious ahead of the U.S. elections and as domestic political worries revived after the death at the weekend of a Conservative MP reduced the ruling party's majority to one.</p>
<p>British UK M0 money supply and official reserves figures made little impact on either government bond or equities markets and with no major companies reporting on Monday, corporate news was thin on the ground.</p>
<p>The FTSE closed last week at its lowest level for a month and dealers said the market remained pre-occupied over further interest rate rises after last week's unanticipated quarter percentage point tightening of monetary policy.</p>
<p>"As well as interest rate worries, there are anxieties about Clinton winning both houses in the U.S. elections and the impact that may have on, for instance, drug stocks in any overhaul of the healthcare system," said one head of trading.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt German shares were half a percent down in floor trading and dealers said the market was catching up with profit-taking during late Friday's electronic dealings. The 30-share DAX index was down 15.73 points at 2,667.52.</p>
<p>In Paris too the mood was negative and French shares started with modest losses, shadowing a downward drift in bond markets. Traders said operators were marking time ahead of the U.S. poll and little action was expected.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the dollar tiptoed lower against the yen during the European morning as nerves were gnawed ahead of the U.S. poll, but activity was minimal and traders said tight ranges were the order of the day.</p>
<p>The re-election of President Bill Clinton was seen as a foregone conclusion, but the market feared the Democrats could wrest control of Congress from the Republicans and loosen trade and fiscal policy.</p>
<p>"The market's cautious ahead of the elections and there are lingering fears the Democrats are going to get a clean sweep -- though I think those fears are overdone," said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International in London.</p>
<p>Trading was further subdued overnight by a Japanese holiday.</p>
<p>Tim Fox, treasury economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said market jitters over the outcome of the U.S. vote meant the immediate risks for the dollar were to the downside.</p>
<p>"Concerns remain that in the event of a Democrat clean sweep protectionist influences will come back to the fore," he said.</p>
<p>Last Friday's comments by former U.S. treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen highlighted that risk, Fox said.</p>
<p>Bentsen told Reuters Financial Television he was comfortable with the dollar's current exchange rate but would prefer not to see dollar/yen rise further. Substantial appreciation from here would put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage, he said.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1130 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 1.5132 marks and 113.20 yen compared with late Friday's 1.5183 marks and 113.40 yen. STOCKS MARKETS AT 1130 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares had fallen 6.0 points to 3,942.5.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index dropped 5.3 to 2,135.21.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt was down 15.73 at 2,667.52.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $378.65 compared with 377.65 at the London close on Friday. Silver was up four cents at $4.82.</p>
