<p>The Dutch finance and transport ministries have requested more time in which to study a possible sell-off of the government's 76 pct stake in Schiphol airport.</p>
<p>A letter sent to parliament by transport minister Annemarie Jorritsma calls for more time to study the terms of any future sell off.</p>
<p>The research is focusing on the airport's pricing policy which would be introduced after privatisation had taken place.</p>
<p>Jorritsma had promised to provide parliament's lower house with an answer on the matter before March 1.</p>
<p>As well as explaining the technical terms under which the airport operating company Amsterdam Airport Schiphol may brought to the market, the more fundamental question regarding privatisation will also soon be debated by the cabinet.</p>
<p>The airport operating company is 22 pct owned by Amsterdam City Council, 2 pct by Rotterdam City Council and the balance held by the Dutch state. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+5017</p>
