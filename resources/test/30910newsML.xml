<p>Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani on Tuesday welcomed U.S. missile strikes against Iraqi military targets, but said they had so far failed to deter tank and artillery movements toward his rebel positions.</p>
<p>"Forty Iraqi tanks, as well as artillery, moved from Qushtapa toward Bustaneh about one hour ago. Their advance has been stopped by the peshmerga (guerrilla) resistance," Talabani told Reuters from his Iraqi Kurdistan stronghold of Sulaymaniya, more than 100 km (60 miles) to the southeast.</p>
<p>He said the Iraqi troop movements came shortly after 25-30 U.S. cruise missiles were launched against military targets in southern Iraq -- approximately 1000 km (600 miles) away from the Kurdish-held north.</p>
<p>Talabani, whose Patriotic Union of Kurdistan was ousted from the Kurdish city of Arbil by Iraqi forces at the weekend, said he expected further U.S. attacks should Baghdad not withdraw from the area at once.</p>
<p>"This is just the hors d'oeuvre of the conflict," he said of the U.S. strike. "This is not the main course.</p>
<p>"We thank President (Bill) Clinton for his brave humanitarian action against the Iraqi leadership in the only langauge (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein understands.</p>
<p>"I sent him a telegram of congratualtions," Talabani said.</p>
