<p>Stocks fell sharply Thursday as the market was hammered by a major selloff in technology shares and residual pressure from Wednesday's cautionary comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials fell 58 points to close unofficially at 6925, more than 100 points shy of where it stood at Tuesday's close. But even the Dow's stiff losses paled in comparison to those on the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite, which slid more than two percent.  </p>
<p>Rising interest rates again posed a problem for stocks. The yield on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury edged up to 6.81 percent, as jitters over Greenspan's blunt comments on interest rates pressed on the bond market.</p>
<p>The heightened sense of caution was felt most intensely in the technology arena, where investors were clearly rethinking the high valuations they had assigned to the sector.</p>
<p>"There is a fundamental valuation change occurring," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. "The communications equipment makers in particular are being revalued, and the valuations are going down."  </p>
<p>The selling pressure on tech stocks, which as a group have performed unimpressively in recent weeks, appeared to reach a flashpoint with news late Wednesday of the mega-merger between networkers U.S. Robotics Corp and 3Com Corp.</p>
<p>Opinions on Wall Street about the merger varied but most telling for the networking group, some analysts said, was the low price that 3Com agreed to pay for U.S. Robotics.</p>
<p>"If anything, this deal is more of a take-under than a takeover," said Salomon Brothers analyst Peter Swartz. "This deal says the days of the 35 to 40 percent premiums paid in previous networking acquisitions are over."  </p>
<p>Shares in 3Com fell four points to 35 and U.S. Robotics fell 1-7/8 to 59-1/8.</p>
<p>Other networking stocks were sharply lower, among them Ascend Communications Inc, off 5-3/8 to 57, Cascade Communications Corp, down 2-1/2 to 30-1/8 and Cisco Systems Inc, off 3-1/16 to 55-1/16.</p>
<p>The negative sentiment quickly spilled into other computer-related groups. Intel Corp tumbled 6-41/64 to 139-47/64 and Microsoft Corp slid 4-1/8 to 96-1/8.</p>
<p>The result was the steepest one-day decline on the Nasdaq Composite since last July.  </p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite fell 27.89 points to 1312.66, the largest decline in point terms since a drop of 32.32 points on July 23.</p>
<p>Despite the more guarded atmosphere on Wall Street, analysts were hesitant to compare the current decline to the July swoon.</p>
<p>"This is healthier than what we would have seen if the market had continued blindly higher," said Peggy Farley, chief executive at Amas Securities. "The market has tended to get a little ahead of itself, and I think we're seeing a reassessment, not a great big correction."  </p>
<p>Among individual issues, Centennial Technologies Inc extended its wild run, plunging 11-1/4 to 3-1/2 after saying restatements to its earnings would show it lost money during the last three years.</p>
<p>The shares have been on a roller-coaster ride since the arrest of Centennial's founder and fired chief executive Emanuel Pinez earlier this month.</p>
<p>Citrix Systems Inc tumbled 15-5/8 to 10-5/8 after the company warned late Wednesday that it could face increased competition from Microsoft Corp.  </p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index fell 10.61 points to 795.07, its first close below 800 since topping that milestone more than two weeks ago.</p>
