<p>A draft European Union treaty contains plans for a common immigration policy and urges Britain to remove controls on borders with the EU, British media reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The BBC said the treaty draft, to be considered at an EU summit next week in Dublin, proposed a common asylum policy throughout the EU and the end of all immigration checks on travellers, whatever their nationality.</p>
<p>These ideas are strongly opposed by the British government which is under pressure from right-wing members of the ruling Conservative party to step aside from further integration in Europe.</p>
<p>The new treaty will replace the Maastricht Treaty signed in 1991. Britain achieved opt-outs from European monetary union and a social chapter covering workers' rights at Maastricht.</p>
<p>The Times newspaper reported that Ireland, current holder of the rotating EU presidency, had not attempted to tackle even more contentious subjects like the extension of majority voting into areas currently subject to a possible veto.</p>
