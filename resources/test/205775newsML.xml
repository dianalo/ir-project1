<p>H&amp;R Block Inc, which reported a fiscal second quarter loss that it said was due primarily to losses at its 80.1 percent owned CompuServe Corp operation, said Thursday it is seeking to restore profitability to the online service provider.</p>
<p>"We've been working closely with CompuServe to assess the business and to develop a plan to restore profitability as quickly as possible," said Frank Salizzoni, H&amp;R Block's president and chief executive officer and CompuServe's chairman, in a statement.  </p>
<p>Earlier today, H&amp;R Block reported its fiscal second quarter loss of $74.1 million or $0.71 a share included its share of losses from CompuServe of $46.5 million or $0.45. H&amp;R Block also said its directors voted to cut the company's quarterly cash dividend payment to $0.20 a share from $0.32.</p>
<p>As part of its plan, CompuServe will shift its marketing strategy to focus on the business and professional market as well as to reduce costs. As part of this strategy, CompuServe will withdraw its family-oriented WOW! online service effective January 31, 1997, causing a $4.9 million after-tax restructuring charge in the current quarter results.  </p>
<p>As in past years, H&amp;R Block's core businesses -- H&amp;R Block Tax Services, H&amp;R Block International and Block Financial -- incurred increasing losses in the second quarter.</p>
<p>H&amp;R Block Tax Services reported a pretax loss of $42.2 million for the second quarter, an increase of $6.9 million from the same period last year, which reflects increased investments in management and office expenses along with goodwill amortization from recent acquisitions.</p>
<p>H&amp;R Block International reported earnings of $600,000 for the quarter, a decline of $300,000 from the results a year ago.  </p>
<p>Block Financial Corp reported a pretax loss of $2.1 million for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $1.5 million for the same period last year, due to marketing expenses and increased credit card bad debt reserves.</p>
<p>"This year's deeper second quarter loss in these core businesses is in large part a result of the company's investments to expand its office network and roll out new products," Salizzoni said.</p>
<p>H&amp;R Block added more than 300 tax offices in the last year. This increased off-season operating expenses, but will also boost tax season revenues, he said.</p>
<p>H&amp;R Block also said it plans to introduce a number of new products for the coming tax season. Tax Services will open about 50 offices which target higher-income clients. A partnership between Tax Services and Block Financial will test a second mortgage program in about 30 offices in four states, and Block Financial is currently in registration for the securitization of its initial mortgage portfolio. In addition, Block Financial signed a 10-year agreement with Beneficial National Bank enabling it to purchase a 40 percent participation interest in Refund Anticipation Loans made to H&amp;R Block clients.</p>
