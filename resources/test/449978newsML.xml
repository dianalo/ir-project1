<p>North Korea's highest-ranking defector began his flight to freedom through China in a Beijing taxi and left five weeks later aboard a special Boeing airliner surrounded by Cold War secrecy and phalanxes of armed guards.</p>
<p>Officials fearing North Korean assassins wanted the life of Hwang Jang-yop, the most senior North Korean to betray his Stalinist homeland, cloaked his clandestine escape in clouds of rumour and a smokescreen of confusion.</p>
<p>It was a plot worthy of the Cold War and involved the two states involved in the last Cold War confrontation on earth -- Stalinist North Korea and the capitalist South. China played the role of unwilling go-between.</p>
<p>The plot started to thicken early on Monday amid rumours that Hwang had left the safety of the South Korean consulate in Beijing on Sunday.</p>
<p>Denials from Seoul officials who said a solution on his departure could still take days turned out to be a ruse.</p>
<p>The late-night Sunday convoy of three minibuses, their windows blackened, appeared to have been a rehearsal for the evacuation the following night of Hwang and his assistant from the heavily guarded South Korean consulate.</p>
<p>At about 8.00 p.m. on Monday, the three buses with their darkened windows drove slowly out from the sedate diplomatic quarter of Beijing, negotiating their route around the armoured personnel carriers, traffic bollards and police carrying assault rifles who had guarded the mission since Hwang slipped in on February 12.</p>
<p>His stealthy departure, and the continued heavy security cordon around the Seoul mission, left observers confused.</p>
<p>Had Hwang been spirited out of his asylum? Or was this yet another ruse to befuddle enraged North Koreans eager to ensure the architect of Pyongyang's ideology of "juche", or strict self-reliance, did not live to tell the tale of his life as 24th in North Korea's hierarchy.</p>
<p>After spending the night at a military airport on the outskirts of Beijing, Hwang boarded a small aircraft early on Tuesday that flew him in a special flight across China -- a rare favour in China that guards its air space fiercely.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers in the bustling southeastern port of Xiamen confirmed the arrival of the special flight but declined to identify its passengers, saying only they were bound for the Philippines.</p>
<p>How and when he left remained cloaked in secrecy. China did not announce his departure until many hours later.</p>
<p>Did he travel aboard a scheduled China Southern Airlines flight to Manila? Or was that rumour a decoy while Hwang flew to the Philippines in a special chartered Boeing 737?</p>
<p>And where did he go after his arrival in the Philippines, this high-profile guest whose political fame was concealed under the disguise of a "foreign investor".</p>
<p>Last week, intelligence officials in Manila were summoned for a closed-door briefing where they were told "a foreign investor is coming", one official who was present told Reuters.</p>
<p>"Only yesterday were we told who the investor is," the official said. An advance party of five security officials from South Korea had arrived in the Philippines last week.</p>
<p>Wherever Hwang goes, security and secrecy will surround him.</p>
<p>Unidentified North Koreans tried to burst into the mission where he was sheltering in Beijing, western diplomats said.</p>
<p>Even after his departure, the armed Chinese guards and armoured personnel carriers were slow to lift their cordon, fearing revenge from the Stalinist North.</p>
<p>"He is a human time-bomb," said one analyst.</p>
