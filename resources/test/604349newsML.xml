<p>FSI International Inc on Thursday its board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan.</p>
<p>Under the plan, the company declared a dividend of one right to buy a preferred share for each outstanding FSI share owned by holders of record on June 10. The rights expire on June 10, 2007.</p>
<p>The company, which makes automated surface conditioning equipment, said the plan was not in response to any current takeover attempt.  </p>
<p>FSI said the plan was adopted to help shareholders realize the long-term value of their investment in the company and to help ensure they receive fair treatment in the event of a takeover attempt.</p>
<p>The rights will generally become exercisable after any person or group acquires 15 percent or more of the company's common stock or announces a tender or exchange offer.</p>
<p>Each right entitles shareholders to buy one-hundredth of a share of a newly created preferred stock at a price of $90, subject to adjustment.</p>
<p>At the option of the board, the company said it may redeem the rights at $0.001 each at any time before a public announcement of a 15 percent acquisition. The rights can also be redeemed for 20 days afterwards, unless there has been a change in board.</p>
<p>FSI manufactures capital equipment for the microelectronics industry.</p>
