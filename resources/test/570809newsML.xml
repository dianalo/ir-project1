<p>Brazil was likely to become the most powerful player in the world sugar market over the next two decades, greatly increasing global market share and lowering world sugar prices, an industry economist said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Given Brazil's potential to eventually supply nearly 20 percent of world sugar consumption, Brazil is likely to emerge as the major force in the world sugar market in the next two decades," Brent Borrell of the Australian Centre for International Economics, said.  </p>
<p>In a speech to the 1997 Australian Sugar Convention, Borrell said Brazil's policy of forcing nearly 60 percent of its sugarcane to produce ethanol fuel for automobiles appeared to be costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars annually.</p>
<p>"This is because the value of the imported oil fuels the ethanol replaces is worth only half what sugarcane would be worth if used to produce sugar," he said.</p>
<p>There was now an increasing awareness of the opportunity costs and outdatedness of Brazil's sugarcane sector policies, he said.  </p>
<p>In the four years to 1996, Brazil had increased sugar production by 60 percent and lifted sugar exports by 220 percent, Borrell said.</p>
<p>"Already the production and sale of ethanol cars is declining sharply and in some cases, cheap imported ethanol is being used as a substitute for ethanol to free up sugarcane for sugar production," he said.</p>
<p>Borrell said a 10 percent productivity increase in Brazil caused a 22 percent increase in its exports and a 2.4 percent decline in the Australian mill door price.  </p>
<p>"However, Australia seems to be insulated from the full impact of Brazil's expansion on the world market," he said.</p>
<p>Looking at other major sugar-producing nations, Borrell said Cuba was no longer the world's biggest sugar exporter and was unlikely ever to return to using about 90 percent of its arable land for sugarcane.</p>
<p>However, Thailand was an efficient sugar exporter with scope to increase productivity and expand international sales, Borell said.</p>
