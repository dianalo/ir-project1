<p>ProNet Inc said Thursday it had entered into an agreement in principle to settle the securities class actions pending against the company in state and federal courts.</p>
<p>The company said it and its insurance carriers will pay the shareholders that are suing it $5 million to settle all the claims.  It will assign to the plaintiffs certain rights against one of its insurers and issue one million shares of stock to the them, it added.  ProNet said it would also pay $2 million to the plaintiffs if it engages in a merger or similar deal within two years that changes control of the company.  </p>
<p>The plaintiffs allege the company, insiders and an investment banker schemed to inflate the price of its stock in order to affect numerous acquisitions.</p>
<p>They filed their suits after the price of the company's stock declined in June 1996.</p>
<p>ProNet provides wireless communication services through its paging and security system operations.  It serves more than 1.3 million subscribers through its five regional SuperCenter locations in New York, Chicago, Houston, Charlotte and Stockton, Calif.</p>
