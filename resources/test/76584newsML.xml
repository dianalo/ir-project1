<p>A team of Chinese experts that was to have visited the United States this week to discuss TCK smut has postponed its visit, said Bob Riemenshneider, head of USDA's grain and feed division.</p>
<p>The team, which was to have examined U.S. measures against the fungus, delayed its visit for logistical reasons, Riemenshneider told USDA radio. They are expected to reschedule within a month, he said.</p>
<p>The official said dialogue was continuing between the two countries on the TCK issue, which has disrupted U.S. wheat exports to China over the last several months.</p>
