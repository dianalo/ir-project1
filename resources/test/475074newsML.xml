<p>The state of Utah approved a permit for Conoco Inc. to drill for oil on a state lease in the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, a Conoco spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Local environmental groups have been trying to stop the company, a unit of DuPont Co., from going into the Reese Canyon area of the national monument, created by President Bill Clinton last year.</p>
<p>"If they proceed, surface activity will be right within the heart of the new monument," said Johanna Wald, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defence Council.</p>
<p>"It will unquestionably harm the wilderness, archaeological and other resources ... the very values the mounment was intended to protect," she said, adding that the red rock canyon one of the most beautiful and wild places in the country.</p>
<p>The company does not know yet when it will begin drilling on the lease, one of several state and federal leases it has held for almost 10 years and which were set to expire this year.</p>
<p>"First we have a lot of planning to complete, and we do not have a date to begin drilling," said spokesman John Bennitt in Conoco's Denver office.</p>
<p>The company estimates that the area could hold more than a hundred million barrels of oil.</p>
<p>Conoco had been considering exploring for oil there for two years before Clinton set the land aside. When he named the monument he said valid existing leases would be honoured.</p>
<p>"We are very pleased that the state of Utah, in issuing the permit, recognised the validity of our lease," Bennitt said.</p>
<p>"We are going to be very careful about working in this area because of its obvious sensitivity," he said.</p>
