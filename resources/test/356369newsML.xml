<p>The Malaysian businessman at the centre of a sensational soccer match-fixing trial has made a heartfelt plea of innocence, saying he never paid players to throw top-level matches.</p>
<p>"I have been waiting for two years to come here and explain my situation. This is the situation. I have not waited all this while to come here and tell some sort of fantasy," Heng Suan Lim told the courtroom in an impassioned outburst on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lim denies he paid former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar and one-time Wimbledon keeper Hans Segers to throw matches on behalf of a Far Eastern betting syndicate.</p>
<p>Instead, he admits he paid the two men for help in forecasting the results of Dutch and English league matches. passing on the information to a wealthy Indonesian gambler.</p>
<p>"Imagine if I suggested to Grobbelaar that he fix matches...probably I would be flying from the window of his penthouse," Lim said. Segers, he added, "would have fainted and not got up again".</p>
<p>Lim and former striker John Fashanu are accused of paying Grobbelaar and Segers to throw matches. All four deny the charges, which carry a maximum seven-year sentence.</p>
<p>Fashanu was expected to be cross-examined at some stage on Thursday. The case, the first of its kind in England for more than 30 years, has attracted intense media interest.</p>
<p>Prosecutor David Calvert Smith suggested it was too much of a coincidence that Lim had been paying goalkeepers, the players most likely to be able to affect the result of a match.</p>
<p>"I would say it is purely coincidence. If I was knowledgeable in Dutch football as well as English football, Mr Segers would not be forecasting for me," said Lim, adding he had paid the Dutchman around 40,000 pounds ($65,000).</p>
<p>Lim said on Tuesday he had paid Grobbelaar a fraction of that amount, whereas the prosecution allege he paid the keeper 40,000 pounds for rigging a single game in late 1993.</p>
<p>The prosecution says Lim, 31, received around 500,000 pounds ($800,000) from various Asian sources which he then used to pay the other members of the alleged match-fixing ring.</p>
<p>Calvert Smith said Lim's only apparent regular source of income was regular contributions from Josef, a wealthy cocoa commodity trader. Lim said his benefactor rewarded him with huge sums of money when his bets paid off.</p>
<p>"Win or lose, he will not moan or show any dissatisfaction -- he bets as a hobby," said Lim, who admitted on Tuesday to losing 175,000 pounds ($280,000) in casinos. Josef stopped paying him when he learned about the losses, he said.</p>
