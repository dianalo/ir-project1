<p>Halifax Building Society, Britain's largest morgage lender, said on Wednesday it had no current plans to raise mortgage rates.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the society said in the wake of a 1/4 point rise in bank base rates to six percent that it would review the situation after the UK budget statement.</p>
<p>But a Halifax spokesman said on Wednesday that the society would now watch market reaction to Tuesday's budget and await any developments at the next monetary meeting between Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George, on December 11.</p>
<p>Nationwide Building Society this month raised its variable rate to 6.74 from 6.49 percent, but the Nationwide rate was below the industry average. Halifax's standard variable mortgage rate currently stands at 6.99 percent.</p>
