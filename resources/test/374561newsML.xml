<p>CSCE coffee futures surged for the sixth straight session Thursday, with new contract highs set for all delivery months out to May 1998 as continued buying by commodity funds extended the market's bull run.</p>
<p>"It is a strong market and it is important to remember it began taking off in early January," said Prudential Securities analyst Arthur Stevenson. "Nothing fresh fundamentally happened today, but basically the market remains focused on the supply situation."</p>
<p>CSCE March coffee ended up 8.20 cents at 180.05 cents a pound, its highest level in 21 months on the weekly chart, after peaking at a new contract high of 181.00 cents. Second-month May rose 5.80 cents to 169.00 cents, while the outer months finished up 4.25 to down 1.05 cents.</p>
<p>March/May switch, a barometer of neat-term availability, ballooned to 11.05 cents compared with 9.55 cents at the close on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Prudentials Stevenson noted a combination of factors have fueled the market's uptrend, which has seen the March contract soar some 50 percent since the start of 1997.</p>
<p>Projections for smaller crops in the two top producers, Brazil and Colombia, sparked supply jitters, he said. So did the Association of Producing Countries' (ACPC) plan to go ahead with export quota cuts in the first half of 1997, and depleted inventories in both producing and consuming countries.</p>
<p>Although a strike by state workers strike in Colombia should have little direct effect on the country's coffee trade, Stevenson said it may have psychological impact.</p>
<p>"The strike is not interfering with the normal flow of coffee," he said, "But I think people are concerned it might expand to other sectors."</p>
<p>Colombian labor leaders restarted talks with government officials Thursday morning in a bid to end the work stoppage, which entered its third day and is being billed as the biggest in 20 years.</p>
<p>Traders await the monthly Green Coffee Association of New York stocks data due next Tuesday, with most operators expecting to see a build up in January because of strong shipments from Brazil during December and a steady flow of Mexican beans into Laredo, Texas.</p>
<p>Turnover reached an estimated 17,628 lots today, little changed from Wednesday's official tally of 17,889 lots. ((--Patricia Avidan, New York Commodity Desk 212 859 1640))</p>
