<p>Leading Asian stock markets fell on Tuesday after Japan's Prime Minister commented on possible Japanese sales of U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>Japan has a huge investment in U.S. Treasuries and heavy sales of those securities would pressure U.S. interest rates and hurt the dollar.</p>
<p>Ryutaro Hashimoto's comments, made in New York overnight, sent U.S. financial markets into a spiral. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 192.25 points, its second-largest point decline in history, to close at 7,604.26.</p>
<p>The dollar dropped to 114.45 yen after opening at 115.35, while U.S. Treasuries declined, leaving the key 30-year bond at a price to yield 6.68 percent versus Friday's close of 6.66 percent.</p>
<p>In Tokyo on Tuesday, the key Nikkei 225-share index was off 124.61 points, or 0.61 percent, at 20,311.53. The dollar eased further and was trading around 114.20 yen, while the 30-year bond was off slightly to yield 6.70 percent.</p>
<p>Hong Kong stocks also weakened, although traders attributed the decline more to fevered selling in red-chip stocks than Wall Street's plunge. They said the market was underpinned by investor confidence in the week before the Hong Kong's handover to China.</p>
<p>China recently issued new guidelines to clamp down on red chips -- companies listed in Hong Kong and backed by mainland entities -- prompting heavy selling.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index fell early to 14,797.11 before recovering to end the morning session down 61.92 points at 14,959.31.</p>
<p>Japanese monetary officials moved quickly to calm the markets on Tuesday. The Ministry of Finance issued a statement saying Hashimoto regretted his intentions had not been accurately conveyed.</p>
<p>Traders said there was confusion in the markets over what Hashimoto did or did not say.</p>
<p>Following a speech at Columbia University, Hashimoto was asked if it is in the long-term interest of Japan to continue accumulating U.S. Treasury securities.</p>
<p>The prime minister responded: "Actually several times in the past, we have been tempted to sell large lots of U.S. Treasuries."</p>
<p>According to a transcript of his remarks, he made a reference to the times when the Japanese considered selling Treasuries, such as during the U.S.-Japan auto disputes, and discussed the management of foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>In closing he said: "I hope the U.S. will engage in efforts and in cooperation to maintain exchange stability so we will not succumb to the temptation to sell off Treasury bills and switch our funds to gold." The price of gold in Tokyo showed little reaction to Hashimoto's remarks.</p>
<p>Takatoshi Kato, Japan's vice-finance minister for international affairs, said in a statement on Monday that Japan would continue to cooperate with the United States to stabilise foreign exchange rates.</p>
<p>The Dow's fall triggered selling of Malaysian stocks, which dropped 12.02 points, or 1.10 percent, to 1,076.96 . "The market was already down and Wall Street's fall pushed it further," one trader said.</p>
<p>In Taiwan, Wall Street inspired local profit-taking and the share index, which had briefly touched a high of 9,014.48, failed to maintain its momentum and ended the day at 8,918.17, down 6.95 points.</p>
<p>After opening slightly higher, Thai stocks also fell victim to profit-taking, falling 5.06 points, or one percent, to 499.4.</p>
<p>Korean stocks were weaker, which traders attributed to a consolidation rather than Hashimoto's remarks. The main stock index was off 1.26 points at 751.79 by midday.</p>
<p>Profit-taking dragged Philippine shares lower but the market recovered slightly, leaving the index up 6.60 points, or 0.23 percent, at 2,815.25.</p>
<p>Singapore's Straits Times Index fell 19.28 points, or 0.95 percent, to 2,015.51 and Australian stocks were down but off the day's lows. The All Ordinaries Index was down 11.4 points, or 0.42 percent, at 2,694.9.</p>
