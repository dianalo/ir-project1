<p>No deaths or serious injuries have resulted from a technical problem with the Ventak AV implantable defibrillator made by the Cardiac Pacemakers Inc unit of Guidant Corp, said a spokeswoman for the unit.</p>
<p>Carol Lindahl, of CPI in Minneapolis, said, "We've had no serious injuries or deaths, at all."</p>
<p>She said about 200 of the devices have been implanted in people since the product was approved for European marketing in November. The Ventak AV is not approved for U.S. marketing.</p>
<p>Reprogramming will fix some of the devices, although some replacement surgeries may be needed, Lindahl said.  </p>
<p>Guidant, based in Indianapolis, said Monday it ordered a halt to international shipments of the Ventak AV, a device implanted in the chest or abdomen and connected to the heart by wires to keep it from beating too fast.</p>
<p>Most of the roughly 200 implants done in Europe were in Germany, Lindahl said.</p>
<p>The company said some Ventak AVs have experienced an abnormal increase in pacing impedance and pacing threshold.</p>
<p>Shares in the company were off 3/4 to 55 Monday.</p>
