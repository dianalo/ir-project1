<p>The yield on Spanish six month Treasury bills at Tuesday's auction is expected to be little changed from the previous 5.551 percent rate, dealers said on Monday.</p>
<p>In any case, the yield will likely be set within the range of 5.55 and 5.60 percent, in line with grey market rates and with the auction exciting little investor interest.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow's auction won't provoke much interest and I think it's pretty clear that the Treasury hasn't room to cut the yield, as we saw at last week's one-year auction, despite the (25 basis point) cut in the Bank of Spain's key money rate," said one dealer.</p>
<p>"We could see the yield at 5.55 to 5.60 percent, without a great deal of demand," said a second dealer.</p>
<p>Yields on Treasury bills bottomed in February, coinciding with peseta exchange rate tension.</p>
<p>Although February inflation fell to a fresh low of 2.5 percent year-on-year, allowing a rate cut at the following Bank of Spain repo auction, peseta tension and reduced prospects for further rate cuts in the future mean that lower T-bill and interbank rates are more difficult, dealers said.</p>
