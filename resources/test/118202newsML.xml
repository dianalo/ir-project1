<p>Finnish oil and energy group Neste Oy said on Tuesday it had bought the minority stakes in its Estonian subsidiaries Traffic Service and Estonian Transoil from its Estonian partner, state-owned Eesti Kutus.</p>
<p>Eesti Kutus owned 40 percent of Traffic Service and 45 percent of Estonian Transoil, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>It did not disclose the price.</p>
<p>"This was a natural development," a Neste spokesman said, adding that the joint ownership was set up before it became possible for foreigners to enter Estonian markets directly. "We now agreed to go our own ways ... this was not anything dramatic," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Neste said Traffic Service's 11 petrol stations now operated under Neste's brand and that Neste now has a network of 21 stations in Estonia which have a market share of about 10 percent.</p>
