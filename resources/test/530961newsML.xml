<headline>U.S. debt futures edge off into 5-year auction.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-23</dateline>

<p>U.S. debt futures erased small opening gains and edged off to barely mixed levels in early pre-auction trading.</p>
<p>After Tuesday's afternoon advance, which was spurred partly by a warm reception for the two-year note auction, traders turned attention to Wednesday's sale of $12.5 billion in five-year notes.</p>
<p>Some brokers said they thought the five-year might draw decent demand simply on the coattails of the good two-year sale.  But others warned that any further price rises heading into the bidding could dampen demand for the five-year issue.  </p>
<p>"I think it's a bad idea for the market to rally into a five-year," said one Treasury bond futures floor broker. "I don't think the five-year will go well."</p>
<p>But just after the bell, futures began edging lower from their overnight extension upward, although other brokers said it was too soon for an auction-related price markdown.</p>
<p>"It's a little early for concession-time," said another T-bond futures floor broker. "Open interest was up 16,000, so I think it's just (long) profittaking from 108-07/32 on down."</p>
<p>Preliminary exchange data showed T-bond open interest on Tuesday's price rise increased 16,056 in all months combined.  </p>
<p>Futures also kept a bid overnight on rumors that emerged early Tuesday about the possibility of a U.S. balanced budget agreement.  But no fresh news emerged since late Tuesday, when an Office of Budget and Management spokesman said President Clinton will meet House and Senate budget committee Democrats Wednesday and Thursday to discuss efforts for an agreement.</p>
<p>Some brokers pooh-poohed the notion that politicians and legislators ever would balance the budget and said a price rise based on balanced-budget optimism was ill-founded.</p>
<p>"Not in my lifetime," said the first floor broker. "We went through this last year...I think it's ridiculous."  </p>
<p>With no U.S. economic data due out Wednesday, traders said they would keep watch on speeches by three different Federal Reserve Bank presidents - Chicago, Richmond and Atlanta.</p>
<p>All three presidents are voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee this year.</p>
<p>Overnight comments by Richmond Fed president Alfred Broaddus, who said the current U.S. economy looks "pretty good," had muted effect.</p>
<p>"He's been very hawkish," added the second floor broker.</p>
<p>Technically, brokers said June T-bonds could have more upside after piercing stiff resistance at 108-06/32 overnight.  </p>
<p>The contract rose overnight to a high of 108-11/32 but slipped back below the 108-06/32 level in early pit trade.</p>
<p>At 0835 CDT/1335 GMT, June T-bonds lost 2/32 to 108-02/32, 10-year notes dipped 1/32 to 106-01/32, muni-bonds eased 1/32 to 112-30/32, June T-bills were flat at 94.590, and September Eurodollars lost 0.005 basis point to 93.755. ((DerivativesDesk(312)408-8750)) E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com</p>
