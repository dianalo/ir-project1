<p>Turkey's industrial and financial Toprak Holding will offer partial shares in three of its group companies in leasing, factoring and insurance sectors to the public, a senior company official said.</p>
<p>"The public offering of Toprak Leasing, Toprak Factoring and Toprak Sigorta (insurance) will cover 25 percent of their shares," Zafer Ataman, general manager of the three companies, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Brokerage firm Global Securities will act as the lead manager of the initial public offering.</p>
<p>Toprak Leasing will be the first of the three to go public within one or two months. The company, established in 1994, has a 1.3 trillion lira capital.</p>
<p>Ataman said the target was to increase the total turnover of Toprak Leasing to seven trillion lira in 1997 from 2.9 trillion in 1996. Its 1996 profits were 295.5 billion lira.</p>
<p>Toprak Factoring, established in 1995, also has a capital of 1.3 trillion lira.</p>
<p>"Toprak Factoring's total turnover was seven trillion lira in 1996 and we aim to increase it to 30 to 32 trillion lira in 1997," Ataman said.</p>
<p>Toprak Factoring reported 418 billion lira of profit last year. Ataman said its profits were 500 billion lira in the first five months of this year.</p>
<p>"When we meet our 1997 targets, Toprak Factoring's market share will rise to six-seven percent," he said.</p>
<p>The third company to float shares is the insurer Toprak Sigorta, established in 1996 with 200 billion lira capital which was raised to 360 billion lira in early 1997.</p>
<p>The company collected 360 billion of premiums in the second half of 1996. Its 1996 profit was 144 billion lira.</p>
<p>"Our premium production so far in 1997 is 1.8 trillion lira and our target is to increase it to 2.2 trillion lira," Ataman said.</p>
<p>Ataman did not give further details on the initial public offerings.</p>
<p>Details will be announced after approval for the offers are secured from the regulatory Capital Markets Board (SPK).</p>
