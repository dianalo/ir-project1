<p>Tokyo corn futures closed lower in all months on Thursday, as technical selling by local investors erased earlier price gains, traders said.</p>
<p>Prices were 10 to 150 yen lower, with benchmark November down 140 yen at 14,290 yen per tonne. Volume was 46,450 lots.</p>
<p>Buying from local investors, encouraged by the firmer tone of the Chicago corn market overnight and the weaker yen against the dollar, supported the market during the morning, the traders said.</p>
<p>But by early afternoon, technical selling had erased earlier price gains, they said.</p>
<p>The spot December contract on the CBOT Project A trading system was being traded at $2.82-1/2 per bushel at 0745 GMT, against $2.82-3/4 at Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>The spot November CBOT soybean futures contract was at $6.99-1/2 at 0745 GMT, against $6.98-1/2 at Wednesday's close.</p>
