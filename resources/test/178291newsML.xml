<p>Fifty-six percent of companies support the principle of the UK participating in European economic and monetary union (EMU), while 30 percent are opposed, the CBI said in a statement released at the start of its annual conference on Sunday.</p>
<p>Asked what decisions Britain should make now on EMU participation, 28 percent of companies polled favoured a clear commmitment to entry in 1999. A further 17 percent were in favour of joining, either in 1999 or later.</p>
<p>Sixteen percent were against membership in 1999, but wanted to keep open the option of membership at a later stage. Seven percent said the wanted the UK to reject EMU membership.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted by market research company MORI on behalf of the CBI and the British Chambers of Commerce. Out of a total of 5,000 firms contacted, 1,691 replied.</p>
