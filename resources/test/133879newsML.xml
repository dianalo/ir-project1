<headline>OPTIONS - FX volatilities firmer, eyes on sterling.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-10-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Implied volatilities for dollar-pair options were generally firmer, particularly cable options as sterling rose to a 14-month high, within a whisker of $1.6000, dealers said.</p>
<p>"It looks pretty one-way," said Ted Voorhees, a senior trader at Deutsche Bank in New York. "I don't see any reason why that should change in the near term. It's one of the few nice runs in this market right now."</p>
<p>Sterling has been on a steep uptrend since breaking out above the $1.57-level at the start of the month after a period of range-trading.  </p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the pound was boosted by a comment from a major British employers' group that the currency's strength had yet to harm British exporters.</p>
<p>Cable implied volatilities were well bid across the maturity curve, with one-month quoted at 5.6/5.9 percent, up a quarter point from late Monday levels.</p>
<p>Risk reversals, which reflect pricing differential between puts and calls, were skewed towards sterling calls, with one-month 25-delta assessed at 0.2/0.5 percent.</p>
<p>A U.S. bank trader said volatilities for sterling crosses were also firm.  </p>
<p>One-month sterling/mark volatility was up a few tenths of a point to 6.3/6.6 percent.</p>
<p>"Sterling seems to be the flavor of the week," the U.S. bank trader said. He added that profit-taking would inevitably emerge soon but he expected sterling calls to stay bid over puts.</p>
<p>Implied volatilities were little changed in other major currency pairs as the spot dollar stayed within recent ranges.</p>
<p>Still, dollar/yen volatilities remained edgy as the dollar hovered just below its Monday high of 112.91 yen.  </p>
<p>One-month dollar/yen volatility stood at 6.8/6.9 percent, unchanged from late Monday levels but up from lows earlier in the day.</p>
<p>One-month 25-delta risk reversal was around par, while shorter-dated risk reversals slanted somewhat toward yen puts and longer-dated ones toward yen calls.</p>
<p>Traders said dollar/yen volatilities, during a dollar uptrend, tended to be vulnerable to a pause in the dollar's advance. But they noted that if the dollar kept rising, a huge amount of low-delta yen puts traded recently would start becoming more influential, forcing short-covering in options.  </p>
<p>One-month dollar/mark volatility stood at 6.75/6.95 percent, off early lows and marginally above late Monday levels. One-month risk reversal flipped slightly toward mark calls as concerns grew about a correction to the dollar's recent gains.</p>
<p>Voorhees said dollar/mark has recently been dictated by mark crosses and lacked energy. He expected the volatility curve to steepen as traders were likely to sell the front end to offset time-decay of their portfolios.</p>
