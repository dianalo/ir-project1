<p>NOTE:  Ogden Corp said its average shares outstanding were 49,818,000 and 49,546,000 for the first quarters of 1997 and 1996, respectively.</p>
<p>The company said total revenues were $427.1 million for the first quarter of 1997, down from $520.7 million for the same period a year ago, primarily due to businesses sold.</p>
<p>The company said that higher net income for the first quarter of 1997 was the result of improved operating performance, particularly from the Macau joint venture, coupled with gains from the sales of certain locations.  These positives were offset in part by severance and other related costs incurred during the period.  The company did not disclose the amounts of the gains or the severance costs.</p>
