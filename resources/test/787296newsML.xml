<p>Romanian monthly inflation eased to a record low of 0.7 percent last month from June's 2.3 percent, lower than a previous forecast of between one to 1.5 percent, the National Statistics Board (CNS) said on Friday.</p>
<p>It said year-on-year inflation went down to 159.8 percent in July from 177.4 percent. Consumer prices rose by 102.6 percent from December 1996.</p>
<p>July's figure was the lowest since October 1990, when prices were first freed in Romania after the 1989 fall of communism.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea said on Thursday monthly inflation would probably stand at between one to two percent until end-1997, down from previous forecasts of two to three percent.</p>
<p>Officials also revised up the 1997 year-on-year inflation to about 130 percent from a previous estimate of 90 percent. The revision followed higher than expected prices rises in February and March when the centrist coalition government liberalised prices of fuel, energy and staples.</p>
