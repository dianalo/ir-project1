<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Slumping Panamax freight rates dragged the BFI down by its largest margin this year, 31 points to 1361, to equal the lowest index figure seen since January 30.</p>
<p>Caper and Handy-size rates remained barely steady and there was a widespread lack of optimism for prospects in the summer for all categories. The Baltic Handy index managed a minimal improvement of 2 points to 1099 on the strength of firm levels for craned tonnage from the Continent to the Far East, but significantly the trial grain routes US Gulf/Continent and Brazil/Continent not included in the Handy index both fell from $15.50 to 15.31 and $18.75 to 18.56 respectively.</p>
<p>GRAIN</p>
<p>Although the Zennoh berth is expected to be out of action until June/July, the Mississippi is reported to be expected to return to normal levels by early May. a high volume of fixing of vessels ready to load in the river first half May has been seen but rates have still continued to decline. Three US Gulf/Japan fixtures of 54,000 heavy grain were reported for first half May at $22.00 no combo to Halla, Dreyfus and Hanjin, down another 50 cents from Wednesday's level.</p>
<p>It was rumoured Halla were trying to relet their position at $21.00. Transatlantic rates were also grim for owners with Toepfer fixing 59,000 heavy grain St Lawrence/Ghent-Hamburg range at a very weak $8.50 for end April/early May. from E Coast S America Dreyfus were said to be close to fixing Panamax tonnage Plate/Taiwan at an economical rate close to $23.00. In the Pacific grain rates were falling just as rapidly. Continental booked Pan Ocean tonnage (possibly Samjohn Captain) for 54,000 heavy grain Nopac/Taiwan for end April at only $13.00 and Halla took a Yukong vessel (possibly Camarina) for 54,000 heavy grain Nopac/Japan also for end April at $13.25 no combo.</p>
<p>Handy-size activity in grain was limited. Sea Muse 36,000 was linked with Gesuri Lloyd for a heavy grain cargo Plate/Iran at close to $30.00, and Glencore booked 25,000 heavy grain Rio Grande/Malaysia for early May at a weak $33.00. Italgrani were said to have fixed Cleanthes for 25,000 grains Plate/Libya $26.50. New business quoted included Toepfer for a Panamax US Gulf/Holland for 1/10 May, Bunge up to 5m cft grains Mississippi/Holland for 25 April/5 May (2 Panamaxes possibly workable instead), Finagrain 50,000 51' Sao Francisco do Sul and Rio Grande/1-2 ports Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand, and Andre 25,000 wheat Guaymas/Casablanca 2/9 May.</p>
<p>MINERALS Etc</p>
<p>Caper markets produced few fixtures. Rohstoffhandel booked Cattleya Star for 150,000/10 ironore Tubarao/Rotterdam for 15/30 May at a fairly steady $5.65, but Kleimar were reported to have taken Marshal-class tonnage for 110,000/10 ironore Nouadhibou/Antwerp for April/May at a weak level about $4.05/15 although some reports put the rate as high as $4.50. Cobam were said to have covered about 150,000 tonnes ironore Ponta do Ubu/Rotterdam for 15/30 May but full details were lacking.</p>
<p>Panamax rates generally continued to slide in the East. a couple of modern types were taken for Australian rounds by Japanese charterers at a fairly steady 11,500 daily, but Nordmax 72,500 dwt went to HMM delivery spot Shanghai for a trip via Dalrymple Bay to Hongkong at only $10,500 daily. Similar tonnage was said to be indicating close to $10,000 daily plus $150,000 bonus for delivery Nopac trip Far East. Lleonardo Llembo 75,200 dwt was reported fixed by HMM delivery Japan end April for a coal trip via Queensland to Sweden at between $7,000 and 8,000 daily but some brokers believed the business had failed.</p>
