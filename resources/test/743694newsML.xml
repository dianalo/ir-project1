<p>Just over half of all Britons tend to oppose a single European currency, according to an opinion poll published on Monday.</p>
<p>The Gallup poll conducted for the European Movement, a pro-European Union pressure group, showed 52 percent of those questioned tended to oppose the idea, while 41 percent tended to support it.</p>
<p>But it showed that two-thirds of the sample were open to persuasion about the advantages and disadvantages of British participation in EMU in 1999.</p>
<p>"The poll blows the single currency debate wide open," said Labour MP Giles Radice, the chairman of the European Movement.</p>
<p>"Many people will be surprised that three-quarters of the British people are either open to persuasion that Britain should join the single currency or are already in favour."</p>
<p>The poll showed that only 22 percent of Britons now think Britain should rule out joining EMU in the first wave, down from 36 percent in a similar poll conducted in August last year.</p>
