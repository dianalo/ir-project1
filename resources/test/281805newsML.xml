<text>
<p>Banyan Mortgage Investment Fund on Monday said its stockholders approved a proposal to merge with RGI U.S. Holdings Inc.</p>
<p>The results were based on preliminary voting that ended Monday at 1500 CST/2100 GMT.</p>
<p>It said 25.3 million shares, representing 78.2 percent of the votes cast, were in favor of the proposal.</p>
<p>In addition, 77 percent of the votes cast favored a proposal to amend Banyan's certificate of incorporation to convert every 25 outstanding shares of the company's common stock into one share.  </p>
<p>Banyan also said an amended complaint was filed last week in Delaware against its directors, charging that the board failed to provide the company's public shareholders with information material to their vote on the merger.</p>
<p>It said the complaint asks the Delaware Chancery Court for an order to enjoin or rescind a merger with RGI.</p>
