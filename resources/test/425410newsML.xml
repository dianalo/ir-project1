<p>Nintendo Co Ltd plans to cut the U.S. price of its 64-bit video game machine "Nintendo 64" to about $150 from $199 currently, a Japanese daily reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Mainichi Shimbun said that the move was aimed to counter rival Sony Corp, which announced earlier this week that it had cut the U.S. price of of its unit Sony Computer Entertainment Inc's 32-bit Playstation by 25 percent to $149.</p>
<p>A Nintendo official told Reuters that its U.S. unit was responsible for Nintendo's game machine business in the United States and he could not comment on prices.  </p>
<p>But the Nintendo spokesman added: "Our president has said that we would like to offer products of the best quality at the lowest possible price."</p>
<p>Nintendo announced last month that it would cut the domestic price of the Nintendo 64 to 16,800 yen from 25,000 yen on March 14.</p>
