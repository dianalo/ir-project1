<p>U.S. credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) paid tribute to Sweden's cautious housekeeping on Friday, raising its outlook for the country's foreign currency rating to stable from negative.</p>
<p>The announcement injected a note of optimism into the bond market with the benchmark ten year bond yields falling five basis points to 7.15 percent and the crown firming to 4.46 to the mark from 4.48.</p>
<p>Economists said the brighter outlook was good news for Sweden and warranted on the country's fiscal fundamentals.</p>
<p>"While the Swedish economy has been highly volatile in the past, signficant efforts have been made to improve fundamentals and I think that has been rewarded," said economist James McKay from PaineWebber.</p>
<p>S&amp;P affirmed the Kingdom of Sweden's longterm foreign currency rating at AA+ while lifting its outlook.</p>
<p>"The change...reflects the improvement in the government's fiscal and balance of payments flexibility as the general government deficit continues to narrow and the high governmental debt burden edges down," S&amp;P said in a statement.</p>
<p>Sweden is on track for a balanced budget in 1998 and the general government deficit is expected to decline to 2.1 percent of Gross Domestic Product in 1997 from 2.5 percent in 1996 and double-digit rates in 1993 and 1994.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said a future upgrade or even a shift to a positive outlook relied on substantial progress in lowering Sweden's fiscal debt burden, which is at the high end of the range for AA rated sovereigns.</p>
<p>Sweden's general government debt burden is estimated at 90 percent of GDP in 1997 on a gross basis and its external debt at just under 60 percent of exports this year.</p>
<p>The agency affirmed its stable outlook for the local currency and affirmed the long-term local currency credit rating at AAA and short-term debt ratings at A-1+.</p>
<p>"The higher local currency rating reflects the government's success in fiscal consolidation, its flexibility in taxing and influence over monetary matters and its commitment to and success in achieving low inflation," S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>Economist Katharina Hoyland from JP Morgan said the brighter outlook was not unexpected as Sweden's ratings had lagged its economic performance for some time.</p>
<p>"Sweden is definitely one of the countries that has moved in the right direction over the past two years and that has not been fully acknowledged in its standing in the ratings," Hoyland told Reuters.</p>
<p>She said it could help Prime Minister Goran Persson's minority Social Democratic goverment, whose popularity has slumped in the polls this year to 26.5 percent against the conversative Moderates party rating of around 34 percent.</p>
<p>"It could help Persson's standing but it will take more than this to turn around the polls," Hoyland said.</p>
<p>Unemployment, running at 8.4 percent in March which is high by Swedish standards, has weighed down the Social Democrats and is seen as one of the key issues to be addressed ahead of the next general election in September 1998.</p>
<p>S&amp;P on Friday also affirmed the ratings and revised the foreign currency outlooks for for the City of Stockholm, Swedish Export Credit Corp, the municipality of Taby and Venantius AB to stable from negative.</p>
<p>All foreign currency ratings were affirmed at AA+. Local currency ratings and outlooks were unaffected.</p>
