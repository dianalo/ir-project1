<p>German shares ended bourse trade at a record closing high on Friday after catching up with the rally that occurred post-bourse Thursday following U.S. data that calmed market fears of a U.S. interest rate increase.</p>
<p>The DAX-30 index of leading German shares ended at 2,933.39 points, up 40.76 points or 1.41 point higher. The previous year high was 2,914.61 points on December 5 last year.</p>
<p>The record close reflected the surge in stocks on the Dow Jones index overnight, which closed up 1.16 percent at 6,625.67 points and represented a strong recovery from pre-bourse electronic trade, when the IBIS DAX index fell after Japan's Nikkei-225 share index fell 4.3 percent.</p>
<p>The DAX index ended comfortably above the psychologically-important 2,900-point level and the strong dollar at 1.5785 marks was seen as supporting share values. Investor focus afterwards centred on U.S. jobs data due 1330 GMT.</p>
<p>The close at 2,933.39 points put the DAX within sight of the magic 3,000-point level.</p>
<p>The main share in the news was the carmaker Volkswagen AG, which ended up 21.50 marks at 712 marks in mid-bourse trade after it announced it had reached a settlement with General Motors in the long-running legal dispute between the two.</p>
<p>Another German carmaker, BMW AG, ended up 25 marks at 1,078 marks on positive expectations on the group's earnings in 1996.</p>
