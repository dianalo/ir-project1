<p>The judge in the first class action suit expected to go to trial against the tobacco industry said Friday he wants the case to begin in the spring despite cigarette makers' efforts to delay it until 1998.</p>
<p>Judge Robert Kaye of Miami's Dade County Court said he wants the case brought by airline flight attendants alleging injury from second-hand smoke to begin in April or May.</p>
<p>"If we set a deadline, everyone can work to it. If we leave it open, everyone just sits around," Kaye said. He did not, however, set a definite date.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' lawyer Stanely Rosenblatt had asked for a spring trial date but lawyers representing the cigaratte companies said they needed more time to prepare.</p>
<p>"It is a large and complex case with multiple parties and multiple issues," said Hugh Whiting, who represents R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.</p>
<p>The 1991 lawsuit, known as Broin v. Philip Morris Cos. Inc., was filed on behalf of all flight attendants claiming injury from inhaling passengers' smoke. The number of flight attendants affected by smoke could be as high as 60,000, Rosenblatt has estimated.</p>
<p>Durin g Friday's hearing, Kaye said he would issue an order on Wednesday directing all major airlines to supply Rosenblatt with the names of current and former flight attendants so they could be notified about the trial and determine if they wish to participate.</p>
<p>Rosenblatt said that only Northwest Airlines had supplied a list. The Northwest list contains 103,000 names. He said if the other airlines cooperate, there could be as many as 300,000 names, however, not all would have claims against the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>Because the tobacco industry has exhausted all appeals aimed at stopping the flight attendants' suit, it is expected to be the first class action to go to trial against tobacco companies alleging health injuries linked to cigarettes.</p>
<p>The largest class action against ever filed against the tobacco industry, known as Castano v. The American Tobacco Co., was thrown out by a New Orleans federal appeals court in May. The court found that the case, which was brought on behalf of all smokers alleging injury from cigarettes, would have been too cumbersome if brought to trial.</p>
