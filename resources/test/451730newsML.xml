<text>
<p>The Philippine Central Bank on Tuesday trimmed its borrowing rate on the one-year special series Treasury bill rates to 10.40 from 10.70 percent.</p>
<p>Traders said the adjustment in rates was in line with the slide in Treasury bill rates in Monday's auction.</p>
<p>A dearth of investment instruments and low inflation have led to a softening in interest rates, they said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank, however, left its overnight borrowing and lending rates at 10.0 and 12.75 percent respectively.</p>
