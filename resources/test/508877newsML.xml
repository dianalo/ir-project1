<p>President Boris Yeltsin tugged at Russians' nationalist heartstrings on Tuesday, appealing to his fellow citizens to buy Russian goods.</p>
<p>"Is Russian chocolate worse than imported chocolate? No, it's better," he said in a nationwide radio address. "And bread, sausage, dairy products and beer. Not to mention vodka! These goods are in no way inferior to imports and are often superior."</p>
<p>Yeltsin's appeal, part of a broadside intended to create jobs, help factories and propel the economy back to growth, is targeted at the brightly-packaged imported goods which fill once-bare shop shelves across Russia.</p>
<p>They have crowded out drab domestic products in the five years since the Soviet Union fell apart and given Russians their first taste of goods advertised around the world.</p>
<p>A bitter local joke says Russian children, asked to name the planets, reply: "Earth, Venus, Mars and Snickers", a reference to U.S. chocolate bars.</p>
<p>"When we buy domestic goods, we help our country, our Russian industry, we help ourselves. This is the sort of patriotism I like," Yeltsin, 66, said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's communist opponents in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, gave the president their cautious support, but members of the pro-government party and the liberal opposition were not so sure.</p>
<p>"Domestic producers should be protected by changing the tax system and the budget and fighting corruption -- which means doing the things that Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) is not doing," said Sergei Ivanenko of the liberal Yabloko group.</p>
<p>"In civilised countries such appeals work, but in our conditions it can have the opposite effect. We have a different attitude to the government and have the instinct of doing precisely the opposite to what it recommends."</p>
<p>Pavel Bunich, from the pro-government Our Home is Russia bloc, said Yeltsin's appeal should be accompanied by higher customs duties -- something the president himself ruled out.</p>
<p>"The president is trying to influence people," he said. "There is no doubt where he saw the example -- they tell us that Americans prefer U.S.-made cars. That's true, I would also prefer a U.S. model."</p>
<p>But communist Valentin Varennikov praised Yeltsin. "I have to admit that this time the president is playing on the people's side and doing the right thing," he said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has already issued a decree ordering officials to auction off the sleek imported cars now lining up in ministerial car parks in Moscow and replace them with domestic models.</p>
<p>"Soon bureaucrats will only drive Russian cars," he said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said his "Buy Russian" campaign would help the economy, which officials say is on the point of growing again after seven years of severe recession.</p>
<p>"Do you want fewer unemployed? Do you want to help Russian enterprises? Do you want us to stand on our own feet and work at full strength? Then I say to you, buy our goods, our Russian goods, and you won't regret it," he said.</p>
<p>He complained that Russia was flooded with promotions of foreign goods, but domestic firms could not afford to advertise.</p>
<p>Yeltsin acknowledged that some Russian factories had to improve the quality of their goods to make them competitive at home, but he singled out food and drink, and the arms and space industries, as sectors which could prosper.</p>
<p>"Russia has always been proud of its armaments and space technologies. We are not behind other countries, we are often in front of them. Many countries are keen to buy Russian arms."</p>
