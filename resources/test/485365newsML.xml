<p>The stock of International Business Machines Corp. fell in heavy trading on Thursday, hit by a report that analysts were cutting their 1997 earnings forecasts for the giant computer company.</p>
<p>The sell-off fuelled the overall stock market's fourth sharp sell-off in five days as investors were already scared that Friday's March employment report, if robust, could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again soon.</p>
<p>IBM fell $3.25 to $130.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was among the most active issues in afternoon trading.</p>
<p>IBM shares began their tumble in London, where investors first read a Wall Street Journal article, which said analysts may not be through cutting IBM's earnings estimates.</p>
<p>The report renewed fears that a stronger dollar and a mainframe product transition will hurt IBM's first quarter earnings, due April 23, and depress the stock even further. A strong dollar makes sales overseas worth less in dollar terms.</p>
<p>"If IBM either misses already reduced earnings estimates or 'talks down' estimates for the second quarter, it could not only take the already badly bruised tech group down even further, but it could also inflict another blow on the market as a whole," the article said.</p>
<p>An IBM spokesman declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter, IBM's profits jumped 18 percent to $2.02 billion, or $3.93 per share, from $1.71 billion, or $3.09 per share, in the year-ago period. Revenues rose 6 percent to $23.1 billion from $21.9 billion.</p>
<p>While profits were bolstered by strong services and software sales, analysts were disappointed with IBM's sluggish mainframe sales and restructuring costs. The company also managed to meet forecasts by lowering its corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>The report said Morgan Stanley cut IBM's 1997 earnings estimate to $12.30 a share from $12.50. For all of 1996, IBM earned $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share.</p>
<p>On March 20, Dean Witter Reynolds analyst Jay Stevens lowered his first-half earnings estimates for IBM, saying customers might hold off purchases of mainframes until an anticipated upgrade. Some analysts are expecting initial shipments in June.</p>
<p>Stevens added to his estimates for the second half of the year, however, saying the year would be more back-end loaded, as customers make purchases in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Also in March, Merrill Lynch said it would be tough for IBM's first-quarter earnings, which it estimated at $2.32 a share, to compare with the year-ago period. The analysts' consensus estimate is $2.31 a share for the first quarter, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.</p>
<p>For the first quarter of 1996, IBM posted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $2.48 a share, excluding charges associated with software acquisitions and other special items.</p>
<p>Traders dismissed a rumour that began surfacing a week and a half ago that IBM would pre-announce an earnings shortfall. "I heard the rumour but I wouldn't put any credence to it," said one technology trader.</p>
<p>Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial analyst, said IBM has pre-announced an earnings shortfall only twice in its recent history. Helmig maintained his first-quarter earnings estimate of $2.32 a share, which he has had since February.</p>
<p>"It's going to be tough to make that number and I doubt that they can overachieve it," Helmig said. But he added that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed drastically since February so he sees nothing new to impact his estimates.</p>
<p>Just after 2 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 53 points at 6,464 after an initial plunge of more than 80 points.</p>
