<p>Baghdad has withdrawn many of its troops from the main Kurdish city of Arbil in northern Iraq, an Iraqi-backed Kurdish group said on Sunday.</p>
<p>"About 40,000 Iraqi soldiers had entered. A large portion of that -- more than half of them -- have withdrawn," Husameddin Mohammed, a senior official for the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in the northern Iraqi town of Zakho, told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Iraqi troops backed by armour and artillery intervened on Saturday in inter-Kurdish fighting in northern Iraq on the side of KDP leader Massoud Barzani to recapture Arbil from Jalal Talabani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.</p>
<p>"Talabani joined with Iran, and in response, we came closer to Iraq. We got their support," Mohammed said.</p>
<p>Iraq earlier pledged to withdraw from northern Iraq, but had not set a date. Washington expressed scepticism over Iraq's intentions.</p>
<p>The two Kurdish factions have a history of bloodshed and shifting alliances with Iraq and Iran. The fighting in Arbil derailed the latest in a series of peace talks, which had been scheduled to take place in London.</p>
