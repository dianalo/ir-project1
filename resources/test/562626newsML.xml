<headline>Mexican leftists, police scuffle over Clinton visit.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Several hundred Mexican leftists -- shouting "Idiot Clinton" and burning U.S. flags -- tussled with riot police outside the U.S. Embassy on Monday, in a bid to sour the pending arrival of the U.S. president.</p>
<p>As Clinton arrived on U.S. Air Force One at the international airport the other side of Mexico City on Monday evening and was flown by helicopter to a military parade ground out of the public eye.</p>
<p>Television news programme, 24 Horas, reported there were five protests at various sites in Mexico City during the day, and that 14 people were arrested in the scuffles.</p>
<p>As Clinton arrived for his first state visit to Mexico, the protestors jeered his name as riot police bearing batons and shields kept them away from the embassy gates.</p>
<p>"Long live Che Guevara, Clinton go to hell," the protestors yelled, some waving Cuban flags celebrating Washington's bitter Latin American enemy, others burning the U.S. Stars and Stripes amid widespread jubilation.</p>
<p>They mainly protested new U.S. immigration laws that opponents say could lead to mass expulsion of Mexicans, but they also lambasted Clinton's support for Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, whose party has ruled Mexico for 68 years.</p>
<p>When riot police, who had been discreetly sequestered up side streets earlier in the day, rushed to block the marchers from reaching the embassy, scuffles broke out and two journalists were lightly injured in the shoving match.</p>
<p>There were no reports of serious violence.</p>
<p>The Mexican government has thrown a tight security cordon around parts of the city Clinton is due to visit, using armed troops to man checkpoints and keeping riot troops in the background in case of protests.</p>
