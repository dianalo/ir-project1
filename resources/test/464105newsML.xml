<p>Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, challenged his Labour counterpart Gordon Brown on Monday to match the ruling party's guarantees on tax and spending.</p>
<p>At an election campaign news conference, Clarke promised that the Conservatives would not increase taxes in 1997-98 above the figure of 36.25 percent of national income set out in its existing plans.</p>
<p>He also reiterated the government's promise to reduce public spending to below 40 percent of national income in 1997-98 and to reduce the budget deficit "back toward balance over the next few years."  </p>
<p>Clarke accused Brown of repeatedly dodging important questions on economic and tax policy. He said Brown and Labour leader Tony Blair had "manufactured a cardboard cut-out replica of bits of our policy, which would be quickly punched through by events."</p>
<p>He said "today I am issuing ten challenges to Gordon Brown on specific aspects of taxing and spending. In every case, we are making an unequivocal Conservative guarantee. Labour have got the opposrtunity to level with the British people. Now is their chance to do so."</p>
<p>Britain faced a clear choice at the May 1 election, Clarke added.</p>
<p>"It is to continue down the path of stable and sustainable economic success, or to make a change for change's sake to put stability at risk and entrust our economic future to a party which does not understand what makes a successful economy tick," Clarke said.</p>
