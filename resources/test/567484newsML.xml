<title>NETHERLANDS: Shell issues first world-wide environment report.</title>
<headline>Shell issues first world-wide environment report.</headline>

<p>Royal Dutch/Shell Group on Wednesday issued its first ever report on the environmental impact of its world-wide activities, showing its emission levels have been more or less stable.</p>
<p>The "Health, Safety and Environment Report" assessed the environmental impact and safety standards of Shell's activities in over 120 countries.</p>
<p>They were not externally verified.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide emissions totalled 105 million tonnes in 1996, up from 1995 and at the higher end of the five-year norm, which Shell blamed on higher refining throughputs and extra energy required to improve the quality of fuel products.</p>
<p>"The bottom line is that refinery operations require more energy," said a Shell spokesman.</p>
<p>However, the reduction of flaring will, Shell hopes, lead to lower emissions in the future.</p>
<p>Energy consumption has risen at its chemicals businesses, but in the refining sector, energy use has been largely constant as energy efficiency measures offset the greater demands required to make higher quality products.</p>
<p>Sulphur dioxide emissions have fallen, dropping below 400,000 tonnes in 1996. Nitrogen oxide output, by contrast, rose to nearly 250,000 tonnes in 1996, the result, says Shell, of a new plant being brought into operation.</p>
<p>Shell also announced it has and will continue to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons.</p>
<p>At the same time, Shell says the precise effect of greenhouse gases on climatic change is highly uncertain.</p>
<p>"There is still no scientific evidence that man-induced climate change is happening now," Shell's report said.</p>
<p>Shell says it will cooperate with governments who wish to take precautionary measures and is undertaking a small number of projects to test the commercial viability of renewable energy. However, Shell believes fossil fuels will continue to dominate world energy consumption.</p>
<p>"Curbing the use of fossil fuels has obvious business implications for Shell," the report said.</p>
<p>The report followed Shell's new statement of business principles, issued in March, which stressed the company's commitment to human rights and sustainable development.</p>
<p>Environmentalists welcomed the report.</p>
<p>"It is a step in the right direction," said Martijn Loderwijkx of Greenpeace. "They've realised they had to change their attitude and they know what the issues are."</p>
<p>However, Loderwijkx expressed reservations about Shell's commitment to sustainable development.</p>
<p>"It has some interesting statements but it's not getting anywhere. This report does not, for example, contain any carbon dioxide reduction targets.... The conclusion seems to be that (sustainable development) is prudent, but not possible," he said.</p>
