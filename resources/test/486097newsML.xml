<p>The Australian government said on Thursday it would take at least a generation to solve Aboriginal health problems after a report found indigenous Australians had among the world's shortest lifespans.</p>
<p>A major report has found that Aborigines have a life expectancy of 15 to 20 years less than white Australians, meaning only Indians and the poorest Africans die younger.</p>
<p>"If we have learned anything from the past...it is going to take a long time to fix this," Australian Health Minister Michael Wooldridge said.</p>
<p>"I would love to say we are going to make dramatic inroads in two or three years...but it is going to take the best part of a generation," Wooldridge told reporters.</p>
<p>A report released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday found that Aborigines were markedly more prone to dying of heart disease, stroke, pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, cancer, diabetes or injury.</p>
<p>The report also found that Aboriginal babies are two to four times more likely to die at birth, Australia's 300,000 Aborigines are 15 to 18 times more likely to die from an infectious disease, and have a higher rate of mental illness.</p>
<p>"Indigenous Australians suffer a higher burden of illness and die at a younger age than non-indigenous Australians and this is true for almost every type of disease or condition...," said the report.</p>
<p>"The health disadvantage of indigenous Australians begins early in life and continues throughout the life cycle," it said.</p>
<p>The report found that inadequate housing, a lack of clean water, poor nutrition, obesity, smoking and alcohol and drug abuse were the main contributors to the problem.</p>
<p>In launching the report in the northern Australian city of Darwin, Governor-General Sir William Deane said the health of Australia's indigenous Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders was "appalling".</p>
<p>"The report provides cogent confirmation of the general proposition that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage in our country is devastating in its extent and entrenched in its nature," Deane said.</p>
<p>"It extends across the whole spectrum of human life."</p>
<p>Deane said nothing could justify any further delay in tackling the overwhelming health problems faced by Aborigines.</p>
<p>Australia's leading Aboriginal spokesman said he hoped the report would prompt government action to solve the health problems facing Aborigines.</p>
<p>Gatjil Djerrkura, chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), said Aboriginal ill health could be directly traced to European settlement of Australia 200 years ago and the treatment indigenous people received.</p>
<p>"They brought new diseases and dispossession from our lands meant our people were forced to live in new types of communities," Djerrkura said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Traditional medicines and traditional cultures could not deal with the impact of these changes," he said.</p>
<p>The report found that inadequate housing, a lack of clean water, poor nutrition, obesity, smoking and alcohol and drug abuse were the main contributors to poor Aboriginal health.</p>
<p>But Australia's health minister Wooldridge said his one-year-old government would not simply throw money at Aboriginal health.</p>
<p>Australia's conservative Liberal-National coalition government has slashed A$400 million (US$312 million) from indigenous spending over the next four years as part of wide-ranging budget cuts -- about 10 percent of ATSIC funding.</p>
<p>"We have tried throwing money at the problems but it hasn't worked -- its made things worse," Wooldridge said.</p>
<p>"People are smoking more, people are drinking more, there is a sense of despair. It is going to be a long, slow, unglamourous hard slog to fix this."</p>
