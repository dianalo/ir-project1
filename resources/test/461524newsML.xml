<p>Former rebel UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi has said he will remain head of the largest opposition group in Angola and not accept a post in a unity government, the U.N. special representative said.</p>
<p>"At last we have definitely approved the special status of Jonas Savimbi," special representive to Angola Alioune Blondin Beye told reporters late on Friday night.</p>
<p>"I can't hide my satisfaction that we have finally solved this matter," Beye said.</p>
<p>UNITA's chief representative to the Joint Commission, also comprising government officials, observer nations and the U.N., told reporters that Savimbi had agreed to the role of ..."president of the largest opposition party".</p>
<p>Angola's ruling MPLA party had offered Savimbi the post of vice-president in the unity government but the UNITA leader had remained noncommittal until now and the long delay in installing the unity government frustrated U.N. officials.</p>
<p>Diplomats on Saturday said Beye's announcement on Savimbi's status was a breakthrough for the U.N. body, which had hoped to have the unity government in place by March 31 when its mandate expires, but not necessarily encouraging for lasting peace.</p>
<p>"So what if we get a unity government by the end of the month," one diplomat said. "That will be nice for the U.N. but it really doesn't mean much for peace in Angola.</p>
<p>"UNITA will not have any power within a unity government and could be much more effective not having anything to do with it...," the diplomat told Reuters.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, was due to arrive in Angola on Saturday to try to speed up the process, armed with a Security Council threat to consider sanctions against the party responsible for any further postponement.</p>
<p>A report by Annan this week mainly blamed the UNITA former rebel movement for the delays.</p>
<p>The diplomats said Savimbi's goal was to ultimately become president of Angola.</p>
<p>"Savimbi wants to manoeuvre himself into a position where he can some day become president. He has recognised that he stands a better chance of becoming president by staying outside the unity government than inside it," one Western diplomat said.</p>
<p>"He doesn't want to be part of it because he doesn't want to bear any responsibility for its actions."</p>
<p>Another diplomat said Savimbi had finally agreed to the title of opposition leader only because he was forced into it.</p>
<p>"There is a fairly serious Security Council deadline looming at the end of the month and Kofi Annan is coming to town to put pressure on him -- He had to do something," the diplomat said.</p>
<p>UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) and the MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) battled each other in a civil war which broke out on independence from Portugal in 1975.</p>
<p>In 1994 the two sides signed a peace accord that has brought the southern African country the longest period of peace since the war started.</p>
<p>Beye said the inauguration of the national unity government would take place after the remaining UNITA members set to become part of the unity government, arrived in the capital Luanda, indicating this would take place before the end of March.</p>
<p>He also said UNITA had agreed to send all but five of its remaining deputies, who are set to take up seats in the National Assembly as opposition members, to the capital on Saturday.</p>
<p>"We feel this has completely unblocked the process and now we are ready to go forward and work towards the establishment of a government of national unity," said Isaias Samakuva, UNITA's representative to the Joint Commission.</p>
<p>Samakuva made it clear though that Savimbi would not attend the inauguration ceremony.</p>
<p>Samakuva also announced a meeting between Savimbi and Annan was possible, but only if the U.N. boss was prepared to go to UNITA's headquarters at Bailundo in Angola's central highlands.</p>
