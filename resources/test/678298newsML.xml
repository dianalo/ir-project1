<p>North Korea's countryside bristled with soldiers sowing rice plants as the communist state greeted the first day of a summer predicted to be its grimmest since the Korean War, members of an ethnic Korean tour group said on Saturday.</p>
<p>"The farm areas I saw were about as green and as full of activity as here," an elderly Korean resident of Japan said in the northern Japanese port town of Niigata, a lush farm district.</p>
<p>Another member of the group of 275 people on a Pyongyang- sponsored family reunion tour, which included 150 teenage students, said his relatives were "struggling stoically" amid shortages.</p>
<p>"There's no denying the hardship, but Korean people are tough," said the man, 42, who declined to be named.</p>
<p>Amid expert warnings that the famine stalking North Korea could become critical this summer, repeated pleas for food aid by relief agencies have not raised enough donations.</p>
<p>Passengers returning to Japan on Saturday aboard the Mangyongbong 92, whose two monthly visits serve as the Stalinist country's only steady contact with the outside world, refused to discuss the issue of food aid or politics.</p>
<p>But several said that during a drive from the eastern seaport of Wonsan to the capital, Pyongyang, and to mountainous areas they saw no outward signs of tension or abnormal activity in the run up to two major North Korean anniversaries.</p>
<p>The approach of June 25, the 47th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, has seen Pyongyang media issue daily warnings of a "final battle" in what analysts say is a probably a fresh bid for diplomatic contacts with the United States.</p>
<p>And on July 8, North Korea marks the third anniversary of the death of state founder Kim Il-sung, a milestone that analysts have said could clear the way for his son, Kim Jong-il, to take over as head of the state and ruling party.</p>
<p>In the meantime the United States and South Korea await North Korea's reply to their offer to join four-nation peace talks, including China, to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
