<p>The soft oils sector of the European vegetable oil market closed mostly lower on Monday in nervous trading.</p>
<p>Traders said uncertainties over which direction Chicago would take following the news of rain in Brazil, and a strong dollar kept the market on edge.</p>
<p>The U.S. market opened lower but as the European market was closing values had turned higher.</p>
<p>"One minute sellers are there and the next they have disappeared and it's the same story with the buyers," said a trader.</p>
<p>Dutch soy oil closed 0.50 guilders down to unchanged while rape oil was 0.75 guilders down to 0.50 guilders up after January traded at 96.50 and March/April at 96 guilders a 100 kilos fob ex-mill.</p>
<p>In some cases trader felt sellers would come lower if pushed.</p>
<p>Traders said although the palm oil market was also nervous, setting closing prices was more straight forward.</p>
<p>Crude palm oil cif Europium closed $2.50 up to $5 down with no business reported.</p>
<p>Products finished around $2.50 lower.</p>
<p>Coconut oil closed with sellers $5 up to $2.50 down while palmkernel oil was $2.50 to $5 lower.</p>
