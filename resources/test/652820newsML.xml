<p>The Czech National Bank (CNB) fixed the crown on Wednesday at 32.129 to the dollar after Tuesday's fixing at 32.236, and at 18.760 to the mark from 18.820.</p>
<p>The rates correspond roughly with the levels on the interbank market at 11.30 a.m. (0930 gmt) when the central bank calculates its daily fixing.</p>
<p>On May 27, the central bank eliminated its fluctuation band within which it would fix the crown up to plus/minus 7.5 percent of a mark/dollar basket, and now uses the fixing only as a daily reference point reflecting the market.</p>
<p>The fluctuation band was dropped after the central bank was forced to intervene on numerous occasions in recent weeks to defend the crown which had been under heavy downward pressure.</p>
