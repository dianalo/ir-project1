<p>CHRISTCHURCH, July 6 - Andrew Mehrtens passed the fitness test set by the All Black selectors in his club match for High School Old Boys against Sydenham at Rugby Park on Sunday and has been included in the touring team to South Africa.</p>
<p>The first five-eighths had his troublesome right hamstring injury on trial before All Blacks coach John Hart and team doctor John Mayhew.</p>
<p>Mehrtens was content to play as a link almost throughout the match, preferring to pass rather than kick or run.</p>
<p>He made one good save under pressure late in the game and took two kicks without any discomfort.  </p>
<p>Hart and Mayhew watched most of the game before leaving for the airport and Mehrtens spoke to them as soon as the match had ended.</p>
<p>"I felt I pushed things as much as I could without being silly. Obviously I wasn't at 100 percent though," Mehrtens said.</p>
<p>"I've now got two weeks before the next test to get my speed and fitness up."</p>
<p>Hart said tonight that Mehrtens had done what was asked of him to be included in the touring team to South Africa.</p>
<p>"It was pretty low-key really and we didn't want him to overdo it.  </p>
<p>"He did what we wanted and that was to show us he had confidence to get out and play."</p>
