<p>The chief prosecution witness in the trial of three footballers and an Asian businessman accused of rigging matches said on Monday that Bruce Grobbelaar talked about getting paid for fixing games.</p>
<p>Chris Vincent told England's first match-rigging trial in 30 years that Grobbelaar, his former business partner, had said that retired striker John Fashanu had introduced him to men from the Far East who would pay him up to 2,000 pounds ($3,322) a week to predict the result of games.</p>
<p>"Mr Grobbelaar said something along the lines of "You know those people I talked to you about from the Far East, well, I'm going to meet one of them and we are going to discuss getting paid for fixing football games'," Vincent said, describing events in August or September 1993.</p>
<p>He said Grobbelaar had also complained that his club Liverpool was paying him less than some of the newer players.</p>
<p>When Vincent asked Grobbelaar how he could fix a match, the soccer star said that after 14 years as Liverpool's goalkeeper nobody would notice if he was to stand a yard or a foot off his line.</p>
<p>Grobbelaar, 39, Fashanu, 34, and Dutch-born former Wimbledon goalkeeper Hans Segers, 35, are charged with conspiring to give and accept corrupt payments in order to rig matches.</p>
<p>All four defendants, who face up to seven years in prison and unlimited fines if convicted, deny the allegations.</p>
<p>They were charged after an investigation into alleged match-riging and corruption. The case began in November 1994 after the Sun newspaper, supported by accusations from Vincent who is in custody on another matter, accused Grobbelaar of being corrupt.</p>
<p>Vincent was the first witness to testify in the case.</p>
<p>He told the court in southern England that he and Grobbelaar drove to a hotel in Manchester where the soccer star met a man of Far Eastern origin. The two men walked into a men's toilet and after they came out Grobbelaar motioned to Vincent to following him to the car.</p>
<p>"When we got into the car, he pulled out a white envelope from his trousers and pushed it behind the seat," Vincent said.</p>
<p>The Zimbabwean-born footballer, who won five league titles for Liverpool, is accused of taking 40,000 pounds ($66,900) to influence the outcome of the Liverpool game against Newcastle in November 1993. Newcastle defeated Liverpool 3-0.</p>
<p>Television presenter and businessman Fashanu denies giving Grobbelaar the money as a reward for having improperly influenced or attempted to influence the outcome of the match.</p>
<p>Last week while outlining his case, chief prosecutor David Calvert Smith said the defendants could not explain why they handled large sums of money and were in contact with each other around match dates.</p>
<p>Grobbelaar is accused of trying to fix four matches, three of which failed. Segers deposited 104,000 pounds ($175,000) into a Swiss bank account between October 1993 and November 1994, a period which saw his side lose 14 times when he was playing, the prosecution said..</p>
<p>Neither Segers, nor Fashanu and Heng Suan Lim, who both received large amounts of money from Indonesia, had reasonable explanations for the additional funds, Calvert Smith told the court last week.</p>
