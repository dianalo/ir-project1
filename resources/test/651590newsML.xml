<p>Nippon Dantai Life Insurance Co Ltd said on Tuesday it does not plan to boost its investment in foreign securities in the current fiscal year to March 31, 1998.  </p>
<p>A company official told a news conference that the firm would maintain its current holdings of foreign securities while closely watching currency rates.</p>
<p>He said it boosted its foreign investments in the last fiscal year, with its outstanding foreign securities holdings standing at 920.64 billion yen as of the end of March, up sharply from 554.63 at the beginning of March 1996.</p>
<p>He said the firm had 26.1 billion yen worth of bad loans and problem loans at the end of March, against total assets of 4.05 trillion yen.</p>
<p>He said the level of the Nikkei 225 stock average at which the company's profits from stock holdings would fall to zero was 16,600 points. The comparable level for the TOPIX index was 1,260, he said.</p>
