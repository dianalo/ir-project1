<p>The Economic Affairs and Constitution and Justice committees of the Brazilian Senate Thursday approved a bill overhauling the corporate tax system, an official said.</p>
<p>The Senate official said the bill would go to the full floor of the upper house later on Thursday.</p>
<p>The new bill, which takes effect in 1997, eliminates the so-called transfer price, a measure which has allowed multinational firms to pay less tax by underreporting exports and overvaluing imports at their Brazilian subsidiaries.  </p>
<p>The bill also allows for deductions for poor-performing loans, charges tax on real profit and not presumed profit and changes the schedule for corporate tax payments to quarterly from monthly.</p>
