<p>Hong Kong schoolchildren have been asked to line roads and welcome arriving Chinese garrison troops when China takes over on July 1, a newspaper said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The South China Morning Post said 50 primary and secondary schools had written to parents asking if their children could turn out to greet the People's Liberation Army by waving and clapping at the border.</p>
<p>Chinese troops will take over defence duties from the departing British. The PLA is expected eventually to deploy up to 10,000 soldiers in its Hong Kong garrison, but it is not clear how many will roll over the border at dawn on July 1.</p>
