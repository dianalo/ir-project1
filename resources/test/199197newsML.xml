<p>The Polish zloty was around two percent from the trading band centre throughout the day in generally balanced trade but a strong fixing by the central bank may signal large post-trade currency-sales, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said on Tuesday the market focused on foreign investors, whose moves in and out of Polish treasuries often spark market trends, but that today foreigners were not interested in selling currencies.</p>
<p>"Foreigners were more inclined to sell their Polish T-bills today, so the pro-zloty fixing had to be caused by other factors," said Bogdan Stepkowski from ING Bank in Warsaw.  </p>
<p>The zloty closed flat at 2.06/2.02 percent from the trading band centre against yesterday's close at 2.05/2.02 percent.</p>
<p>It closed at 2.8107/17 to the dollar, up from 2.8142/48 on Monday and at 1.8705/15 to the mark, down from 1.8675/80.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Poland fixed the zloty at 2.8070 to the dollar and at 1.8700 against the mark, or about 2.15 percent from the trading band centre.</p>
<p>Many dealers said the level of today's fixing was surprisingly high in comparison to market rates.</p>
<p>"It seems the zloty did not trade at the levels of today's fixing," one dealer at a Polish bank said.  </p>
<p>Poland's official currency reserves grew by $146 million in October to $17.7 billion and were $3.48 billion higher than a year ago, the central bank said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>One-day deposits rates fell on the interbank market under weight of reserves accumulated on banks accounts, but dealers said rates may rise later this week on monthly tax payments.</p>
<p>Overnight rates closed at 18.60/18.70 percent against opening's 18.90/19.00 percent. Tomorrow/next were at 18.70/19.15 percent versus 18.60/19.10 percent.</p>
