<p>German debt markets will come in for a beating in the coming week as French elections and domestic fiscal problems double up to threaten the potential power of Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>Bunds were already bruised after a strong left-wing showing in the first round of elections in France prompted worries that European economic and monetary union (EMU) entry rules will be bent to fit political wishes.</p>
<p>And economists say any confirmation of a swing to the left at next Sunday's second round, particularly with disgruntled talk at home of "creative accounting" by Germany to meet EMU criteria, will drain more buying interest from Bunds.</p>
<p>"All this political uncertainty in Europe is certainly having an impact on Bunds. As well as France, political risk is also on the rise in Germany against the backdrop of the fiscal deficit and uncertainty of how to solve the problem," said Armin Kayser, German economist at Swiss Bank Corp in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Analysts said that Bonn's announcement last week of plans to revalue Bundesbank gold and currency reserves had given a clear signal to markets that Germany was putting the EMU timetable ahead of the need for real convergence.</p>
<p>Despite efforts to convince markets otherwise, with finance minister Theo Waigel stressing again on Monday that EMU entry rules must been rigorously applied, the reserve proposal suggests the euro will be softer than many had hoped and will be perceived as a unit built on shaky foundations, they said,</p>
<p>"Comments from Waigel reiterating that the Maastricht criteria must be strictly interpreted suggest he is convinced his gold fudge will go through unchallenged," one analyst said. "We would be more cautious on this issue."</p>
<p>The prospect of a left-wing French government, led by socialist leader Lionel Jospin who has left few doubts that he favours a flexible approach to the Maastricht criteria, simply adds to the woes surrounding Europe's benchmark debt market.</p>
<p>"At this point the market is reacting quite correctly by assuming that if the French left wins on Sunday, we are more likely to see a weakening of convergence criteria than EMU postponement," said Thomas Mayer, economist at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>June Bund futures lost around 20 basis points in value on Monday, suffering in sympathy with weak French debt prices after combined left-wing parties polled 40.22 percent in Sunday's first round of voting. On Tuesday, the contract was also struggling with losses.</p>
<p>Bunds had already taken a hit in the previous week, dropping sharply as traders talked of international investor moves to underweight German assets as suspicions sharpened that Germany was preparing an EMU "fudge" with its revaluation plan.</p>
<p>"A French left wing final victory will lead to further losses," said Mayer. "The market is beginning to price this in now. Before, the market was fairly convinced the right-wing would win, but now we are seeing the fallout from the higher probability of a left-wing win."</p>
<p>Until recently, the "flight-to-quality" factor -- where international investors take refuge in a perceived stable currency with limited political risk -- might have shored up Bunds and protected the market from deep losses.</p>
<p>But Germany has, for the time being at least, been demoted from its long-held European safe-haven status.</p>
<p>"If you look at the way Waigel is presenting his gold plan and other ways to cut the fiscal deficit, it is difficult to define those efforts as 'quality' work," said SBC's Kayser.</p>
<p>Mayer at Goldman Sachs agreed.</p>
<p>"Bunds have lost their quality function. The quality has been undermined by its own government's scrambling to meet the EMU criteria and apparently also using accounting operations."</p>
<p>The German government is expected to present a draft proposal of its asset revaluation plans to the Bundesbank on Wednesday, although it is not clear whether any official statement will be made.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Bund market will welcome clarification on how, if at all, the move would help German plug its deficit or national debt holes, but they said the real damage was already done and investors are likely to turn away from Bunds.</p>
<p>"Since Germany does not enjoy the safe haven status it used to, you start to ask why you should accept 5.93 percent German 10-year yields when you can get more elsewhere from countries like Spain, which has fairly decent fundamentals and an equally good chance of meeting the EMU criteria," said Mayer.</p>
