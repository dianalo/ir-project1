<p>Efforts are under way to arrange a meeting between Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the next few days to try to clinch a deal on the West Bank town of Hebron, a senior Egyptian official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A senior Palestinian official said he understood the meeting could be held in Cairo under the auspices of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.  </p>
<p>"The talk is that this meeting could be held tomorrow or the day after, but this is not certain," Osama El-Baz, chief foreign policy adviser to Mubarak, told reporters at a Washington seminar on the Middle East.</p>
<p>However, Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, general secretary of the Palestinian Authority cabinet, said he understood the possible dates were Friday or Sunday, because Saturday is the Jewish sabbath.</p>
<p>Baz said the meeting had not yet been fixed definitively because of remaining problems with the Hebron agreement, under which Israeli troops would withdraw from most of Hebron.</p>
<p>He said the problems related to Israeli right of hot pursuit into Palestinian-controlled areas of the town and to the arming of the Palestinian police force.</p>
