<title>UK: Mercury to boost residential battle with BT.</title>
<headline>Mercury to boost residential battle with BT.</headline>

<p>Mercury Communications Plc said on Friday that its recent alliance with three UK cable operators would allow it to provide British Telecommunications Plc with tougher competition in the UK residential market.</p>
<p>"We now have a great opportunity to compete more strongly and to take on BT in different ways," said Adrian Chamberlain, who heads the residential and small business operations of Mercury, the UK arm of Cable &amp; Wireless.</p>
<p>Mercury is merging with the UK cable operations of NYNEX, Bell Canada International and Videotron in a company with the working title Cable &amp; Wireless Communications.  </p>
<p>The deal gives the new company a direct link to a potential six million homes in London, north-west England and Scotland.</p>
<p>Chamberlain told reporters at a lunch briefing that the new company would give him "a lot more cards in his hand" in a residential market which BT continues to dominate.</p>
<p>Mercury has some 700,000 residential customers but targets heavy users of long-distance and international calls after moving away from attempts to take on BT across the board.</p>
<p>It finds it more difficult to compete with BT on local calls because BT tends to retain control of the last part of the loop linking households to the network.  </p>
<p>Some 1.2 million business exchange lines access the Mercury network and large corporate customers generally have a direct fibre or radio link into the system.</p>
<p>Chamberlain said there were a total of around 400,000 homes connected to the Internet in the UK but that this was growing by 10 percent each month, presenting a "very exciting" market.</p>
