<p>Deutsche Lufthansa AG has begun operating A-319-100 jets on its regular routes between Germany and medium-range Russian and CIS destinations, the head of the company's Moscow office said on Monday.</p>
<p>Ulrich Ruger, regional director for Russia and Commonwealth of Independent States operations, told a news conference the planes replaced Boeing 737-200 jets on Lufthansa routes to Moscow, St Petersburg, Samara, Nizhny Novgorod, Minsk and Baku.</p>
<p>"We see these jets as more efficient and ecologically cleaner compared to Boeing 737-200 planes," Ruger said.</p>
<p>From this month Lufthansa has also begun upgrading passenger services on five CIS destinations, setting up special check-in desks for business class passengers at airports.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman told Reuters the new standards would be fully introduced on CIS routes by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Lufthansa currently flies to 13 destinations in the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>
