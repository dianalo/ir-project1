<p>When Nantes beat Bordeaux five months ago they were getting into their stride for an unbeaten run that now stands at 23 matches.</p>
<p>That victory, their sixth game unbeaten, lifted the 1995 champions out of the relegation zone and into 16th place in the French first division, while Bordeaux were eighth.</p>
<p>Nantes travel to Bordeaux for Tuesday's Atlantic coast derby having overtaken their rivals in the standings, climbing to third with a 1-0 home win over Lille while Bordeaux, fourth one point behind, were held 1-1 at Nancy.</p>
<p>"It's an important psychological advantage which forces Bordeaux to win to go ahead again," Nantes midfielder Bruno Carotti said.</p>
<p>But Bordeaux coach Rolland Courbis said he was leaving three first-choice players on the bench, without naming them, "to show that the French Cup quarter-final against Montpellier at the weekend is more important".</p>
<p>Bordeaux, already in the League Cup final, are chasing a domestic cup double.</p>
<p>Nantes' top scorer Japhet N'Doram said: "Even if the calendar of the next weeks is unfavourable, with Marseille and Strasbourg to follow, we've all given too much to let this third place slip just like that and Bordeaux will have to shift us to beat us."</p>
<p>Coach Jean-Claude Suaudeau feels his team can play even better, although he is pleased with the away form that has brought them five wins in succession.</p>
<p>"From what I have seen over the last few weeks, the team has a growing potential," Suaudeau said. "I even think the players are not entirely aware of this.</p>
<p>"In some heads, there is a holding back I don't understand. We saw that against Lille. I would like to see their confidence express itself better.</p>
<p>"Maybe the pressure and what's at stake will remove this resistance on Tuesday evening," he said.</p>
<p>"The team have talent, a solid base at the back and they travel well... But against Bordeaux there is often an irrational side."</p>
<p>Nantes have yet to lose with teenager Mickael Landreau in goal. Landreau has played in 21 of the 23 matches of the unbeaten run since making his debut in the 0-0 draw at Bastia on October 2.</p>
<p>With 51 goals in 30 games, Nantes have the second best attack in the division, behind leaders Monaco.</p>
<p>Suaudeau will be without injured defenders Eric Decroix and Serge Le Dizet but forward Claude Makelele returns, while Bordeaux have defender Bernard Lambourde suspended.</p>
