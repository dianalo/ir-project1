<p>Zimbabwean industrial shares maintained their march ahead on Wednesday as refunds from an issue by a local merchant bank continued to flow into the market, finding a home mainly in blue-chip counters, brokers said.</p>
<p>The main 57-share industrial index rose 48.75 points to close at 10,457.46, lifted largely by agriculture investor Chemco's 350-cent leap to 4,750 and publisher Zimpapers's 100-cent jump to 5,600.</p>
<p>"There's about Z$400 million in refunds coming back into the market from the NMB (National Merchant Bank) issue. The attention has mainly been on the blue-chips and we expect the market to continue firm for the foreseeable future," one broker said.</p>
<p>Also among the day's winners, pharmaceutical group Caps rose 160 cents to 1,550, farming implement-maker Zimplow added 50 cents to 750 as did Alloys to 550 while electronics company Apex put on 25 cents to 300.</p>
<p>Minings were subdued on the back of a lower bullion price with most counters trading unchanged while gold finvestor Falcon surged 300 cents to 1,600.</p>
<p>The secondary mining index put on 3.79 points to 1,023.82.</p>
