<p>Talk of a halt in the dollar's rally against the yen might send a few shudders through global debt markets but calls for a more stable yen are unlikely to lead to a major sell-off, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a bid to profit from low financing costs in Japan, international investors have borrowed in yen, then converted into other currencies to buy into different debt markets.</p>
<p>Analysts say a large chunk of that investment was directed into European high-yielding bond markets, U.S. Treasuries and other dollar-bloc government debt -- markets which could suffer heavily if the yen's fortunes were to turn.</p>
<p>The yen has clawed its way back from its lows after Japanese officials said action should be taken to limit excessive currency swings.</p>
<p>But analysts said the recovery was likely to be muted. Yen-funded bond buying might slow slightly but there was little chance of a major sell-off, they added.</p>
<p>The yen stalled at a peak of 79.70 per dollar in April 1995 and stumbled as low as 117 in Tokyo on Monday before recovering to around 115.50 currently.</p>
<p>Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase in London, said an apparent Japanese drive to halt yen weakness would carry some potency in the short term and might take the shine off global bond markets, particularly ahead of a meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations in Berlin on February 8.</p>
<p>"If there is a fear that the G7 will adopt a pro-yen objective, then given the recent success of the G7, the markets may get a little scared and run for cover," said Gunner.</p>
<p>Nigel Richardson, bond economist at Yamaichi International in London, agreed the yen's decline would stall and markets would begin to realise that the Bank of Japan was changing tack.</p>
<p>"We're seeing something fairly fundamental happening here, he said. "A verbal policy towards the yen is now in place."</p>
<p>Japanese authorities were clearly aiming to block the dollar's rally and establish a less volatile yen at slightly firmer levels, he said.</p>
<p>"The Japanese have achieved their target for yen weakness and they are beginning to see the benefits come to fruition now," said Richardson, citing signs that Japan's trade position was beginning to improve with the weaker yen.</p>
<p>"What they're looking for now is some kind of stabilisation."</p>
<p>"You're beginning to take away the idea that the yen is a one-way bet. So there is a potential threat to ongoing capital outflows from Japan," said Andrew Bevan, senior bond economist at Goldman Sachs in London.</p>
<p>But analysts played down fears that a wall of money would burst out of international bonds and back into Japanese asset markets.</p>
<p>They noted slightly more upbeat noises coming from the Bank of Japan about a pickup in economic activity but said the Japanese economy remained sickly.</p>
<p>With interest rates at rock-bottom levels -- Japan's key official discount rate is just 0.5 percent -- a weak yen is one of the few avenues left to authorities hoping to stimulate economic growth.</p>
<p>"Such is the weakness of the Japanese economy, it would be difficult for them to reverse the recent trend in dollar/yen," said Chase's Gunner.</p>
<p>Goldman's Bevan agreed, saying he was not expecting any significant flow of funds sparked by a yen reversal.</p>
<p>"In broad terms, we are at levels on dollar/yen that are not that far way from fair vaule at the moment," he said. "But we might go through a volatile, choppy period for the next several months."</p>
