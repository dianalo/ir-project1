<p>German international Heiko Herrlich pounced on two defensive mistakes to give Borussia Dortmund a 2-1 win over Poland's Widzew Lodz in their European Cup Champions' League group B match on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Defender Andrzej Michalczuk headed a cross into Herrlich's path on the six-metre line, giving him  a simple header and Dortmund the lead just before halftime.</p>
<p>Midway through the second half Michalczuk blundered again, heading a cross from Stephane Chapuisat across his own goalmouth.</p>
<p>Herrlich, back in the starting line-up for the first time since tearing ankle ligaments last March, pounced to score from close range.</p>
<p>He came close to completing a hat-trick a few minutes later when he took a return pass from Austrian international Wolfgang Feiersinger and sent a dipping shot centimetres over the bar.</p>
<p>Dortmund then let the three-times Polish champions back into the game. Juergen Kohler was slow to pick up Marek Citko on the edge of the box and managed only to deflect his drive past goalkeeper Stefan Klos.  </p>
<p>"It wasn't a beautiful game but we won and that's what counts," Herrlich said.</p>
<p>Dortmund coach Ottmar Hitzfeld was equally philosophical: "You have to make your opponent make mistakes but those really were two gifts from the Poles."</p>
<p>Lodz showed enough flashes of technical skill to suggest they will pose problems for the other teams in the group, Steaua Bucharest and Atletico Madrid.</p>
<p>Their disciplined performance wiped out the memory of a previous excursion to Germany four years ago when they lost 9-0 to Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
