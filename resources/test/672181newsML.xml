<p>Cholera has returned as a major threat in many areas of the world and there are now more cases than ever, researchers said on Friday.</p>
<p>Despite major public-health campaigns it has returned to Latin America and new epidemics have broken out in Bangladesh, Jose Sanchez and David Taylor, U.S. Army medical researchers, said.</p>
<p>"The massive outbreak of El Tor cholera among Rwandan refugees in Goma, Zaire, resulting in 70,000 cases and 12,000 deaths in July 1994, showed that during times of crisis cholera can be catastrophic," they wrote in a report in the Lancet medical journal.</p>
<p>They noted that cholera had returned to Peru in 1991 after having been absent more than 100 years.</p>
<p>"Within two years the disease had spread from Peru to Mexico, and in the past six years there have been 1.4 million reported cases of cholera, causing more than 10,000 deaths in the Americas," they wrote.</p>
<p>In 1992, 75 passengers on board an airliner returning to Los Angeles from the region became infected with cholera -- one person died. It was traced to a contaminated seafood salad prepared in Peru.</p>
<p>This illustrates the dangers of cholera, which spreads when infected faeces gets into the water supply.</p>
<p>It can go into a dormant state, reactivating, for example, when water temperatures rise.</p>
<p>"Clearly, cholera can present as a severe form of traveller's diarrhoea," they added and said doctors should be in the look-out for it.</p>
<p>"Routine surveillance of expatriates living in endemic areas (where cholera is established and common) suggests a substantial risk exists."</p>
<p>Vaccines were being improved but still had to be given several times before they were effective, Sanchez and Taylor said.</p>
<p>"The hope is that oral cholera vaccines, killed and live, will become readily available for use in immunisation programmes in developing countries and for travellers, expatriates and military personnel," they wrote.</p>
