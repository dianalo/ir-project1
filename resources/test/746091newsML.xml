<p>Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc said Tuesday 1997 gold sales may be higher than projected because of potentially higher gold grades during the second half of the year.</p>
<p>The company said second quarter mill throughput of its principal mining unit, P.T. Freeport Indonesia Co (PT-FI) achieved excellent operating results during the second quarter, with mill throughput averaging a quarterly record 130,800 metric tonnes of ore per day.  </p>
<p>Mill throughput is expected to continue between 125,000-130,000 tonnes daily until completion of the fourth concentrator mill expansion, Freeport Copper said.</p>
<p>Freeport said PT-FI has commitments for essentially all of its expected 1997 concentrate sales, which are now estimated to total at least 1.1 billion pounds of copper and 1.65 million ounces of gold.  Third and fourth-quarter 1997 copper sales are projected to approximate second quarter levels.</p>
<p>During the quarter, PT-FI sold 305.9 million pounds of copper and 431,700 ounces of gold.  This compares with 269.2 million and 269.2 million, respectively, a year earlier.  </p>
<p>It said this boosted second-quarter net income per share to $0.35, more than double the $0.15 earned a year earlier.</p>
<p>First Call consensus for the quarter was $0.34.</p>
<p>Net income, before preferred dividends, rose to $79.1 million from $42.7 million last year.</p>
<p>During the latest quarter, the company said, it benefited from the re-pricing of "open" concentrate sales, primarily because of higher copper prices; the sale, net of acquisition costs, of copper put option contracts; and copper and gold forward sales contracts.  </p>
<p>Second-quarter revenues include favorable adjustments to March 31 open concentrate sales totaling $23.3 million, the company said.  It said this added $11.3 million, or $0.06 per share, to net income.</p>
<p>At June 30, copper sales totaling 304.0 million pounds, which were recorded at an average price of $1.06 per pound, remained to be finally priced.   About 60 percent of these</p>
<p>open pounds are expected to be finally priced during the third quarter of 1997, with most of the remaining pounds to be priced during the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Freeport said a $0.01 change in the average price used for these open pounds would have an approximate $1.3 million effect on 1997 net income.</p>
<p>It said PT-FI's cash production costs, after gold and silver credits, averaged $0.290 per pound of copper during the second quarter.</p>
<p>It said unit production and delivery costs are expected to decline in the second half of 1997 because of higher second half sales of copper.  For the full year, costs are estimated to approximate the 1996 average.  Additionally, gold credits in the second half of the year, which will be influenced by gold prices, could benefit from higher gold grades.</p>
