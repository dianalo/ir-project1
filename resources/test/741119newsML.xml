<p>China's stock markets are overwhelmed by retail investors and it is time for Beijing to set up more institutional stock funds to help stabilise the markets, the China Securities newspaper said on Saturday.</p>
<p>There are currently more than 30 million stock trading accounts on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges with only a few opened by domestic institutions, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>"Such a huge number of retail investors participating in stock trading is a rare case in the world and its negative impact is apparent," the newspaper said.</p>
<p>"Retail investors lack information and understanding of the markets, it said. "Their investment is blind."</p>
<p>In addition, most of China's retail investors are ordinary workers and their income levels are unable to bear the risk of stock trading, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>"All these factors add to the risky, speculative nature of the stock markets and cause market volatility," the newspaper said. "Establishing institutional investment funds is a necessity after the stock markets have developed to certain stage," it said, adding China's stock markets were now large enough for big institutional investors.</p>
<p>By the end of June this year, China had a total of 36 billion listed shares with a value of 461 billion yuan against only 18 billion shares worth 79 billion yuan at the end of 1995, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>"Quick market expansion has created enough market capacity for institutions to invest in the markets," the newspaper said.</p>
<p>"Repeated market plunges and surges have also added weight to the need for institutional investment funds."</p>
