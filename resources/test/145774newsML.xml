<p>Some 1,200 Kurdish refugees fleeing inter-Kurdish fighting in northern Iraq are waiting to cross the border into Iran, joining tens of thousands already seeking refuge there, the Iranian news agency IRNA said on Saturday.</p>
<p>It quoted the head of the Red Crescent Society in Sardasht, northwestern Iran, as saying the refugees were gathering at three border areas and blankets, clothing and food had been distributed over the past two days.</p>
<p>"The recent ceasefire between the Baghdad-backed Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) in northern Iraq has provided an opportunity for those who want to escape the fighting to flee the region," IRNA said, based on comments by the Red Crescent's Qasem Hassan-Nejad.</p>
<p>Western relief groups said on Monday 15,000 new refugees had arrived in Iran since October 18 and that little food or water was available to the refugees, living in cold mountain camps.</p>
<p>There were no recent figures on Kurdish refugees sheltering in Iran, which last month put their number at 65,000.</p>
<p>U.S. envoy Robert Pelletreau secured a ceasefire promise from the leaders of the two Kurdish factions at separate meetings in Turkey during the past week and on Wednesday the U.S. State Department announced the groups had agreed to observe a ceasefire from midnight Iraqi time.</p>
<p>Iran is home to two million refugees, 1.4 million from Afghanistan and 600,000 from Iraq, making it the world's most important host country, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
