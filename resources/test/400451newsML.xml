<p>Ireland prop Nick Popplewell said on Tuesday he was struggling to recover from a hamstring injury ahead of Saturday's Five Nations championship game against Scotland at Murrayfield.</p>
<p>Popplewell, 31, pulled a hamstring when playing for English league division two side Newcastle against Leicester in the Pilkington Cup at the weekend and was unable to take any part in an Irish squad training session on Monday.</p>
<p>"The injury is not great at the moment. I had to go off after about 35 minutes on Saturday after I pulled the hamstring in a scrum," Popplewell said. "It has improved but whether it has improved enough to allow me play in an international is another thing."</p>
