<p>Five Spanish NATO peacekeeers escaped injury when their armoured vehicle was hit by an anti-tank rocket in a Croat sector of Mostar overnight, a NATO spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>"It is a blatant challenge to us...we will take whatever action is necessary to remove a potential threat," Major Tony White, of the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR), said.</p>
<p>"SFOR responded to the attack by deploying a quick-reaction force to the scene and our presence in the area has been substantially increased, with increased patrols."</p>
<p>The response team failed to find the attackers but recovered two used rocket launcher canisters about 100 metres (yards) from where the NATO vehicle was hit.</p>
<p>Mostar was a scene of bitter Moslem-Croat fighting in 1993 which left the city divided into hostile Moslem and Croat sectors.</p>
<p>Moslems and Croats complained to the United Nations police in Mostar of shots being traded across the Neretva river on Thursday afternoon, spokesman Alex Ivanko said. The U.N. could not confirm this report.</p>
<p>Ivanko said a large explosion shook a disco club in west Mostar on Thursday afternoon, causing no casualties but inflicting substantial property damage.</p>
<p>In Sarajevo, two grenades caused minor damage to a Roman Catholic church in a mainly-Moslem part of the city on Thursday evening.</p>
