<p>Shell has a cushion of about 1.8 million barrels of Forcados crude oil to act as a shield against potential supply disruption caused by the occupation of some of its Niger delta pumping stations at the weekend, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>Shell said it had been forced to reduce output by about 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) since Saturday because of the incident, but exports in March would be unaffected.</p>
<p>Traders said the oil giant had two standard-sized cargoes of 900,000 barrels of Forcados, one due to load in the next two or three days and the other at the end of March.</p>
<p>The oil was expected to end up on one very large crude carrier with capacity for 1.8 million barrels.</p>
<p>The two cargoes were handed back to Nigeria earlier in March by a lifter unable to sell it profitably in a weakening market.</p>
<p>Traders said it was not immediately clear on what basis Shell had claim to the oil.</p>
<p>It might be part of its equity stake "but if (Nigerian state oil company) NNPC asks the equity holder to get rid of some Forcados it will take care of it," a trader said.</p>
<p>"What's clear is that this will help their (Shell's) marketing of Forcados," the trader said.</p>
<p>Shell officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Shell produces almost half of Nigeria's two million barrels per day of crude oil.</p>
