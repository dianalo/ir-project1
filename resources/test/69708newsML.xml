<p>A senior International Monetary Fund official on Monday brushed aside worries about Argentina's fixed exchange rate system.</p>
<p>"We are not concerned either about the convertibility currency board system or about the political will (to carry it out)," the official, who declined to be named, told reporters ahead of the annual IMF/World Bank meeting here this week.</p>
<p>He argued that no one in Argentina challenges the currency board system, although there are differences in the country over the structural economic reforms needed to back it up.  </p>
<p>"In Argentina, nobody now challenges the convertibilty plan," the IMF official said. "They now know it is there and will be a lasting feature for the next few years."</p>
<p>But the government does face plenty of political problems over structural measures, although it is determined to overcome them, he said.</p>
<p>Among the issues: reorganization of union-run health care organizations, streamlining of the health care and pension system and further strengthening of the financial sector.</p>
<p>The IMF official said that Argentina's economic recovery "is well on its way." The IMF expects growth there next year of five percent.</p>
<p>The IMF board is expected to approve Argentina's economic reform program in October.</p>
