<p>A pioneering treatment for cancer known as antisense therapy has worked surprisingly well in early trials and could offer a whole new way to fight cancer, doctors said on Friday.</p>
<p>Four out of nine patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, an incurable cancer, got better after treatment and in one patient the tumour completely disappeared, said Dr Andrew Webb and colleagues of Britain's Royal Marsden Hospital.</p>
<p>"The results are far better than we anticipated at such an early stage of the drug's development," said Dr David Cunningham, principal clinical researcher on the trial.</p>
<p>"The treatment also seems to be largely devoid of the type of side-effects often associated with traditional therapies. It's the first time this approach has been shown to work in humans and the results hold out genuine hope for patients with lymphoma."</p>
<p>Cunningham's group used synthesised short pieces of DNA -- the material that makes up genes -- and designed them to adhere to messenger RNA (ribonucleic acid).</p>
<p>Messenger RNA carries the codes that tells cells which proteins to make. They are called "sense" strands while synthetic DNA pieces designed to bind to them, and thus stop them from working, are called "antisense strands".</p>
<p>Webb's team targeted a protein known as BCL-2 which is over-produced in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and interferes with apoptosis, the process of programmed cell suicide that normally prevents cancer. Failure of apoptosis allows damaged cells to replicate out of control into tumours.</p>
<p>The synthetic antisense molecule -- Anticode G3139, made by U.S. drug company Genta Inc -- was designed to bind to messenger RNA carrying instructions for BCL-2.</p>
<p>The antisense DNA was given to nine patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma over two weeks.</p>
<p>"No treatment-related toxic effects occurred, apart from local inflammation at the infusion site," they wrote in their report in the Lancet medical journal.</p>
<p>"In two patients, computed tomography (CT) scans showed a reduction in tumour size (one minor, one complete response)." Two more patients had fewer cancer cells circulating during treatment.</p>
<p>"Our findings are encouraging and warrant further investigations of BCL-2 antisense therapy in cancer treatment," they concluded.</p>
<p>They said this first trial was aimed at finding out whether the treatment was safe and only the lowest doses were used.</p>
<p>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is incurable but patients are usually given about 10 years to live because the tumours grow slowly and at first can be stalled by chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Eight of the patients in the trial were given drugs afterwards and responded very well to the chemotherapy.</p>
<p>They said perhaps the most important use of antisense therapy in this case would be to overcome tumours that have become resistant to drugs.</p>
<p>Antisense therapy is being tested against a range of diseases from breat cancer to asthma, but is still highly experimental.</p>
