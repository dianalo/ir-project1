<text>
<p>Serbian riot police wielding batons pushed and struck a handful of demonstrators who were among several hundred marching through central Belgrade on Monday, witnesses and independent radio said.</p>
<p>One of the demonstrators, an unidentified woman, was knocked down on the street and was later driven away in an ambulance, according to film taken by a Reuters television crew. The extent of her injuries was not known.  </p>
<p>Independent Radio Index said the demonstrators had run up against a cordon of riot police at Terazije Square.</p>
<p>Riot police approached them from another square and started pushing them, hitting a few with batons, including the woman who was taken away in an ambulance.</p>
<p>Violent incidents have been rare in recent weeks in the two-month-long protest campaign by pro-democracy demonstrators demanding that the government reinstate the results of November municipal elections won by the Zajedno (Together) coalition.</p>
<p>The last serious incident was during street battles between rival opposition and pro-government rallies on December 24 in which one man was shot in the head.</p>
