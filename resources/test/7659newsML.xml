<p>President Boris Yeltsin will shortly sign a decree naming Pyotr Rodionov as minister of fuel and energy, Itar-Tass news agency said on Thursday, quoting the presidential press service.</p>
<p>Rodionov, who has the same surname as Defence Minister General Igor Rodionov, is currently a board member of Russian natural gas monopoly RAO Gazprom and managing director of its St Petersburg subsidiary Lentransgaz.</p>
<p>Rodionov would replace Yuri Shafranik, who was energy minister in the last government.</p>
<p>Most ministers in the new government were announced last week, but several portfolios, including fuel and energy , were left vacant.</p>
