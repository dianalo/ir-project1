<p>Tillinghast principal John Ryan said on Wednesday it would take a $50 billion disaster to shift property catastrophe rates,.</p>
<p>"Another Hurricane Andrew that cost $30 billion would just stabilise the market," he said.</p>
<p>If there is no disaster of this magnitude, only a stock market crash would be significant enough to put pressure on rates.</p>
<p>Speaking at an alternative risk financing conference, Ryan said insurers, including catastrophe insurers which use securitisation as a means of diversifying portfolios, are effectively utilising excess capital.</p>
<p>This will lead to some smoothing of the insurance cycle.</p>
<p>As well as some widely publicised securitisation transactions, such as the recent USAA deal, Ryan said there would be an increase in the number of banking contracts.</p>
<p>These contracts are a means by which a bank provides a loan to the insurer when a specific event occurs but the terms are negotiated in advance. It is a means for the insurer to secure capital to write business without transferring risk.</p>
