<p>Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) deputy governor Stephen Grenville said on Friday he expected downward pressure on U.S. wages to relent at some stage as the U.S. hit its natural level of full employment.</p>
<p>Grenville said that U.S. workers' fears of losing their jobs would eventually ease as the U.S. unemployment rate continued to push down towards five percent.</p>
<p>"Sooner or later this run does come to an end," Grenville told a meeting of the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA).  </p>
<p>"How far can you press unemployment down before you are scraping the bottom of the barrel?," he said.</p>
<p>Grenville said the wage restraining effect of job losses through restructuring could not last forever.</p>
<p>"You can't go on pressing more growth out of the U.S. economy," he said.</p>
<p>Grenville would not comment on the domestic economy and the inflation outlook when asked later by reporters.</p>
