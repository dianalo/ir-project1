<p>Zhanna Pintusevich ran the second fastest women's 200 metres of the year on Wednesday at an athletics meeting at a high-altitude training centre.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian ran 22.17 seconds into a wind of 2.3 metres per second at the meeting in the southern Spanish mountains at a height of 2,320 metres.</p>
<p>Pintusevich, the 1994 European championship silver medallist, followed up with a 100-metres victory in 11.14 seconds.</p>
<p>Olympic champion Lydmilla Enquist of Sweden won the women's 100 metres hurdles in 12.67 seconds.</p>
<p>Only Enquist herself and American Melissa Morrison have run faster this year.</p>
<p>Charity Opara of Nigeria also took advantage of the altitude and clocked 49.79 seconds in the women's 400 metres, the third-fastest time of the year over one lap.</p>
<p>Cuba's world record-holding high jumper Javier Sotomayor produced his best performance since he limped out of the Olympic final last year.</p>
<p>Sotomayor, the 1991 and 1993 men's world champion, cleared 2.30 metres.</p>
<p>Since his poor showing in Atlanta, Sotomayor has had operations on his left knee and ankle.</p>
