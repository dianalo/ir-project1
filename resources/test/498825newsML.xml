<p>COMEX copper clawed itself back into the black by close after trading lower for most of the lackluster session.</p>
<p>Traders blamed the absence of significant fund interest and fresh fundamental news for the lack of direction in the market. The funds sold heavily on Monday.</p>
<p>"People are still suffering from the Fed rate hike and the opinion there will be one or two more," Richard Hirsch of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said. "But they are missing the central point - the Fed hike is not aimed at metal consumption sectors, it's aimed at the stock market and the wage unit costs hike."</p>
<p>He expected the market to remain choppy until enough of a consensus emerges to push it in one direction, probably slightly higher.</p>
<p>May COMEX settled 0.10 cent firmer at 107.75 cents per pound, traded 107.90 to 106.70 cents. Spot April went out 0.10 cent weaker at 108.90 cents.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 6,800 lots.</p>
<p>Traders said the May contract needed to trade at 109.50 cents and above, the previous trading level since February, to inject a more convincing tone into the market.</p>
<p>Tags shrugged off Thursday's LME stock report which showed a further decline on Wednesday when stocks fell 1,775 tonnes to 160,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>So far this week stocks on the London exchange have fallen some 14,000 tonnes as traders get used to daily reporting introduced Monday, taking away some of the drama.</p>
<p>On Thursday Phelps Dodge reiterated that its pay freeze deal offered to Chino copper mine workers last August was its final offer.</p>
<p>Workers from Chino protested outside the company's Phoenix head office on Wednesday against the deal and healthcare benefit changes. Both sides meet on April 24-25 for talks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Prudential Securities said it now thinks the much-heralded surplus in the copper market will not arrive until 1998.</p>
<p>The brokerage estimated that mine and smelter outages this year, plus a few deferrals on new projects, now total nearly 565,000 short tons on an annualised basis, up from an earlier estimate at 375,000 tons.</p>
<p>"Combined with a 4.2 percent level of world consumption, supply and demand are roughly in balance, inventories are low and London Metal Exchange prices averaged $1.09 per pound in (the first quarter of 1997), or $0.04 per pound above our estimate. We maintain that this is temporary in nature with the surplus position now being pushed in 1998," Prudential said.</p>
