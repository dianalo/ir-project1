<p>U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations gave at least $12.5 million in political donations to U.S. candidates and parties in 1995 and 1996, according to an independent study released on Monday.</p>
<p>The study by the Centre for Responsive Politics found that 128 U.S. subsidiaries of 93 foreign-owned companies from 16 countries gave money to U.S. campaigns. More than two-thirds of their contributions went to Republicans, with Democrats taking nearly one-third.</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, such donations are legal. But the Democratic Party, under fire for accepting illegal donations directly from Asian business interests and individuals, said earlier this year it would no longer accept them.</p>
<p>With investigators probing campaign donations from Asians, the report noted most of the reported donations from foreign-owned companies came from European and Canadian interests.</p>
<p>British-owned subsidiaries accounted for one third of the total. Canadian-owned subsidiaries were second, followed by Swiss, Australian and Japanese companies.</p>
<p>The top individual donor was Joseph E Seagram &amp; Sons, a subsidiary of the Canadian Seagram Co, which gave $1.6 million, divided almost equally between Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>Second was Brown and Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of Britain's BAT Industries, which gave just more than $1 million, of which $939,500 went to Republicans.</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp was third, giving $835,000 to Republicans and only $94,000 to Democrats.</p>
