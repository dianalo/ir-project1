<p>Motherboard giant Asustek Computer Inc said on Monday the total value of its global depository receipt issue in London on Friday was about US$235.8 million, making it the biggest GDR issue by a Taiwan firm.</p>
<p>"Our company on May 23...successfully issued an equivalent of 21 million shares in GDRs, raising some US$235.8 million," Asustek said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Asustek -- nicknamed Taiwan's "king share" because its share price is the island's runaway highest at T$373 per share at Monday's close -- said the US$235.8 million raised would be put toward expanding its existing motherboard production and funding plans to produce notebook computers.</p>
<p>Asustek did not say when it might begin notebook manufacturing.</p>
<p>Asustek in 1996 posted a huge pre-tax profit of T$4.07 billion (US$146 million) on sales of T$13.33 billion (US$479 million).</p>
