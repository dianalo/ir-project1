<p>The U.S. farm debt, boosted by higher capital expenditures and rising farmland prices, rose by an estimated 3.6 percent to $156.2 billion in 1996, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Farm debt approximated $156.2 billion at the end of 1996, up 3.6 percent from the year before," the Chicago Fed said in its Agricultural Newsletter.</p>
<p>The Chicago Fed stressed the figures are estimates based on data from main lending institutions serving U.S. farmers -- banks, insurance companies and the Farm Credit System -- as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).  </p>
<p>The estimated 3.6-percent surge in farm lending in 1996 was sharply above the 2.7-percent average rise recorded in 1993-95, the Chicago Fed said, stressing this reflected "willingness and ability of lenders to extend new credit to farmers and the ability of farmers to repay existing loans."</p>
<p>The Chicago Fed noted the complexity of factors affecting a surge in farm lending but highlighted "the relatively prosperous conditions in 1996 (that) also triggered increased capital expenditures and more aggressive bidding on farmland."</p>
<p>U.S. farmland was more attractive to U.S. farmers as an investment. The majority of farm loans were extended in the real estate sector for the second consecutive year of increase in that sector -- reversing 10 prior years of decline.</p>
