<p>Ninety-five percent of soybeans were harvested versus 84 percent a week earlier, 81 percent a year ago and 86 percent on average.</p>
<p>Winter wheat was 84 percent emerged, ahead of 81 percent last week but behind 91 percent last year and 96 on average.</p>
<p>Seventy-eight percent of sorghum was harvested compared with 56 percent last week, 70 percent last year and 65 percent average.</p>
<p>Eighty five percent of sunflowers were harvested versus 57 last week, 69 percent last year and 72 percent on average.</p>
