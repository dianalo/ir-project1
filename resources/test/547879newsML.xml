<p>CSCE coffee futures were called to open 2.00 cents per lb lower on Tuesday, as traders expected the market to give back some of Monday's gains.</p>
<p>New York arabica futures settled higher in quiet trading on Monday, underpinned by ongoing supply concerns. July arabicas rose 3.15 cents per lb on the day, to end at 196.40 cents, after posting trades between 197.50 and 192.00 cents. Spot May finished up 3.90, to 220.25, while the outer months ended 4.75 higher to 3.40 lower.</p>
<p>The nearby May/July switch, a barometer of nearby availability, widened to 23.85 today from 23.10 at the close on Friday.</p>
<p>Technically, traders said July would face strong psychological resistance at the 200.00 level. The next upside hurdle was seen at 203.50 cents, a life-of-contract high set on Friday. Support was seen at Monday's low of 192.00 cents.</p>
<p>After Monday's close, the CSCE reported certified coffee stocks were unchanged, at 48,603 bags as of April 25. There were 3,815 bags of coffee pending grading, the exchange said.</p>
<p>In other news, the head of Colombia's National Coffee Growers' Federation said late Monday that he sees the country's coffee stocks falling to 3.5 million 60-kg bags by September from 6.0 million bags in the same month a year ago and about 5.0 million bags earlier this month.</p>
<p>Jorge Cardenas said Colombia was looking at a 1996/97 (Oct-Sept) coffee yield of no more than 10 million bags, slightly lower than previous estimates and well below the 13 million bags produced in 1995/96.</p>
<p>He also said the recent truck drivers' strike delayed shipment of some 200,000 bags of coffee.</p>
<p>LIFFE coffee futures were flat to lower early Tuesday, after a firm start. At the midday break, July was unchanged, at $1,600, while spot May fell $13, to $1,532.</p>
