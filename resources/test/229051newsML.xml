<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Advanced Radio started buy.</headline>
<text>
<p>-- Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said it started coverage of Advanced Radio Telecom Corp on Monday with a buy.</p>
<p>-- Analyst Stuart Conrad gave the stock a 12-month price target of $25, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said.</p>
<p>-- The company went public in early November at $15. It closed on Friday at $15.  </p>
<p>-- In a research report, Conrad said Advanced Radio has a nationwide "market footprint," meaning it has good spread throughout the country with 237 licenses in 169 markets, making the franchise "difficult to duplicate and ... very attractive to other telecom providers."</p>
<p>-- He also said the company has a large local telephone market potential, its 38 GHz radio technology that is a viable alternative to copper and fiber, rapid deployment and ease of installation, strong strategic partners, a highly experienced management team and a compelling valuation.</p>
