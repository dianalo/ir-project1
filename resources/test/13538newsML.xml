<p>Iran has eased price controls to try to reverse a 40 percent fall in Persian carpet exports, its second-largest hard currency earner after oil, newspapers and traders said Monday.</p>
<p>The daily Iran said a high state body that sets official prices approved a decrease in values set by customs officials on carpets. It did not give any figures.</p>
<p>Traders said officials agreed to cut by about 10 percent the values set on carpets being exported, lowering the amount of hard currency that has to be repatriated by exporters.</p>
<p>Carpet exports fell to $968 million in the Iranian year that ended on March 19 from $1.6 billion the previous year after Iran in May 1995 adopted rules requiring exporters to repatriate their hard currency income and exchange it at the official rate.</p>
<p>Traders had complained that exports were hampered by customs officials setting unrealistically high values on rugs. They said this forced them to export lower quality rugs, which damaged the prestige of Persian carpets abroad.</p>
<p>Traders and newspapers had expressed concern over the fall in the exports and urged measures to support the carpet weaving industry, which employs about two million people.</p>
<p>Officials said before the foreign exchange rules were imposed that only a third of the hard cash from Iran's annual non-oil exports of about $4 billion was being returned to the country through legal channels. The rest was going mostly toward smuggling luxury goods, they said.</p>
<p>The rules, which set an official exchange rate of 3,000 rials to the dollar, were adopted to support the Iranian currency after it fell to as low as 7,000 to the dollar on the black market following the announcement of sanctions against Iran by the United States.</p>
