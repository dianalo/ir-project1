<p>Shares in haircare-product maker Wella AG were strongly ahead in German bourse trade on Tuesday, albeit off earlier highs, after a positive reaction to the group's 1996 figures.</p>
<p>Preference shares in Wella were up 1 1/2 percent or 14.50 marks at 969.50 marks, off an intraday high of 981 marks, while the overall DAX index of German blue-chips was up 0.19 percent at 3,354 points.</p>
<p>Trading volumes in Wella shares were low early on, but analysts said that there was some confusion early on as to how the figures were to be intepreted.</p>
<p>The group forecast an earnings hike of 25 percent for 1997, but this was only a reiteration of a previous forecast made in the autumn.</p>
<p>Chemical analyst Martin Wirth at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt said that the forecast was enough to motivate buyers, even though the remainder of the group's figures were well within expectations.</p>
