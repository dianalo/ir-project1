<p>Papua New Guinea sought to reassure foreign investors on Friday after a 10-day political crisis that effectively shut down the capital and wiped millions of dollars off the value of listed firms.</p>
<p>As Port Moresby returned to normal after a crisis that saw soldiers blockade parliament, trapping politicians inside, and force Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan to stand down, the central bank and the Commerce Department issued a statement saying the business climate was recovering.</p>
<p>"At least one leading commercial bank has reported that there has been no capital flight, nor has there been any suggestion that investors and depositors were nervous," the Bank of Papua New Guinea and Commerce Department statement said.</p>
<p>"The (local currency) kina's trading levels against all currencies has remained stable over the period of unrest.</p>
<p>"The value of PNG stocks are recovering and financial analysts believe that they will return to their true value in the next week," the satement said.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea has no stock market, but some companies are listed in neighbouring Australia. Those stocks fell significantly when the crisis began, wiping millions of dollars of the value of listed companies.</p>
<p>Markets were closed on Friday for the Easter holiday, but PNG's Australian-listed stocks rallied in active trade on Thursday as foreign investors were relived by the apparent peaceful resolution of the South Pacific nation's crisis.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors welcomed Chan's decision on Wednesday to step aside, which calmed an explosive situation in this resource-rich nation of almost 4.5 million people.</p>
<p>The worst political crisis in Papua New Guinea's 22 years of independence was sparked earlier this month when military chief Brigadier-General Jerry Singirok demanded Chan step down over a A$46 million (US$36 million) contract with foreign mercenaries to quell a secessionist rebellion on Bougainville island.</p>
<p>Chan sacked Singirok, but suspended the mercenary deal and agreed to a government probe of the awarding of the contract.</p>
<p>But civil and military opposition spilled into the streets on Tuesday and Wednesday, forcing Chan to hand over power to caretaker prime minister John Giheno pending the outcome of the inquiry. Giheno said he would relinquish the leadership as soon as Chan was cleared by the inquiry.</p>
<p>Mining investment group Orogen Minerals Ltd, 51 percent owned by the PNG government, closed on Thursday up eight cents at A$3.10 (US$2.45). Oil producer and explorer Oil Search Ltd, the largest of the pure Papua New Guinea stocks listed in Australia, ended 13 cents higher at A$2.70.</p>
<p>Lihir Gold Ltd, which is developing one of the world's largest gold deposits, rose two cents to A$2.15. Retailer and trader Collins and Leahy Ltd closed up 25 cents at A$3.50, and Bougainville Copper Ltd firmed five cents to 60 cents.</p>
<p>But analysts said Papua New Guinea stocks were unlikely to immediately recover all their losses of the past 10 days as the makeup and policies of the caretaker government were unknown.</p>
<p>(A$1 = US$0.79)</p>
