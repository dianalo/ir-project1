<p>U.S. Treasuries edged down in post-holiday trade in Tokyo on Tuesday due to light profit-taking led by dealers.</p>
<p>"Prices were somewhat weaker after seeing the dollar falling off from its early highs, but the market lacked direction," a U.S. brokerage trader said.</p>
<p>Trading was nervous amid worries about the health of China"s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, but the direct impact on the Treasury market had been limited so far, traders said.</p>
<p>The 6-5/8 percent 30-year bond stood at 101-4/32, yielding 6.54 percent, compared with 101-8/32 in New York on Friday.  </p>
<p>described Deng"s condition as serious and said the government would closely watch developments.</p>
<p>"The dollar would probably react most sensitively to news on Deng. Given this mood, we cannot build up fresh positions in Asia," the trader said.</p>
<p>But underlying sentiment was starting to brighten following the recent convincing rallies.</p>
<p>Traders said the new benchmark 30-year bond yield may test below 6.5 percent soon, depending on consumer price index data due for release on Wednesday.</p>
