<headline>Mexico Cetes rate softens after high Friday close.</headline>

<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates opened down 25 basis points on Monday at 18.00 percent, falling from an artificially high close on Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, rates could succumb to upside pressure from the U.S. bond market as the session progresses and some light volatility in the peso, they said.</p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond was down 5/32 to yield 6.92 percent. The benchmark 48-hour peso was meanwhile up slightly by 0.05 peso at 7.9160/7.9190 per dollar.</p>
<p>Another analyst said rates could also increase on liquidity pressures ahead of the June 11 deadline for banks to settle balances outstanding on checking accounts they hold with the central bank.</p>
<p>"Some speculation could arise in the coming sessions as many players are short liquidity and have hefty positions in paper, so we may see rates come under pressure," he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said they did not expect overnight rates to rise above 18.50 percent during the session.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper were meanwhile unchanged at 19.15 percent.</p>
<p>Liquidity of 1.249 billion pesos was due to flow back into the system from prior central bank operations.</p>

<p>Dealers said liquidity pressures were noticeable in early trade because several brokers were short on liquidity and held surplus paper.</p>
<p>Overnight Cetes rates had traded as high as 18 percent during the session due to these liquidity pressures, dealers said.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, by mid-session, Banco de Mexico decided to drain 1.975 billion pesos from the market by assigning three direct Cetes sales and three repos.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper closed up 20 basis points at 19.30 percent.    Liquidity of 185 million pesos was scheduled</p>
<p>to return to the system on Tuesday from prior central bank participation, in addition to an estimated 1.5 billion pesos in bank bills from the weekend.</p>
