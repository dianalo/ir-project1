<p>Polish National Investment Fund (NFI) No 12 wants to focus on firms from few key sectors to prepare them for flotation or sale to selected investors, the head of the fund's management firm said on Friday.</p>
<p>Krzysztof Mikulski of Eurofund Management Polska Sp z xo.o. said the fund considered automotive parts production, textiles and chemicals as areas with the biggest growth potential.</p>
<p>"Our strategic goal is to sell (the firms of) the three sectors or place them on the bourse...but we don't want to sell our best firms now...they would be undervalued now," he said.</p>
<p>Mikulski said NFI 12 was interested only in placing its firms on the main market of the bourse.</p>
<p>He added the firms would need about two or three years to improve their financial standing and gain in value so they could be profitably floated on the bourse.</p>
<p>This time would give those companies a chance to work out clear strategies for the next five years, cut costs and possibly merge with other firms, Mikulski said.</p>
<p>Mikulski said the fund did not rule out buying new firms from the target sectors if it found good bargains with large growth potential.</p>
<p>NFI 12 is one of the 15 funds created under Poland's mass privatisation scheme which encompasses more than 500 companies.</p>
<p>The funds are expected to enter the Warsaw bourse in the second quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>NFI 12 had a net loss of 10.1 million zlotys in the first nine months of 1996. It had stakes in six automotive parts makers, seven textile firms and five chemical companies.</p>
