<p>An influential British parliamentary committee on Wednesday accused the London Stock Exchange of dragging its feet in implementing a fully electronic order-driven based system for trading shares.</p>
<p>The exchange is scheduled to convert to a system that matches buy and sell orders by computer in October 1997.</p>
<p>"There's a suspicion that you are stalling," Treasury Select Committee member Diane Abbott told LSE chairman Gavin Casey.</p>
<p>Under the exchange's current quote-driven system, share prices are set by primary dealers known as marketmakers. The LSE, Europe's busiest bourse, is the only major exchange that lets marketmakers set prices.</p>
<p>The LSE is still thrashing out the details of the new order-driven regime. It last amended the rules for the order book last month.</p>
<p>Committee member Quentin Davies suggested the exchange's approach to carrying out the new system was "half-hearted," "limited" and allowed too many exceptions to the rules.</p>
<p>Casey, who took the helm of the exchange in June after a bitter controversy over radical reforms forced his predecessor out, denied claims that the exchange was moving too slowly.</p>
<p>"We have to get it right and we will get it right. There's no point in rushing," Casey told the committee during a review of the exchange's progress in modernising its market.</p>
<p>"It must be right to take it in stages," he added.</p>
<p>Initially, 40 to 50 of the FTSE 100 stocks would go through the order book, Casey said. The FTSE 250 may be added in due course, he said.</p>
<p>A controversial rule that allows market makers to delay reporting large block trades raised concerns among committee members that the preferential treatment would compromise market transparency.</p>
<p>Casey acknowledged that rules could be abused in some cases, but said they could be modified as the process continued.</p>
<p>He said that unless the right balance between liquidity and market transparancy was stuck, business will move elsewhere.</p>
<p>"We will increase transparency as long as it doesn't drive business away, he said. "I would not want to be responsible for pushing it too far too fast and watch a lot of business disappear -- once it disappears it's my opinion that it'll never come back."</p>
<p>But MPs appeared unwilling to accept that there is an inverse relationship between transparency and liquidity.</p>
<p>"Maybe more transparency would produce more liquidity," said Barry Legg, who chaired the committee.</p>
<p>Despite the outstanding issues facing the exchange, the LSE seems to have made some headway since the last inquiry in July, Davies told Reuters after the meeting.</p>
<p>"I thought there was a renewed spirit there. They seem to acknowledge problems they previously were not willing to acknowledge," Davies said. "They are making progress, but it's slow." -- London newsroom +44-171-542-4026</p>
