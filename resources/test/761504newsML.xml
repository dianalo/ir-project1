<p>A Japanese court on Monday sentenced a "sokaiya" racketeer to five months in prison for extorting money from Ajinomoto Co Inc, the nation's top processed food maker.</p>
<p>In his ruling at the Tokyo District Court, chief judge Kiyoshi Kimura said racketeer Chosei Wada received two million yen ($17,094) from an Ajinomoto executive in December 1995.</p>
<p>Ajinomoto paid the cash to the racketeer in return for ensuring that the company's shareholders meetings ran smoothly, Kimura said.</p>
<p>"This is a vicious crime in which the accused ignored the spirit of the revised Commercial Code," Kimura said.</p>
<p>Japan's Commercial Code, revised in 1993, bans companies from making payments to sokaiya, who extort money from companies by threatening to disrupt shareholder meetings.</p>
<p>Chief judge Kimura also blamed Ajinomoto for bowing to pressure from the racketeer.</p>
<p>"The problem also rests to a considerable degree with the company itself, which succumbed to pressure from the sokaiya," he said.</p>
<p>In April, Ajinomoto said its president Shunsuke Inamori would resign over the scandal, in which two company officials were arrested and indicted on suspicion of making illegal payments to sokaiya.</p>
<p>Monday's ruling comes at a time when two top Japanese financial firms, Nomura Securities Co Ltd and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd (DKB), are facing fierce public and government criticism for making huge payoffs to racketeers.</p>
<p>A dozen top executives at Nomura and DKB, as well as the companies themselves, have been charged with giving cash or loans to a racketeer.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry is soon expected to unveil administrative penalties against Nomura and DKB for their admitted payoffs to racketeer Ryuichi Koike. ($1=117 yen)</p>
