<p>SIMEX Euroyen and Japanese government bond (JGB) futures firmed in sluggish trade on Thursday as the market shrugged off a sharp rise in Japan's machinery orders data for May.</p>
<p>"The data seemed to have a reverse impact. The figure was quite good but the market only went down one tick and then reversed back up," a trader at a U.S. brokerage said.</p>
<p>Japan's private sector machinery orders rose a seasonally adjusted 12.9 percent in May from the previous month.</p>
<p>The lead March Euroyen contract stood at 99.04 at 1115 GMT after trading a 98.99-99.04 range against an IMM close at 99.00.  </p>
<p>The trader said the contract should find some support at its day low, with resistance seen at 99.05 and 99.14.</p>
<p>Dealers said the Tokyo stock market's inability to lift itself out of the doldrums following a spate of bad corporate and financial sector news was helping underpin Japanese interest rate futures.</p>
<p>September JGBs ended at 124.93 against their previous 124.85. "JGBs are still range trading. The market will only show a clear trend if it breaks 125.05," the trader said.</p>
<p>Eurodollar futures continued to drag their feet due to a dearth of fresh incentives.  </p>
<p>But dealers said the market looked firmly supported after U.S. treasuries ended at seven-month highs overnight, boosted by bullish sentiment and positive technicals.</p>
<p>December Eurodollars ended at 94.065 against an IMM close at 94.070 on volume of 3,400 lots.</p>
