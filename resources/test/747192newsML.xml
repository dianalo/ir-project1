<p>A new diabetes drug offers "dramatic" results and could actually prevent the disease in patients at risk, researchers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Jerrold Olefsky of the University of California, San Diego, said Sankyo Co Ltd's drug troglitazone, marketed under the names Noscal and Rezulin, helped regulate blood sugar levels in glucose-intolerant people.  </p>
<p>"We are not talking about making things better -- we are talking about making things right," he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Troglitazone, marketed by Warner-Lambert Co in the United States, by Pfizer Inc and by Glaxo-Wellcome in Europe, helps improve the body's sensitivity to insulin.</p>
<p>It is the first in a new class of drugs known as thiazolidinediones, which reduce insulin resistance. Olefsky, one of the first clinicians to test the drug for Japan's Sankyo, says insulin resistance is reponsible for most cases of type-two diabetes, known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM).</p>
<p>The drug is licensed for use in diabetic patients who are not responding well to standard insulin or drug therapy.</p>
