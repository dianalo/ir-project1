<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares powered to yet another record high early on Friday, led by a strong Dow close and continuing stock shortages, dealers said.</p>
<p>The index was 16.5 points ahead at 4,596.9 by 0744 GMT, having touched 4,602, and breaking through last night's all-time high close.</p>
<p>Bullish sentiment surrounding Britain's new Labour government also helped support the gain, dealers said.</p>
<p>"We have bids and all sorts of euphoria. Just the sort of thing that happens close to the top of a bull market," said Charterhouse Tilney head of research, Richard Jeffrey.</p>
