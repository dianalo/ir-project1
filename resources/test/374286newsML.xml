<p>Belgian linear bonds ignored chart-technical overbought signals to continue their bull run on Wednesday and were expected to notch up further gains in the weeks ahead, analysts said.</p>
<p>"It's extremely bullish, both in the exchange markets and in bonds," said Conrad Fieremans at Kredietbank. "It looks like this train will keep on riding for a while," he said.</p>
<p>At 0913 GMT, the benchmark 2007 OLO was yielding 5.60 percent against 5.64 percent at the close on Tuesday. It outperformed its Bund equivalent with the yield spread further narrowing to five basis points from six late on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Traders noted continuing buying interest in the very long end of the curve, up to 20 years.</p>
<p>"Sentiment remains good in the long end, the curve has been seriously flattening," Fieremans said. But the recent buying had been predominantly domestic, he added.</p>
<p>He said that the Federal Reserve was likely to stick to the sidelines in the next few months following signs in the United States that the economy was not growing as strongly as expected.</p>
<p>European markets were also spared from inflation worries and any correction in the upward trend was likely to be sideways, not downwards, he said.  </p>
<p>The franc continued to strengthen against the mark and was quoted at 20.6280/90 against 20.63 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The franc had been under pressure in recent weeks following a bribery scandal affecting the francophone socialist party, one of four partners in the centre-left coalition government.</p>
