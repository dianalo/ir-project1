<p>Rwanda on Monday rejected hosting a multinational force for eastern Zaire, again arguing that foreign military intervention was irrelevant as most Rwandan refugees had returned home.</p>
<p>An officer with a foreign military advance team, which has been in Kigali for a week, said the Rwandan rejection meant any force approved by major Western powers would probably be based in neighbouring Uganda.</p>
<p>"Rwanda's position is any foreign force is irrelevant because the bulk of the refugees have returned," said Claude Dusaidi, a senior adviser to Rwandan military strongman Paul Kagame.</p>
<p>"Instead of sending a force, they should send humanitarian aid to Rwanda to help the returnees settle here," he said.</p>
<p>"It's their country," said a Western officer, who declined to be identified. "If they don't want us here then the force command headquarters will probably be in Kampala, Uganda, and the main operational base will be situated at Entebbe airport."</p>
<p>The small Canadian advance team in Kigali has no agreement with authorities on how it can operate, meaning it does not even know, for instance, if its staff can use Canadian driving licences in Rwanda or need Rwandan drivers to move around.</p>
<p>Laurent Kabila, leader of Rwanda-backed rebels who hold a swathe of Zairean territory bordering on Rwanda, has said his forces will fight any foreign troops in his "liberated" areas.</p>
<p>The Rwandan and Zairean rebel objections to the presence of any multinational force to aid humanitarian relief efforts and help Hutu refugees return home greatly complicate its mission.</p>
<p>Dusaidi told Reuters Rwanda interpreted various proposals for the force agreed by Western powers meeting in Stuttgart at the weekend to mean it would possibly end up helping fleeing Rwandan Interahamwe Hutu militiamen to regroup in east Zaire.</p>
<p>"We don't think this force will assist the refugees," he said.</p>
<p>"There are very few refugees in eastern Zaire right now. I just returned from the border and I saw some coming back," Dusaidi said. "There are very few, perhaps 150,000 to 200,000 just north of Bukavu in Zaire and they are on their way home."</p>
<p>The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says there are many more Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire being herded by former Rwandan Hutu troops and Interahamwe militiamen, who led the genocide in Rwanda of an estimated 800,000 people in 1994.</p>
<p>An estimated 600,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees have returned from eastern Zaire since November 15 to a cool reception from survivors of the 1994 genocide but the flood last week dried up to a trickle.</p>
<p>Rwanda's government, which took power after Tutsi-dominated rebels seized the country in 1994 and forced an end to the genocide by Hutus, says it agrees with a U.S. army team's estimates that only some 200,000 refugees remain in east Zaire.</p>
<p>It says many of them are Interahamwe militiamen and former Rwandan Hutu troops and their families who will never return.</p>
<p>Aid officials say a multinational force is needed for aid to reach refugees scattered throughout the forests and mountains of eastern Zaire but outside rebel-held territory.</p>
<p>Told that the force commander Canadian Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril had said he would set up a headquarters soon, Dusaidi said: "They can put it anywhere they want, not Rwanda."</p>
<p>"We cannot be party to or host a multinational intervention force when we aren't clear of its mission. I can't see what humanitarian corridors for refugees it can set up," he added.</p>
<p>The rebels say any international force will inevitably help prop up the rule of ailing Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
