<p>Independent directors of metal products maker Woodroffe Industries Ltd on Monday advised shareholders to take no action on a takeover offer by Hills Industries Ltd, pending further information.</p>
<p>In a statement, Woodroffe said its board had formed a subcommittee of independent directors to consider the offer and to engage an independent expert to provide a report for shareholders, as required by the Corporations Law.</p>
<p>Hills, which currently owns 49.82 percent of the ordinary issued shares of Woodroffe, has offered 75 cents a share for the remaining shares in the company.  </p>
<p>The offer is conditional on Hills becoming entitled to 90 percent of Woodroffe's ordinary shares and receiving acceptances from 75 percent of the remaining shareholders.</p>
<p>Woodroffe said shareholders would receive a formal offer and a Part A disclosure statement from Hills in due course, as well as a Part B statement response from Woodroffe, with the independent experts' report.</p>
<p>Woodroffe shares were six cents higher at 80 cents on Monday.</p>
