<p>Economic reforms have started to unsettle some Filipinos, spurring a group of free-market advocates to band together to ensure that the slow and sometimes painful liberalisation process is completed.</p>
<p>Former government officials, leading academics and businessmen have set up the Foundation for Economic Freedom to counter a threat from nationalists, leftists and special interest groups who advocate a return to state subsidies and government intervention.</p>
<p>"There are no 'isms' in this group. We are not a political group. We believe that market-based solutions work," Romeo Bernardo, the foundation's executive director, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Philippines once had to endure a series of boom-bust cycles in a highly protected economy which spawned private monopolies and inefficient state-run institutions.</p>
<p>But in 1992 President Fidel Ramos began a far-reaching economic liberalisation programme in the telecommunications, mining, transport, energy, and financial services sectors. This has been coupled with sweeping fiscal reforms, particularly aimed at halting widespread tax evasion.</p>
<p>The foundation believes the reforms will ultimately benefit all Filipinos although they will do away with the economic privileges enjoyed by the country's traditional ruling elite.</p>
<p>"The reforms that need to be undertaken, set on a longer view of the Philippine future, (do not always benefit) an existing constituency...It is more usual that potential beneficiaries are inarticulate social sectors," the foundation's prospectus says.</p>
<p>"This pits the reform process against highly articulate sectors defending old policy structures for the sake of short-term privileges and entitlements."</p>
<p>The foundation believes that every sector of the economy is best left to private enterprise.</p>
<p>"Resources, especially fiscal resources, should not be wasted. We should not subsidise the producers. If you need to subsidise, we should subsidise the consumers. Let the consumer choose," said Bernardo.</p>
<p>The former finance ministry under-secretary said the group started as an informal discussion group in early 1994 after the government's proposed oil tax increase crumbled in the face of popular opposition.</p>
<p>Filipinos enjoy some of the lowest fuel costs in Asia but when the government tried to impose a modest levy in February 1994 to help close its widening fiscal deficit it was forced to climb down in the face of widespread opposition.</p>
<p>"We had a situation where the government was on its own. United against it were labour groups, the church, some industrialists, the left and all its variations and the right and all its variations," Bernardo said.</p>
<p>"There was no one on the side of the government, convincing the people that this was a good tax since it was progressive and very easy to collect."</p>
<p>The problem was compounded by the average Filipino's lack of trust in the government, a legacy of the years of martial law under late President Ferdinand Marcos.</p>
<p>"Due to our recent history there is a level of distrust when it to the government. So, I think people need a non-partisan group with a long-term perspective," Bernardo said.</p>
<p>He said Filipinos needed to be fully informed about the reform programme without bias or prejudice. To this end the foundation would organise public policy forums and discussions with opinion-makers.</p>
<p>Founding members include Monetary Board member Cayetano Paderanga, political analyst Alex Magno, Dante Canlas and Raphael Lotilla, deputy director-generals of National Economic and Development Authority, and Gloria Tan-Climaco, a former president of auditors SGV &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Its advisers include former prime minister Cesar Virata, former finance secretary Ramon del Rosario, former energy secretary Delfin Lazaro, and Bernardo Villegas, dean of the School of Business at Manila's University of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>"This is a group of people who want to help those who stay in the government from getting frustrated," Bernardo said.</p>
<p>"You need this kind of group that would bolster the reformers in government to take long-term views," he added.</p>
