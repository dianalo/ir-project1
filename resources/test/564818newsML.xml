<p>Israel cancelled a ceremony on Tuesday in memory of seven Israeli girls killed by a Jordanian soldier after Jordan announced Crown Prince Hassan would not be attending.</p>
<p>"All events scheduled to take place today at Naharayim have been postponed until further notice," the Government Press Office (GPO) said in a statement. It did not elaborate.</p>
<p>On Monday, the GPO had said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the prince would speak at the ceremony at the Jordan-Israel border and hold diplomatic talks.</p>
<p>But a Jordanian palace official later said the prince had never agreed to attend and would not participate.</p>
<p>Israel Radio on Tuesday said the prince had refused to meet Netanyahu because of a dispute over water distribution under the peace treaty signed between the two countries in 1994.</p>
<p>However, opposition Labour party lawmaker Yossi Beilin, one of the architects of peace deals by Israel's prior government with the Palestinians, was to meet the prince in Amman on Tuesday, the radio said.</p>
<p>Beilin is pushing an initiative to restart Israel-Palestinian peace talks. Netanyahu's spokesmen have said Beilin has no right to conduct negotiations for Israel.</p>
<p>The ceremony in memory of the March 13 killing was to have been held at a beauty spot on Jordanian soil leased to Israeli farmers under the peace treaty. Israel calls the area Naharayim as well as the Island of Peace. It is called Baqoura in Jordan.</p>
<p>The girls' parents were to dedicate a "hill of flowers" and plant trees at the site on Tuesday, the GPO said.</p>
<p>Jordan's King Hussein paid a condolence call on the victims' families after the attack and expressed shame at the massacre.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's media adviser David Bar-Illan had told Israel Radio on Monday issues to be discussed at the meeting included building a joint airport on the Red Sea, diverting Jordan River water to Jordan, tourism projects at the Dead Sea and other industry and trade issues.</p>
<p>But new Israeli ambassador to Amman, Oded Eran, told the radio there was disenchantment in Jordan over the three-year-old peace accord with Israel and expectations of "more tangible" economic results.</p>
