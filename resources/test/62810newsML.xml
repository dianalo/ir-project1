<p>China is looking for a far smaller quantity of soybeans than said in rumours which helped pushed world soybean prices higher in Chicago, Far East oilseed traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It was overblown," a Singapore source said about rumours which swept the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) exchange on Tuesday that China was seeking 200,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans for October/November shipment.</p>
<p>This helped soybean contracts close firmer, with November up three cents to US$7.96 a bushel.  </p>
<p>"The market doesn't believe it," the trader said, adding that the market price had already moved down.</p>
<p>At 07.00 GMT, the CBOT November soybean contract was quoted at $7.91 a bushel on the exchange's after-hours Project A trading system in Asia, down 4-3/4 cents from Chicago's open outcry close.</p>
<p>"There are a few inquiries but they don't total more than 50,000 tonnes," the Singapore trader said of Chinese interest.</p>
<p>The biggest lot inquired after was 20,000 tonnes, he said, with one for 15,000 tonnes, and two smaller lots.  </p>
<p>Prices were still a good $20 away from what Chinese buyers were willing to pay, traders said, citing inquiries at $315-$320 a tonne C&amp;F.</p>
<p>"If you look at the C&amp;F price today, the Chinese can't afford it," another trading source said.</p>
<p>"The Chinese would be in the market if the price was $315-320 (a tonne)" rather than current values around $335-$340, he said, adding that he had sold a 50,000-tonne cargo of soybeans to China, which discharged last week, at $320 a tonne, and had another Panamax on the way in the same price range.  </p>
<p>Prices released on Wednesday by Shanghai's National Grains and Oils Information Centre show grade two soybeans in Jilin at 3,150 yuan ($379) a tonne, grade three beans in Heilongjiang, the major growing region, at 3,130 yuan ($377) a tonne.</p>
<p>"So if today a Panamax is $335-$340, plus three percent import duty, and a 13 percent VAT (value-added tax), it's a lot of money and doesn't make sense," the trader added.</p>
<p>China was generally perceived by traders as in need of soybeans imports before year end, but price would be the key.</p>
<p>-- Hong Kong newsroom (852) 2843-6470  </p>
<p>China's June customs figures available in Hong Kong show soybean imports in the first half of 1996 at just 120,000 tonnes, with 20,000 tonnes arriving in June.</p>
<p>Traders, however, put year-to-date soybean imports at 700,000 tonnes, with one saying that as the import window closes with the approach of China's domestic new crop, maximum imports for the remainder of the year would be 150,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>"China's new crop is coming on and so right now, bean imports just don't make sense," a third source said.</p>
<p>The current cash price for soybeans in China was 3,300 yuan ($397) a tonne, he said.</p>
