<p>Nebraska feedlot cattle bids at $110.00 per cwt on a dressed basis were passed by owners pricing cattle at $112.00, market sources said.</p>
<p>The bulk of cattle last week sold at $109.00, although there were a few late Friday at $110.00, they said.</p>
<p>There were no reported bids on a live basis, with cattle seen priced from $69.00 to $70.00.</p>
<p>Fed cattle prices this week were expected to be underpinned by smaller numbers of market-ready cattle and strong packer demand. This week's showlist was estimated near 68,600 head, down 12,900 from last week, they said.</p>
<p>Last week's snowstorm and unseasonably cold temperatures hindered weight gains on cattle, spurring some owners to hold them back another week to recover following the storm, the market sources said.</p>
