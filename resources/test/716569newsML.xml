<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hogs Thursday were seen steady to $0.50 per cwt lower, pressured by expected lower bids from packers who continue to lose on their margins, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>Packer margins remained deep in the red as weak pork prices offset potential benefit from lower cash hog prices this week, the dealers said.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hogs on Thursday were seen steady to $0.50 lower at $59.00 to $59.50 for hogs delivered to the plant, livestock dealers said.  </p>
<p>Illinois top prices for hogs at the plant were expected steady to $0.50 lower at $58.50 to $59.00.</p>
<p>Indidan/Ohio top prices at the plant were expected off $0.50 at $59.00, they said.</p>
<p>Declines in the eastern Corn Belt could steepen on projections for lighter demand amid news that Indiana Packers Corp would not slaughter on Friday at its Delphi, Ind., plant because of scheduled maintenance.</p>
<p>The plant will resume slaughter on Monday, said Ed Nelson, the company's vice president. About 10,000 to 12,000 hogs are slaughtered each day at the plant, Nelson said.</p>
