<p>NYCE frozen concentrated orange juice futures maintained their recent dull tone amid a dearth of news, balanced technicals, and a lack of interest from players, market sources said.</p>
<p>Support and resistance levels were unchanged at 97.50 and 102.50 cents a lb, respectively, basis the January contract.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 900 lots.</p>
<p>The most-active January contract settled 0.60 cent a lb higher at 99.75, having ranged from 100.25 to 99.10. The back months finished 0.55 and 0.50 firmer.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes said the market should maintain its current trading range until colder weather reaches the Florida citrus belt.</p>
<p>She also said the aggressive industry promotion of ready to serve orange juice from concentrate, could boost movement in the coming season, and help absorb the larger crop.</p>
