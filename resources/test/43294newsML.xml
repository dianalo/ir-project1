<p>British scientists said on Tuesday they were starting experiments that could help doctors communicate with people in comas.</p>
<p>Steve Roberts and colleagues at London's Imperial College of Science and Technology said he hoped to use a "hairnet" of electrodes, connected to a computer, to "read" an unconscious person's thoughts.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of people who have had severe injury, come out of coma and tell of a nightmare situation of being conscious of their surroundings but utterly unable to communicate in any way," Roberts told a news conference.</p>
<p>"It is hoped in a lot of these cases patients will be able to respond to this analysis and we would be able to assist their rehabilitation out of coma. There's even a glimmer of hope that we might be able to say "there's someone in there,' which will be of some comfort to the patient."</p>
<p>Roberts, speaking at the British Association for the Advancement of Science annual festival in Birmingham, said he had already done tests on conscious volunteers in which the computer predicted, with 80 percent accuracy, when they were about to move their fingers.</p>
<p>Roberts said he could ask the coma patients to think about moving a finger. If they could hear, they could think and the computer could pick this up. It could be used to set up a simple "yes or no" type of communication system, he said.</p>
<p>Earlier studies have already shown that the brain "rehearses" movement and the same part of the brain is activated whether a person actually moves or just thinks about it.</p>
<p>Roberts said he now planned to test comatose patients, if he could get permission from hospitals and families.</p>
<p>The technology could also be used to create futuristic controls for a jetfighter, already imagined by the writers of adventure films.</p>
<p>The pilot could just think about making a move and the aircraft would instantly respond.</p>
<p>"One life-preserving aid could be a way of enabling, say, a fighter pilot who physically can't move to operate his ejector seat. Clearly being able to think about ejecting, and enable it to happen, would help a pilot in a high-G spin."</p>
<p>Roberts' work is being funded by Britain's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.</p>
