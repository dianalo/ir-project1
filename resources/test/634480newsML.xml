<p>Chemicals company Perstorp AB on Tuesday forecast that its full year profit would fall by about 27 percent after posting a 21 percent drop in pre-tax profit for the first eight months.</p>
<p>Perstorp forecast a pre-tax profit of 500-550 million crowns after restructuring costs for the year ending September 30, 1997, compared to a pre-tax profit of 716 million crowns in the same period a year earlier.  </p>
<p>For the eight months to April 30, Perstorp reported a pre-tax profit of 362 million crowns against 456 million crowns a year earlier.</p>
<p>"On the whole business conditions and demand were strong during the period in North America and Asia, where the positive trend for chemicals and flooring products continued," Perstorp said.</p>
<p>"In Europe, there have been signs of an improved business climate in recent months, but demand continues to be weak, particularly in construction and plastic-related operations."</p>
<p>Perstorp said the situation in the chemicals market was more varied.</p>
<p>The company said the sale of Perstorp Components and Perstorp Analytical cut operating income in the eight months to 7.78 billion crowns from 8.55 billion but its continuing operations posted a favourable volume increase.  </p>

<p>Perstorp said for the full year, its current operations were expected to report improved earnings before non-recurring items compared with a year ago, forecasting a pre-tax profit to about 550-550 million crowns.</p>
<p>"However the net of capital gains and restructuring measures, in a total amount of about 125 million crowns ($16 million), will have a negative impact on full-year earnings, as will a reduction in positive currency effect compared with the preceding year," Perstorp said.</p>
<p>This forecast corresponded to earnings per share of 6.98-7.68 crowns, down from 10.00 crowns a year earlier.</p>
<p>"The group's cost cutting and rationalisation programme is expected to have a positive impact on earnings as of the next fiscal year," Perstorp said.</p>
<p>It was referring to a programme to cut costs by 500 million crowns over a three year period and to organise the company into three divisions; Perstorp Chemicals, Perstorp Surfaces and Perstorp Plastics Systems in addition to the business development company Pernovo.</p>
<p>At 1150 GMT Perstorp shares were two crowns lower at 123 crowns.</p>
