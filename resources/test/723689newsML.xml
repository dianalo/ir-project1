<p>New Zealand share prices ended higher on Friday despite a warning from the Reserve Bank that monetary conditions were too loose.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index closed 9.64 points stronger at 2,516.84, with all leading stocks firmer.</p>
<p>An unexpectedly large current account deficit for the March quarter, released this morning, caused a sharp fall in the New Zealand dollar and a spike higher in short interest rates.</p>
<p>That saw monetary conditions ease to a point that the Reserve Bank, which wants to keep underlying inflation between zero and three percent, could not tolerate.  </p>
<p>"Overall monetary conditions have settled too far from the Reserve Bank's desired monetary conditions," governor Don Brash warned the markets.</p>
<p>But the statement, released 40 minutes before session's end, was largely ignored in the equity market.</p>
<p>"It was end of the day, people were finishing up orders, and the market tended to ignore those comments," said Craig Robins at County Natwest.</p>
<p>But he said the market may react to the comments next week.  </p>
<p>"Obviously the Reserve Bank is signalling slightly tighter conditions are more desirable, so I think we'll get more of a consolidation than we've had."</p>
<p>Lion Nathan stood out on the day, rising six cents to $3.88. Brokers said the rise reflected a better outlook for the brewer's Australian operations, which account for about 70 percent of its earnings.</p>
<p>Fletcher Energy continued its good recent run, rising a further 10 cents to $4.85, but FCL Forest came under pressure and ended eight cents weaker at $2.02.</p>
