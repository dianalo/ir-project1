<headline>CRICKET - Rixon confident Kiwis will make Cup final.</headline>
<text>
<p>AUCKLAND, May 2 - New Zealand cricket coach Steve Rixon is confident his side will make the final of the limited-overs Independence Cup tournament in India, NZPA reported on Friday.</p>
<p>The Stephen Fleming-led New Zealanders fly to India on Sunday in a confident frame of mind despite having strike bowler Simon Doull last night ruled out of the trip with a stress fracture to his back.</p>
<p>Rixon was upbeat about the Kiwis' chances, rejecting suggestions they would be the tournament underdogs against Sri Lanka, Pakistan and India.  </p>
<p>"I don't know if we're underdogs, we've played Sri Lanka four times and only been beaten once so I'd suggest we'd got their measure," Rixon said.</p>
<p>"We've played Pakistan, we know we can beat Pakistan, and we haven't seen India.</p>
<p>"But I'm confident of doing well, I expect to be in the final.</p>
<p>"We've played good enough one-day cricket in the past few years to stand up tall in one-day cricket and the last time we played, we beat Sri Lanka."  </p>
<p>Rixon said the squad's month-long break from cricket could also help them, as their opponents have been playing continuously over the last few months.</p>
<p>"We'll go over there fresh, they (India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) could be a little jaded. The Sri Lankans have had fair bit of cricket, as have the Pakistanis. The Indians have been involved in a lot of cricket too," he said.</p>
<p>"We'll be refreshed at the tournament so I'm expecting us to go really, really well. The guys have had a good break, they'll go over there looking to pick up where they left off."  </p>
<p>Rixon said that even though the domestic season had ended some time ago, a lot of the players had still managed to get in some games.</p>
<p>"I don't think we're going to be that much behind the eight ball. Stephen Fleming's been playing since the end of the season, as have Chris Harris and Nathan Astle who are playing in England," Rixon said.</p>
<p>"Matt Horne's had a couple of games and Daniel Vettori's also played a few games."</p>
