<p>Isolde Kostner emulated compatriot Deborah Compagnoni and continued Italy's sweep of the women's gold medals at the Alpine skiing world championships on Tuesday by retaining her super-giant slalom title.</p>
<p>Kostner clocked one minute 23.50 seconds down the Kandahar-Banchetta piste to beat Germany's Olympic downhill and former world super-G champion Katja Seizinger by 0.08 seconds.</p>
<p>Germany's Hilde Gerg was third in 1:23.64.</p>
<p>It was Italy's third gold in three women's races and the host nation moved to the top of the medals table.</p>
<p>Kostner, who won gold last year in the southern Spanish resort of Sierra Nevada, also became the second Italian woman in as many races to retain a world title after Compagnoni won the slalom last week and retained her giant title on Sunday.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old Kostner also has a very real chance of winning again in Saturday's downhill. She has won three World Cup downhills in her career to just one super-G.</p>
<p>Before 1996, when Italy won a total of four golds, no Italian woman had won a recognised world championship race.</p>
<p>Remarkably, Kostner made up 0.40 seconds in the final stages after a slow start when she trailed Seizinger's time.</p>
<p>Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, winner of two World Cup super-Gs this season, was well down the field.</p>
<p>She finished in 1:24.47 after losing time coming off the final jump and skiing wide of the racing line earlier.</p>
<p>"I made a big mistake on one of the last turns," the Swede said. "I really blew it."</p>
