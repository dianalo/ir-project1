<p>Indian Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said on Friday this week's U.S. missile attacks on Iraq were "highly regrettable" and urged Washington to refrain from more attacks.</p>
<p>"It is highly regrettable. We call upon the United States to refrain from any other attacks on Iraq and to respect its sovereignty and integrity," Gujral told parliament.  </p>
<p>"The government of India is unable to accept the justification for the U.S. bombing," Gujral said.</p>
<p>U.S. forces fired a total of 44 cruise missiles at air defence targets in southern Iraq on Tuesday and Wednesday. The attacks were prompted by the Iraqi army's incursion into Kurdish areas in northern Iraq on Saturday.</p>
<p>Gujral said India was also worried by the attacks because they affected India's economic interest and those of Indian workers employed in Gulf region.</p>
<p>"These developments have also had an impact on India. The oil price has gone up," he said.</p>
<p>"We are watching the situation very closely and are also in touch with friendly countries," he said.</p>
