<p>Corruption is rampant in Malaysia's housing industry and is the main reason for the rising cost of houses, the Federation of Malaysian Consumer Associations (Fomca) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Fomca President Hamdan Adnan told the national news agency Bernama a federation study showed at least 30 percent of the cost of houses was due to red tape which in turn was due to "people waiting for their palms to be greased".</p>
<p>"Our study shows that many (government housing officials) are driving luxury cars well beyond their income," Hamdan said.</p>
<p>"I am told that there's tremendous cutting of corners among developers. These developers are probably doing so because they are under pressure to make pay-offs to people who have the authority to approve or expedite this and that.</p>
<p>"The end result is that it's the consumers who are paying for the corruption in the industry," said Hamdan who appealed to the government to act against malpractices in the industry as part of its current anti-corruption drive, Bernama reported.</p>
<p>The federation president's comments coincide with a high-profile campaign by acting Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to weed out corruption.</p>
<p>Four state politicians and a deputy federal minister have been sacked over the last two weeks as the campaign gathered momentum. Several others are under investigation by the Anti-Corruption Agency.</p>
