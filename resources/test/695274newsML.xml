<p>Xircom Inc said Monday it has completed the sale of Netaccess Inc, the company's remote access unit, to Brooktrout Technology Inc for $11 million.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement it will realize net cash proceeds of $9 million, including future tax benefits retained by Xircom, from the sale and will record a loss from discontinued operations of $0.27 cents a share.</p>
<p>"With the closing of this transaction we have completed the two corporate goals we established at the outset of this quarter -- to bring the PC Card channel inventory back into our target range and to divest the Netaccess business unit," said Dirk Gates, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We are exiting this quarter having accomplished both strategic goals and are focused 100 percent on the rapidly growing market for PC Card communications products."</p>
