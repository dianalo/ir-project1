<headline>Calif. Assembly OKs bill for levy repairs, ballpark.</headline>

<text>
<p>California's state Assembly approved legislation on Monday that would speed levy repairs statewide and help San Francisco build a new ballpark, lawmakers said.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 181, by Senator Quentin Kopp, was approved by the state Assembly on a vote of 71-to-1. The bill now advances to the Senate, which could vote on the measure on Thursday.</p>
<p>The bill would provide targeted exemptions from the California Environmental Quality Act to speed flood-damage repairs in the state, lawmakers said.  </p>
<p>The bill would provide similar exemptions to a proposed major league ballpark for the San Francisco Giants. Proponents of the bill said it would speed the ballpark construction timeline by three to four months.</p>
<p>Last year, San Francisco voters approved construction of the ballpark, which is scheduled to open in April of 2000. The ballpark will cost about $255 million to build. The financing package includes $10 million in tax increment financing by the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency.</p>
