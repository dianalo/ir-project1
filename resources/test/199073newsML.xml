<p>Alcoa Manufacturing (Great Britain) Ltd said on Tuesday it was restructuring its Waunarlwydd Works facility in Swansea, Wales, in a move that will result in a 25 percent reduction in production capacity.</p>
<p>About 100 jobs will be eliminated in the restructuring, the company said. The reduction will take place by year-end.</p>
<p>Alcoa Manufacturing (Great Britain) is a unit of Aluminum Co of America, the world's largest aluminum company.  </p>
<p>Paul Thomas, the unit's managing director, said, "This restructuring, along with the recently announced addition of a low-cost scrap remelting facility on the plantsite, is vital to maintaining AMGB's position as Europe's lowest cost and only dedicated producer of aluminum end and tab stock."</p>
