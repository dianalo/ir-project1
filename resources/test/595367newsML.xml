<p>President Bill Clinton on Monday said he planned to renew most favoured nation trade status (MFN) for China, firing the opening shot in what is expected to be a new foreign policy battle with Congress.</p>
<p>Speaking to businessmen at the White House, Clinton said he had decided to accord China what amounts to normal trade status for the coming year despite his disagreements with Beijing on many issues, notably its human rights record.</p>
<p>"Our broad policy is engagement. That doesn't mean that we win every point, but it means we work together when we can and we're honest in our disagreements when they exist," he said.</p>
<p>"I believe if we were to revoke normal trade status it would cut off our contact with the Chinese people and undermine our influence with the Chinese government."</p>
<p>MFN gives China the normal trade status that the United States accords all but a handful of nations including Cuba, Vietnam and North Korea.</p>
<p>The move to renew China's MFN status, an annual decision that every president has made since 1980, was expected to be controversial in Congress, where some legislators have made clear their intention to overturn the decision.</p>
<p>Under the law, Clinton must formally inform Congress of his decision by June 3. The House of Representatives and the Senate, to overturn the decision, have until Aug. 31 to pass a joint resolution disapproving it.</p>
<p>If Clinton were to veto such a resolution, both chambers would then have to muster a two-thirds majority to override his veto and prevail in the annual policy battle.</p>
<p>Clinton, who has agreed to a summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin later this year, has worked hard to improve ties with Beijing over the past two years.</p>
<p>But China's human rights record, its sale of missiles and technology to regions that are becoming unstable and its huge trade surplus with the United States remain problems.</p>
<p>Defending his decision, Clinton argued that the United States had an interest in China's political and economic reform and would have little sway over the country if it were to curtail its trade status.</p>
<p>"The United States has a huge stake in the continued emergence of China in a way that is open economically and stable politically," he said. "Of course we hope that it will come to respect human rights more and the rule of law more."</p>
<p>There is also a big economic incentive for the United States to continue normal trade relations with China, a large market for U.S. products.</p>
<p>"There are those who believe that our differences are so profound...our position would be more likely to prevail if we cut off all trade contacts," he said. "I believe that is wrong, and we're going to have a big debate about it in the Congress."</p>
<p>Many in the United States -- including administration officials, lawmakers and businessmen -- are also concerned about the future of Hong Kong when control of the British colony reverts to Beijing on July 1.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers have suggested MFN be delayed or be renewed for a shorter time, such as three months or so, until they can see how China handles Hong Kong. Critics say Beijing has already begun to erode political rights there.</p>
<p>Administration officials and private analysts are reasonably confident Clinton can prevent his opponents from mustering the votes needed to override his MFN decision.</p>
<p>But few doubt the battle will be bruising. Clinton and his top aides had a hard time recently securing another of their key foreign policy goals of 1997 -- Senate ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.</p>
