<p>Bulgaria's Balkan airline will resume its regular flights to the Gulf from December 21 after cancelling them last month, newspapers said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The new board of directors of debt-ridden Balkan has decided to resume the flights from Sofia to Kuwait, Bahrain and Dubai as planes flying to these destinations were always full, newspapers quoted airline officials as saying.</p>
<p>In an effort to reduce its losses, Balkan's previous management decided to cut some flights as 34 of its 59 international routes were loss-making, officials said.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry replaced the board last month and appointed Valeri Doganov as the airline's executive director.</p>
