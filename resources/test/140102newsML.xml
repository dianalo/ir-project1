<p>Brazil rejected World Bank criticism of the South American Mercosur customs union, saying a new study which branded the bloc as "artificial" and "protectionist" was out of date.</p>
<p>"The World Bank should be a little more rigorous in drawing up its analyses," Jose Botafogo, Undersecretary for Trade and Economic Integration at the Foreign Ministry, told reporters. A World Bank study found the four-nation bloc -- comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- helped trade and investment among members but mostly benefitted sectors unable to compete elsewhere, like the auto industry.  </p>
<p>Botafogo said the study, which appeared on Wednesday, did not take into consideration any developments after 1994 and as such was out of date.</p>
<p>"The period and and the products analysed refer to a phase that has been completely finished," he said.</p>
<p>Exports from non-Mercosur countries entering the union totalled $55.168 billion in 1995, up from $25.060 billion in 1990, "testimony to the open and non-exclusive nature of the bloc," a Foreign Ministry statement said.  </p>
<p>The statement also challenged a criticism included the World Bank study that dynamic trade in capital goods had been restricted to within the Mercosur group.</p>
<p>In the case of Brazil, capital goods accounted for 18 percent of exports to Mercosur members, but 20.7 percent of exports to the United States, Canada and Mexico, it said.</p>
<p>Botafogo said existing barriers to free trade within Mercosur were consistent with World Trade Organization rules and that steps were being taken to match developed countries.</p>
<p>"This process of liberalization has to be done gradually to allow highly inefficient economies to turn into efficient ones," he said.</p>
