<p>A leading British business group urged the new Labour government on Tuesday to ensure that the country's flexible labour market was not undermined by its decision to sign up to the European Union social chapter.</p>
<p>"Entry into the Social Chapter must not result in the opening of the flood gates of social legislation from do-gooding bureaucrats in Brussels," said David Richardson, president of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).</p>
<p>"Government will have to work assiduously to ensure that we retain the advantages of a flexible labour market in the UK and indeed across Europe."</p>
<p>Opening the group's annual conference, Richardson said businesses were also very concerned about the introduction of a national minimum wage.</p>
<p>"On the minimum wage, business is concerned not so much about the principle but more about the practical impact of such a measure. The level at which the minimum wage is set is all important and that is why the role of the Low Pay Commission will be crucial to the outcome of this exercise," he said.</p>
<p>The new government will establish an independent Low Pay Commission, including business and union representatives, which will recommend a level for the minimum wage.</p>
<p>Turning to the economy, Richardson said new Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown may have to raise taxes in his forthcoming mini-budget to slow down consumer spending.</p>
<p>"The Chancellor may well need to take some of the heat out of the consumer demand in this forthcoming budget by making modest but effective adjustments to personal taxation," he said.</p>
<p>He also urged the government to improve the quality of the debate on a single European currency.</p>
<p>If the government were to sign up in 1999, British business would be at a disadvantage "due to the unwillingness of the last government to help in forward planning and dissemination of information about the impact," Richardson said.</p>
