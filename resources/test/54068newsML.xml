<headline>Indonesia's Megawati said on travel blacklist.</headline>

<p>Indonesian opposition figurehead Megawati Sukarnoputri was briefly stopped at a Jakarta airport on Saturday after being told she was banned from travelling abroad, advisers said.</p>
<p>"This morning she was going to leave for Singapore for the weekend but the immigration officers said she was not allowed to leave the country as she had been blacklisted," Kwik Kian Gie, a Megawati adviser, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Sources say they were told by Megawati that a computer screen showed she was blacklisted when she tried to pass the immigration barrier.</p>
<p>Megawati, ousted leader of the Indonesian Democractic Party (PDI), has been questioned three times by authorities since the July 27 riots in Jakarta which were sparked when police seized party headquarters from her loyalist supporters.</p>
<p>At least four people died and scores of buildings and vehicles were set ablaze in the riots, the worst in the capital in more than 20 years.</p>
<p>Megawati, the daughter of late founding president Sukarno, had become a symbol of dissent after she was ousted by a government-backed faction of the PDI in June.</p>
<p>An immigration officer at Jakarta's Sukarno-Hatta Airport told Reuters she was later allowed to leave for Singapore.</p>
<p>"She has already departed. She did not have any problems," an immigration official, who identified himself as Lim, told Reuters.</p>
<p>But another Megawati adviser Mucthar Buchori said she was allowed to depart after insisting she be shown the written instruction banning her from overseas travel.</p>
<p>"There was no written instruction and she insisted on seeing the written instruction. They could not show it, so they let her go finally but she was on the computer screen (as being blacklisted)," Buchori told Reuters.</p>
<p>Kwik said she was booked on an early morning flight to Singapore due to depart around 7 a.m. (0000 GMT) from Jakarta's Sukarno-Hatta International Airport.</p>
<p>He said Megawati had planned to take a couple of days rest in the neighbouring island state.</p>
<p>"In such cases the person should be told in advance. They should be told immediately. But it was not the case with Megawati. She just knew it this morning at the counter of the immigration," Kwik told Reuters.</p>
<p>Indonesia's director-general of immigration Pranowo said in February that in 1995 2,066 foreigners were barred from entering Indonesia and 680 Indonesians were forbidden to leave the country.</p>
<p>The immigration office can ban people for violating immigration laws, attorney-general bans people wanted by police, the finance minister bans those wanted for tax offences and the armed forces chief bans people for political reasons.</p>
<p>Of the 680 banned last year, Pranowo said 542 were banned by Attorney-General, 104 by the finance minister and 34 by the immigration department and none by the armed forces.</p>
