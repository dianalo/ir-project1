<p>Norland Medical Systems Inc said on Tuesday it had formed a collaborative marketing agreement with Eli Lilly and Co for its high-resolution micro-scanner.</p>
<p>Norland said in a statement it sold a prototype of its peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography technology, used to research bone disease treatments.  In return, Norland said it received a license to use certain software developed by Lilly which improved the scanner's resolution.  </p>
<p>"The Lilly software enhances the resolution of the Norland scanner and we hope to sell the scanner with the software," a Norland spokesman said.</p>
<p>Norland Chairman and President said in a statement: "I hope that this agreement will lead to more powerful tools which will enable researchers to speed up the selection of therapies against osteoporosis."</p>
<p>The company declined to give a financial value for the agreement.</p>
