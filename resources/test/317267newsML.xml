<p>Embattled Deutsche Morgan Grenfell was preparing on Sunday to launch an intensive campaign to shore up its pension fund business as former fund manager Nicola Horlick continued to argue she had done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>The investment banking arm of Germany's mighty Deutsche Bank is to meet key clients, but DMG spokesman James Murray denied pension firms were considering moving from its 18 billion pound ($30.11 billion) funds.</p>
<p>"We've had absolutely no indication that our institutional pension fund clients have plans at this stage to move their business," he said.</p>
<p>Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), the fund management arm of DMG, has already written to all its pension fund clients to limit any fall-out from the suspension and later resignation last week of senior British fund manager Horlick.</p>
<p>Some clients, including London's Westminster City Council, Scotland's Dumfries and Galloway County Council and the Merchant Navy Officers' Pension Fund, have expressed individual concern about recent events at MGAM.</p>
<p>And the Railway Pension Trustee Company, which has 1.25 billion pounds with MGAM, said it had met MGAM officials and would be in close contact with its asset managers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Horlick, who was suspended at MGAM for allegedly trying to lure staff with her to another firm, continued to deny the accusations.</p>
<p>"I think my colleagues know that's not the case," she told BBC television as reporters swarmed around her on Sunday.</p>
<p>Horlick was suspended from the firm only days after she had been promoted to managing director at MGAM.</p>
<p>Her subsequent resignation as head of MGAM's British pension fund business and dramatic dash to Frankfurt on Friday to plead with Deutsche Bank for her reinstatement received widespread coverage in British media.</p>
<p>"These people who I spoke to in Germany were very, very serious about all of this. And I want to give them a chance to sort this out," Horlick said on BBC television.</p>
<p>"What I really want is a proper resolution. And I still think that that means either reinstatement -- and I mean that, I like doing my job. Reinstatement or compensation," she added.</p>
<p>MGAM is still trying to regain an even keel after last year's revelations of irregularities at three of its retail investment funds, the sacking of fund manager Peter Young, a 180 million pound cash injection to bolster the funds and the announcement of a 200 million pound compensation package.</p>
<p>Young, who denies any involvement in criminal activity, is now under investigation by Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO).</p>
<p>Much of the media coverage of Horlick's case has focused on the "human interest" angle with pictures of the 35-year-old -- dubbed Superwoman by British newspapers -- with her children at their luxury home in Kensington, west London.</p>
<p>Fund management sources said Horlick, who stated she managed between three-and-a-half and four billion pounds worth of the firm's business, had talked about a management buy-out.</p>
<p>But they said that even if this had been discussed informally it would have had no hope of success as DMG, along with many other firms, was keen to build its strength in this lucrative area and would not dismantle its business.</p>
<p>Horlick, who during a whirlwind campaign on Friday entered MGAM's London headquarters in an attempt to meet management and loudly proclaimed "Justice will be done", has said she wants to settle her differences as quickly as possible and is pinning her hopes on further talks with a Deutsche legal official.</p>
