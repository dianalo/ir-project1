<p>Mobil Australia Ltd, a unit of Mobil Corp, said on Monday its profit after tax and interest rose slightly to A$75.4 million in calendar 1996 from A$73.7 million the previous year.</p>
<p>A Mobil spokesman said the company was happy it had been able to increase profit, but said the result represented an unsatisfactory return on capital of about three percent.</p>
<p>Mobil Australia has an asset base of about A$2.6 billion.</p>
<p>"We put in place some business initiatives over 1996 which meant we were able to offset the impact of very poor refining margins and very poor marketing margins," the spokesman said.  </p>
<p>"(But) the net effect is that those business initiatives have been wiped away by what has happened in the marketplace to margins," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>"It reflects what is a very tough competitive environment."</p>
<p>British Petroleum Co Plc unit BP Australia earlier this month reported a 38 percent fall in net profit in calendar 1996 to A$124 million.</p>
<p>Mobil owns 700 retail petrol sites in Australian and supplies a further 1,800 through its Melbourne refinery.</p>
