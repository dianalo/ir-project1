<p>Venezuelan paints and packaging company Corimon now trades on the Caracas stock exchange under the tickers  CRMa.CR and  CRMb.CR, the Caracas bolsa said.</p>
<p>The A and B shares are the fruit of a financial restructuring that left the company's former common stocks as A shares, and securitized debt now traded as preferred B shares.</p>
<p>Corimon A shares, which began trading Monday in Caracas after an eight-month suspension, will also trade on the New York Stock Exchange when the New York ban is lifted, the bolsa said.</p>
<p>The company currently has 1,111,056,490 A shares and 2,601,471,718 B shares outstanding, each at a nominal ten bolivars.</p>
<p>A shares rose 0.10 bolivars to close at 18.10 in Tuesday's session, while B shares dropped to 12.75 after opening at 16.50 bolivars.</p>
