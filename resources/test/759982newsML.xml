<p>Despite rising expectations that the United States will resume export subsidies for wheat flour, an subsidized sale could still be some time away, a U.S. Agriculture Department aide said Monday.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman confirmed that the Clinton administration was reviewing whether to resume wheat flour and barley malt export subsidies to help U.S. exporters regain lost market share.</p>
<p>But nearly three weeks later, no decision has been made and some administration agencies continue to question "whether or not it's really needed," the USDA aide said.</p>
<p>The same skeptics are also concerned that resuming export subsidies for wheat flour and barley malt increases the chance that the United State will take the much bigger step of subsidizing wheat exports, the aide said.</p>
<p>The United States has not subsidized wheat exports since July 1995 due to tight domestic grain supplies.</p>
<p>However, USDA currently forecasts 1997/98 U.S. wheat ending stocks at their highest level in six years because of a large winter wheat crop. That has helped fuel speculation that the department may resume wheat export subsidies sometime in 1997/98 to bolster prices and keep U.S. supplies moving.</p>
<p>But whether USDA takes that step will depend on a number of factors, including the final size of the U.S. wheat harvest and foreign wheat production.</p>
<p>In the near-term, the chances are greater that USDA will resume export subsidies for wheat flour and barley malt to help U.S exporters regain market share lost to Europe.</p>
<p>To do that, USDA must get permission from the Clinton administration's interagency trade policy review group to issue an "invitation for bids" to exporters.</p>
<p>Until that happens, subsidized sales cannot take place -- even though USDA has already announced allocations for countries to buy up to 475,000 tonnes of wheat flour and 150,000 tonnes of barley malt under EEP in 1997/98.</p>
<p>Even then, issuing an invitation for bids is just "loading the gun," one wheat flour industry aide said.</p>
<p>It could be weeks or longer before USDA actually approved a subsidized wheat flour or barley malt sale, depending on how aggressively the European Union is operating its own export subsidy program, the aide said.</p>
<p>At this point, it's also unclear whether USDA would announce a decision to invite exporters to submit bids. The usual process would be just to inform exporters and "the word would get out" that way, the aide said.</p>
<p>But given market interest in the issue, USDA might make an announcement if a positive decision is made, he said.</p>
<p>The most likely beneficiaries of renewed U.S. wheat flour export subsidies would be Egypt and Yemen.</p>
<p>Both are former number-one U.S. markets which bought little or no wheat flour from the United States in 1996/97 because of increased competition from the European Union.</p>
