<p>Fresh-faced teen pop trio Hanson joined forces with veteran Irish rockers U2 to help boost first half music sales and profits at PolyGram NV , the Dutch company said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Group first half net profit slipped to 270 million guilders from 272 million a year earlier, with a strong music performance hit by increased operating losses from its film business.</p>
<p>"Despite challenging conditions in some of our markets, PolyGram's expertise in breaking new acts and promoting established artists is reflected in the first half results," PolyGram chief executive Alain Levy said in the statement.    </p>
<p>Sales at the music division rose to 3.94 billion guilders in the first half from 3.63 billion, with operating profit up to 522 million from 457 million.</p>
<p>Within the division pop sales increased by 10 percent to 2.99 billion, or 66 percent of first half sales.</p>
<p>The best selling album in the first half was "Pop" from U2, with over five million copies sold, while breakthrough act Hanson sold three million copies of their album "Middle of Nowhere", during the second quarter. Two albums from Italian singer Andrea Bocelli collectively sold 4.2 million copies over the first half.</p>
<p>In total nine albums sold over one million copies in the first half, compared to 15 in the first six months of 1996 when PolyGram released a bigger number of superstar albums.</p>
<p>Total unit sales for the top five albums in the first half of 1997 was 15 million compared to 13 million for the comparable period in 1996.</p>
<p>The company, 75-percent owned by Philips Electronics NV , said it had a strong second half music release schedule with albums from Bjork, Boyz II Men, Elton John, Metallica and LL Cool J.</p>
