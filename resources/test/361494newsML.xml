<p>The European Parliament on Thursday stepped back from censuring the European Commission over its handling of mad cow disease but deputies warned they might do so later.</p>
<p>A parliamentary committee of inquiry rejected an amendment by the Green Group calling for a motion of no-confidence in the Commission, the European Union's executive body.</p>
<p>It was one of 254 amendments to a report attacking the way the Commission had handled the 1996 mad cow crisis, which has seriously damaged the European beef industry, and suggesting reforms.</p>
<p>The committee's president said European citizens would be angry that the Parliament was not taking stronger action.</p>
<p>"It's very bad for the reputation of the Parliament. We have not used the opportunity offered by the committee of inquiry," German Christian Democrat Reimer Boege told reporters, adding that the parliament had lost two to three years in its fight to gain more power.</p>
<p>Boege, who had expected support from the parliament's two largest political groups -- the Socialists and Christian Democrats -- said that the vote showed that the committee had changed its mind due to domestic political pressure.</p>
<p>The European Commission had also lobbied strongly against a censure motion.</p>
<p>"The Commission was not happy to live under a guillotine until December 1997," Boege said, referring to a deadline for reform set by the Green Group.</p>
<p>A Commission spokesman declined comment until the full Parliament votes on the report on February 19.</p>
<p>Boege warned that some Euro MPs will now table separate censure motions.</p>
<p>Belgian Socialist Jose Happart, the most radical member of the committee, has already started collecting the required 63 votes in order to present an immediate vote of censure.</p>
<p>"We will keep up the pressure," Boege said, adding that the Commission must cooperate and change things.</p>
<p>The committee is calling for the creation of a public health protection unit, covering both human and animal health, independent of agricultural and industrial interests and controlled by the EU consumer affairs commissioner.</p>
<p>Commission President Jacques Santer told the inquiry in mid-January the Commission planned similar changes, due to be announced later this month.</p>
<p>The mad cow crisis erupted in March 1996 when Britain said that the cattle brain disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), could be linked to a fatal human equivalent. The EU reacted with a worldwide ban on British beef exports.</p>
