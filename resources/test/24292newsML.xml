<p>Far East gold traders thumped foreheads in frustration at the market's foot-dragging this week and forecast on Friday that next week would not be much better.</p>
<p>The Southeast Asian gold market was more or less a photo-fit picture of the previous week's position with activity slow and bullion prices trapped in a well-worn range awaiting a seasonal upturn in demand and prices into the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Singapore premiums for Australian kilo bars were quoted unchanged at between 25-45 cents an ounce over spot loco London prices, with South Korean and Indonesian-origin premiums also steady at 10-20 cents an ounce.</p>
<p>Singapore dealers said they were concerned that there had been a marked revival in offers to sell gold by South Korean traders, following the distress sales of recent months after the Seoul government's crackdown on bullion arbitrage trade.</p>
<p>"I was shocked to see these offers coming in again, though there's been no indication of price or volume. I dread to think what will happen to the premiums if the Koreans start selling in force," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Continued dishoarding of kilo-bars by Indonesian sources ahead of next year's presidential election has also kept a lid on premiums.</p>
<p>Gold closed down at $387.00/$387.50 an ounce in Hong Kong on Friday, versus New York's $387.60/$388 finish on Thursday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the precious metal eased on a report that the International Monetary Fund might sell some of its gold to reduce the debts of the poorest developing countries.</p>
<p>Easier silver prices mid-week helped keep spot gold locked in a $386-$389 an ounce range, dealers said, but they remained optimistic that the usual seasonal pick-up in jewellery fabrication demand would see gold at $395 by end-October.</p>
<p>"I still think we'll see gold at $395 by the end of October, in a retracement of the $418-$380 move we saw at the start of the year," one said.</p>
<p>Silver, basis the September contract on New York's Comex market, was expected to find support at between $5.12-$5.15 an ounce and meet resistance from $5.25-$5.30, they added.</p>
<p>September silver closed up $0.004 in New York on Thursday at $5.255 an ounce.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, the tael bar market saw sharp fluctuations in the carry over charge at the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society, and very small volumes transacted this week.</p>
<p>"There are so few people in the market that even small orders sent the carry over charge very high or low," said one Hong Kong-based dealer.</p>
<p>The U.S. holiday Labor Day holiday on Monday promises a slow start to precious metals trading next week, in a trend which is likely to continue, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said they expected the market to remain within a one-dollar range over the next few trading days, bouncing between $387 and $388 an ounce.</p>
