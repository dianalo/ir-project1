<p>Eighteen wives of African leaders opened talks in the Nigerian capital on Monday against the backdrop of civil war in Zaire to discuss how they can use their influence to bring peace to the world's poorest continent.</p>
<p>Nigerian military ruler General Sani Abacha said the meeting should focus on "conflict prevention and improving the deplorable economic conditions of our people because economic deprivation is one of the causes of conflicts in our continent."</p>
<p>Abacha said Africa must take its destiny in its hands by designing workable solutions to its numerous problems.</p>
<p>Dubbed "The first summit of African first ladies on peace," the meeting -- designed to promote peace in the continent -- is the brainchild of General Abacha's wife, Maryam.</p>
<p>"Our intention is not to duplicate the commendable efforts of African leaders in brokering peace," said Mrs Abacha, adding that the conference would work out practical ways of mending fences among warring African nations.</p>
<p>Africa's latest war is in Zaire where veteran strongman Mobutu Sese Seko looks about to lose his 32-year-old grip on power to Laurent Kabila's rebels.</p>
<p>The rebels said after failed peace talks on Sunday they would push on toward Zaire's capital Kinshasa while ailing Mobutu considers Kabila's demand for his immediate resignation.</p>
<p>Like most wars in Africa, the suffering is greatest for refugees, 91 of whom were killed in a stampede on a train in rebel-held northeast Zaire on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Abuja conference is being staged with backing from Nigeria's military government and according to foreign minister Tom Ikimi: "The major objective of the summit is to find ways women can be involved in conflict resolution in Africa."</p>
<p>Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with 100 million people, has itself been in crisis since 1993 when the army annulled a presidential election that would have ushered in democracy.</p>
<p>The Abacha government is shunned by Western nations and countries like South Africa over its slow pace of democratisation and alleged human rights violations.</p>
<p>Among the first ladies attending the meeting are those of Namibia, Angola, Niger, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Gabon, Burundi, Equitorial Guinea, Gambia, Guinea, Chad and Zambia. Others are Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Tanzania and the interim head of state of war-ravaged Liberia, Ruth Perry.</p>
<p>Organisation of African Unity (OAU) secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim, who arrived in Nigeria on Thursday for the conference, expressed support for the initiative.</p>
<p>"The OAU will do everything within its means to facilitate the success of the peace mission," he said.</p>
<p>Mrs Abacha, a 50-year-old mother of 11 children, said the summit was a result of the Beijing conference on Women of 1995. The Abuja conference ends on Wednesday.</p>
