<p>Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda said on Thursday that his government will soon take significant decisions to improve the climate for foreign investment even if it met with difficulties on the way.</p>
<p>"The economic reform process has generated considerable enthusiasm and opened up vast sectors of activity," Deve Gowda told an international business conference organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in Calcutta.</p>
<p>"Considerable progress has been achieved but we are aware of the pending issues at both the national and the state level which need to be addressed. We are determined to move forward even if at times the going gets to be tough."</p>
<p>Deve Gowda reiterated his government's resolve to attract $10 billion in foreign investment annually and promised a set of decisions to boost foreign investment before he left for a world economic summit at the Swiss city of Davos later this month.</p>
<p>Net foreign portfolio investment in India was $2.0 billion in 1995/96 (April-March). Foreign direct investment (FDI) was $2.13 billion.</p>
<p>A series of decisions in key areas, including infrastructure policy and telecommunications, could be expected in the coming fortnight, Deve Gowda said. Government policies would become more transparent, he added.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda's centre-left United Front coalition, which assumed power in June, endorsed a free-market programme launched by his predecessor P.V. Narasimha Rao of the Congress party in 1991.</p>
<p>But his efforts to attract private funds worth billions of dollars in infrastructure have met with some criticism from the opposition and his own coalition partners.</p>
<p>Labour unions and leftist allies have opposed efforts to open up a decades-old monopoly on insurance.</p>
<p>Foreign investors and analysts have criticised delays in laying out transparent policies and guidelines to attract private funds to build infrastructure facilities like roads, ports, power plants and telecommunications.</p>
<p>"Foreign investment will be encouraged in core and infrastructure sectors, export and high-tech areas," Deve Gowda said and cited recent measures as proof of his sincerity.</p>
<p>India recently added 16 industries to a list of areas where foreign investors would be allowed "automatic approval" to hold 51 percent stake in firms. It also allowed 74 percent foreign equity in nine areas for the first time.</p>
<p>A plan to privatise power distribution was in place, and a port privatisation policy was approved recently, Deve Gowda said.</p>
<p>The government was also committed to cutting import tariffs in line with its position in world trade forums, he added.</p>
<p>The prime minister, keen to avoid accusations of corruption faced by some Indian leaders, also promised measures to introduce transparency in government decisions soon.</p>
<p>"We are simplifying the procedures," he said. "In the next 15 days, more decisions will be taken."</p>
<p>In response to a question, he asserted that he wanted no industrialist to deal with him through middlemen -- a term widely used in India to describe political fixers and lobbyists aiding political corruption.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, I don't want any middleman as long as I am the PM (prime minister)," Deve Gowda told cheering industrialists.</p>
