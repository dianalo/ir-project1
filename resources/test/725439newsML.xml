<p>The Czech crown weakened sharply in morning trading, pushed lower by fears of the economic costs of major flooding in the north and eastern parts of the country and an easing of crown demand from abroad.</p>
<p>The crown opened near 18.9/mark, but quickly broke through the 19/mark support level before steadying around 19.05/mark.</p>
<p>"There has been another wave of foreign currency buying this morning and for the time being it seems that the interest to go short in the Czech crown is over," said Breta Tichanek of ING bank in Prague.  </p>
<p>Some dealers added that the economic costs of massive flooding in the eastern part of the country -- which some economists estimate may lower GDP by one percentage point -- are of great concern to the market.</p>
<p>Torrential rains helped push water levels last week to their highest in more than a century, flooding nearly one-third of the country and forcing several major firms, and hundreds of medium-sized, to halt or reduce output.</p>
<p>No official damage reports have been made, but some analysts estimate the costs could run as high as 100 billion crowns.</p>
