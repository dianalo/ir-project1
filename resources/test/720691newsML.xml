<p>Russia will maintain cooperation with the West despite opposition to the enlargement of NATO and it wants further integration with Western organisations, a minister said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Yevgeny Yasin, a former economy minister and now minister without portfolio, told a news conference Russia wanted to ensure NATO enlargement did not bring any negative results.</p>
<p>"At the same time, we will continue our policy of cooperation with Western countries and our partners in Eastern Europe," he said.</p>
<p>Yasin was attending the second Central and Eastern European Economic Summit in Salzburg, where NATO's invitation earlier this week for the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to join the alliance, and its possible impact on economic relations in the region, is a key topic of debate.</p>
<p>Russia, which has condemned the NATO decision, did not believe that NATO enlargment was a basis for strengthening regional security. Yasin said nothing he had heard from delegates had changed his view.</p>
<p>However, he said it was still very important for Russia to cooperate with international financial organisations.</p>
<p>"I am deeply convinced that for our country it is extremely important to join the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development soon," Yasin said.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin said at the Group of Seven summit in Denver last month that he expected Russia to join the World Trade Organisation this year.</p>
<p>But Yasin said Russia's economic "deformation" could cause problems. "It will be difficult for us in the next two or three years to meet all the demands of members of that organisation," he said.</p>
<p>However, unless it resolved the problems it would be difficult to operate on the world markets as the WTO was a powerful defence mechanism for its members.</p>
<p>Yasin said Russia's metallurgical industry had faced anti-dumping accusations in several countries.</p>
<p>"They are not always justified but it is difficult for us to defend ourselves."</p>
<p>However, Yasin said the Russian government's trade policy made it a suitable candidate for WTO membership.</p>
<p>"The Russian government is oriented to openness and exports so we must join the WTO," he said.</p>
