<p>Canada's Parliament opened its first debate on Tuesday on a bill that would make it a crime for parents to use corporal punishment against their children.</p>
<p>The bill, opposed by the government, would repeal Section 43 of the Criminal Code, which specifically exempts parents, teachers and guardians from being charged with assault if they use "reasonable" force in disciplining a child.</p>
<p>That provision protected a U.S. tourist charged with assault in Ontario in 1994 for spanking his daughter for slamming the door on her sister's fingers. The judge ruled he had behaved reasonably.</p>
<p>Liberal Sharon Carstairs kicked off debate in the unelected Senate on her bill, similar to one introduced by a leftist minority party in the elected House of Commons.</p>
<p>"Research has shown that corporal punishment of children is harmful in numerous ways," Carstairs said. "It leads to the injury and death of children, it contributes to the level of violence and aggression in society, it contributes to juvenile delinquency and it normalizes violence as a way of resolving conflict."</p>
<p>The Liberal Party government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien made it clear it favored the status quo.</p>
<p>Jennifer Lang, spokeswoman for Justice Minister Allan Rock, said the government's position remained as Rock had stated it in 1995 when he said, "The government has no intention to introduce any change to Section 43 of the Criminal Code."</p>
<p>Canadian legislators occasionally succeed in pushing through bills that are not supported by the government.</p>
<p>The opposition Reform Party in the House of Commons asserted that the public would be heavily opposed to a change.</p>
<p>"Every time the government indicates a desire to violate the rights of responsible children to raise their children, the public outcry is incredible," said Reform Member of Parliament Sharon Hayes, who speaks on family issues.</p>
<p>The conservative group Focus on the Family issued a statement that the bill would "lead to unncessary state interference in family life and ... undermine parents' efforts to direct their children's upbringing."</p>
<p>The Evangelical Fellowship of Canada's national affairs director, Bruce Clemenger, said his group was concerned about child abuse but stated: "We think the current law puts reasonable limit on the corporal discipline of children."</p>
<p>Another coalition, led by the Repeal 43 Committee, held a news conference to support Carstairs' efforts and said six western countries, mostly Scandinavian, ban spanking.</p>
<p>"At the present time, Section 43 is a hitting license," committee coordinator Corinne Robertshaw said.</p>
<p>Carstairs declared: "It is not my intention to criminalize parents for spanking their children."</p>
<p>But a Justice Department legal expert on the subject, Carole Morency, told Reuters charges could in theory be brought under the Criminal Code in any and every use of force by a parent against a child if Section 43 were repealed. She said the code did not authorize the abuse of children, adding that offenders are prosecuted under other provisions.</p>
