<p>A strong run so far for emerging markets in 1997 could slow this week as investors pause for breath, but analysts say a longer term uptrend remains intact.</p>
<p>They said holidays in some markets were likely to keep a lid on moves until later in the week, with a positive tone expected for emerging European markets and a consolidation possible in Latin America.</p>
<p>In RUSSIA, the Federation Council upper house of parliament is due to debate the 1997 budget, but this should be a formality.</p>
<p>The IMF decided on Friday to release $650 million of its $10 billion three-year loan to Russia, providing a vote of confidence for the country's painful economic reform programme.</p>
<p>The IMF delayed paying two tranches of the three-year loan in the last quarter of 1996 but decided to release the January tranche and one of the delayed payments.</p>
<p>The market will continue to watch for clues about the health of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and preparations for a planned mark Eurobond offering of about $1 billion in early March could attract some attention.</p>
<p>BULGARIA waits for its new caretaker cabinet, expected to be led by Sofia's respected mayor Stefan Sofianski.</p>
<p>It will take office once parliament has cleared outstanding business and a session is scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Socialists agreed to hold elections on April 20 and analysts said the decision had boosted sentiment but cautioned that further hiccups could be expected.</p>
<p>"There is a question how much co-operation a new government will get from the Socialists...The formation of the cabinet could provide a dose of realism by not co-operating with the UDF (opposition coalition)," said Jonathan Hoffman, director of economics at CSFB.</p>
<p>Hoffman said ROMANIA would attract attention in coming weeks with the new government expected to come up with some tough measures on economic reform.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Victor Ciobrea said recently a tough reform programme being drafted by his centrist government was Romania's last chance to avoid sliding into an economic crisis like neighbouring Bulgaria.</p>
<p>POLAND's newly appointed Finance Minister Marek Belka will be closely watched to see how firm he stands in the face of any political pressure, analysts said.</p>
<p>Belka has pledged policy continuity following his appointment on Tuesday when Grzegorz Kolodko quit after three years in the post.</p>
<p>In BRAZIL, a carnival holiday on Monday and Tuesday will cap activity, but after a strong month and generally positive news in recent weeks a mild correction could be in store.</p>
<p>"There has been a lot of good news from Brazil and we could see a bit of a correction...but we still like it," Alan Livsey, head of Latam research at Kleinwort Benson said.</p>
<p>He said ARGENTINA, like many Latin American markets, may need a short term rest after a recent strong run, with a protracted struggle over labour reforms under the spotlight.</p>
<p>Government, unions and business were due to meet on Friday over the reforms. The government and the CGT labour federation cut off all talks after a strike on December 26 to protest at attempts to reform labour law and reduce union power by presidential decree.</p>
<p>CHILE's move to cut interbank daily interest rates by 0.25 percentage points could draw some interest, if foreign investors latch onto it as a signal of monetary policy easing this year.</p>
<p>A big day for U.S. figures on Friday could also influence direction in emerging markets, analysts said, with PPI, industrial production and capacity utilisation figures due.</p>
<p>ECUADOR is set for a bumpy ride after the ousting by Congress of President Abdala Bucaram on Thursday. Vice-President Rosalia Arteaga was appointed interim president on Monday.</p>
<p>A positive speech at the opening of parliament by SOUTH AFRICAN president Nelson Mandela on Friday could aid a further rally in the rand, which has made strong ground so far in 1997 amid renewed portfolio interest.</p>
<p>Analysts said the speech contained little fresh news but should encourage buoyant investor sentiment.</p>
<p>The IFC emerging market composite investable index, IFC/IPRD, denominated in dollars, closed up 2.2 percent from a week previously at 322.29 points on Friday. In the year to date it has gained 9.2 percent.</p>
<p>Latin America was at 604.24, 3.0 percent up from a week previously, Asia was up 0.7 percent at 262.91 and Europe, Middle East and Africa was quoted at 156.07, up 4.1 percent.</p>
