<p>U.S. multi-national Owens Corning has sealed a deal for a 100 million rand majority shareholding in Acoustical Fibreglass Insulation (AFI), the South African firm said on Monday.</p>
<p>Ohio-based Owens Coring will take a 51 percent slice of privately-owned AFI and re-establish an interest in a firm that it originally sold to Federale Volksbeleggings in 1982.</p>
<p>AFI, which is Africa's largest insulation maker, will now be called Owens Corning South Africa (Pty) Ltd.</p>
<p>Owens Corning said South Africa offered excellent investment opportunities for overseas players.</p>
<p>"The stated intention of government to stimulate economic growth will be an important catalyst in attracting additional foreign investment," said Warren Knowlton, presdident of Owens Corning Building Materials Europe.</p>
<p>AFI makes fibreglass reinforcement for the plastics industry, mineral glasswool insulation and slagwool/rockwool insulation in plants in Gauteng and North West Province.</p>
<p>Owens Corning had 1995 sales of $3.6 billion and employs 18,000 people in more than 30 countries.</p>
<p>Earlier this month another U.S. group, drugs giant American Home Products, returned to South Africa when its Wyeth-Ayerst/Whitehall International unit bought six drugs it originally owned from South African Druggists.</p>
<p>AHP had left the South African market in 1989.</p>
