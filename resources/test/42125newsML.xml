<p>Following is a selection of reactions to UK August producer price data, which showed output prices unchanged m/m, up 2.0 percent y/y and input prices up 0.3 percent m/m and down 2.2 percent y/y.</p>
<p>The consensus forecast was for output prices to be flat on the month and rise 0.2 percent y/y, while input prices were seen rising 0.3 percent m/m and falling 2.2 percent y/y.</p>
<p>MARK HALE, SAKURA FINANCE</p>
<p>"Excellent figures, particularly impressive when you bear in mind several adverse factors, notably the rise in global oil prices."  </p>
<p>CHRIS TINKER, STANDARD CHARTERED (RFTV)</p>
<p>"The jump in the oil prices was factored into most people's expectations. From a global basis, input prices across Europe, the United States and Japan are all showing very very week rising price levels. With the exception of that oil price, we would obviously have seen even weaker input price numbers coming through. In general, in line with expectations in the markets. It shifts the focus to the retail price figures on Thursday, where perhaps we will be seeing a pickup in demand beginning to feed through to a slight lifting in retailers trying to put through higher prices."  </p>
<p>JEREMY HAWKINS, BANK OF AMERICA</p>
<p>"The UK PPIs are again soft and, while of limited direct relevance to Thursday's RPIs, should be seen as boosting the chances of the government meeting its 2.5 percent medium-term RPIX objective. Core output prices have virtually come to a standstill. In part this must say something about the still fragile state of the recovery in domestic demand, but it does also support the notion that costs have been genuinely brought under control...Unlikely to be enough to accommodate another cut in base rate, but at least should be seen as weak enough to keep speculation alive."  </p>
<p>MARIAN BELL, ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND</p>
<p>"As expected, August producer price data are market neutral. Though they confirm very modest producer price inflation...we do not expect the rest of the week's inflation news to be as encouraging. We forecast August RPIX on Thursday remaining at 2.8 percent year-on-year and a risk of a further pickup in underlying average earenings growth to four percent on Wednesday."</p>
