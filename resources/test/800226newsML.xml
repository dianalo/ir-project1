<p>Months-old cooperation talks between Brussels-based Belgian brokerage Mignon Hanart Declerck and Ghent-based Belgian brokerage Nedee &amp; Cie have broken off, spokespeople for both companies said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"In the spring, and up to July, we have investigated different forms of possible cooperation agreements. We have not found a consensus," Nedee management committee member Nadine De Weerdt told Reuters.</p>
<p>She added the failure of the talks was not a question of money alone.  </p>
<p>"We could not agree on the terms," Mignon partner Daniel Mignon told Reuters.</p>
<p>Both firms had been in talks since February. Mignon, 70 percent owned by Daniel Mignon, is one of the few independent brokerage houses on the Belgian market and employs 15 people. Nedee, which employs 90 people in Ghent and other Flemish cities, is 100 percent owned by Cera Bank.</p>
<p>A merger between the two would have consolidated Nedee's position as a top ten broker and given it a stronger presence on the Brussels market.</p>
<p>Following the failure of the talks, Georges Hanart, one of Mignon's key partners, has moved to Vermeulen Raemdonck, a brokerage 80 percent owned by Banque Bruxelles Lambert, one of the country's top four banks.</p>
<p>He will act as a consultant to Vermeulen Raemdonck and reinforce the brokerage's trading activities, Vermeulen Raemdonck executive Philippe Masset told Reuters.</p>
<p>At Mignon, Hanart was a specialist in the development of indices and trade with anglo-saxon investors.</p>
<p>Daniel Mignon said his firm would now focus more on fund management.</p>
