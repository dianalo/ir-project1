<p>The federal government conditionally approved the merger of Swiss drug giants Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG Tuesday in a deal to create the world's second largest drug company, Novartis.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission said it would require a record $1 billion-plus in divestitures and licensing to preserve competition in key areas. The heart of the agreement involves quick action to ensure a strong second player in the burgeoning new field of gene therapy.</p>
<p>Novartis will likely come into being to challenge world giant Glaxo-Wellcome of Britain within three months, pending final action by the FTC soon after a 60-day comment period.</p>
<p>"After only nine months of intensive preparations, we can now move forward with the task of building the world's leading life sciences company," Novartis Chairman Alex Krauer, the former Ciba-Geigy boss, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The combined capitalization of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz would be more than $75 billion, said Sandoz Chief Financial Officer Raymund Breu at a news conference in Switzerland, noting that capitalization had jumped a third since the deal was first announced.</p>
<p>Breu, designated chief financial officer of Novartis, said the partners would post a combined profit of around $3 billion in 1996, while merger costs this year would total $1.5 billion once after-tax charges of $2.6 billion were offset by divestment profits of $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Combined sales were $20 billion in the core pharmaceutical, agricultural and nutrition businesses based on 1995 figures.</p>
<p>Novartis would have a leading position in generic drugs, a broad range of healthcare products and clear dominance in crop protection products, analysts said.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, Sandoz has agreed that to sell its corn herbicide business in the United States and Canada and its U.S. pet flea and tick control business.</p>
<p>The corn herbicide business is the largest piece to be sold, going for $780 million (corrects from billion) to BASF in a deal that was announced in September to expedite the FTC's review.</p>
<p>Sandoz's flea control business would be sold to Central Garden &amp; Pet Co. of Lafayette, Calif., or another FTC-approved buyer, but that deal is not complete. The new producer of pet products would be permitted to produce its own methoprene, the active ingredient in the flea products.</p>
<p>But the area with the biggest growth potential and long-lasting repercussions is gene therapy, an FTC official said.</p>
<p>Techniques to modifying the genes in patients' cells are now in clincial trials but have not yet gone to market. Gene therapy has the potential to treat various hereditary ailments, cancer and the rejection of organ transplants.</p>
<p>The U.S. government estimates gene therapy will be a $500 million market by 2002, mushrooming to $45 billion by 2010.</p>
<p>Sandoz agreed to license some gene therapy technology and patent rights to Rhone-Poulenc Rorer so that it can compete against the new combined firm.</p>
<p>William Baer, director of the Bureau of Competition for the Federal Trade Commission, said Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy were further along than other firms in developing gene therapy.</p>
<p>"If you combine the considerable intellectual property rights these two firms have together they are going to have a virtual monopoly over research and development and eventually marketing of these new therapies," Baer said in an interview.</p>
<p>He said the agreement insures "there will be a second firm, just as there is today, with the bundle of intellectual property rights needed to develop these products."</p>
<p>The price for licensing the gene therapy will be hammered out over the next few months and will go to arbitration if necessary, Baer said.</p>
<p>The merger, which was approved by the stockholders of each company in April and by the European Comission in July, will be a tax-free combination under Swiss law.</p>
<p>Sandoz shareholders will receive 55 percent of the new company's shares and Ciba shareholders 45 percent. Ciba shareholders receive 1-1/15 Novartis shares for each Ciba share, while Sandoz shareholders will get a one-for-one trade, the companies have said.</p>
