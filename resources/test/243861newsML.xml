<p>The European Commission will recognise formally, perhaps as early as January, the existence of a market for selling airport slots, which analysts estimate at up to 10 millions of pounds ($16.5 million) in Europe's congested airports.</p>
<p>"We may have a decision in January. Work is well advanced," an EU official said. He said the main changes to the current EU legislation aimed at making it easier for new carriers to enter the market and ensuring transparency in the slot allocation decision-process.</p>
<p>Landing and taking-off rights are particularly valuable assets especially at airports such as London Heathrow, Paris Orly, Frankfurt and Milan.</p>
<p>Despite that, a three-year-old EU regulation does not allow the trade in slots, requesting instead that they be swapped or made available to newcomers if unused.</p>
<p>However, it is common practice that slots change hands regularly in Europe for millions of pounds (dollars), airline analysts and EU sources said.</p>
<p>So rather than turning a blind eye to the practice, the Commission wants to introduce some order in the market to promote fair competition.</p>
<p>"Why should we ban it? In the name of what?" the EU source said.</p>
<p>"We want to revise the existing rules to give newcomers a better chance, to have more transparent slot coordinating bodies so that they are not influenced by incumbent carriers or airports authorities," he added.</p>
<p>One possibility was to impose limits on the number of slots one airline could have, he said.</p>
<p>The Commission's more open approach towards airport slots trading did not change its opinion regarding the alliance between British Airways and American Airlines, the sources said.</p>
<p>Other EU officials reacted angrily earlier on Monday to reports that BA may sell 168 slots at Heathrow to win approval for its trans-Atlantic link-up from the British authorities. ($ = 0.607 British Pounds)</p>
