<p>Many  Polish priests tried to explain to their congregations on Sunday why a prominent pro-abortion gynaecologist had been denied a Catholic burial last week in the central city of Lodz.</p>
<p>"People, come to your senses," exhorted the homilist at St Andrew's Church near Reuters Warsaw bureau. "Even Catholics have become muddled by all the media publicity."</p>
<p>"Professor (Waclaw) Dec was a declared non-believer who never darkened a church doorway, and he publicly advocated the killing of unborn infants. Allowing a Catholic funeral would have meant sowing demoralisation."</p>
<p>According to Catholic Canon Law, a funeral mass may be denied to heretics, apostates, schismatics, those who order cremation as a sign of religious defiance and others who have not not retracted public violations of Church teachings.</p>
<p>With the exception of a statement in defence of the denial by Episcopate spokesman Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek, the media have largely publicised views critical of the move.</p>
<p>"I am a practising Catholic but from today on I won't throw a penny into the collection basket," an irate woman told the daily Super Express in front of the locked church.</p>
<p>"Ten years ago the professor saved my life and thanks to him I now have a seven-year-old son," another woman said.</p>
<p>"To my mind he was a better Christian than the bishop," a middle-aged man told public television.</p>
<p>He was one of some 1,000 people who had come to pay their respects after seeing Dec's obituarary in the press.</p>
<p>The requiem mass was denied on orders from the Archbishop of Lodz, Wladyslaw Ziolek.</p>
<p>Dec, who had headed the local Institute of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, had been a champion of abortion rights and several years ago had been voted Lodz's "Man of the Year".</p>
<p>At the last moment, Dec's family arranged for a graveside service conducted by a military chaplain not under the archbishop's jurisdiction.</p>
