<p>Prices rose on Istanbul's gold exchange on Monday while volume dived on thin free market demand despite an expected rise at the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>Gold closed at $380.80 an ounce, up from $380.50 on Friday. There were no dollar term deals in the afternoon session.</p>
<p>Gold jumped to 1,169,500 lira per gram from Friday's 1,165,200 close partly reflecting a weak lira in the domestic currency market.</p>
<p>The lira ended down at 95,320 against the dollar after 94,900 on Friday due to the central bank's higher key dollar rate for banks' compulsory currency transfers.</p>
<p>Traded volume shrank to 531 kilos from Friday's 966.</p>
<p>"Although fresh demand was awaited at the beginning of the week following gold jewellery sales at the weekend, bullion demand from the free market was very weak, probably because it is off season," a dealer said.</p>
