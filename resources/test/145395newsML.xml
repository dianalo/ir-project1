<p>Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd  7267 T plan to boost their domestic output in the October-December period, a business daily said on Friday.</p>
<p>Nihon Keizai Shimbun said Toyota plans to increase its domestic production in the period by 17 percent year-on-year to 910,000 cars and Honda plans a boost of 32 percent to 300,000 units.</p>
<p>Toyota and Honda spokesmen were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The planned production increase is because sales of new models are robust and falls in the firms' exports are slowing, the paper said.</p>
<p>The carmakers also expect demand for cars to grow further ahead of a rise in Japan's consumption tax next April, it said.</p>
<p>Other Japanese carmakers' domestic production in October-December will stay unchanged from a year ago or will grow only slightly, the paper said.</p>
