<p>South Africa's Samancor Ltd said on Thursday that it had sold its 50 percent stake in EMSA Ltd to its joint-venture partner United States firm UCAR International Corp for $75 million in cash.  </p>
<p>EMSA makes graphite electrodes and speciality products and has a capacity of 30,000 tons a year. It is managed by UCAR and Samancor said it did not consider the stake a core asset.</p>
<p>UCAR is the largest maker of graphite and carbon electrodes in the world.</p>
<p>"The sale will not have a material impact on Samancor's earnings, but will boost its cash reserves," the firm said.</p>
<p>The deal is subject to the signing of final agreements and necessary regulatory approvals.</p>
