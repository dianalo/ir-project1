<p>Singapore hanged three people on Friday for drug smuggling and armed robbery, officials said.</p>
<p>Two Singaporeans were executed for drug smuggling. The Prisons Department had initially said the third was hanged for murder, but a police spokesman later said it was for armed robbery.</p>
<p>"He used a firearm in the commission of a crime, which in this case, was armed robbery," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Under the law, discharge of a gun during the commission a crime is punishable by death.</p>
<p>No further details were available on the executions.</p>
<p>Singapore normally carries out executions by hanging on Fridays.</p>
<p>It has tough anti-drug laws, with mandatory death sentences for anyone over 18 found guilty of trafficking in more than 15 grams (half an ounce) of heroin, 30 grams (an ounce) of morphine or 500 grams (18 oz) of cannabis.</p>
<p>Nearly 300 people have been hanged in Singapore since 1975, more than half of them for drug-related offences.</p>
