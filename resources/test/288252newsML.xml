<p>Placer Dome Inc said Monday it was studying with interest a proposal from takeover target Highlands Gold Ltd of Australia and planned to issue a response later.</p>
<p>"We're interested in their proposal and we're studying it," said Placer spokesman Hugh Leggatt.</p>
<p>He said the Vancouver gold miner expected to give its response during Australian business hours.</p>
<p>Highlands earlier offered to sell its 25 percent stake in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea to Placer and spin off the rest of its assets into a new company.  </p>
<p>Highlands said the restructuring would give shareholders substantially greater value than Placer's A$0.75 a share bid. Its board continued to urge shareholders to reject that bid.</p>
<p>Last month Placer offered to buy Highlands' stake in Porgera for A$276.8 million. Placer already holds a separate 25 percent stake in Porgera through its Placer Pacific Ltd unit.</p>
<p>Placer holds 40.8 percent of Highlands.</p>
