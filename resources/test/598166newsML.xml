<headline>NYMEX Hub natgas ends lower after late selloff.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-20</dateline>

<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures pared afternoon gains and ended lower Tuesday in an active session, hit by a wave of long liquidation and profit taking just before the close, industry sources said.</p>
<p>June slipped 2.4 cents to close at $2.191 per million British thermal units. July settled 1.6 cents lower at $2.23. Other deferreds ended down by 0.1 to 6.5 cents.</p>
<p>"When they couldn't sell it down early, locals got long, then dumped it late," said one East Coast trader, adding there was still a lot of length in the market likely to exit this week before the U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend.  </p>
<p>But opinions remained mixed about market direction. While some saw the market fairly well-supported by steady injection demand and some western cooling load, others expected fairly mild weather over the rest of the nation and long liquidation ahead of June's May 28 expiry to drag the complex lower.</p>
<p>The 6-10 day weather outlook calls for normal to below-normal temperatures for the eastern two-thirds of the nation, with the West and southern Texas expected above-normal.</p>
<p>Early injection estimates for Wednesday's weekly AGA storage report still range from 50 to 75 bcf.</p>
<p>Technical traders agreed the market was range-bound, with June support and resistance still at $2.15 and $2.30, respectively. Major buying was seen at the $2.05 double bottom, with key selling expected at the $2.43 contract high.</p>
<p>Maintenance on Transco's Texas line will continue to cut about 400 mmcfd out of a total capacity of about 600 mmcfd Tuesday through Thursday.</p>
<p>Planned work on Mobil's Mary Ann gas processing plant in Coden, Alabama, has cut the plant's total processing capacity of 380-390 mmcfd. About 120 mmcfd should be back within the next seven days, with the balance due back in three weeks.</p>
<p>In the cash, Gulf Coast swing prices slipped a few cents Tuesday to the high-teens. Midcon pipes were down slightly to about $2.00. New York city gate gas was quoted about five cents lower in the mid-$2.40s.</p>
<p>The NYMEX Henry Hub 12-month strip fell 0.9 cents to $2.251. NYMEX trading volume was unavailable.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, June finished two cents lower at $2.045, while deferreds ended down by 1.5 to three cents. The East/West spread narrowed by one-half cent to 14.5 cents (NYMEX premium).</p>
