<p>The National Bank of Hungary (NBH) is likely to propose lifting restrictions on long-term capital movements from 1998 but the freeing of short-term movements is not to be expected yet, the NBH said on Monday.</p>
<p>"The analysts agree (with the NBH) that a liberalisation of short-term movements would depend on the macroeconomic situation and its sustainability," Judit Vadasz, head of the NBH regulatory department told Reuters. "We are still cautious."</p>
<p>The NBH's board recently concluded its proposals on continuing to ease foreign currency rules, and talks with the Finance Ministry on the issue are underway.</p>
<p>The government may discuss the proposals at the end of August or in early September, following consultations between the ministries, Vadasz said.</p>
<p>Hungary's forint became convertible in current account terms on January 1996.</p>
<p>When it joined the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) last March, Hungary also undertook to allow foreign companies to open branches in the country from 1998.</p>
<p>The NBH is proposing that in addition to the above measure, other amendments on the currency law and the linked government decree should also be passed by January 1, Vadasz said.</p>
<p>As a result of the new legislation, Hungarians would be allowed to buy shares in all companies registered in OECD countries, as well as notes of OECD-based investment funds.</p>
<p>Currently, Hungarians can buy only stocks of OECD-based firms holding at least investment grade and are not permitted to purchase foreign investment notes.</p>
<p>The NBH would also like to open the way for Hungarians to purchase real estate abroad, Vadasz said.</p>
<p>Vadasz said recent press reports that the NBH may also propose allowing foreigners to enter Hungary's currency futures markets were premature.</p>
<p>"We don't propose that now," Vadasz said. "And generally speaking, we don't want to liberalise short-term capital yet."</p>
<p>Currently, foreigners are not allowed to buy Hungarian government securities with a shorter maturity than one year.</p>
<p>Vadasz said Hungary's economic situation improved much in the past two years, justifying current account and capital movements liberalisation measures taken in that period.</p>
<p>Hungary expects to boost gross domestic product (GDP) growth to three percent this year and to about four percent next year from one percent in 1996, while keeping the government budget and current account deficits stable.</p>
<p>Before further large-scale currency liberalisation, the NBH would like to monitor how the economy initially responds to the upswing, Vadasz said.</p>
<p>"The question is how firm the confidence in forint is abroad," she said.</p>
<p>Vadasz said that the current account, domestic interest rates, the forint exchange rate would be among the factors influencing the NBH when considering further liberalisation, adding that next year's elections may also mix a shade of uncertainty into the overall picture in the eyes of investors.</p>
<p>The forint has traded close to the upper level of the NBH's 4.5 percent wide intervention level since early 1996, drifting marginally away from the resistance level occassionally but returning to it within a few weeks.</p>
