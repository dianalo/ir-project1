<text>
<p>The Internal Market Council will authorise the European Commission on Friday to open talks with Norway on an accord on customs cooperation.</p>
<p>The accord would be a response to the situation created when Norway's voters decided their country should not enter the European Union.</p>
<p>It soon became clear that agreements between Sweden and Norway and between Finland and Norway, under which Norwegian officials carry out customs tasks in remote border areas on behalf of the two countries, were not compatible with Community law.</p>
<p>Under the agreement to be negotiated, Norwegian officials would be able to carry out the customs duties, not only on behalf of Sweden and Finland, but on behalf of the EU as a whole.</p>
