<p>China's Chongqing Chang'an Automobile Co Ltd said on Monday that expanded company sales and rising revenues from its joint venture with two Japanese carmakers buoyed first-half net profits.</p>
<p>The company, a leading maker of mini-cars based in the southwestern city of Chongqing, posted net profits of 125.91 million yuan ($15.2 million) for the first half, up 41 percent from the year-ago period based on international accounting standards.</p>
<p>"The company's sales increased rapidly in the first half and pushed up net profits," a company spokesman told the Hong Kong-based newsletter China Securities Bulletin.</p>
<p>Sales rose by 29.8 percent year-on-year to 1,434.61 million yuan in the first half, he said.</p>
<p>The company sold 42,618 vehicles, including 1,800 sedan cars, and 13,233 engines in the first six months, he said.</p>
<p>Chongqing Suzuki Automobile Co Ltd, a joint venture between Chang'an and two Japanese firms, sold 12,810 mini-cars in the first half, surging 90 percent year-on-year, he said.</p>
<p>Suzuki Motor Corp owns 35 percent of the venture with the remaining 15 percent held by Nisso Iwai Corp.</p>
<p>The venture, in which Chongqing Chang'an holds a 50 percent stake, reversed losses of 34 million yuan in the first half of 1996 to make a net profit of 30 million yuan in the first half of this year, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Sales had risen sharply in major cities since the start of the year due to rising individual purchasing power, he said.</p>
<p>"The strong performance of the joint venture contributed revenue to our company," he said.</p>
<p>Chang'an would boost sales by upgrading after-sale services rather than by cutting prices in the second half, he said.</p>
<p>The company had 876.19 million outstanding shares at the end of June, including 120 million domestic A shares offered to the public in May and 250 million hard currency B shares.</p>
<p>Its per share net reached 0.144 yuan in the first half with net assets per share at 2.68 yuan. ($ = 8.289 Chinese Yuan)</p>
