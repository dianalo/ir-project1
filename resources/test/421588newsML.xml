<p>THE PROTEUS COLUMN</p>
<p>Brazil seems to be the place to be in 1997. The last two months have seen no fewer than 15 major developments in the insurance sector previously noted for its tranquillity.</p>
<p>The flurry of activity in the last month alone reflects the pace of change.</p>
<p>Generali do Brasil Sa, controlled by Italy's giant insurer Generali, formed a joint venture to market life insurance and pensions with the Banco Sudameris in Brazil.</p>
<p>Germany's Euro-Hannover Holding N.V., a unit of HDI group, fully acquired Brazilian insurance firm Hannover Paulista Seguros by buying the remaining 50 percent voting stake in the local insurer. It plans to invest five million marks to develop new insurance products for companies and individuals</p>
<p>Aetna joined the Brazilian life and health insurance market through a joint venture with Sul America Seguros, a Rio de Janeiro-based insurer. Aetna will invest $300m in the venture, and may invest an additional $90m depending on future performance.</p>
<p>Icatu Hartford Seguros, a joint-venture between Brazilian banking group Icatu and U.S. insurer ITT Hartford Group, said it planned to launch mass market insurance products to target groups in Brazil, and revealed it was negotiating to launch its first offers with a Brazilian supermarket chain and a local newspaper.</p>
<p>Internationale Nederlanden Groep NV, American International Group Inc affiliate American Life Insurance Co and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co have requested authorization to operate in Brazil's life insurance market, according to Brazil's insurance watchdog Susep.</p>
<p>In addition other insurers such as AGF, Liberty Mutual, and Chubb are active there, and Reliance National are investigating potential in the market.</p>
<p>Why all this interest?</p>
<p>Firstly, Brazil's insurance market is expected to grow at around 15 percent annually over the next few years due to increasing demand for life, pension and health plans triggered by reform of the social security system.</p>
<p>Second, continued political and monetary stability, which is encouraging people to think about savings particularly as the country modernises and familiarity with insurance concepts grow.</p>
<p>Third, encouragement from South America's Mercosur trading block, keen to show how the economies of its member nations have become much more product-innovative following the relaxation of tight state control.</p>
<p>Finally, there is encouragement by reinsurers, who see the region as a source of future reinsurance business.</p>
<p>This last point is important. With the privatisation of the state reinsurer IRB, reinsurance will become more competitive, fuelling a competitive surge. Commercial companies will feel increased pressure to improve employee benefits such as healthcare, disability, life and pension plans, and insurers are ready to respond.</p>
<p>With many holding the view that Brazil will join the 'first world' economies within the next ten years, investment and activity by global insurers will continue to increase.</p>
