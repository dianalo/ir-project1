<p>There is a 15 percent chance Australia will be hit by a giant tsunami, or harbour wave, in a 100-year period, scientists were told on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"This is something that the infrastructure builders should be considering," Ted Bryant of Australia's Woolongong University said at a conference on global weather.</p>
<p>In the last 1,000 years, Australia's coastline has been hit by a number of tsunamis, some followed by waves more than 80 metres high, Bryant said.</p>
<p>One tsunami that hit eastern Australia about 300 years ago may have been caused by an asteroid, Bryant said.</p>
