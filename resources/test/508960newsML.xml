<p>Hungary's inflation is likely to drop steadily in the next two years and a substantial increase in interest rates would not be justified, the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We expect inflation to drop slowly and gradually... in the next two years," deputy secretary of state Csaba Laszlo told a news conference.</p>
<p>The Central Statistical Office said last week that the consumer price index (CPI) showed an 18.8 percent year-on-year rise in March, the same rate as in February.</p>
<p>The March figure broke a 14-month trend of decline, but was better than expected and the Finance Ministry maintains its forecast of 18 percent average inflation for 1997, Laszlo said.</p>
<p>"A substantial rise in inflation during the year cannot be expected," he added.</p>
<p>Analysts earlier said that the CPI may climb up during the period between June and September due to an unusually low basis of seasonal goods prices in 1996.</p>
<p>Laszlo said government securities yields went through an upward correction in the past three weeks, following the National Bank of Hungary's 0.25 percent increase in its six-month deposit interest rates to 21.00 percent.</p>
<p>"But there is no special reason for a further substantial rise in interest rates," he said. "From the inflation side, it's not justified that yields should begin to go upward."</p>
