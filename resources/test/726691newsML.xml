<p>The Bangladesh taka gave up early gains amid tight selling of dollars by state-owned banks, dealers said. Taka closed at Sunday's level of 43.7650/7700.</p>
<p>The local currency opened at 43.7500/7550 per dollar but started losing ground after a major state-owned bank stopped selling even before midday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Deals were mostly done at 43.7550/7600 per dollar and only a few late deals of smaller volumes were completed at 43.7700. The interbank call money rates closed unchanged at seven to eight percent.</p>
