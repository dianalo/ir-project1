<p>Economy Secretary Cristobal Montoro said on Sunday that Spain already fulfilled three of the five economic prerequisities to join the launch of Europe's common currency in 1999.</p>
<p>"Spain already fulfils three convergence criteria," Montoro told journalists at a news conference held before the Monday start of the Inter-American Development Bank annual meeting.</p>
<p>Spain has adhered to long-term interest rate requirements for several months, he said. In early March, it also began tentatively to fulfil criteria on inflation and exchange rate stability.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, inflation may not exceed the average of the three best EU performers by more than 1.5 points on average in 1997. In February data released last week, Spain's year-on-year rate slid to 2.5 percent from 2.9 percent in January.</p>
<p>Exchange rates must hold stable within restricted bands for more than two years. Spain's last peseta devaluation was on March 8, 1995.</p>
<p>Montoro also said that the launch of the common currency must be composed of as many nations as possible, given that they have adhered to the economic rules.</p>
<p>"It is very important that it be done in a broad-based fashion. The more countries the better," Montoro said.</p>
<p>He said debate about excluding countries was counterproductive.</p>
<p>"We are hurting everyone with these types of thoughts about an exclusive Europe," Montoro said.</p>
