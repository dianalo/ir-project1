<p>Indonesian palm olein prices were lower in late Tuesday trading in line with Malaysian values as buyers stayed cautious expecting further falls, traders said.</p>
<p>They said palm olein was around 1,440-50 rupiah/kg in Jakarta, compared with the morning's 1,455-60 rupiah. Some quotes were heard at 1,435 rupiah.</p>
<p>Traders said market talk that 5,000 tonnes of imported olein was headed for Surabaya pushed buyers to the sidelines.</p>
<p>The cargo was said to be the last of a 20,000-tonne consignment ordered by state logistics agency BULOG from Malaysia to cool local prices.  </p>
<p>"The 5,000-tonne shipment would complete BULOG's 20,000-tonne order from Malaysia," one trader said. "There has been no news on whether BULOG has made fresh orders."</p>
<p>Traders said supply of prompt-delivery olein was expected to pick up through the week with the arrival of several shipments, including one with 6,000 tonnes from Belawan Port.</p>
<p>"I think prices are likely to be depressed in the near term because of BULOG," one trader said, adding that sharp falls in Malaysia on Tuesday also impacted the local market.</p>
