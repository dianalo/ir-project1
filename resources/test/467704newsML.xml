<p>Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told reporters on Tuesday that his ministry would deal sternly with Nomura Securities Co Ltd if investigations confirm it violated securities laws.</p>
<p>"The Finance Ministry will take stern measures against Nomura after the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) reports to the ministry about the results of its probe," he said.</p>
<p>He also said it was "extremely regrettable" if Nomura had again violated securities laws.  </p>
<p>His remarks followed a raid on Nomura's main offices and 10 other unspecified locations by prosecutors and officials from the nation's securities watchdog.</p>
<p>The SESC has been probing Nomura over its March 6 admission that two of its directors made discretionary deals banned under Japanese law and funnelled profits to a corporate client.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka said he believes the prosecutors and the SESC will conduct a prudent investigation into the incident.</p>
