<p>Eastern Province finally hit the winning trail with a hard fought 16-13 (halftime 13-8) win over Border in their Eastern Cape derby in the Currie Cup at Boet Erasmus on Saturday.</p>
<p>In an entertaining match E.P. deserved their second win of the season although Border ensured that each side scored two tries with a consolation effort by hooker Ruhan van Zyl in the last minute of the match.</p>
<p>All the other tries were scored in the first half with flyhalf Bertus Kruger and number eight Andre Vos crossing for E.P. after fine breaks by Ronnie Fourie and new cap Deon Kayser.</p>
<p>But Border, who showed a willingness to run the ball at any opportunity, had the satisfaction of scoring the try of the match.</p>
<p>Running from his own tryline left wing Alistair Alexander ran half the length of the field before flanker Bennie Jacobs took the final pass to cross in the right and corner.</p>
<p>Scorers:</p>
<p>Eastern Province - Tries: Bertus Kruger, Andre Vos. Penalties: Kruger (2).</p>
<p>Border - Tries: Bennie Jacobs, Ruhan van Zyl. Penalty: Greg Miller.</p>
