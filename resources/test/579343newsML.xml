<headline>Montgomery Ward's first-quarter loss swells.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-13</dateline>

<p>Montgomery Ward Holding Corp. said Tuesday its losses grew almost three-fold in first quarter as a flood of merchandise markdowns pressured results, and the company was looking for ways to solve its liquidity problems.</p>
<p>Montgomery Ward said it lost $144 million in the first quarter vs. a loss of $51 million last year. Total revenues fell to $1.33 billion from $1.44 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>The retailer earmarked $300 million in merchandise for liquidation during the fourth quarter of 1996 in an effort to make room for new goods that it hopes will sell more quickly. It said $87 million of the old merchandise still remained to be cleared out as of March 29.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company said it had lost market share to competitors. Apparel sales fell 5 percent during the quarter, electronics sales declined 24 percent and appliance sales dropped 4 percent during the quarter, Montgomery Ward said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The privately held company is holding talks with lenders to find a solution to its liquidity problems and to refinance its debt, including $1.44 billion that will mature on August 29, it said.</p>
<p>Montgomery Ward said it and its largest shareholder, General Electric Co.'s GE Capital Corp., believe the company will arrange new financing. Montgomery Ward has slowed its expansion, is considering closing unprofitable stores and is looking for a buyer of its Signature Group, a direct marketing company, according to the SEC filing.</p>
