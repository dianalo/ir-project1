<headline>UAL sees '97 earnings above analyst view.</headline>

<p>UAL Corp, parent of United Airlines, said Tuesday 1997 earnings on a fully distributed basis should modestly exceed the current analyst consensus estimate of $9.26 a share as reported by First Call.</p>
<p>Earlier, UAL reported second quarter earnings of $2.82 a share on a fully distributed basis, up from $2.52 a share excluding $0.34 in charges.  </p>
<p>"We are pleased with United's strong second quarter performance," Gerald Greenwald, chairman, said in a statement. "This year's second quarter fully distributed earnings and earnings per share surpassed the record levels set in 1996."</p>
<p>He added that the reinstatement of the 10 percent ticket tax made it difficult to produce year-over-year improvements in unit revenue and fully distributed earnings per share.</p>
<p>"While adhering to our long-term strategy of increasing unit revenue through improved customer satisfaction, we continued to implement our cost-reduction program," Greenwald said.</p>
<p>He added that United's fully distributed unit cost rose by only 0.3 percent.</p>
<p>Operating revenues for the quarter rose 5.2 percent to $4.4 billion. U.S. domestic passenger unit revenue growth was hurt by the reimposition of the federal ticket tax, UAL said. This was offset by the strength of Atlantic and Latin America markets, it added.</p>
<p>Second quarter passenger revenues rose 4.3 percent to $3.85 billion from $3.69 billion. Cargo revenues gained 12 percent to $215 million from $192 million.</p>
