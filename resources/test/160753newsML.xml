<p>A key gauge of economic activity posted an eighth straight monthly increase in September, the Conference Board said Friday, though it was the smallest gain in the string of monthly rises.</p>
<p>The Index of Leading Indicators, which is supposed to forecast economic trends six to nine months ahead, was barely up by 0.1 percent after a 0.2 percent increase in August.</p>
<p>In early trading bond prices surged, but analysts said the report on September economic indicators was overshadowed by the Labour Department's report that the nation's unemployment rate was unchanged in October.</p>
<p>The slight rise in the index during September was consistent with other recent reports portraying an economy still expanding after more than 5-1/2 years of unbroken growth though at a slower pace than at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>The leading index measures a basket of economic indicators, from unemployment benefit claims to building permits. Six of its 11 components strengthened in September, while five were weaker than in August.</p>
<p>The biggest contributors to the leading index in September were stronger orders for new plant and equipment, as well as higher commodity and stock prices. In addition, consumer expectations were brighter than in August, orders for consumer goods were up and the average workweek was longer.</p>
<p>The signals of declining activity in September came from increased new applications for unemployment pay, faster vendor deliveries and smaller order backlogs for long-lasting durable goods. Also, there were fewer new applications for building permits and a lower money supply.</p>
<p>Recent reports have indicated the economy has been losing steam after an exceptionally brisk first half this year.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross domestic product, or GDP, slowed abruptly in the third quarter to a 2.2 percent rate of expansion from 4.7 percent in the second quarter.</p>
<p>The last time the leading index turned down was last January. It began rising in February and has continued to do so in every month since then, steadily signalling growth ahead even if by the slimmest possible margin, as in September.</p>
