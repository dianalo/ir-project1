<p>French first division leaders Monaco needed a penalty shootout to dispose of dogged second division Troyes after their League Cup second round match ended in a 3-3 draw after extra time on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Troyes missed two penalties as Monaco, who meet Newcastle United in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals in March, took the shootout 4-2.</p>
<p>Di Rocco hit a hat-trick for Troyes in normal time while Swiss Marco Grassi, twice, and Nigeria's Victor Ikpeba replied for Monaco. There were no goals in extra-time.</p>
<p>Third division Nimes, the French Cup finalists who reached the second round of this season's European Cup Winners' Cup, carried their giant-killing into the League Cup with a 1-0 home win over first division Guingamp.</p>
<p>Paris Saint-Germain and Auxerre, favourites with Monaco for the league championship, were eliminated by Lyon and Marseille respectively on Tuesday.</p>
