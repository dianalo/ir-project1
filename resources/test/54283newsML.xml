<p>The shift in China's textile production from coastal areas inland has begun with the opening of a textile factory in the western region of Xinjiang run by a Shanghai cotton mill, the China Daily Business Weekly said.</p>
<p>The Xinshen Textile Co Ltd, 51 percent owned by the Shanghai No.1 Cotton Mill, went into production recently in the Xinjiang city of Shihezi with the Shanghai firm responsible for production, the newspaper said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Shanghai has agreed to shift 200,000 spindles to textile plants in Xinjiang, close to cotton producing areas, both to lower labour costs and the costs of raw materials.</p>
<p>Most of the Shanghai textile factories involved will be closed. Many are equipped with old, inefficient equipment and are major sources of pollution.</p>
