<p>Bulgaria's attempt to close lossmaking state enterprises has been slowed down by legal tangles, an official said on Friday.</p>
<p>"Enterprises, which have operated for many years, with various levels of success, can not be closed overnight," Pencho Hristov, head of restructuring department of the Industry Ministry told Reuters.</p>
<p>The government had pledged to make the closures in return for an International Monetary Fund (IMF) funding programme.</p>
<p>Of the 38 enterprises earmarked for closure by the industry ministry, 17 have been restructureed, 12 have closed and five sold to local investors.</p>
<p>The IMF is expected to evaluate Bulgaria's fulfilment of reform targets and decide shortly on a crucial second $115 million tranch of funding for the crumbling economy.</p>
<p>Under a reform agreement sealed with the IMF in July, Sofia stands to receive $580 billion over 20 months on completion of specific reform stages.</p>
<p>The second tranche was delayed by the Fund until the government closed or privatised a total of 64 lossmakers by the end of September.</p>
<p>"We try to choose the best solution for each enterprise as some of these current lossmakers have a very valuable and sophisticated equipment and could make profits if their debts were written off or paid by an interested investor," said Hristov.</p>
<p>The ministry seeks alternative solutions to closures in a bid to save productions, considred viable and have suffered losses because of a the country's slow transition to a market economy, he added.</p>
<p>"Our aim is to let viable firms, which suffer temporary problems continue operating under a more healthy management," he added.</p>
<p>Several of seven military equipment plants listed for closure will be merged with bigger plants and the ministry will freeze the remaining few of the seven military plants. Hristov declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>For a further 18 state firms privatisation procedures were opened. "But privatisation and merging are procedures take a longer time," he said.</p>
<p>Of 11,000 employed in the 38 lossmakers, some 4,200 employees have been shed so far, said Hristov.</p>
<p>The ministry plans to close down an additional 40 industrial lossmakers until the year-end, said Hristov.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the IMF will accept Bulgaria's justifications for the delayed completion of its reform targets.</p>
<p>Sofia is grappling with bank insolvency and the collapse of the lev, which plunged from 70 to the dollar in January to about 230 this week. It has effectively closed nine banks by putting them under state supervision and hiked the central bank interest rate to an all-time high of 300 percent.</p>
