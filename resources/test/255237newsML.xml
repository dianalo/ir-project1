<p>The U.S. Forest Service was expected to announce it will suspend further timber sales under the controversial salvage logging rider that expires at the year's end, wilderness advocates, timber industry spokesmen and congressional source said Friday.</p>
<p>They said it was unclear how much timber would be affected, but industry sources and wildlife advocates said they understood it could be 200-300 million board feet.  </p>
<p>A comment was not immediately available from the Forest Service, which is an Agriculture Department agency.</p>
<p>The Wilderness Society issued a news release in anticipation of a Forest Service announcement, applauding the suspension but saying it should have come sooner.</p>
<p>"By suspending timber sales until January 1, 1997, the Administration put an end to one of the worst environmental policies ever passed by Congress," Wilderness Society president Bill Meadows said in a statement.</p>
<p>"It's unfortunate the government waited until the eleventh hour to act," Meadows said.  </p>
<p>A spokesman for the American Forest and Paper Association said the timber industry group would withhold comment until after an announcement.</p>
<p>"We are hearing they will cancell X volume of timber sales," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Initially he said estimates were it could affect up to 300 million board feet of timber, then said he understood it would be closer to 100 million board feet.</p>
<p>Democratic and Republican congressional sources also said they expected an announcement.</p>
<p>The measure pushed by the timber industry was signed into law July 1995 and was to expire December 31. There has been a rush to enter into sales before that deadline for the timber that could be removed later.</p>
<p>Environmentalists claimed the measure to expedite logging of dead and dying trees was written so broadly that it gave timber companies ready access to healthy trees in national forests with minimal review of the environmental effects.</p>
<p>But loggers said the measure was essential to remove a heavy build-up of dead and dying trees in national forests that they said contributed to fires and impaired forest health.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration in a report released last week said areas of national forests with "virtually all live trees" were logged under the rider because of spotty enforcement of environmental rules.</p>
<p>But it most salvage sales complied with safeguards Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman required.</p>
<p>President Clinton has said he regretted signing the measure which was part of a budget bill.</p>
