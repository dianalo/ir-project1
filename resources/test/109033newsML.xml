<p>Police investigating a double IRA bombing of Britain's army headquarters in Northern Ireland said they arrested one man in a dawn raid on Thursday.</p>
<p>The arrest came less than 24 hours after police issued a photofit picture of one of the bombers, disguised in a hood, beard and dark glasses.</p>
<p>"Early this morning, a male from the Belfast area was arrested," said a police spokesman.</p>
<p>Monday's attack at Lisburn, 10 miles (15 km) from Belfast, was the Irish Republican Army's first attack in Northern Ireland for two years. Thirty-one people were injured and police called it "a deliberate attempt at mass murder."</p>
<p>The attack raised fears that Northern Ireland would be drawn back into the 25-year civil war which claimed more than 3,000 lives if the IRA's pro-British "Loyalist" foes retaliated by ending their two-year ceasefire.</p>
<p>Loyalist political leaders have implored the guerrillas not to return to violence.</p>
<p>Irish Prime Minister John Bruton accused the IRA of trying to disrupt the Loyalist ceasefire.</p>
<p>The Lisburn bombing was "directly and cynically aimed at destabilising the Northern Ireland Loyalist ceasefire...We must not allow the IRA to succeed in this betrayal," Bruton told an emergency debate in the Irish parliament.</p>
<p>The IRA, seeking to oust Britain from Northern Ireland, said the Lisburn attack was intended to put pressure on Britain to allow its political arm, Sinn Fein, into peace talks.</p>
<p>The Combined Loyalist Military Command (CMLC), which rules over the Protestant guerrilla groups, is expected to meet within two days to decide on its reponse.</p>
<p>Its silence since Monday's bombing has encouraged hopes that it will stick to the ceasefire it called in October 1994 to match the IRA's own.</p>
<p>The IRA abandoned its truce on February 9 with the first of a series of bombings on the British mainland, but it had not attacked Northern Ireland until this week.</p>
<p>Bruton stressed that Britain and Ireland would not give in to republican pressure to allow Sinn Fein into the peace talks without an IRA truce.</p>
<p>He also sought to reassure Loyalists that his government had no interest in fulfilling the IRA's dream of a united Ireland unless a majority in the province wanted it.</p>
<p>"We, the people, in the Republic have no agenda of a progressive takeover of Northern Ireland against the wishes of the majority of people there," Bruton said.</p>
<p>"If there ever was such an agenda or mentality here, it has certainly gone."</p>
<p>Bruton called the full-day debate about the Northern Irish peace process in response to the bombing, but parliament is expected to resist pressure to break ties with Sinn Finn.</p>
<p>The Irish Times said the parliament's sub-committee on Northern Ireland had reviewed contacts with Sinn Fein after the IRA claimed responsibility for the attack, but that no change in policy was likely to emerge from the debate.</p>
<p>Bruton banned his ministers from meeting Sinn Fein after the IRA ended its ceasefire, but Irish civil servants have continued to hold meetings with the party.</p>
