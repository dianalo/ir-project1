<p>In a major switch of positions, key environmental groups have opposed a treaty to preserve the world's forests, saying the timing would produce a weak document.</p>
<p>The stand of more than 70 environmental groups at a news conference near the United Nations on Monday makes them an ally of timber lobbies in the United States, if only for the time being.</p>
<p>"There is no clear evidence that a global forest convention is either necessary or desirable," Bill Mankin, director of the Globel Forest Policy Project, said.</p>
<p>"Until more governments implement their existing commitments to protect forests and use them sustainably, it is difficult to have any confidence that they will effectively implement a new convention, whatever its contents," he said.</p>
<p>An intergovernmental committee begins consultations on Tuesday at the United Nations on protecting the world's forests. Canada, the European Union Indonesia and Malaysia want governments to move toward a treaty on forests.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, environmental groups, such as the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the National Wildlife Federation, said that a forest treaty negotiated at this time would be dominated by powerful timber and commercial trade interests and would fail to address their behaviour.</p>
<p>The groups said that national initiatives need to be undertaken first because a treaty at this time would only achieve agreement "on the weakest, lowest-common-denominator commitments."</p>
<p>It would "formalize unacceptably weak forst management standards, thereby giving a global green light to unsustainable forest practices and cippling several existing and stronger forest initiatives," the groups said.</p>
<p>Major timber companies also oppose any kind of a treaty because of fears it would result in inspections by U.N. bodies and result in different standards for countries that sign the treaty compared to those who do not.</p>
