<p>The hardline British National Party, which urges repatriation of immigrants, has declared the May 1 general election a success before it has even happened.</p>
<p>By putting up more than 50 candidates, the BNP qualified under British electoral law for free time to air its message on television and radio channels received in millions of homes.</p>
<p>"We have succeeded by putting up the 50, by getting television and radio time and getting a lot of other publicity," party leader John Tyndall said.</p>
<p>"Whatever our votes are, we'll regard the election as a success," he told Reuters in an interview at his neat house near the seafront in the south coast resort of Brighton.</p>
<p>Success was less than complete, as the minority Channel 4 refused to air the broadcast on Friday because it breached their code of practice. But others did show the film, which featured Tyndall urging voters to back his party's anti-immigration line.</p>
<p>The BNP is putting up 56 election candidates, almost all of whom are expected to lose their 500 pounds ($800) deposits, making the cost to the BNP of its television broadcast 28,000 pounds, or a fraction of what it would cost to buy the time.</p>
<p>Main pillars of the BNP's election platform are an end to non-white immigration and "assisted repatriation" of immigrants.</p>
<p>The party wants Britain to leave the European Union and backs restoration of capital punishment. Homosexual acts would be outlawed and women encouraged to become wives, mothers and home-builders.</p>
<p>Few British parties have attracted as much hate as the BNP, widely accused of fascism, which Tyndall rejects, and racism.</p>
<p>"Racist. It's one of those emotive trigger words, isn't it? What is a racist? Is it someone who hates other races? In that case, the answer is no," saidTyndall, who was jailed in 1986 for inciting racial hatred.</p>
<p>"Or is it someone who puts his own race first, who believes in inherent racial differences? Then yes, we plead guilty."</p>
<p>Tyndall appears to be making a big effort to make the party more respectable.</p>
<p>But, despite denying his activists are responsible for frequent street brawls with militant leftists -- the party's manifesto launch earlier this month degenerated into violence -- it is clear that the old instincts remain.</p>
<p>"The street violence always follows us. We never want it," Tyndall said.</p>
<p>But he added: "If our people are attacked and if the police aren't there to keep order, we defend ourselves. We are not going to tolerate left-wing thuggery."</p>
<p>Tyndall is at pains to distance himself from the neo-Nazi group Combat 18, which specialises in football violence and was recently suspected of sending letter bombs to British sports personalities in mixed-race marriages.</p>
<p>Combat 18, whose name derives from the position in the alphabet of Adolf Hitler's initials, was widely reported to have been set up as the BNP's "boot boy" wing before the two organisations fell out.</p>
<p>Tyndall conceded that a few of his members had "flirted" with Combat 18, but he condemned the group as "morons."</p>
<p>Even if the election does not put a BNP candidate in parliament, Tyndall senses great things ahead.</p>
<p>"We're in this primarily to spread our message," He said. "Some time in the new century is when we expect to become a force in British politics."</p>
