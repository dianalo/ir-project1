<p>Canadian bonds closed stronger on Monday, though spreads to U.S. Treasuries widened, as gains in the U.S. market were partly offset by concern that a U.S. rate hike may hurt the currency, analysts said.</p>
<p>"It was very quiet ahead of tomorrow's (FOMC) meeting. If anything Canadian bonds were reluctant to follow the gains that we saw in Treasuries," said Mary Jane Yule, senior portfolio manager with Jones Heward Investment Counsel. "A lot of that could come from the fact that the dollar weakened.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond rose C$0.33 to C$109.18 to yield 7.214 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond rose 17/32 to yield 6.92 percent. The spread between the two widened to 29 basis points from 28 basis points at Friday's close.</p>
<p>Canadian and U.S. bond markets were trading on lighter than usual volumes, with investors focused on Tuesday's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting Open Market Committee. The FOMC was widely expected to raise rates by 25 basis points when it met on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Analysts said concern about the possible impact of a U.S. rate hike on the Canadian dollar spilled over to the bond market and weighed on prices.  </p>
<p>"The Canadian dollar is going to be at risk, and I think you might find a situation where players not wanting to wait around to see if the Canadian dollar jumps up to C$1.40 decide to book their profits and come out of the Canadian curve," said Andrew Pyle, head of fixed-income research with ABN AMRO Bank Canada.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar ended softer on Monday, surrendering its early gains as investors nervously await an expected hike in U.S. interest rates on Tuesday. The currency finished around C$1.3792 (US$0.7250) after opening stronger at C$1.3754 (US$0.7270).  </p>
<p>Analysts said the Bank of Canada is not expected to match a 25 basis point rise in the U.S. Federal funds rate on Tuesday unless there is a sharp drop in the value of the Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>In other prices, the Government of Canada's 7.0 percent bond due 2006 rose C$0.20 to C$102.85 to yield 6.595. The U.S. bond rose 10/32 to yield 6.71 percent.</p>
<p>The negative spread between the bonds narrowed to 12 basis points from 14 basis points at Friday's close.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill yielded 3.20 percent against its U.S. equivalent which yielded 5.38 percent.</p>
