<p>A U.N. tribunal in The Hague found Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic guilty on Wednesday of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his part in a Serb "ethnic cleansing" campaign against Bosnian Moslems in 1992.</p>
<p>Tadic, 41, looked pale and shocked as he heard presiding judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States pronounce him guilty on 11 counts of persecution and beatings.</p>
<p>The panel of three judges found him not guilty on nine counts of murder -- which encompassed 13 killings -- and declared a further 11 charges inapplicable.</p>
<p>However, he was unanimously convicted of two cold-blooded killings which were not charged as murders, but included under the umbrella persecution charge.</p>
<p>The court accepted evidence that Tadic had stabbed, and cut the throats of, two Moslem policemen outside a church after they had been taken into custody by a group of Serb paramilitaries.</p>
<p>"You have been witness today to justice being done and justice being seen to be done," Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour said in reaction to the verdict.</p>
<p>Arbour said the fact that the two killings fell under a broad charge of systematic ethnic persecution made them even more serious than a simple murder charge.</p>
<p>"A killing motivated by discriminatory views, in my opinion, makes that form of homicide the most heinous, the most objectionable, the very worst form of the taking of human life."</p>
<p>Arbour said the judges' decision on this was consistent with precedents set at Nuremberg where racially motivated killings were properly characterised as crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>The U.N. tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda mark the first attempt to try war criminals before an international panel of judges since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials after World War Two.</p>
<p>Tadic's lawyers said they would appeal the verdict, meaning a likely postponement of the July 1 date set for sentencing.</p>
<p>"Dusan Tadic is not guilty and wants to show he is not guilty," defence counsel Milan Vujin told reporters.</p>
<p>Arbour indicated she, too, might appeal sections of the judgement, stating she had concerns about the stringent burden of proof the judges had imposed in the other murder charges.</p>
<p>The prosecution did not say what sentence it would be seeking, but Arbour said the crimes under consideration would merit extremely severe punishment in any court in the world.</p>
<p>"Virtually all the crimes that are within the jurisdiction of this tribunal, in a domestic situation if proved could attract a life sentence," she said.</p>
<p>Arrested in Germany in February 1994 while visiting family, Tadic has already spent more than three years in custody.</p>
<p>He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment as the tribunal is not allowed to impose the death penalty.</p>
<p>The judgment in the case was the first in a full-length trial since the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia was set up by the U.N. Security Council in May 1993.</p>
<p>During seven months of hearings last year, prosecutors alleged that Tadic had rounded up his former Moslem neighbours in the Prijedor region of northwest Bosnia in 1992 and had tortured, raped and killed them at Serb-run prison camps.</p>
<p>Tadic has always denied the charges and his lawyers said he had been a hapless victim of Moslems' desire to find a scapegoat for their suffering at the hands of the Serbs.</p>
<p>But prosecutors portrayed him as a fervent Serb nationalist who had played an active role in the systematic persecution of Moslems and taken a perverse delight in torture and killing.</p>
<p>The former bar-owner and father of two girls was found guilty of taking part in Serb attacks on his home town of Kozarac and other villages and herding the inhabitants into camps were they were beaten and kept in inuman conditions.</p>
<p>But he was cleared of direct involvement in one of the worst atrocities mentioned in the indictment, in which a prisoner in the notorious Omarska camp was forced to bite off the testicles of another prisoner.</p>
<p>"The (tribunal) is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was on the hangar floor on this occasion...but is not satisfied that he took any active part in the assault and the mutiliation," the judgement said.</p>
<p>Tadic is one of eight war crimes suspects held at the Hague tribunal's 24-cell detention centre, though indictments have been issued against 75 suspects to date.</p>
<p>The former Bosnian Serb political and military leaders, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, both indicted for genocide against the Bosnian Moslems, are among those still at large.</p>
<p>Authorities in various parts of the former Yugoslavia have given only limited cooperation to the tribunal while NATO-led peacekeepers have refused to hunt down and arrest suspects.</p>
