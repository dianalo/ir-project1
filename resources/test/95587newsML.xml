<p>Singapore shares barely stirred in early trading on Thursday with volumes dominated by block trades.</p>
<p>Singapore Telecom (SingTel) saw a total of 871,000 shares crossed between Singapore S$3.152 (US$2.24) and S$3.184.</p>
<p>"Market sentiment on SingTel is mixed. I think there are a lot of people waiting to sell above S$3.20," said a dealer at a local broking house. At 0157 GMT, SingTel was up S$0.02 to S$3.20 on 1.17 million shares, including the crossed deals. Stocks which saw block trades included DBS Land, SIA foreign, Jardine Matheson, Jardine Strategic and Land and General.</p>
<p>After an hour of trading the key Straits Times Industrials Index was off 3.01 to 2,159.88. Market turnover was a slim 12.7 million shares with gainers ahead of losers by 103 to 29.</p>
<p>Dealers said Malaysian over-the-counter stocks were doing a bit better than Singapore shares. Among them was Rashid Hussain, which had been trending firmer this week.</p>
<p>Dealers said some investors bought Rashid Hussain's for its earnings potential and others thought there might be a restructuring which could see the broking house diversifying into other businesses. The stock was up S$0.25 to S$8.90 on 75,000 shares.</p>
<p>US$1.00 = S$1.41</p>
