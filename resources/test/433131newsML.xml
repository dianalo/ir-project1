<p>Small Australian coal miners Cim Resources Ltd, Centennial Coal Co Ltd and Portman Mining Ltd have been rated buys by brokerage J.B. Were and Son.</p>
<p>In a research report sent to clients last month, the brokerage said Portman was in a phase of strong earnings growth and had exceptional brownfields expansion opportunities at its Burton high-margin coking coal mine in Queensland state.  </p>
<p>Centennial, a producer of mainly thermal coal from its four mines in New South Wales state, runs a lean operation and its alliance with South Korean oil refiner Yukong Ltd positioned it well for expansion by acquisition, the report said.</p>
<p>Cim Resources is an emerging coal miner in New South Wales state with low capital, high-margin operations, it said. Cim Resources is poised to expand into Hunter Valley-based soft coking projects, it added.  </p>
<p>The report was prepared when Cim Resources shares stood at A$0.78, Centennial at A$1.74 and Portman at A$2.42. Closing prices on Tuesday were, respectively, A$0.76, A$1.39 and A$2.75.</p>
