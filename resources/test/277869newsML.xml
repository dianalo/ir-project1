<p>Ord Minnett's New Zealand growth indicator has stagnated over the last three months, following a moderate rise after the July 1 tax cuts, Ord Minnett said on Friday.</p>
<p>The indicator rose marginally to 106.0 in November from 105.9 in October, but was down from 109.1 in November 1995.</p>
<p>"The behaviour of the indicator is consistent with our earlier prediction that economic growth would be modest in the second half of 1996, because an overly tight monetary policy would offset much of the stimulatory impact of the tax cuts," Ord Minnett economist Rodney Dickens said.  </p>
<p>He said the indicator was also justification for the sharp fall in interest rates over the last two months. The fall in rates so far would be enough to prompt some acceleration in economic growth by the June 1997 quarter, which would be helped by higher government spending.</p>
<p>Further interest rate falls were likely in the March quarter, particularly in the short-term wholesale rates which determine floating mortgage interest rates, he said.  </p>
<p>"The data on economic growth in the first few months of next year should should continue to point to modest growth, which should prompt the market/Reserve Bank to allow bank bill yields to fall further."</p>
<p>Dickens said it was possible interest rates would be allowed to fall enough to prompt the New Zealand dollar to depreciate by two to five percent in the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>"If this occurs, which we are currently predicting, then there will be a strong acceleration in economic growth in the second half of next year," he said.</p>
