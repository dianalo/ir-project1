<p>Yen-based Tokyo precious metals futures ended lower across the board on Monday, hit by a sharp fall in the New York market on Friday and a stronger yen against the dollar today, traders said.</p>
<p>All silver futures were glued to their daily limit-lows throughout the day, pressured by weak spot silver prices.</p>
<p>Daily price fluctuations in silver futures are limited to six yen per 10 grams.</p>
<p>Benchmark April silver closed six yen weaker at 178.5 yen.</p>
<p>Gold futures ranged from 24 yen to 28 yen per gram weaker. Most-active benchmark April ended 26 yen down at 1,275 yen.  </p>
<p>Traders tended to be bearish on gold futures, as sentiment in bullion was dented by news last week that Germany planned to revalue its gold reserves.</p>
<p>Spot gold was quoted at $343.25/75 per ounce at 0733 GMT, against $343.80/344.30 in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>Platinum futures were hit by animated selling pressure, while losses in palladium futures were limited because spot market tightness has shown little sign of easing, traders said.</p>
<p>"Market players were building fresh shorts in platinum futures in anticipation that Russia may resume platinum group metals (PGM) exports," one trader said.  </p>
<p>However, traders said that there had been little progress in Japan-Russia PGM export contract talks, since last week when the Russian platinum group metal agency (Almazjuvelirexport) informed Japanese clients that PGM exports would resume soon.</p>
<p>Platinum futures may head lower in an attempt to correct the recent rally, while a large overhang of short positions in TOCOM palladium futures may limit palladium's losses even if Russia resumes exports, the trader said.</p>
<p>Benchmark April palladium ended eight yen per gram weaker at 592 yen. Benchmark April platinum stood 33 yen per gram lower at 1,398 yen. -- Tokyo Commodity Desk</p>
