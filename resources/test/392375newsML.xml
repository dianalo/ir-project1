<p>South Korea's crude oil imports rose 21 percent to 76.2 million barrels in January against 63 million barrels in January 1996, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Local refiners spent $1.78 billion in crude purchases last month compared with $1.16 billion in January 1996.</p>
<p>But the country's imports of oil products fell 38 percent to 13.2 million barrels from 21.3 million. The refiners paid $411 million in January versus $502 million a year before.</p>
