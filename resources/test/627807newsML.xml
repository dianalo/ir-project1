<p>The Australian Opposition said on Friday that the Senate, the upper house of parliament, would prevent the government from cutting automotive tariffs.</p>
<p>The Senate had demonstrated its hostility to lower tariffs earlier in the week when it passed a movtion calling for a 15 percent floor on tariffs until at least 2005, Labor industry spokesman Simon Crean said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Any move to to cut automotive tariffs below 15 percent requires legislation," Crean said. "And as was clearly demonstrated in the Senate this week, the government doesn't have the numbers on this issue," he said.  </p>
<p>The tariff on automotive imports is currently 22.5 percent and will fall to 15 percent in 2000.</p>
<p>The Productivity Commission, a government think-tank, recommended a further fall to five percent by 2005 in a draft report issued last year.</p>
<p>The government will receive the final report next week after which it will state its policy.</p>
