<headline>Dry weather spurs more Kansas harvesting, seeding.</headline>
<dateline>TOPEKA, Kan. 1996-10-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dry weather during the week ended Sunday allowed Kansas farmers to continue seeding and fall harvesting, the weekly state crop report said.</p>
<p>The wheat crop is equal with last year's seeding pace of 82 percent, but behind the five-year average of 86 percent. Wheat has emerged on 44 percent of the acreage, compared to 42 percent last year and the average of 53 percent.</p>
<p>Harvest continues, but in some cases farmers are waiting for grain to dry to acceptable moisture levels. Corn was 53 percent harvested versus 40 last year and the average of 63 percent.</p>
<p>Corn was rated 84 percent good to excellent, versus 85 percent at that level a week ago. Sorghum was rated 87 percent good to excellent, versus 85 percent at that level a week ago.</p>
<p>Twenty-five percent of the sorghum acreage was harvested, versus 22 a year ago and the average of 33 percent. Sorghum was 83 percent mature, versus 79 a year ago and on average.</p>
<p>Soybeans were rated 83 percent good to excellent, versus 87 at that level a year ago. Thirty percent of soybeans were harvested, versus 27 last year and an average of 46 percent.</p>
<p>Pasture condition was rated 75 percent good to excellent, versus 76 last week.</p>
