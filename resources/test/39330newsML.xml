<p>Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said on Saturday that a European Union delegation wanted to visit the PLO in disputed East Jerusalem, despite strenuous opposition from Israel.</p>
<p>Spring told reporters during an informal foreign ministers' meeting that an EU "troika" of Ireland, the Netherlands and Italy wanted to abide by an earlier EU decision to visit the Palestine Liberation Organisation at the city's Orient House.</p>
<p>"I certainly feel we should stick by the...decision," Spring said. "We want to make a contribution to the Middle East peace process and it is important that we keep a balance in our relations with the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority."</p>
<p>Irish officials suggested that if the Israeli government tried to prevent the visit, the fact-finding mission to Israel could be cancelled.</p>
<p>"If it's not Orient House, there is no point in going," one official said.</p>
<p>Spring's comments followed a visit by Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy to Dublin in which he had urged Ireland, the current EU president, not to go ahead with the Orient House trip.</p>
<p>No date has yet been set for the visit to Israel.</p>
<p>Levy said on Friday he understood from his meetings in Dublin that the EU woulld not send any delegations to Orient House, which he also said PLO President Yasser Arafat had agreed to close.</p>
<p>Israel regards foreign visits to Orient House as supporting PLO demands to make East Jerusalem the capital of a future Palestinian state. The city's fate is to be negotiated at final peace talks between the two sides.</p>
<p>Spring has said that he wants the informal foreign ministers meeting being held in his home region to focus on ways the EU can further the Middle East peace process.</p>
