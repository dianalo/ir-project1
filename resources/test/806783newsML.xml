<p>Advest Inc analyst Gloria Vogel downgraded eight insurance stocks based on their valuations and deteriorating industry fundamentals, the firm said.</p>
<p>Vogel cut Allied Group Inc, American Bankers Insurance Group Inc and Provident Cos Inc to hold from buy, Advest said.</p>
<p>She cut Allstate Corp and USF&amp;G Corp to hold from accumulate and she cut American General Corp, Reliance Group Holdings Inc and St. Paul Cos Inc to accumulate from buy, the firm said.  </p>
<p>In a research report, Vogel said insurance stocks are generally trading near the upper end of their typical valuation ranges, despite Friday's market drop, and she said it is becoming harder to find any cheap stocks.</p>
<p>"Given highly competitive industry conditions and likely margin pressure, we suggest some profit taking within the insurance sector at this time, especially among those issues that have significantly outperformed to date," she said in the report.</p>
<p>She said she currently prefers stocks with above-average dividend yields.  </p>
<p>Therefore, she said she was giving American General, Reliance and St. Paul a higher rating than some of the other insurance stocks.</p>
<p>She said Seibels Bruce Group Inc remains her only buy rated stock because it is still fairly cheap and is not widely followed by Wall Street.</p>
<p>Other stocks that appear attractively valued include Acceptance Insurance Cos Inc, EMC Insurance Group Inc and LaSalle Re Holdings Ltd.</p>
<p>If the stock market moved higher, she said she expects the insurance stock sector would follow.</p>
<p>"Nonetheless, any signs of inflation or rising interest rates will hammer the stocks downward," she said in the report.</p>
<p>"Coupled with the potential for catastrophe losses in this quarter, we are concerned enough about current valuations to lower some ratings on our existing stock universe," she said.</p>
