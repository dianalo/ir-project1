<p>Latest European Union figures show grain export commitments between July 1 and September 17 were nearly 40 percent below their year-ago level, member-country officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The figures, based on delivered export certificates, showed grain sales plunged to 3.392 million tonnes from 5.599 million.</p>
<p>Commercial wheat exports fell to 742,000 tonnes from 2.362 million tonnes although heavy export commitments to China had driven up export figures at the start of the 1995/96 campaign.</p>
<p>Flour export commitments reached 997,000 tonnes against 1.471 million tonnes during the same period last year.</p>
<p>But commercial barley exports rose to 1.089 million tonnes from 632,000 tonnes, helped by sales to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Since September 17, the EU has granted 250,970 tonnes of soft wheat, 351,061 tonnes of barley and 52,892 tonnes of rye exports through its weekly grain tender system. --Paris newsroom +331 4221 5432</p>
