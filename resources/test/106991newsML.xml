<p>Irish engineering and shipping company Jones Group Plc said on Wednesday that its overall trading outcome will represent an improvement and its net results, while satisfactory, would be in line with expectations.</p>
<p>Jones said in a statement that it was satisfied with the progress which had been made in taking action to deal with the grave problems which had become apparent in the group last year.</p>
<p>The company said the manufacturing division where the difficulties were concentrated was on course but would be loss-making this year.  </p>
<p>"Its future is contingent on the full implementation of its programme for change," chief executive Pat Nevin said.</p>
<p>Jones said the shipping and distribution divisions were expected to achieve their targeted results.</p>
<p>Earlier, Jones announced a pre-tax loss of 2.40 million Irish pounds for the six months to June 30, 1996.</p>
<p>The group recorded an operating profit of 0.57 million punts compared with 0.97 million punts for the same period in 1995.</p>
<p>Jones said the fall in profits arose largely from the serious problems in the manufacturing division.  </p>
<p>"Radical action involving very substantial costs and a total reorganisation of the manufacturing division have been required," Nevin said.</p>
<p>"This process is continuing and further difficult decisions remain to be implemented if the long-term viability of the operation is to be secured," he added.</p>
<p>Jones said weak demand in the UK for the manufacturing divisions' products had compounded its difficulties.</p>
<p>In the shipping division, the sale of the vessel, the Rathnew, generated a satisfactory capital profit but also caused a marginal drop in earnings, the company said.  </p>
<p>Jones said the Rahtrowan, the Rathkyle and the Rathmoy had all operated effectively on their respective charters.</p>
<p>In the distribution division, Jones Oil traded ahead of expectations as a prolonged winter increased demand in Ireland.</p>
<p>Jones said strong volume growth had also been achieved in the UK by Minster Fuels and Hardy Craske but intense competition reduced margins.</p>
<p>"A radical cost reduction programme implemented in late 1995 and early this year in Blugas achieved the targeted improvement in its results," Nevin said.</p>
<p>Jones said the group had bought out the minority interest in Appian Fasteners and that company had shown satisfactory growth.</p>
