<p>July rose five to 3,304, September rose 10 to 3,260, the January 1998 contract fell 15 to 3,225, and March lost 20 to 3,260. Combined volume fell to 18,300 tonnes from 21,300.</p>
<p>Soybeans opened mixed and moved around the opening level for the whole session, traders said.  </p>
<p>"Investors were not willing to build large fresh positions on a lack of fresh market-moving news," a trader said.</p>
<p>"Many investors also believe the short-term trend is not optimistic," he said.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected soybeans to fall slightly in dull trading early next week.</p>
