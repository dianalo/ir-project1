<p>The won rose against the dollar on Friday as banks unwound dollar positions on the belief that the won would continue to strengthen, dealers said.</p>
<p>The won closed at 818.10, after opening at 819.10. It ranged from 817.60 to 819.30.</p>
<p>"The dollar is overbought at the moment," said a western bank dealer. "The central bank's insistent intervention just above the 820 level convinced players that it is serious about supporting the won. So some foreign banks began unwinding their dollar positions."</p>
