<p>The Hungarian share market advanced to a new record in slow trade on Monday despite a fall in oil and gas company MOL shares after the Industry and Trade Ministry announced the quarterly energy price hikes.</p>
<p>The BUX index finished at a preliminary 6,488.63 points, up 28.50 points or 0.44 percent.</p>
<p>"There weren't any driving factors on the market, with the only news on MOL," said Gyorgy Czipo of ING Barings. "Apparently, the rise remained slightly below market expectations."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism said earlier today Hungary would raise gas prices at an average rate of 11.3 percent and electricity prices by 4.5 percent on July 1.</p>
<p>The 11.3 percent remained below the upper end of 17 percent of market expectations on the size of the rise.</p>
<p>MOL finished at 4,040 forints, down 50.</p>
<p>On the futures market BUX indices declined in slow trade reflecting the lack of fresh incentive in spot trade.</p>
<p>"BUX futures prices reflect a wait-and-see stance with expectations of minor declines on the market," said Gyorgy Durucz of WestLB Investment.</p>
<p>On Monday's cash market, retailer Csopak closed 70 forints higher at 2,900 forints, after London-based ICE Securities started its coverage with a 'buy' rating.</p>
<p>Meat processor Pick Szeged was suspended for the day after Pick on Monday denied a report in daily Nepszabadsag that it had won a privatisation tender for its competitor Ringa Rt.</p>
<p>The BUX index on Monday hit a new record high but an analyst said she expected a virtually flat market over the summer period.</p>
<p>"Still there doesn't seem too much driving it (the market)," said Frances Cloud, analyst at Nomura Equity Research in London.</p>
<p>"I think everybody accepts that the market is generally speaking pretty expensive, but noone really wants to sell anything, they just sit in their holdings," she added.</p>
