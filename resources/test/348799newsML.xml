<p>Short-term interbank rates continued to slide as liquidity improved and many banks realised they have maintained more than required fund levels for the two major festivals next month, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said one-week money was the biggest loser, falling to 6.50/80 percent against 6.90/7.00 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Most other rates were mostly unchanged.  </p>
<p>Two-week money was at 7.00/15 percent, one-month at 7.25/30 and three-month and six-month at 7.25/30, all unchanged from their previous levels.</p>
<p>"Many seem to have either overborrowed or because a large part of cash withdrawals for the festivals is over, there is a lot of short-term money floating around," a dealer with a Malaysian bank said.</p>
<p>He said many banks were borrowing long-term and keeping the funds at the short-end in anticipation of further withdrawals for the Moslem Eid al-Fitr and Chinese Lunar New Year festivals in February.  </p>
<p>He said pressure on the monetary system was also coming off due to fresh overseas funds inflows.</p>
<p>An estimated three billion ringgit is expected to temporarily go out of the banking system during the twin celebrations, dealers said.</p>
<p>One dealer said the trend could be disturbed if there were any unexpectedly sharp cash withdrawals next week.</p>
<p>"The next few weeks will be a test for Bank Negara's tight monetary policy. Funds will return to the banking system from the retail sector, and overseas funds are expected to return to the ringgit," said a dealer with another local bank.</p>
