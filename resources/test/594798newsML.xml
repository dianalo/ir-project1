<title>MALAYSIA: Esso Malaysia sees weak refining margins.</title>

<p>Esso Malaysia Bhd  expects refining margins to remain weak in the near term due to strong competition within Southeast Asia, Philip Dingle, Esso Malaysia chairman and chief executive officer, said on Monday.</p>
<p>"There is no quick solution to that, but one must bear in mind that once you start investing in the oil and gas sector the returns are for longer-term, not immediate term," the national Bernama news agency quoted Dingle as saying after Esso's annual meeting.</p>
<p>Esso officials could not immediately be reached for confirmation.</p>
<p>Dingle said when refining margins return to more normal levels the company's increased capacity will provide the opportunity to increase profits. An overhang of surplus refining capacity in Asia has dampened refining margins for many companies.</p>
<p>He said that although it was too early to make a forecast due to the depressed margins, Esso Malaysia was confident of better results this year, based on the increase in sales.</p>
<p>For the year ended December 31, 1996, Esso reported pre-tax profits of 66.68 million ringgit versus 91.09 million in the previous year. Turnover rose to 2.17 billion ringgit from 1.77 billion a year go.</p>
<p>Dingle said sales of clean products such as gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas and distillates had increased about eight percent in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>He added that Esso Extreme, a new unleaded gasoline formulation introduced last year, had received a positive response and was expected to contribute 10 to 20 percent of the company's total sales.</p>
