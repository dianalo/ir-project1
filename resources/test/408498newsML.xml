<p>A $7 million conduit debt issue for a Catholic high school sailed through the Chicago City Council Wednesday on a 42 to 2 vote.</p>
<p>But the issue may still face a challenge from the Chicago office of the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>
<p>The tax-exempt, variable-rate note deal for De La Salle High School on Chicago's south side was the first conduit financing approved by the city for a religious-based school. The notes will be backed by a letter of credit from Northern Trust Bank and sold through George K. Baum &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Valerie Phillips, public information director for the ACLU, said the group was concerned the issue will violate constitutional principles governing the separation of church and state.</p>
<p>"It has the potential of putting the city in the position of sponsoring and endorsing religious education," she said.</p>
<p>Phillips added that the ACLU needed to review the debt financing and construction plans for the high school before deciding its next move.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the deal would be used to build a sports center and for other improvements, according to Anthony Fratto, a senior vice president at George K. Baum. He has also said the school plans to use pledged funds and grants to pay off the notes.</p>
<p>Fratto and city officials have pointed out that the Illinois Development Finance Authority has issued tax-exempt bonds in the past for religious-based schools on a conduit basis.</p>
<p>According to the state authority, more than $38 million of bonds have been  sold for three religious-based high schools.</p>
