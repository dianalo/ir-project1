<p>The third and final cricket test between England and New Zealand was set for an exciting finish at Lancaster Park in the final session on Tuesday.</p>
<p>At tea, England were 257 for six, requiring 305 to win, another 48 runs with four wickets standing.</p>
<p>John Crawley was on 13, after 78 minutes at the crease, and Dominic Cork was on 16.</p>
<p>England appeared to have the match under control at lunch when they were 203 for three.</p>
<p>However, New Zealand captured three wickets in the space of 16 balls to climb back into the game.</p>
<p>Captain Mike Atherton, having completed his 11th test century, edged a catch to wicketkeeper Adam Parore off medium pacer Nathan Astle to end his stand at 118 runs.</p>
<p>He had batted 399 minutes, faced 311 balls and hit 11 fours.</p>
<p>Atherton and Nasser Hussain added 80 in 179 balls to put England on course for victory.</p>
<p>Hussain was then caught at silly mid-off four balls later off left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori for 33, and Graham Thorpe hit a return catch back to Vettori shortly after.</p>
<p>Vettori, in just his fourth first-class match, had bowled a marathon 53 overs and had taken four for 83.</p>
<p>New Zealand need to win the test to square the three-match rubber after losing the second test.</p>
