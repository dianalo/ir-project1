<p>Ten people were killed and 37 injured in western Turkey on Thursday in a highway pile-up caused by heavy fog, the state-run Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>The accident took place in the early morning hours on the road outside Bandirma, 100 km (60 miles) south of Istanbul, Anatolian said.  No further details were available.</p>
<p>Much of western Turkey has been plagued by fog in recent days, temporarily closing Istanbul's airport and disrupting shipping through the busy Bosphorus straits.</p>
<p>Turkey's roads are among the most dangerous in the world. About 88,000 people have been killed in accidents over the past 12 years, more than four times the number of dead in the same period from the Kurdish insurgency in the eastern provinces.</p>
