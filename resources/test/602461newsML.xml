<p>Canadian bonds opened stronger on Wednesday, sharply outperforming U.S. treasuries as further gains in the Canadian dollar and optimism about its prospects helped boost bond prices, analysts said.</p>
<p>"A strong currency for the moment is going to be good for the bonds. A lot of the offshore play on bonds is inevitably a currency play when you're at these kinds of levels in yields," said Jim Webber, director of fixed-income research with TD Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond rose C$0.28 to C$112.10 to yield 6.984 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond fell 10/32 to yield of 6.93 percent. The spread between the bonds narrowed to five basis points from 11 basis points at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar began rallying yesterday after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its decision to hold rates steady. There had been concern a U.S. rate hike would weigh on the dollar. The Canadian dollar strengthened further overnight, opening at C$1.3626 (US$0.7338) this morning..</p>
<p>"Clearly (the bond strength) is interrelated with the Canadian dollar," said Rod Kerr, a bond portfolio manager with Laketon Investment Management.  </p>
<p>Optimism surrounding the prospects for the Canadian dollar as a result of the Fed decision should help Canadian bonds outperform further in coming sessions, Webber said. He said he expected the entire Canadian yield curve would soon trade through the U.S. curve for the first time in history.</p>
<p>"The heat is completely off the Bank of Canada here," said Webber. "We don't have to test the proposition about whether the Bank would have followed the Fed because there's nothing to follow."  </p>
<p>In other prices, Canada's 10-year benchmark bond rose C$0.19 to C$103.97 to yield 6.435 percent. The U.S. 10-year bond fell 5/32 to yield 6.70 percent.</p>
<p>The negative spread between the two bonds widened to 27 basis points from 21 basis points at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill traded with a yield of 2.98 percent against its U.S. equivalent, which yielded 5.17 percent.</p>
