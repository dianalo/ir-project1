<p>Amnesty International said on Friday that more than 600 people were reported to have disappeared in northern Sri Lanka in the past year and described the problem as outrageous.</p>
<p>It said in a statement from London that since government forces captured the northern Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) stronghold of Jaffna peninsula between late 1995 and early 1996 the total number of disappearances reported to it had reached 648, the highest since 1990.</p>
<p>"That more than 600 'disappearances' can occur in one year despite the government's claim that it is addressing the problem is outrageous," Amnesty said in a statement from London.</p>
<p>"This highlights the need for action to be taken now -- to prevent these violations from continuing," it said.</p>
<p>Sri Lankan foreign ministry officials said the government had set up a board of investigation in November last year as a response to the complaints.</p>
<p>"Several of the cases which have been identified are being investigated and some of those suspected are already under trial," one official said.</p>
<p>"The ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) has acknowledged since the initial reports concerning these alleged disppearances that the number of cases has not escalated," he added.</p>
<p>Amnesty and other human rights groups have accused Sri Lankan security forces of widespread human rights violations in the campaign against the LTTE.</p>
<p>The LTTE have been fighting since 1983 for an independent homeland for minority Tamils Sri Lanka's north and east.</p>
<p>Human rights groups have also said some 60,000 people died or disappeared in the brutal campaign by the former United National Party government to crush a left-wing youth uprising in the south in 1988-1990.</p>
<p>The People's Alliance government, elected in 1994, has said it has cracked down on human rights abuses by security forces.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka told the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva on Thursday that the government had condemned rights violations and brought the guilty to book.</p>
<p>Bernard Goonetillake, leader of the Sri Lankan delegation to the Commission's session, said in a speech that Sri Lanka had set up an independent human rights commission to look into reports of violations and that a new constitution, currently in the works, would give additional fundamental rights to the people.</p>
<p>Amnesty also said the U.N. Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances had reported that in 1990 it received 4,774 complaints from Sri Lanka but the figure had fallen to 36 in 1995.</p>
