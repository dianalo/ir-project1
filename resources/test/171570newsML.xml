<p>Belgian airline Sabena said its union representatives, management and Belgium's employment minister Miet Smet had signed a social agreement late Tuesday on Sabena's Horizon 1998 profit restoration plan.</p>
<p>"Thanks to the signature of this accord all Sabena staff will be able to devote themselves entirely to the satisfaction of clients...," Sabena president and chief executive officer Paul Reutlinger said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Horizon 1998 plan, negotiated over six months, involves two billion Belgian francs worth of savings from staff through job and pay cuts and increased flexibility.  </p>
<p>"In the coming months Sabena will put into place a vast programme...aimed at improving our product further in terms of punctuality, airport facilities, cabin comfort and service," the statement added.</p>
<p>Sabena, which is 49.5 percent owned by Swissair, would also launch an international advertising campaign, as part of a wider communication policy.</p>
<p>Agreement on a draft deal with the trade unions had been reached last week. Sabena pilots, which had gone on strike on Thursday in protest at the plan were convinced later in the day to end their action.</p>
