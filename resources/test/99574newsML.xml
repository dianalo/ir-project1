<p>The United States will repatriate any illegal migrants found aboard a crippled Chinese ship carrying 109 people that is now being towed toward Bermuda, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>Bob Farmer, U.S. Consul General in Bermuda, and Quinton Edness, Bermuda's Minister of Home Affairs, told a news conference no one would be allowed to stay in Bermuda once the ship reaches the British-run territory.</p>
<p>"No passenger or crew member will be allowed off the ship until their final destination has been determined. All necessary equipment, including handcuffs, are on board the ship," Farmer said.</p>
<p>The cargo ship Xing Da, carrying 83 passengers and 26 crew, was being toward toward Bermuda by the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Reliance and was expected to arrive in Hamilton at about 10 a.m. ADT (1300 GMT) on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Members of the U.S. Marine Corps, Coast Guard and Immigration and Naturalization Service were on board the Xing Da, and Reliance had an 80-member crew, Farmer said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard had found the ship on Saturday about 150 miles (240 km) off Bermuda. Officials said the passengers and crew had been aboard since June.</p>
<p>Farmer and Edness said those aboard Xing Da would be taken to a detention center in the Bahamas, at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba or possibly on Wake Island in the Pacific. They said the passengers eventually would be repatriated to China and that the crew and any migrant smugglers would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</p>
<p>They said the ship itself likely would be taken to the United States for disposal.</p>
<p>Officials said those on board the Xing Da were not in need of emergency medical care, but some were dehydrated. Water was flown to the ship.</p>
