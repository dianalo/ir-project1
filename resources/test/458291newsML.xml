<headline>French stocks drop sharply at opening.</headline>

<p>Losses flooded CAC-40 stocks at Thursday's opening, with the blue chip index starting down 0.99 percent. Traders said there was scope for profit-taking as today is the last day of this month's trading account.</p>
<p>Markets are also cautious over possible U.S. interest rate tightening on March 25 and sharp falls in bond markets.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 29.86 points or 1.15 percent at 2,566.91 at 0918 GMT while the CAC-40 futures contract was down 28 at 2,572 from Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>Volume was over 540 million francs.</p>
<p>There was little appetite to buy French stocks in anticipation of the new account in the uncertain climate in German and U.S. markets, said a broker. Investors are eyeing the 2,530-2,550 area on the CAC index as a buying zone.</p>
<p>Despite the sharp drop in share prices, there has been no big increase in trading volumes and the consolidation was fairly orderly. Profit-taking on dollar-exposure stocks or companies reporting disappointing results led the falls.</p>
<p>LVMH reverses earlier loss, up 0.99 percent to 1,323. The luxury goods and drinks company earlier reported a 1996 net attributable profit of 3.68 billion francs, lower than market estimates.</p>
<p>Alcatel Alsthom falls 2.33 percent to 670, as investors booked profits after strong gains prompted by 1996 results.</p>
<p>Elf Aquitaine, another CAC heavyweight, drops 2.33 percent to 546, amid profit-taking.</p>
<p>Lafarge, another stock which has risen on the back of recent dollar strengthening, now is also hit by profit-taking. The stock was down 3.82 percent at 375.1 francs.</p>
<p>Renault swerves into loss, down 3.26 percent at 133.5 francs, after recent rises. Market estimates for 1996 net losses, due to be announced later today, range between 4.5 billion-six billion francs.</p>
