<p>H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. plans to meet with its advisors this weekend to plot its next move in the battle for Great Western Financial Corp.</p>
<p>While Ahmanson officials would not comment on their strategy, industry analysts widely expect the thrift to soon raise its bid to counter a definitive pact between Great Western and white knight Washington Mutual Savings Bank.</p>
<p>"Clearly, we'll hear something from Ahmanson in the next few days regarding a sweetened bid," said Todd Pitsinger, analyst with Friedman, Billings and Ramsey.</p>
<p>"We're meeting (this weekend) and getting ready for Monday," said a source near Ahmanson, which meets investors in New York on Monday to compare its $6.1 billion bid to Washington Mutual's $6.7 billion bid.</p>
<p>The focus at the meeting will be on Washington Mutual's cost and earnings projections, considered dubious by Ahmanson, the source said. He also said advisors this weekend will look over the $400 million in cost savings originally projected in Ahmanson's bid, indicating some changes might be made.</p>
<p>Several analysts also expect that Ahmanson may revise its projections in an effort to curry investors' favour.</p>
<p>"We still believe Ahmanson's initial projections were conservative as its cost savings assumptions appear to have been modest given the substantial overlap that exists between the two operations," said David Hochstim of Bear Stearns.</p>
<p>"If Ahmanson uses assumptions more similar to those used by Washington Mutual, it could produce materially higher expected earnings growth," Hochstim said.</p>
<p>What will ultimately determine the winner of the battle for Great Western is the way Wall Street perceives each bid, since each of the offers are valued on the stock of the bidders.</p>
<p>"To the extent the market perceives one side's outlook as stronger, the price of a bid can fluctuate," said Leslie Nelkin of Furman Selz. "I anticipate that Monday will simply be an opportunity for Ahmanson to inject greater credibility with their projections," he said.</p>
<p>Great Western declined comment on Monday's meeting. "We're expecting Ahmanson to attack on every front," said a source close to Great Western.</p>
<p>Washington Mutual has offered 0.9 of its shares, or $47.60 a share, for each Great Western share, while Ahmanson's bid of 1.05 shares, is valued at $44.24 a share Friday.</p>
<p>Washington Mutual's proven track record for making successful acquisitions should strengthen its hand, analysts said. Its $1.6 billion acquisition of American Savings Bank last year gave it a toehold in California.</p>
<p>"Washington Mutual's stock is a higher currency based on its performance and a firm deal on the table that's higher," said Pitsinger.</p>
<p>Whether or not Washington Mutual is overstating its revneue projections, Ahmanson has to sweeten its offer a signficant amount to elicit a favourable response from Great western and its shareholders, he said.</p>
