<p>Mayor Richard Daley, expressing outrage over the apparent racist beating of a young black by white toughs, called on Chicagoans Thursday to "denounce this mindless act of violence and hatred."</p>
<p>In an editorial published on the front page of the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper, Daley called last week's beating of 13-year-old Lenard Clark "a terrible tragedy for his family -- and for all of Chicago.</p>
<p>"I call on all Chicagoans to join together to denounce this mindless act of violence and hatred and to join together in support of his family," Daley wrote.</p>
<p>Clark remained comatose in a hospital with severe head injuries sustained when he was knocked off his bicycle and beaten late Friday, allegedly by three white youths who later bragged that they were keeping blacks out of their South Side neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The three, two high school students at De La Salle Institute aged 17 and 18 and a recent graduate aged 19, were charged with attempted murder and committing hate crimes. They remained free on bond.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers said the three did not participate in the attack and were arrested by police in what they called a rush to judgment because of the case's highly charged nature.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department in Chicago said federal prosecutors were monitoring the case.</p>
<p>A peace march led by black community leaders was planned for Thursday near where Clark was attacked in Bridgeport, a traditionally Irish American neighbourhood where Daley was born and raised and a symbol of the city's persistent racial segregation. Few blacks live in Bridgeport although an increasing number of Asians and Hispanics have moved there.</p>
<p>Daley is the son of the former political boss and mayor Richard J. Daley, who as a youth from Bridgeport and a member of the Hamburg Club was thought to have participated in the city's legendary 1919 race riot.</p>
<p>The mayor urged parents and other adults to be responsible for not tolerating racist attitudes and teaching their children the importance of diversity. He had criticised adults at a high school basketball game this month for not putting a stop to the game when whites in the audience taunted a black player on the opposing team with chants of "Buckwheat."</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Rev. Jesse Jackson led a spirited prayer assembly at Brother Rice Catholic high school, where the taunting occurred, and urged the all-male student body to "heal the breach" of racism.</p>
<p>Police were out in force around the park near Bridgeport where Clark and two friends were attacked after playing basketball. Clark was pitched head-first into a brick wall, then kicked and punched, witnesses told police.</p>
