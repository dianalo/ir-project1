<p>Prices in sterling show little change, despite firming in Australian fine merino wool values this week, leading to a new seasonal peak for the eastern market indicator.</p>
<p>Currency strength explains the limited movement in local prices. Traders also say that opportunities for selling overseas are somewhat decreasing where order books are running down.</p>
<p>Home trade demand is not as bad as the export side but it is very competitive and imports are attracted by currency alignments.</p>
<p>Deliveries are going out fairly well for home and export. British wool prices softened for some types this week and business in the sector is dull with recent New Zealand weakness unhelpful. The proposal to buy the entire Australian stockpile is not being taken very seriously in view of the market distortion that would follow. - - London Newsroom 00 44 171 542 7729</p>
