<p>After taking the world of haute couture by storm, flamboyant American luxury fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi said he wished to dabble next in entertainment.</p>
<p>Mizrahi, in Singapore to launch his collection, told Reuters he was on the verge of stepping into a new frontier -- the world of entertainment -- which would "accentuate and enhance" his image as a designer and an artist.</p>
<p>"I have aspiration in the entertainment industry. I (will) like very much to expand in that industry. I am going in that direction. I think they are very related industries. I can't do one without the other," the 35-year-old Mizrahi said in an interview.</p>
<p>Dressed in a white T-shirt and a self-labelled dark suit sans his signature bandana, Mizrahi said the move would not interfere with his primary high fashion career.</p>
<p>The man who gained attention for his offbeat sense of colour and whimsical designs early in his career, said he believes everything is achievable in life if one follows the heart.</p>
<p>"It will not interfere with my designing. As a designer and an artist, everything you do adds to your work, your product and your clothes...it's an education," Mizrahi said, alluding to his designs in entertainment.</p>
<p>"It gives me a lot of inspiration, influence and motivation to make my clothes (in) a certain way. If I don't do it, it would be so frustrating that I couldn't continue doing my clothing. It's debilitating not to be able to do what you want," he said.</p>
<p>Mizrahi, who has received a number of offers from the entertainment industry, said he was undecided if his venture into movies would be in production, script-writing or acting.</p>
<p>MIZRAHI "UNZIPPED" HIGHLY PUBLICISED</p>
<p>"My job is not only to create fashion but culture. I want to create an awareness of what I think people should be thinking about and looking like," he said, adding that environmental conservation was one issue he wished to advance.</p>
<p>A graduate of New York's Parsons School of Design, Mizrahi made his feature debut in 1994, in a Michael J. Fox comedy, "For the Love of Money", playing a fashion designer.</p>
<p>In 1995, he was the main feature of the highly publicised documentary "Unzipped", which showed him cavorting with supermodels and fashion editors.</p>
<p>Mizrahi made the movie with director-photographer Douglas Keeve.</p>
<p>He also created costumes for theatre, ballet and films, including Spike Lee's "Jungle Fever", earning himself accolades from the retail and fashion world.</p>
<p>Mizrahi said he would be completing a book of fiction on the fashion industry to be published towards the end of the year.</p>
<p>On the secret of his drive and success, Mizrahi said that he culled inspiration or "revelations" from films and ballet, and by living life to its fullest.</p>
<p>"In fashion designing, I don't believe in the tail wagging the dog. I'm the dog that wags the tail," he said.</p>
<p>His company saw "phenomenal growth" in recent years, notably from the launch of the secondary collection of IS**C and expansion into lucrative Asian markets.</p>
<p>The alliance with Singapore's high fashion retailer and distributor, F.J. Benjamin, will add to his presence in Asia.</p>
<p>MIZRAHI TO UNVEIL NEW PRODUCTS</p>
<p>Mizrahi's main collection will also introduce new products later this year, such as dining sets, menswear, accessories, fragrances and casual clothes. This is in addition to the shoes and eyewear that were introduced a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>In defining the woman he designs his clothing for, Mizrahi said she would be ageless and active, funny and colourful.</p>
<p>She will appreciate the past and future but live for the moment.</p>
<p>"She has a sense of joy, living life, realising that you never have a chance to re-do it," Mizrahi said.</p>
