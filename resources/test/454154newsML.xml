<p>Researchers said on Tuesday they have discovered a gene that suppresses tumor growth and could lead to better ways to diagnose and treat certain forms of brain and kidney cancer.</p>
<p>The cancer-fighting properties of the gene, known as cx43, were discovered by doctors at Northwest Hospital's Deke Slayton Center for Brain Cancer Studies in Seattle, who found the gene was not present in brain tumors. When they inserted the gene back into cancer cultures, the growth of the tumor cells was slowed dramatically.</p>
<p>Dr. Alton Boynton, director of the department of molecular medicine at the Deke Slayton Center, said the gene appears to work by producing a protein that forms so-called gap junctions between cells. The gap junctions promote normal cell growth, and their absence can lead to the proliferation of cancer cells.</p>
<p>"It's like when you come to a stoplight and it's either red, green or yellow, and everything is very well-regulated. But then, when the protein disappears, there is no longer a stoplight and all chaos breaks loose," Boynton explained.</p>
<p>He said the research team plans further tests in cancer cell cultures and in animals over the next year to see if the gene could be effectively reinserted into human tumors to slow the cancer's growth.</p>
<p>The gene was linked to certain kinds of brain tumors, including neuroblastoma, a rare form of childhood tumor, and glioblastoma multiforme tumors, which account for 30 percent of all primary brain tumors among adults. The gene was also found to suppress renal cell cancer, which is the most common form of kidney cancer in adults.</p>
