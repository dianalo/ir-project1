<p>Pakistani gold rates slumped to a year-low on Saturday amid depressed local demand for the precious metal and the decline in world prices, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said 10 gram gold rates sank to a year-low of 4,398 rupees from 4,415 on Friday.</p>
<p>"The sharp fall in international gold rates is one reason for the declining rates here," gold dealer Farooq Querashi said.</p>
<p>"But the major factor that dragged down local gold prices is the country's economic problems...people now simply don't have money to buy gold," he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said not only investors were unloading their long positions, but ordinary citizens were also selling gold jewellery.</p>
