<p>The opposition Labour Party has accused European Commission President Jacques Santer of making an ill-judged intervention in Britain's election campaign with his spirited attack on Eurosceptic "doom merchants."</p>
<p>But his blunt message proved an electoral godsend for Prime Minister John Major, whose party has been shaken by divisions over Europe and grown fearful of intervention by Brussels and erosion of national sovereignty.</p>
<p>In a speech in Amsterdam on Monday, Santer railed against what he called "unjustified and misplaced" outbursts of Euroscepticism.</p>
<p>"Do these doom merchants want us to step backwards towards a Europe only composed of simple trading arrangements?" he asked.</p>
<p>The speech provoked a frosty response from Labour's Home Afffairs spokesman Jack Straw who told BBC Television: "I think it was ill-judged and unwise of him to make this intervention.</p>
<p>"It's been an understanding that members of the European Commission do not interfere in the politics of the nation states, particularly at the time of an election," he said.</p>
<p>The Sun, Britain's best-selling tabloid which has switched its allegiance to Labour, said of Santer: "He clearly thinks he is President of Europe. Well he isn't. He's just a jumped-up pipsqueak of a civil servant."</p>
<p>But Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, who has moved toward the Eurosceptic wing of the ruling Conservative Party, was delighted by the speech: "I positively welcome it," he said.</p>
<p>Both Major and Labour leader Tony Blair have adopted a "wait and see" stance on whether Britain should join a Single European Currency, due to be launched in January 1999.</p>
<p>This contrasts sharply with France where President Jacques Chirac on Monday called a snap parliamentary election aimed at revitalising the country before it joins the currency.</p>
<p>Chirac said a single EU currency was "essential if we want to assert ourselves as a great economic and political power" with the euro on an equal footing with the dollar and the yen.</p>
<p>Major, trailing Blair by up to 20 percentage points in opinion polls for the May 1 election, passionately believes he can convince voters he is the right man to fight Britain's corner in Europe.</p>
<p>But many Conservative candidates, bidding to give the party an unprecedented fifth election win in a row, have said in their constituency election addresses that they would never vote to jettison the pound sterling.</p>
<p>Major says Blair has given away his negotiating position in advance of the June European summit in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>"If it is right for Britain, I will keep my feet on the brakes. Mr Blair would go to Amsterdam and put his foot on the accelerator to a federal Europe," Major claimed on Monday.</p>
<p>Blair insisted in his one big foreign policy speech of the six-week campaign that he was the true British patriot.</p>
<p>"If there is a desire for a superstate, we will stop it. We want a Europe where national identities are not submerged," he said.</p>
