<p>Belmont Homes Inc said President and Chief Executive Officer Jerold Kennedy was recently diagnosed with a small cancerous lung tumor, but the prognosis for remission was excellent.</p>
<p>Physicians said the growth was detected at an early stage and there was no indication it had spread, Belmont said.</p>
<p>Management said there would be little change in Kennedy's day-to-day involvement at the office.</p>
<p>Prognosis for complete remission of the cancer was excellent, the company said, adding Kennedy was expected to miss little time from the office during his chemotherapy.</p>
