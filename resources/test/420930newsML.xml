<p>Officials at Bank of Boston Corp's Brazil unit will put on a roadshow on March 13 in Boston seeking to attract U.S. clients to the selloff of power generating plant Cachoeira Dourada, scheduled for mid-May, the bank said in a statement.</p>
<p>The 658-megawatt hydroelectrical plant, located in the central state of Goias, will be the first Brazilian generator to be privatized, the statement said.</p>
<p>Banco de Boston said the roadshow is part of an agreement signed between the bank and Goias state government last October under which the bank committed itself to help the state with the privatization of its companies.</p>
<p>"Our objective is to help the state to promote the privatization, but we will be working as advisors of potential buyers," said Sergio Duque Estrada, director at Banco de Boston, who is coordinating the roadshow.</p>
<p>Estrada said Goias state government is likely to present to investors on the roadshow a draft of the tender documents for Cachoeira Dourada's selloff.</p>
