<p>Finnish food, animal feed and chemicals group Raision Tehtaat Oy said on Monday talks with potential partners for production of its cholesterol-reducing Benecol margarine were still going on and no decisions would be made in January.</p>
<p>"It will be later," Raisio spokesman Jarkko Heino told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>He was asked to comment on an article in International Herald Tribune last Thursday quoting an Raisio executive as saying Raisio would choose its international partner in January.</p>
<p>"Negotiations are going and we have several options," Heino said, but declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>Raisio shares rose last week and continued to rise sharply on Monday as the article boosted overseas demand, brokers said.</p>
<p>At 1525/1325 GMT, Raisio traded at 345.00 markka, up 28.00 markka or almost nine percent, after hitting a life-high 350.00 markka.</p>
