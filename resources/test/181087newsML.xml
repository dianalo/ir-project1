<p>Thai stocks finished sharply lower in thin trade on Monday as investors took profits on gains of large capitalised stocks last week, said traders.</p>
<p>The SET Index closed at 947.28, down 20.32 points or 2.10 percent, on 2.48 billion baht turnover. The SET-50 ended down 1.91 points at 72.21.</p>
<p>"It's very difficult to interest anyone this week ahead of the election," said a foreign broker at Krungthai Thanakit.  </p>
<p>He said the uncertain outcome of the November 17 election increased the risk of pre-poll speculation.</p>
<p>"It's a straight forward punt on the election but it is difficult to find a reason to go in this week. If the Democrats win, you'd probably have missed the bottom and if the NAP (New Aspiration Party) comes in, the market could test previous lows so why don't we wait for that," he said.</p>
