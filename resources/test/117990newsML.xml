<p>Value-At-Risk (VAR) models as a tool to manage market risk are used by only a handful of banks in London, an official with the British Bankers' Association (BBA) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Only around 26 out of the 400 to 500 banks authorised to take deposits by the Bank of England are currently using internal risk models allowed under the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD), said Peter Vipond, assistant director at the BBA. He was at a conference here on internal risk models.</p>
<p>CAD was brought in by the European Union in 1993 to outline rules for measuring and managing market risk.</p>
<p>VAR models measure the potential loss in the market value of a financial institution's portfolio using mathematical equations that measure such variables as volatility.</p>
<p>"For most banks, most risk is credit risk rather than market risk," he said.</p>
<p>Whether banks use VAR depends to a large extent on the type of business they are involved in, their size, their information technology capabilities and their appetitie for risk, he said.</p>
<p>"IT (information technology) constraints are probably the biggest constraint to modelling," he said.</p>
