<p>U.S. Robotics Corp jumped to its highest level in more than a month Thursday as expectations grew that the company would have a faster modem on the market by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The Skokie, Illinois-based modem maker will not comment on whether it is close to shipping a 56 kilobits bits per second modem. But though Rockwell International Corp's semiconductor unit said earlier this week it expects to demonstrate 56 kilobit transmission capabilities at a trade show in November, analysts think U.S. Robotics, with a dominant modem market position, will still be quicker to ship a faster modem.</p>
<p>"My sense is (U.S. Robotics) probably (will ship by) the end of this year, but I think the others will take a little longer," said Amar Senan, analyst at Volpe, Welty.</p>
<p>John Grangaard, analyst at GS2 Securities, said this could give U.S. Robotics months of lead time on its competition.</p>
<p>"I'm expecting U.S. Robotics to have a product in the fourth calendar quarter," he said. "They could have anything from a six to 12 months lead time on the competition."</p>
<p>U.S. Robotics was up 4-5/8 to 61-3/8 Thursday with 6.3 million shares traded.</p>
