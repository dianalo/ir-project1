<p>Susan McDougal, a former business partner of President Clinton, was moved Thursday from an Arkansas jail to a federal prison at Fort Worth, Texas.</p>
<p>McDougal has been behind bars since Sept. 9 for refusing to answer a grand jury's questions about Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater real estate investment. She was convicted in May of fraud in the first jury trial of the Whitewater investigation and sentenced to two years in prison. She has yet to begin serving that sentence.</p>
<p>An official of the Arkansas jail where McDougal has been held was relieved that she was being transferred.</p>
<p>"Life is about to return to normal," said Sheriff Bob Blankenship of Conway, Ark., who requested McDougal's transfer.</p>
<p>Blankenship's jail, about 30 miles north of Little Rock, has a contract to house federal prisoners. But he said McDougal's heavy schedule of press and television interviews jeopardised security at the jail and required additional personnel at overtime pay rates.</p>
<p>"I'm looking forward to resuming the slow pace of a country sheriff," Blankenship said.</p>
<p>McDougal and her former husband, James McDougal, were partners with President and Mrs. Clinton in an Arkansas real estate project in the 1970s called Whitewater.</p>
<p>A prosecution witness at the McDougals' trial testified that Clinton had pressured him to make an illegal loan to Susan McDougal, a portion of which was diverted to the Whitewater account.</p>
<p>Clinton denied the accusation. So did James McDougal, although he is cooperating with special prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr's probe of the Clintons' financial affairs.</p>
<p>A federal judge ordered Susan McDougal jailed when she refused to cooperate with Starr and answer questions about Clinton before a special grand jury empaneled to assist Starr.</p>
<p>U.S. Marshal Conrad Patillo of Little Rock confirmed that McDougal was moved to Carswell Federal Medical Centre at Fort Worth. "She is now in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons," Patillo said.</p>
