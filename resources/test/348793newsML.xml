<p>Interbank rates were higher in moderate trading on Friday on the back of the U.S. dollar's continued strength against the Hong Kong dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>Overnight cash rose to 5-3/4 9/16 percent from 5-1/2 7/16 and three-month money was 5-9/16 1/2 percent 5-7/16 3/8.</p>
<p>Activity was focused on short-dates since term money was already too expensive to borrow, one dealer said.</p>
<p>"Bank demand for U.S. dollars in order to issue Hong Kong dollar notes in addition to a recent big (interest) arbitrage order boosted the U.S. dollar," a European bank dealer said.  </p>
<p>Hong Kong's note issuing banks must have U.S. dollars on hand before issuing the equivalent local currency. Demand for the local unit has also been strong ahead of Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong dollar stood at HK$7.7490/00 to US$1.00 after hitting a high of HK$7.7497, nearing levels last seen following the Mexican crisis of December 1994.</p>
<p>The U.S./Hong Kong dollar rate should continue to stay at the current high level in the next week or two and local money rates were likely to be steady to firmer before Chinese New Year in early February, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Government papar yields did not follow overnight U.S. treasuries and were generally firmer at midday with buying interest on short-dated bills.</p>
<p>Yields of one-week Exchange Fund bills jumped in line with money rates to 5.00 percent versus 4.43 percent.</p>
<p>The three-year note yield edged up slightly to 6.13 from 6.11, the five-year was 6.62 versus 6.60 percent and the seven-year added two basis points to 6.84 percent.</p>
<p>The longest 10-year note yield was 7.06 versus 7.05 percent.</p>
