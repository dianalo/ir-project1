<p>Hungary is interested in Malaysia's privatisation programme and wants to enhance economic ties, Malaysia's defence minister said on Monday.</p>
<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn expressed interest in the privatisation programme during a meeting with his Malaysian counterpart Mahathir Mohamad, Defence Minister and acting Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar told reporters afterward.</p>
<p>Malaysia has listed a number of state companies on the local stock exchange and awarded other state entities to well-capitalised businessmen.</p>
<p>"Hungary would also like to see more participation from Malaysian investors in its economy which is undergoing a transition period from a state-run to an open market economy," the national news agency Bernama quoted Syed Hamid as saying.</p>
<p>Horn arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Monday for a two-day official visit.</p>
<p>Syed Hamid said Hungary offered expertise in tourism development to Malaysia and wanted to learn of Malaysia's experience in developing technology parks.</p>
<p>Horn invited Malaysian investors to come to Hungary. Malaysia currently has only one bank and one electronics company operating in the central European country.</p>
<p>Malaysia-Hungary trade totalled US$62.8 million in 1996, up 76 percent from US$46.5 million in 1995, a Hungarian official accompanying Horn said.</p>
