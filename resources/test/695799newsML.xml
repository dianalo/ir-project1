<p>Latvian shares were mixed in slow trade on Monday and dealers said they hoped that six-month company results, due in July, would inject life into the sluggish market.</p>
<p>Total turnover came to 61,000 lats compared to Friday's 83,000. The bourse index closed 0.41 points or 0.11 percent up at 383.62.</p>
<p>The Rietumu index slipped 0.59 percent to 152.63.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the market to respond favourably to a spate of company results due out soon.</p>
<p>"Six-month results will be released in July and for many bigger stocks expectations are pretty upbeat," Karlis Krastinsh, head of the securities department with Saules Bank, told Reuters.</p>
<p>On the official list, Staburadze confectionery rose one santime to 2.72 lats as it saw volume of 3,800 lats. Unibanka added three santimes to 3.38 lats in trade of 20,700 lats.</p>
<p>Riga Shipyard and the Riga Transport Fleet lost ground. Shipyard registered trade of 9,000 lats as it lost two santimes to 1.30 lats.</p>
<p>Fleet closed two santimes lower at 1.15 lats on volume of 3,600 lats.</p>
<p>Olainfarm, a  pharmaceutical company on the secondary list, plummeted to 2.17 lats from 2.55 lats, turning over 4,800 lats.</p>
<p>The company, which made its bourse debut a few weeks ago, has bounced up and down and dealers remain divided over its value.</p>
