<p>Shares of French insurer Axa , which merged recently with rival UAP , hit an historic high on the Paris bourse on Tuesday, driven by speculation the group would streamline its holdings by selling one of its British units.</p>
<p>The shares closed up 1.35 percent at 383.10 francs ($67.79) in volume of 1.32 million shares after reaching an all-time high of 383.40 francs earlier in the session.</p>
<p>Also supporting the share on Tuesday was a statement by the group that it felt "extremely at ease" with analysts' forecasts that the group would post a profit of between 3.6 billion francs and 3.9 billion francs, up from 2.73 billion francs in 1995.</p>
<p>An Axa spokesman declined on Tuesday to comment on the speculation that surfaced after a British newspaper, The Times, reported on Monday that Axa would sell Equity and Law in an auction that could raise up to one billion pounds, double the 467 million pound price paid by Axa in 1987.</p>
<p>But since the announcement of the merger of Axa and UAP, Axa executives have been reviewing the future of all the group's units and industrial stakes with the aim of rationalising international activities, a source close to the company said.</p>
<p>"We are exploring many options," he said.</p>
<p>One French portfolio manager said he believed Axa was in the process of finalising plans for the sale of Equity and Law. "I have been talking to managers at British banks. For them, Axa is in the process of selling Equity and Law," he said.</p>
<p>In Britain, Axa also owns non-life insurer Axa Insurance and Axa Global Risks which covers maritime, aviation and transport risks. For its part, UAP holds Sun Life, the fourth largest British life insurer and Provincial, the 13th largest non-life insurer.</p>
<p>Axa and UAP will report their results on March 26.</p>
<p>Axa is in the process of completing its merger with UAP after the deal announced in November but consolidated Axa-UAP accounts will only be published for the 1997 financial years onwards. ($ = 5.651 French Francs)</p>
