<p>OTE telecom said in a statement on Thursday it expected 1996 turnover to rise 16.3 percent to 690 billion drachmas from 593 billion in 1995 and to reach 797 billion, up 15.5 percent, in 1997.</p>
<p>Pretax profits are expected up 22.7 percent in 1996 at 250 billion drachmas versus 203 billion in 1995. In 1997 profits are forecast at 304 billion drachmas, up 21.7 percent, it said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, OTE officials told a news conference on Thursday that the results of an international tender for a 100 billion drachma mobile telephony project, would be finalised in March.</p>
<p>"The offers must be submitted by February 28 and our decision will be announced in March," said Dimitris Papoulias, OTE's president.  </p>
<p>The three candidates are American Air Touch, Norwegian Telenor and English Orange, all with extensive know-how in the telecommunications sector worldwide, he added.</p>
<p>Two international advisors, MSI and Ernst &amp; Young have being chosen to set the technical standards and prepare the bidding documents respectively, said Christos Kazantzis, the company's financial manager.</p>
<p>"The investment will total up to 100 billion drachmas. Half of this amount, 50 billion, have already been submitted from OTE's own equity. The remaining 50 billion will be borrowed after 1998," he added.</p>
<p>He added that a new company, COSMOTE, was created during the last meeting of OTE's board of directors, solely for the purpose of handling mobile telecommunications.</p>
<p>"The foreign company which will be selected as OTE's partner in March will have a 30 percent stake in COSMOTE," said Papoulias.</p>
<p>OTE plans to expand to all Balkan countries by buying out shares in local national phone companies, he added.</p>
<p>He said that OTE was currently in talks with the national economy ministry to decide how to proceed with another flotation.</p>
<p>It will be the second flotation after the state sold eight percent of OTE's shares in 1996.</p>
<p>The national economy minister will announce exactly how this flotation will take place in the beginning of March, he added. --Margarita Sotiropoulou, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
