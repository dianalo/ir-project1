<p>Taiwan share prices are expected to consolidate on Monday as investors remain on the sidelines amid political uncertainties, brokers said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the weighted index closed 40.82 points or 0.50 percent higher to 8,274.19 points.</p>
<p>Recent political uncertainties, including a planned cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday and the opposition parties' plan to demand that President Lee Teng-hui name a new premier, would dominate market sentiment, brokers said.  </p>
<p>"Domestic political situation is quite uncertain at the moment, so is the stock market," said Amy Huang, an analyst of Nomura Securities.</p>
<p>But brokers said they did not expect a sharp fall as government-related funds would likely to buy stocks at low levels.</p>
<p>A range of 8,150-8,350 was seen for Monday.</p>
