<headline>Brazil panel approves FEF fund extension bill.</headline>

<p>A bill extending Brazil's Fiscal Stabilization Fund (FEF), which allows the government to sidestep constitutional spending rules, was approved in its first committee-level vote in Congress Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Constitution and Justice Committee of the Chamber of Deputies approved the bill which now advances to a special committee in the lower house.</p>
<p>The government wants to extend the FEF for two-and-a-half years after June 30 when an existing version of the fund is due to expire.</p>
<p>The FEF allows the Treasury to hold on to about $10 billion annually from funds it is constitutionally obliged to pass on to states and municipalities.</p>
<p>The government says it uses the FEF for social spending, avoiding the need for budget cuts or extra borrowing.  Critics from opposition and government-allied parties say it gives too much power to the president and his ministers.</p>
<p>As a constitutional amendment, the bill requires two three-fifths majorities in each house of Congress. (( -- William Schomberg, Brasilia newsroom 5561 2230358))</p>
