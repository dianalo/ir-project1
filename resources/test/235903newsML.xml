<p>The United States circulated dozens of documents to a U.N. sanctions commitee on Tuesday to prove contraband Iraqi oil was being transported through Iranian waters in violation of U.N. sanctions.</p>
<p>The committee chairman, ambassador Tono Eitel of Germany, told reporters after the closed-door session that Iran had sent a letter saying it was aware of the traffic and that it had itself seized between five and nine offending vessels a year, including one only a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Deputy United States U.S. representative Edward Gnehm, in a note to the committee enclosing the documents, said they related to vessels intercepted and diverted by ships of the U.S.-led Multinational Interception Force (MIF), operating under the authority of a 1990 Security Council resolution.</p>
<p>Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions, including a ban on oil sales, since its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>Gnehm said the documents "demonstrate that each vessel loaded Iraqi petroleum products in an Iraqi port and either used Iranian territorial waters or presented forged/falsified Iranian documents in attempting to avoid diversion by the MIF."</p>
<p>The documents ranged from interception reports detailing the movements of suspected vessels in and out of Iranian waters, to letters and statements by crew members referring to trips to Iraq.</p>
<p>Also included were laboratory reports by the U.S. Customs Service saying samples they tested were "derived from Basrah light crude oil from Iraq" and did not contain "any detectable distillate fuel oil material derived from Iranian light and/or Iranian heavy crude oil."</p>
<p>Referring to a briefing which U.S. State Department officials gave the Iraqi sanctions committee in August, Gnehm said: "It should be noted that, as stated in the briefing, the cases of these vessels are representative of a pattern of such activity, which continues to be a source of significant violations of the relevant Security Council resolutions."</p>
<p>Eitel said the sanctions committee, which has the same composition as the 15-nation Security Council, decided to send Iran a letter encouraging it to continue its monitoring and to try to prevent the trafficking. No one on the committee had accused the Iranian government of colluding in the illegal activities, he added.</p>
