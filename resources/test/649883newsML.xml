<p>A move by South Korea's Samsung Motors Inc to begin a debate about restructuring the nation's struggling car industry has backfired at a critical juncture for the upstart auto manufacturer, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Rumoured to be short on cash and hobbled by a need for technology, Samsung has become increasingly desperate to buy its way into the industry, they said.</p>
<p>"There must be a sense of urgency on the part of Samsung in light of global excess supply issues and the need for restructuring," said Kang Hoon-suk, an analyst at ING Barings.</p>
<p>"The car unit is emerging as a big headache to the whole Samsung Group," said Lee Hahn-koo, president of Daewoo Research Institute. "When it planned to enter the market, conditions looked much better. Now the story is quite different."</p>
<p>Analysts said Samsung was casting about for a solution when it proposed in an internal report, which is widely believed to have been intentionally leaked to the press, to restructure the crowded domestic auto industry to avert a possible crisis.</p>
<p>An industry shake-out would benefit a company with Samsung's deep pockets. But the report set off a firestorm of criticism.</p>
<p>Kia Motors Corp, the country's second-largest carmaker and most attractive takeover target, threatened to sue Samsung.</p>
<p>And on Monday, Samsung bowed to strong criticism from its competitors and said it was not interested in any merger and acquisition deals.</p>
<p>Analysts said that while the leaked report probably turned public opinion against a Kia takeover, such a move nonetheless remained Samsung's best alternative.</p>
<p>"Samsung has no other choice but to buy an existing manufacturer in order to survive and grow as a major player," said Ji Sung-chul, an analyst at LG Economic Research Institute.</p>
<p>"The deal, if realised, would give Samsung all it needed -- capacity, technology and, more importantly, a network of part suppliers," said Kang of ING Barings.</p>
<p>Analysts said Samsung was at a critical juncture and must decide whether to go ahead with its original plan to turn out 500,000 cars a year by 2002 or to seek a takeover.</p>
<p>"Further investment in car production will worsen the group's financial status, given the current slump in the car market and the glut in capacity," Lee of Daewoo said.</p>
<p>Oh Kyu-chang, a fellow at the Korea Institute for International Economics and Trade, said Samsung was probably having trouble getting its foreign partner, Nissan Motor Co, to cooperate on transferring technology.</p>
<p>Nissan, which has benefited from the yen's fall against the dollar in recent years, is now much healthier financially than when it signed a technology contract with Samsung in 1994.</p>
<p>"If Nissan loses interest in helping Samsung, what other Japanese companies would be willing to help Samsung which would become their rival at some point?," Oh of the KIET said.</p>
<p>"Nissan at first said Samsung could export. But the Japanese maker will try to limit that benefit and others as long as Samsung copies Nissan's models," said Hur Kang, an analyst at Hyundai Securities.</p>
<p>Samsung Motor spokesman Han Jae-yoon said the company had experienced no problems financing its planned projects and cooperating with Nissan. A Nissan spokesman contacted in Tokyo refused to discuss Samsung.</p>
