<p>The European Commission said on Friday it had approved a plan by U.S.-based General Electric Capital Services and BankAmerica International Investment to take joint control of Spanish cable TV operator Cableuropa SA.</p>
<p>Cableuropa announced in May that the two companies had taken a 32.5 percent stake in it through their joint venture Spain Telecommunications Ltd (Spainco).</p>
<p>"Cableuropa will be confronted with active competition from other companies that are firmly established in the markets in question, notably Telefonica in telecommunications and Sogecable in the pay TV market," the Commission said in a statement.</p>
