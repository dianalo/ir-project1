<p>The Italians, who have long regarded the UEFA Cup as their property, had a disastrous campaign last season and are looking to the awe-inspiring lineup of Internazionale, Parma, Roma and Lazio to reestablish their authority.</p>
<p>Clubs from arguably the strongest league in the world won the UEFA Cup six times in the eight years until this year when none managed to reach the semifinals.</p>
<p>But the draw for the 1996/97 competition proper, which starts on Tuesday was not entirely welcomed in Italy with two sides coming up against French clubs, who have a growing reputation as Italian killers.</p>
<p>Internazionale, who now have two French players in defender Jocelyn Angloma and new signing Youri Djorkaeff, will travel to little Guingamp for their first match, while Lazio visit northern Lens, currently second in the French league.</p>
<p>"Internazionale are a club with strong individuals but all the pressure will be on them," said Guingamp trainer Francis Smerecki, whose team qualified through the Intertoto Cup.</p>
<p>Roma face a difficult task at home to Dynamo Moscow but they will go into the game on a high following their 3-1 win against Piacenza on Saturday.</p>
<p>Parma, 3-0 winners against Napoli in their last league match, will be without injured Argentine striker Herman Crespo when they entertain Portuguese side Vitoria Giumaraes.</p>
<p>Holders Bayern Munich may find their first test against Spanish team Valencia less worrying than they expected after Brazilian World Cup striker Romario was left out of the squad on Monday.</p>
<p>An angry Romario, who said he had been criticised during training, suggested he could not work with coach Luis Aragones and might leave the club he has just joined, but later withdrew the threat.</p>
<p>Romario arrived at Valencia from Flamengo unexpectedly during the close season to fill the gap left by the transfer of top-scorer Predrag Mijatovic to Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Other newcomers included Argentine international striker Claudio Lopez and Russian midfielder Valery Karpin as Valencia put together a side that looked capable of going one better than last year's second place in the Spanish league.</p>
<p>But since then everything has gone wrong. Chairman Paco Roig has clashed with manager Luis Aragones, and Valencia threw away a two goal lead to go down 3-2 at Racing Santander before losing their first home match with unfancied Real Sociedad 1-0.</p>
<p>The draw was particularly tough on other German clubs as Borussia Moenchengladbach and Hamburg will face Arsenal and Glasgow Celtic Glasgow respectively. Arsenal, still without a manager, look likely to keep England goalkeeper David Seaman on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Seaman has an injured hamstring and has missed Arsenal's last two outings.</p>
<p>The final German team involved, Schalke 04, are at home to Dutch side Roda JC Kerkrade, who have made a slow start to the season following the loss of several key players during the summer break.</p>
<p>Newcastle, boasting their record 15 million pounds sterling ($23.4 million) England striker Alan Shearer, look forward to a fresh start on the European stage.</p>
<p>They seem to have little to fear from modest Swedish side Halmstad, who go to St James Park following a 3-1 home defeat to Orgryte in their national league.</p>
<p>Slavia Prague head into their match against Swedish side Malmo still looking for the form which carried them to a surprise semifinal appearance in last season's UEFA Cup.</p>
<p>With summer signings taking away the likes of Karel Poborsky (Manchester United), Vladimir Smicer (Racing Lens) and Radek Bejbl (Atletico Madrid), Slavia have paid the price of success.</p>
<p>Feyenoord Rotterdam have a fully fit squad for Tuesday's visit to CSKA Moscow and will be buoyed by Saturday's 4-1 drubbing of Willem II which keeps the Rotterdam side in second spot in the league two points behind PSV.</p>
<p>France, who have no fewer than five clubs in this season's UEFA Cup, will rely chiefly on star-studded Monaco, who host Polish side Hutnik Cracaw on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Montpellier will be at home to former Cup Winners' Cup holders Sporting Lisbonl while Metz will travel to Austrian side FC Tirol Innsbruck, second in the Austrian league standings.</p>
