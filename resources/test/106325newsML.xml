<p>Danish share prices closed at another record closing level on Wednesday for the eighth successive trading day with dealers expecting imminent consolidation before further gains.</p>
<p>"Danish shares have been outdoing foreign markets but a period of retrenchment is needed and expected before we can expect to see gains resuming," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index closed 0.24 point up at 126.49 in overall bourse turnover of 1.085 billion crowns. The KFX December future remained untraded at 125.75.</p>
<p>Banks were very much in focus, with BG Bank rising a solid 15 crowns to close at 243, its new 3.4 million crown equity issue oversubscribed.</p>
<p>Unibank put on three crowns to finish at 287, while rival Den Danske Bank shed five crowns to end at 429.</p>
<p>SAS Denmark attracted a lot of attention too, closing half a crown higher at 70.50 in 420,000 share turnover.</p>
