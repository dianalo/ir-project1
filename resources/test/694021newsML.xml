<headline>KL interbank rates remain weak, market still flush.</headline>

<p>Interbank rates continued to fall on Friday as the market remained flush, dealers said.</p>
<p>But rumours of a new bond issue prevented a further drop in rates, they said.</p>
<p>"There's a strong rumour of a new bond issue. This is highly possible given the flush market situation now," said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>Rumours of a new bond issue first surfaced a few months ago following maturity of a series of bond issues which were not rolled over. Bank Negara last issued long-term government bonds in November 1996.</p>
<p>Dealers said rates were also softer after a widely expected Bank Negara lending maturity on Thursday, said to be for two billion ringgit, failed to materialise.</p>
<p>Such a maturity should tighten liquidity and push rates higher, they said.</p>
<p>One-month money was at 7.30/35 percent after earlier trading at 7.25, against 7.35/40 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>One-week money was at 6.50 percent from 6.60/70, and three-month at 7.40/45 percent against 7.50.</p>
<p>Dealers expect the overnight rate to remain at 5.80 percent as many local and foreign banks were highly liquid.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were mixed.</p>
<p>At 0400 GMT, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was up one point to 92.68, or an implied yield of 7.32 percent.</p>
<p>The December contract also rose one to 92.78, or 7.22 percent while March 1998 was down two to 92.81, or 7.19 percent.</p>
