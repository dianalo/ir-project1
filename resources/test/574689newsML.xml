<p>India needs to act quickly to ensure that large subsidies on oil were cut back and the government was considering a mix of options to tackle the issue, finance minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said on Sunday.</p>
<p>"The Prime Minister has started a debate by indicating that the question cannot be ducked for too long. Some arrangement has to be made, some decision has to be taken," Chidambaram told Reuters Financial Television in this southern Japanese city where is attending the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank.</p>
<p>Cutting the subsidies would mean raising domestic fuel prices and that is a politically sensitive issue.</p>
<p>"I think the petroleum minister is considering a mix of options," Chidambaram said.</p>
<p>The options would be to raise domestic product prices along with cutting import duties on crude oil and petroleum products.</p>
<p>But there again it is a tough choice.</p>
<p>"It is difficult to lower import duties right now because the budget assumed a certain amount of revenue. Now if there are compensatroy duties elsewhere, then one can think of lowering duties ... I think we should go for a mix of options," Chidambaram said..</p>
