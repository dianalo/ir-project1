<p>Belgrade authorities broke the back of a public transport strike on Tuesday, sending in police to disperse protesters blocking buses and arresting a trade union leader, organisers said.</p>
<p>"Special police forces stormed into the bus garage in Novi Beograd, beat up some of the workers and arrested the president of the drivers' trade union," Dragan Milovanovic, head of the independent metal workers' trade union, told a news conference.</p>
<p>"Police units were sent to all other garages in the morning to disperse protesters and force them to work."</p>
<p>The police action succeeded clearing striking drivers from bus garages which they blockaded.</p>
<p>City authorities said public transport was virtually back to normal. About 880 vehicles were operating, close to the regularly-scheduled 1,020, they said.</p>
<p>Bus and tram drivers launched the strike on Monday, only days before federal and municipal elections in the Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
<p>Belgrade's Socialist mayor, Nebojsa Covic, described the strike as illegal and accused opposition parties of trying to provoke labour unrest before Sunday's polls.</p>
<p>"The strike of a part of (city transport company) workers is of a political nature and is an attempt to create chaos in the capital," Covic said.</p>
<p>Unions, opposition parties and human rights activists demanded the immediate release of Dragoljub Stosic, president of the public transport drivers' union.</p>
<p>"Our members will stage a protest in front of the city hall on Wednesday if they do not release him," Milovanovic said.</p>
<p>An attorney for the drivers' union said he had failed to find out where police were holding Stosic.</p>
<p>Opposition leaders said Stosic was arrested because he was a candidate in municipal elections and accused the authorities of punishing the unions which had come out in support of the opposition coalition.</p>
<p>"This is a reprisal by the authorities against trade unions for joining the coalition," said Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, one of five parties in the coalition.</p>
<p>It was unclear if city authorities had agreed to union demands to pay overdue wages and holiday benefits. The pro-government daily Politika quoted Covic as saying the drivers' demands had been met but gave no details.</p>
<p>A wave of strikes or threatened strikes to protest against high taxes and unpaid wages has hit the country over the past month.</p>
<p>The government, confronted with a cash-starved economy, has set high tax rates and delayed payment of wages and pensions over the past year to try to raise revenues.</p>
