<p>Prospects of lower inflation and interest rates will help to power Italian BTPs to tighter yield spreads against Bunds so long as optimism surrounds the cause of European Economic and Monetary Union, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The spread of 10-year BTPs against Bunds shrank to 285 basis points on Friday from 294 at Thursday's close, supported by a strong lira and expectations of favourable consumer price data from most major Italian cities early next week.</p>
<p>"After the 1997 budget and with lower inflation, it is very possible Italy will go closer to 200 than 225 (by year-end)," said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell fixed income strategist Andrea Delitala.</p>
<p>This would intensify pressure on the Bank of Italy to cut interest rates soon for the first time since the discount rate came down to 8.25 percent from nine percent on July 23.</p>
<p>"With good September inflation figures, we may well see the Bank of Italy cut rates as early as the end of this month," said Craig Shute, fixed income analyst at Bear Stearns.</p>
<p>Other analysts thought the Bank would delay a while longer, despite this week's appeal by Prime Minister Romano Prodi who said everything was at stake for the economy in the next few months and that a fast rate cut was its "only hope".</p>
<p>The BTP/Bund spread was above 500 basis points in December 1995, and reached its lowest level this year in the 270s early in July.</p>
<p>"Once the budget is presented and people feel confident it will be passed, I think the spread could come down even further maybe even to 200", said a futures broker in London.</p>
<p>Delitala agreed the spread could narrow towards 200 by the end of this year, but this was conditional on the European Union continuing to reinforce the drive towards EMU, about which optimistic scenarios were increasingly built into the market.</p>
<p>"Markets are banking on a political conclusion to EMU that will involve loose interpretation of the (Maastricht treaty economic convergence) criteria," Delitala said.</p>
<p>Delitala said the more heavily the market banked on EMU happening, the more vulnerable it would be to reverses if there were swings in sentiment on the subject.</p>
<p>He said there were likely to be setbacks in BTP yield spreads versus Bunds in the months ahead, possibly of the order of 10 to 20 basis points, but that he would view any such retreat as a buying opportunity.</p>
<p>Shute said Prodi's comments highlighted concern that Italy's real economy was in difficulty.</p>
<p>"We know Italian growth is grinding to a halt fast so there are some good economic grounds for moving on an easing policy sooner rather than later," he said, citing a 7.4 percent fall in industrial turnover in the year to June.</p>
<p>"If the Bank of Italy drag their feet, the short end of the market will get hurt the most," said Shute, adding that the yield curve would flatten in such a scenario.</p>
<p>The futures broker said he expected a rate cut of half or three-quarters of a percentage point but probably not until December.</p>
<p>He said the market was discounting good news on September inflation with an annual rate of 3.3 to 3.4 percent.</p>
<p>"If it is much less than this, around three percent, BTPs will charge up even more," he said.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the broker said prices might correct a little, especially if they had managed to break through their all-time high of 119.15 to around 120.00 before the data came out.</p>
<p>December BTPs were trading at 118.75 at 1343 GMT, 63 basis points up on the day. Earlier, they pushed up to 119.10 before falling back.</p>
