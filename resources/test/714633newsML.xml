<headline>GEC drops on shake-up plan, in-line profit.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-08</dateline>

<p>Shares in General Electric Co Plc fell slightly after initial disappointment with the company's shake-up plan and in-line profits sparked a round of profit taking, traders said.</p>
<p>By 0811 GMT, GEC shares were off 6-1/2p at 371p after edging up to 385p immediately after the headlines came out.  </p>
<p>"The order books are a little disappointing," one market maker said. "The market was half hoping for some concrete news and concrete evidence but there were no real results. It has had a good run-up and the news was a little disappointing."</p>
<p>"It's a lack of tangible news," he said.</p>
<p>But some traders said the fall in shares may be temporary.</p>
<p>One trader pointed to GEC's pledge to remit any surplus cash to shareholders.</p>
<p>The company said the investment needed to fulfil its growth strategy would be financed out of GEC's cash resources.</p>
<p>GEC shares jumped nearly 10 percent last week as a storm of speculation billowed ahead of its strategic review, with rumours ranging from major sell-offs to full-blown take-over bids.</p>
<p>The electronics giant said on Tuesday it was moving away from a joint venture culture towards a GEC-managed group focused on defence and aerospace, industrial electronics and communications.</p>
<p>It also said it was in active talks with Alcatel Alsthom Cie Generale d'Electricite' to determine the future of GEC Alsthom, the two companies' rail and power joint venture.</p>
<p>GEC also unveiled annual profits before tax and exceptional charges of 1.01 billion stg, compared with 1.00 billion stg previously. Analysts were expecting profits to come in around 1.04 billion stg.</p>
<p>The review comes against a backdrop of mounting pressure for the European defence industry to consolidate after mega-mergers in the U.S. between Lockheed Martin Corp and Northrop Grumman Corp, plus Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas Corp.</p>
