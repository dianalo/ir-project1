<p>Geula Amir, whose son Yigal assassinated Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, protested on Thursday outside the U.S. embassy in Israel, complaining she was not getting a visa to enter the United States.</p>
<p>"I want to protest. I'm not getting a visa," she told Israel's army radio outside the embassy in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>"There is no reason for me not to get a visa. I don't have a criminal record."</p>
<p>The embassy, asked to respond to Amir's statement, said it could not comment on the status of visa requests.</p>
<p>But a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity said her request was still pending.</p>
<p>Yigal Amir is serving a life sentence for the 1995 assassination and his brother Hagai is serving 12 years for being an accomplice.</p>
<p>The radio said Geula Amir had a speaking tour arranged in the United States.</p>
<p>She said: "There are television crews waiting for us there and we want to work for Hagai and (improving) his conditions."</p>
<p>Asked by Israel's Channel Two Television why she was not also campaigning for Yigal, the mother said cryptically: "Yigal has his own story. In six months he'll raise the issues."</p>
