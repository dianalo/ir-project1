<p>French authorities urged holiday-makers on Sunday to delay their journey home after cold weather closed several motorways in the southwest and virtually sealed off a few Pyrenees ski resorts.</p>
<p>The national road traffic centre recommended caution for those forced to tackle the difficult trip home from the Bordeaux region in the southwest or from central France, both badly hit by snow and ice.</p>
<p>Several hundred travellers spent Saturday night in schools and municipal halls after the A20 motorway in the Limousin region was closed. Traffic restarted at dawn but only on one lane.</p>
<p>Other drivers were stranded in the Charente and Charente-Maritime regions, and in the Gers department schoolchildren were given an extra day's holiday and some 7,000 households had no electricity supply.</p>
<p>Further south in the Pyrenees, three ski resorts were completely sealed off by heavy snowfalls. Three other resorts organised convoys of some 100 vehicles each to allow some skiers to leave.</p>
<p>In the Rhone Valley near Lyon in central France, fresh snowfalls on Sunday seriously disrupted traffic on the A7 Autoroute du Soleil (Sun Motorway) towards Orange.</p>
<p>Traffic was also hit further east near Grenoble at the foot of the French Alps. A 17-year-old skier died in an avalanche near the village of Termignon in the Savoie region on Friday, local officials said.</p>
<p>Rail travel was also disrupted, with no high-speed TGV electric trains in the southwest. They were replaced on the Bordeaux-Paris track by slower diesel-powered locomotives.</p>
<p>SNCF railway officials said traffic between Marseille and Paris was down to one in two scheduled TGV trains. Ice had built up to 10 cm (four inches) in diameter on power lines, halting the electric trains.</p>
<p>Meteo France weather forecasters said the cold was likely to worsen on Monday and would last several days. The institute said temperatures would slip below minus 10 Celsius (14 Fahrenheit) in northern France early in the week.</p>
