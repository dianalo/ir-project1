<p>Spain's national team are to drop Seville as a permanent home for competitive games, coach Javier Clemente announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"There will be no more fixed headquarters," said Clemente, who was speaking in the Faroe Islands ahead of Wednesday's World Cup qualifier.</p>
<p>Clemente added that November's tie with Slovakia would be played in Tenerife, and that several other cities, among them Valencia, La Corunna and Alicante, were also being considered as future venues.</p>
<p>For nearly 30 years Spain played all their qualifying games in Seville, where fans became known as the "12th player" because of their vociferous support.</p>
<p>Spain have lost only once in the city -- a "dead" game to France in 1991 -- and in 1984 beat Malta 12-1 in Seville when needing a 10-goal margin to ensure a place in the European championship finals.</p>
<p>With qualification already guaranteed, Spain's last European championship group game was moved to Elche. In an earlier match, supporters angered by the exclusion of a player from local club Real Betis sang abusive songs about the manager which left Clemente close to tears.</p>
