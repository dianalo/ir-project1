<p>Pan American World Airways, a new company with a venerable name, announced a major expansion Friday, saying it would acquire Carnival Air Lines.</p>
<p>It also said it had arranged an additional $60 million in financing.</p>
<p>Pan Am Corp., which began operations last September with just two airliners, did not reveal financial terms of its agreement to acquire privately held Carnival Air, a regional airline with a fleet of 27 jet aircraft.</p>
<p>It said, however, that as part of the deal, Micky Arison, the majority owner of Carnival Air, would invest $30 million in the combined company, giving him a 42 percent stake.</p>
<p>Arison is chairman and chief executive of Carnival Corp., which operates Carnival Cruse Lines. But Carnival Air is not part of that company and is owned by Air Holding Corp.</p>
<p>Pan Am also said it had arranged a private placement of up to $30 million in a new series of convertible preferred stock.</p>
<p>Carnival Air, which was formed in 1988, has operations in South Florida, the Northeast, California and the Caribbean. It had about $270 million in revenues last year.</p>
<p>"The Carnival Air acquisition elevates Pan Am to a stronger competitive position and provides significant benefits of critical mass in an expedited, yet controlled manner," Pan Am President and Chief Executive Martin R. Shugrue Jr. said in a statement.</p>
<p>Last July Pan Am agreed to buy Carnival Air for about $100 million but called off the deal after PanAm examined the carrier's books and sought to rework the terms.</p>
<p>Pan Am currently has a fleet of four Airbus A300's -- with two more to be delivered in the next two months -- flying between New York and Los Angeles, New York and Miami, New York and San Juan, Peurto Rico, Miami and Chicago, and Miami and San Juan.</p>
<p>It plans to begin service between New York and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, on April 6.</p>
<p>The original Pan Am, one of the world's first airlines, went out of business amid a myriad of problems related to competition, its limited route structure, industry deregulation and finally, the bombing of one of its airliners over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.</p>
<p>Shugrue, who once headed the now-defunct Eastern Airlines, acquired the rights to the Pan Am name after the company went out of existence and later founded the new Pan Am, which is based in Miami.</p>
<p>Pan Am's stock fell 37.5 cents to $10.50 in early trading on the American Stock Exchange, where it was among the most-actively traded issues.</p>
