<p>Saudi Arabia has agreed to let the private sector take over operation, maintenance and management of docks and equipment used by the kingdom's ports authority, Saudi newspapers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Operations would be run on a commercial basis, they said.</p>
<p>The move, endorsed by King Fahd this week, is in line with efforts to provide more investment opportunities for the private sector in running and operating the kingdom's public establishments.</p>
<p>Saudi ports generated 558 million riyals ($147 million) in profits and handled 80 million tonnes in 1995.</p>
<p>The Saudi Ports Authority would retain its supervisory role over ports on Red Sea and Gulf coasts and to ensure there were no new price rises in handling fees, the newspapers said.</p>
<p>More Saudi nationals would be employed under government efforts to replace expatriate workers and find more jobs for Saudis.</p>
<p>The business daily al-Eqtisadiah quoted Saudi Ports Authority chief Mohammed Bakr as saying the corporation would invite the private sector to take part in six bids next week under phase one of the gradual programme.</p>
<p>They include terminals for cargo and bulk wheat imports at the eastern ports of Dammam and Jubail, roll-on roll-off (RORO) goods terminal at Jeddah and the management and operation of King Fahd ship repair complex.</p>
<p>Jeddah handles nearly one million containers a year, making it the kingdom's busiest port. It is to take delivery of 10 new cranes and two tugs to service large ships later this year as part of efforts to help improve productivity.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's 1995-2000 development plan is focusing on operating efficiency of transport service facilities after developing a modern infrastructure.</p>
