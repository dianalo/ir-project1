<p>Equity strategist Mark Tinker has quit HSBC James Capel to join rival UBS, the Swiss-owned brokerage said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a statement, UBS said Tinker would have special responsibility for UK strategy within its pan-European equity strategy group.  </p>
<p>He will succeed Tim Brown, who will assume a new role as a managing director within the UBS global equity strategy team with responsibility for creating a new research product on accountancy issues.</p>
<p>Tinker, for three years part of the equity strategy team at Capel, will report to Mark Howdle, UBS head of pan-European equity strategy.</p>
<p>Howdle said Tinker would place UK strategy in a European context in line with a reorganisation of UBS equity coverage aimed at ending the division between UK and continental European research.  </p>
<p>"We are in a process of bringing together continental and UK research into a merged pan-European structure," he said.</p>
<p>"It is driven by our clients. Virtually all our U.S. and Japanese clients look at their European investments as an indivisible entity and to have two separate product lines makes no sense."</p>
