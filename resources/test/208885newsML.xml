<p>Pete Sampras put Thursdays emotional defeat by Boris Becker to the back of his mind and knuckled down to the business of qualifying for the ATP World Championship semifinals on Friday.</p>
<p>The American world number one, whose loss to Becker was his second in a month, knocked Russias French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov out of the competition with a workmanlike 6-4 6-4 victory in 75 minutes.</p>
<p>The result set Sampras on his way to a semifinal against big-serving Croat Goran Ivanisevic on Saturday. The American has beaten Ivanisevic in two of their three clashes this year, the last in the semifinals of the U.S. Open.</p>
<p>More significantly, the victory showed why Sampras is the best player in the world.</p>
<p>Sampras admitted his 7-6 7-6 loss to Becker had been tough to swallow. The fact that the 25-year-old American could bounce back a day later and beat a player who hits the ball as hard as Kafelnikov proved his class.</p>
<p>I would have preferred a day off (after the Becker match). It was not easy. It was mentally draining, he said. But today was a new day. I woke up and tried to put what happened against Becker behind me.</p>
<p>I tossed and turned a bit (in bed last night) but eventually I fell asleep...It is not easy to come back."</p>
<p>Being successful on the busy Tour is as much about consistency as class. Sampras sets himself apart from the rest because he has the ability to lift himself out of trouble when not feeling or playing at his best.</p>
<p>It is a quality missing from the make-up of some of his rivals such as his compatriot Andre Agassi or indeed Ivanisevic, who can be brilliant on some days but pretty spineless on others.</p>
<p>Sampras has needed to draw on his concentration powers a great deal this year after the death of his coach and close friend Tim Gullikson.</p>
<p>The American did not have a perfect day against Kafelnikov, who hit some blistering shots from the back of the court at speeds which would have a motorist in trouble with the police on a motorway.</p>
<p>But Sampras soon got on top, making a break of serve in the first game. After saving break points against him in the sixth game, he had the first set after 33 minutes.</p>
<p>The second was tight but Sampras made another key break to lead 5-4 and then held , clinching the match with a superb drop volley.</p>
<p>Sampras could still face Becker in Sundays final. But the American said he was not looking further than the semifinal where Ivanisevic could cause him major problems on the fast court.</p>
<p>I am not thinking about it...Tomorrow will be another roller-coaster ride. If he serves and returns well he could blow me off court, Sampras said.</p>
