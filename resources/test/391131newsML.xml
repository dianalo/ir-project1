<p>Daye Special Steel Co Ltd plans to make an initial public offering of 70 million A shares through the Shenzhen exchange's automated quotation system in the near future, a company spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>China's largest brokerage Shenyin &amp; Wanguo Securities Co Ltd has been named as the main underwriter for the offer, he told the Hong Kong-based newsletter China Securities Bulletin.</p>
<p>The precise time and pricing had not been not fixed, he said.</p>
<p>Daye, based in Huangshi city in central Hubei province, plans to issue B shares after the A share offer, the official said, adding that plans for the second-batch equity issue had yet to be drafted.</p>
<p>Daye is one of 33 enterprises that have been approved by the Securities Commission of China's State Council, or cabinet, to list B shares.</p>
<p>The official said Daye would put the A share proceeds into the ongoing construction of a steel plant which became partially operational early in 1997, he said, giving no other details on the project.</p>
<p>He declined to provide profit figures for recent years.</p>
<p>Daye currently has total share capital of 209.22 million shares, composed of 171.22 million state shares, 15.2 million legal person shares and 22.8 million staff shares.</p>
