<p>The chief Senate investigator of campaign finance wrongdoing said Thursday there would be no vendetta against President Clinton and promised a sweeping investigation that would involve Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>Senate Governmental Affairs committee chairman Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican, spent two hours trying to convince the Senate Rules Committee he needed $6.5 million to conduct a far-reaching investigation into reports of illegal foreign donations, special White House favours to donors and other activities.</p>
<p>But Senate Democrats urged him to scale back his "unprecedented" $6.5 million request and Sen. John Glenn, an Ohil Democrat, described it as "an excessive, unjustified budget request."</p>
<p>The committee took no action but was expected to hold another session next week on the request for investigating money which also must be approved by the full Senate where Democrats may try to block the proposal.</p>
<p>While Thompson promised an investigation into questionable financing by both parties during the 1996 election, he made clear the focus would be on Democrats as he outlined a broad scope of the probe based on reports of alleged fundraising wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Thompson told the Rules Committee he was not out to get Clinton.</p>
<p>"I didn't come here to investigate or tear down or carry out a vendetta against President Clinton," Thompson said.</p>
<p>Once the funding hurdles were cleared, his committee planned to look into illegal or improper contributions, particularly money from foreigners who gave to Democrats and who were barred from donating to U.S. political campaigns in most cases.</p>
<p>Thompson's appearance before the Rules Committee was almost a rerun of two days of arguments within Thompson's own committee last week when he proposed spending $6.5 million, which Democrats claimed dwarfed initial spending of other past investigations, including the Senate select Watergate committee where Thompson served as minority counsel.</p>
<p>In the end Thompson's committee approved the $6.5 million. The Rules Committee and Senate must approve before he can hire some 80 investigative staffers in addition to regular committee staffers working on the investigation.</p>
<p>Thompson rejected Democratic requests during the Rules Committee session to arbitrarily limit the duration of the investigation or to start out with an initial $1.8 million and return to the Senate for more later if needed.</p>
<p>Thompson argued that the scope of the investigation was broad and included questions of whether foreign policy interests of the United States had been compromised.</p>
<p>He made clear in talking to reporters he disliked the threat of a filibuster -- or delaying tactics -- to block his $6.5 million request that was suggested by Senate Democratic leader Thomas Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat.</p>
<p>"I cannot give in to a filibuster threat," he said.</p>
