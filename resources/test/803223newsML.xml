<p>Allergan Ligand Retinoid Therapeutics Inc said Friday that accelerated spending could deplete funds available to it for research and development in late 1997 or early 1998.</p>
<p>Such a depletion, it said, could trigger certain purchase options over its callable common stock and assets, but there is no assurance that the options would be exercised by Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc and Allergan Inc.</p>
<p>The two companies perform research and development work for it under contract, it said.</p>
<p>Allergan Ligand announced a  research and development plan for fiscal 1997 on January 31. The plan aimed at a more rapid discovery and development of a significantly larger library of viable retinoid compounds, it said.</p>
<p>The company said its expenses for research and development were $9.6 million in the second quarter ended June 30 and $19.1 million for the first six months of 1997. That compares with $6.8 million in the second quarter and $12.7 million in the first six months of 1996.</p>
