<p>An Iraqi-backed Kurdish militia issued an amnesty on Tuesday for all members of the rival faction it defeated in a nine-day drive through northern Iraq and appealed to residents not to flee.</p>
<p>"KDP leader Massour Barzani has issued an amnesty to all PUK leaders and members," the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) said in a statement. "The party has called on all those who left the city (of Sulaimaniya) to return to their homes." Sulaimaniya was the last stronghold of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) conquered on Monday.  </p>
<p>"Strict instructions are laid down to prevent revenge killing and respect human rights and people's property," the statement said.</p>
<p>About the same time Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who backed the KDP, issued a general amnesty to Iraqi Kurds in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>The KDP statement accused the PUK, led by Jalal Talabani, of organising an exodus to the Iranian border in a what the KDP called a "propaganda" bid to draw world attention. It said the KDP was not surprised most reports of an exodus had emerged from Iran, which has backed the PUK.</p>
<p>At least 10,000 Kurdish refugees have fled northern Iraq for the Iranian border. U.N. officials have said they expect 75,000 refugees. Iran appealed for world aid for nearly 200,000 refugees.</p>
