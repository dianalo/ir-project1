<p>The long-awaited legislation covering South Africa's merged inland revenue and customs and excise departments was tabled in parliament on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The South African Revenue Service (SARS) Bill provides the new service, formed on April 1 last year, with administrative autonomy but stops short of the full autonomy that some lobbyists might have wanted.</p>
<p>The Bill said that Cabinet had agreed that SARS should become an administratively autonomous revenue service with its own Act and "a certain level of control over its own resources."</p>
<p>SARS would fall outside public service controls over levels of pay and conditions of service but would remain subject to the basic values and principles governing public administration.</p>
<p>SARS' basic functions would be to collect all national taxes, duties and levies, flat-rate surcharges on the provinces, and other revenue and to advise the Minister of Finance on all revenue-related matters.</p>
<p>These functions would be performed under the policy control of, and subject to directives and guidelines issued by, the finance minister.</p>
<p>It would have a wide range of powers, such as the appointment of employees and buying of property, within the guidelines set by government.</p>
<p>"These powers will enable SARS to exercise better and a greater degree of control over its financial and human resources," the Bill said.</p>
<p>SARS would have an advisory board and its chief source of income would be money voted by parliament.</p>
<p>"Such income will be determined in accordance with estimates of income and expenditure and must make adequate provision for SARS to perform its functions," the Bill said.</p>
