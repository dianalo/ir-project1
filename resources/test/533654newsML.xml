<p>Chrysler Corp will this Saturday begin selling a new Voyager minivan specifically designed to compete in the Japanese market, the U.S. automaker said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Left-hand-drive Voyagers are already sold in Japan by some independent smaller importer-dealers.</p>
<p>Prices for the new minivans will range from 3.19 million yen ($25,300) to 3.82 million yen ($30,300), Chrysler Japan Sales Ltd Chairman Keisuke Egashira told a news conference previewing the new model.</p>
<p>"We belive we have succeeded in pricing Voyager competitively for this market and versus other premium vehicles available to Japanese consumers," Egashira said.</p>
<p>He declined to reveal a sales target for the new vehicles.</p>
<p>"We have less experience on marketing this segment model in Japan so it is hard to set sales target," Egashira said.</p>
<p>He also said it was not necessarily true that Japan's auto market is closed to foreign imports, noting a slow but steady increase in imports in recent years.</p>
<p>"Carmakers which make cars which meet consumers' demands will win. Good products and a good sales network are the necessary elements for boosting sales in Japan. It is not up to the U.S. and Japanese governments," he said.</p>
<p>Japanese sales of Chrysler cars, including the Cherokee sport-utility vehicle, rose 6.6 percent in 1996 from a year earlier to 14,504 units.</p>
