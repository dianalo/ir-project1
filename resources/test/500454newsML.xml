<p>India's ruling United Front coalition said the Congress party had given it until 3 p.m. (0930 GMT) on Thursday to respond to its demand that Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda step down.</p>
<p>"Talks have not failed yet," United Front leader Ram Vilas Paswan told reporters. "We have time until 3 p.m."  </p>
<p>Paswan said the United Front was prepared to discuss policy issues and coordination with Congress, but the leadership issue was "non-negotiable".</p>
<p>Congress spokesman Vithal Gadgil confirmed that his party had issued instructions to members to vote against Deve Gowda in a vote of confidence on Friday.</p>
<p>Tariq Anwar, political secretary to Congress president Sitaram Kesri, said: "We stand by our demand for change in leadership. The talks have failed."</p>
<p>But Gadgil said he did not know if another round of talks would be held to try to resolve the political impasse.</p>
