<p>France's water levels, hit by weeks of dry weather, are worryingly low and unless it rains soon more regions may face water restrictions, environment minister Corinne Lepage said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We are in a worrying situation. Not alarming, but worrying. The water table is very low," Lepage told RTL radio in an interview.</p>
<p>She urged people voluntarily to cut their use of water and said partial irrigation bans might have to be extended to the north and west of the country.</p>
<p>Farmers in six provinces or departments in the centre of the country have been hit with partial irrigation bans due to the dry spell.</p>
<p>"Even when there are no restrictions, each us must be aware that water is a rare resource and that it must be used in an economical manner," Lepage said.</p>
<p>Fears of prolonged drought in France's grain regions pushed up the local price of wheat last week as grain traders worried about damage to crop yields.</p>
<p>The south of France is now suffering from a so-called agricultural drought, which starts to damage vegetation after about three weeks without rain but is reversible, the national meteorological service said last week.</p>
<p>France has had virtually no rain since January 25, it said.</p>
