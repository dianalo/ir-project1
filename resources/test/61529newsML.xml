<p>CBOT corn futures closed higher, led by a strong performance in the nearby September contract which is slated for expiration Thursday at 1201 CDT, traders said.</p>
<p>"The strength in the Septembers had a lot to do with the late recovery floorwide," said Mark Cermak of O'Connor and Co. "The lack of Septembers following the early weakness in the other months prevented the market from dropping."</p>
<p>Support also came from signs of cash-connected buying during the break, they said with the market again buffeted by uncertainty about the fate of this year's U.S. corn outturn.</p>
<p>"I think we're in a value area on corn, there's some end-user demand showing up," said Steve Bruce of E.D. and F. Man International.</p>
<p>Cargill Inc bought four million bushels of December, ADM Investor Services bought two million March and Refco Inc was a net buyer of 2.5 million bushels of December, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn ended steady to 4-1/4 cents a bushel up with September up 4-1/4 at $3.55-1/2. December was up one cent at $3.15-1/2.</p>
<p>Fund selling limited the gains as did Midwest weather.</p>
<p>Funds sold at least 10 million bushels on the day with Cargill Investor Services the chief seller of 9.0 million bushels, they said.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated at 70,000 contracts, up from 58,942 Wednesday, according to the CBOT.</p>
<p>In corn options, Smith Barney sold 1,000 December 1997 $2.80 puts at 14 to 15 cents, LFG Futures bought 900 December $3.10 puts and sold 900 December $3.40 puts at 20 cents, Paine Webber sold 500 December $3.40 calls at four cents, Term Commodities bought 600 December $4.20 calls at 3/8 cent and Refco Inc sold 500 December $3.30 calls at 6-1/2 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 24,000 contracts, down from 24,730 Wednesday.</p>
