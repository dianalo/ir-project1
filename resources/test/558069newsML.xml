<p>Polish right-wing activists scuffled with police on Saturday to prevent a prominent ex-communist laying a wreath during national day celebrations in the southern city of Krakow, PAP news agency said.</p>
<p>The trouble began when war veterans, members of the youthful Republican League and backers of the Reconstruction of Poland (ROP) movement tried to break through a police cordon shielding Andrzej Urbanczyk, a leader of the ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD).</p>
<p>Urbanczyk had to duck flying eggs and make a hasty retreat amid hostile jeers after laying his wreath at a memorial to Polish victims of Soviet atrocities.</p>
<p>Republican League leader Wojciech Polaczek was one of several protesters hurt in the fray, private Radio Zet reported.</p>
<p>"We cannot permit any organisation linked to the SLD to desecrate this cross of national memory by laying flowers here," PAP quoted Jerzy Bukowski, leader of an ex-servicemen's group, as saying.</p>
<p>In Warsaw, President Aleksander Kwasniewski, the former SLD leader, extolled  a controversial constitutional draft which he urged Poles to support in a referendum on May 25.</p>
<p>"The constitution is the fruit of a mature compromise which creates a modern, common and truly democratic state," Kwasniewski said in a televised speech at national day observances at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider.</p>
<p>The Solidarity movment, which brought about the collapse of communism in 1989, is calling on voters to reject the new constitution and argues that Kwasniewski, as head of state, should not campaign in its behalf.</p>
<p>On Thursday, backers of the Republican League tried to disrupt leftist Mayday marches and scuffled with police in several Polish cities.</p>
