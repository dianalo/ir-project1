<p>Police said on Tuesday they suspected a shadowy racist guerrilla group was behind the latest letter bomb blast in Austria while outraged politicians vowed the attacks would never destabilise the country.</p>
<p>Bomb squad police chief Robert Sturm said the letter bomb addressed to the step-mother of Interior Minister Caspar Einem bore all the hallmarks of the Bajuwarian Liberation Army (BLA).</p>
<p>"The bomb that exploded on Monday, addressed to Lotte Ingrisch, seems without doubt to have come from the Bajuwarian Liberation Army," Sturm told Austrian radio on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said the way the device was constructed was very similar to a score of other racially-motivated letter bombs sent by the BLA in a campaign which has shaken Austria for three years.</p>
<p>Many of the packages have been intercepted by police but more than half have exploded, causing injuries to targeted foreigners or people linked with refugee or immigrant causes.</p>
<p>The BLA has also claimed responsibility for the murders in February last year of four gypsy men, who were killed in a booby-trapped bomb blast.</p>
<p>"They will not succeed in destabilising our country with these attacks," Social Democrat (SPOe) security spokesman Walter Posch said. "Xenophobia has once again become a political force in Austria. Those who are trying to arouse fear in the people are enjoying some success."</p>
<p>Paul Kiss, of the SPOe's junior coalition partner, the People's Party, said the country had to unite to fight the BLA. "The methods being used by the perpetrators are perfidious and sick," he said.</p>
<p>Helene Partik-Pable of the far-right Freedom Party said the letter bomb was the work of a madman.</p>
<p>Einem, who had known he was on a BLA target list together with other politicians including Social Democrat Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, warned of a possible fresh wave of attacks.</p>
<p>"People who are working to integrate foreigners and are involved with humanitarian groups are particularly at risk," he told Austrian radio.</p>
<p>Monday's letter bomb, which caused no injuries, was addressed to Ingrisch, 66, who was married to Einem's father, composer Gottfried von Einem, who died in July, aged 78.</p>
<p>The package had been mailed to the home Ingrisch left a year ago and was returned to an astrological society which the bombers used as the purported sender.</p>
<p>Ingrisch suspected the bomb could be the work of old sympathisers active under the regime of Austrian-born Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler or younger neo-Nazi fanatics.</p>
<p>Some government sources believe the BLA to be a group obsessed with reuniting German-speaking peoples in Bavaria, the Alps and along the Danube River -- a region which existed between the sixth and 12th centuries.</p>
