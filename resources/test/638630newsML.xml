<p>Philippine shares skidded on Wednesday as the market entered into a consolidation phase after more than a week of gains, traders said.</p>
<p>The main index closed 6.67 points lower at 2,796.11.</p>
<p>The market was also pulled down by index heavyweight Metrobank due to rumours that San Carlos Milling Co is encountering problems with its sugar inventories. Metrobank is allegedly its biggest creditor, traders said.</p>
<p>"What caused the market to be defensive was the rumour that one bank may be in trouble because of its loans to a sugar company," said PCIBank Securities head of institutional sales Raul Zamora.  </p>
<p>Officials of Metrobank were not immediately available for comment but an official of San Carlos Milling denied the firm was experiencing financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Metrobank was the most actively traded stock. It ended 20 pesos lower, or 3.47 percent, at 555 pesos, while San Carlos was untraded.</p>
<p>Another index heavyweight San Miguel Corp ended slightly lower on the annnouncement that its share swap deal with Coca-Cola Amatil has been finalised. The deal had raised concerns among San Miguel shareholders that it was disadvantageous to the food and beer conglomerate.  </p>
<p>San Miguel A shares closed one peso lower at 49 pesos, while the B shares slipped 50 centavos to 78 pesos.</p>
<p>The main index traded in a narrow band for most of the session. In the broad market, decliners outnumbered gainers 58 to 50. Turnover improved to 2.36 billion pesos from 2.06 billion.</p>
<p>The market's performance on Thursday may be affected by the release of May inflation figures, said Diversified Securities executive vice-president Jose Ricardo Garcia.</p>
<p>"We may see some positioning on the inflation data," he said.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll of six analysts forecast the annual May inflation figure unchanged at 4.6 percent.</p>
