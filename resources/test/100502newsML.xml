<title>USA: Compaq to cut memory prices on its PC lines.</title>

<p>Compaq Computer Corp said Monday it would cut prices on the computer memory chip modules it sells to run within its desktop, portable and server computer lines by up to 65 percent.</p>
<p>The price cuts were part of Compaq's new build-to-order logistics program designed to cut the time between when a customer places an order and a product is delivered to less than 48 hours.</p>
<p>The company said its "Sterling Memory Initiative" will allow it to rapidly respond to falling component prices and rival pricing actions.  </p>
<p>Prices for most of the computer memory modules, which come in a range of speeds and layouts, were reduced between 35 and 45 percent.</p>
<p>As part of the plan, Compaq said it will now hold raw Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAMs) chips in inventory and assemble these key computer memories into specific product modules the day an order is received.</p>
<p>Based on the more rapid sales turnover and reduced inventory resulting from the build-to-order process, Compaq said it is able to immediately respond to falling component prices and competitive pricing actions by rival PC makers.</p>
<p>Compaq said it purchases memory exclusively from vendors which meet the computermaker's quality standards.</p>
<p>The company said its Sterling Memory Initiative will be implemented in Canada in the fourth quarter 1996.</p>
<p>The program will expand with select elements for the rest of the world in first quarter 1997.</p>
