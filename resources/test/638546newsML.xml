<p>Yen-based nearby months of Tokyo palladium futures ended sharply higher on Wednesday, following a jump in spot palladium prices during Asian hours, traders said.</p>
<p>Reflecting the extremely tight spot palladium market, short-term lease rates soared to nearly 90-100 percent, against about the usual two or three percent, while short-term platinum lease rates rocketed to about 50 percent.</p>
<p>Spot June palladium, which has no daily limit, rose by 56 yen at 700 yen. "The market was too speculative. Funds led by Tiger Fund are trying to squeeze the market," one trader said.  </p>
<p>"It's a real mess," one trader said. "The extremely volatile moves amid scarce metals in the market made traders wary of arbitrage trade between TOCOM futures and the spot market."</p>
<p>Spot palladium prices were quoted at $215.00/220.00 per ounce at 0734 GMT.</p>
<p>TOCOM benchmark April ended flat at 584 yen.</p>
<p>Despite expectations that Russia would resume PGM exports soon, a large overhang of TOCOM short positions and the attempt by funds to sqeeze the market are likely to require some time for the market to sort out and return to normal, traders said.  </p>
<p>Backwardation between the spot TOCOM June and benchmark April widened sharply due to the tight nearby supply trends.</p>
<p>Benchmark April platinum was off 13 yen at 1,380 yen.</p>
<p>Gold and silver futures ended moderately lower in lacklustre trade after the German government compromised with the Bundesbank of its plan to revalue the bank's gold reserves.</p>
<p>In the spot market, bullion was quoted at $342.90/343.20 per ounce at 0905 GMT, against $343.00/50 in New York on Tuesday. Benchmark April gold was flat at 1,280 yen, while benchmark April silver was down 0.4 yen per 10 grams at 178.0 yen.  --Tokyo Commodities Desk, +81-3-3432-7431</p>
