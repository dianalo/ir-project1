<p>The British army may reinstate a ban on a popular holiday resort in Cyprus after four soldiers were arrested over the weekend for an assault on British tourists there, a spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>Four British soldiers stationed in Cyprus are due in a local court on Tuesday on charges of attacking the two tourists at the holiday resort of Ayia Napa on Saturday night.</p>
<p>"Each of the four has been charged by Cyprus police with assault occasioning grevious bodily harm," said Mervyn Wynne-Jones, a spokesman for the British military bases in Cyprus.</p>
<p>Cyprus police identified the accused as Roger Pell, 26, Tim Carter, 27, Steven Wolstencroft, 26, and Steven Girvan, 20. They are all members of the 600-strong Kings Regiment based in Dhekelia.</p>
<p>The two alleged victims, aged 23, were both tourists from Britain on holiday at Ayia Napa, a sprawling holiday resort on the south eastern coast popular with off-duty British soldiers from the nearby Dhekelia base.</p>
<p>A police report said that Shane Bell and Barry Ford, from south east London, were reportedly attacked by the four soldiers while standing outside a local disco with their girlfriends.</p>
<p>Bell suffered a broken jaw and will need surgery, the report said.</p>
<p>"Commander, British Forces, views this matter with considerable concern and every assistance is being offered to Cyprus police in their investigation of this incident," said Wynne-Jones.</p>
<p>He said the commander would closely follow the case and a resumption of out of bound restrictions is likely to be imposed on the unit concerned.</p>
<p>"Certainly there will be some form of restriction imposed on members of this particular unit," he said.</p>
<p>The British army slapped a ban on troops visits to Ayia Napa between September 1994 and July 1996 after the brutal killing of a Danish tour guide by three drunk British soldiers.</p>
<p>Two months ago the British army banned training visits of the Royal Marines after three of them were arrested at an Ayia Napa pub dancing and singing "God Save the Queen" in the nude.</p>
<p>Wynne-Jones said cases of indiscipline among soldiers were few and far between.</p>
<p>Some 3,500 British troops are stationed on two military bases Britain retained in Cyprus, a former colony, after independence in 1960.</p>
