<p>Russia's ambassador has confirmed that a body found last week in a violent region of northwestern Colombia was that of a Russian cyclist who disappeared last year, it was reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Ambassador Ednan Aagev told reporters Wednesday that his embassy was "99 percent certain" that the body unearthed on Friday in the banana-growing region of Uraba, near Colombia's border with Panama, was that of 43-year-old cyclist Vasili Lojkin, according to Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper.</p>
<p>Lojkin was on a worldwide bicycle tour commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Olympic Games when he disappeared in February last year. His destination was to have been the summer Olympics in Atlanta.</p>
<p>According to Colombian officials, residents of an isolated area of Uraba called Lomas Aisladas said leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels stopped the cyclist there and accused him of spying for a right-wing paramilitary group.</p>
<p>He was shot on the spot, but residents later buried him instead of following guerrilla orders to cut him to pieces and dump the remains in a nearby river.</p>
<p>Lojkin's passport and other identity papers were found on a FARC rebel killed in combat in Uraba in March last year.</p>
<p>Guerrillas and extreme rightists have been fighting for more than a decade for control over lucrative drug and arms smuggling routes through the region, on the Caribbean coast.</p>
<p>Agaev was quoted by El Tiempo as saying he would call for international condemnation of Lojkin's murder. He also said that if guerrillas committed the crime they had "no moral right to call themselves fighters for social justice."</p>
<p>Two European backpackers, a German and an Austrian, were killed last week when soldiers stormed a camp near the Panama border where they were being held hostage by FARC rebels.</p>
