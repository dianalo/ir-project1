<p>The German government refused on Thursday to abandon sweeping tax reform plans, but looked certain to be thwarted by an opposition determined to block the measures until next year's general election.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel suffered a major blow when the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) voted down his plan to slice 30 billion marks ($16.3 billion) off the national tax bill in parliament's mediation committee in the early hours of Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Undeterred, he said he would still try to invoke the conflict-resolution process again this autumn to try to force the SPD into a change of heart.</p>
<p>"We'll keep the big tax reform on the agenda," he told a news conference in Bonn, insisting the government still wanted to bring in as much of the reform as possible.</p>
<p>"If this doesn't happen, then the SPD alone must bear the responsibility." he said. "The SPD is moving at a snail's pace when it comes to tax reform."</p>
<p>The two sides did manage to salvage a face-saving deal to abolish a capital trading tax on companies after 15 hours of talks in the mediation committee.</p>
<p>But the SPD said it saw little chance of a compromise on the main tax plan unless the government made major concessions.</p>
<p>"I fear this mediation process will end the same way the last one ended last night," SPD chief whip Peter Struck said. "We're prepared to talk but I'm very sceptical."</p>
<p>Waigel's reform plan would slash income and corporate taxes in a bid to fight record post-war unemployment and replicate the success of earlier reforms in the U.S. and Britain, where growth is stronger than in Germany and unemployment is lower.</p>
<p>But while the strategy may be broadly the same, Germany's hardened political fronts rule out the type of cross-party deal which has just been struck by Democrats and Republicans to cut U.S. taxes and balance the budget in the long term.</p>
<p>Newspaper commentators said the difference between Bonn and Washington could not be more stark.</p>
<p>"Helmut (Kohl) is a long way from doing what Bill (Clinton) has done," the Boersen Zeitung daily said. "The way it looks now, the tax reform will only occur in the year 2000 even in the most favourable case; that means lost years up until then."</p>
<p>The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) noted the contrast in the ability of the two countries to gain political consensus, once seen as one of post-war Germany's great strengths.</p>
<p>"Two worlds. With pragmatism and common sense, the Americans have handed themselves a lowering of capital taxes to keep their economy on the upswing," the FAZ wrote.</p>
<p>"In Germany, a tax reform that would have offered a realistic chance of offering hope to the jobless has collapsed on ideological differences."</p>
<p>German business leaders slammed the stalemate as "a tax policy fiasco". They warned that more firms could be pushed into bankruptcy, and unemployment -- already over four million -- would increase further.</p>
<p>"The failure of the tax reform is a declaration of bankruptcy over Germany's ability to reform," said Martin Kohlhaussen, President of the Association of German Banks and Commerzbank AG's chairman.</p>
<p>"It is irresponsible that the chance of a fundamental new start has been wasted because of party political manoeuvering."</p>
<p>Independent economists said the failure of the tax reforms meant companies would remain overtaxed, jobs and investment would be driven abroad, and growth dampened.</p>
<p>German competitiveness would also be undermined just as the country tries to get into shape for European economic and monetary union (EMU), planned to start in 1999, they said.</p>
<p>"This big tax gap is an invitation for companies to look at transferring profits to other countries if possible, which means the investment cycle will be weaker in Germany and the labour market could continue to have problems," said Guenter Redeker, senior economist at Chase Investment Bank in London.
