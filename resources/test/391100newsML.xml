<headline>Malaysia says can't arrest Italian in Bofors probe.</headline>

<p>Malaysian police said on Thursday they cannot arrest an Italian businessman named by Indian investigators in a $1.3 billion gun deal probe due to lack of information, the Bernama news agency reported.</p>
<p>"Very flimsy information has been submitted by the Indian Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) for the extradition of Quattrocchi and his wife," a spokesman for the police legal prosecution division was quoted by Bernama as saying.</p>
<p>Police officials were not available for comment on the Bernama report.</p>
<p>Ottavio Quattrocchi was the representative of Italian engineering firm Snamprogetti Spa in New Delhi when India signed the gun deal with Swedish company Bofors AB in 1986. He now lives in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Quattrocchi and his wife, Maria, were among five people named by Indian investigators as recipients of payments made by Bofors. He and Snamprogetti have denied any involvement in the alleged payments.</p>
<p>Two CBI officers, Revanna Siddaiah and N.R. Wasan, arrived in Malaysia on Friday with warrants for Quattrocchi's arrest. They could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>The Malaysian police spokesman said the two CBI officers had been advised to provide more concrete facts to help the Malaysian police in its investigations.</p>
<p>"We cannot wrongfully arrest and Quattrocchi can sue us and the reputation of the Malaysian police can be tarnished. The case is related to an alleged offence committed in India and we are in no way connected and any wrong move would affect our relations," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Malaysia does not have an extradition treaty with India but an extradition order could be made by the court if the home minister or his deputy apply for one after referring the case to the Attorney-General under the Extradition Act of 1992.</p>
