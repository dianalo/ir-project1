<p>A New Mexico jury on Wednesday found Chrysler Corp. negligent in designing faulty rear-door latches on its older minivans, but ruled the automaker was not responsible for a woman's death and injuries to five other people in a minivan crash.</p>
<p>The jury in Santa Rosa, N.M., ruled the vehicle's driver was to blame in the crash and awarded no damages against Chrysler.</p>
<p>However, the case marks the first jury verdict involving Chrysler's controversial rear-door latch on its 1984-95 minivans, according to auto safety critic Ralph Hoar.</p>
<p>Hoar and others mounted an unsuccessful campign two years ago to pressure Chrysler into recalling the vehicles, asserting the latches were prone to pop open in rear-impact crashes, causing unbelted passengers to be thrown out of the vans.</p>
<p>In the New Mexico case, the plaintiffs alleged that in the July 1995 crash, five people were thrown from the minivan because the latch was defective. But the jury found that the passengers were ejected through a side windown, not the rear door opening.</p>
<p>In March 1995, Chrysler struck a deal with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to voluntary replace the latches with a stronger version in some 4.5 million minivans without a formal recall or a finding that the latches were defective.</p>
<p>Hoar, president of an Arlington, Va., auto safety consulting firm used by plaintiff attorneys, also is critical of Chrysler's handling of the replacement program and says 2 million of the vans with the original latches are still on U.S. roads.</p>
<p>"It should come as no surprise that Chrysler wants to settle these suits. It knows its latch and its behavior are indefensible," he said.</p>
<p>A Chrysler representative was not immediately available to comment on the verdict late Wednesday.</p>
