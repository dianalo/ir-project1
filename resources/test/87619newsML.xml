<p>Economic progress in Russia and the emergence of a democratic system that its people can identify with and trust will be crucial for future stability in Europe, the Finnish government said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a report to the national parliament titled 'Finland and the future of Europe', the government said a desirable scenario for Europe's future would be marked by cooperation instead of confrontation and predictability instead of instability.</p>
<p>"Stability -- economic progress and consolidation of democratic practices -- in Russia is crucial to this end," the report said.</p>
<p>Finland took a decisive step by joining the EU in 1995.</p>
<p>While stressing that membership of the European Union was "the cornerstone of Finland's policy on Europe", the government dedicated a whole chapter of the report to the future of Russia.</p>
<p>"(Russia) is still essentially a European country oriented towards the West," Finland said, referring to the eastern neighbour with which it shares a 1,300 km (800 miles) border.</p>
<p>But Russia was in many ways different from other European countries, the Finnish government said, pointing at the concentration of economic and political power in the hands of elite groups.</p>
<p>The Russian political system -- apparently evolving towards a strong presidency and democratic procedures based on a market economy -- could pose problems in the future.</p>
<p>"Confinement of political influence to the elite is bound to increase citizen alienation and damage the legitimacy of the system," the report said, adding: "In unfavourable circumstances, this could foster instability."</p>
<p>"Growing income disparities, the sudden rise in mortality, crime ... and immesurably vast environmental problems are factors which may jeopardise the current favourable trend," it said.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge for Russian democracy was how to make citizens feel that the institutions of society are relevant.</p>
<p>"Russia has virtually no experience of a modern state or a democratic society ... By and large, the Soviet State was never based on the idea that people should feel that the system was 'their own'," the Finnish government noted.</p>
<p>Negative aspects of the current transition in Russia towards a capitalist market economy had impaired public faith in and respect for the political system, it said.</p>
<p>Unless Russian leaders came up with credible rules of the game, the outcome would be "value anarchy", Finland said.</p>
<p>It was important to turn traditionally strong Russian nationalism into a positive force.</p>
<p>"If the political system does not provide nationalism with a constructive outlet, it may be transformed and turn in an undesirable direction," the report said.</p>
<p>Great power status was important to Russian identity and NATO plans for eastward enlargement "have caused serious concern in Russia," Finland said.</p>
<p>Besides proposing alternative security policy solutions for Europe, Russia was seeking greater influence in CIS countries and Asia.</p>
<p>The latter "would certainly be reflected in a stronger position vis-a-vis the West," the Finnish government report said.</p>
<p>It said Russia was taking a favourable view of European Union enlargement.</p>
<p>"Eastward enlargement is a significantly more difficult issue for the EU than for the individual countries concerned," Finland said.</p>
<p>For the EU, the fundamental difficulty was the difference in standards of living between EU countries and East Europe's transition economies.</p>
<p>"The gulf in standards of living between Finland and its nearby regions is among the widest in Europe," the government said, referring to Russia and the Baltic republics.</p>
<p>"It is therefore among Finland's top priorities to narrow that gulf and promote stable, sustainable development in these regions," it said.</p>
