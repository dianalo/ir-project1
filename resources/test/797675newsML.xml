<p>The European Commission said on Wednesday it had cleared the acquisition by a German subsidiary of ADM International Ltd and Acatos &amp; Hutcheson Plc of German soybeans processor Soya Mainz GmbH.</p>
<p>It said in a statement that although the companies involved are big players in the affected markets -- oil meals, edible oils and Lecithins -- the transaction would not result in the creation of a dominant position in the European Union.</p>
<p>It particularly noted that worldwide Lecithin supply exceeds demand and that the companies had guaranteed they would continue the existing supply arrangements with independent wholesaler Lukas Meyer. Lecithin is a product sold in health food shops to reduce cholesterol absorption.</p>
<p>"Although the parties are highly vertically integrated and these markets are highly concentrated, the joint venture does not lead to a dominant position," the statement said.</p>
<p>A Commission source had told Reuters on Tuesday that the deal had been cleared.</p>
<p>Soya Mainz said in June it had been sold to Archer-Daniels-Midland's ADM Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH and Acatos, a British company active in the bottling and canning of vegetable oils. It was previously owned by the Wilh. Werhahn group and Heidelberger Zement AG.</p>
<p>The sale was filed for EU regulatory approval on July 8.</p>
<p>ADM already has a controlling stake in leading German processor Oelmuehle Hamburg AG, which in 1996 crushed 3.10 million tonnes of soybeans. -- Amelia Torres 322 2876841</p>
