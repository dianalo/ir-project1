<p>Jakarta call money rose to 13.5 percent from 11.5 percent on Friday morning following some tightening in the money market, dealers said.</p>
<p>They attributed the rise to larger than expected weekly tax payments amid an early central bank injection of some 715 billion rupiah on the market.</p>
<p>Overnight swaps were also driven up by the tightening to 2.0 points from 1.35 points at the opening.</p>
<p>However, longer-term rates were stable, with one-month money quoted at 13.75/14.00 percent and three-month at 15.0/15.125. Longer-term swap rates were also stable.</p>
<p>The average overnight interbank rate on Thursday was 9.92 percent, compared with 10.46 percent on Wednesday.</p>
