<p>The influx of expensive foreign stars pushed English soccer into the red to the tune of almost 100 million pounds ($162 million) in the 1995/96 season, a study released on Wednesday showed.</p>
<p>Income for England's 92 professional clubs rose more than 10 percent to 517 million pounds ($839.9 million) in the season before last, accountancy firm Deloitte &amp; Touche said. But pre-tax losses climbed to 98.2 million ($159.5 million) as wages spiralled higher and transfer money flowed abroad.</p>
<p>"Much of the overall loss was due to the influx of overseas players into the English game -- and that's affecting the game at all levels," said Gerry Boon, head of Deloitte &amp; Touche's football industry team.</p>
<p>"English football is financing a fair slug of football in Italy and other countries," he added at a news conference, noting that clubs were now recruiting abroad rather than buying from smaller English rivals.</p>
<p>Clubs spent 93 million pounds ($151.1 million) on overseas players in 1995/96, treble the amount the previous year. That trend continued last season as premier league clubs such as Chelsea recruited Italians Gianfranco Zola and Roberto di Matteo following the European championships.</p>
<p>The report ranked English champions Manchester United the biggest club in Europe and probably the world, putting their turnover ahead of that of Germany's Bayern Munich, Italy's AC Milan and Juventus and Spaniards Barcelona.</p>
<p>English soccer has enjoyed a boom since the premier league was launched five years ago, television pumping vast sums of money into the game and crowds flocking to new stadia to watch some of the world's top players.</p>
<p>Financial institutions have woken up to soccer's potential as a leisure business and 18 clubs are now listed on the London stock exchange. A number of foreign clubs are now considering floating in London.</p>
<p>Published as English clubs prepare for a new campaign beginning this weekend, the report cited wage increases as a major cause for concern. Premier league wages soared 25 percent in 1995/96.</p>
<p>The report also highlighted the growing financial gap between the 20-team premier league and the rest.</p>
<p>The premier league generated around two-thirds of total income in 1995/96 and the average premier league club had a profit of 2.6 million pounds ($4.2 million) before transfer spending. Average clubs in all other divisions reported increased losses.</p>
<p>Boon said the new deal between the premier league and pay television operator BSkyB would accentuate the divide between soccer's 'haves' and 'have nots'.</p>
<p>The average premier league club can expect television revenue of 5.5 million pounds ($8.9 million) this season while the best those outside can hope for is around one million ($1.6 million).</p>
<p>Boon forecast 'some pretty horrendous balance sheets over the next couple of years' as lower division clubs pay high wages and transfer fees as they scramble to join the big money premier league.</p>
<p>He said smaller clubs could be run as profitable businesses providing proper financial control was exercised. "It's down to the chairman's ability to say 'no'," he said.</p>
