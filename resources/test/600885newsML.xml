<p>BTG Inc said Wednesday it has obtained waivers from certain convenants in loan agreements with its lenders, following its incurring a net loss of $481,000 or $0.05 a share, for the fourth quarter ended March 31.</p>
<p>In a statement, the information technology products and services company said that the net loss had put it out of compliance of certain loan agreement covenants.</p>
<p>It did not specify what those covenants were.</p>
<p>In the statement, Edward Bersoff, president and chief executive officer of the company, expressed disappointment over the fourth-quarter results, which he said were due to unexpected events.</p>
<p>He said those events included cost pressures related to the company's rapid expansion, increased costs of investment in current projects and one-time charges.</p>
<p>He said the one-time charges included higher than expected costs of consolidating Washington-area facilities, a client's bankruptcy and an increase in reserves associated with other commercial business.</p>
