<p>Mexico will allow 331,000 tonnes of U.S. soybean meal to be imported duty free this year, the local office of the American Soybean Association (ASA) said in a report obtained Monday.</p>
<p>"The unconfirmed report is that about 331,000 tonnes of meal will be duty free for the livestock industry in general," the ASA said. Current soybean meal import tariffs are at 12 percent.  </p>
<p>Government officials from the Agriculture or Trade Ministries were not immediately available to confirm or deny the report.</p>
<p>The ASA said the mechanism for acquiring the duty free permits has not been made public, although its report speculated it would be in the standard form of a auction among trade organisations bidding for volumes for members.</p>
<p>"If this procedure is followed, the pork producers association will bid for pork producers, the poultry association for for poultry producers and so on," the ASA said.</p>
