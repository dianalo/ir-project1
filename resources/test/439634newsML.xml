<p>The state of Ohio plans to reject the proposed $299.5 million acquisition of most of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ohio by a for-profit hospital chain, Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.</p>
<p>The state said the deal was not in the public interest and could adversely affect policyholder interests.</p>
<p>A Columbia spokeswoman said Thursday the company had just received the state's documents and was not prepared to comment. "We are in the process of ... studying the implications," spokeswoman Eve Hutcherson said. "The next steps are not clear to us at this point."</p>
<p>"The superintendent of insurance intends to disapprove the proposed transaction," the Ohio Department of Insurance said in a statement issued late Wednesday.</p>
<p>Not-for-profit Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Ohio has 30 days to request a hearing on the decision.</p>
<p>The state questioned the valuation of the deal and payments that would be made to some Blue Cross executives and board members and said Blue Cross did not adequately solicit other suitors.</p>
<p>Columbia had reached an agreement to buy most of Blue Cross last March.</p>
<p>A Blue Cross of Ohio spokeswoman said the insurer had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>The ruling comes amid turmoil in Blue Cross's executive offices after the insurer said it lost $95 million in 1996. Earlier this week, Chief Executive Officer John Burry sought to fire President Kent Clapp. Then the insurer's board, including Clapp, voted to oust Burry.</p>
<p>Spokeswoman Suzanne Martin said it remained unclear who will end up at the helm.</p>
<p>The Columbia deal had been under fire from various fronts, including the Chicago-based national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, Ohio's attorney general and various groups representing some policyholders, consumers and trade unions.</p>
<p>Columbia/HCA has 343 hospitals and 147 surgery centres plus other types of facilities. In 1996 it earned $1.5 billion $2.22 a share on revenues of $19.9 billion.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts said the rejection should have little impact on Nashville-based Columbia/HCA, the nation's largest provider of health care services, because the deal was relatively small for a company of its size.</p>
<p>"This is not an issue in any way, shape or form," said Todd Richter, a health care services analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
