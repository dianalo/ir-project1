<p>Italian soccer club Juventus has no immediate intention of seeking a stock market listing, the club's honorary president Umberto Agnelli said in an interview with weekly magazine Panorama.</p>
<p>The Turin-based European Cup holders are currently leading Italy's Serie A. Recently, industrial group Fiat transferred its 42 percent holding in Juventus to the Agnelli family holding company IFI.</p>
<p>"Juventus does not intend to seek this (listing) on the bourse. At the moment, there are no conditions for such an outcome," Agnelli said in the magazine interview.</p>
<p>He added that to obtain a listing on the stock market, a soccer club has to show a strong balance sheet and preferably a profit.</p>
<p>A number of Italian soccer clubs, such as AC Milan and Bologna, have said they intend to seek a stock market listing. Italian media have suggested they might seek a listing in London where a company does not need to show a profit history before flotation.</p>
<p>Another top Italian soccer club, Parma, was more cautious. Calisto Tanzi, whose family controls Parma, said in an another interview in the same magazine that such a decision would require more consideration.</p>
