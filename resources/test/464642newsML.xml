<p>Australian Kaolin NL said on Monday it hds reached agreements to sell at least 80 percent of the 75,000 tonnes of kaolin it plans to produce from a new mine in Queensland state next year.</p>
<p>Australian Kaolin said it had signed supply agreements with two international trading houses and would enter into an agreement with a third soon.</p>
<p>"This is a major step in getting this project off the ground because without a committed market nothing can happen," Australian Kaolin executive director, Graham Keys said.  </p>
<p>The trading houses have agreed to take a total of 60,000 tonnes of calcined kaolin in the first year of operation from a plant that will have a first year production capacity of 75,000 tonnes, the company said.</p>
<p>Australian Kaolin earlier this month said it would proceed with development of the project, located near the Skardon River ion the Cape York Peninsula, at a cost of A$60 million.</p>
<p>The agreements were reached with German chemical group Chemag Aktiengesellschaft covering Europe, Africa and the Middle East and Nissho Iwai Corp for Japan.  </p>
<p>An agreement with Lomas International of the United States is expected to be finalised shortly, Keys said.</p>
<p>Western Europe, Japan and the United States represent over 80 percent of the production in printing and writing paper - the major market for the type of kaolin produced by Australian Kaolin, it said.</p>
<p>Chemag has agreed to take a minimum of 30,000 tonnes of calcined kaolin in the first year.</p>
<p>Nissho Iwai will take at least 10,000 tonnes and Lomas is expected to take 20,000 tonnes, Keys said.  </p>
<p>"This is a very good start and we are confident of signing up orders for the remaining 20 percent of our production in view of discussions taking place with distributors and paper and pulp producers in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Korea and Taiwan," Keys said. The commitments are subject to competitive pricing and meeting customer specifications, the company said.</p>
<p>Calcined kaolin, which fetches a premium over some other types of kaolin due to its brightening affect on paper, is currently priced at between US$450 and $500 a tonne.  </p>
<p>Closure last year of Australia's largest kaolin mine, operated by Comalco Ltd at Weipa, Queensland, has opened up more opportunities for Australian producers, although the composition of the Comalco material required further downstream processing to achieve the same brightness, Keys said.</p>
<p>Australian Kaolin said it aimed to start production in the middle of next year.</p>
