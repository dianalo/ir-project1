<p>When EU leaders meet in Dublin this week to review progress on a new EU treaty, they will find a rough outline of what is expected to emerge from the talks but that little else has been agreed, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Heads of state and government from the 15 European Union nations are to meet in the Irish capital on Saturday to discuss the bloc's preparations for the next century.</p>
<p>At issue is the so-called inter-governmental conference (IGC), a treaty-writing excercise designed to get the EU in shape to handle an influx of new members from eastern Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The talks began in March, and to date have generally followed a plan laid out for them first by the Italians, who held the EU presidency until June, and then by the Irish, who took over.</p>
<p>This has entailed systematic discussions of various areas to be covered by the review, collecting countries' views, and recently, drafting potential treaty language.</p>
<p>But no firm agreements have been reached -- only what Dutch European Affairs Minister Michiel Patijn, one of the negotiators, calls "the contours" of a future treaty.</p>
<p>"If you schedule a conference for 15 months, you can't expect (too much progress) after six," Patijn told Reuters in a recent interview. Most negotiators expect a frienzied phase of horse-trading next year just before the IGC's scheduled end.</p>
<p>But others have become stingingly critical of the pace of the talks, charging that the IGC has got nowhere and needs a big boost from the EU leaders on Saturday.</p>
<p>"We have spent over a year going around in circles like whirling dervishes...and we have not made even half a centimetre of progress," French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said on Sunday. He was including preparatory talks in his time-frame.</p>
<p>What the leaders will find on Saturday is that the areas that the new treaty is likely to cover have been identified, but that specific pacts remain a long way off.</p>
<p>The new treaty is widely expected to include a so-called employment chapter, designed to put job creation at the top of the EU's agenda. This is supported by a majority of states, negotiators say.</p>
<p>It is also likely to build on previous pledges to create a strong pan-European foreign policy. There is widespread support for a new forward planning unit to be created and for some kind of senior figure to be appointed as coordinator.</p>
<p>There is also general acceptance that EU institutions and procedures will have to be changed to accommodate new members.</p>
<p>But there is no agreement on how this is to be done, with Britain, in particular, holding out against any loss of sovereignty in the name of efficiency.</p>
<p>Small countries are also fighting moves to cut the number of EU commissioners or their role as EU presidents.</p>
<p>Overall, negotiators say, the most significant new proposal may be to incorporate so-called flexibility into the treaty -- a concept allowing some countries to integrate faster or deeper than others.</p>
<p>"Flexibility may suit those who want to press ahead, and it may suit those who do not want to join them," Irish negotiator Noel Dorr said.</p>
