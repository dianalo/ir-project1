<p>An airport in China's southeastern city of Xiamen is preparing for the landing of a Taiwan airliner hijacked earlier on Monday, an airport official said.  </p>
<p>"Officials are at the airport preparing for the plane's landing," the official said by telephone.</p>
<p>Far Eastern flight 128, a Boeing 757 with a capacity of 201 passengers, had departed from Taiwan's southern port city of Kaohsiung on a scheduled route to Taipei when it changed course and headed toward China's communist mainland.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known how many passengers and crew were aboard.</p>
<p>Aviation sources contacted by Reuters in Taiwan said a lone hijacker, said to be a journalist, doused himself with gasoline and ordered the pilot to fly to the Fujian province port of Xiamen.</p>
