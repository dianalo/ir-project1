<p>AirTouch Communications Inc. and U S West Media Group on Friday announced a $5 billion deal that would sharply expand AirTouch's wireless communications business in the United States.</p>
<p>Under the deal, AirTouch would take control of U S West's domestic wireless businesses, adding 1.9 million customers in U.S. regions that have up to 34 million potential customers.</p>
<p>In return, San Francisco-based Airtouch would grant U S West Media Group shareholders between 85 million or 93 million new shares, depending on Airtouch's trading price, tax free. That would amount to 14 to 16 percent of Airtouch once the shares were issued.</p>
<p>Airtouch would also assume $2.2 billion of U S West debt under the deal, leaving the stock portion worth about $2.8 billion by the companies' estimate.</p>
<p>AirTouch common stock closed on Thursday down 25 cents at $23.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>"The combination of our U.S. wireless operations with those of U S West will mark a major milestone for AirTouch, bolstering both our operating scale and expanding our footprint to reach over 212 million people worldwide," Sam Ginn, AirTouch's chairman and CEO, said in a statement.</p>
<p>In the United States, Airtouch reached about 57 million potential cellular customers at the end of 1986, according to a company fact sheet. It also had 3.4 million U.S. cellular customers.</p>
<p>Richard McCormick, chairman of Englewood, Colo.-based U S West, said that both companies began a partnership in 1994 with the aim of creating a single wireless company.</p>
<p>"But this transaction recognises the changing competitive environment, eliminates potential business conflicts, reduces our debt and allows our shareowners to receive AirTouch stock tax free," McCormick said in a statement.</p>
<p>U S West Media stock -- representing the wireless, directory and interactive media properties of regional communications company U S West -- closed down 25 cents at $17.25 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The U S West businesses include NewVector, its domestic cellular business, and its interest in PrimeCo Personal Communications, a venture with Airtouch and Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile. U S West will keep its overseas wireless properties.</p>
<p>The companies said customers of U S West Media Group's cellular service will notice no change, because the Media Group's cellular operations began using the AirTouch brand about a year ago.</p>
<p>Media Group's domestic cellular employees will generally follow their work, and become AirTouch employees once the transaction is final, they added.</p>
<p>The companies said the deal could close by the end of the year but is complicated by new legislation introduced in Congress. If the legislation passes, the companies would continue with their existing joint venture agreement.</p>
