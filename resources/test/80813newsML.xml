<p>Sustainable economic growth and tame inflation in the United States, combined with Japan's desire for a weaker yen and the mark's recent slump against other European currencies, could keep the dollar rallying even if the Federal Reserve does not tighten credit this year.</p>
<p>"As long as growth moderates towards (the) 2.0 percent level and we don't see consumer price inflation pick up, the dollar can rise in that environment," said Chris Widness, an international economist at Chase Securities Inc.  </p>
<p>The dollar outlook would deteriorate, he said, if the U.S. economy weakened too much, causing concern about recession.</p>
<p>The Fed surprised financial markets on Tuesday by leaving short-term rates unchanged. The decision, however, seemed providential after weak durable goods orders reported on Thursday fueled doubt that the Fed will tighten this year.</p>
<p>The dollar closed lower on Tuesday in New York after the U.S. central bank held rates steady but began to recover in Japan on Wednesday amid talk the Bank of Japan had purchased dollars. On Friday afternoon, the dollar traded around 110.80 yen and 1.5240 marks.  </p>
<p>"Longer term, meaning over the course of the next three to six months, the Japanese have every reason to shoot for the 130 (yen per dollar) level which is the level that Mr. Sakakibara has mentioned in the past as being a level he thinks would be acceptable," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Eisuke Sakakibara, director-general of the international finance bureau at Japan's Ministry of Finance's (MOF), said Japan has no specific target for the dollar/yen exchange rate but any level justified by fundamentals is good.  </p>
<p>Sakakibara is also called 'Mr Yen' because he is seen as primarily responsible for driving the dollar back above 100 yen through a series of financial market deregulation measures.</p>
<p>In an interview in the September 30 international edition of Business Week magazine, Sakakibara said, "As long as this Japanese capital outflow continues, we are going to be looking at a strengthening dollar." He termed the U.S. a "nice place" to invest compared with Europe, Asia and Latin America.  </p>
<p>Sakakibara told Business Week the typical Japanese life insurance company has reduced its foreign-currency denominated assets from about 15 percent to 5.0 percent in recent years but there will be an adjustment back to 10 to 15 percent in two or three years as Japanese rates remain low and yields on Japanese government bonds will be below 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute of International Economics, said he believed Japanese authorities were seeking a weaker yen to fuel an export-led expansion.  </p>
<p>Bergsten, recently returned from a trip to Asia, said figures running from 115 to 125 yen per dollar were mentioned in his discussions with the Japanese.</p>
<p>Although Weinberg and Widness said further dollar gains were possible, they warned the move higher may be sidetracked.</p>
<p>Weinberg, who deemed dollar/yen the "driving force" behind the dollar rally, cited risk of a temporary pullback towards 109.50 yen once the Japanese fiscal mid-year ends on Monday.</p>
<p>Widness emphasized the possibility the dollar rally could peter out and the mark firm slightly if the trend towards convergence trades in Europe should slow.  </p>
<p>"Right now I think that the dollar's rally (against the mark) is based more on these convergence trades in Europe," Widness said, adding "those will calm down and I wouldn't be surprised if the market starts to have second doubts on how much of a lock there is on European Monetary Union by 1998."</p>
<p>Widness said "these rallies" of other currencies against the mark "will peter out" by the end of the year and the mark "will look a little firmer" against the dollar and other currencies, he said.</p>
<p>Recent ballooning of the U.S. international trade deficit also clouds any upbeat dollar scenario. Surging imports, including costlier foreign oil, widened the trade gap 42.6 percent to $11.68 billion, its highest in over eight years.</p>
<p>"If the trade number (wasn't) so dramatic, I would say people wouldn't pay much attention to it, but it's quite a dramatic number," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs and Co.</p>
<p>"Looking at it from this side of the Pacific, I would say the sentiment in favor of a stronger dollar diminishes if the trade imbalance stays as large as it is," Hormats said.</p>
