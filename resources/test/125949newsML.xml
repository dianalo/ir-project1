<p>The U.S. National Governors' Association issued a fuel shortage alert to states this week, warning them about potential price hikes this winter, the group said Friday.</p>
<p>Citing the Energy Department, the group said a harsh winter or refinery upsets could trigger severe shortfalls.</p>
<p>"The predicted winter fuel shortages will be particularly critical in the Northeast, where residential use of heating oil is especially high, and in the Midwest, where propane is used for agricultural purposes," said NGA executive director Ray Scheppach.  </p>
<p>The association advised governors to take steps to prepare for a potential energy emergency, including readying voluntary and mandatory conservation measures and steps to ensure supplies to poor people and the elderly.</p>
<p>"Because energy prices will be higher this winter, states may need to increase Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds and review measures that protect low-income families against cut-offs in utility service," the association said.</p>
