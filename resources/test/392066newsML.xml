<p>The Cossack-Pioneer offshore oil platorm has shut down production in preparation for fleeing a tropical low off the coast of Western Australia expected to build into a cyclone, a spokeswoman for the operator, Woodside Petroleum Ltd said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The platform, which is currently producing at a reduced rate of about 65,000 barrels a day due to technical problems, halted production operations at 0700 GMT (3.00 p.m.) in preparation for disconnecting from its mooring in about three hours, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>"Production has been halted," she said.</p>
<p>"After the disconnection, it will be decided whether to leave the field."</p>
<p>A tropical low about 400 kms northwest of the coastal town of Karratha was expected to build into a cyclone as it intensified overnight, the Bureau of Meteorology said.  </p>
<p>The nearby Griffin oil field, which is capable of producing up to 80,000 bpd, but is operating below that level, was also preparing to shut down production ahead of the approaching storm, a spokesman for the operator, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd told Reuters earlier on Thursday.</p>
<p>Equal-stake partners in the North West Shelf, where the Cossack Pioneer field is situated, are units of BHP, The British Petroleum Co Plc, Japan Australia LNG (MiMi) Pty Ltd -- a partnership of Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Corp -- Chevron Corp, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Woodside Petroleum.  </p>
<p>BHP holds a 45 percent stake in the Griffin joint venture. Mobil Corp. holds 35 percent and Inpex Alpha Ltd the remaining 20 percent.</p>
