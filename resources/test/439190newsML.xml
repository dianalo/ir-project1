<p>Lithuanian bankers and dealers say they welcome the central bank's decision to begin repurchase auctions in April, saying the move will ease liquidity problems in the country's fragile banking system.</p>
<p>"The repurchase auctions will certainly help to stabilise the financial situations in the banks," said Tomas Adrejauskas, a dealer with the brokerage house Suprema.</p>
<p>"It should also kick-start the secondary treasury bill market," he added.</p>
<p>The Bank of Lithuania said the start of repo auctions in April marked the first stage in its three-part plan to scrap the country's currency board model, which effectively bars the central bank from pursuing active monetary policies.</p>
<p>Under the currency board regime, in place since April 1994, the central bank guarantees that it will have one dollar in reserve for every four litas in circulation, freezing the exchange rate at that level.</p>
<p>"This model has no flexibility," Gintas Nauseda, the head of the Bank of Lithuania's policy department, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The central bank is only the lender of last resort under the system and cannot assist solvent banks with temporary liquidity problems," he said.</p>
<p>"The repo auctions will allow us to do this and to absorb excess liquidity in the system," he said.</p>
<p>"There are sometimes liquidity surpluses in the system and sometimes liquidity deficits," he said.</p>
<p>"The repo auctions should also help to revive the inter-bank market by showing the commercial banks what the liquidity situation is...they don't have much trust in each other now," he added.</p>
<p>Lithuania's inter-bank market has fallen sharply since a crisis erupted in the sector in late 1995.</p>
<p>Inter-bank loans in January were only 15 million litas, well down from a high of 225 million litas in March 1995.</p>
<p>"The primary T-bill auctions have acted as a sort of substitute for the inter-bank market," says Raimondas Kutra, the deputy chairman of the board of leading Lithuanian bank Vilniaus Bank.</p>
<p>"The repos may help the inter-bank market and they will certainly stabilise yields at the primary auctions," he said.</p>
<p>Nauseda said the central bank was still undecided about how often it would hold repo auctions.</p>
<p>"We are analysing the needs of the commercial banks and the market to see how often these auctions should take place," he said.</p>
<p>"At first, they will probably take place once a month," he said.</p>
