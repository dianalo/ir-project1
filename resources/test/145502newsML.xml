<p>Tokyo stocks fell for the fifth straight session on Friday, leaving the market four percent lower than a week ago, as political and economic uncertainty sent investors scurrying to the sidelines.</p>
<p>The share market has been in a tailspin since last Sunday's general election failed to produce a clear mandate for Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's pro-business Liberal Democrats, to the disappointment of some stockwatchers.</p>
<p>Hopes that the market would finally snap the losing streak on Friday went unrealised.</p>
<p>"There were fervent hopes for a rebound in the Nikkei average but the index showed no signs of regaining its feet," said Harushige Kobayashi, deputy general manager at Yamaichi Securities. "Investors were really reluctant to buy ahead of the weekend, especially with the new government still shaky."</p>
<p>The key Nikkei average of 225 selected stocks shed 263.52 points, or 1.25 percent, to end at 20,739.97, closing below the key 21,000 threshold for the first time in two weeks.</p>
<p>Over the week, the benchmark's losses ballooned to more than 870 points. The last five-session losing streak was in July, when the index shed about 600 points.</p>
<p>Brokers said rounds of arbitrage-linked selling were also inspired by falls in U.S. markets overnight.</p>
<p>On Thursday on Wall Street, the Dow slid below the 6,000 level, closing 44 points lower at about 5,992.</p>
<p>Arbitrageurs simultaneously trade stocks and their underlying futures, and profit from momentary discrepancies between the prices of the two instruments.</p>
<p>"There was some domestic investor buying today, but most of it was overwhelmed by foreign investor selling, futures-linked selling and dealers squaring longs created last week ahead of the elections," said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>Before the election, investors and dealers snapped up shares, hiking the Nikkei average by more than 640 points, confident the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) stood a good chance of clinching an overall majority.</p>
<p>But the party, the dominant partner in the outgoing coalition, fell 12 seats short of a Lower House majority.</p>
<p>After initial selling, the thought of a wobbly coalition framework and economic policy limbo froze investors, brokers said, forcing them to the sidelines for most of the week.</p>
<p>Worries over the economy emerged after weak data this week, showing that the diffusion index for leading economic indicators fell below the the so-called boom-or-bust 50 mark in August for the first time since March.</p>
<p>Brokers added that the collapse of financing company Nichiei Finance Co Ltd earlier this week, the largest insolvency case in Japan in the post-war period, also did its share in dampening activity.</p>
<p>But despite the subdued, sell-dominant market atmosphere, brokers said a free-fall was unlikely as technical charts were ringing alarm bells about the index being oversold.</p>
<p>With the November trading month nearing, traders added they would have fresh funds to work with, and buying should pick up in tandem with the eventual formation of a new government.</p>
<p>Some brokers said that with the earnings season coming up, investors were scrutinising half-year earnings results and forecasts, looking for issues to buy or sell.</p>
<p>"The mood is so weak the market is reacting more sharply to firms expecting to falter, rather than to those which are seen improving," Yamaichi's Kobayashi said. "Once the market hits a correction phase, it may be able to appreciate good news more.</p>
