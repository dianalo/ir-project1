<p>President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo denied on Tuesday Rwanda had planned and led the war that brought him to power and said he had summoned Rwanda's strongman Paul Kagame over the remarks.</p>
<p>In his first interview with foreign media since he took power, Kabila told Reuters' Africa Journal Kagame had denied to him that he asserted Rwandan involvement in an interview with the Washington Post.</p>
<p>In the interview published two weeks ago, Kagame, Rwanda's vice-president and defence minister, said Rwanda had provided training and arms for Kabila's rebel forces even before the push to overthrow president Mobutu Sese Seko began last October.</p>
<p>Kagame was quoted by the Washington Post as saying Rwandan "mid-level commanders" led the rebellion, adding "it would have been more suitable...but riskier" if Congolese rebels had done "Last night Mr Kagame called me and said what was published in the Washington Post is not what he had said so I don't really know what he did say but he must come and explain to me," Kabila said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"But The Washington Post is sometimes known to misquote people and talk about a town for example in Uganda that they claim is in Congo and sometimes they plant refugee camps where there are none," he added.</p>
<p>Kabila, whose forces seized power in the former Zaire in May after a seven-month military campaign, said a few Rwandan military experts helped to train and provide technical support.</p>
<p>"There were no Burundian soldiers, no Ugandan soldiers. Yes we had Rwandan advisers to train and provide technical support but that was it," said Kabila in the capital Kinshasa.</p>
<p>"But at the same time there were French, Serbian and other foreign forces were actively recruited on the other side. Why don't they talk about that. Why just us?"</p>
<p>"Kagame's account suggests that the war which began in the eastern Congo near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda was planned primarily by Rwanda and that the plan to remove Mobutu originated in Kigali as well," the Washington Post had said.</p>
<p>Kagame was also quoted as saying his forces took part in the capture of at least four Congolese cities -- the capital Kinshasa, the southern copper-mining town of Lubumbashi, the key western crossroads of Kenge and the diamond centre of Kisangani.</p>
<p>In Tuesday's interview, Kabila denied the United Nations was having difficulties carrying out a probe into alleged massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees by his troops during the war against Mobutu.</p>
<p>"The U.N. knows very well that we are very cooperative. We don't know where those wrong statements come from but they must be from politicians of the former regime," Kabila said.</p>
<p>He added: "We invite the U.N. to come and see for themselves but they must be responsible individuals who are neutral."</p>
<p>A U.N. investigation team this month was unable to check the massacre reports on the ground after Kinshasa objected to it being led by human rights investigator Roberto Garreton of Chile.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to name a new team to head to Kinshasa shortly. Garreton, in a report earlier this month, said he had received information on 134 incidents of massacres of Rwandan refugees by Kabila's rebel forces.</p>
<p>More than a million Hutus fled Rwanda in 1994 to escape blame for a genocide there. Most returned when Kabila's revolt began in eastern Zaire last October, but hundreds of thousands instead fled farther west.</p>
<p>Since then there have been repeated reports of massacres of refugees by the rebels.</p>
<p>Kinshasa and Kigali have denied massacres of refugees by Kabila's rebels or their foreign allies have taken place. But until the Kagame interview quoted by the Washington Post the two governments had also denied any Rwandan role in the rebellion.</p>
