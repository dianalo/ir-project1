<p>Chile will formally join Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay as an associate member of the Southern Cone free-trade bloc (Mercosur) as of October 1, the Chilean foreign minister said Monday.</p>
<p>"We're joining Mercosur as an associate member ... We're joining the free trade zone, not the entire common market," Jose Miguel Insulza told Reuters in New York.  </p>
<p>In practical terms, Insulza said the Chilean government has made a commitment to to cut tariffs on about 70 percent of the goods traded between Chile and the four-nation group.</p>
<p>A 40 percent reduction of tariffs applying to those goods will take effect Tuesday. The cuts will affect mostly manufactured goods, agro-industrial products, copper and textiles, the Chilean official.</p>
<p>"The rest (of the tariffs cuts) will join later, and then in eight to 10 years we will have a free-trade zone, a completely free-trade zone," Insulza said.  </p>
<p>The Chilean foreign minister said he expected the agreement would boost the country's annual trade with the other members of the Mercosur.</p>
<p>"We now have $4.0 billion (in trade), but we expect it grow," Insulza said, without saying by how much he expected it to expand.</p>
<p>"We also expect to close the $600 million (trade) gap we have with them (the Mercosur countries), which is mainly with Argentina," the minister said.</p>
<p>To be sure, the trade deficit was likely to widen before it narrowed, Insulza said.</p>
<p>"Now we're importing most of our oil from Argentina, and next year we'll have a gas pipeline ... and we're going to important most of our gas from Argentina," he said.</p>
<p>Insulza said he expected the Chilean economy to grow about 6.0 percent this year, down from 6.9 percent growth in gross domestic product in 1995.</p>
<p>"We had to put the brakes on the economy ... because of some problems of inflation," Insulza said.</p>
<p>The minister also forecast foreign direct investment in Chile this year at $2.5 billion, little changed from last year.</p>
