<p>European Commission and U.S. agricultural officials pursued technical talks on Wednesday on grain subsidies, genetically modified maize and other farm issues with neither side disclosing details.</p>
<p>"Intensive talks were held yesterday afternoon," a Commission agricultural official said.</p>
<p>A U.S. official said there were no current plans for a press briefing.</p>
<p>Commission Director General for Agriculture, Guy Legras, discussed a wide range of issues with Paul Drazek, senior trade adviser to U.S. Agriculture Secretary, Dan Glickman.</p>
<p>The Commission official gave no details, saying discussions were continuing at a lower level.</p>
<p>The U.S. is concerned that the EU's resumption last month of wheat export subsidies could start a slide towards a renewed grain subsidy war as world prices continue to fall under the pressure of much bigger harvests this year.</p>
<p>The U.S. has warned that it will fight subsidies with subsidies if necessary.</p>
<p>Washington is also pressing Brussels to speed up approval of genetically-modified maize before the U.S. crop is harvested.</p>
<p>The maize, produced by the Swiss company Ciba-Geigy and resistant to the corn borer pest, has been attacked by European environmental and consumer groups and referred to EU scientific committees on foodstuffs, pesticides and animal nutrition.</p>
<p>The committees are not expected to give their advice until December, a Commission environment official said, adding that other genetically-modified maize and soybean varieties still had to be examined.</p>
<p>The EU earlier this year approved the use of Monsanto's Roundup Ready herebicide resistant soybeans.</p>
<p>Glickman has said the biotech maize was safe and that European objections were based on "unsound science."  He warned that maize could become a transatlantic trade issue.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said that demands for special labelling were impractical given the huge volume of exported maize.</p>
<p>U.S. maize exports to the EU were worth $530 million in 1995/96 (July/June) when prices were exceptionally high.</p>
<p>Industry sources say tests exist for identifying modified and unmodified maize and soybeans but these would result in extra costs.</p>
