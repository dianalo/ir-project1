<p>Britain's new Labour government signalled on Tuesday it would oppose any moves to bring defence under the wing of the European Union, saying NATO must remain the bedrock of the West's security.</p>
<p>Echoing the views of the previous Conservative administration, Foreign Minister Robin Cook and Defence Minister George Robertson told a meeting of the Western European Union (WEU) defence must remain an inter-governmental issue.</p>
<p>"We do not see the European Union becoming a defence organisation, such a development would undermine NATO," Cook told reporters.</p>
<p>But the two men, attending their first international gathering as ministers, used the occasion to underline they wanted a new constructive approach towards Europe and said they foresaw scope for close cooperation between the EU and WEU.</p>
<p>"We are looking for partnership, not a takeover," Cook added, saying the WEU could be used for certain humanitarian missions.</p>
<p>France and Germany had proposed merging the WEU, the EU's designated defence arm, into the European Union as part of plans to try and create a common foreign and security policy. Those proposals will be debated at a special EU summit this summer.</p>
<p>The WEU consists of 10 EU members -- France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. A further 18 countries are linked through partnership and association agreements.</p>
<p>Britain's previous Conservative government strongly opposed moves towards European integration, but favoured close military ties with other countries through the WEU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).</p>
<p>Independent analysts say there is virtually no difference between the positions of the old and new governments in London, but said the more co-operative style of the incoming Labour administration was welcomed by Britain's European allies.</p>
<p>As if to mark the different approach, Robin Cook began his intervention with a joke, saying in politics as in military matters it was an advantage to have a big majority -- a reference to Labour's May 1 election landslide.</p>
<p>Austria's Defence Minister Werner Fasslabend said Britain clearly wanted to end its isolation in Europe and play a "more constructive role".</p>
<p>"The way they presented their views was very credible," he told reporters.</p>
<p>The routine meeting of the WEU examined ways to try to create a more distinct European role within NATO.</p>
<p>Robertson said the WEU had a role as a pivot between the WEU and NATO and was the best way to use scarce resources without duplicating them.</p>
<p>"There is no need for Europe to create new institutions," he said, adding NATO had a track record in the security field.</p>
<p>Under a complex deal, the WEU is to be allowed to use certain NATO equipment for limited European-only operations.</p>
<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said her country, which is a full NATO member but only an associated member of the WEU as it is not in the European Union, would be allowed to take a full part in any WEU operation.</p>
<p>Ankara had previously threatened to block any transfer of NATO material to the WEU if Greece did not agree to its full participation.</p>
<p>The meeting began with a discussion on the crisis in Albania with several speakers regretting the WEU had not been used as the organisation for the launching of a multi-national force, led by Italy, to the chaotic Balkan country.</p>
<p>"I cannot but regret the fact that Operation Alba was undertaken outside the institutional framework of the WEU. Coalitions of the willing should not become the norm for European military operations," WEU secretary-general Jose Cutileiro said in his opening address.</p>
<p>The ministers agreed to set up a military committee within the WEU, similar to one at NATO, to plan the technical side of any WEU operation.</p>
