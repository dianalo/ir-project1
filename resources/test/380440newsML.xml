<p>Precious metals prices were steady on Friday but dealers were preparing for a further reaction to the sharp upward correction which shook the markets earlier in this week.</p>
<p>Several were bullish for silver but the short term outlook for gold, platinum and palladium was less unanimous, according to dealer comments.</p>
<p>"The accusing finger is pointing at gold. It is no where near out of its bear market yet," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Even so gold fixed at $342.50, just 15 cents off the previous fix. It closed on Thursday at $341.60/$342.10.</p>
<p>Silver appeared to have shaken itself free of gold's bearish tone, witness the declining gold-silver ratio which was around 67 on Thursday against 76 at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>"The big question mark today is the expiry of the Comex options," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Big positions were out on the $5.00 puts but open interest was even heavier on the March $5.25 calls, dealers said.</p>
<p>"A close on silver anywhere around $5.20 today could be very interesting," a dealer said. "They could go for the calls which has happened before ahead of a U.S holday," he added.</p>
<p>Comex silver is closing at 1305 EST (1805 GMT) today ahead of the President's Day holiday on Monday.</p>
<p>The option expiry will remain at the usual time of 1930 GMT, dealers said.</p>
<p>Silver was indicated at $5.15/$5.17 up two cents.</p>
<p>Gold attracted some buying from Swiss dealers on Friday morning but dealers said it had to get through $347/$348 to show that it was a "buy" again.</p>
<p>"The funds are still in a bind," a dealer said.</p>
<p>"They have taken some profits from their short positions but if the price falls, they will re-establish shorts," he said.</p>
<p>There was no market impact from a Belgian central bank governor comment that no further gold sales were planned.</p>
<p>Platinum and palladium were both steady but the announcement Russia and Japan will start export contracts talks next month could impact prices, some dealers said.</p>
<p>"It might take time for the specs to realise what has happened," one platinum group metals dealer said.</p>
<p>But another said both metals "had been an accident waiting to happen" on the upside given their fundamental strength.</p>
<p>Platinum was at $366.25/$367.25 down $0.25 and palladium at $136.50/$137.50 down $0.50. --Brian Spoors London Newsroom +44 171 542 8058</p>
