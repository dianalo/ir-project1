<title>GERMANY: German share market takes wait-and-see stance.</title>
<headline>German share market takes wait-and-see stance.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-01-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Caution prevailed on the German share market on Monday, as dealers looked to U.S. data for the next clue on inflation trends, but bank stocks continued to lead a minor advance.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX index edged higher after the close of floor trade and was at 3,00.97 points, up 18.34 points, at 1359 GMT.</p>
<p>Dealers had expected the market to touch off the magic 3,000 point level but did not see prices sustaining that level, barring an upsurge on Wall Street.</p>
<p>"The general environment is really pointing to a consolidation," said a Frankfurt dealer.  </p>
<p>"The German equity market now also appears to be changing down several gears," said Trinkaus Capital Management in a market commentary.</p>
<p>Negative factors for shares included higher than expected inflation in January, an apparent end to Wall Street's boom and a downward trend for Japanese equities.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Trinkaus said the weak deutsche mark and benefits from Germany's planned tax reform would trigger earnings forecast upgrades for German firms in coming weeks.</p>
<p>"We accordingly consider that the German equity market will encounter strong support between 2,900 and 2,950 DAX points."  </p>
<p>Buying was selective with bank stocks remaining the favourites of the day.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG was up 1.37 marks at 85.38 marks while Commerzbank AG was up 31 pfennigs at 43.91.</p>
<p>Commerzbank is to reveal its 1996 dividend tomorrow and Deutsche's supervisory board meets tomorrow, an event normally followed by a dividend announcement.</p>
<p>Most analysts said they expect Commerzbank to recommend an unchanged 1.35 mark dividend and use its expected earnings gains for the year to beef up reserves, possibly in preparation for buying an asset manager.  </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank is expected to report a stagnation in 1996 net profit at the 1995 level of 2.1 billion marks due in part to the 200 million-pound cost of compensating investors for mismanagement of three MGAM unit trusts in 1995.</p>
<p>However analysts remain for the most part bullish on the bank, and rate its efforts to beef up its investment banking activities positively.</p>
<p>Siemens AG was also trading heavily, and was up 1.63 marks at 78.50 marks, partly rebounding from last week, but also ahead of a first quarter earnings report Tuesday.</p>
