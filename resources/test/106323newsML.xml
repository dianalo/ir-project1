<p>Spanish Economy Minister Rodrigo Rato said on Wednesday that international confidence in the nation's ability to join in Europe's common currency project was rising.</p>
<p>"Confidence in the Spanish economy's convergence ability has risen considerably in recent months and undoubtedly the government's liberalisation measures, such as checks on public spending and guaranties on the fulfillment of the public deficit in 1996 and, above all, the presentation of an austere deficit are helping us from the market's point of view," RAto said in response to a legislative question.</p>
<p>As evidence, Rato pointed to the Spanish bond spread with its German counterpart which has narrowed to 161 basis points Wednesday afternoon from 330 on March 1.</p>
