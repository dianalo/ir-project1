<p>Ringgit continued to accumulate losses in late Asian trading on fresh selling by funds and the strong dollar/majors, dealers said on Monday.</p>
<p>They said many who had place dollar sell orders on Friday night were seen covering their positions as the strong dollar/majors swamped the market early on Monday.</p>
<p>"A lot of people who had initiated shorts were buying back dollars," the head of foreign exchange dealing at a Malaysian bank said.</p>
<p>He said there was some dollar selling by corporates and Japanese funds, but that was absorbed by the market.  </p>
<p>A Singapore-based U.S. bank dealer said the market was unlikely to move sharply in London as players were cautious ahead of Malaysia's February trade data release on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Unless it is way out of expectations, the ringgit should trade in a wide range," he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said if 2.5150 a dollar level was broken, dollar/ringgit could head for 2.5180 or even 2.52.</p>
<p>At 1000 GMT, the ringgit was at 2.5136/46 to a dollar.</p>
