<p>A senior Air Force official said Monday it was unlikely that a female pilot scheduled to be court-martialed on charges of adultery will be granted an honourable discharge, but her lawyer was optimistic a judge would delay the trial while her resignation bid is considered.</p>
<p>"It is going to be very, very unlikely that the secretary will allow an honourable discharge," the official in Washington told Reuters when asked if 1st Lt. Kelly Flinn's request would be granted.</p>
<p>Flinn, the Air Force's first female B-52 pilot, is seeking to resign with an honourable discharge to avoid court-martial on adultery and other charges. The trial was scheduled to begin Tuesday at the base.</p>
<p>Her civilian lawyer Frank Spinner told a news conference shortly after he submitted her request for an honourable discharge to Minot Air Force Base officials that he was "optimistic ... that the judge will grant us some time."</p>
<p>"It is going to be very, very unlikely that the secretary will allow an honourable discharge," the Air Force official told Reuters in Washington when asked if Flinn's request for the honourable discharge would be granted.</p>
<p>But the official, who asked not to be identified, said the Air Force Judge Advocate General's office at the Pentagon was likely to grant a delay in the court-martial on Tuesday morning, pending a decision by Widnall on Flinn's request.</p>
<p>Spinner said "the whole point of Lt. Flinn offering this resignation is to avoid a trial, to avoid the embarrassment that we believe it will bring on the Air Force as well as further embarrassment it will cause her."</p>
<p>He also said he was seeking to delay the trial until June 2 to gain more time to prepare for the court-martial.</p>
<p>Flinn's lawyers submitted the resignation request -- a thick, bound document that Spinner showed to reporters -- to the office of Col. Robert Elder, the 5th Bomb Wing commander at Minot Air Force Base. Her lawyers confirmed that they had sent another copy via overnight mail to Widnall in Washington.</p>
<p>Spinner said the document argued that an honourable discharge would not be an unreasonable outcome to Flinn's case. He said he had identified "numerous cases" in which Air Force members in similar circumstances had been allowed to remain on active duty.</p>
<p>"Our position is that it is not rare for someone who is charged with adultery even to remain on active duty or to receive an honourable discharge," Spinner said. "This is not precedent-setting if Lt. Flinn receives an honourable discharge."</p>
<p>Flinn, 26 and single, has acknowledged having had an affair with a married civilian and was also accused of having sex with a lower-ranking enlisted man. She also faced several other military charges, including being accused of lying.</p>
<p>Spinner acknowledged there was a possibility that the judge in the case, Col. Dennis Kansala, would deny the delay and that the trial would go forward Tuesday.</p>
<p>"One option would be to process the resignation request and (for) the trial to go forward. Even if there's a conviction, the secretary could still approve the request and that would eliminate the conviction," Spinner said.</p>
<p>The Air Force said in a statement that Col. Elder had received Flinn's request.</p>
<p>"Col. Elder will review the request and act on it in accordance with Air Force regulations," the statement said. "He has not had time to properly evaluate the request to ensure Lt. Flinn receives due process."</p>
<p>It was unclear how quickly the Air Force chain of command could process Flinn's request, but the decision on whether to grant the honourable discharge will likely fall to Widnall.</p>
<p>Flinn has said she would rather go to trial than accept a less-than-honourable discharge, which Spinner said would preclude her from flying military planes for the National Guard.</p>
<p>Conviction of adultery in a military trial is punishable by penalties ranging up to dishonourable discharge and possible fines and imprisonment. Critics have argued that Flinn's case highlights a double standard in the way the U.S. Armed Forces treats the issue of adultery among its male and female staff.</p>
