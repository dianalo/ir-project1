<p>Williams Specialty Steel Inc will build a major plant in New Haven, Conn., Mayor John DeStefano, Jr. said Thursday.</p>
<p>Total investment in the new plant was not immediately known.</p>
<p>DeStefano said Williams Specialty was relocating from Buffalo, N.Y., to a 25-acre industrial site in the northeast corner of New Haven.</p>
<p>The project will create 3,000 construction jobs and 350 new permanent jobs, the mayor said.  </p>
<p>When in full production, the company will produce more than 15 percent of the world's stainless steel, DeStefano said.</p>
<p>Williams Specialty makes continuous cast slabs for the stainless flat rolled industry.</p>
<p>The plant will occupy a new, 250,000-square-foot facility.</p>
<p>New Haven will issue tax increment bonds by pledging the new, incremental real estate taxes only generated from the project and using the funds to pay debt service associated with the new plant, DeStefano said.  </p>
<p>DeStefano said the company chose to move from Buffalo because of New Haven's skilled work force and transportation assets.</p>
<p>The company will ship domestic steel by rail and its European products by ship from New Haven harbor.</p>
