<p>Apple Computer Inc chairman Gilbert Amelio put on a brave face for his Japanese audience on Wednesday, brushing off "swirling changes" and saying 1997 will be the most exciting new product year ever for the company.</p>
<p>"1997 will be the most exciting new product year ever," the Apple chairman said in his keynote speech delivered at the opening of Macworld Expo being held near Tokyo.</p>
<p>"I firmly belive, despite the changes swirling around us, Apple"s strengths and values remain fundamentally sound and they align directly with major industry trends," Amelio said.</p>
<p>But back home, Apple"s poor business performance has triggered a series of high-level departures from the troubled computer maker, with the latest, executive vice-president Marco Landi, announcing his resignation on Tuesday.</p>
<p>With Landi"s departure, none of Apple"s senior executives have more than one year"s experience at the company.</p>
<p>Amelio, himself at the helm for only a year, made no comment on Landi"s departure.</p>
<p>Landi was one of the few remaining Apple executives who worked under former chief executive Michael Spindler, who was replaced by Amelio after Apple"s market share fell sharply and losses continued to mount.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Amelio said that the company will reduce costs by $400 million per year through its latest restructuring efforts, the details of which would be announced next month.</p>
<p>Apple, once the darling of the computer industry,  recently said it does not expect to return to profitability until at least the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, if not later.</p>
<p>Apple stunned Wall Street with a $120 million loss in the the first quarter of its 1997 business year, due to falling sales of its flagship Macintosh line.</p>
<p>Since then, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company has outlined a restructuring plan -- the second in 12 months -- that will involve layoffs to return it to profit.</p>
<p>Amelio is in Japan this week to unveil Apple"s new product lines, including the new PowerBook 3400 notebook computers, the updated Power Macintosh desktop computers and a new digital camera.</p>
<p>He said the Apple was committed to provide products specifically designed for the Japanese market, which accounts for roughly 25 percent of Apple"s global sales.</p>
<p>"Your standards are very high and we challenge ourselves to meet them," he said.</p>
