<p>Tandy Corp., responding to stiff competition and sluggish consumer demand, said Monday that it was selling its chain of Incredible Universe computer stores and closing almost a fifth of its Computer City stores in North America.</p>
<p>Tandy, one of the nation's largest retailers of consumer electronics best known for its Radio Shack stores, said it would take a $170 million charge in the current quarter for the downsizing, which comes amid a slump in sales of personal computers to consumers.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the sales were not disclosed.</p>
<p>While Tandy has continued to expand its 6,800-store Radio Shack retailing business through joint ventures, its Incredible Universe and Computer City operations have struggled in the face of stiff competition and sluggish consumer demand.</p>
<p>The company, based in Fort Worth, Texas, said earlier this month that it would take an after-tax charge of more than $20 million to discontinue its 53 McDuff electronics stores in Texas and the Southeast.</p>
<p>Tandy said it was selling its 17-store Incredible Universe chain, closing 19 Computer City stores in North America and relocating two others. The company has 108 Computer City stores in North America.</p>
<p>It said the phase-out of the Incredible Universe chain will take about six months.</p>
<p>"The Incredible Universe concept was developed to provide a larger selection, non-commissioned sales environment, and a 'hands-on' experience," Chairman John Roach said in a statement.</p>
<p>"While individual stores enjoyed success and customers surveyed had strong positives for Incredible Universe, the economic model is not viable for Tandy."</p>
<p>The company said eight of the 19 Computer City stores to be shut are in California, seven in the Los Angeles area, and three are in Washington, D.C.  Two others are in the Baltimore area, with one each in Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The two stores to be relocated are in Atlanta and Chicago, it added.</p>
<p>Tandy said it already had contracted to sell six Incredible Universe stores to Fry's Electronics Inc., a privately held computers and electronics retailer based in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
<p>In addition, Tandy said, the buildings and land occupied by those stores will be sold to limited partnerships which will lease the stores to Fry's.</p>
<p>Tandy's stock rose $1 to $46.50 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
