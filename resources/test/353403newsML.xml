<p>German soccer chiefs attacked England on Tuesday for not consulting them before the country decided on a rival European bid for the 2006 World Cup finals.</p>
<p>The German soccer federation (DFB), caught up in a row which also involves England and Europe's governing body UEFA over bidding for the event, said it had announced back in 1993 that it would try to get the finals.</p>
<p>It feels the English Football Association (F.A.) should have told Germany of its intentions before it expressed interest in the event much later following the country's successful hosting of last year's European championship.</p>
<p>"You have to ask the question whether a country should go to a partner and tell them rather than let them be informed through the media," DFB spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach said.</p>
<p>"It is normal that countries should talk to each other. I told (F.A. official) David Davies that we are not happy that things started like this. It shouldn't happen like that.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is forgotten but (DFB chief) Egidius Braun was a huge supporter of England to get Euro 96 at times when some people were saying the event can't go to England because of the hooligans."</p>
<p>Last Friday UEFA announced it would be backing the Germans' campaign, setting off outrage in British sporting and political circles. The F.A. called the decision undemocratic.</p>
<p>But the Germans believe Europe can fend off competition from Africa and South America to get the tournament only if the continent speaks with one voice.</p>
<p>They are desperate to avoid the kind of costly squabbling which marred the contest for the 2002 tournament between Asian rivals Japan and South Korea.</p>
<p>The event was eventually awarded jointly to the two bitter rivals -- a development which the Germans say is out of the question in this case.</p>
<p>The F.A., whose argument is largely with UEFA, has also attempted to build bridges with the DFB.</p>
<p>"We have received a fax from (F.A chief executive Graham) Kelly saying that the argument is not with the Germans and we want to stay good friends and colleagues," Niersbach said.</p>
<p>"There have been no dirty tricks on our part in all this. We have always put our cards firmly on the table."</p>
<p>Germany plans to put Franz Becemnauer, the most successful figure in its footballing history, at the top of its bid.</p>
<p>The former World Cup-winning captain and coach has agreed to take on the same kind of leading role which France gave to its former leading light Michel Platini in its successful bid for the 1998 finals.</p>
<p>The DFB wants to avoid using taxpayers' money during the bidding process but millions of dollars will be pumped into rebuilding the country's stadia if it wins.</p>
<p>There are already plans to spend around $60 million rebuilding Munich's Olympic stadium which staged the final the last time the country held the tournament in 1974. The Germans plan to put a new roof over the whole of the stadium.</p>
