<p>Lithuanian shares advanced by the close on Tuesday, as official list banking shares maintained their dominance.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was some optimism that the rise in the market, coming after a prolonged slump, may continue.</p>
<p>The official list index advanced 11.83 points to 943.92 points and the broader group A edged up 3.04 points to 1857.61.</p>
<p>"A slight trend for an increase should remain until the end of the week, with mainly official list shares going up," said one broker.</p>
<p>The central market traded 853,000 litas versus 539,000 litas on Monday, while turnover in block trades was 3.1 million litas versus 3.4 million litas.</p>
<p>Official list favourites Hermis Bank and Vilniaus Bank remained dominant in central market trade.</p>
<p>Hermis shares were stable at 210 litas and turned over 339,000 litas on the central market and 1.7 million litas traded in block transactions at 170.10 litas.</p>
<p>Vilniaus Bank advanced to 243.20 litas from 240 litas on the central market amid 138,000 litas turnover.</p>
<p>The move came after it said on Monday that its profit for the first six months was 21.4 million litas.</p>
<p>Dealers say that Hermis shares still have more room to grow than Vilniaus Bank's. Hermis said last week its first-half profit was 14.3 million.</p>
<p>"It's cheap compared to Vilniaus Bank and the results were good," said one dealer.</p>
<p>Lithuanian Sea Shipping Company stood out on the group A list as it sunk to 5.29 litas from 5.87 litas in fairly quiet central market turnover of about 11,000 litas.</p>
<p>"I think the price should return to its normal level, 5.80 litas to 5.90 litas, or at least to 5.70 litas tomorrow," one broker said. "I think technical reasons brought the price down."</p>
