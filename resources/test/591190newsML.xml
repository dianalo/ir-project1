<p>Israeli President Ezer Weizman was quoted by an Israeli newspaper on Friday as saying he had cut off contact with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his attitude towards a peacemaking crisis with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>"I have cut all contact with him. Bibi isn't ready to listen. He knows everything," the daily Yedioth Ahronoth quoted Weizman, using Netanyahu's nickname, as saying.</p>
<p>"When I returned from the meeting with (Palestinian President Yasser) Arafat, I thought he would want to hear what happened there. Not at all."</p>
<p>Netanyahu's spokesman, Shai Bazak, said of the report: "As far as I know that isn't true." Weizman's spokesman was not available to comment.</p>
<p>Weizman, whose post is largely ceremonial, is well-known in Israel for bluntness. He met Arafat 10 days ago in an effort to overcome a two-month impasse in Israel-PLO peace talks.</p>
<p>On May 12, Weizman told Israel Television: "I see myself as the icebreaker. I opened the channel and the convoy needed to follow it...but the convoy did not follow it."</p>
<p>"More desire is needed, a lot more desire and a lot more understanding. I opened the channel, I hope. Anyone who wants can travel down it...."</p>
<p>Peacemaking ground to a halt when Netanyahu ordered work to begin on a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem on March 18.</p>
<p>Netanyahu this week said he was proud of the decision to build the 6,500-unit settlement.</p>
<p>Israel insists the eastern part of the city it captured from Jordan in 1967 will remain its eternal, united capital. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of a future state. They say settlement-building pre-empts final peace talks.</p>
<p>Yedioth, quoting minutes of the Weizman-Arafat meeting the newspaper said it obtained, said Weizman brought Arafat a compromise proposal from Netanyahu.</p>
<p>"You start building first, massively, at Har Homa," the newspaper quoted Weizman as saying. Israel calls the settlement site Har Homa. Palestinians call it Jabal Abu Ghneim.</p>
<p>"Prime Minister Netanyahu agrees you build between five and 10,000 houising units for young (Arab) couples from East Jerusalem, with aid and government funding from Israel."</p>
<p>Yedioth said Arafat rejected the proposal.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's spokesman denied there was such a proposal.</p>
<p>On Friday, U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross was due to leave the region after coming up empty in a bid to bring the sides back to the negotiating table.</p>
