<text>
<p>Turkey's constitutional court on Thursday annulled a law enabling the government to sell state property, setting back Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's economic plans.</p>
<p>A court official told Reuters the court had taken its decision after 113 deputies from two opposition left-wing parties applied for the law's cancellation.</p>
<p>The law, published in Turkey's official gazette on September 12, was designed to make property sales easier as part of the government's first revenue-raising package after coming to power in late June.</p>
<p>The coalition had aimed to raise 300 trillion Turkish lira from the sell-offs.</p>
