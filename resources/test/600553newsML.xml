<title>UK: Super-charged UK Treasury misfires in cyberspace.</title>

<p>Britain's Treasury Department -- enacting changes at a breakneck pace -- misfired into cyberspace on Wednesday by releasing an erroneous figure on interest rates.</p>
<p>Financial markets were puzzled, the Treasury Department was red-faced and the central bank could be forgiven for smirking at a super-charged Labour government, in power for just three weeks after 18 years in opposition and hell-bent on change.</p>
<p>Indeed, the mishap on rates came on the same day that the central bank issued its first ever warning about the dangers of conducting financial affairs on the Internet.</p>
<p>In its annual report, the Bank of England said it welcomed increased choice for customers as more institutions offer banking services on the worldwide computer network.</p>
<p>But it said cowboys may abuse the system and consumers might not always be able to tell if the institution was authorised or from where it was operating.</p>
<p>Caution was its watchword -- an word apparently not recognised by some newcomers in the finance ministry.</p>
<p>For when the Treasury released minutes on Wednesday of crucial talks between the finance minister and Bank of England governor, it muddled its numbers and had to admit the old-fashioned paper version of events was the one to be trusted, not the sleek new Internet version.</p>
<p>"The printed version shows (Bank of England Governor Eddie George) asked for a quarter point rise and that is correct," said a Treasury spokesman.</p>
<p>The Internet version had said that George favoured a half-point rise -- much to the shock of some traders since degrees of a percent can amount to millions lost or gained in the hurly-burly of world financial markets.</p>
<p>Said one embarrassed Treasury insider: "Oh no. This is terrible. I'll have to go and kick the machine."</p>
