<p>All cargo carrier, Cargolux Airlines International, said very favourable market conditions and a rising dollar pointed the way to significant ex-Europe increases in air cargo rates in the autumn.</p>
<p>"Normally, we would be looking at rises of 10 percent or just below but this time round it should be possible to go above this percentage with October one a likely date," Pierre Wesner, Cargolux' vice-president, Europe/Africa/Middle East said.</p>
<p>Cargolux, which last increased its rates from April 1 1997, will probably make a decision on the scale of its autumn rises by end-August, he told Reuters in a telehone interview.</p>
<p>"The increases will be across the board but would probably also reflect the differences between national markets,"he added.</p>
<p>"As far as we are concerned, there is strong demand everywhere at the moment which has produced a squeeze on capacity while the strengthening dollar has put pressure on costs. For example, we purchase and lease aircraft as well as aviation fuel, in dollars," Wesner said.</p>
<p>Cargolux would have been pushing for rates increases even without the rising dollar because the market was ripe for them, he added.</p>
<p>"Since August 1996, there has been no noticeable downturn in demand even during the traditionally "weak" months which is an indication of a strong, buoyant market. While there is likely to be a slight dip in August this will only mark a brief interlude with activity picking up and moving into full swing in September.</p>
<p>"One can't really pinpoint a specfic region or destination where demand is particularly strong. It's more a general trend."</p>
<p>The Luxembourg-based carrier flew 1.08 billion FTK in first half 1997, a 15 percent rise on the same period last year.</p>
<p>Wesner said the buoyant market was creating capacity problems.</p>
<p>"We are in contact with leasing operators to try and negotiate short-term agreements on additional aircraft but it's not easy, the availability of freighters being at a premium at present because of a high level of demand for them."</p>
<p>Cargolux operates a fleet of three Boeing 747-400Fs and  is to take delivery of a further two 400Fs, one at the end of next month and a second in November 1997.</p>
<p>It also operates four Boeing 747-200Fs, including one on leaseback.</p>
<p>"Frankly, we can't take delivery of the additional 400s soon enough as we could make immediate use of the extra capacity. Tomorrow would do very nicely," he said.</p>
<p>Cargolux operates a total of 44 scheduled 747F flights per week on its worldwide network encompassing Asia and the Pacific, the Near and Middle East, the U.S. and South America and South Africa as well as serving several destinations on a cargo charter basis, statistics from the airline show.</p>
<p>Wesner said he was unable to comment on the progress of talks between Lufthansa Cargo AG and Swissair for the sale of the former's 24.5 percent stake in Cargolux to SwiSssair.</p>
