<p>The defending Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys will be the best represented team at the 1997 Pro Bowl with nine players named Thursday to the National Football League's annual post-season all-star game.</p>
<p>Dallas, which holds a one-game lead in the NFC East with a 9-5 record, led the league in players selected with nine, including four starters -- guard Larry Allen, tackle Erik Williams, defensive end Tony Tolbert and cornerback Deion Sanders.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, running back Emmitt Smith was not on the list, ending a six-year string of making the Pro Bowl. Wide receiver Michael Irvin, another perennial Pro Bowl selection from the Cowboys, was also left off after missing the first five games of the season due to a drug suspension.</p>
<p>The Denver Broncos, owners of the NFL's best record at 12-2, and the surprising second-year Carolina Panthers (10-4), each had seven players selected.</p>
<p>All but one of the Broncos named were designated as starters, including future Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway and emerging star running back Terrell Davis.</p>
<p>The starting NFC quarterback will be Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers.</p>
<p>Green Bay defensive end Reggie White, the league's all-time sacks leader, and San Francisco 49ers superstar wide receiver Jerry Rice were each selected for an NFL-record 11th time, breaking the mark of 10 they had shared with Lawrence Taylor, Ronnie Lott and Mike Singletary.</p>
<p>The Panthers, who Sunday become the first NFL team ever to clinch a playoff berth in only its second year, will have four starters on the Pro Bowl team, nailing down three of the NFC's four starting linebacker slots with Kevin Greene, Lamar Lathon, and Sam Mills getting the nod.</p>
<p>The AFC backup quarterbacks selected were Drew Bledsoe of the New England Patriots and Vinny Testaverde of the Baltimore Ravens. Backing up Favre on the NFC squad are Troy Aikman of Dallas and San Francisco's Steve Young.</p>
