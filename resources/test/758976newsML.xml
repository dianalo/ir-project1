<p>New Line Cinema Corp said Monday it secured a revolving $400 million production facility through an asset-backed commercial paper conduit administered by ABN AMRO Bank NV.</p>
<p>New Line said the loan provides self sufficient production financing for New Line and Fine Line Features, and is non-recourse to corporate parent Time Warner Inc.</p>
<p>New Line expects to fund film production for the next three years, including "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," with Jim Carrey; and "The Women," with Julia Roberts and Meg Ryan.</p>
<p>"Creative independence and financial autonomy were key objectives for New Line Cinema when we joined the Time Warner family," said Michael Lynne, New Line president.  "Through this partnership with ABN AMRO, we have secured financing that meets our future production needs while providing our parent company with a unique, non-recourse funding alternative that will not burden its balance sheet."</p>
<p>Participating banks in the ABN AMRO-led transaction include Westdeutsche Landesbank, ING Barings, Sumitomo Bank Ltd, Banque Nationale de Paris, Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd, and Union Bank of Switzerland.</p>
