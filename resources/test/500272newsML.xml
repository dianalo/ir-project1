<text>
<p>The European Parliament completed on Thursday its first readings on the Commission's Auto/Oil proposals, adopting dozens of amendments to the draft directives on engine emissions and fuel quality.</p>
<p>For the fuels report, written by French Green Noel Mamere, Euro-MPs adopted amendments 1-6, 8-24, 26-51, 60-64 and the first part of amendment 53.</p>
<p>Among these was amendment 13, an additional recital saying national capitals should be allowed to use differentiated excise taxes to promote cleaner fuels, a change supported in the main legal text by amendment 27, adding article 5a.</p>
<p>Parliament also adopted amendment 26, applicable to draft article 4 of proposal COM(96)248 for a directive on petrol and diesel fuels, requiring member states to make available two grades of diesel from 2000, with the lower grade being phased out in 2005.</p>
<p>Amendments 40 to 48, concerning draft annex I on environmental standards for petrol, sought the following changes:</p>
<p>Distillation, evaporated at 100 degrees C, to 51 from 46 pct v/v;</p>
<p>Distillation, evaporated at 150 degrees C, to 80 from 75 pct v/v;</p>
<p>Olefins, to 10 from 18 pct v/v;</p>
<p>Aromatics, to 35 from 45 pct v/v - with a compulsory minimum value of 30 pct v/v by 2005;</p>
<p>Benzene, to 1 from 2 pct v/v;</p>
<p>Oxygen content, to 2.7 from 2.3 pct m/m;</p>
<p>Sulphur content, 30 parts per million (ppm) from 200 - with a compulsory minimum value of 30 ppm by 2005.</p>
<p>Amendment 49 changes the Annex II heading to Annex IIA, opening the way for Amendment 50, the most significant part of which is to cut the maximum sulphur in diesel content from 350 ppm in 2000 to 100 ppm.</p>
<p>Amendment 51 introduces the new Annex IIB, which specifies the new second grade of diesel with a maximum sulphur content of 50 ppm.</p>
<p>The report by German Socialist Bernd Lange, on air pollution by motor vehicles, contained even more amendments, most of which Euro-MPs adopted on Thursday.</p>
<p>These were 1-19, 21-34, 36-90, 92, and 93.</p>
<p>Among the more significant were amendments 26 and 27, introducing tighter in-service compliance tests for engines.</p>
<p>Another is 34, which adds a new article 3a requiring a cold-start emission test at minus seven degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Parliament also said, in amendment 39, that the European Commission should propose a draft directive no later than the end of 1998 for average fuel efficiencies for petrol and diesel-engined vehicles in 2005 and 2010.</p>
<p>Amendment 47 changes various limit values in the proposal's Annex I(5.3.1.4) as follows:</p>
<p>Mass of hydrocarbons in petrol vehicles, to 0.12g/km in 2000 from 0.2;</p>
<p>Mass of hydrocarbons in diesel vehicles, introducing a value of 0.07g/km for 2000 and 2005;</p>
<p>Mass of nitrogen oxides in diesels, to 0.4g/km from 0.5 in 2000 and to 0.19 from 0.25 in 2005;</p>
<p>Mass of particulates from diesels, to 0.04g/km from 0.05 in 2000 and to 0.02g/km from 0.025 in 2005.</p>
<p>Values for 2005 would no longer be indicative but mandatory.</p>
<p>Amendment 75 adds to Annex XI(5.1.1.) the requirement that access to on-board diagnostic systems be unrestricted and standardised.</p>
<p>Amendment 87 increased the durability requirements for vehicles' anti-pollution equipment to 120,000 kilometres or seven years, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>Parliament's amendments go far further than the likely consensus position emerging from ongoing Council of Ministers discussions, meaning there is likely to be a significant gap between the assembly's first readings and an eventual common position in Council.</p>
<p>It is this which dictates the Commission's likely frostiness to the vast majority of Thursday's amendments, a senior official told Reuters ahead of the vote but in anticipation of the outcome.</p>
<p>"We are sticking to the broad lines of our proposal," said the official, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>"Several of the amendments coming from parliament we can accept but we are sticking to our broad proposal.</p>
<p>"We are at the beginning of a long, complicated negotiating process involving the parliament and Council. Our main wish is to facilitate that process," the official said.</p>
<p>"We do recognise that parliament is going in the right direction as far as the environment is concerned but we have had major negotiations with industry and we do not feel that we can move away from our proposal too early," the official added.</p>
<p>"At the same time, we have to be very careful. If we go too far we might end up in a situation where the Council is blocked, unable to get a common position.</p>
<p>"If we accept very ambitious amendments as the picture is at the present time in Council, it's very unlikely that there would be a qualified majority for that," the official added.</p>
<p>The official added the Commission could probably accept certain minor amendments relating to fiscal incentives and to questions of guaranteed general access to vehicles' on-board diagnostic systems.</p>
<p>Thursday's vote now leaves the field to the Dutch Presidency of the Environment Council, which has pledged to get common positions on the proposals in June.</p>
<p>While the Lange and Mamere reports went through on Thursday, an important question, raised both by the Commission official and others, is how the parliament will perform when the reports return for their second reading, when rapporteurs will need to muster absolute majorities for their reports and amendments.</p>
