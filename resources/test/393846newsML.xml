<p>Guatemala's government, trying to distance itself from past military regimes, reluctantly allowed the body of a military ex-president to lay in state at the National Palace on Thursday.</p>
<p>Flags at government buildings were at the top of their masts more than 24 hours after the death of Col. Enrique Peralta Azurdia, who led a military coup in 1963 and was head of state until 1966.</p>
<p>President Alvaro Arzu made no official statement about the death of Peralta, who was in power when the army waged its first counterinsurgency campaigns against leftist rebels.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the Foreign Relations Minister told El Grafico newspaper it would be unconstitutional to allow Peralta's body to lie in state at the palace, which is the seat of government, since he had taken over the government by military force.</p>
<p>But he was apparently overruled by the military, which went ahead with plans for a funeral with full honours. By noon hundreds of soldiers from different branches of the armed forces stood in formation in front of the palace to welcome the funeral procession.</p>
<p>Peralta died of old age on Tuesday in a military hospital. He was 88.</p>
<p>He had lived in Miami since the late 1970s, after a failed bid to win the presidency through democratic means. He returned to Guatemala in January for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Guatemala's government, which signed a peace treaty with the rebels on Dec. 29 ending a 30-year civil war, has sought to erase Guatemala's international image as a land of military dictators and human rights violations.</p>
<p>Under terms of the peace agreement, the army will change drastically -- it will no longer play a role in internal security and its ranks will be cut by one-third.</p>
