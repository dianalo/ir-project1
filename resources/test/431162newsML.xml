<p>The chief Palestinian negotiator quit on Monday, angry at what President Yasser Arafat called an Israeli "trick" that had plunged peace talks into crisis.</p>
<p>Mahmoud Abbas, better known as Abu Mazen, handed Arafat his resignation in protest at Israel's decision to hand over nine percent of the West Bank instead of the 30 percent Palestinians expected.</p>
<p>Arafat, the Palestinian Authority head, said the decision violated Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu's peace promises. Other Palestinian leaders called Israel's policies a recipe for violence.</p>
<p>"There is a real crisis because there is a clear breaching to what had been agreed upon," Arafat told reporters in Gaza. He called the Israeli decision "a trick and a conspiracy against the peace process".</p>
<p>Abbas, an architect of the groundbreaking 1993 Israel-PLO peace accord, demanded in talks with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy on Sunday that Israel consult Palestinians on the scope of withdrawal.</p>
<p>The pullback from parts of the West Bank occupied by Israel since 1967 is the first of three outlined in a 1995 peace accord and reaffirmed in the Hebron deal Netanyahu signed in January.</p>
<p>Neither agreement sets the scope of the pullbacks, and Israel says a U.S. note attached to the Hebron deal left the extent of the withdrawal to its sole discretion.</p>
<p>"Abu Mazen saw that it is not possible to continue while this policy and method from the Israeli side continues and thus tendered his resignation from his post as head of the negotiating team," Ahmed Tibi, Arafat's aide, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Neither Abbas nor Arafat would discuss the resignation.</p>
<p>Arafat's media adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah said Arafat had yet to act on it.</p>
<p>The nine-percent decision followed two other actions that irked Palestinians -- cabinet approval to build another Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem and steps to shut down four PLO offices in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Palestinians say the Jewish settlement would prejudice final peace talks scheduled to start on March 17.</p>
<p>Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo warned of a possible repetition of the violence that greeted Netanyahu's opening of a tunnel in Arab East Jerusalem last September.</p>
<p>"The policy of Mr Netanyahu and his government will lead us to the abyss, will lead us to very dangerous things which we are all trying to avoid," Abed Rabbo told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>An Israeli official said Israel would not go ahead with the nine-percent pullback so long as Palestinians rejected it. Levy said he made clear to Abu Mazen that Israel would not reconsider building the settlement nor negotiate the West Bank pullback.</p>
<p>Seven legislators in Netanyahu's 68-member coalition met in parliament on Monday meanwhile to discuss ways to block the withdrawal, accusing him of violating election promises by handing over any land.</p>
<p>"The breach of trust by the prime minister against the voters is very serious and will lead to the creation of a Palestinian state," lawmaker David Re'em of Netanyahu's own Likud party told reporters.</p>
<p>"We should use this power to show the prime minister that he is worthless without his parliament members," he said. Netanyahu flew on Monday to Russia for a three-day official visit.</p>
