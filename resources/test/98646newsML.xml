<p>U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to urge him to make swift progress in talks with Palestinians resuming on Sunday to stanch an outburst of bloodshed.</p>
<p>But on the pivotal issue of Hebron, the West Bank Arab city long scheduled for an Israeli troop redeployment, Netanyahu refused to commit to a deadline, telling his Likud party faction earlier in the day: "There is no target date".</p>
<p>Christopher was later due to meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat before the scheduled start of talks between teams of lower-level negotiators on the Israeli side of the border with the self-ruled Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Christopher said he would stress to both leaders "the importance of significant progress, the urgency of it and especially a reminder of their commitment that they would become personally involved if progress wasn't made".</p>
<p>The continuous talks at the Erez crossing were the outcome of last week's emergency White House summit spurred by clashes and gunbattles that claimed the lives of 58 Palestinians and 15 Israelis.</p>
<p>The Gaza talks, with the participation of Christopher's Middle East envoy Dennis Ross, centre on the partial Israeli pullback from Hebron delayed since March by Islamic suicide bombings in Israel and by Israeli security concerns.</p>
<p>Hebron, holy to Moslems and Jews as the traditional burial place of the biblical Abraham, is the only one of seven West Bank towns in a 1995 peace deal yet to be given Palestinian self-rule -- and the only one where Jews live among Arabs.</p>
<p>It remained to be seen how the two sides would reconcile differences over Hebron and other issues such as demands by Israel for tougher security arrangements and by Palestinians for easing of restrictions.</p>
<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on Sunday Israel's insistence on renegotiating issues it had agreed upon with Palestinians was dangerous and could throw the region into catastrophe.</p>
<p>Arafat said that "the most important thing is how we are going to push forward the implementation of the agreements".</p>
<p>"We do not accept any modifications to agreements even if that modification was adding commas or periods," said Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas, better known as Abu Mazen. "I do not expect a breakthrough in tonight's meeting," he said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said he expected negotiations on substance would only begin on Monday. Israel Radio, quoting Palestinian negotiators, said the talks would be closed to the media from Monday and alternate daily between the two sides of the border.</p>
<p>It was largely quiet on Sunday in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel said it lifted an 11-day-old curfew on Hebron on Sunday. Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he hoped to further lower tensions, ordering that some tanks pull back from the outskirts of Palestinian towns and cities.</p>
<p>Netanyahu views Israeli-PLO peace accords as fundamentally flawed but promises to see the Hebron redeployment through as an international commitment.</p>
<p>His top adviser Dore Gold told Israel Radio that although Israel did not commit to a deadline on Hebron, Netanyahu and his team made clear in Washington that they wanted to complete the negotiations "as quickly as possible".</p>
<p>Gold said Israel viewed the United States as a "facilitator" helping the negotiators without taking their place.</p>
<p>The Palestinians -- and the United States -- have demanded a deadline for the pullback.</p>
<p>Fifty-eight Palestinians and 15 Israelis died in violence that erupted after Netanyahu opened a new entrance to an archaeological tunnel near a Moslem shrine in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Palestinians said they were frustrated at the slow pace of peace moves.</p>
<p>Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring left for the region on Sunday to fly the European Union flag at the peace talks from which the bloc feels it has been excluded.</p>
<p>Christopher seemed cool to a direct European role, saying "any major change in the bilateral character of these negotiations is not likely to take place".</p>
<p>Spring, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, would not say whether he would visit the Palestinian Authority's Orient House offices in Arab East Jerusalem -- a move that would anger Israel as reflecting support for Palestinian claims to the holy city.</p>
