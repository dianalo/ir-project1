<p>French capital markets are more troubled by the shift in all political parties to a softer position on monetary union, than they are over the outcome of Sunday's round of parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>Analysts say even if the centre-right pull off a surprise win, similarity between the European views of its possible prime minister Philippe Seguin and Socialist leader Lionel Jospin means any short-term gains will be limited.</p>
<p>"There might be an emotional effect but an hour or two into trading it won't be seen to make much difference in bond and currency markets," Merril Lynch strategist Joanne Perez said.</p>
<p>"There's convergence in both camps. They're both rejecting further austerity to hit Maastricht terms."</p>
<p>Philippe Brossard, head of research at ABN Amro Finance, had a similar view.</p>
<p>"The market may bounce up very shortly but you are left with questions about Europe if Seguin arrives. For the foreign exchange and fixed income markets (the reaction) may not be very different," he said.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters are expecting the franc to weaken no further than 3.40 per mark on a Socialist win, and to strengthen to no more than 3.3620 if the coalition retains power.</p>
<p>In any case, lingering risk of a break with German market performance means convergence at the short end of the bond yield curve seen earlier this year is unlikely to be matched anytime soon, analysts said.</p>
<p>"Whoever wins, in the medium term the French market will never converge back to the same degree, particularly at the front of the curve," Iain Lindsay, senior bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais, said.</p>
<p>"The markets will always respect some premium in the PIBOR-Euromark spread."</p>
<p>The spread between three-month interest rate futures in France and Germany narrowed to five basis points in 1997 but widened to over 50 basis points after the first round of voting showed the left ahead.</p>
<p>The main talking point in the French market on Friday morning was whether the opposition Socialists would have enough seats in the National Assembly to govern without the Communists.</p>
<p>"It depends on the seats, the story in the market today is that maybe the Socialists can win on their own," Brossard said. "The franc would not gain much but it probably wouldn't fall much further."</p>
<p>"As for the bond market, I'm still a bit concerned with a minus 10 spread (between French and German 10-year bond yields) as we don't know what is going to happen," he said. "There are still plenty of questions for the markets about the budget."</p>
<p>But analysts said a row between the German government and its central bank about whether a revaluation of gold reserves can be used to trim outstanding debt levels would help temper any French bond market underperformance.</p>
<p>"If Lionel Jospin is serious about renegotiating the stability pact he will have to stop the whole European process which is positive for Germany," Brossard said. "The problem for Germany is that it's in such a mess over this row about gold reserves."</p>
<p>And the insatiable appetite for French franc bonds among domestic investors, already seen buying on market setbacks, could stem any losses, analysts said.</p>
<p>Many analysts' advice has been the same since rumours of a dissolution first hit French markets on April 17 - buy the dollar.</p>
<p>"The dollar is basically always a good bet in these circumstances," Perez said. "Whoever wins we're moving more and more to a 'soft' euro and I think that has to be good for the dollar against all of the hard core participants."</p>
