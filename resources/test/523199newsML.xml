<p>Singapore Telecommunications' share price has tumbled since it lost part of its local monopoly three weeks ago and analysts say the stock could drop further as competitors bite into SingTel's profit margins.</p>
<p>"On fundamentals, the share price still looks overvalued," said John Chessher, telecommunications analyst at Schroders.</p>
<p>Singapore liberalised its domestic mobile phone and pager market on April 1, allowing one new competitor, MobileOne (M1), to compete with SingTel in the handphone market and three new companies to offer pager services.</p>
<p>SingTel's share price fell as the open market loomed, settling at Singapore $3.00 (US$2.03) on deregulation day, down from S$3.40 in mid-February and a high of S$4.10 in June 1996.</p>
<p>But the share has dipped further to around S$2.80 since April 1 and analysts say it still looks expensive relative to other telecommunications companies around the region.</p>
<p>At S$2.80, SingTel has a historic price-to-earnings ratio of 28.8 times. This is well above the PE for Hong Kong Telecommunications, which at HK$13.40 (US$1.73), has a historic PE of only 15.4 times.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Telecom is part of the M1 consortium along with Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless, Singapore Press Holdings and Keppel Telecom.</p>
<p>While comparisons between PE ratios of companies on different stock markets are difficult to assess because of differing accounting practices and varying attitudes among investors, SingTel's share price is still high, some analysts say.</p>
<p>"SingTel is 50 percent more expensive than other telecom firms in the region but not growing as fast as some others," said a local analyst, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>Analysts say SingTel's share price still reflects its previous monopoly status, when margins for domestic phone calls and in the mobile market were untroubled by competitors.</p>
<p>In the financial year to March 31, 1996, SingTel made a pre-tax profit of S$1.96 billion on a turnover of S$4.00 billion, giving it an operating margin of almost 50 percent.</p>
<p>But the approach of competition has cut charges for its most lucrative source of income, International Direct Dialing (IDD).</p>
<p>Average Singapore IDD rates have fallen by around 20 percent in the last two years to around S$1.86 per minute and analysts see this trend accelerating when SingTel faces competitors in Singapore's basic telephone market from April 2000.</p>
<p>Profits in the other lucrative market, mobile phones, will inevitably be trimmed as M1 takes market share, they say.</p>
<p>Some analysts argue all this could drag the share price to below S$2.00. But most say it is highly unlikely that the government, which owns more than 82 percent of SingTel, would allow this.</p>
<p>SingTel's second public share offer, announced last year, is priced at S$2.50 and contains a loyalty bonus discouraging investors from selling.</p>
<p>"So if prices drop to S$2.50, many people would just hold on to the stock," said David Leow, analyst at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>Chessher also points out that SingTel will be paid compensation of S$1.5 billion for the loss of its basic telephone monopoly in 2000.</p>
<p>"So SingTel will be on the lookout for some major investment in telecoms or in an associated industry in Asia," he said. "That is likely to contribute to profits."</p>
<p>($1 = S$1.44 = HK$7.75)</p>
