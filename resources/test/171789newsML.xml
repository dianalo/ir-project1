<p>The Federal Reserve had no large one-day net misses in its reserve projections in the latest week, a Fed spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>As for the pattern of borrowing, 55 percent of the adjustment borrowing for the week was done by the small banks, and 45 percent was done by the large regionals. There was no borrowing by the money center banks.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, all of the borrowing was done by the small banks.</p>
<p>The high in natural float was about $1.6 billion on Wednesday, while the low was a bit under $75 million on Monday.</p>
<p>Transportation float averaged about $80 million per day, with the high on Wednesday at a bit over $200 million primarily due to weather-related delays in Charlotte, N.C.</p>
