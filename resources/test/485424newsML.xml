<p>Healthdyne Technologies Inc said Thursday that its board of directors unanimously recommends that shareholders reject Invacare Corp's revised tender offer of $13.50 per share for shares of the company and that shareholders not tender any of their shares.</p>
<p>The board said a sale of the company at this time is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders.</p>
<p>The company said it expects first quarter results to be "excellent," driven by strong revenue growth from its new products, and to meet or exceed analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>According to First Call, the consensus estimate for Healthdyne's first quarter is $0.13 a share, compared with for $0.14 the previous first quarter.</p>
<p>In a letter to A. Malachi Mixon, chief executive officer of Invacare, Healthdyne Chairman Parker Petit said he "cannot fathom" how Mixon could believe that a $0.50 per share increase in its offer would change Healthdyne's position and encourage the board to negotiate with him.</p>
<p>Healthdyne stock closed at 14 Wednesday.</p>
