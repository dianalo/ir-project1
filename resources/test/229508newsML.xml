<headline>German coffee roasters seen covered until March.</headline>
<dateline>HAMBURG 1996-12-02</dateline>

<p>German coffee roasters were mostly covered until the end of the first quarter of 1997 and therefore inactive in outright markets, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>Only higher than expected seasonal coffee sales at Christmas could create fresh gaps in raw materials cover.</p>
<p>"Weakness on London robustas may drag arabicas down as well but consumers are sidelined," one trader said ahead of the New York reopening after a long holiday weekend.</p>
<p>"It's quite possible that sell-stops will be hit and funds will start selling."</p>
<p>London robustas stayed in range amid profit-taking after hitting 31-month lows last Friday as charts looked weak and key support levels broke.</p>
<p>Physical market interest here focused on Central Americans and East Africans for the second quarter while exporters sought to place more nearby supplies.</p>
<p>Roasters believed the second half of the 1996/97 season would be comfortable because new crops would have been put into stores by then and Colombia might need to sell national stocks to secure revenue for infrastructure measures.</p>
<p>Outright arabica sellers' prices were steady or up to $3 per 50 kgs fob down on the week.</p>
<p>Colombia excelso was $134 and Brazils at $107.50 while Indonesian robustas eased $2.50 to $61 for Dec/Jan cif shipment. --Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275</p>
