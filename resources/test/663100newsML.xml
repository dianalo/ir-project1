<p>The Warsaw commodities exchange on Monday began trading in grain and meat options and sees turnover rising by at least 250 percent by the end of the year, the exchange's president said.</p>
<p>Jan Traczyk, President of the Warsaw Board of Trade (WGT), told a news conference that 174 options contracts changed hands during the session including 60 pork-belly call options, 114 grain call options and 15 wheat put options.</p>
<p>"We have planned a 250-percent increase in turnover and now we can say ...if secondary turnover is high we may have 300-percent growth or higher," Traczyk said.</p>
<p>He said the exchange traded in four-, seven-, eight- and 13-week options.</p>
<p>WGT said secondary trade in wheat, rye, maize, pork and beef options would be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>
<p>Traczyk said the exchange planned to add new products to options trading such as fuels and to add futures trade, which eventually should account for most of its turnover.</p>
<p>"We would like futures to account for at least 80 percent of all the trading on the exchange," Traczyk said.</p>
<p>The Warsaw exchange, established in 1995, has so far been carrying out cash transactions in main farm commodities.</p>
<p>Traczyk said WGT, which now has 52 shareholders, planned a new share issue in August or September, which would likely increase the number of the exchange's shareholders to 300.</p>
<p>"We are in talks with sugar and meat producers as well as with fuel traders and the next issue will probably be directed to specific individuals and companies," Traczyk said.</p>
<p>Deputy agriculture minister Ryszard Smolarek, also present, said trade in commodity options should help stabilise Poland's farm market.@</p>
<p>"The efective functioning of the echange will help carry out effective agricultural policy as the spreading over time sales (of commodities) will help smooth out price swings," Smolarek said.</p>
