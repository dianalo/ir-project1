<p>While economists have generally supported prompt disclosure of trades in financial markets, a group of academics have found that private trading can be more beneficial to investors in some circumstances.</p>
<p>Securities regulators in the United States have supported full, immediate disclosure, while those in other countries have allowed more opaque markets to flourish. All trades on the New York Stock Exchange are immediately reported, while the London Stock Exchange permits a delay of up to seven days in the case of very large trades.  </p>
<p>Anthony Neuberger of the London Business School and several colleagues set out to model the different disclosure approaches and determine which was best for investors. Contrary to the conventional wisdom and surprising some experts, they reached ambiguous conclusions.</p>
<p>"Under certain circumstances, disclosure can actually damage the welfare of the public trader," Neuberger said Thursday at a conference here sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.  </p>
<p>An investor selling securities may, for example, possess unique information about the value of the securities. In cases where the information is quite valuable, an investor approaching a dealer to conduct a trade might not want the trade revealed.</p>
<p>That is because the undisclosed trade would allow the dealer to then conduct further trades in the secondary market based on the same information. The dealer would give the investor a higher price for the securities in return for getting the information, Neuberger explained.</p>
<p>But if the trade had to be immediately disclosed, other market participants would likely realize the significance of the investor's unique information and the dealer would not be able to take advantage of the same information. The investor would then be offered a lower price, Neuberger said.</p>
<p>The findings, based on mathematical modeling of the parties and their incentives, are "very surprising," said David Marshall, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Marshall said when he first heard the result, he expected to find flaws in Neuberger's reasoning but did not. The paper "makes a major contribution" to the debate, he said.</p>
