<p>Roche Holding Ltd unit Hoffmann-La Roche Inc and Protein Design Labs Inc said on Wednesday two multinational Phase III trials showed Zenapax was successful in preventing kidney transplant rejection.  </p>
<p>The companies said in a statement that Roche's preliminary analysis of the data showed Zenapax was effective in reducing incidence of acute transplanted kidney rejection.</p>
<p>Zenapax was not seen causing any clinically significant adverse effects, the companies said.</p>
<p>Hoffmann-La Roche said based on the trials it planned to file for marketing clearance for Zenapax in the United States, Canada and Europe.</p>
<p>Basel, Switzerland-based Roche and its U.S. unit licensed exclusive worldwide rights to the drug from Protein Design Labs.  </p>
<p>Protein Design Labs would receive royalties based on sales, they said.</p>
<p>Roche declined to comment on the drug's potential value and Protein Design was not immediately available.</p>
<p>Zenapax, or dacliximab, is a humanized antibody.  Protein received a fundamental patent covering humanized antibodies including dacliximab in Europe in January and a U.S. patent for dacliximab in June.</p>
<p>The companies said Zenapax was effective when administered with a standard immunosuppressive regime.  </p>
<p>"These controlled trials show that Zenapax is a well- tolerated and effective immunosuppressant for kidney transplants," Flavio Vincenti, professor of clinical medicine at University of California, San Francisco said in a statement released by the companies.</p>
<p>Vincenti said reducing incidence of acute rejection would mean fewer patient rehospitalizations and treatments with anti-rejection drugs, which had significant side effects.</p>
<p>Protein Designs said its human and humanized, or computer-designed monoclonal antibodies, had a longer half-life and were less immunogenic than traditional antibodies derived from mice.</p>
