<p>President Bill Clinton, on a final campaign swing, on Wednesday promoted the opportunities created by his economic policies, a message that appears likely to keep him in the White House.</p>
<p>Leaving Washington in his final swing before Election Day on Tuesday and in the homestretch of his last bid for elective office, Clinton used an Eastern Michigan University appearance to take on Republican Bob Dole's claim that the nation's economy has been weak despite a rise in consumer confidence.</p>
<p>"Our economy is continuing to grow steady and strong," Clinton said, citing the improved state of the economy since he took office in 1993 and the benefits it has generated, particularly for women.</p>
<p>In Denver later, Clinton called the election "very historic" and urged his supporters to be sure to go to the polls.</p>
<p>"You know what to do. You know how to do it. Your country needs you. I know you'll be there," he told black voters at the first of two rallies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the White House rejected independent candidate Ross Perot's challenge to Clinton to join him in a televised election-eve debate.</p>
<p>"The president has set his schedule for the balance of the campaign. We've identified the issues that we'll be addressing, including campaign financing. I think we'll be doing our events, not Mr. Perot's," White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said on Wednesday the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a 2.2 percent annual rate from July through September, less than half the robust 4.7 percent pace posted in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Although administration officials tried to play down the slowdown -- Wall Street had feared growth of as little as 1.8 percent -- Dole's campaign quickly cited it as proof that the economy was not as strong as most Americans seem to think.</p>
<p>"The myth of the Clinton recovery has long been known to anxious wage-earners, and now the cold statistics Bill Clinton is so fond of are falling too," Dole campaign spokesman Nelson Warfield said.</p>
<p>Dole, who advocates an across-the-board 15 percent income tax cut, has centred his campaign on an economic package he says is necessary to revive economic growth.</p>
<p>Clinton, revelling in his front-runner status, said he was "a little amused" that Dole earlier in the day "said that we had the worst economy in 20 years." "Now, two weeks ago he said it was the worst enonomy in 100 years, so we're making progress," he noted.</p>
<p>With less than a week to go before the election, Dole's economic plan has generated only limited support. The latest Reuters tracking poll shows Clinton ahead of his Republican challenger by 12.6 percentage points.</p>
<p>Dole, in a bid to revive his fortunes, has been attacking Democrats for allegedly accepting money from contributors in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia.</p>
<p>An embarrassed Democratic Party has been trying to muffle the uproar it created when it initially announced it would not file a report to the Federal Election Commission on contributions and expenditures for the first two weeks of October.</p>
<p>Republicans threatened to seek a federal court injunction freezing all Democratic spending, but Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd, the Democratic Party chairman, said all documents would be released soon.</p>
<p>Clinton aides said he planned to discuss campaign financing in a speech on Friday in California and accuse Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich of standing in the way of previous reform efforts.</p>
<p>Dole once sentenced a campaign finance bill to death with a filibuster, or long, delaying speech. Gingrich agreed in a handshake with Clinton to reform campaign finance laws, but no changes were enacted.</p>
