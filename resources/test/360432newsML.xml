<p>Despite fourth-quarter corporate profits that beat expectations, Wall Street is showing signs of concerns that 1997 earnings will be squeezed by the rising U.S. dollar and tighter profit margins.</p>
<p>The jitters showed up Wednesday in a sharp selloff in technology stocks, which one analyst described as a "reality check" for the high-flying group.</p>
<p>"These companies have consistently beaten expectations," said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker. "We're now looking at a period where expectations are high, but the wind now has shifted into their face," he added.</p>
<p>The wind in the face of technology and other companies could be the dollar, which is trading near a four-year high against the Japanese yen. Worries are that multinational companies will see their export incomes shrink in dollar terms, analysts said.</p>
<p>The strong dollar could have been the factor that "pushed people off the fence" during Wednesday's selloff, said Hugh Johnson, chief invesment officer at First Albany.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average finished off 87 points Wednesday after diving more than 120 points in the session.</p>
<p>On Thursday, it rebounded to close up 26.16 at 6,773.06.</p>
<p>Another factor raising questions about 1997 corporate profits is the potential tightening of the U.S. labour market, which could put pressure on companies' labour costs, thus squeezing margins, analysts said.</p>
<p>Further signs of labour market tightness came on Thursday with a report that there were fewer applications for state jobless benefits last week than Wall Street had expected.</p>
<p>"There is a price-cost squeeze developing in the economy," Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said in a conference call this week. "Watch out for a lot of (earnings) disappointments."</p>
<p>Operating profits for companies in the S&amp;P 500 should grow an average 2.5 percent this year, Straszheim said. The Wall Street consensus is for a 14.7 percent rise, according to First Call.</p>
<p>Of the 378 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting through Wednesday, 218, or 58 percent, beat analysts' expectations, according to I/B/E/S, a Wall Street firm that tracks analysts' forecasts.</p>
<p>A total of 112 companies, or 30 percent of those reporting, surprised with fourth-quarter profits that were below expectations, while 48, or 13 percent, were on target.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 companies are headed toward posting an earnings gain of over 10 percent for the fourth quarter, compared with expectations at the outset of the reporting period of a rise of about 8 percent, said Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call. The gain is up from 5.6 percent in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Analysts said multinationals benefited from strong exports and were able to use currency hedging to keep the rising dollar from impacting their bottom lines in the fourth quarter. Any labour cost pressures had yet to show up, they said.</p>
<p>But some analysts and companies are indicating the scenario may be changing.</p>
<p>Wednesday's technology selloff was led by Intel Corp. after a Prudential Securities analyst downgraded his rating on the stock, saying last year may have marked the "best of times" for Intel's business fundamentals and its stock performance.</p>
<p>Adding to the downdraft was computer-networking leader Cisco Systems Inc., whose stock tumbled 6 percent despite its posting strong quarterly growth in revenues and earnings.</p>
<p>Analysts said the selloff was due to the company's cautious comments about business in its traditionally weak quarter ending in April.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Intel lost another $4.3125 to $152.9375 and Cisco gained 87.5 cents to $63.875, both on Nasdaq.</p>
