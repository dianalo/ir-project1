<p>Most North Sea Forties crude loadings in March have been delayed by one day, said one equity holder.</p>
<p>"Most of the cargoes have been deferred one day and some have been reduced," he said.</p>
<p>He said that one lifter has had two 600,000 barrel end-March cargoes reduced to 500,000 barrels each.</p>
<p>Traders said they had heard rumours of production problems at the Nelson and Miller fields in the Forties system.</p>
<p>"I don't know any details about production problems," said the equity holder.</p>
