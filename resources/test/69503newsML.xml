<p>Pakistani cotton rates rose on Sunday owing to a rise in demand from spinners amid rumours of a serious damage to cotton crop by pest attack, dealers said.</p>
<p>But they said the damage not severe and the prices would slip back after the situation cleared in a day or two.</p>
<p>"The rates will fall as soon as people will realise that the damage caused by the pest attack is not above the normal damage caused every year," dealer Mustafa Hussain said.</p>
<p>In the kerb market, the NIAB-78 variety from the 1996/97 crop was traded at 2,200 rupees ($59.36) per maund (37.32 kg).  </p>
