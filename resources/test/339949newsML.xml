<title>USA: Cigarette content hearings can go forward - judge.</title>
<headline>Cigarette content hearings can go forward - judge.</headline>

<p>A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that public hearings to assess how to evaluate cigarette brand ingredients could go forward in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge George O'Toole was unconvinced by lawyers' arguments that the tobacco companies would suffer "irreparable harm" if the hearings were held as scheduled.</p>
<p>The companies include Philip Morris Cos, Inc, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp, Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp, a unit of B.A. T Industries Plc and Lorillard Tobacco Co, a unit of Loews Corp.  </p>
<p>Massachusetts passed a 1996 law requiring tobacco companies to provide a list of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco ingredients by brand to the state's Department of Public Health (DPH), which will now hold hearings on Thursday and Friday to determine how to assess those ingredients.</p>
<p>Under the law, the DPH is to evaluate the ingredients and, if they find them to be a public health risk, release the list to the general public after the Massachusetts attorney general rules on whether to do so would be constitutional.  </p>
<p>Both the companies and the state agreed to delay the submissions to the DPH until July 1, 1997 by which time both sides hope Judge O'Toole will rule on an August 1996 lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the state law.</p>
<p>The tobacco firms maintain that cigarette ingredients, their combinations and relative amounts are trade secrets and therefore should be treated as protected property under the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>They also argue that federal law preempts the Massachusetts law and that the ingredient disclosure provisions conflict with federal confidentiality requirements.  </p>
<p>Tobacco company lawyer Harry Dinger argued that the hearings presented his clients with "a Hobson's choice...If we participate, as a practical matter, it will be necessary to disclose the information we brought this action to protect."</p>
<p>Massachusetts Assistant Attorney General Thomas Barnico argued that the tobacco firms had misread the regulations and that the hearings were public discourse.</p>
<p>"They have a choice, to put it simply, whether to participate or not," Barnico said.</p>
<p>He said the tobacco companies' comments could be very general and did not have to include specific cigarette ingredients.</p>
<p>"I'm not persuaded there is irreparable harm..." Judge O'Toole said in denying the tobacco companies' motion.</p>
<p>DPH Deputy Commissioner Greg Connolly told reporters  that Thursday's hearing would deal with how much tar and nicotine smokers receive from cigarettes. Friday's hearing will discuss cigarette ingredients, he said.</p>
