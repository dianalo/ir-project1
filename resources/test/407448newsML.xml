<p>The high sulphur fuel oil held steady to soft on Thursday with little interest in physical activities while swaps weakened with the release of bearish Singapore stock data, traders said.</p>
<p>The Trade Development Board (TDB) announced a rise of 1.974 million barrels to 12.299 million barrels, the highest since May 1996 when stocks totalled 12.516 million barrels.</p>
<p>Fuel oil swaps softened after the release of the data, with March and April swaps dropping to $99.50/$100.50 and $98.50/$99.50 respectively.</p>
<p>"The market is definitely oversupplied. There are no buyers and many are waiting for further price falls," said one major.</p>
<p>"The market is weakening," said one independent.</p>
<p>Supplies were also added by an unexpected shipment of 110,000 tonnes of fuel oil to Singapore from South Korea last week and 150,000 tonnes from the United States this week, traders said.</p>
<p>Some Middle East cargoes are still heading for Singapore but an independent said the market should be able to absorb the supplies. </p>
<p>Some traders still saw demand in the bunker market, expecting activities on Friday.</p>
<p>"Overall, the key is still Chinese movements," the trader said.</p>
<p>Without fundamental changes in the near term, anticipation for the return of Chinese players might support prices but traders did not expect major movements.</p>
<p>Chinese players have covered their requirements for at least the first half of March and may not be eager to participate in the market soon, traders said.</p>
