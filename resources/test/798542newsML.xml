<p>Bouyant U.S. gasoline prices were tempting cargoes transatlantic from an already tight European market, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Some of the prices paid for cargoes in the U.S., are staggering...the high numbers are tempting people to arb cargoes," said one oil major trader.</p>
<p>Since the middle of last week up to 150,000 tonnes or some five cargoes are likely to head to the U.S. Dealers said the movement has some pace but is a far cry from the armadas of gasoline seen in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>U.S. gasoline futures, pushed higher by tight local supplies and continued draws in stocks, have helped keep cash prices on the boil.</p>
<p>New York harbour gasoline was pegged around 79 cents a gallon, about $276 a tonne, on Thursday from $260 five days earlier. In comparison unleaded gasoline traded at $230 fob Rotterdam on Thursday.</p>
<p>"If you have prompt barrels and a discounted ship, then it makes sense (to arbitrage)," said one trader.</p>
<p>Gasoline has been the prime driving force for the whole oil market in recent weeks, but it has been susceptible to sharp price swings. This volatility is prompting caution among traders tempted to arbitrage, dealers said.</p>
<p>"How are you going to call where the U.S. is going to be in a couple of weeks with backwardation so strong," said one.</p>
<p>NYMEX unleaded gasoline September futures were around 66.90 cents a gallon compared with October around 61.30 cents.</p>
<p>As September approaches the danger of an arbitrager getting caught increases, dealers said.</p>
<p>Demand for gasoline tails off in the U.S. as the holiday season ends. September demand for gasoline is traditionally around 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) less than in August, a trader at a U.S. oil company said.</p>
<p>European consumers usually use 190,000 bpd less gasoline in September compared with August.</p>
<p>"Going to the U.S. is working at the moment, but one has to be cautious about how long to keep going," said a European trader.</p>
<p>The situation was complicated by some leverage buying in Europe which has kicked prices up nearly $20 in two days.</p>
<p>"European prices are higher because they reflect a real tightness, real demand and real backwardation but whether by the amounts we are seeing is debatable...there is some leveraging going on against big swaps positons," said one trader.</p>
