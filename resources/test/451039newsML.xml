<p>German Bayer AG on Tuesday promised more record results for 1997, with planned acquisitions and a pickup in global economic growth seen boosting business, but its shares still tumbled.</p>
<p>Fresh from reporting its second consecutive set of record profits and sales in 1996, the German chemicals and drugs giant said the uptrend should continue, especially after January and February sales already topped year-ago levels by eight percent.</p>
<p>"The chances are good we will match last year's profits this year and the chances are realistic we will top profits," Bayer management board chairman Manfred Schneider told a news conference.</p>
<p>Analysts, while noting Bayer's outlooks are usually a touch reserved, said the tone of this year's outlook was particularly numbing and therefore hit the market very hard.</p>
<p>"The market was floored by Bayer's outlook," said Penny Tattersall, analyst at CS First Boston in London, explaining that with improved currency relations and lower restructuring costs Bayer should automatically beat last year's results, indicating margins might not be good this year.</p>
<p>After Bayer's 1996 net profit surged 13.5 percent to 2.7 billion marks ($1.6 billion) while sales rose nine percent to 48.6 billion marks, the group predicted its 1997 sales would top 50 billion marks.</p>
<p>Schneider said the company faced various constraints, including ongoing price pressures and plans to expand the sales force, which would create higher costs with possibly lower revenues.</p>
<p>Shocked by the statements, investors turned Bayer into the day's worst performer among the chemical companies with shares ending a generally weak bourse session down 3.10 marks, or 4.3 percent, at 68.70 marks.</p>
<p>Some analysts said Bayer fared relatively poorly because it disappointed unrealistically high investor expectations and was partly bearing the brunt of the market's disappointment about rival Hoechst AG's very weak numbers last week.</p>
<p>"All the chemicals are weak today as market expectations were simply unrealistically strong, topping even analysts' forecasts," BHF Bank analyst Ronald Koehler said.</p>
<p>Bayer chief financial officer Helmut Loehr said the growth engines for 1997 should again be health care business, agricultural business and the restructured polymers business.</p>
<p>Last year polymers generated an 11 percent rise in sales to 14.7 billion marks, trailed by six percent increase in health care sales to 11.8 billion marks.</p>
<p>In the health care business, the main contributor was the growing drugs business where blockbuster drugs Adalat and Cipro lead sales, Schneider said, adding more product launches were planned for the future. This too made analysts slightly cautious since drug launches generally have very high marketing costs initially, only turning into money-makers later.</p>
<p>Bayer, which has in the past shied away from making spectacular takeovers and instead prefers to grow through smaller acquisitions, said it was again eyeing new takeovers at a cost of under one billion dollars each.</p>
<p>Some concrete talks were already underway, chief financial officer Loehr said, declining however to be more specific. "In general we are looking to grow in North American and Asia and in the polymers and life science areas," he said.</p>
<p>In addition to external growth generated through acquisitions, Bayer is betting on internal growth funnelling 3.7 billion marks in research and development and 4.1 billion marks into capital expenditures.</p>
<p>But Bayer also stressed that it plans to remain a company with two to three pillars, sticking by its strategy to remain an integrated chemicals and drugs group rather than following rival Hoechst AG's example of trying to streamline its portfolio to focus very strongly on life sciences.</p>
<p>Consequently Schneider said there were no plans to sell the Agfa photo unit, which posted an 18.5 percent improvement in 1996 operating results, helping dispel Agfa's image as the ugly duckling among the Bayer businesses.</p>
<p>Bayer however remained unhappy with its chemicals business where the operating result dropped 79 percent and the return on sales barely reached one percent, Schneider said.</p>
<p>The group promised to stick to its restructuring programme and said job cuts at its parent company this year were inevitable even though jobs would be created in the growth regions of North America and Asia.</p>
