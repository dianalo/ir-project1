<p>Bombay share prices recovered from early losses by mid-day on Friday, but gains were limited to select stocks with bargain hunters expected to cushion profit-taking, traders said.</p>
<p>"We have seen some profit-taking early on, but the markets seem to be stabilising near these levels," said a dealer at a foreign securities firm.</p>
<p>Local funds were booking profits in select stocks, but bargain-hunting at lower levels could reverse any sharp fall, brokers said.</p>
<p>"Buying support is still coming in at these levels. The undertone is quite firm," said Maulik Sharedalal, a member-broker of the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>By 1250 hours (0720 GMT), Bombay's top share index was up 3.63 points at 4,327.09 after falling to 4,300.58 earlier.</p>
