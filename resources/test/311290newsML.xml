<headline>LME metals retreat by end after attack on upside.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-16</dateline>

<p>LME metals prices took a breath on Thursday afternoon, drifting back after several days of heated rises.</p>
<p>Many in the complex still have upside potential, but need to consolidate before resuming the upward path, analysts said.</p>
<p>"Short term it has done enough. The whole complex needs to pause," said analyst William Adams of broker Rudolf Wolff.</p>
<p>Metals marched higher in the morning, with nickel and tin scoring four-month highs, zinc pushing to a new 23-month peak, lead at its strongest for two months and aluminium matching an eight-month high.  </p>
<p>Copper ran up to $2,295 on commission house buying, but when it failed to surmount the psychological $2,300 level, profit-taking came in, traders said.</p>
<p>The move lower took copper away from the next major target for the market, the November 28 high of $2,313.</p>
<p>Lending contributed to the softer tone and prices eased further in the afternoon, ending the kerb at $2,248, down $14.</p>
<p>The premium of cash over three months flared to $185/90 in the morning, but came in about $10 by the close.</p>
<p>Aluminium failed for the third time to breach $1,625, matching Monday's and Tuesday's peaks.  </p>
<p>It needs to close above $1,123/4 to further spice up the technical picture and break above a two-year sideways pattern.</p>
<p>Lead broke through the key $723 level on its way to peaking at $730, but like the others, retreated to close the kerb at $710, down $6.</p>
<p>Nickel earlier knocked down an important Elliott Wave chartpoint at $7,450 on its way to $7,490, but drifted back to finish at $7,380, off $30.</p>
<p>Tin joined the others, rising to $6,130 before sliding back to close $90 lower at $5,985.</p>
<p>Alloy was little changed at $1,510/12 from $1,508/10.</p>

<p>Call option buying has been helping keep aluminium buoyant, Wolff's Adams said.</p>
<p>The market needs a rest to calm its overbought status while producer selling is expected to trim the upside, traders said.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, aluminium had drifted back to $1,507, off $10.</p>
<p>Zinc, which along with lead was earlier boosted by fund short-covering, carved out a fresh high at $1,133. It drifted back with the others, finishing the day $2 down at $1,120.</p>
<p>Chartists say it needs a spell of consolidation after soaring by more than 10 percent this week.</p>
