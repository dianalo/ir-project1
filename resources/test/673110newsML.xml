<title>USA: Rice prices surge on El Nino threat to crops.</title>
<headline>Rice prices surge on El Nino threat to crops.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-19</dateline>

<p>Rice futures rose sharply in heavy volume on Thursday amid growing concern about the impact of the developing El Nino weather pattern off western South America on crops in Asia.</p>
<p>"There's legitimate weather concerns," said Jack Scoville, analyst with the Price Group brokerage in Chicago. "If this El Nino does do anything, it will hit rice producing areas in India, the North China plains and the Philippines."</p>
<p>The so-called El Nino is a periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean off South America that has profound consequences for global weather.</p>
<p>El Nino weather patterns have in the past caused drought or drought-like conditions in some Asian nations and could cut the world rice crop, particularly in India, traders said.</p>
<p>Analysts in India said sowings of the new rice crop were about to begin but the progress of monsoon rains had been been "satisfactory" in the southern and central states.</p>
<p>"The onset of the monsoon is weak and the progress tardy," said one Bombay, India-based analyst.</p>
<p>For the second consecutive session, almost all delivery months for rice made life-of-contract highs at the Chicago Board of Trade. The exception, July, rose to a two-month peak of $11.90 per hundred pounds before closing 8.5 cents higher at $11.75.</p>
<p>Rice's strong performance contrasted starkly with other CBOT grain contracts, which remained locked in downtrends.</p>
<p>"You've got only one bull market going on this (trading) floor, and it's rice," said one trader.</p>
<p>Wheat futures fell to a 4-1/2 month low as early reports on this year's harvest continued to suggest better-than-expected yields.</p>
<p>"I heard 59 to 66 bushels per acre in some parts of Sumner County (Kansas) -- that's way above the average," one wheat trader said.</p>
<p>Harvesting of hard red winter wheat is in full swing in Texas and Oklahoma and is just getting underway in Kansas, the leading U.S. winter wheat producing state.</p>
<p>The Agriculture Department estimates an average yield for the whole of Kansas last year of 29 bushels an acre.</p>
<p>Wheat for July delivery on the CBOT closed 1-3/4 cents lower at $3.37 a bushel after touching a low of $3.36.</p>
<p>Corn prices also continued to fall on nearly ideal crop weather in the key growing states of the U.S. Midwest.</p>
<p>Meteorologists said rain should cover much of the western Midwest through Friday, bringing moisture to the dry areas of western Iowa.</p>
<p>Traders said the condition of the U.S. corn crop appeared to be improving and that there were prospects for a bumper corn crop. Iowa and Illinois are the leading corn producing states in the United States.</p>
<p>The key new crop delivery month, December, tumbled to a life-of-contract low of $2.43-1/4 and closed down 1-3/4 cents at $2.43-1/2.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange gasoline, ended lower as traders focused on high gasoline output and imports.</p>
<p>"We had more liquidation today as gasoline output continues to outstrip demand, and imports are historically high," said Al Lindseth, manager of oil and gas hedge programmes at GSC Energy in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Gasoline for July delivery settled 0.69 cent lower at 56.09 cents a gallon, and depressed oil prices generally.</p>
<p>July crude oil ended 12 cents a barrel lower at $18.67, while July heating oil finished up 0.01 cent at 51.45 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said refineries produced a record 8.23 million barrels per day of gasoline for the week ended June 13.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, gasoline imports have been between a hefty 450,000 and 500,000 barrels per day in recent weeks.</p>
<p>A proposal by Britain and the United States to impose new sanctions on Iraq for blocking U.N. weapons inspection teams several times this month failed to halt the decline.</p>
