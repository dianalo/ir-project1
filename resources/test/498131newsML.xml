<p>Economic performance is a major issue in British voters' minds, but the electorate perceive little difference between the economic policies of the two major parties, a Reuters survey of the country's top political experts showed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In another blow to the embattled Conservative government, many experts said the lack of clear blue water between Conservative and Labour on economic issues would boost Labour's support in the run-up to the general election on May 1.</p>
<p>Fifteen of the 20 experts canvassed between April 7 and 8 said there was only a narrow gap between the economic policies of the two main parties.</p>
<p>While Britain's economy is currently one of the most robust in Europe, voters appear reluctant to credit John Major's Conservatives.</p>
<p>The absence of any clear differences would mean electors would no longer see a switch to Labour as a "leap in the dark" to the old tax-and-spend Labour policies, some experts said.</p>
<p>"The difference isn't much more than none," said Colin Rallings of the University of Plymouth.</p>
<p>"The electorate is thinking they can have a change (in government) because it won't lead to a radical change in their circumstances or the nation's circumstances," he said. "It's a safe time for change and not a leap in the dark."</p>
<p>Ben Pimlott of London's Birkbeck College agreed.</p>
<p>"Labour has historically, over the last 20 years, aroused fears in the electorate because of taxes. The absence of a gap means the absence of fear," he said.</p>
<p>Labour, in a bid to woo Conservative waverers, has promised not to raise the main rates of income tax during the next parliament if they win the election. Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats have said they would fund increased spending on education by putting one penny on the basic rate of income tax.</p>
<p>But Robert Worcester, chairman of the MORI polling organisation, took an opposing view, saying the Conservatives should fare better because of their stronger economic record and voters' reluctance to trust an inexperienced party.</p>
<p>"Better the devil you know than the devil you dont," he said.</p>
<p>While voters are still mindful of Conservative blunders with the economy, particularly sterling's exit from Europe's exchange rate mechanism in 1992, Labour still has to shed its image of a tax-and-spend party.</p>
<p>"The public expect Labour to spend more on health, education and public transport...and therefore expect taxes to be higher under Labour," said journalist and poll-watcher Peter Kellner.</p>
<p>The mean forecast from all the experts pointed to a Labour majority of 83 seats in the next parliament, with Labour set to gain 45 percent of the support, 10 points ahead of the Conservatives with 35 percent.</p>
<p>The Liberal Democrats were forecast to get 15 percent, and other parties three percent.</p>
