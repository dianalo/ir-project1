<p>Peruvian troops stormed the besieged Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima on Tuesday and local radio said all the Marxist rebels holding the building and one of their 72 hostages had been killed.</p>
<p>Local television said earlier all 72 hostages held by the rebels for 126 days had been rescued alive.</p>
<p>Masked soldiers waved rifles in the air, cheered, sang the national anthem and punched their fists in the air after the 40-minute operation to end Latin America's longest hostage siege.</p>
<p>President Alberto Fujimori, wearing a bullet-proof jacket, arrived at the site immediately afterwards and entered the compound where he was cheered by soldiers.</p>
<p>They swarmed into the building from private houses behind the diplomatic compound at 3.20 P.M. (2020 GMT) and engaged about 20 Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels in a fierce but brief battle punctuated by billowing smoke, gunfire and explosions.</p>
<p>At about 4 P.M. they triumphantly pulled down the MRTA flag that had flown over the residence since it was stormed in an audacious pre-Christmas raid during a cocktail party on Dec. 17.</p>
<p>The freed hostages included Peru's Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela and Japanese ambassador Morihisa Aoki as well as other senior government officials..</p>
<p>At least five of the hostages were injured, four carried out on stretchers. Seven policemen were also injured, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Fujimori -- who faced the worst crisis of his turbulent seven years in office over the hostage seizure -- arrived at the building soon after the battle ended.</p>
<p>The storming of the residence came after negotations between the Peruvian government and rebels -- mainly via a three-man guarantors committee -- had failed to bring a breakthrough.</p>
<p>The MRTA wanted the release of jailed comrades, a demand the government had always rejected.</p>
<p>The Cuban-inspired MRTA is the smallest of Peru's two main rebel movements. Violent conflicts unleashed by it and the larger Shining Path movement have cost 30,000 lives and $25 billion in infrastructure damage in Peru since 1980.</p>
<p>Pale and fraught-looking relatives and friends of the hostages gathered outside the Lima Police Hospital where they were expected to be taken.</p>
