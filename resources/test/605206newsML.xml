<headline>NZ bank bill yields drop as pressure off MCI, TWI.</headline>

<p>New Zealand bank bill yields fell sharply on Friday morning as traders reacted to a strengthening in the Trade-Weighted Index and a tighter monetary conditions index (MCI).</p>
<p>A rebound in the U.S. dollar against the yen was largely responsible for the TWI and MCI moves.  </p>
<p>The dollar-yen has become a proxy for the TWI and dealers expect further volatility from that quarter and a good probability of a sudden reversal.</p>
<p>"I think we are going to see things settle down and get back into a phase of watching the TWI again," said a Wellington bill dealer. "The bullishness can only last so long and if that TWI moves under 67.30 again I think you will see the market come back a little bit."</p>
<p>Talk of a rate cut in Australia has also helped strengthen the TWI.  </p>
<p>The Reserve Bank is seen as more comfortable with the MCI at minus 75 compared with -85 at Thursday's close. Dealers said the the market had acted sensibly by not ramming the index back to Thursday's level.</p>
<p>"The market realised the bulk of the work had to be done by the currency. Even so, if you look at the level of TWI, the MCI and the bank bills, it's only a marginal buy," one said.</p>
<p>The shorter dates responded to the lower bank bill rates. A Dresdner Finance NZ$100 million eurokiwi issued overnight was seen as already hedged.  </p>
<p>A bond dealer said there were few buyers for the 11/06 bonds at 7.58 percent and only up around 7.63 do investors feel more comfortable.</p>
