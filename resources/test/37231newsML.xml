<p>Another chapter of British colonial rule in Hong Kong drew to a close on Friday with a squadron of Gurkha soldiers giving its final salute.</p>
<p>In the dying light of dusk, the flag of the disbanded 67 Gurkha Independent Field Squadron, Queen's Gurkha Engineers, was lowered for the last time, accompanied by a sombre repertoire from the Band of the Corps of Royal Engineers.</p>
<p>The British army is packing up ahead of the handover of Hong Kong to China -- now less than 300 days away at midnight on June 30, 1997 --  and is vacating its quarters at Sek Kong in the heart of the New Territories.</p>
<p>"This is a sad evening for the Queen's Gurkha Engineers, a sad evening for Hong Kong," Major General Bryan Dutton, Commander of the British Forces in Hong Kong said, as he took the final salute from the Gurkha soldiers.</p>
<p>The squadron first served in Hong Kong between 1962 and 1966 and returned to the territory from Malaysia in 1970.</p>
<p>Families of the soldiers and well-wishers turned out to witness an event signifying the near end of a 150-year era of British colonial rule.</p>
<p>The Gurkhas are mercenary Nepali soldiers known for their extreme loyalty and deadly skills, especially in close combat. They are best remembered for having fought alongside the British in two world wars and in Southeast Asia against communist rebels in the Malayan Emergency of 1948-1960.</p>
<p>"It is our ethos that we look ahead to our next challenge rather than wasting energy and emotion on looking back at what might have been," Dutton told the 120 Gurkha engineer-soldiers.</p>
<p>Half of the squadron, which has assisted in road-building projects in remote parts of Nepal near Everest over the past two years, will be deployed to units in Britain.</p>
<p>Most of the remaining men have opted either to take up other jobs in Hong Kong or to return to civilian life in Nepal.</p>
<p>"It is very sad for me, my family. I will go back to Nepal but I have not yet decided what I will do," said Staff Sergeant Gurung, who has served in the British army for 11 years.</p>
