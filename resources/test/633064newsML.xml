<headline>VODAFONE OFF LOWS AFTER RESULTS.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-03</dateline>

<p>Shares in Vodafone Group Plc were steady and well above lows on Tuesday after the mobile telephone company reported a 13 percent rise in full-year, pre-tax profit.</p>
<p>The shares were trading unchanged on the day at 271-1/2p by 1340 GMT after an earlier low of 265p.</p>
<p>"The figures are on the upper end of forecasts," one trader said, adding the outlook for Vodaphone seemed to be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Vodafone said its pre-tax profit in the year to March 31 rose to 539 million pounds from 475 million pounds. Analysts had expected a figure between 525 and 543 million pounds.</p>
<p>The company, which expects to gain up to 400,000 new GSM-subscribers in Britain this year, said average revenue per customer dropped during the 12-month period, however.</p>
