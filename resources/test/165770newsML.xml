<p>Eastern Europe, not always unreserved in its admiration of President Boris Yeltsin, still welcomed reports on Tuesday that the Russian leader's heart operation had gone well for the sake of regional stability.</p>
<p>Many people in Moscow's former satellites are ambivalent about Yeltsin, whom one Polish politician earlier this year described as "not the president of our dreams".</p>
<p>But governments in post-communist capitals expressed hope that the 65-year-old Yeltsin would quickly return to work at a time when Russian politicians are bitterly fighting each other.</p>
<p>"The stability of Russia is one of the key factors for the stability of Europe and the world," said Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec. "The recovery of Mr Yeltsin will contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in Russia."</p>
<p>Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski issued a statement through his spokesman saying he was happy at the operation's success and the good prognoses. Kwasniewski wished Yeltsin "the fastest possible return to health and his state duties".</p>
<p>In Moscow U.S. surgeon Michael DeBakey, who monitored the treatment, described the operation as a complete success and said Yeltsin would be able to return to his office and carry out his duties normally.</p>
<p>Czech President Vaclav Havel has in the past criticised Moscow for its bloody intervention in Chechnya.</p>
<p>Also in Prague, where memories linger of the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of the former Czechoslovakia, Yeltsin's fierce opposition to NATO's plan to recruit new members from the former East Bloc have not always gone down well.</p>
<p>But in Poland, a leading candidate for early NATO membership, a senior reform communist said that his party had been very worried about Yeltsin's health.</p>
<p>"What has been happening recently in Russia before President Yeltsin's operation -- certain political manouevres and a power struggle in the Kremlin -- is not a healthy phenomenon as destabilisation of the situation in Russia can adversely affect conditions not just in Europe but in the world," said Longin Pastusiak, deputy head of the ruling, ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) in parliament.</p>
<p>"It is very important for us that there should be clarity in this situation, that we should know who is in charge in Russia, because all kinds of conflicts like the recent ones ... are sure to cause unease in other countries," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, constantly wary of instability in their huge Russian neighbour, expressed hope on Tuesday that all would be well with Yeltsin.</p>
<p>"We hope for a favourable result to keep stability in Russia," Lithuanian deputy foreign minister Albinas Janushka told Reuters.</p>
<p>Outgoing Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev sent Yeltsin a telegram wishing him a swift return to work "in the name of (Russia's) further democratisation".</p>
<p>In Romania, where President Ion Iliescu is fighting for re-election after seven years in power, the head of his ruling Party of Social Democracy tried to draw some parallels.</p>
<p>"Yeltsin was elected because he represented a guarantee for the democratic development and stability of Russia," said Adrian Nastase, who is also the chairman of the lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>"For Romania, it is important that Iliescu should win a second term in office as to guarantee the continuation of democratic reforms in Romania, including its chances to integrate in NATO," he said.</p>
