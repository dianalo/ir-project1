<p>Austrian savings bank First Austrian played a wild card in the sell-off of Creditanstalt on Tuesday when it announced plans to form a consortium and outbid its former allies for a stake in the nation's flagship bank.</p>
<p>Die Erste Oesterreichische SparCasse Bank (First Austrian) said in a statement it aimed to seek an "Austrian solution" to the privatisation of Creditanstalt while raising the efficiency of the country's overcrowded banking sector.</p>
<p>"The board has been empowered to take measures towards forming and leading a strategic and financially strong bidding group...and develop a banking cooperation with Creditanstalt," First Austrian said.</p>
<p>First Austrian, one of the nation's top five banks, quit an Austro-Italian-German consortium on September 6 citing disagreement over the form its bid should take.</p>
<p>First Austrian had favoured an alliance with the former banker to the Habsburgs through a holding company, a scheme rejected by its partners and Creditanstalt.</p>
<p>The finance ministry cleared the way for First Austrian to rejoin the poker game on Monday when it rejected a cash offer by the consortium and said it was starting from scratch for the third time in five and a half years.</p>
<p>The government's sale advisor, U.S. investment house J.P. Morgan, will make a fresh assessment of Creditanstalt and the finance ministry expects to pinpoint potential investors in the next six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>Last year J.P. Morgan valued the government's 70 percent of Creditanstalt ordinary voting shares at 17.5 to 18.7 billion schillings. At the current share price, its stake is worth 12.6 billion schillings.</p>
<p>First Austrian declined to name its potential consortium partners but analysts suggested the bank may try to steal some smaller members from the Austrian-Italian-German consortium, headed by insurer EA-Generali and including Germany's Commerzbank and Banca Commerciale Italiana.</p>
<p>"They may try for some of the members of the old consortium. Otherwise they could look at another insurance group or other savings banks," said Gerhard Auer of ICE Securities in London.</p>
<p>Possible candidates could include Austria's second biggest insurance company Versicherungsanstalt der Oesterreichischen Bundeslaender Versicherungs AG and the nation's biggest health insurer Austria-Collegialitaet, experts said.</p>
<p>First Austrian was unlikely to find favour with the leading members of the EA-Generali group but may succeed in winning over some of the industrial firms, they added.</p>
<p>Creditanstalt, meanwhile, has made little secret of its preference for the EA-Generali group, which has said it is still interested in acquiring a stake in the most traditional of Austrian banks despite the failure of its most recent bid.</p>
<p>"I can tell you, the buyer won't come out of the blue. It is consistent with the interests of Creditanstalt shareholders, that the bank joins forces with an Italian and a German group," chief executive Guido Schmidt-Chiari told journalists.</p>
<p>Schmidt-Chiari and Finance Minister Viktor Klima expressed confidence that the sale would be well underway by the end of the year, bringing much needed cash into state coffers.</p>
<p>"I am determined that we will reach a decision on the privatisation of Creditanstalt in 1996," Klima said.</p>
<p>Analysts did not share their optimism, however, and noted the government's long struggle to find a buyer for Creditanstalt had become a national embarrassment.</p>
<p>"The story is losing its appeal and it is getting more and more difficult to speculate. It is also very sad for Creditanstalt," ICE Securities' Auer said.</p>
