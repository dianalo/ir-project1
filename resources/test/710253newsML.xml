<p>The Brazilian state of Parana should produce 25 million tonnes of sugarcane this harvest, up from 23 million tonnes in 1996/97, the State Agricultural Secretariat said in a press release.</p>
<p>Parana output is expected to account for between eight and 10 percent of national production, put by the secretariat at 300 million tonnes in 1997/98. Brazilian sugar production is forecast at 14.8 million tonnes, the secretariat said.</p>
<p>Within the government crop plan, total sugar output is plotted at 13.48 million tonnes, 760,000 tonnes of which are to come from Parana.</p>
<p>The state's sugar and alcohol industries are running into problems due to a shortage of labor, the release said.</p>
<p>The local sugar and alcohol producers' association estimates there are 4,000 workers too few to cut the cane due to the migration of workers to large urban areas, it added.</p>
