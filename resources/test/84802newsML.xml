<p>Estonia will reorganise its state infrastructure firms into joint-stock or holding companies and sell majority stakes or daughter companies to investors, the Estonian Privatisation Agency (EPA) said on Monday.</p>
<p>The idea was to sell stocks rather than assets to make the privatisation flexible, said EPA Director General Vaino Sarnet.</p>
<p>"Governments everywhere have been bad owners so we need to sell state-owned firms, we need investments and know-how to get services of high quality," he told a seminar on infrastructure privatisation.</p>
<p>Having sold off many of its industrial companies, Estonia is now engaged on the sale of its large firms such as Estonian Energy, Tallinn Port, Estonian Railways, Estonian Oil Shale and Estonian Telecom.</p>
<p>Varnet said strategic objects like power lines and port quays should remain state-owned but could be run privately.</p>
<p>Economics Minister Andres Lipstock said that the privatisation programme for Estonian Oil Shale and Estonian Energy must be signed by November 1 and the other firms have to complete their plans by January 1 next year.</p>
<p>Estonian Energy already has a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. firm NRG, part of Northern States Power, and negotiations on setting up a joint firm are going on.</p>
