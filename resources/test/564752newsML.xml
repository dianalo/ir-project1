<p>Beijing has ordered all fishing boats to re-register to limit catches at sea and in inland waters to protect marine resources and halt a decline in the number of fish in China's rivers, state media said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Under the directive from the Ministry of Agriculture, China will restrict the number of fishing vessels involved and the horsepower of their engines, limiting the total to 265,620 by the end of the century.</p>
<p>New fishing licences issued by the Ministry of Agriculture will take effect from July 1 and no new fishing vessels can obtain a licence before that date.</p>
<p>Licences will be issued only by the National Administration of Fishery Management and Ports or the Fisheries Bureau, whereas previously licences were available from provincial authorities, which allowed some provinces to increase numbers for their own interests, the China Daily quoted Fisheries Bureau deputy director Yang Jian as saying.</p>
<p>In 1995, output of oceanic fishing was 10.26 million tonnes, accounting for 45 percent of total aquatic ouput. China's marine industry increased at an annual rate of 11.4 percent over the past 12 years.</p>
<p>"However, excessive catches have led to a decline in the number of fish in rivers, posing a serious threat to sustained development," the circular said.</p>
