<p>Thailand was in danger of losing its premier position in an oversupplied world sugar market unless high production costs were cut and crop management improved, a Cane and Sugar Board official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pramote Vittayasuk, director-general of the Thai Cane and Sugar Board, told Reuters the board was now working on programmes to reduce costs, with the introduction of high-yield breeds the first step.</p>
<p>He said the board would start introducing the new, more disease-resistant breed to farmers this year.</p>
<p>The current Thai sugar cane yield per hectare is around 55 tonnes per hectare compared with Australia, Thailand's major competitor, which can produce up to 86 tonnes per hectare.</p>
<p>The new breed should help raise sugar cane yields up to 74 tonnes per hectare, he said.</p>
<p>The oversupply, which is driving prices down, would greatly affect the industry, he said.</p>
<p>"If measures are not introduced now to address the problem, the Thai sugar industry will be in trouble," Pramote said.</p>
<p>Pricing of Thai sugar exports was based on New York and London futures, so any drop in world prices would directly affect the price of Thai sugar, industry analysts said.</p>
<p>German statistician F.O. Licht forecast world sugar output for 1996/97 (September-October) should reach 123.28 million tonnes while consumption was seen at 120.29 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The expected surplus would push world sugar stocks up to 49.23 million tonnes from 47.12 million tonnes in 1995/96. Gross import demand for sugar was forecast to fall by about 1.8 million tonnes from last year's 38 million tonnes, it said.</p>
<p>Pramote said the cost of Thai cane production in the 1995/96 season was 3,020 baht ($116) per hectare and could be cut.</p>
<p>Besides introduction of new sugar cane breeds, the Cane and Sugar Board was also working on a crop zoning programme to regulate planting to avoid unnecessary surpluses, he added.</p>
<p>Programmes aimed at boosting cooperation between mills and sugar cane farmers during the crushing season would also be crucial to cost reductions, he said.</p>
<p>Normally, sugar cane farmers receive part of their payment in advance from the mills, but some did not meet their obligations and instead harvested sugar cane for other mills to make extra money. This practice had unnecessarily increased the production cost, Pramote said.</p>
<p>Another problem was that some farmers did not cooperate well with the mills on the amount required for each crushing and harvested more than needed by the mills.</p>
<p>This added to the burden of storage costs and caused the sugar cane quality to deteriorate, which subsequently affected the sugar yield.</p>
<p>"All these issues must be dealt with if we are to cut the cost and to stay competitive in this market," Pramote said.</p>
