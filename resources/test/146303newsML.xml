<p>More than 160,000 illegal workers have left the United Arab Emirates ahead of a new law cracking down on unlawful foreign labour, the interior minister said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The minister, Lieutenat-General Mohammed Said al-Badi, told reporters after opening a seminar on security and the media that the crackdown aimed at "rectifying an imbalance in the population and targeted all nationalities, not a specific one".</p>
<p>"The number of violators who have left the country until now stands at over 160,000 from various nationalities," Badi said. His remarks were carried by the official news agency WAM.</p>
<p>The UAE government, saying illegal aliens are a threat to the oil-producing country's security, has told them to leave or legalise their stay by the end of October. Diplomats say as many as 200,000 could leave by the deadline.</p>
<p>Thousands of foreign workers -- primarily from the Indian subcontinent but also from southeast Asia -- have been rushing to leave to avoid tough penalties when the new law takes effect on November 1.</p>
<p>If they are caught after the deadline, they face punishment including fines, prison terms and deportation.</p>
<p>Foreigners make up about 75 percent of the 2.4 million population in the small Gulf Arab state. Many came to the UAE legally, but broke the law by failing to leave when their visas expired or by working for employees other than their sponsors.</p>
