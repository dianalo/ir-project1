<p>The Research Institute of the Finnish Economy (ETLA) raised its forecast for Finnish 1997 gross domestic product growth to 3.5 percent from 2.5 percent forecast in June, ETLA said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>ETLA left its GDP forecast for 1996 unchanged at 2.5 percent.  </p>
<p>Its other main forecasts were unchanged too.</p>
<p>"Current information indicates that the EU countries are pulling out of their slump and growth is picking up," ETLA said in a statement.</p>
<p>"It could be justified to expect a relatively swift recovery in the economies of the EU countries since unemployment is high, meaning there are idle resources available, inflation pressures are low and monetary policy is expansionary," it said.</p>
<p>But ETLA said the tight fiscal policy stance in the EU could jeopardize economic growth in Europe.</p>
