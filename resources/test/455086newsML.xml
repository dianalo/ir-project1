<p>Year to December 31, 1996</p>
<p>(Figures in millions of French francs unless stated)</p>
<p>    Net income				   241.0  vs	   170.7</p>
<p>    Earnings per share (francs)	    14.18  vs	   10.04</p>
<p>    Operating				    115.0  vs	   124.4</p>
<p>    Financial				    119.6  vs	    50.0</p>
<p>    Turnover				   3,779.7  vs	 3,303.2</p>
<p>NOTE - Bouygues Offshore reported its 1996 results in a statement. It said net income includes a foreign exchange gain of 44 million francs.</p>
<p>It said the decrease in operating income was due to the fact that major contract work done in the oil and gas contracting segment during the year was primarily in the engineering and procurement phases, where operating income tends to be lower than in the later construction and installation phases. It said the drop was also due to lower activity at its Scottish yard.</p>
<p>The increase in next financial income was due to a net foreign exchange gain of 66 million francs in 1996, compared with a net foreign exchange loss of 50.7 million in 1995.</p>
