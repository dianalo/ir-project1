<p>A draft plan by India to pay state and private sector oil companies international market prices for crude pumped from Indian oilfields will apply only to new fields, a government spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>The official spokesperson for the department of Petroleum and Natural Gas was clarifying comments made by a senior ministry official about a draft proposal for a new exploration licence policy. Asked which fields the new price policy would apply to, she said: "It is for the new ones."  </p>
<p>The new exploration policy, which the senior official said would be announced within two months, is aimed at allowing state oil companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd  compete on an equal footing with private sector companies, by paying them the same price for their crude.</p>
<p>"The main highlights of this new exploration licence policy are national oil companies like ONGC and OIL will be able to compete with private companies securing petroleum exploration licences," the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>"(It will create a) level playing field for the national oil companies, particularly by paying them international market prices for oil. The crude price that the government pays these companies will be the same as the international market price of oil."</p>
<p>Asked which oilfields the new pricing regime would apply to, the spokesperson said: "For the new fields that will be awarded after this exploration licence policy comes into effect."</p>
<p>Domestic crude is currently priced by the government at around $11 to $12 a barrel compared to $22 to $23 on international markets.</p>
<p>ONGC accounts for 90 percent of India's oil and gas production.</p>
