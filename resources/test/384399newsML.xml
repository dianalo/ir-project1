<p>Bulgaria's interim transport minister said on Tuesday he expected the country's severe fuel crisis to improve by the end of the week following a drastic hike of petrol prices.</p>
<p>The interim government raised petrol prices by up to 178 percent on Tuesday in a bid to free suppliers' volumes kept in storage.</p>
<p>"I hope that the fuel, which is held back (by suppliers) will appear on the market...and by the end of the week we expect that the situation will be normal," Wilhelm Kraus told a news conference.</p>
<p>Kraus said more than 40 transport firms in the country had no fuel and the cabinet had discussed on Monday a possibility for releasing some from the state reserve.</p>
<p>Most petrol stations in the country have been closed because of the shortage.</p>
<p>Municipalities are distributing petrol and diesel for ambulances, food delivery trucks, the police, the army and social services, officials said. Bus transport in towns has been strongly reduced causing problems for industry, they added.</p>
<p>Shell Bulgaria, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group subsidiary and the only foreign fuel retailer in Bulgaria, exclusively supplied by the Neftochim refinery in Bourgas, said all its 23 petrol stations were dry.</p>
<p>"Our last fuel supplies were on February 8," Shell Bulgaria spokeswoman Kamelia Slaveikova told Reuters.</p>
<p>Petar Tsanov, deputy director of the biggest state-owned fuel retailer, Petrol, said the firm, which had 450 filling stations in the country, was receiving 150 tonnes of fuel per day while it needed 1,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>"The problem is in Neftochim's crude supplies and I expect that they will be regulated in two weeks," Tsanov said, adding that even if private firms freed stocks it would not be sufficient.</p>
<p>The cash-stripped Bourgas refinery, which has been refining up to 9,000 tonnes of crude per day down from 22,000 tonnes in December, needs credits to ensure crude supplies, officials said.</p>
<p>The refinery, Bulgaria's only domestic supplier, said on Tuesday it would increase output by up to 400 tonnes per day to 1,500 tonnes of petrol and 1,000 tonnes of diesel.</p>
<p>It owes millions of dollars to its crude suppliers, and has 52,400 tonnes of crude on stock.</p>
<p>Neftochim expects a 61,500-tonne tanker from a private firm Yukos Bulgaria to arrive later on Tuesday at the Bourgas port from Odessa, Neftochim's spokeswoman Tatyana Hadzhieva said.</p>
<p>Last week the interim government, which inherited crippling fuel and grain shortages, banned fuel exports until April 30 and troops enforced border controls in a bid to curb oil smuggling.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stefan Sofianski announced on Friday plans for partial privatisation of the debt-ridden Neftochim refinery, but gave no further details.</p>
