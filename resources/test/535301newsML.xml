<p>Panama's banana exports fell nearly 10 percent during the first quarter compared with the same period in 1996 and the downward trend is expected to continue due to damaging import quotas from the European Union, a government official said Thursday.</p>
<p>Panama exported 7.3 million 18.14-kg boxes from January to March, down from 8.1 million during the same period last year, Euclides Diaz, a Commerce Ministry's director, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"We're seeing a reduction now and it is expected to continue," he said. "What is affecting us most is the restrictive regimen of the European Union."</p>
<p>Panama's banana exports to Europe have dropped ever since the EU imposed in 1993 an import quota of 2.5 million tonnes a year from Latin America. World Trade Organization (WTO) officials are expected to discuss the quota issue later this year, Dias said.</p>
<p>From 41 million 18.14-kg boxes exported annually before the introduction of the quota, the figure has dropped to around 36 million and Diaz said it could fall to 35 million this year.</p>
<p>"Before the quota, 80 percent of Panama's banana exports went to Europe," Diaz said.</p>
<p>Since 1993, Panama has seen a significant drop from Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway. "Panama represented 50 percent of banana imports there, now we barely represent 20 percent."</p>
<p>Panama's agriculture sector accounts for about 15 percent of Gross Domestic Product, experts said. GDP grew to about $8.5 billion last year, up from $8.2 billion in 1995.</p>
