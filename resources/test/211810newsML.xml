<p>Malaysia's national oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) said its exploration arm had finished drilling a tri-lateral horizontal well, believed to be the first of its kind in the world.</p>
<p>In a statement on Thursday, Petronas said the well, drilled by exploration unit Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd in the Bokor field off the east Malaysian state of Sarawak, has branches of three horizontal wells that were drilled from a single main trunk.</p>
<p>Each branch was designed to drain an individual reservoir, enabling production of more oil at a lower cost, it said.</p>
<p>"It will not only improve project profitability but also make development of small fields attractive. This is indeed the well of the future," Petronas president and chief executive Mohd Hassan Marican said in the statement.</p>
<p>He said Petronas could apply the technology to developing its oilfields, reducing the number of wells required to produce oil, which would lead to smaller offshore platforms.</p>
<p>"This will enable us to further reduce project costs and environmental impact on our activities," Mohd Hassan said.</p>
