<p>Two Russian cosmonauts aboard Mir made final preparations on Wednesday to return to Earth after one of the most gruelling missions in the space station's history, officials said.</p>
<p>Commander Vasily Tsibliyev and engineer Alexander Lazutkin have faced a series of major challenges since they came aboard in February, the most serious of which was a June 25 collision between Mir and its resupply ship. Mir has run on partial power since then.</p>
<p>"Their main task today is to prepare the equipment and capsule for their return," said Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for Mission Control outside Moscow.</p>
<p>They plan to enter a Soyuz capsule at 9:50 a.m. (0550 GMT) on Thursday, undock at 12:53 (0853 GMT) and land at 4:16 p.m. (1216 GMT) in a remote region of the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. They will return to the Moscow region that night.</p>
<p>Their two replacement Russian cosmonauts, commander Anatoly Solovyov and engineer Pavel Vinogradov, as well as NASA astronaut Michael Foale, also prepared on Wednesday to fly their escape capsule to another docking port on Mir, Lyndin said.</p>
<p>During that 45-minute operation planned for Friday the crew will also take photos of the damaged Spektr module, which suffered a puncture in the June accident and, airless, is now sealed off from the rest of the space station.</p>
<p>The new crew has already had a taste of some of the repair difficulties that lie ahead. Efforts to restart either of two Elektron oxygen generating systems have failed, and frustrated engineers are now devising a method to clean out a blocked system pipe in the newer main Elektron with a mixture of aspirin and water, NASA said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the crew is relying on a back-up system of oxygen "candles".</p>
<p>NASA also highlighted the problem of Mir's dwindling drinking water supply on Tuesday, a problem caused earlier in the year by leaking anti-freeze from cooling systems.</p>
<p>Mir's "urine reclamation system", which purifies the station's water, has been off to save power. Tsibliyev and Lazutkin will bring back samples from the system when they return to Earth on Thursday.</p>
<p>NASA said the U.S. space shuttle bringing a relief astronaut for Foale, David Wolf, would also carry more water. It has tentatively scheduled a September 27 blast-off.</p>
<p>After Tsibliyev and Lazutkin depart, the remaining crew will intensify preparations for a risky operation planned for August 20 to restore power from the solar panels on Spektr.</p>
