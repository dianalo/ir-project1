<title>LUXEMBOURG: Court limits France's tariffs on "departements".</title>
<headline>Court limits France's tariffs on "departements".</headline>
<dateline>LUXEMBOURG 1996-11-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Court of Justice ruled on Thursday that the EC Treaty does not permit a member state to place a unilateral tariff on goods coming from outside the European Union, unless the tariff was in place prior to 1968.</p>
<p>French plaintiffs importing goods into French overseas "departments" challenged additional duty (droit additionnel) and dock dues (octroi de mer) charged on goods from both in and outside of the EU as incompatible with the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The French Tribunal d'Instance agreed with the plaintiffs that duties levied on goods from other member states were illegal, but permitted duties on goods from outside the Community to stand.</p>
<p>The European court found all the tariffs in violation of the EC Treaty, unless the tariffs fell under a special agreement, or were in place prior to 1968, when the Common Customs Tariff was introduced.</p>
<p>"It is for the national court, in order to determine whether the contested charge is to be categorized as an existing charge, to compare the rules applicable to it with those which would have been applicable on 1 July 1968," the court said.</p>
<p>The court limited the effect of this judgment to claims made for dock dues or additional levies paid subsequent to July 16, 1992, the date the court issued its judgment in Administration des Douanes et Droits Indirects v Legros and Others (1992) ECR I-4625.</p>
<p>"As regards the period subsequent to 16 July 1992, the French government could not reasonably continue to believe, in light of the judgments...that it was consistent with Community law to levy, in respect of goods from non-member countries which are not linked to the Community by a special agreement, either the "droit additionnel" or the "octroi de mer"...." the court said.</p>

<p>Case C-125/94</p>
<p>Reference by the Tribunal d'Instance, Paris XII, for a preliminary ruling in the proceedings pending before that court between</p>
<p>Societe Cadi Surgeles</p>
<p>Societe Sofrigu</p>
<p>Societe Sofroi</p>
<p>Societe Sofriber</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Ministre des Finances</p>
<p>Directeur General dees Douanes</p>
<p>on the interpretation of articles 9, 12, 113 and 227(2) of the EEC Treaty, now the EC Treaty</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>THE COURT hereby rules</p>
<p>1. It is incompatible with the EEC Treaty, now the EC Treaty, to levy a customs duty or a charge having equivalent effect which has been unilaterally introduced by a member state after the introduction of the Common Customs Tariff on 1 July 1968 on goods imported directly from non-member countries which are not linked to the Community by a special agreement. However, the Treaty does not preclude the levying of a charge having equivalent effect to a customs duty on imports which, having regard to all its essential characteristics, must be regarded as a charge already in existence on 1 July 1968, provided that the level at which it is levied has not been raised. Where the level has been raised, only the amount by which it has been raised must be regarded as incompatible with the Treaty.</p>
<p>2. The Treaty provisions relating to customs duties and charges having equivalent effect cannot be relied upon in support of claims for the reimbursement of sums levied before 16 July 1992 by way of "droit additionnel" on goods from non-member countries which are not linked to the Community by a special agreement, except by claimants who have initiated legal proceedings or raised an equivalent claim before that date. This also applies to sums levied on such goods before that date by way of "octroi de mer" to the extent that the levying of such sums is declared unlawful in application of this judgment.</p>
