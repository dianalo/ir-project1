<p>Clean tanker rates were rather lacklustre on Friday with the only signs of strength in the key Middle East region which saw rates to the east rising, brokers said.</p>
<p>"The only firm region that I can see is the AG," one said, and assessed rates for 55,000 tonne vessels at W185-190 to Asia.</p>
<p>Good demand for naphtha from South Korea and Japan had supported rates, he said, and added that suitable ships were in short supply for the month. Middle East-India routes were assessed at around W180-185 for 42,000 tonne vessels, while 30,000 tonners were valued closer to 230-235.</p>
<p>While shipowners had less grounds for optimism in the Caribbean in the short term, with rates for 30,000 tonne vessels slipping down to around W205, rates may rise later in the month.</p>
<p>"There are still some import requirements there so I guess it could jump 60 points in the next two weeks."</p>
<p>Cross-Mediterranean rates were also lower at around W205-215 for 30,000 tonne naphtha vessels. Few stems were seen for November but brokers said they though business was likely to pick up next month.</p>
<p>Inter/UKContinent markets were weak, with two 20,000 tonne vessels fixed at W210 and W225.</p>
