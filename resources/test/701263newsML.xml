<p>Railtrack Plc said on Thursday that its windfall tax exposure could be as high as 160 million stg, according to latest estimates.</p>
<p>The rail infrastructure group raised its figure for the potential hit from an original estimated range of between 80 million and 135 million stg.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the group told Reuters "We now think it is likely to be closer to the 160 million (stg) mark." He added that "borrowing will have to increase" to allow Railtrack to meet the tax liability.  </p>
<p>The group said it would have to borrow to cover part of the cost of the levy, but did not elaborate further.</p>
<p>Commenting on Railtrack's inclusion in the list of companies liable for the Labour government's tax on privatised utilities, the group spokesman told Reuters "We were disappointed to be in there. We were only privatised 15 months ago. But we will simply pay the bill and get on with it."  </p>
<p>Asked whether the tax would impact on Railtrack's spending plans, the spokesman said "We are committed to spending 16 billion (stg) over 10 years. We will utilise the borrowing arrangements available and work with the government to achieve that programme."</p>
