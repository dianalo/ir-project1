<p>British and Chinese negotiators have reached agreement in Beijing settling a four-year dispute over Hong Kong's ninth container terminal (CT9), Hong Kong Radio said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The agreement was signed in Beijing on Thursday, and construction was expected to begin early next year, Radio Television Hong Kong said.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government has called a news conference for 5.15 pm (0915 GMT) to announce details of the agreement.</p>
<p>Government officials from relevant departments will attend along with representatives from the private-sector companies involved in the negotiations, a government statement said.</p>
<p>Development of Hong Kong's ninth container port has been held up for four years by Chinese objections to the way the contract was awarded and to the presence of the Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd group in the consortium.</p>
<p>Beijing refused to give the project its approval, needed because the contract straddles Hong Kong's handover to Chinese sovereignty next year, citing the lack of an open tender.</p>
<p>After protracted negotiations, China agreed in January to accept the award of the contract in line with the wishes of the companies involved.</p>
