<p>Minor Metals Inc's bid in the latest cobalt offering by U.S. Defense National Stockpile Center was thrown out because it included conditions to the bid, which are prohibited in sealed Stockpile bids, the agency's top executive said.</p>
<p>"Their bid was deemed non-responsive," said Richard Connelly, Stockpile administrator. "There are no provisions in a sealed bid."</p>
<p>Minor Metals bid $18.88 a lb for 80,378 lbs but attached a provision to the bid that required the Stockpile to have the Minor Metals Trade Association verify the quality of 100 percent of the cobalt offered for sale and offered to pick up the cost of the analysis of the cobalt. The provision also called for a refund if the cobalt didn't meet the specifications of the sampling.</p>
<p>Beginning with this latest offering of 500,000 lbs, which opened Wednesday, the Stockpile agreed to have MMTA sample 25 percent of the cobalt offering but retained its "no-warranty no-guarantee" policy. Previously, the Stockpile used its own internal analysis.</p>
<p>"Although (the 25 percent MMTA sampling) is an improvement, it still leaves a buyer exposed on the balance 75 percent unsampled material," Minor Metals' president Rami Weisfisch wrote in an open letter to the Stockpile.</p>
<p>"We hope the DNSC will appreciate that practically no buyer (consumer, producer, trader) in the world is prepared to buy cobalt metal without having a quality guarantee or, as a minimum, having the ability to sample the material first," Weisfisch wrote.</p>
<p>He wasn't available to comment on the nullification of his bid.</p>
<p>The next highest bidder was Powmet, which bid $18.8615 a lb.</p>
