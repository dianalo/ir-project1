<p>A Middle East economic conference ended in Cairo on Thursday with the message that prosperity in the region was within grasp, if only peace talks between Israel and its Arab neighbours could make progress.</p>
<p>"If you lose peace, everyone will be the loser. If we put the peace process back on track, everyone will gain," Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri told the closing session.</p>
<p>"People are asking what is the alternative if peace fails. If those who hold the keys do not remove the doubts, everyone will lose," added Klaus Schwab, president of the World Economic Forum, the organiser of the three-day conference.</p>
<p>More than 2,500 delegates from 92 countries took part in the conference, which concentrated on regional economic cooperation and economic reform in individual countries.</p>
<p>But the stalemate in Middle East peace talks hung heavy over the meeting and shifted the focus away from the goal at previous conferences in Casablanca and Amman -- underpinning peace by integrating Israel into the region.</p>
<p>"How can you ask Egypt and the Arab states to go ahead with regional cooperation in this situation now?" asked Ganzouri.</p>
<p>But he ended on a more optimistic note: "It may be just a summer cloud. There may be problems now but we still look forward to cooperation to put ourselves on the world map."</p>
<p>In an overview of economic prospects, presented on Thursday, the World Bank said the region could achieve annual economic growth of up to six percent if reforms continued to gain speed.</p>
<p>"It would be less than frank to deny that we meet today at a time of some political uncertainty in the region," said Kemal Dervis, World Bank vice president for the region.</p>
<p>"But it would equally be less than fair to deny that we are meeting at a time when the countries of the region...are beginning to make real progress in creating an economically New Middle East and North Africa," he added.</p>
<p>In a formal Cairo declaration, the participants called for quick implementation of Israeli-Palestinian agreements and an end to Israel's closure of the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>The three-page declaration did not specifically blame Israel for the economic hardships of Palestinians or say explicitly that a settlement should be based on exchanging land for peace.</p>
<p>It said the participants were committed to peace on the terms of reference of the Madrid peace conference in 1991 and U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, which Arabs understand to mean land for peace. The Israeli government does not agree.</p>
<p>"They underlined the utmost importance of the faithful and expeditious implementation of those agreements by all parties in particular on the Israeli-Palestinian track," it said.</p>
<p>"They reiterated that removing restrictive measures and closures will prevent the decline of, and contribute positively to the performance of, the Palestinian economy," it added.</p>
<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa openly attacked Israel for hypocrisy at a closing news conference, saying it preached free trade while denying it to the Palestinians.</p>
<p>"It's contradictory. If the borders are not opened around the Palestinians, then those who don't open them do not deserve that others open up to them. The international community should not be silent about this," he said.</p>
<p>Schwab and Moussa said that during the conference businessmen and governments reached deals worth a total of $10 billion but they did not give details of them.</p>
<p>The biggest one publicised was a memorandum of understanding on exports of Egyptian liquefied natural gas to Turkey. The project will cost between $2 billion and $4 billion.</p>
<p>Moussa said the Cairo conference had succeeded in putting regional cooperation into perspective, shifting the focus away from integrating Israel into the Middle East economy.</p>
<p>"Arab-Arab cooperation is the backbone. That doesn't exclude cooperation with others under the right conditions but we don't want any one country to be the centre," he said.</p>
<p>"Peace has conditions, fulfil them. Otherwise there will not be peace, however many deals are signed," he added.</p>
<p>But Israeli Finance Minister Dan Meridor said the political climate had little effect on contacts with Arab participants.</p>
<p>"We go home quite satisfied. In spite of some early remarks which were not very welcoming to Israel, the reality we found here in the halls, in the corridors, in the meetings, was very positive," he told a news conference.</p>
