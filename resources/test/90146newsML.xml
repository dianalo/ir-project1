<p>The spread between peak and off-peak power prices in the western U.S. will narrow between now and December as nighttime heating demand picks up and daytime cooling loads decrease, market sources said.</p>
<p>"The nights are getting longer and cooler, but on-peak loads are leveling off," said a western Canadian trader.</p>
<p>Peak hours are generally defined as weekday daylight hours, while off-peak periods are at night and weekends.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Bonneville Power Administration raised its next-day offer price for firm off-peak power to $16.00 per megawatt hour (MWh), compared with $13.00 a week earlier.</p>
<p>Over the same period the Portland, Ore.-based federal agency raised prices for heavy load hours by just $1.00 per MWh to $21.00.</p>
<p>After implementing on Tuesday a new pricing structure which separates transmission from generation, the spread between BPA's peak and off-peak prices for Northwest deliveries stood at just $2.50 and at $4.50 for northern California border deliveries.</p>
<p>"What happens is the thermal plants come up and loads come up along with them," explained a Northwest trader.</p>
<p>"The water starts to diminish so there is less pressure to unload (hydroelectric power) into the off-peak market. There is enough load so people are able to shape hydro into on-peak."</p>
<p>The spread in June between BPA's peak and off-peak offers stood at $7.00, down from as wide as $10.00 in January.</p>
<p>"In December the on-peak prices will start to rise again. By then it is cold around the clock," said the Calgary trader.</p>
