<p>Mexico's oil and gas monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) hired the Energy Ministry's strategy chief to head its petrochemial operations, Pemex said in a statement late Monday.</p>
<p>Raul Livas Elizondo currently heads the policy unit and energy programs at the Energy Ministry. The M.I.T. graduate, who also holds a doctorate in economics, has helped orchestrate the controversial privatization of Pemex's 10 petrochemical plants.</p>
<p>His first task will likely be the final presentation to the public of the long-delayed sale, promised by the ministry to be ready in the coming weeks. Private companies have been invited to buy a minority stake in existing secondary petrochemical plants, and fully own any new plants.</p>
<p>In recent months the ministry has separated seven of the largest plants from Pemex, with just Reynosa, Independencia and  Salamanca remaining, Livas told Reuters earlier this month. Once the companies are established as entities separated from Pemex they will be available for up to a 49 percent stake sale.</p>
<p>Livas replaces engineer Luis Puig Lara, who will head Mexico's second largest petrochemical plant La Cangrejera.</p>
