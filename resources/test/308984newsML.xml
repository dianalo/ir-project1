<p>Massachusetts Gov. William Weld on Wednesday proposed raising the tax deduction for children under 12 years old by $1,000, which would let about 400,000 taxpayers save $96 a year.</p>
<p>Further, the governor called for increasing by $47 million, or 65 percent, funding for the state's child care program and early childhood education.  </p>
<p>The amount that Masachusetts parents of children who are under 12 years old could deduct would rise to $1,600 if the legislature agreed with Weld's proposal. The level has not been increased since it first went into place in 1976, and the raise was calculated to adjust for inflation during that period as well as the higher costs of parenting.</p>
<p>"These two initiatives offer well-deserved relief for working families, who are already suffocated by an overwhelming tax burden and by the high costs of raising children," Weld said, in prepared remarks.</p>
<p>The extra funds for childcare programs includes $25 million for 2,500 new day care slots, giving the state a total of 41,100 openings.</p>
