<p>Spot gold in Asia remained dogged by volatility as the precious metals fed off each others' fluctuations and physical demand waited in the sidelines, Asian dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>"People are very bullish on one (precious metal) because the other one is higher, or very bearish because the other is also coming off, it's all fairly volatile," said Anderson Cheung, chief dealer at Swiss Bank Corp in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Short term platinum lease rates jumped to about six percent early Thursday, with Swiss houses seen big borrowers, but short term palladium lease rates were said still firm around 8-10 percent for one month and six to eight percent for three months. "The platinum group metals (PGMs)have seen huge borrowing interest in the one to three month period, which has put palladium and platinum into backwardation," said one dealer in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>PGM futures ended higher Thursday on news suggesting Russia may change its PGM marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Gold in Hong Kong opened on Friday at US$341.80/342.30 per ounce, down from New York's overnight close and punters were unwilling to take positions in a bearish market.</p>
<p>The options markets saw more aggressive bidding for out-of- the-money puts in the short term and in the one year period, an options trader in Hong Kong said.</p>
<p>"They're looking to the downside," he said.</p>
<p>Physical demand had not provided much support, traders in Hong Kong and Singapore said.</p>
<p>"Physical gold is a little bit quiet, people bought too much at about $345 per ounce and demand is very slow when (prices) came off to $342-$343 per ounce," Swiss Bank Corp's Cheung said. Over the medium term, gold prices appeared to have bottomed out and should firm in the coming weeks, but physical demand continued to sputter and rose only marginally when the yellow metal fell below US$340 an ounce, dealers in Singapore said late on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Demand has improved, but not as much as I had expected," a senior dealer for a financial institution in Singapore said.</p>
<p>Some traders said one reason why demand was not reignited by the sharp fall in gold prices was due to the seasonal lull in gold demand in April.</p>
<p>"In fact, it's pretty surprising but gold demand in Vietnam and Malaysia was pretty weak," another Singapore dealer said.</p>
<p>Most of the trade said gold prices have stabilised and should trade in a range between $342-$346 an ounce over the next few weeks, with gains capped at between $345 and $346 per ounce.</p>
<p>Traders said gold had strong support as $340-$342 and would hold at those levels.</p>
<p>Singapore gold premiums over spot London prices inched up slightly to 90-120 U.S. cents an ounce from last week's 80-110 U.S. cents, mainly due to a slight uptick in demand, dealers said.</p>
