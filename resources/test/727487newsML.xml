<p>SBC Warburg said on Monday the A$100 million note issue it lead managed for Arnotts Ltd from its A$200 million debt programme were priced at 32 basis points over the Commonwealth Government July 2000 bond.</p>
<p>The issue yield was 5.99 percent, SBC Warburg said. The notes pay a 5.75 percent coupon and mature August 15, 2000. Settlement is on July 17.  </p>
<p>When the issue was announced last week, the notes were to carry a 6.0 percent coupon.</p>
<p>SBC Warburg Executive Director, rates, Ron Ogden said the coupon was dropped as the issue yield was coming in under 6.0 percent, reflecting the recent strength of the bond market.</p>
<p>"It was just coming in under the six percent, so we decided, with Arnotts, to drop the coupon to get it to a price discount," Ogden told Reuters.</p>
<p>Ogden said SBC and Arnotts were "absolutley delighted" with the issue.  </p>
<p>"It's gone extremely well. There's definitely a hole in people's portfolios for well-rated corporate names. This is just an absolute winner for them," he said.</p>
<p>This is the first issue undertaken by Arnotts, which is rated AA-minus by Standard &amp; Poor's, and is also the most highly rated non-government owned corporate bond launched in Australia to date, SBC Warburg said when the issue was announced.</p>
<p>The full A$100 million were issued, and SBC said there was good demand for the notes.  </p>
<p>"We were well-oversubscribed on our ticket, and I dare say the other dealers were much the same, so there's definitely good demand out there for this sort of paper," Ogden said.</p>
<p>Arnotts is about 70 percent onwed by Campbell Soup Co .</p>
<p>Co-managers for the issue are Westpac Banking Corporation, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Citisecurities Ltd. SBC Warburg is also arranger of the debt programme.</p>
