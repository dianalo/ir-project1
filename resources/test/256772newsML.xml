<p>Ministers from 128 nations hammered out last-minute deals on Friday to seal a sweeping pact to free commerce in information technology, help the poor and set the agenda of world trade talks for the rest of the century.</p>
<p>An eleventh-hour agreement to boost the world's 48 poorest countries ensured passage of a ministerial declaration that crowned the final day of the inaugural December 9-13 meeting of the fledgling World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>"The ministerial conference has been an outstanding event in all respects," Singapore's trade minister Yeo Cheow Tong, the chairman of conference, said to applause from fellow ministers as he wrapped up a week of intense negotations.</p>
<p>The eight-page declaration adopted at the closing session forms a blueprint for the future agenda of the WTO, including working groups to study the links between trade, competition and cross-border investment.</p>
<p>"I regard it as astonishing that we've been able to bring together such a diverse group of countries and get agreement on a text that is not just papering over the cracks but genuinely important," European Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan told a news conference.</p>
<p>The conference, with its ground-breaking Information Technology Agreement (ITA) to scrap tariffs on the rapidly growing $600 billion world market in computer-related goods, had boosted the strength and profile of the trade body, he said.</p>
<p>"We regard the conference as having been a huge international success which has given vital boost to the strength and profile of the World Trade Organisation," Brittan said.</p>
<p>Ministers and economists said the ITA would give a powerful boost to the information-technology industry, especially in Asia, and eventually lead to lower prices for a vast range of consumer goods that use electronic parts.</p>
<p>But delegates said the triumph of clinching an IT pact, which about 30 countries were expected to sign on Friday, would had been tarnished without agreement on the conference's other main agenda item -- the link between trade and labour standards.</p>
<p>A hard-fought compromise emerged late on Thursday that had just enough to enable North and South to proclaim victory.</p>
<p>"We got everything," WTO Director General Renato Ruggiero said late on Thursday, as he emerged tired but happy after days of round-the-clock negotiations.</p>
<p>Developing nations, led by India, Pakistan and Egypt, had refused to countenance any interference by the WTO in the area of workers' rights, fearing it would undermine their chief comparative advantage in world trade -- cheap labour.</p>
<p>The United States and a string of European countries, by contrast, were equally insistent in clamouring for action to help 250 million child workers, mainly in the Third World, and to improve sweatshop conditions.</p>
<p>The final declaration satisfies poor countries because it firmly rejects the use of labour standards for protectionist purposes and says the International Labour Organisation, based like the WTO in Geneva, is the competent body to deal with them.</p>
<p>"I think that the agreements on labour standards does mark a breakthrough in the worldwide dialogue on this delicate but vital subject," Brittan said. "We have put our foot in the door."</p>
<p>Washington can point to a commitment in the declaration to observe internationally recognised labour standards and to a promise of continued collaboration between the WTO and the ILO.</p>
<p>"If the Americans hadn't got an agreement on labour, they couldn't have gone back to Washington," a Japanese official said.</p>
<p>A last-minute surprise was agreement on an action plan to boost trade with the world's least developed countries.</p>
<p>The move would help the world's 48 poorest nations to improve their capacity to respond to the opportunities offered by the trading system, ministers said.</p>
<p>"One of the things of which the European Union can be most proud is our ability to snatch victory out of the jaws of defeat at the last minute on issue of helping the least developed countries," Brittan said.</p>
<p>Next year's objective must be to grant to the poorest countries duty-free access to the markets of all developed and more advanced developing countries and, as appropriate, to the markets of other developing countries, he said.</p>
