<p>Rinascente's share capital on July 23 was equal to 292.1 billion lire, with 206.492 million ordinary shares, 37.2 million privileged shares and 48.368 savings shares, all at a nominal value of 1,000 lire.</p>
<p>The capital increase includes the issue of ordinary shares and savings shares linked to a 4.5 percent Mediobanca bond 1997-2000 with warrants on Rinascente shares.</p>
