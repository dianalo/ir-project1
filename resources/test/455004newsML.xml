<p>NWE oil products all firmed on Wednesday after crude extended late Tuesday's gains, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gasoline rose by around $4 a tonne. Winter Eurograde traded at $214 fob, summer Eurograde at $213, $214 and $215. Late morning offers for summer grade were at around $217 fob Rotterdam.</p>
<p>The buoyant prompt physical market led to a $2 backwardation between April and May swaps.</p>
<p>Physical regular gasoline traded at $208.</p>
<p>Heating oil barges were up some $4 a tonne, but were very thinly traded. Some wholesalers with short positions, however, were more keen to discuss trade but were little interested in offers which held at IPE April -$1 fob ARA.</p>
<p>High sulphur fuel oil barges traded once at $90 fob Rotterdam. The trading house that has bought the market at steadily higher levels in the past week was, for once, the seller.</p>
<p>Bunker market demand remained low, somewhat below 10,000 tonnes.</p>
