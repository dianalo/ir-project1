<title>USA: CSCE cocoa ends higher in lightly traded session.</title>

<p>CSCE cocoa futures ended higher in thin dealings on Tuesday, bolstered by light speculative interest and industry-linked buying, market sources said.</p>
<p>After pulling back for two sessions in a row, traders said the market was due for a technical correction. Prices headed higher at the opening and stayed in positive territory for the remainder of the session.</p>
<p>Traders said a downturn in the U.S. dollar against the British pound also buoyed CSCE cocoa, as arbitrage favored cheaper prices on the dollar-denominated New York market.</p>
<p>"Industry was taking adavantage of the break in prices," said one trader. "And the weaker dollar helped New York a little."</p>
<p>May futures rose $17 a tonne on the day, to $1,445, having traded from $1,451 to $1,430. May gained $11, to $1,471, while the remaining months were up $9 to $12.</p>
<p>Traders said upward momentum picked up after the key May contract broke through near-term chart resistance at $1,440 a tonne and triggered buy-stops.</p>
<p>But scattered scale-up selling by the trade trimmed gains and kept May below its next level of resistance at $1,453, they added.</p>
<p>Technically, traders said a breach of $1,453 basis May contract could lead to a test of $1,460-$1,463. On the downside, near-term support was seen around today's low of $1,430.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, traders said views were mixed. While some dealers said an anticipated global cocoa deficit in 1996/97 and strong consumption should provide support for prices, other dealers said arrival figures out of the Ivory Coast could point to a larger-than-expected harvest from the world's number one producer.</p>
<p>"Consumption has been excellent," said Rich Wistisen, an analysts with Commodity Information in Orem, Utah. "But Ivorian arrivals are already up near one million tonnes and the mid-crop is developing well."</p>
<p>Wistisen said the 1996/97 Ivorian harvest is likely to be close to last season's record yield of 1.2 million tonnes. Many analysts have forecast a 1996/97 Ivory Coast crop of over one million tonnes, but the Ivorian Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze said earlier this month the total harvest was likely to be less than one million tonnes.</p>
<p>The day's volume reached an estimated 5,108 lots, down from Monday's official tally of 7,600 lots.</p>
