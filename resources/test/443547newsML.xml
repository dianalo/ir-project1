<p>Istanbul shares ended barely lower on Friday as sentiment was mixed amid Moody's downgrading of Turkey's currency ceiling and political optimism gripping the market after Thursday's cabinet meeting, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100 closed at 1,499, down five points, or 0.33 percent from Thursday when it leapt 4.66 percent on a cabinet decision to carry out measures to combat Islamist activism in line with the demands of the secularist military.</p>
<p>Trade volume jumped to 32 trillion lira from Thursday's 25.5 trillion.</p>
<p>"Positive effects of the political developments and the negative effects of the Moody's rate cut clashed all day," said Ugur Yegin from Korfez investment.</p>
<p>"The market has recently gone through all sorts of bad expectations and news, so from now on, possible economic implementations by the government may trigger a rise," he added.</p>
<p>Over the week, the index rose 3.88 percent, mainly due to Thursday's jump, after last week's 10.5 percent plunge caused by political tension which had mounted due to a row between the coalition's Islamist wing and the army.</p>
<p>Of the 237 shares traded, 101 advanced, 87 declined and 49 closed steady. The IMKB Industrial firmed 0.59 percent to 1,541, the IMKB Services eased 0.29 percent to 1,370 and the IMKB Financial lost 1.39 percent to 1,559.</p>
<p>Top actives were largely state owned oil refiner Tupras, up 5,000 lira at 63,000 and Turkish Airlines, up 1,000 lira at 37,500, communication equipment maker Alcatel Teletas, up 500 lira at 17,750 and leading car producer Tofas, steady at 8,000 lira.</p>
<p>They made up 23.6 percent of the total turnover.</p>
