<p>An Iowa corn and soybean producer predicted farmers would plant "lots more Bt corn" because of the potential for higher yields.</p>
<p>In a speech to the U.S. Agriculture Department's annual Agricultural Outlook conference, producer Alan Karkosh of K&amp;O Farms Inc said Bt corn also provides season-long control for the corn borer.</p>
<p>"I believe Bt corn has the potential to increase and stabilize our average corn yields," the Hudson, Iowa-based farmer said.  </p>
<p>Novartis AG's "Bt corn" is genetically engineered to resist the European corn borer by producing a natural toxin against the insect.</p>
<p>He did not see any big yield gains for Roundup Ready soybeans, made by Monsanto Co, saying the Roundup Ready system produced only about two bushels per acre more than other herbicide programs.</p>
<p>"Roundup Ready soybeans will not increase yields in the near future. However, they do have the potential to increase profits per acre by reducing costs," the farmer said in his speech.</p>
<p>He predicted acreage in the Midwest corn/soybean states would become more consistent from year to year as many farmers moved to a 50/50 crop rotation.</p>
