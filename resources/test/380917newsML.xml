<p>Afghanistan's purist Islamic Taleban are expelling people with untidy hair, without beards or smoking cigarettes from the army and government ministries.</p>
<p>A special commission has been set up to purify the army and ministries and bring them into line with the Taleban's strict interpretation of sharia, the Islamic legal code.</p>
<p>"The commission investigated those who had not observed sharia law. Those with dishevelled hair, without beards, or smoking cigarettes were interrogated and expelled from the ranks of the armed forces and disarmed," said an announcement on Taleban-controlled Sharia Radio in Kabul on Friday night.</p>
<p>The commission started work on Wednesday from the Ariana Hotel in central Kabul. Outside the hotel gates piles of hair lay in the dust.</p>
<p>Local inhabitants of at least two of Kabul's districts said Taleban fighters were stopping civilians in the street and cutting their hair on the spot.</p>
<p>The Taleban insist that government servants grow their beards and keep their hair short. A number of government employees have already been removed from their posts for breaking the edict.</p>
<p>According to the radio report, the commission is also expelling under-age fighters from the armed forces and sending them to religious schools for further education.</p>
<p>"The team identified those who have not reached legal age and were acting irresponsibly. Their service was discontinued and they have been sent to religious schools for education." said the report.</p>
<p>According to a senior Taleban official, the clean-up was necessary because undesirable elements had joined the Taleban as they took over the country.</p>
<p>"As the area under Taleban control grew, more people joined the movement, some of them with bad intentions. This has led to an outbreak of corruption and therefore the Taleban felt the need to clean up the movement." Mullah Enayatullah Baligh told journalists on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Taleban, who control almost 80 per cent of Afghanistan, have vowed to impose their vision of Islamic law on the whole country.</p>
<p>In the areas they control they have reintroduced Islamic punishments such as the amputation of limbs for theft, stoning for adultery, and whipping for what they consider immodest dress.</p>
