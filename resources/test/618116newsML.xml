<headline>European precious metal markets look to steady day.</headline>

<p>Dealers were looking for precious metals markets to consolidate on Tuesday after a quiet start to the week when the London and U.S. markets were closed for a holiday.</p>
<p>Gold was indicated at $343.80/$343.30, unchanged from Friday and barely moved from Monday's trading in Europe.</p>
<p>Early business was quiet and dealers forecast that it would hold narrowly around current prices.</p>
<p>Silver was also barely changed following its short-covering rally late on Friday and a quiet day on Monday. Consolidation around $4.70 was expected, which would be about four-six cents below Friday's close.</p>
<p>Platinum and palladium were both steady, with the former forming a base either side of $390.00 and palladium at $171.00/$172.00.</p>
