<p>An unexpected outage of a Maine nuclear generating station on Wednesday bolstered prices in the wholesale electricity market in the northeastern U.S., market sources said.</p>
<p>"It was definitely up," said one Houston trader, referring to today's rise.</p>
<p>The 910 megawatt Maine Yankee nuclear power plant in Wiscasset, Maine, tripped off line today during testing. The plant was running at 90 percent of capacity before the shutdown. Maine Yankee officials said they would need 24 hours to decide whether to bring the unit back on line.  </p>
<p>Generation capacity in the Northeast has been tight due to the idling of a number of power plants for seasonal maintenance.</p>
<p>In addition to less units running, power from Canada has been limited in recent days because of firmer heating demand in Quebec and transmission limitations, traders said.</p>
<p>"It's just been tight up there. The ties to NEPOOL (New England Power Pool) are loaded up," said a Northeast trader.</p>
<p>Next-day NEPOOL electricity for peak, non-firm delivery to Northeast Utilities' territory was quoted at $31.00-$33.00 a megawatt hour (MWh), higher than Tuesday's $28.50-$29.50.  </p>
<p>Off-peak, non-firm NEPOOL power for Thursday delivery at the NU border was assessed at $19.75-$22.00, up from Tuesday's $19.50.</p>
<p>In the New York Power Pool (NYPP), peak, non-firm power delivered in the western half of the system for Thursday was valued near $18.75 a MWh, flat from Tuesday's level.</p>
<p>Off-peak, non-firm electricity in western NYPP for next-day delivery was pegged at $13.00-$14.00.</p>
<p>Next-day, peak, non-firm power in eastern NYPP was quoted at $22.00-$24.00 a MWh, while next-day electricity in eastern NYPP for light load hours was talked at $17.00-$18.00.</p>
