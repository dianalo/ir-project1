<title>USA: Exxon big gasoline buyer on cat cracker problems.</title>
<headline>Exxon big gasoline buyer on cat cracker problems.</headline>

<p>Exxon Corp was a large and visible buyer of gasoline on Wednesday as the bulk of its catalytic cracking capacity was temporarily taken out of action, traders said.</p>
<p>Gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange shot up as the rumours of a problem at one of the cat crackers at its Baytown, Texas plant surfaced on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The September contract traded as high as 66.40 cents and closed at 66.00 cents a gallon, largely driven by Exxon's aggressive buying and the talk of the unit's problems.</p>
<p>The company confirmed late Wednesday that the unit was taken out of service after an "operational problem," though it wouldn't comment how long it would be down.</p>
<p>Exxon said its 110,000 barrels per day (bpd) Number 3 cat-cracker was down. The plant, with 411,000 bpd crude distillation capacity, has a total of 190,000 bpd of cat-cracking capability.</p>
<p>"Everyone is trying to guess how long it will be down," said a petroleum products trader for a major oil company.</p>
<p>An Exxon source familiar with the plant's operations said earlier on Wednesday that the unit was still "limping along" as the problem was assessed. He said a short downtime of a day or so was expected, though it was impossible to determine until the problem in the unit was evaluated.</p>
<p>"Exxon had bought about half-a-million barrels (of M1 grade) gasoline by 10.30 this morning," said a trader of U.S. Gulf gasoline.</p>
<p>He said that was about five days cover for Exxon and the company bought some more later, indicating that the cat-cracker was expected to be down for a week or so, typical turnaround time for a routine cat-cracker problem.</p>
<p>The gain in the futures and the half-cent gain in the premium put Gulf gasoline about a total of three cents a gallon higher on the day, traders said.</p>
