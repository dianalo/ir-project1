<p>When suicide bombers killed 13 people in a crowded Jerusalem market last week, Mazen Abed knew it was time to brush up his card-playing skills.</p>
<p>Abed and other Palestinians who travel to work in Israel braced for Israel's predictable response -- sealing off Palestinian territories and cutting off tens of thousands of Palestinians from their work in Israel.</p>
<p>"We're getting used to it. We work about two months, then there's a (bombing) operation and we have to stay at home for a month," said Abed, as friends dealt cards in the Amari cafe outside the West Bank town of Ramallah.</p>
<p>Palestinians say the Israeli clamp-down is a collective punishment, turning their West Bank and Gaza Strip territories into a "big prison".</p>
<p>Officials say the blockade has cost $5 million to $9 million in losses a day, allegedly caused the death of an elderly Gazan woman and hit workers inside the West Bank as Israeli soldiers block roads between the patchwork of small Palestinian self-rule areas.</p>
<p>Doctors, labourers, engineers and traders all say they have to creep around winding side roads to get to work.</p>
<p>Abed, a father of four who travels to work at an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, said he was barred from working there after every eruption of Palestinian-Israeli violence.</p>
<p>Next to him in the cafe, already packed by mid-morning with unemployed men, 30-year-old Mohammed, a worker on a Tel Aviv construction site and father of three, said he did not expect work for another two months.</p>
<p>"They let the old men back in first. We have to wait to the end," he said, sipping his tea and checking his cards. "Every time there's a (bombing) operation it's the same. Netanyahu's starving 1.5 million people because of a single action.</p>
<p>"Peace? It's just something we see on television... We're living in a big prison," Mohammed said.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected Arab pleas to lift the closure, imposed in the wake of the Jerusalem market bombing.</p>
<p>The Israeli army said on Friday it was easing the internal closure around Nablus and Jericho but kept up roadblocks around other West Bank towns.</p>
<p>Nablus residents said roadblocks in the area had been eased but buses taking Palestinians to the Jordanian border were still being held up in Jericho.</p>
<p>"We're living in cantons now, in ghettos," said Youssef Abu Mohammad, an engineer at a concrete supplier outside Ramallah.</p>
<p>He said half of the workers at the company could not come into work and movement of equipment was being obstructed.</p>
<p>"This is even tougher than previous closures...Just to go from village to village you need a pass," he said.</p>
<p>Fruit sellers in Ramallah's central market said they had been taking twice as long to get their goods from Nablus.</p>
<p>"It's not just side roads we have to take. They've forced us into the mountains," said market trader Ramzi Abed.</p>
<p>The main West Bank hospital in Ramallah said some doctors had been prevented from getting to work.</p>
<p>"On Wednesday night we had a caesarean operation and no anaesthetist. The technician had to put the mother to sleep," hospital director Shawki Harb said. "On Thursday eight of our doctors could not reach the hospital, and people are scared of bringing in emergency cases at night."</p>
<p>Some roadblocks are just shows of force by the Israeli army.</p>
<p>At one junction outside Ramallah soldiers turned back all West Bank-registered cars and watched as they took a 30-second detour and rejoined their route just down the road.</p>
<p>But Salem Badareen, a construction site worker in Ramallah, said he was doubling up as night watchman because he couldn't get back to his home in Hebron at the end of the day.</p>
<p>"Last time I went home was before the bombing," he said.</p>
<p>His supervisor Motaz Ibrahim said problems with labour and supplies meant he faced a penalty for missing deadlines.</p>
<p>"My contract says finish the job in 40 days, closure or no closure...I don't know if I can do it. If you were an investor, would you invest here?"</p>
