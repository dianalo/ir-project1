<p>Malaysia's Kemayan Corp Bhd has proposed a one-for-three bonus issue and announced details on a number of property projects.</p>
<p>The property and plantations concern said in a statement it was also proposing a rights issue of up to 260.9 million ringgit eight percent irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stock (ICULS) on the basis of one ICULS for every 10 shares.</p>
<p>New shares amounting to 124.25 million will be issued from the bonus issue.</p>
<p>Kemayan said it was in the final stages of securing a privatisation project in the United Kingdom, without giving details. Negotiations are expected to be completed in October.</p>
<p>The company also plans to develop a mixed-use complex in southern Johor Baru with the first phase costing 870 million ringgit. Another project is a 900 million ringgit township on Bintan island, Indonesia with an Indonesian partner.</p>
<p>Kemayan also proposed to acquire the entire issued and paid-up capital of property development company, VM Development Sdn Bhd, for about 60 million ringgit.  </p>
<p>VM Development owns 214 acres of land in central Negeri Sembilan state which is planned to be developed into a 990 million ringgit marina resort development including a 250-room hotel.</p>
<p>Kemayan said the ICULS rights issue will raise gross proceeds of 260.92 million ringgit which would be used to invest in the U.K. project, and to part finance the Johor and Bintan projects.</p>
