<p>British military authorities in Cyprus on Monday released the names of three soldiers killed in a traffic accident on Sunday.</p>
<p>They are staff sergeant Nathaniel McMahon, 36, from Northern Ireland, Lance Corporal Alan Vow, 31, from Wrexham, north Wales, and soldier Darren Horton, 21, from Lancashire, a member of the Kings Regiment.</p>
<p>A fourth soldier seriously injured in the crash is undergoing treatment at the General Hospital in the capital Nicosia. He has not been identified.</p>
<p>"Relatives have been flown out to be with him. He is in stable condition," a British army spokesman said.</p>
<p>The accident happened early on Sunday afternoon on a busy road between the British base of Dhekelia and the resort town of Ayia Napa in south eastern Cyprus. The soldiers were based in Dhekelia.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the soldiers' car collided with a truck coming in the opposite direction and ended up in a field, trapping the soldiers in the wreckage. All three soldiers were dead on arrival at hospital.</p>
<p>Around 3,700 British military personnel are serving at two bases in Cyprus.</p>
