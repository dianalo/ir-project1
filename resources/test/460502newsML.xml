<p>Dutch exports will certainly reach the previously forecast total of 350 billion guilders in 1997, the Dutch association of exporting companies NEC said on Friday.</p>
<p>In 1996, Dutch exports grew by nine percent to 313.5 billion guilders.</p>
<p>Even to European Union countries such as Germany which currently face difficult economic conditions, exports were still expected to grow this year, the NEC said. It added that persistent cost containment by Dutch companies over the past few years had substantially improved their competitive position.</p>
