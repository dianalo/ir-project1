<p>Israeli police on Monday questioned Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert in connection with an alleged government corruption case, a police spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said investigators took testimony from Olmert for one hour in his office. She declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>Itim news agency quoted Olmert as saying after the meeting his name was mentioned in the case "by accident" and he doubted he could contribute to the investigation.</p>
<p>Police are investigating allegations by Israel Television that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government appointed an attorney-general last month as part of a deal with a politician on trial for corruption.</p>
<p>The attorney-general, Roni Bar-On, quit 12 hours after taking office. The television said religious Shas party leader Aryeh Deri demanded Bar-On get the job in exchange for Shas's support for Netanyahu's accord with the PLO on Hebron.</p>
<p>It said Bar-On promised Deri a plea-bargain that would have let Deri continue his political career. The cabinet later approved the Hebron deal with Shas's support.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, Deri and Bar-On have all denied the charges.</p>
