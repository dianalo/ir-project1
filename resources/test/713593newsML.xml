<p>NATO allies Greece and Turkey agreed a set of principles on Tuesday designed to improve their testy relations, including a commitment to settle disputes by peaceful means, the U.S. State Department announced.</p>
<p>A statement issued after a meeting between the Greek and Turkish foreign ministers and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright focused on the two countries' dispute over the Aegean Sea that has burdened relations over the last year and a half.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean neighbours almost came to blows in early 1996 over a small Aegean island known to Greeks as Imia and to Turks as Kardak, frustrating previous efforts to defuse long- standing tensions.</p>
<p>A "convergence of views" reached by Greece's Theodoros Pangalos and Turkey's Ismail Cem during a NATO summit in Madrid included a "commitment to settle disputes by peaceful means based on mutual consent and without use of force or threat of force".</p>
<p>The statement by State Department deputy spokesman James Foley also said the two countries pledged "respect for each other's legitimate, vital interests and concerns in the Aegean".</p>
<p>U.S. officials said the six principles were later endorsed at a meeting in Madrid between Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.</p>
<p>They included a commitment to refrain from "unilateral acts" so as to avoid conflicts arising from misunderstanding; respect for each other sovereignty and for international law and agreements; and commitment to peace, security and good neighbourly relations.</p>
<p>The statement made no attempt to tackle the Imia/Kardak dispute or other Aegean problems between Greece and Turkey which include overflight and seabed exploitation rights.</p>
<p>As de facto leader of NATO, the United States closely follows Greek-Turkish relations, but officials said the U.S. role in Tuesday's statement was that of a "facilitator" rather than a mediator.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition he was not identified, said the statement was "quite important to both sides because it sets a foundation for the kind of practical things which they wish to do now".</p>
<p>But adding a note of caution, he said: "We will consider this to be fully successful when they move forward with some of these practical solutions."</p>
<p>Private analysts also took a wait-and-see attitude. "If fully implemented, this agreement will constitute a remarkable step forward for security and stability in the southeastern NATO area," said Tassos Kokkinides of the British-American Security Information Council.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said that although the Cyprus dispute was mentioned at Tuesday's 40-minute meeting, the Aegean statement was not directly related to talks opening in New York state on Wednesday between Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders.</p>
<p>Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when mainland Turkish troops invaded part of the island in response to a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia backed by the military junta then ruling Greece.</p>
