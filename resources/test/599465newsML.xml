<p>Two heavyweights in the New Zealand electricity industry ended a bitter takeover battle for Power New Zealand on Tuesday to instead form joint control.</p>
<p>Auckland power distributor Mercury Energy and the Kansas-based UtiliCorp United Inc have been slugging it out for 2-1/2 years for control of listed Power New Zealand, Mercury's rival for power distribution in Auckland.</p>
<p>The two buried their differences saying they had formed a joint venture to control PNZ and simultaneously announced a NZ$6 a share offer to minorities.  </p>
<p>Together, Mercury and Utilicorp own 64 percent of PNZ.</p>
<p>Their battle saw each bid the other up from a starting price in 1994 of NZ$3.40 per share to NZ$10 per share offered to a group of local authority holders controlling 7.1 percent of PNZ.</p>
<p>A bid at NZ$6 per share values PNZ at over NZ$900 million.</p>
<p>"The proposal was a practical, commercial solution to the impasse which had developed over ownership and merger. It ends the long-running share battle and paves the way for a new era," the companies said in a joint statement.  </p>
<p>Mercury chief executive Wayne Gilbert said in an interview with Reuters that the settlement of the PNZ issue cleared the way for Mercury to list on the New Zealand exchange.</p>
<p>Listing had been delayed because of problems caused by the protracted takeover bid.</p>
<p>"The float now is certain and it will be sooner rather than later," he said.</p>
<p>Gilbert said the preparation of a prospectus would mean the float would come next year rather than this year. The company's board is meeting this week to consider the issue, he added.  </p>
<p>"Reaching an accommodation with each other was a better proposition than continuing to stage a battle in which neither of us could prevail," Gilbert said of the today's deal.</p>
<p>The joint venture would need permission from the anti-trust Commerce Commission for the proposal to proceed.</p>
<p>The companies jointly will have nearly 45 percent of the total retail electricity market.</p>
<p>But clearance appears probable. The commission in 1994 gave Mercury permission to proceed with its takeover offer arguing there were enough other distributors to offer competition.  </p>
<p>Gilbert noted that Power and Mercury would remain separate entities and a merger in future was not part of the deal.</p>
<p>He said planned financial benefits would be very substantial but less that the annual NZ$30 million estimated from a merger.</p>
<p>As well as the Auckland market, the joint venture will gain control of WEL Energy, the distributing company in the neighbouring Waikato district.</p>
<p>Utilicorp had 39.5 percent of WEL and said it would sell that holding into the joint venture with Mercury. PNZ also has 10 percent of WEL.  </p>
<p>Utilicorp launched the venture through Utilicorp New Zealand, controlled 79 percent by itself and 21 percent by the private Todd Corporation.</p>
<p>Utilicorp Senior Vice-President, Australasia, Paul Perkins said the decision to enter the joint venture underlined its commitment to New Zealand.</p>
<p>"New Zealand is an excellent market with great opportunities," he said.  </p>
<p>He declined to say whether Utilicorp would become involved in other ventures with Mercury such as a 114 megawatt power station Mercury is jointly building in South Auckland with Canada's TransAlta.</p>
<p>"We have enough on our plate now," Perkins said.</p>
<p>The board of PNZ will meet with its major shareholders on Thursday, afterwhich it expects to issue statement.</p>
