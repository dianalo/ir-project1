<p>It was becoming increasingly urgent that decisions be taken on the future of the South African oil industry, the Africa Oil 1996 conference heard on Tuesday.</p>
<p>South African Petroleum Industry Association (Sapia) director Colin McClelland said that important investment decisions hung on the need for greater certainty about the future.</p>
<p>"It is becoming urgent that there be clarity on the 'rules of the game' for the future as important decisions are required on refining investments to meet growing demand," McClelland said.</p>
<p>"Policy issues are at stake as well. Should the needed capacity be provided by synfuels, by imports or by expansions of the conventional refineries?"</p>
<p>Sapia favoured the latter option provided there was a climate that encouraged investment in South Africa.</p>
<p>"You will appreciate the importance to the nation of making the correct policy choices. These could include additional synthetic fuel production so long as the investments are economic and do not rely on subsidies to pay their way."</p>
<p>He had earlier said that the demand for gasoline was about to outstrip national refining capacity.</p>
<p>One of the greatest uncertainties faced by oil companies in recent years had been the failure of government to adjust marketing margins in line with laid down agreements.</p>
<p>McClelland said that an increase in the margin had become due on January 1 this year but had not yet been approved.</p>
<p>"We hope for approval of this increase, the first since 1993, in the November price adjustment which is due on Wednesday, November 6," he said.</p>
<p>Despite the squeeze on margins, oil companies had continued to invest about 1.5 billion rand a year in marketing and refining to meet demand.</p>
<p>"It is now crucial that the regulatory rules be consistently applied by government," he said.</p>
