<p>British farmers have virtually completed sowings of the 1997/98 sugar beet crop and are still ahead of the equivalent stage a year ago, a British Sugar official said on Monday.</p>
<p>Ground drillings were now 98 percent complete, compared with 93 percent last year, he said.</p>
<p>Farmers took advantage of mild spring weather to drill their beets early, ensuring that overall sowings outpaced last year.</p>
<p>"We are having a good spring this year -- they saw the drilling window and went for it," the official said. British Sugar's recommended drilling period is from March 10 to April 10.</p>
<p>"It is virtually all in but now they need some rain. It's not too dry...there's been very little redrilling but the ground needs some gentle rain to get it going," he added.</p>
<p>Britain is expected to have a total beet area of 170,000 hectares, the same as in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Britain produced a record 1.48 million tonnes of sugar in white value terms from its 1996/97 beet crop. The previous record was in 1992/93, when around 1,000 tonnes less sugar was produced.</p>
