<p>U.S. experts are watching Russian President Boris Yeltsin's cabinet shakeup with hope and perhaps a measure of dread, saying it will be critical for the success of economic reforms.</p>
<p>The upcoming overhaul, which Yeltsin began a week ago, opens the possibility of a completely reformist government for the first time since 1991.</p>
<p>But the shakeup also threatens instability that could hasten the decline in the Russian economy, the experts said.</p>
<p>"This is first time since 1991 Yeltsin wants a completely reformist government," said Joseph Blasi, professor of Russian economics at Rutgers University. "Reformists and non-reformers divided his previous coalitions," said Blasi, who is the author of a 1996 book on Russian privatization called Kremlin Capitalism.</p>
<p>A Russian government spokesman said the revamped cabinet would likely be announced before Yeltsin heads for Helskinki on Wednesday for a summit with U.S. president Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>The key figure of the new cabinet is Anatoly Chubais, who Yeltsin has already named as his first deputy prime minister.</p>
<p>The Russian financial markets cheered at the prospect that Chubais would bring in young radical reformers to give fresh momentum to market reform.</p>
<p>But U.S. experts were more circumspect, saying the tasks of the next stage of reform will be more difficult to implement than the trail-brazing earlier stages.</p>
<p>Pressing challenges include the staggering wage arrears for public sector employees and the army, as well as chaotic tax codes and unenforceable laws.</p>
<p>"Without the second stage of reform, Russia was about to get worse," said Blasi, who said social unrest is growing alarmingly.</p>
<p>Blasi said Chubais offers the best hope for taking decisive steps to stave off the crisis. But he warned that, given the complexity of the tasks, the West should have modest expectations.</p>
<p>Vladimir Kvint, director of emerging markets at Arthur Andersen, had a gloomier view of Chubais, saying he and his followers will be unable to restore public confidence in the government.</p>
<p>The privatization advocated by Chubais was widely perceived as a scheme for robbing the state and enriching a few, and his lack of support in the parliament would curtail his rise, Kvint said.</p>
<p>"Chubais has no political future," he said.</p>
<p>Kvint also noted that, with the ascendancy of Chubais, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would face either becoming a figurehead or resigning from office.</p>
<p>Often portrayed as an unimaginative technocrat from the Soviet era, Chernomyrdin helped stabilize the economy after the rouble's collpase in 1992 and has kept reform on course.</p>
<p>Without Chernomyrdin as a ballast, the economic crisis in Russia could get out of control faster, Kvint predicted.</p>
<p>Daniel Claude, manager of the Firebird Fund, which invests in Russia, said that, in Chubais, Yeltsin has chosen the right man to spearhead the reform.</p>
<p>"Yeltsin needs someone unpopular to do the dirty job," Claude said.</p>
