<p>Raba Rt, a Hungarian supplier of major parts for commercial vehicles, boosted Budapest's air cargo exports in second-quarter 1997, shipping roughly 160 tonnes of axles and axle parts to the United States, transport industry officials told Reuters.</p>
<p>Raba, whose full name is Raba Magyar Vagon -es Gepgyar, delivered the components to Dana Corp and Rockwell International Corp, two big customers for Raba's growing U.S. exports, which topped $100 million in 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>"Raba only expected a moderate increase in sales this year, but the business has been booming because the U.S. economy has been racing like a runaway locomotive," a cargo executive said.</p>
<p>"Raba generated the biggest new business in the cargo market for the spring season, but its shipments all have been ad hoc, so it's hard to say whether they will continue," the official added.</p>
<p>Raba, Hungary's top U.S. exporter, shipped roughly 90 tonnes of the 160 tonnes via Deutsche Lufthansa AG , often trucked to Munich and flown to New York.</p>
<p>Rockwell took the remaining 70 tonnes, mainly from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which flew the parts to Detroit from Amsterdam. KLM first trucked the parts to Vienna, where they were flown or trucked to Amsterdam.</p>
<p>"The axles can't fit into aircraft that normally operate from Budapest, so they have to be trucked to hubs where bigger planes fly," an airline official said.</p>
<p>Raba, which typically uses sea and suface transport, also started sales this year to Asia, supplying Japan's Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Korea's Daewoo Group, Hyundai Motor Co Ltd and Ssangyong Group.</p>
<p>The Far East business already has yielded one shipment to Nissan on Swissair, the official said.</p>
