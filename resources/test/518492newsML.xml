<p>The U.S. Senate will move nearer on Thursday to a debate on an international treaty outlawing chemical weapons as it first considers a separate, go-it-alone rival bill being pushed by conservative opponents of the pact.</p>
<p>The bill, introduced by Arizona Republican Jon Kyl, would outlaw chemical and biological weapons within the United States and require U.S. sanctions against any country using these agents against another country or its own nationals.</p>
<p>But President Bill Clinton is pushing for Senate approval of the Chemical Weapons Convention before April 29, when it enters into force, with or without the United States.</p>
<p>The treaty, signed by 161 nations and ratified by 70, bans the development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons. Its approval requires a two-third majority of the Senate.</p>
<p>The debate on the Kyl bill, due to start on Thursday afternoon, is expected to set the Senate on track for debate next week on the treaty, with a vote tentatively set for April 24.</p>
<p>But first proponents of the treaty must win over its leading Senate foe, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican.</p>
<p>Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott has been in intensive negotiations with Helms to clear the way for the needed unanimous consent of the Senate to proceed with the treaty. Announcement of an agreement could come on Thursday, even as Helms' committee hears more testimony from treaty opponents.</p>
<p>Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the committee, calls the Kyl bill a "wild card" in its effect on the treaty. It is unclear whether senators would see its approval as an excuse to vote against the treaty.</p>
<p>As Helms came up with objection after objection to the treaty, Biden sought to negotiate agreement on their differences. Biden said on Tuesday agreement had been reached on 23 of 33 conditions that Helms was proposing.</p>
<p>But he said that "killer" amendments proposed by Helms would probably have to be voted on by the Senate. These would:</p>
<p>- Bar the United States from participation in the treaty until so-called "rogue" states, such as Iraq and Libya, were included.</p>
<p>- Raise the standards of verification against cheating to unachievable levels.</p>
<p>- Link U.S. participation to Russian ratification of the pact and compliance with an earlier agreement to destroy its poison gas stocks.</p>
<p>- Require renegotiation of treaty articles requiring exchange of information on chemical weapons defences and on chemical trade.</p>
