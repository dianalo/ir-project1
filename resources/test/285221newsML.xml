<p>The Polish bourse should fall next week after this week's 2.3-percent rise, analysts said, as investors may have come to believe that expected institutional buying in January had largely happened in December.</p>
<p>Analysts said the main WIG index, which has risen nine percent since December 10 to 14,484.8 points at Friday's close, was pushed up in anticipation of buying by investment funds unwilling to take risks at the end of 1996's financial year.</p>
<p>"It seems that those who thought there might be a 'January effect' bought in December...and now there could be falls," said Pawel Tarnowski of Raiffeisen Capital &amp; Investment.</p>
<p>Analysts said there were ever fewer stocks not fully valued after recent rises, which came on the back of the bourse's 80-percent surge last year, and that 14,500 points provided strong resistance.</p>
<p>They said Friday's 25-percent higher turnover might normally be a good sign but that the strong selling after price fixing suggested the market was not strong enough to string together sessions of growth and higher trade.</p>
<p>"The bourse hasn't achieved turnovers of 100 million zlotys per session so now I don't think we can count on more growth," said Michal Szczurek, an analyst at ING BSK Asset Management.</p>
<p>But Szczurek expected a slight downward drift rather than drastic falls, in part because large cap stocks such as Elektrim, the bourse's most heavily weighted issue, had recently seen slight growth.</p>
<p>Analysts said another reason for pessimism was the threat by the central bank over recent months to increase interest rates as soon as mid-January to curb fast credit growth.</p>
<p>They said energy price rises at the start of January could put this month's inflation at around two percent and further dampen the market mood.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors would be watching the food-price figure for the last 10 days in December due on Wednesday, which Raiffeisen's Tarnowski said could put December inflation at about 1.5 percent and year-on-year inflation around 19 percent.</p>
<p>The latter figure has been expected by many analysts for some months despite the government's ambitious 17-percent target at the start of 1996.</p>
<p>Analysts said this week's main market top gainer, Espebepe, enjoyed a 30.4-percent speculative gain after having fallen for most of 1996 on a bankruptcy threat.</p>
<p>They said Novita, up 16.2 percent, surged after it gained 3.2 million zlotys from selling 10 percent of a subsidiary to Armstrong Enterprises.</p>
<p>The week's biggest loser, Polifarb Wroclaw down eight percent, fell in profit-taking after its recent surge on news it sought to merge with Polifarb Cieszyn.</p>
