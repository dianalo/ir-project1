<text>
<p>MATIF February wheat, the third month of the futures contract, expired without delivery, the French exchange said on Thursday.</p>
<p>February open interest after Wednesday's last trading day was zero, a MATIF spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>A final 22 lots of February wheat changed hands on Wednesday, she said.</p>
<p>MATIF launched the contract on July 5 with an inaugural volume of 153 lots but slack physical markets have limited trade.</p>
<p>MATIF has said the contract needed time to develop as legal problems delayed its launch by several months.</p>
<p>It has avoided giving a volume target for the contract but sources close to the exchange have said 1,000 lots daily would have been considered a success.</p>
<p>Since the launch, open interest peaked on December 20 at 1,092 lots while daily volume hit a record high of 320 lots on September 26.</p>
<p>December volume reached 774 lots, with an average 37 lots traded daily, the latest MATIF statistics show.</p>
