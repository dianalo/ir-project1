<p>A military appeals court ruled Monday the Army could not bar the media from a hearing to determine if there was enough evidence to court-martial its top enlisted man on sexual misconduct charges.</p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces ruled in favour of television networks and military justice groups, who had pressed to open the preliminary hearing in the case of Sergeant Major of the Army Gene McKinney to media coverage.</p>
<p>McKinney's hearing before a military officer had been due to begin in Washington on Monday but was postponed temporarily because of the appeal of an Army decision to close it.</p>
<p>The hearing officer will decide if McKinney will face court martial on any of 18 charges of sexual misconduct, adultery and obstruction of justice involving three Army women and a woman sailor over a three-year period.</p>
<p>McKinney, who is 46 and married, has denied the charges. He is the only soldier who carries the military title Sergeant Major of the Army, the service's highest enlisted rank.</p>
<p>Lawyers for McKinney and Brenda Houser, a retired sergeant major who is one of four female accusers of McKinney, also asked that the preliminary hearing be opened to coverage.</p>
<p>McKinney is accused of adultery with one of the four women and propositioning three others. He is also charged with assault, indecent assault, making a threat, mistreatment of a subordinate and obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>The hearing officer will weigh the evidence and decide whether to proceed with a trial, change the charges against McKinney, or dismiss the case.</p>
<p>The case is the latest in a scandal involving adultery and sexual harassment in the military. One of the Defence Department's leading candidates to take over as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff recently withdrew his name from consideration after a firestorm erupted over an adulterous affair 13 years ago.</p>
