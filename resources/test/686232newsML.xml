<p>The World Bank, responding to pressure from the United States, said on Wednesday it had delayed debate on a $30 million loan to Croatia until July 1.</p>
<p>The loan was originally due to have been discussed this week, but the debate was put back after Washington said it was worried about issues including Croatia's record in bringing war criminals to justice and on the return of Serb refugees.</p>
<p>Croatian Prime Minister Zlatko Matesa told Reuters in Dubrovnik he thought World Bank policy was wrong.</p>
<p>"We are talking about a loan. It is something which by definition has to be paid back. It is not a gift and I do not think the World Bank is an institution which (should) be used for political means," he said.</p>
<p>U.S. State Department spokesman John Dinger said on Tuesday that Washington was worried about several issues.</p>
<p>"We believe that Croatia's lack of cooperation on Dayton undermines prospects for regional stability and also calls into question Croatia's commitment to implement and sustain economic programmes that are necessary for prosperity," he said.</p>
<p>The Dayton peace accords, signed in November 1995, ended 4-1/2 years of fighting in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
