<p>Warner Bros. said on Tuesday it was committed to a cinema-building programme with partners across Europe and unveiled plans to introduce giant "megaplexes" to cater for growing audiences.</p>
<p>Warner Bros., part of U.S. entertainment giant Time Warner Inc, has a joint venture with Australia's Village Roadshow Ltd to operate cinemas in Britain and Germany.</p>
<p>The Warner Village venture on Tuesday opened its 17th multiplex in Britain at Dagenham, just east of London, and has plans to increase that to around 40 sites</p>
<p>"We have a further 20-24 locations that we've identified and are negotiating on to establish a premier multiplex cinema company under the Warner Village brand," Millard L.Ochs, president of Warner Bros. International Theatres, said.</p>
<p>"It's a very positive, very aggressive business plan but we're seeing super results," Ochs said in an interview, adding that Warner Bros. was achieving returns on investment of 25 percent and that sites were paying for themselves in four years.</p>
<p>He said there were now just over 100 multiplexes in Britain and he believed that there was room for around 50 or so more.</p>
<p>The advent of the multiscreen cinema complex has helped to spark a dramatic revival in attendance over the past decade.</p>
<p>Annual attendance has more than doubled from just over 50 million in the mid-1980s to a level of around 125 million.</p>
<p>Ochs said Warner Village was on the verge of securing British sites for "megaplexes" -- venues with in excess of 15 screens and said that some of the company's complexes in other European markets would be of similar size.</p>
<p>Warner Bros has cinemas in Spain and Portugal with local partners while the Warner Village venture has ambitious plans to expand on its four sites in Germany.</p>
<p>"In Spain, Portugal and Germany growth has been a little slower than the UK but attendance levels are going in the right direction," he said.</p>
<p>Warner Village is working on a 20-site plan for Germany, aiming to attract filmgoers to out-of-town sites rather than the more traditional city centre theatres. Ochs said that a multiplex cost around a million dollars per screen to build.</p>
<p>Italy is another key market for Warner Village, the venture planning to open new cinemas in the cities of Verona, Vicenza, Perugia and Bari within the next 18 months.</p>
<p>Further afield, Warner Bros has a partnership with retail group Mycal in Japan which operates some 50 screens. Ochs said the plan was to double that number within the next 12 months and increase it to in excess of 200 by the turn of the century.</p>
