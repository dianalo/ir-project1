<p>Greek equities fall firmly in the sell territory of European emerging markets when weighing forecast P/E levels versus estimated earnings per share (EPS) growth, Merrill Lynch said in a market report.</p>
<p>"We stress that the government will be challenged to sustain the CPI trend without an uptick by year-end. Even if sustained, we see limited potential for further upside when considering the low EPS growth prospects for Greek companies," the report said.</p>
<p>Greek shares have come out of the cold and managed impressive gains of 31.2 percent on the benchmark general share index based on Wednesday's close at 1,252.37.  </p>
<p>For the market to sustain and expand upon current valuations, falling inflation and a strong drachma are a prerequisite, Merrill Lynch analyst Mike Harris told Reuters.</p>
<p>January inflation dropped to 6.8 percent year-on-year from 7.3 percent in December 1996, based on the recently revised CPI index.</p>
<p>Although the sense of euphoria could lead to further market gains Merrill Lynch was cautious.</p>
<p>"However, we don't believe the risk-reward profile to be compelling. The market could give up about one third of its gains," Harris said.</p>
<p>The Athens bourse had trimmed mid-session losses of over 2.0 percent on Thursday but was still trading in negative territory, down 1.38 percent.</p>
<p>The market viewpoint was a sobering assessment of Wednesday's bullish outlook by ING Barings which forecast that the bull run of the Greek bourse was sustainable and not speculative in nature. --George Georgiopoulos, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
