<title>USA: U.S. High Court to decide reach of appeals law.</title>
<headline>U.S. High Court to decide reach of appeals law.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide whether a federal law that sharply restricts appeals by prison inmates should apply to all pending cases when President Bill Clinton signed it in April.</p>
<p>The justices will determine the reach of the law -- whether it applies only to cases brought after it took effect or to all cases pending at the time.</p>
<p>The law limits federal habeas appeals by inmates challenging their convictions or sentences on the grounds their constitutional rights had been violated. The High Court in June upheld a key section of the law as constitutional.</p>
<p>The section of the law now at issue bars relief in federal court unless the inmate shows the state court decision had been contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The justices will hear arguments in the case of Aaron Lindh in April, with a decision is expected by June.</p>
<p>Lindh was found guilty of two murders in a 1988 shooting in Madison, Wisconsin. He was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences, plus 35 years.</p>
<p>Lindh challenged his conviction. He claimed his constitutional rights had been violated because his lawyer at trial had been barred from asking about allegations that a key prosecution witness, a psychiatrist, had sexual relations with his patients.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld his conviction, and Lindh then brought a federal habeas appeal.</p>
<p>He appealed to the Supreme Court after a U.S. appeals court ruled the restrictions in the 1996 federal law do apply retroactively to all pending cases.</p>
<p>In a separate development, the justices also agreed to consider an appeal by a death-row inmate who was convicted of murder, but is appealing because the judge later was found guilting of taking bribes in other criminal cases.</p>
<p>William Bracy was convicted for a triple murder in Chicago in 1980. The judge who presided over the trial and sentencing later was found guilty as part of a federal investigation into judicial corruption.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court will consider whether Bracy was entitled to gather evidence to support his claim that he was denied the right to a trial before an impartial judge.</p>
<p>Bracy claimed the judge's taking bribes may have influenced his decisions in other cases. A U.S. appeals court rejected the argument.</p>
