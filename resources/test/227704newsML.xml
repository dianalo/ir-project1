<p>Freedom Securities said it has completed its buyout from parent company John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co for $180 million, Chief Executive John Goldsmith said.</p>
<p>"We completed our deal," Goldsmith told Reuters in a telephone interview. "We're going to continue to run the business as we've run it."</p>
<p>John Hancock will continue to hold a five percent stake in the company, Goldsmith said.</p>
<p>Freedom Securities is composed of two regional brokerages, Boston-based Tucker Anthony Inc and Sutro and Co Inc, based in San Francisco, and Freedom Capital Inc, the money management arm of the two companies.</p>
<p>Boston buyout specialist Thomas Lee and Philadelphia-based SCP Partners provided about $50 million in financing towards the deal and about 350 employees invested $25 million, Goldsmith said. The rest of the financing was provided by banks led by BankBoston Corp, he added.</p>
