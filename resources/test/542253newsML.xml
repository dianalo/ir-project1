<p>A self-proclaimed white supremacist opened fire with a rifle on a Dallas synagogue with hundreds of people inside this weekend, but noone was injured, officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Donald Anderson, 48, was arrested moments after the synagogue shooting in north Dallas on Saturday, police spokesman Ed Spencer said. He was charged with deadly conduct and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Anderson screamed, "Die, Jews, die" when he opened fire outside the synagogue. Anderson told police he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
<p>But police said he appeared to know very little about the white supremacist group, and he fired into the air and at the synagogue sign rather than directly at people going into the building.</p>
<p>"The opportunity was certainly there, so the fact that he didn't do it indicated he didn't mean to shoot anyone," Spencer said. "Having said that, it is still enormously dangerous to engage in that kind of activity."</p>
<p>At least 250 people were inside the synagogue at the time of the incident.</p>
