<text>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has reprimanded Kerry Securities Ltd for trading in commodity futures contracts without being registered as a dealer and failing to maintain suitable controls and procedures.</p>
<p>The reprimand stems from an investigation covering the period November 1993 to July 1996, Hong Kong's securities watchdog said on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Kerry Securities said in a statement that its current directors and management had extended full co-operation and assistance to the SFC after becoming aware of the events in July 1996, and appreciated that no further action on this matter will be taken by the SFC against the company and its staff.</p>
<p>Managing director Allan Read said Kerry Securities had taken action both before and after July 1996 to improve controls, systems and compliance, and that all existing staff had been counselled on the need for professional business conduct.</p>
