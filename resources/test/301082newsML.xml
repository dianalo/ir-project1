<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin, fighting pneumonia in hospital, was more active on Saturday and his condition had become more stable, the Kremlin said.</p>
<p>A Kremlin statement, issued after doctors made morning checks on the 65-year-old president at Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital, also said that Yeltsin's temperature was normal and that his blood pressure was stable.  </p>
<p>"In their (the doctors') opinion, the patient's condition has stabilised, his activity has grown somewhat," said the statement. It added that the next official press release on Yeltsin's health would be issued on Sunday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin was taken to hospital on Wednesday evening, only two weeks after he returned to work following a quintuple heart bypass operation on November 5.</p>
<p>Top Kremlin doctor Sergei Mironov told a news conference on Friday that Yeltsin was depressed over the new bout of illness but would have to stay away from his Kremlin office for at least another three weeks.</p>
<p>The West and Russian markets have so far shrugged off his new illness, but some Russian media and political figures have raised doubts over his ability to rule.</p>
