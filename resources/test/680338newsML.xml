<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on Monday he would like the United States to cooperate in stablizing foreign exchange rates because currency volatilty might cause the Japanese government to sell its holding of U.S. government securities.</p>
<p>Hashimoto made his comments in Japanese. News reports based on English-language translations of his comments caused turmoil in U.S. markets during late trading Monday.  </p>
<p>In a question-and-answer session following a speech at Columbia University, Hashimoto responded in general terms to a question about whether or not it would be worth it for Japan to hold U.S. Treasury securities if the dollar fell sharply.</p>
<p>He did not say whether Japan would actually sell U.S. Treasury securities if the dollar moved wildly.</p>
<p>"In the past, we were tempted to sell U.S. Treasuries and buy gold  when I was involved in car negotiations with Mickey Kantor and when the U.S. was not interested in the dollar, a world key currency, when it was fluctuating wildly," he said.  </p>
<p>Hashimoto noted that in the past, Japan and other countries have kept holding U.S. government bonds even if the dollar had fallen.</p>
<p>"So please cooperate with us to stablize exchange rates in order to prevent us from being tempted to sell U.S. Treasuries and buy gold," he said.</p>
<p>Following reports of his comments, the Dow industrials finished off 192 points, or 2.5 percent; the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slid about 1/4 of a point after the Hashimoto comment, its yield rising sharply to close at 6.68 percent versus Friday's closing yield of 6.66 percent.  </p>
<p>COMEX August gold ended up $1.70 at $341.00 an ounce. Traders listed Hashimoto's comments as one of several factors bolstering gold.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin agreed last week in Denver that Tokyo and Washington will keep closely cooperating against wild currency fluctuations.</p>
<p>Hashimoto said Japanese holding of U.S. Treasuries are helping the U.S. economy. "I think the U.S. economy can withstand sales of U.S. treasuries by the Japanese government, if any, but such sales might have a big impact on the U.S. economy," he said.</p>
