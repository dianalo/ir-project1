<p>Gambia's national army held a ceremonial farewell on Friday for military leader Yahya Jammeh, who resigned to run in presidential elections on September 26.</p>
<p>Jammeh, who on Thursday predicted he would win 99 percent of the vote, said that after more than two years of army rule, running for president as a civilian was the only lawful way to continue the implementation of his development programme.</p>
<p>"We will be with you in spirit when the time comes to defend the nation's unity," he told officers and men of the small West African country's 800-strong army.</p>
<p>Jammeh, a U.S.-trained army captain who seized power in a July 1994 coup, resigned on August 28 along with associates in his provisional ruling council.</p>
<p>Military sources said he had been promoted to the rank of colonel at the time of his resignation and would remain the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.</p>
<p>Jammeh's most serious electoral rival, lawyer Ousainou Darboe of the United Democratic Party, has demanded a transitional government to organise the elections.</p>
