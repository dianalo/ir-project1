<p>Italy signed two agreements with Slovenia on Tuesday and said it would back its neighbour's claim for membership of an extended NATO and European Union.</p>
<p>"Italy will give full support to Slovenia's intentions," Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini told a news conference after talks with Slovenian counterpart Davorin Kracun.</p>
<p>"Slovenia has rebuilt its armed forces from scratch and has democratic controls over the armed forces," Kracun said.</p>
<p>Kracun said Slovenia had signed two agreements with Italy on visa issues. The first enabled citizens of both countries to come and go without the need for visas or passports and the second cleared up outstanding visa irregularities.</p>
<p>The Slovenian minister said membership of the EU and NATO would offer Italy "a secure eastern frontier and opportunities for much closer economic cooperation than previously".</p>
<p>The EU and Slovenia agreed an association agreement, an essential prelude to eventual membership, last June when Italy withdrew its objections after patching up a long-running row with the former Yugoslav republic over property laws.</p>
<p>Ljubljana had angered Rome by refusing to hand back state-owned property confiscated from ethnic Italians who fled from the Istria region after Italy's defeat in World War Two.</p>
<p>Italy had also disapproved of a Slovenian ban on foreigners owning real estate.</p>
<p>Italy dropped its objections after Slovenia agreed in May to bring in legislation to allow foreigners to own real estate within four years of the association agreement taking effect.</p>
