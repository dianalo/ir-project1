<p>Rescue workers pulled out two survivors from the ruins of a collapsed Cairo apartment block on Tuesday as the death toll rose to 16 with more than 90 people feared buried, police and doctors said.</p>
<p>Authorities have said the 11-storey building, which caved in on its residents on Sunday in the suburb of Heliopolis, had been illegally heightened.</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry has said prosecutors were questioning the owner of the building, Raouf Wissa Ibrahim, for illegally adding five storeys after getting permission to build one.</p>
<p>The building's porter also said he thought renovation work in one of the 40 apartments might have affected the structure, which has only one corner standing.</p>
<p>Soaring Cairo real estate prices have often pushed landlords to add extra floors to their properties illegally.</p>
<p>Several buildings have collapsed beneath the extra weight and recent earthquakes have also taken their toll on poorly constructed buildings in the crowded capital.</p>
