<p>Singapore's key share index closed higher on Tuesday as blue chips ended firmer at the last minute, although dealers said they saw no reason for the rise.</p>
<p>They said the market was directionless, with an early run-up in Malaysian over-the-counter shares overtaken by a last minute rise in blue chips.</p>
<p>"There were few buyers, but they definitely had guts," said an institutional dealer of the surge in blue chips.</p>
<p>The key Straits Times Industrials Index was 13.23 points up at 2,111.68, in line with Wall Street's two consecutive gains.</p>
<p>Market volume was a moderate 90.81 million shares with advances ahead of declines by 175 to 128.</p>
<p>Malaysia's Samanda Holdings topped the gainers on various rumours. "But it could be a rotational play since the stocks were tightly controlled and easy to manipulate for syndicate players," said a dealer with a local brokerage.</p>
<p>It surged Singapore $1.05 to S$9.20 on 95,000 shares traded.</p>
<p>Singapore Press foreign rose S$0.50 to $23.90 and Cycle &amp; Carriage was up S$0.30 to S$13.50.</p>
<p>Roly International was the most active with 8.61 million shares trade, but the price was unchanged at S$0.675.</p>
