<p>A two-day trip home was enough to rekindle media speculation on Wednesday that Real Madrid's Italian coach Fabio Capello will rejoin his former club AC Milan next season.</p>
<p>For several weeks, Italian commentators have suggested that Milan's owner-chairman, media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, wants to recall Capello in a bid to rejuvenate Milan after a disastrous season.</p>
<p>With six games to play, Milan are 10th in serie A and risk failing to qualify for European competition at the end of a campaign in which they have been knocked out of both the Champions' League and the Italian Cup.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at Milan's Linate airport on Tuesday, Capello refused to discuss his future plans.</p>
<p>"I've come back to Milan to see my family and for two days I don't want to talk football... I won't be seeing Berlusconi and I've no intention of discussing Milan's affairs. I am coach to Real and I've got my own problems...</p>
<p>"My future plans are top secret...but until things are absolutely certain I don't want to talk about them either in Italy or in Spain".</p>
<p>But newspapers remain convinced Capello's return trip to Italy was partly motivated by the need to consider the terms of a three-year contract, reportedly offered by Milan, worth an annual $1.8 million dollars.</p>
<p>Milan-based sports daily Gazzetta Dello Sport and daily Corriere Della Sera both highlight a cryptic exchange between Capello and a Milan fan at the airport which the papers suggested was evidence of an imminent return to Italy.</p>
<p>The fan told Capello his return to Milan would be like "reheating old soup". Capello replied: "O.K. then, we'll eat this warmed-up soup".</p>
<p>Both papers drew attention to a reported meeting in Madrid last week between Capello and Marcello Dell'Utri, one of Berlusconi's closest advisors, claiming a copy of a new contract was presented to Capello.</p>
<p>Italian commentators argue Capello will find it impossible to say no to Berlusconi because of a debt he feels he owes him.</p>
<p>Prior to a spectacularly successful five-year spell as Milan coach from 1991-96 Capello had been groomed for a job as sports manager within Berlusconi's Fininvest company.</p>
<p>If Capello is called in to take over at Milan next season the move will represent yet another painful reverse for current Milan coach Arrigo Sacchi.</p>
<p>Winner of one Italian league title and two Champions Cups as Milan coach from 1987-91, Sacchi proved highly controversial as national team coach from 1991-96.</p>
<p>Sacchi's return to Milan this season has not brought miracles.</p>
<p>Milan have won six, lost seven and drawn four of their 17 serie A matches under his leadership and were recently humiliated 6-1 at home to Juventus and 3-1 to city rivals Internazionale.</p>
