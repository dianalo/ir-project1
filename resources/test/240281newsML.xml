<headline>Germany's Haspa bids for Hamburgische Landesbank.</headline>
<dateline>HAMBURG, Germany 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hamburger Sparkasse, Germany's largest savings bank, on Friday said it had bid for a majority stake in publicly-owned Hamburgische Landesbank, which ranks among Germany's largest by balance sheet size.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the bank said in response to a Reuters inquiry: "We have handed in an offer for 51 percent."</p>
<p>The bank, known as Haspa, would give no further details, saying the next step was not in its hands. Hamburgische Landesbank, with total assets of some 100 billion marks ($65.1 billion), is 100 percent owned by the city of Hamburg.</p>
<p>The move is the latest in a series of shifts in the top tiers of the German banking sector, where mergers and co-operations are seen as inevitable to solve overcapacity in the sector.</p>
<p>Norddeutsche Landesbank, also state-owned, is to start serious merger talks with Bankgesellschaft Berlin early next year.</p>
<p>Local newspaper Hamburger Abendblatt will report in its Saturday edition that a decision on the sale of the bank could be made by Christmas.</p>
<p>The paper said U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs was handling the deal and that rival bids had been submitted by one foreign bank and by Norddeutsche Landesbank. Norddeutsche was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The newspaper also said the city of Hamburg had originally wanted to sell only a minority stake in Hamburgische Landesbank, and that a majority sale would require the bank to change its legal status to that of a limited company.</p>
<p>The 170-year-old Haspa is the largest of Germany's several hundred savings banks with a balance sheet total of some 40 billion marks.</p>
<p>The bank deals primarily with retail and small corporate clients and is the primary bank for over half of Hamburg residents and has 6,200 staff.</p>
