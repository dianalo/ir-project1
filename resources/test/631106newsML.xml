<headline>BA/EU reticent after talks on AMR deal.</headline>

<p>British Airways and the European Commission, meeting for the first time since Britain's government change on May 1, gave little away after talks on BA's planned partnership with AMR Corp's American Airlines.</p>
<p>"It was a friendly meeting held in a constructive atmosphere," was all British Airways would say in a statement after talks between chief executive Robert Ayling and European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert.</p>
<p>The Commission itself refused to comment.</p>
<p>Renewed face-to-face contacts come amid friendlier noises on all sides since the British Labour party's election victory.</p>
<p>Gone is the cross-Channel slanging match over whether London or Brussels has jurisdiction to rule on the deal, leaving parties to return to the detail of a competition case which has dragged on for nearly a year.</p>
<p>On the table is last December's proposal by Britain's Office of Fair Trading that BA and American release 168 weekly take-off and landing slots at London Heathrow -- enough to operate 12 daily return flights -- to make room for competitors.</p>
<p>While British Airways called the figure "excessive", rival airlines and the European Commission have said more concessions were needed if BA and American were to be prevented from dominating the Anglo-U.S. market.</p>
<p>Apart from the horse-trading on slots, parties must also find a compromise on the issue of how slots are released.</p>
<p>Van Miert told the then trade minister Ian Lang in a letter in January that the slots could only be surrendered, not sold.</p>
<p>British Airways remains at odds with Van Miert on the legality of sales, with the airline saying they are allowed because EU rules do not expressly forbid them.</p>
<p>As so often in EU law, the defintive answer lies at the end of several costly years in the European Courts which means a decision on BA and American's slots is likely to be a compromise, perhaps involving some form of slot bartering which stops short of cash payment.</p>
