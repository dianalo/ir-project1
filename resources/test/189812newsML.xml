<p>Prime Minister John Major got a boost on Thursday from evidence of a revival in support for his Conservative party, but the good news was blunted by inflation data pointing to a politically damaging rise in interest rates.</p>
<p>Growing economic optimism lifted the Conservatives to 33 percent in a MORI opinion poll published in The Times newspaper, compared with 28 percent two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Although they were still 17 percentage points adrift of Tony Blair's Labour party, it was the Conservatives' best showing in a MORI poll since early 1993 and raised party strategists' hopes of a fightback in time for the general election, due by May 22.</p>
<p>The last poll put them 28 points behind. Polls have fluctuated recently though analysts see a steady underlying trend to the ruling party. Economic performance may be decisive.</p>
<p>Official figures showing underlying inflation rose to a three-year high of 3.3 percent in October took the shine off the polling evidence and prompted Labour to mount a new attack on Major's claim to be turning Britain into an economic powerhouse.</p>
<p>"Within two months of declaring an economic miracle, the cracks are already appearing. Today's news makes a mockery of the prime minister's claim that he had conquered inflation," Labour's economics spokesman, Gordon Brown, told reporters.</p>
<p>Economists said the pick-up in inflation, from 2.9 percent in September, would make it hard for the government to hit its target of 2.5 percent without raising interest rates again.</p>
<p>"Labour has always said that unless this recovery is built on a solid foundation of an investment-rich economy, then interest rates and inflation would rise, hitting homeowners and businesses hard," Brown told a news conference.</p>
<p>Finance minister Kenneth Clarke, who raised interest rates to 6.0 percent from 5.75 percent on October 30, repeated his determination to hit his inflation target.</p>
<p>But he said Britain was enjoying the lowest inflation in 50 years and explained the jump in prices last month as mainly a statistical quirk.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, mounting inflationary pressures will make it harder for Clarke to deliver the tax cuts in his budget on November 26 that rank-and-file Conservative members of parliament are hoping for to boost their electoral chances.</p>
<p>The Conservatives, in power since 1979, still have a mountain to climb to win their fifth general election in a row.</p>
<p>At a similar stage before the 1992 election, Labour was just fractionally ahead in the opinion polls.</p>
<p>One Conservative candidate, supermarket magnate Archie Norman, embarrassed the party by frankly admitting in a magazine interview on Thursday that Labour might win the election.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that Major, with a majority of just one in the 651-seat lower House of Commons, will even survive until next spring.</p>
<p>His vulnerability was exposed on Wednesday evening when the government scraped home by just one vote after a debate on its handling of the crisis over mad cow disease. Defeat would not have brought down the government, but it could have faced a nail-biting vote of confidence.</p>
<p>The vote was close because Northern Irish MPs who often back Major deserted him in fury over the government's failure to get the European Union to start easing a ban on British beef exports it imposed due to fears mad cow disease could spread to humans.</p>
<p>With two by-elections in the new year likely to put Major into an overall minority, the influence in particular of the nine MPs of the Ulster Unionist Party is set to grow further.</p>
<p>"If a confidence vote arises in January, February or March we shall look at the issues on its merits. We will decide when the time comes," party leader David Trimble said on Thursday.</p>
