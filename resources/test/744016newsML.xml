<p>Norwegian metals producer Elkem ASA said on Monday its new chrome ore business in Brazil has a production capacity of between 200,000 and 300,000 tonnes per year.</p>
<p>Elkem spokesman Ola Boesterud would not say how much Elkem was paying the Caemi Group for the ore mine and related licence rights in the Vila Nova region in Amapa state in northeast Brazil.</p>
<p>But he said the acquisition was of strategic significance.</p>
<p>"It is strategically important that Elkem Rana is vertically integrated in the ore activity," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Elkem earlier announced that the acquisition formed part of the company's strategy to ensure Elem Rana has long-term chrome ore reserves.</p>
