<p>French carmaker Renault SA maintains its target to control over 10 percent of the European car market at the end of 1997, marketing director for Europe Philippe Gamba said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Our target is 10-10.5 percent of the European market by the end of the year," Gamba told a news conference on the group's first half commercial results.</p>
<p>He said Renault hoped to improve market shares in France from the 26.6 percent achieved in 1996. For Europe, excluding France, Renault wants to maintain, "possibly exceed" the market share of 7.3 percent achieved in the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>Around the year 2000, "We want to reach eight percent of the European market, excluding France, despite competition from new rivals such as the Japanese or the Koreans," he said.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1997 Renault raised its market share in the western Europe, excluding France, to 7.3 percent from 6.8 percent.</p>
<p>Taking into account a sharp fall in the French market, its market share in 17 European countries eased to 9.4 percent from 9.8 percent in the first six months of 1996.</p>
<p>Commenting on the break-even target set by group chairman Louis Schweitzer for the car operations and for the group's result before taxes, he said "We are on that trend."</p>
