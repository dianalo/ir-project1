<p>A state legislator opposed to building a new Minnesota Twins stadium proposed raising money through video games at a race track to keep the team playing in its current home.</p>
<p>Rep. Todd Van Dellen, R-Plymouth, told Reuters Friday the metropolitan sports facilities commission could use revenue from slot machines at the Canterbury Downs horse racing track to buy enough baseball tickets to keep the team at the Metrodome.</p>
<p>If the team did raise enough money this year, it would be unable to opt out of its lease at the Metrodome, which runs until 2011. The team has an escape window from the lease in 1998 if ticket sales fall below 80 percent of the American League average or if it loses money in 1995, 1996 and 1997, Van Dellen noted.</p>
<p>The team posted losses in both 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>The team and Minnesota Governor Arnie Carlson would prefer to build a new $300 million stadium, and there is a proposal in the state legislature to build it.</p>
<p>Van Dellen, however, said a new stadium would be "too expensive," given that $20 million could tie them to the Metrodome for the next 14 years.</p>
<p>Van Dellen said he would add his proposal as an amendment to existing legislation.</p>
<p>A state House committee voted on Wednesday not to advance a bill to help finance the stadium. The bill's sponsors had not yet decided how to respond to the House Local Government and Metropolitan Affairs Committee vote.</p>
<p>A Senate committee earlier eliminated public funding for the stadium. The stadium is expected to cost $250 million to $300 million or more if a retractable roof is added.</p>
