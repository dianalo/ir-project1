<p>Opposition parties suspended their role in the Central African Republic government on Monday and called for a general strike on Tuesday over the killing of three disaffected soldiers.</p>
<p>"The group of 11 opposition political parties holds President Ange-Felix Patasse responsible for the murder of the three ex-mutineers," a joint statement from the parties said.</p>
<p>The statement called on the public to stay home on Tuesday to protest against Friday's killings.</p>
<p>Three soldiers, who took part in army mutinees which erupted three times in little more than a year, were killed by security forces under circumstances which a government statement at the time did not make clear.</p>
<p>Independent sources allege the three were disarmed before they were killed by the paramilitary police.</p>
<p>The opposition parties, who called for an inquiry into the killings, have held eight of 27 government posts since February, as part of a deal to restore peace after the mutinies which began over pay but became a campaign to oust Patasse.</p>
<p>The first mutinies were in April and May 1996. The third, which began on November 15, degenerated into ethnic bloodshed. French troops, in the country under a defence pact, restored order and handed over to African peacekeepers.</p>
<p>The mutineers are principally from the southern Yakoma tribe of former military leader Andre Kolingba. Patasse is a northern civilian elected in 1993.</p>
