<p>The Common Fund for Commodities, a U.N. affiliate, said on Thursday it had approved a $1.1 million grant to encourage the use of energy-efficient equipment by the copper industry in developing countries.</p>
<p>The project, submitted to the Fund by the Lisbon-based International Copper Study Group, will be piloted in China and India and executed by Britain's International Institute for Energy Conservation.</p>
<p>The copper industry will contribute an additional $1.2 million to the project via the International Copper Association and China and India will also provide top-up funds, it added.</p>
<p>"Both in China and India an explosive growth is expected for energy and energy-related services. The project will therefore support the indigenous production of energy-efficient, copper intensive products, and ensure the availability of these products at affordable prices," the Fund said in a statement.</p>
<p>Beyond the pilot stage, the Common Fund envisages that the beneficiaries of the project will be copper-producing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.</p>
<p>"Developing countries that may adopt the new approaches to be promoted will gain substantial savings in their energy costs," it said. --Amsterdam Newsroom +31 20 504 5000</p>
