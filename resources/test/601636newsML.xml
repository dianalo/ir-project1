<p>The volume of Russian deliveries of platinum group metals over 1997 will be about the same as in 1996, a source at Almazjuvelirexport, the state precious metals export agency, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The volumes for this year will be approximately what they were in 1996, even though this year we will start deliveries later," said the source, who also confirmed previous comments by officials that deliveries to Japan would probably begin in the first half of June.  </p>
<p>The source said that only "technical" issues remained to be worked out in the contracts for Russian PGM deliveries to Japan, since a May 5 decree signed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had already outlined the volumes and terms of deliveries.</p>
<p>"The matter has been decided," the source said. "There are some technical issues being resolved."</p>
<p>Talks between Japan -- the world's largest consumer of platinum and palladium -- and Russia -- the world's largest palladium supplier and second largest platinum supplier -- had been taking place in Moscow and would continue in June, the source said.</p>
<p>He declined to provide any details on Russian reserves or contract volumes. Palladium prices hit two-year highs last week on jitters over delays in the Russia-Japan talks.</p>
