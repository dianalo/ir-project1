<p>U.S. Department of Agriculture Dairy, Livestock and Poultry Division Director John Reddington said Thursday he expected a quick resolution to a Chinese stoppage of poultry imports from 10 U.S. states.</p>
<p>"When we sit down with the Chinese government in cases like this the problem usually disappears," Reddington told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said there were no cases of avian influenza in the United States at present, and he expected Chinese officials to accept the situation.  </p>
<p>Reddington said it was not clear if the stoppage affected shipments to one or more Chinese provinces or to the whole country.</p>
<p>He said he did not have the full list of the 10 affected U.S. states but said they included Arkansas, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina and Utah.</p>
<p>No other major poultry producing states were affected, he said.</p>
