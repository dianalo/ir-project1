<p>DSP Communications Inc and Proxim Inc said Tuesday their boards had approved a merger through a tax-free exchange of shares valued at about $400 million, based on DSPC's closing stock price on October 28.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Proxim stockholders will receive 0.70 share of DSPC for each Proxim share, subject to adjustment.  </p>
<p>The merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization and a pooling of interests. It is expected to close by the end of January and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Based on the number of new shares to be issued by DSPC and the closing price for DSPC common stock on October 28, the combined company would have a market capitalization of about $1.7 billion, the companies said.</p>
<p>The combined company will be a powerful force in both the indoor and outdoor wireless voice and data communications markets, they said.</p>
