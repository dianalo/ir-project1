<p>Copper prices broke above the $2,440 a tonne level during early Thursday London Metal Exchange (LME) trading - the highest the market has been since early June 1996.</p>
<p>Three months was at $2,447/50 a tonne, well above the $2,414 Wednesday official close, spurred higher by speculative investment fund buying overnight, traders said.  </p>
<p>"It (copper) had been trying to clear $2,440 all morning, but people were bit wary because there has been some forward sales recently," a LME trader said.</p>
<p>However, once $2,440 was conclusively hurdled, the market sped higher to near $2,460 as pre-programmed buy orders were triggered, traders added.</p>
<p>The stimulus for current strength in copper was provided by a 3,225-tonne drop in LME warehouse stocks of metal. This trend was likely to continue, as nearby supplies are thin on the ground, analysts said.</p>
<p>Copper consumption has been good so far this year, which is helping to offset increased mine supply, analysts said.</p>
