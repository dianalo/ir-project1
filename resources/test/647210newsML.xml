<p>Convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh saved another soldier's life in the Gulf War and helped others with their problems, a jury weighing whether to sentence him to death heard on Monday.</p>
<p>Capt. Jesus Angel Rodriguez, McVeigh's commanding officer during the Gulf War, testified that McVeigh gave first aid to another soldier who was hit by shrapnel when a grenade he had fired ricocheted during the 1991 war.</p>
<p>The soldier had shrapnel sticking out of his arms and was bleeding profusely, Rodriguez said.</p>
<p>McVeigh, a "combat lifesaver," gave first aid to the injured soldier and "basically saved his life," Rodriguez said. He said he recommended McVeigh for an award for his actions, but he was not given one.</p>
<p>The jury of seven men and five women that found McVeigh guilty last week of blowing up the Alfred P. Murrah federal building, killing 168 people in the worst mass murder in U.S. history, was weighing whether he should be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>The defence, which was trying to persuade the jury to spare McVeigh's life, has called former Army colleagues and neighbours since last Friday to testify about McVeigh's background.</p>
<p>They have portrayed him as the "kid next door," a young man no different from millions of other Americans.</p>
<p>But the prosecution, which is pressing for the death penalty, has stressed that none of the defence witnesses called so far kept in touch with McVeigh after 1991 or 1992.</p>
<p>Defence attorney Richard Burr said on Friday that the defence would also show how McVeigh was disturbed by the federal raid on the Branch Davidian cult compound at Waco, Texas in 1993. About 80 cult members died in the confrontation.</p>
<p>Burr said McVeigh concluded "that the government murdered people at Waco." The prosecution has said that McVeigh's anger drove him to bomb the Murrah building on the second anniversary of the fiery end of the Waco siege.</p>
<p>Four former Army colleagues gave glowing testimonials about McVeigh on Monday, saying he was a model soldier and a caring person.</p>
<p>Rodriguez said that when he had to return to the United States because his brother-in-law had been killed in an accident, McVeigh was "really compassionate." "He showed that he really cared," he said.</p>
<p>"Sgt. McVeigh was an outstanding soldier. He did what he was told, anticipated what had to be done (and) took pride in his work," Rodriguez said.</p>
<p>McVeigh, sitting at the defence table, smiled when Rodriguez told of McVeigh's fondness for strawberry pop tarts.</p>
<p>The defence has tried to make McVeigh seem a normal person to the jury by bringing out human details, such as that he had bedsheets with the comic strip cat "Garfield" on them.</p>
<p>Under questioning from the prosecution, Rodriguez denied McVeigh ever fired after the order to cease fire was given.</p>
