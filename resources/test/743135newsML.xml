<p>Latin American ADRs largely eased Monday, weighed down by the rest of Wall Street and continuing jitters about Brazil's currency, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>"Everybody is just focusing on the U.S., with all the (recent news) articles comparing the market with 1929 and 1987," a Latin American trader said, referring to historic Wall Street crashes.</p>
<p>"Latin America is able to stabilize, but not until the U.S. stabilizes," he said.  </p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, following its 130-point plunge on Friday, was down 15 points at 7875, and declining issues outnumbered winners by better than two to one. The Nasdaq composite index was off 10.04 points to 1537.95.</p>
<p>Among leading regional ADRs -- American Depositary Receipts -- Telefonos de Mexico  fell 10/16 to 49-11/16 and Argentine oil company YPF SA fell 1/2 to 29-1/4.</p>
<p>Telefonica del Peru was off 10/16 to 23-1/16, while Brazilian telephone holding Telebras SA rose 1-1/2 to 130-3/8.  </p>
<p>Telefonos de Mexico and Telebras were among the most active issues on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Latin American markets, which rose almost 49 percent this year through July 10, have been rattled by concerns that turmoil in Asian currency markets could spread to Brazil.</p>
<p>Rehan Chaudri, an international securities analyst at Brandywine Asset Management Inc in Wilmington, Del., said Brazil's currency could continue under pressure from speculators for five or six months.  </p>
<p>"The speculators will keep coming back," he said. "... We would shy away for the next few weeks."</p>
<p>Robert Pelosky, Latin American equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, wrote in an analysis that jitters over Asian currencies were unlikely to lead to a quickened devaluation in Brazil.</p>
<p>"Our best idea is to take advantage of Brazil-inspired weakness to buy Mexico, our favorite market for the second half" of 1997, he wrote.  </p>
<p>European ADRs also were largely lower on the Dow's sag. Among active ADRs, British Telecommunications fell 1-14/16 to 70-13/16 amid concerns that its planned merger with MCI Communications Corp might have to be renegotiated.</p>
<p>Royal Dutch Petroleum Co rose 1/8 to 53-1/2, and Canada's Gandalf Technologies Inc rose 11/16 to 29/16.</p>
