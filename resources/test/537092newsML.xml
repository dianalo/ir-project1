<p>Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel Plc/SA said on Thursday a steering committee of banks had agreed a debt restructuring plan, which would ensure the financial stability of the company for the six years.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement it was the board's view that the restructuring plan was the "best possible compromise under present conditions".</p>
<p>"The main merit (of the plan) is to ensure the financial stability of the group for the six years to come, allowing the management to focus principally on the improvement of the Group's performance, while shareholders will have the opportunity to keep a right to 54.5 percent of the long term potential profits," the group said.</p>
<p>Following negotiations with the small group of Eurotunnel's syndicate of banks for restructuring its nine billion pounds ($14.6 billion) of debt, an agreement was reached and a formal document is being prepared.</p>
<p>Details of the plan will be sent in the "near future" to shareholders. It confirmed that a combined general meeting of Eurotunnel SA will be held in Paris on June 24 when shareholders have the chance to approve the plan. Eurotunnel Plc will hold an extraordinary general meeting on the same day.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel, which reported exceptional losses for the year after interest of 685 million pounds against 924 million the year before, said a favourable decision by the two governments to a "significant" extension of the 65-year concession would improve the position of shareholders and the company would be making every effort to obtain such an extension.</p>
