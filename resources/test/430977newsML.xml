<p>Imation Corp said it reached a development and business agreement with TeraStor Corp to develop media for a new class of rewritable mass storage based on TeraStor's Near Field Recording technology.</p>
<p>Imation said it gets semi-exclusive and long-term license to manufacture, based on the new technology, products which are expected to feature user capacities of about 20 gigabytes with performance comparable to hard disk drives.</p>
<p>Product introduction is targeted for the first half of 1998, the company said.</p>
<p>Near Field Recording technology creates a new category of multi-purpose mass storage technology, said Imation, recently spun off from Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co.</p>
