<p>Emerging market analysts' latest trade recommendations focused on Brazil, Russia, Turkey and Romania. Bank of America recommends buying Romania's Eurodollar bond due 1999 as spreads have narrowed.</p>
<p>Romania has announced a programme for "Economic Salvation' which will push through various market-oriented reforms in the coming year, Bank of America said.</p>
<p>"This is good news for Romania despite the high inflation, unemployment and social disruption it will cause in 1997," it said, adding Romania was on course to emulate Hungary's stabilisation, with the added benefit of low external debt.</p>
<p>Following are the latest trade ideas, compiled by Reuters:</p>
<p>Bank of America recommends:</p>
<p>    BUY	 Romania 9.75 pct 1999 (dollars)</p>
<p>STRATEGY  Spreads on Romanian Eurobond debt have narrowed considerably. The buy recommendation has tightened from a high of 322 b.p. in December 1996 to a present level of 235 b.p. over U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>Bank of America believe there is room for spreads to tighten to 175 b.p. by the year-end, with further upside potential in 1998.</p>
<p>HSBC Markets recommends:</p>
<p>    BUY	 Companhia Energetica de Sao Paulo (CESP) 9.25 pct</p>
<p>		  2001 (marks)</p>
<p>    SELL	Brazil 8.875 pct 2001 (dollars)</p>
<p>STRATEGY  On the buy side CESP is guaranteed by Brazil and represents a discrepancy in the market. It is trading at Libor plus 212 basis points compared with the Brazil bond which is trading at Libor plus 189 b.p.</p>
<p>    BUY	 Russia 9.25 pct 2001 (dollars) rated Ba2/BB-</p>
<p>    SELL	Kazakhstan 9.25 pct 1999 (dollars) rated Ba3/BB-</p>
<p>STRATEGY  This switch between bonds with similar credit ratings and regions allows for around a 70 b.p. pick-up despite Kazakhstan being shorter by two years.</p>
<p>    BUY	 Halk Bank 8.0 pct 2002 (marks)</p>
<p>    SELL	Turkey 7.75 pct 2004 (marks)</p>
<p>STRATEGY  Halk Bank at Libor plus 320 b.p. compares with Turkey at Libor plus 209 b.p. and is 99 percent owned by Turkey with an ownership clause that ensures Turkey will remain a majority shareholder.</p>
