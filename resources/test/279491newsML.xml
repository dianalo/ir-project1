<p>Hong Kong stocks are likely to see relatively quiet trade in the coming shortened trading week, with any rally led more by the retail sector than institutions, brokers and analysts said.</p>
<p>"It is likely to be a quiet week, but with possibly some futures-related buying on Monday," said James Osborn of institutional sales at ING Barings. The December Hang Seng Index futures contract will expire on Monday, December 30.</p>
<p>The index could see some upside towards the end of the week with demand coming from individual investors, Osborn added.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng advanced 65.53 points to 13,404.14 on Friday. Over the three-day trading week, shortened by the Christmas holidays, the index climbed 272.73 points, or 2.08 percent.</p>
<p>The coming week will be short as well. The exchange will hold only a morning session on Tuesday, close for the New Year holiday on Wednsday, and resume normal trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>Brokers and analysts remain bullish on the outlook for the market, chiefly due to the outlook for low or declining inflation and the positive impact that trend will have on interest rates and the local property market.</p>
<p>"We won't see an interest hike in the next three months," said Charles Cheung of J&amp;A Securities, adding there was nothing in the U.S. price structure to suggest one might be necessary.</p>
<p>This low-inflation, low-interest scenario for the United States and Hong Kong means that required yields will fall as capital values rise, according to market strategists.</p>
<p>"All the yields on Hong Kong dollar financial assets are coming in line with U.S. financial assets, and we are now at a stage when the stock market is also doing the same thing," said Jake van der Kamp, investment strategist at HG Asia.</p>
<p>Van der Kamp said he did not think that U.S. assets were currently priced too high.</p>
<p>Overseas-based institutions, no longer worried about and discounting the outlook after June 30, 1997, when Britain hands Hong Kong back to China, are giving the dollar-based Hong Kong market the same rating as the U.S. market, said Van der Kamp.</p>
<p>On this basis the Hang Seng Index should rise to 15,000 in 1997, he said.</p>
<p>"We could overshoot and hit 18,000 but 15,000 will be no problem," said van der Kamp.</p>
<p>Technical analysis supports this scenario.</p>
<p>Short-term selling pressure has evaporated, the index has built a good base at the 12,700 level and upside lies at 14,300, said J&amp;A's Cheung.</p>
<p>"We should see another 800 points upside, from 13,500 (the previous record close) to 14,300 in the first quarter," said Cheung.</p>
<p>Property and property-related blue chips are likely to lead the market, said van der Kamp, adding yields on grade A commercial property will fall in line with yields on U.S. property as prices or capital values rise.</p>
