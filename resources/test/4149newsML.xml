<p>Pacific Bell, a unit of Pacific Telesis Group, said it had been unable to negotiate an agreement with AT&amp;T Corp to interconnect the companies' networks.</p>
<p>In a statement late on Monday, Pacific Bell said AT&amp;T was expected to file a request early this week with the California Public Utilities Commission for arbitration proceedings in order to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>"We've been trying very hard over the past months to reach agreement on the terms and conditions for interconnecting our networks," said Liz Fetter, president of Pacific Bell's Industry Markets Group. "While we've made progress on many of the issues, several significant ones remain unresolved."</p>
<p>Pacific Bell is negotiating under guidelines issued by the utilities panel for opening up its statewide network to competitors certified to provide local phone service in California.</p>
