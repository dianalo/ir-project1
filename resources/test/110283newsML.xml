<p>Rosie Boycott has been appointed editor of Britain's Independent On Sunday, officials at the newspaper said on Friday.</p>
<p>Boycott, currently editor of Esquire magazine, will replace Peter Wilby, 51, who is leaving the newspaper after 18 months.</p>
<p>Boycott, who will be the only woman editor of a broadsheet newspaper, is expected to take up her post shortly.</p>
<p>Boycott, 44, launched feminist magazine Spare Rib in the early 1970s and was appointed editor of men's magazine Esquire five years ago.</p>
<p>Latest circulation figures show that the Independent is the weakest seller among Britain's four Sunday "qualities".</p>
<p>Its average sale over the six months to August was slightly under 300,000. The market leading Sunday Times sold an average of 1.29 million copies weekly in the same period.</p>
<p>Mirror Group and Independent Newspapers are the main shareholders in Newspaper Publishing, the company which produces the daily Independent and its Sunday sister.</p>
