<p>British rail infrastructure company Railtrack Plc said on Tuesday it had agreed to upgrade Britain's west coast mainline railway at a cost of 1.5 billion stg with the government's Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (OPRAF).</p>
<p>As a result OPRAF said in a joint statement it was seeking offers to operate passenger rail services on the line under a 15-year franchise which would replace the existing rolling stock with new high speed trains.  </p>
<p>OPRAF said that following the commitment from Railtrack it issued an Information Memorandum to prospective bidders on Monday for both the InterCity West Coast and for the North London Railways passenger service operating franchises.</p>
<p>These are the last of the 25 regional passenger service franchises to be put up for tender under the government's sell-off of the former British Rail network.</p>
<p>It said 14 prospective bidders registered their interest for the Inter-City West Coast (ICWC) franchise, the busiest route in the country, running from London to the Midlands, northwest England and Scotland.  </p>
<p>Salmon said he expects the new operating franchise, due to be awarded next March, will give passengers much faster services, typically cutting journey times from London to Manchester to two hours from 2-1/2 hours and from London to Glasgow to four hours and 20 minutes from the current five to 5-1/2.</p>
<p>"The agreement which OPRAF has successfully negotiated with Railtrack offers the real prospect of a step change in journey times and quality on the West Coast Mainline," Salmon said in the statement.  </p>
<p>"I am now laying down a challenge to the new rail industry to build on this platform by submitting exciting innovative bids which will revolutionise services to Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow from London."</p>
<p>OPRAF said replacing the entire ICWC rolling stock fleet could cost 500 million stg for 35 to 36 trains, which could travel at up to 200 kilometres an hour compared to the current maximum of 175 km/h.</p>
<p>Railtrack said the upgrade work will replace the signalling with a new radio-based in-cab system and centralise the control centre, as well as improving track and power supplies.  </p>
<p>Railtrack chairman Robert Horton said the infrastructure programme would cost a basic 1.35 billion stg plus 150 million stg to upgrade the system to take the faster tilting trains.</p>
<p>Salmon later made clear at a news conference that Railtrack was making the tilt-train upgrade available on the understanding that the franchisee would pay with higher track access charges.</p>
<p>Consequently bidders have been told they must make two bids, one with the faster tilt-train option and one without.</p>
<p>But Salmon said he expected that tilt trains would come out as the more economically viable solution because they would attract more passengers.</p>
<p>Horton told reporters the important trunk route has long been in need of modernisation but there had been a lack of funding until Railtrack was privatised earlier this year.</p>
