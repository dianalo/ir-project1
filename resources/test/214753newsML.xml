<p>British Airways Plc said Monday it was in talks with a number of interested parties about the potential sales of its Ground Fleet Services operation based at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports.</p>
<p>It said the potential sale is part of the airline's ambitious efficiency Programme announced earlier this year, which aims to find a billion sterling in annual cost savings over the next three years.</p>
<p>Ground Fleet Services employs 470 and provides specialist ground equipment and leased vehicles to operators at both airports, maintaining a fleet of 7,300 vehicles.</p>
<p>British Airways said if a sale was concluded most staff would transfer to the new company, although some may be offered voluntary severance or early retirement. It said a firm decision on the future of the unit was expected in the new year.</p>
<p>"The potential buyers are world class operators in their own right and would, therefore, we believe, be good employers," chief executive Robert Ayling said in a statement.</p>
<p>"We believe today's announcement presents the best way forward for Ground Fleet Services and its employees, who would benefit from the focus and expertise of a company which specialises in this business," he said.</p>
<p>"We are committed to ensuring that employees of Ground Fleet Services are treated in the best possible way."</p>
<p>The move follows British Airway's decision in September to close its Contract Handling unit at Heathrow providing ticketing, check-in, cargo and other services for other airlines at the airport.</p>
