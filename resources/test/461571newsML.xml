<p>Two buses collided on one of Colombia's main highways on Saturday, killing five people and injuring more than 30 others, Red Cross officials said.</p>
<p>The accident took place on the freeway between Bogota and Medellin, the country's third largest city, forcing police to close the road for more than an hour.</p>
<p>Red Cross spokesman Nicolas Perez told reporters most of the dead and injured were going on vacation at the start of Easter week. The exact cause of the crash was under investigation, Perez said.</p>
