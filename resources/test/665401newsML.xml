<p>Tricord Systems Inc said Monday a federal jury in St. Paul, Minnesota absolved the company of any liability in a class action lawsuit alleging securities fraud.</p>
<p>Tricord said the jury found the company and two of its officers were not engaged in any wrongdoing. The plaintiff class had claimed that in early 1994 Tricord had made misrepresentations about its future revenue prospects.  </p>
<p>The company issued a press release on July 1, 1994 indicating that results for the second quarter of 1994 were expected to be less than previously projected. After the release, Tricord said a number of class action suits were filed against the company and the two officers claiming violations of federal securities law.</p>
<p>The class was represented by Karl Cambronne of the Minneapolis firm Chestnut &amp; Brooks. Sarah Wolff and Arnold Pagniucci of the Chicago firm Sachnoff &amp; Weaver represented Tricord and the officers.</p>
