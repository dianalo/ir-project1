<p>An hour of intense gunfire rocked the Burundian capital on Tuesday night in what appeared to be the first battle close to the city since a coup d'etat on July 25.</p>
<p>Heavy machinegun fire and multiple bursts of automatic rifle fire could heard around the city's university at the foot of the hills surrounding Bujumbura.</p>
<p>Dozens of grenade explosions and several rounds of tracer lit up the sky in the same area.</p>
<p>The fighting started at curfew, 10 p.m. (2000 GMT), and gunfire could also be heard in at least two other locations in the city's eastern suburbs.</p>
<p>There were no details of casualties and no military spokesman was available for comment.</p>
<p>Hutu rebels earlier launched three 60mm mortar bombs at the university, injuring no one and causing slight damage, according to military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Isaie Nibizi.</p>
<p>Burundi's capital has been largely free from violence since military strongman Pierre Buyoya, an ethnic Tutsi, came to power in an army coup d'etat in July that ousted a Hutu president.</p>
<p>The city, which is Tutsi-controlled after a bout of ethnic cleansing last year, is considered highly vulnerable to attack from Hutu rebels because of its position between the north east shore of lake Tanganyika and a range of steep hills.</p>
<p>Around 150,000 people -- mainly civilians -- have died in inter-ethnic fighting in Burundi since 1993 when the country's first democratically-elected Hutu president was killed in an attempted coup.</p>
<p>Hutu rebels launched a major attack against a commune in north western Kayanza region on Tuesday morning, killing the local administrator and leaving many civilians dead, according to a senior government official.</p>
<p>The rebels attacked Gahombo, a commune midway between Kayanza and Ngozi early on Tuesday in the latest of a series of rebel operations in the region.</p>
<p>"The rebels attacked the military post, the displaced camp and the administrative headquarters. It was a big attack and it is still continuing. We have sent for reinforcements," Nibizi earlier told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The rebels perpetrated a major attack at Gahombo. They have killed the local administrator and there are many civilian casualties as well," presidential spokesman Jean-Luc Ndizeye told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>The United Nations last week told Burundi's coup leaders to start all-party negotiations within 60 days or face possible sanctions.</p>
<p>The economy of the central African country, based on coffee and tea, has been crippled by sanctions imposed after the coup by East African states.</p>
<p>Hutu rebels stepped up attacks in Kayanza region last week, operating from the nearby Kibira forest, an area off-limits to Burundi's army, according to analysts.</p>
<p>Burundi's army on Monday accused Hutu rebels of killing civilians during heavy fighting at Gatara village, around 5 km (three miles) south of Kayanza town on Saturday.</p>
<p>Dozens of government buildings were looted and burned during the attack, state radio reported, but gave no details of casualty figures.</p>
<p>"The rebels said they had finished with Gatara because they had completely destroyed all the administrative buildings. They said their mission was to do likewise throughout the rest of the country," the eyewitness told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Rebels last week staged a series of ambushes on national route one, Burundi's most important road, which runs through Kayzanza.</p>
<p>London-based human rights group Amnesty International last month reported that the Burundi's army killed 4,050 unarmed civilians in central Giheta district in the first three weeks after the July coup. The army denied the report.</p>
