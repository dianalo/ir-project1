<p>NYMEX electricity futures were trading higher Friday in thin volume on rumors surrounding a power unit outage and some shortcovering, industry sources said.</p>
<p>As of 1250 EDT, NYMEX Palo Verde (PV) futures were trading up 80 cents at the day's high of $31.75 per megawatt hour (MWh) following trade as low as $31.25, while October was trading up 50 cents at the day's high of $24.00 per MWh.</p>
<p>September California Oregon Border (COB) was trading up 45 cents at $23.60 per MWh, while October was up 15 cents at a new contract high of $23.50 after reaching as low as $22.40 per MWh.</p>
<p>NYMEX volumes were not immediately available, but were said to be very thin with many players attending a conference in Vancouver, B.C.</p>
<p>Some strength in PV futures came from rumors of an outage at the Four Corners coal-fired power plant in New Mexico, sources said. "There was some rumors of a plant outage," said one source.</p>
<p>However, the outage is expected to be short lived.</p>
<p>The 750 megawatt (MW) unit 5 at the Four Corners plant, shut late Thursday for repairs, was expected to resume operation Saturday, the operator said Friday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 220 MW Four Corners unit 3, resumed operation as expected early today. The other three Four Corners units, the 750 MW unit 4 and two 185 MW units (units 1 and 2) continued to operate at full output, he said.</p>
<p>"People also thought prices were going to go a little lower this morning, so there may have been some shortcovering in there," said one futures trader.</p>
<p>After pushing power demand to record highs this week, the sizzling heat that smothered most of the Southwest showed signs of losing its grip.</p>
<p>While some interior sections of the Southwest were still called to see triple-digit heat today, a cooling trend was expected to take root this weekend and bring temperatures back to seasonal summer levels, especially along the coast.</p>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, descent of an Arctic air mass early next week was forecast to push readings to as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit below normal in western Canada, Montana and Wyoming. The rest of the region was expected to experience near to slightly above normal temperatures.</p>
<p>Electricity output from the 1,221 MW Palo Verde nuclear power unit 3 in Wintersburg, Ariz., resumed full ouput early Friday after repairs to a condensate pump.</p>
<p>The adjacent 1,221 MW Palo Verde nuclear power unit 2 was operating at 90 percent of capacity as the unit coasts down to a scheduled refueling outage September 6.</p>
<p>The neighboring unit 1, also at 1,221 MW, dipped slightly to 98 percent power as of early Friday.</p>
