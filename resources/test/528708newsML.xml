<p>Sri Lankan soldiers killed at least five Tamil Tiger rebels believed to have taken part in an ambush in which 12 soldiers died, a military spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Troops surrounded the village of Kalmaru (in eastern Batticaloa district) where the rebels were hiding and shot and killed at least five of them. They recovered five bodies," the spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Military officials in the east said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels had taken refuge in the village after ambushing an army patrol on Monday near Valaichchenai, about 220 km (138 miles) east of the capital Colombo.</p>
<p>They said the village was home to several hundred refugees who have been displaced by fighting between the rebels and government troops.</p>
<p>Two civilians were killed in the crossfire and more than nine wounded, they added. Four soldiers also were wounded during the firefight.</p>
<p>The military spokesman in Colombo said he was unaware of any civilian casualties.</p>
<p>The LTTE, fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in predominantly Sinhalese Sri Lanka's north and east, were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the war, now in its 14th year. The LTTE say the number is higher.</p>
