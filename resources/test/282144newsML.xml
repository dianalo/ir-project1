<p>Business activity in the New York area soared to record levels in December, according to a widely watched barometer of the economy.</p>
<p>The National Association of Purchasing Management said Tuesday its New York Business Conditions Index soared this month to the highest level since it began to compile the figure almost four years ago.</p>
<p>The index rose to 72.9, compared with 64.9 in November.</p>
<p>"The December reading was the strongest pace since the survey began in May 1993," a NAPM report said.</p>
<p>NAPM compiles its New York index monthly from a survey of the region's purchasing executives. A reading above 50 denotes growth.</p>
<p>Non-manufacturing business in the New York region accelerated particularly quickly this month, causing most of the improvement in the overall index, the NAPM said.</p>
<p>The non-manufacturing activity gauge climbed to 74.4 in December from 63.1 the month before.</p>
<p>Architectural services, painting, engineering and construction all were "hot spots" in the month, NAPM said.</p>
<p>"Hot spot" businesses are those that have reported increasing prices and slowing delivery times for three consecutive months.</p>
<p>Factory business, however, grew more slowly in December after strong growth in November. NAPM's New York manufacturing index slid to 59.1 from 81.1 the month before.</p>
<p>In addition to reporting solid gains in December, purchasers were upbeat about future business conditions.</p>
<p>NAPM's New York business outlook index read 71.6 in December, just below November's 71.9 reading.</p>
<p>"Looking forward to the upcoming six months, purchasers' optimisim remained high," NAPM said.</p>
