<p>Shares in Cisco Systems Inc fell in after-hours trading Tuesday, immediately after the company released fourth quarter earnings that met Street expectations but missed the whisper.</p>
<p>Cisco shares dropped from a close of 81-15/16 down to 79-5/8 after the company reported a fourth quarter profit of $0.55 per share. Wall Street had expected the company to post $0.55 per share earnings, but traders said some unpublished forecasts had called for profits of up to $0.60 a share.</p>
<p>"There's still a good amount of interest in Cisco," one dealer said.  </p>
<p>Some analysts had expected Cisco earnings to exceed expectations, citing struggles among its competitors and the company's smooth management of a transition to new technology.</p>
<p>Including one-time charges, fourth quarter earnings for the world's biggest maker of networking gear were $0.22 per share. The company reported revenues of $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>Also moving lower after the bell was Viasoft Inc, which was trading at 63, down from a close of 64. The company reported fourth quarter earnings of $0.22 per share, above First Call's $0.19 per share consensus estimate.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange said session one had volume of 37,500, compared with 13,600 Monday and session two had volume of 320,241 compared with 4.1 million.</p>
