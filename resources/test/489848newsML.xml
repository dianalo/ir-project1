<p>Taiwan's top economic policy maker will visit seven Central American countries later in April to secure Taipei's formal ties with them amid increasing pressure from rival China, a local newspaper reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>The China Times said Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the cabinet's Council for Economic Planning and Development, planned to discuss Taiwan's trade relations with its allies in Central America -- which include Panama, Costa Rica and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>Offficials could not be reached for confirmation of the trip because of holiday.</p>
<p>The newspaper did not give details on Chiang's itinerary.</p>
<p>Taiwan says China has been trying to pressure the island's Central American allies to switch ties to Beijing since Panama invited Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to attend an international conference on the future of the Panama Canal in September.</p>
<p>China has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province not entitled to international recognition since the two split after a civil war in 1949.</p>
<p>Taiwan, which is formally recognised by only 30 countries despite prosperous trade ties with many more, lost a major diplomatic battle to China in 1996 when South Africa announced it would switch formal ties to Beijing by the end of 1997.</p>
