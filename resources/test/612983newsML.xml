<p>Iran's moderate former culture minister Mohammad Khatami was elected president on Saturday in a stunning upset victory over the Islamic republic's conservative establishment.</p>
<p>Final results showed Khatami winning 69 percent of the 29.1 million votes cast in Friday's nationwide ballot, seen by many as a referendum on 18 years of revolution.</p>
<p>His main rival, conservative parliamentary speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, conceded defeat after early results pointed to a Khatami landslide and pledged to work with the president-elect.</p>
<p>Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose position commands more authority than the presidency, congratulated Khatami and called on the other candidates and their supporters to back the new president.</p>
<p>Khatami will take over in August from President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who must step down after completing the maximum two four-year terms permitted by law.</p>
<p>The result was a major shock to the religious establishment which has ruled Iran since fundamentalist clerics toppled the pro-American Shah in 1979.</p>
<p>Nateq-Nouri had been a strong pre-election favourite to win but received just 25 percent of the vote while the two other entrants were far behind with relatively small numbers of votes. Some 33 million people aged 15 and over were eligible to vote.</p>
<p>Both leading candidates are 54-year-old middle-ranking Shi'ite Moslem clerics. But while Khatami is an outspoken proponent of reforms, Nateq-Nouri is a traditionalist close to influential groups of conservative clerics and merchants.</p>
<p>Khatami attracted a broad coalition of centrists close to Rafsanjani, Islamist left-wingers and women, intellectuals and youths seeking a more relaxed application of Islamic mores.</p>
<p>The coalition was formed to counter conservatives accused by Khatami's backers of trying to monopolise state power by adding the presidency to their control of parliament.</p>
<p>In Washington, a State Department official said the United States would closely watch the aftermath of the election to see if there were real changes in Iran's behaviour.</p>
<p>Khatami is known to have a more open-minded approach to the West than many conservatives, but analysts did not expect any change in Iran's foreign policy, which is Khamenei's domain.</p>
<p>The United States accuses Iran of sponsoring terrorism and seeking to develop nuclear arms. Tehran denies the charges and says Washington is bent on destroying its Islamic government.</p>
<p>Khatami, an ayatollah's son, is considered an open-minded religious intellectual and tolerant politician.</p>
<p>He advocates more personal freedom, democracy and the rule of law in a country of 60 million where many complain that state bodies act arbitrarily and rules are changed according to the whim of officials.</p>
<p>He also appeals to devout Shi'ites because he holds the title Seyyed and wears a black turban -- signs that he is believed to be a descendant of Islam's Prophet Mohammad.</p>
<p>The result was a blow to Khamenei, who tacitly supported Nateq-Nouri.</p>
<p>Supporters of Khatami were jubilant after he clinched his shock victory with some shopowners handing out boxes of sweet cakes to friends and customers. But celebrations were muted as many Iranians observed a Shi'ite mourning month.</p>
<p>"I'm shocked. I really thought it would go to a second round...The winner is freedom," said Behrooz, a 45-year-old housing agent, relaxing with friends.</p>
<p>"I am very happy. It was very important that Nateq-Nouri did not become president. For the first time the people have rejected what the establishment wanted," said Mitra, a 20-year- old woman student in a main Tehran shopping street.</p>
<p>Iranian police stepped up their profile on key Tehran highways and intersections early as daylight ended. Special units stopped cars to enforce strict Islamic dress codes while regular police and plainclothes security stood by.</p>
<p>One woman driver wearing the compulsory hejab (headscarf) was rebuked by a female officer outside her car for wearing make-up which is not officially tolerated.</p>
<p>At least one other young woman was put into a white coach with red windows by the patrol. The patrol usually detains violators of dress codes overnight.</p>
