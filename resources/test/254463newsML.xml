<p>A do-it-yourself brush-on liquid condom has gone on sale in South Africa, its makers said on Friday.</p>
<p>The "liquidom" consists of a bottle of luridly coloured liquid latex and a 12 mm applicator brush used to paint it directly onto the erect penis.</p>
<p>"It airdries to a form-fitting sheath that matches your contours perfectly," according to the label on the bottle.</p>
<p>Roger Atkins, head of Condomania South Africa which bought the worldwide rights from its inventor, Austrian body-painter Karl Machhamer, said that it had worked perfectly well as a contraceptive barrier during extensive trials.</p>
<p>But the liquidom is sold as a novelty and carries a warning that, with so much up to the user's brushwork, it does not provide proven protection against pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p>Atkins said it all depended how carefully the latex was applied, using what was basically the same process as industrial manufacturing of condoms, which dips a mould into liquid latex.</p>
<p>"It is simple to apply. It is brightly coloured and you'll easily be able to see if you covered the whole area," he told Reuters. "If you want a thick condom, just do a second coat."</p>
<p>It takes some five to seven minutes to apply a liquidom and let it dry properly, but Atkins said that anyone too impatient to wait could safely use a hairdrier to speed the process up.</p>
<p>You roll it off later, just like a normal condom.</p>
<p>The liquidom is sold in Rocket Red, Lunar Yellow and four other colours. Luminous tints will be added in the New Year when it will also go on sale in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
