<p>Cuba's Central Bank is maintaining its growth targets for 1997 at four to five percent, said Francisco Soberon, Cuban Central Bank president, on Wednesday. </p>
<p>The Cuban central cank chief, who has been visiting a number of countries in Europe with ties to Cuba, also told Reuters in an interview the Central Bank's main goal in 1997 was to reduce its short-term debt exposure and added growth would come from manufacturing, services and tourist industries.</p>
<p>In addition, Soberon said a new Central Bank would be completely separate from commercial banking activities and would be in place by the end of 1997. </p>
<p>Soberon said he could not comment on exact figures for first quarter growth, but he was sticking with previous targets.</p>
<p>"We maintain our estimates of four to five percent this year. We could say that we are complying with our main goal this year which is to reduce our short-term exposure," Soberon said, noting the short-term exposure includes debt and credits.</p>
<p>"We feel we have the infrastructure, the skilled labour and organisation to be able to continue with a very steady rate of growth. But we have sacrificed growth in order to reduce our short-term exposure...and that means a healthier growth," he added. </p>
<p>Soberon said to keep the economic recovery going and to finance the economy, the central bank was mainly depending on short-term credits. He also said it wanted to reduce short-term debt because it created tension in management of the economy.</p>
<p>He declined to specify what exact internal debt totals were but said they would be cut by year-end.</p>
<p>"What I can tell you is that we are reducing it. At the end of the year, we will have short-term debt less than we started in 1997. That I can tell you definitely," he said.</p>
<p>Soberon said external debt, which included Paris Club debt, totalled about $10.4 billion and had not risen in 1996. </p>
<p>Soberon said Cuba's sugar crop, which accounts for one-third of the country's economy, would be less than last year but he said growth would come from the manufacturing and tourist industries as well as the services sector. "Growth is supported by all the economy except for the sugar which will be slightly less. Sugar is important and we have to work on it to try to grow again but for now our economy is much more diversified," Soberon said.</p>
<p>In addition, he said the central bank's operations would be totally separate from commerical banking activities.</p>
<p>"There will be a new Cuban Central bank," Soberon said, adding that the bank would be in place by the end of 1997.</p>
