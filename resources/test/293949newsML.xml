<p>Cracks in Austria's feuding government coalition widened on Wednesday in a row over how to privatise the country's second biggest bank, exposing deep divisions between the chancellor and his foreign minister.</p>
<p>The sale of Creditanstalt-Bankverein has led to a split between the Social Democrats of Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and the conservative People's Party led by Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel.</p>
<p>The deepening conflict prompted both party chiefs to agree to convene an emergency session of coalition leaders on Monday -- the first time the committee will have met since a snap general election in December 1995.</p>
<p>That election was called after the same coalition collapsed after failing to agree cuts in a huge budget deficit to prepare Austria for Europe's planned economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>Vranitzky, opening a Social Democrat conference in the southern spa town of Bad Tatzmannsdorf, made clear that his party would not be pushed around over the privatisation.</p>
<p>He said the choice of a bidder for the bank was the sole decision of Finance Minister Viktor Klima, a Social Democrat.</p>
<p>"I stress again, it is Klima's decision...We are not going to be bullied into a decision," the chancellor said.</p>
<p>A final deadline set by Klima for improved offers for the flagship bank expires on Friday. But the conservatives have cautioned him against making a decision until a special parliamentary session next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Vranitzky's stand bodes ill for relations with his junior coalition partner. Senior members of both parties have warned that the survival of the one-year-old government could be jeopardised unless a compromise is reached.</p>
<p>Klima, in an interview in Thursday's edition of current affairs magazine News, said he hoped the conservatives would not force a collapse of the coalition.</p>
<p>"That would mean fresh elections and the only one to profit from it would be Haider," he told News.</p>
<p>Far-right leader Joerg Haider, whose party won nearly 28 percent of votes in a European election last October -- just a few thousand votes behind the two main parties -- has declined to back either governing party in the privatisation debacle.</p>
<p>Since democracy returned to Austria at the end of World War Two, control of key institutions has largely been shared out between the two parties -- there are even two motoring organisations, one backed by each party.</p>
<p>But with the advent of real foreign competition in particular following membership of the European Union two years ago, the system of patronage is beginning to crumble, and with it, the consensus politics that glued the two parties together.</p>
<p>The sale of Creditanstalt, Europe's longest privatisation as it enters its seventh year, has laid bare a battle by each leading party to protect its own power base.</p>
<p>Creditanstalt, one-time bankers to the former imperial Habsburg dynasty, has long been considered the preserve of the People's Party. The real trouble in the coalition began when Bank Austria, considered to be effectively controlled by the Social Democrats, made public its bid to take over Creditanstalt just before a first deadline on December 16.</p>
<p>The People's Party, who favour a bid by an international consortium led by Italian-controlled insurer EA-Generali, considered the move as a bid by the centre-left to consolidate its hegemony over Austria's bloated banking industry.</p>
