<p>Peter Lew, chief of the Witchery Fashion group and son of retailing baron Solomon Lew, has bought over nine percent of listed fashion retailer Country Road Ltd, it was revealed on Friday.  </p>
<p>Confirming his Australian Retail Investments Pty Ltd (ARI) was behind the enlarged stake, Peter Lew played down speculation he was poised to make a takeover bid for the Country Road chain.</p>
<p>"Recent media speculation concerning an imminent takeover bid by interests associated with him is incorrect," Lew said.</p>
<p>But Lew, managing director of ARI as well as the Witchery apparel chain, said in a statement that ARI would view "with interest" Country Road's upcoming half-year result and "also assess the quality ofd the information released".</p>
<p>"Of particular interest will be information concerning the company's current trading performance," Lew said.  </p>
<p>Country Road shares closed at A$1.65 on Friday, down five cents on Thursday's close.</p>
