<p>The House ethics committee said on Thursday it will hold public hearings next week on the punishment to be meted out to re-elected Speaker Newt Gingrich for admitted ethics violations.</p>
<p>The committee announced its schedule for the final phase of its two-year Gingrich investigation in the early morning following some 13 hours of negotiations.</p>
<p>The hearings will lay out in detail and in public for the first time the charges that Gingrich, acting in a way that did not reflect creditably on the House, failed to get legal advice to ensure compliance with a ban on using tax-exempt funds for partisan political activity and gave false information to investigators.</p>
<p>There is wide speculation that the committee will recommend to the full House that Gingrich be given a reprimand -- a penalty less than expulsion or censure.</p>
<p>The committee said in a statement that it anticipated completing its deliberations by Friday, Jan. 17 and in any event would make its punishment recommendation no later than Jan. 19.</p>
<p>Under a rule adopted on Wednesday shortly after Gingrich was re-elected speaker, the ethics committee goes out of business after Jan. 21, so the House must act on any penalty before then. Its final report is to go to the House by Feb. 4.</p>
<p>The hearings start on Monday -- after a closed-door meeting of the committee Sunday -- with statements by lawyer James Cole, the outside counsel who has led the Gingrich investigation, and by Gingrich's lawyer.</p>
<p>The two presentations are apparently expected to be lengthy as the committee has scheduled a 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (1400 GMT to 2300 GMT) session. Gingrich is not scheduled to appear.</p>
<p>Committee members are expected to watch for testimony to support or contradict Gingrich's assertion that he had not intended to mislead when in his name "inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable statements" were given to the committee concerning the relationship between a college course he taught and his former political action committee, GOPAC.</p>
<p>At hearings starting at 9 a.m. (1400 GMT) on the following four days, committee members will be able to make their own statements and question the two lawyers.</p>
<p>Cole and Gingrich's counsel will each make recommendations on what punishment should be imposed.</p>
<p>The committee could go into closed session to evaluate progress and determine whether additional information or documents are needed, according to the committee schedule.</p>
<p>The ethics charges against Gingrich caused nine members of his party to desert him in Tuesday's election in which he retained the speaker's post on a vote of 216 to 205 for House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt. Four Republicans voted for others and five abstained.</p>
<p>Four defectors, Representatives John Hostettler of Indiana, Frank Wolf of Virginia, Scott Klug of Wisconsin and Michael Forbes of New York, were told they were not welcome at a dinner on Wednesday honouring Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour, the Washington Post reported in Thursday editions.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't characterise it as punishment for their votes -- but it is certainly a byproduct of their votes," the paper quoted Republican National Committee Communications Director Edward Gillespie as saying.</p>
<p>Gingrich is the first Republican speaker to win re-election in 68 years. If the House voted to reprimand him, he would be the first sitting speaker to be punished for ethics violations.</p>
