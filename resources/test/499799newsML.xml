<p>With North Korea expected to agree next week to enter landmark peace talks, the United States on Thursday declared its intention not to undermine the regime in Pyongyang, even though it is Stalinist.</p>
<p>"The primary U.S. security concern is instability on the Korean peninsula and we want to prevent the outbreak of war between North Korea and South Korea," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters.</p>
<p>"There's no argument here for letting North Korea implode because that would result in unknown instability, in refugee problems and severe distress for the population of North and South (Korea)," he said.</p>
<p>"One cannot imagine what all the contingencies or developments would result (from such a scenario) ... We want to do what we can to preserve stability, political and military stability," he added.</p>
<p>Toward that end, the United States is expected to announce next week new food aid for North Korea, which has faced an increasingly dire situation because of food shortages caused by two years of flooding.</p>
<p>"As for food aid, we are now working with several agencies of our government to develop our response to the WFP (World Food Program) food appeal. I would expect by next week we would have an answer," Burns said.</p>
<p>A U.S. congressman, Tony Hall, just back from North Korea said on Tuesday he saw soldiers whose uniforms hung off their bodies, showing that even the Communist nation's military was not immune from the "hell of severe famine."</p>
<p>Burns said North Korea has promised to give its long-awaited response next week to a U.S.-South Korea proposal for peace talks.</p>
<p>Delegations from all three countries -- the United States, North Korea and arch-rival South Korea -- are to meet in New York on April 16 and the United States expected the North Korean response would be positive, officials said.</p>
<p>"This is not a briefing. This is a meeting. They (North Koreans) have requested the meeting," Burns told reporters.</p>
<p>The United States and South Korea proposed four-party talks on April 19, 1996 as a way to defuse tensions on the Korean peninsula and get to a peace treaty that would finally close the books on the 1950-53 war that divided the peninsula. China would also take part in the negotiations.</p>
<p>The American delegation, headed by Acting Assistant Secretary of State Charles Kartman, will meet with the delegation of U.S. ally South Korea on Tuesday to coordinate strategy. Then the North Koreans will meet both those parties on Wednesday and possibly on Friday, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>At some point, the United States and North Korea will hold bilateral talks focusing on American servicemen missing in action from the Korean War, U.S. concerns about North Korean missile sales and establishment of liaison offices in each other's capitals, Burns said.</p>
<p>Pyongyang's decision to give a formal response to the peace talks proposal came at a time of heightened international concern about food shortages in the isolated, Stalinist-ruled country and of greater willingness by the United States and other countries to give humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>The World Food Program has called for $95.5 million for 200,000 tons of food and U.S. officials -- noting a positive U.S. response to all previous appeals -- have virtually assured that more U.S. aid will be forthcoming.</p>
<p>Washington has provided $18.4 million since late 1995, including a $10 million donation now being shipped to Pyongyang.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reported on Thursday that the Pentagon's intelligence agency has estimated that as many as 100,000 North Koreans may die from starvation and related diseases in the next four months.</p>
<p>A State Department official said it was clear there was a "serious urgent problem" in North Korea but he was unaware of the Defense Intelligence Agency estimates.</p>
