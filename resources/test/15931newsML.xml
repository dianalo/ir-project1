<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Georgia-Pacific Corp cut.</headline>
<text>
<p>-- J.P. Morgan analyst Mark W. Connelly said he cut his rating on Georgia-Pacific Corp to market perform from buy, reflecting his less optimistic outlook for the wood sector as 1997 approaches.</p>
<p>-- "While the white paper upturn that first attracted us to the stock may finally come later this year, the delay has raised a real risk that other businesses, particularly plywood, will begin to unravel, mitigating that good news," Conelly said in a research note.</p>
<p>-- Shares fell 1-1/8 to 76-3/4.</p>
