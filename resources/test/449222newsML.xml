<p>English giants Arsenal signed Austria under-21 goalkeeper Alexander Manninger from Casino Graz on Tuesday for an undisclosed fee.</p>
<p>Manninger will become the first Austrian to join an English premier league side when he leaves Graz at the end of this season.</p>
<p>"We signed him this afternoon and he'll be joining us in the summer," an Arsenal spokeswoman said. She declined to give details of the fee involved or the length of contract.</p>
<p>Austrian news agency APA said the 19-year-old had agreed to a six-year deal and Graz manager Peter Svetits said: "All I can say is that it is the largest sum ever paid for an Austrian player."</p>
<p>"We just have to agree on a few minor details of the contract," he said.</p>
<p>Graz are reported to have wanted around  $1.0 million for Manninger, who was under contract with them until 2001.</p>
<p>He signed for Arsenal after impressing manager Arsene Wenger in a two-day trial at Highbury this week.</p>
<p>Arsenal's first-choice goalkeeper David Seaman is recovering from a knee operation and his deputy John Lukic is sidelined with a poisoned toe.</p>
<p>Both men could be nearing the end of their careers. Seaman is 33 and Lukic is 35.</p>
<p>Manninger became Graz's number one goalkeeper last October after a brilliant performance in the San Siro stadium in his first European match -- a UEFA Cup tie against Italy's Internazionale.</p>
