<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton's knee-wrenching stumble at the Florida home of golf pro Greg Norman is having a far-ranging impact, affecting everything from diplomacy to the food-loving Clinton's diet.</p>
<p>Clinton has asked Vice Gore to fill in for him Monday at traditional St. Patrick's Day events, including a ceremonial meeting with Irish Prime Minister John Bruton and a White House party in honour of Ireland's patron saint.</p>
<p>"The Vice President will preside at that (party). He'll try to keep the noise level down so we don't disturb our patient upstairs," White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.</p>
<p>Even before Clinton left the hospital on Sunday after a 48-hour stay due to knee surgery, the White House announced that he and Russian President Boris Yeltsin would start their Helsinki summit Thursday, one day later than planned.</p>
<p>McCurry said this would give Clinton, whose only scheduled event on Monday was a pre-summit meeting with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, an extra day "to get used to how to be mobile."</p>
<p>"There's a lot of learning that will go into adjusting to the president's somewhat less than normal status right now ... He'll have to get more familiar, more accustomed to using crutches," the White House spokesman said.</p>
<p>A Clinton visit to Denmark that was to have followed the summit is being postponed until July, he said.</p>
<p>But these are all merely minor adjustments. The changes that will really mean a difference for the active 50-year-old president relate to his personal lifestyle.</p>
<p>Doctors say that as he recuperates from surgery to repair a torn tendon in his right knee, Clinton is going to have to slow down. "I told him privately ... this is going to be the hardest thing," Dr. Connie Mariano, the president's personal physician, told reporters.</p>
<p>Clinton also faces weeks of painful physical therapy to restore flexibility to his damaged joint. But changing his diet to keep from putting on weight may be the most painful thing of all for this president who loves to eat -- and then run it off.</p>
<p>"You take a healthy runner who runs routinely and you break their legs, they gain, what, 27 pounds in one year. And we do not want that to happen, and he does not want that to happen. So we're really going to look closely at what he eats," Mariano said</p>
<p>"I will be the enforcer in the White House," she joked.</p>
<p>Clinton's doctors said they would also suggest that he substitute swimming for jogging and golfing, and teasingly added that an indoor White House pool might be reclaimed and put to use.</p>
<p>The pool was covered during Richard Nixon's presidency in order to create workspace for the White House press corps.</p>
<p>"Just kidding, we won't do that," McCurry said. The White House also boasts an heated outdoor swimming pool just a few steps from the president's Oval Office.</p>
