<p>Hong Kong's richest man, real estate tycoon Lee Shau Kee, has offered to finance construction of a C$600 million traffic tunnel under Vancouver's inner harbor, local newspapers reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lee, chairman of Henderson Land Development Co Ltd, has real estate holdings in Vancouver and approached the local park board about financing the tunnel which would run under the city's famed Stanley Park, the Vancouver Sun and Province newspapers said.</p>
<p>Lee was estimated by Forbes magazine to be worth US$12.7 billion, ranking him at fourth richest man in the world. Henderson currently has several residential real estate projects around Vancouver.</p>
<p>Henderson's local affiliate, Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd, declined comment on the reports. The papers said the provincial government would contribute about C$200 million to the project with Lee putting up the rest. He would then recover his investment through tolls for use of the tunnel.</p>
<p>British Columbia and the City of Vancouver are currently studying alternatives to ease congestion on the traffic-clogged Lions Gate bridge which spans the Burrard Inlet. The province has said it was leaning towards a proposal that would widen the existing bridge at a cost of only C$135 million.</p>
<p>But that option has drawn criticism because it would alter the graceful lines of the 58-year-old heritage bridge and funnel more traffic through Stanley Park, a green oasis in the middle of the city that is a popular tourist attraction.</p>
<p>The city's park board has urged the construction of a tunnel because it would remove cars from the park. The roadway approaching the bridge runs through the park.</p>
<p>The provincial government said Tuesday it was interested in hearing more about the new financing offer. It is expected to decide which option to pursue within the next few weeks.</p>
