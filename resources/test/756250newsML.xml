<p>The single European currency, due to be launched on January 1, 1999, is an odds-on bet, according to a series of exclusive Reuters polls. But it was not always so.</p>
<p>Two years ago, those who fancied a flutter may have thought twice before putting their money on European economic and monetary union (EMU) starting on time.</p>
<p>Turbulence on the foreign exchange markets, fears that the Maastricht criteria would never be met and an under-estimation of the political will behind the project meant that many experts doubted EMU would fly.</p>
<p>But the tide of opinion had already turned when Reuters began to canvass economists and think-tanks on a regular basis last October.</p>
<p>Since then, forecasters across Europe have predicted an average likelihood of a timely EMU of no less than 76 percent.</p>
<p>"There were a lot of Anglo-Saxon economists saying it was never going to happen...but on the Continent there was more of a focus on stable exchange rates and a strong political desire to move towards EMU," said Steven Englander, vice-president and international economist at Smith Barney in Paris.</p>
<p>QUALITY OR QUANTITY?</p>
<p>While the experts quoted in Reuters polls have been believers in the concept of a single currency, opinions on which countries will be members have swung back and forth.</p>
<p>In the first survey, just the six countries of Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands were expected to form the launch pad, with all respondents sure of their inclusion.</p>
<p>Ireland and Finland, dubbed the "nearly men" of Europe, have always skirted the edges of this group, with the backing of more than 80 percent of experts.</p>
<p>Until May, the over-riding view from the polls was that EMU would go ahead with membership confined to countries north of the Alps. In October, fewer than one in 10 respondents thought Spain, Portugal and Italy would make the grade.</p>
<p>This would have been welcomed by the German public, who, fretting over the loss of their beloved mark, were reluctant to open the door to southern European countries because they feared a weaker euro currency would result.</p>
<p>But the chances of France meeting the budget deficit-to-gross domestic product (GDP) target of three percent in 1997 look slim since the new government has promised no fresh austerity measures.</p>
<p>And Germany is still forecast to overshoot the target despite assertions from finance ministers that Bonn will continue its tough savings drive.</p>
<p>These economic hitches have widened the membership goalposts.</p>
<p>"Germany and France have internal economic problems which are very serious. They will have to struggle hard to meet the criteria, but it's not such a big deal as the political will is still there," said Heidi Sherman, senior economist at the Munich-based Ifo Institute.</p>
<p>In the latest monthly EMU poll published on July 15, the Iberian bloc soared up the ranks with more than 80 percent of respondents backing their timely entry.</p>
<p>Italy's chances of joining at the start also rose with more than half the respondents thinking it would now be part of the first wave.</p>
<p>"The 'Club Med' countries look pretty good as far as the criteria go, therefore it is more and more difficult to exclude the Italians," Sherman said.</p>
<p>"It's a political decision. It always has been," she added. "Economists would say 'Go with a small group then expand', but politics won't permit that."</p>
<p>HEAVYWEIGHTS GIVE EXPERTS THE MOST HEADACHES</p>
<p>Since the polls began, the lowest average prediction for EMU getting off the ground has been 76 percent in March and June this year.</p>
<p>Doubts in March over Germany and France's ability to meet the criteria reduced EMU's average chance of starting on time. In June, Germany's failed attempt to use its gold reserves to boost government coffers and the surprise election of Lionel Jospin's Socialist party in France added new twists to the tale.</p>
<p>"France and Germany are certainly in much weaker positions...and that has increased the chances of a wider EMU," said Brian Venables, senior bond strategist at ABN AMRO in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>According to Reuters' quarterly poll on how each country is shaping up to meet the Maastricht criteria, economists have always had lingering doubts over whether Germany and France would hit the three percent deficit-to-GDP ratio.</p>
<p>They also predicted that Germany would fail to bring its national debt down to 60 percent of GDP as stipulated in the rules for entry to the euro.</p>
<p>Germany's determination to stick to the letter of the law in the Maastricht treaty, combined with the failure of Europe's two economic powerhouses to meet some of the basic requirements, left the EMU timetable on shaky ground.</p>
<p>"The Germans held a harsher, stronger view -- that the criteria had to be adhered to very closely, even though that wasn't the straightforward reading of the treaty text," said Smith Barney's Englander.</p>
<p>"INS" AND "OUTS"</p>
<p>But recent signals from German officials and central bankers show that Bonn may be easing off on a strict interpretation of the criteria, which means that 1999 could see an EMU membership of as many as 11 countries --- the core six, Ireland and Finland, Italy and the Iberian countries.</p>
<p>As some countries have improved their chances of joining in the first wave, others have slipped down the ranks.</p>
<p>Denmark, originally seen as a founder member by a quarter of those surveyed, is now deemed to have a chance of just four percent. Sweden has seen its support dwindle from 14 percent to two percent, while Greece and Britain have never managed to break into double figures.</p>
