<p>The biggest Dutch bank, ABN AMRO NV, on Thursday posted a 26 percent rise in 1996 net profit, but cited market uncertainty for declining to give a forecast for the current year.</p>
<p>Total net profit rose to 3.30 billion guilders ($1.7 billion) from a previous 2.62 billion guilders, giving net per share of 9.26 guilders versus 7.69 guilders.</p>
<p>The bank increased the dividend to 4.20 guilders per share from 3.60 guilders previously.</p>
<p>The results were bang in line with analysts' forecasts and in Amsterdam ABN AMRO shares shed 3.20 guilders each to 139.20 in a generally weaker market.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO said it was optimistic on its outlook, but it was too early to make a forecast for current year results.</p>
<p>"The managing board looks forward to the future development of the bank with confidence.</p>
<p>"In the light of the uncertainties surrounding the financial markets, the board finds it too early to make a profit forecast for 1997," it said in a statement.</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean we would expect a decrease in profits. It's simply not possible to give any statement about the future," chairman Jan Kalff told reporters.</p>
<p>ABN, the largest foreign bank in the United States, also said it planned to list its shares in American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>As part of that arrangement, the bank will buy back one percent of its own shares which it will re-offer to U.S. investors. The bank also announced plans for a four-for-one share split.</p>
<p>ABN said it had put-aside special provisions of 340 million guilders last year as it geared up for the advent of both a single European currency in 1999 and the millennium.</p>
<p>It said it would use this money for adapting computer software for introducing the euro and changing computer programme dates after 2000.</p>
<p>It repeated an earlier forecast that total costs associated with these two projects would be more than 500 million guilders.</p>
<p>Analysts welcomed the results.</p>
<p>Harry Luchtenveld at Generale Bank said: "The bottom line was in line with our estimates. The share split should help the share price and it supports our long-term buy recommendation."</p>
<p>"Investors usually like share splits even though they don't get anything more out of it...The ADR listing in the U.S. is also good for the stock," said Tom Muller at NIBStrating, adding that the dividend hike would boost market confidence.</p>
<p>"The worst thing I can say about ABN AMRO is that it is excellent," he said.</p>
<p>"Over the next 18 months I expect it to be involved in some big acquisitions in European financial markets..."</p>
