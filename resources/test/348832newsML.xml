<text>
<p>A South Korean court said on Friday it had decided to protect the debt-ridden Hanbo Steel Co and its affiliate Hanbo Corp from creditors.</p>
<p>An official at Seoul District Court said the decision was made to limit adverse effects on the economy from the failure of the companies.  </p>
<p>The court said all assets of the two companies would be frozen until the court rules on their applications for court receivership.</p>
<p>Hanbo Steel filed for receivership on Tuesday after piling up about five trillion won of loans from 61 banks and finanical institutions.</p>
<p>Government officials said Hanbo's trouble stemmed from excessive investment in building a steel mill in the southern city of Tanjin.</p>
