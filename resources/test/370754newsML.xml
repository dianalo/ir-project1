<p>German machine tool-maker Traub AG said on Tuesday bankruptcy proceedings had been initiated, as it had previously indicated was likely following the failure of efforts to scale back debt with creditors.</p>
<p>Traub said in a statement that takeover offers would be considered from Gildemeister AG and Index, two firms that have expressed an interest in the business.</p>
<p>Shares in Traub were earlier suspended by the Stuttgart stock exchange, a move that the Frankfurt bourse said also applied to its market.</p>
