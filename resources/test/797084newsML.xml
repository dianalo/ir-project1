<p>A human rights group accused Israeli paramilitary border police on Wednesday of almost routinely beating Palestinians, 10 months after a TV video shown worldwide caught two of the security men in the act.</p>
<p>The Israeli rights group B'Tselem issued a 31-page report detailing what it said were 15 cases of "beatings, degradation and serious abuse" of Palestinians by security forces over the last three months, at least 12 involving border policemen.</p>
<p>A Jerusalem magistrates court is due to sentence on Thursday the two policemen pictured by an amateur cameraman on videotape last October assaulting six Palestinians caught in Jerusalem without work permits.</p>
<p>The videotape, showing the two policemen kicking some of the Palestinians in the head and kneeing another in the stomach, was broadcast around the world.</p>
<p>"In spite of the condemnations of Israeli officials following past incidents and the pledges to eradicate the phenomenon, nothing has been done to change the behaviour of the security forces," the B'Tselem report said.</p>
<p>"Beatings, abuse and degradation of Palestinians by Israeli security force personnel remain a frequent, almost routine occurrence," it said, demanding that authorities must finally end what it called a policy of violence against Palestinians.</p>
<p>Palestinians frequently complain of abuse by the border police who patrol Israeli cities and the West Bank.</p>
<p>Israel's Channel One television broadcast what it said was another case of border police brutality involving two Palestinian labourers. It said the two were so badly beaten on Tuesday that they required hospital treatment.</p>
<p>It interviewed Palestinian cousins Ahmed Moussa, 19, and Mahmoud Ghneim, 27, the married father of a baby girl, as they lay side by side in a hospital in the West Bank town of Beit Jala.</p>
<p>It said they were beaten after entering Israel without permits in the face of a closure imposed on the West Bank after a July 30 suicide bombing in Israel. It said three border policemen beat them in an isolated wood.</p>
<p>"Each one of them carried a club and administered beatings. One of them asked if my chest was all right and hit me in the chest. There were three who hit me," said Moussa, breathing heavily through a hospital mask.</p>
<p>"One of them pointed an M-16 rifle at my head -- he pointed the rifle next to my ear and told me: 'If you don't get out of here now, now you'll get out of here. If I see you again, I will kill you. You must die'."</p>
<p>Ghneim, showing his bloodied right side to the camera, said the border policemen tied his leg to a jeep and dragged him along the ground for 150 to 200 metres (yards).</p>
<p>The television said Ghneim managed to make his way to a main street where Israelis picked him up in their car and took him to hospital for treatment. Israel's Justice Ministry was investigating the incident.</p>
<p>Channel One quoted a spokesman for the border police as saying steps would be taken against those responsible, should the claims of the two Palestinian workers prove to be true.</p>
