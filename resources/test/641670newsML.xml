<p>Naphtha prices were stable to a tad firmer in afternoon Tokyo trading, but most market players kept to the sidelines in a market devoid of clear direction, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Basically, buyers and sellers are trying to find out where the other side is," one naphtha dealer said.</p>
<p>Ongoing term naphtha talks between Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) and Asian buyers were seen nearing an agreement.</p>
<p>ADNOC is expected to soon notify buyers of its counteroffer to bidding prices that were submitted late last week and earlier this week, traders said.  </p>
<p>ADNOC is likely to stick to its original offer price of $22.50 per tonne over the ADNOC formula for term contracts starting in July, and is expected to give buyers little choice but to either "take it" or "leave it," some traders said.</p>
<p>Bidding levels were said to be around $19 to $20 over the ADNOC formula, compared to the current premium of $6.80.</p>
<p>In fuel oil trading, a South Korean refiner said it is still looking for a low sulphur waxy residue cargo for second-half June lifting.</p>
<p>Open-spec naphtha was assessed at $206.00/207.50 for first-half August, compared to Wednesday's $206.25/206.75.</p>
