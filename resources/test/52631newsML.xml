<p>Argentina's Economy Minister Roque Fernandez presented Congress Friday with a blueprint for the 1997 budget including a forecast for five percent economic growth.</p>
<p>The draft presented to the lower house's Budget Committee also sees real investment rising 10 percent and a total budget deficit of $3.0 billion, equivalent to 1.0 percent of the country's gross domestic product.  </p>
<p>The draft said the government expected to close the fiscal gap in the short term and have a balanced budget in 1998.</p>
<p>The project includes an expected 4.3 percent rise in consumption. Exports are expected to rise by 7.0 percent and imports by 9.6 percent.</p>
<p>Total public expenditure is seen at $43.0 billion and total revenue at $41.0 billion. That would represent a $1.96 billion gap, but after the expected deficit of the province's pension funds transferred to the central government is added, the total budget deficit would be $3.0 billion.  </p>
<p>The foreign trade forecast includes an expected $27.53 billion in exports and $29.43 billion in imports -- a $1.9 billion deficit. This compares with an expected surplus of $800 million this year.</p>
<p>Combined consumer and wholesale inflation is estimated at 2.0 percent.</p>
<p>The 1997 forecast also contemplates maintaining the peso-dollar parity introduced by Fernandez's predecessor Domingo Cavallo in 1991.</p>
<p>The draft will now be discussed at committee level before going to the floor. It must be approved before year's end.</p>
