<p>-- McDonald &amp; Co analyst Christopher Caton said Tuesday he began coverage of Chad Therapeutics Inc with a buy rating and a 12- to 18-month price target of $21 a share.</p>
<p>-- Chad makes and markets a broad line of oxygen conservation devices that increase the efficiency of standard oxygen delivery systems used to treat patients with respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>-- "(Chad's) products provide an average of seven-to-one savings over standard delivery systems and are just as clinically effective as continuous supply devices," Caton said in a report.</p>
<p>-- He added that demand for Chad's products is expected to continue to grow rapidly.</p>
<p>-- Chad shares were up 1/8 at 17-5/8 early Tuesday afternoon.</p>
