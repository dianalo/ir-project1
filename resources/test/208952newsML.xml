<p>Pen pictures of players expected to comprise the Feyenoord squad for Sunday's Dutch first division match against Ajax Amsterdam:</p>
<p>Ed de Goey. Goalkeeper. Age 29. Unspectacular but reliable. Won 27 Dutch caps before being displaced by Ajax keeper Edwin van der Sar.</p>
<p>Clemens Zwijnenberg. Right-back. Age 26. Stand-in for suspended George Boateng. Stocky but fast and has yet to command a regular first-team slot. Has been linked with a possible move to Utrecht.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Claeys. Central defender. Age 22. Has won two caps for Belgium. Bought in the summer to replace Ronald Koeman who is due to retire at the end of the season. Has so far failed to convince that he is ready for that task.</p>
<p>George Boateng. defender. Age 21. Of Ghanaian origin but playing in the Dutch international youth team. Strong and fast defender. Proven marker. Has been linked with Spanish side Valencia. Just finished a four-match ban after being sent off during an away match at PSV Eindhoven for kicking an opponent.</p>
<p>Ronald Koeman. Libero. Age 33. The Feyenoord skipper's passing skills and free-kick prowess are well known. His reading of the game and organisation of fellow defenders make up for a consummate lack of pace. Won 78 caps for the Dutch national team and plans to retire at the end of this season.</p>
<p>Bernard Schuiteman. Defender. Age 23. Expected to replace suspended left-back Patricio Graff. Began his career with German first division side Bayer Leverkuesen.</p>
<p>Kees van Wonderen. Midfielder. Age 27. Joined Feyenoord in the summer from NAC Breda and has become a valuable midfield asset. Scored twice on his European debut in a UEFA Cup first round tie against CSKA Moscow.</p>
<p>Pablo Sanchez. Striker. Age 23. Argentinian striker who was another close-season buy. Beginning to settle in the Dutch league but still mixes brilliance with mediocrity.</p>
<p>Giovanni van Bronckhorst. Midfield. Age 21. Has caught the attention of national coach Guus Hiddink, winning two caps this season. Multi-functional left-sided player.</p>
<p>Gaston Taument. Right winger. Age 26. Speed and trickery on the right flank have given many opponents a hard time and won him 16 international caps.</p>
<p>Henryk Larsson. Striker. Age 25. Regular up front for Sweden, the blonde-dreadlocked striker is the Rotterdam club's top scorer with five league goals. His modest height belies danger in the air. Excellent timing.</p>
<p>Henk Vos. Striker. Age 28. Robust forward who has a lack of finesse but who is a proven goal-scorer. Suspect temperament.</p>
<p>Marek Saganowski. Striker. Age 18. On the fringes of the Polish national team. Another close season buy with an eye to the future. Used sparingly so far as substitute.</p>
<p>Henk Fraser. Central defender. Age 30. Hard man at the heart of the defence.</p>
<p>Tomek Iwan. Midfielder. Age 24. Joined from Roda JC at the beginning of last season in a complex transfer deal that required legal mediation. Has yet to command a regular first-team place.</p>
