<p>Scotland are seeking urgent talks with English officials after being informed on Sunday that four Newcastle players may not be released for international rugby duty next weekend.</p>
<p>Doddie Weir, Gary Armstrong, Peter Walton and George Graham are involved in either Scotland's Murrayfield test against Australia or the A team clash with the Junior Springboks, but Newcastle also have an important league game scheduled.</p>
<p>Former England fly-half Rob Andrew, now Newcastle's director of rugby, issued a statement insisting the English club had reached "crisis point" regarding the availability of their Scottish and Irish players.</p>
<p>Scotland team manager Arthur Hastie is hoping a swift solution will be found with the help of the Rugby Football Union and, if necessary, the International Rugby Board (IRB).</p>
<p>"As far as I am aware, the International Board ruling says national teams have first call on players. I hope if there were to be any difficulties, the IRB would do something.</p>
<p>"England brought out a ruling that three England players had to be involved before a club could get dispensation to reschedule a league match. The league regulations do not mention anything about Scottish players."</p>
