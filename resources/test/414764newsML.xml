<p>Net exports of refined oil products from the Middle East will rise nearly 40 percent by the year 2000 because of new and upgraded refinery plants and slower regional oil demand growth, an analyst said on Monday.</p>
<p>The increase in product exports to 2.20 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2000 would be mainly in gas oil (diesel) and jet-kerosene and also gasoline, David Isaak, research director at Seattle Research and Training Center (SRTC) told delegates at the fifth annual Middle East Petroleum and Gas Conference.</p>
<p>"Exports from the Mideast seem set to increase substantially ...the export slate shows solid increases in the top and the middle of the barrel," Isaak said in a conference paper.</p>
<p>Exports are projected to hit 2.39 million bpd in 2005, according to SRTC which based its forecast on likely future downstream developments in Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen.</p>
<p>Industry analysts estimate that Middle East refiners are currently pumping around 1.6 million bpd of refined products to world markets, mainly to Asia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Refinery capacity in Asia, particularly in South Korea, is also rapidly increasing to take advantage of expected increases in Asian and Far East middle distillate and gasoline demand.</p>
<p>"New (refining) capacity is never welcomed by those that are already in the market. The increase in Mideast exports may be bad news for many," Isaak said.</p>
<p>Mideast diesel exports would reach 622,000 bpd in the year 2000 and 698,000 bpd in 2005 from 411,000 bpd in 1995 while jet-kerosene flows would reach 426,000 bpd at the end of the decade and 542,000 bpd in 2005 from just 257,000 bpd in 1995, Isaak's conference paper showed.</p>
<p>Gasoline exports run to 238,000 bpd in 2000 from 94,000 bpd.</p>
<p>Part removal of state price subsidies on petroleum products in the last two years, mainly in Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the increasing domestic substitution of oil products by gas was slowing domestic growth rates and freeing up export barrels.</p>
<p>"Increases in prices and other policies to restrain domestic demand for oil...have lowered the growth trajectory dramatically. The cuts in demand growth are sharpest for middle distillates where demand on the world market is strongest," said Isaak, noting Saudi demand fell in 1995 when prices were lifted.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia and Iran account for 70 percent of oil demand in the region and 78 percent of kerosene and diesel.</p>
<p>A 50 percent increase in cracking capacity by 2000 -- particularly hydrocracking and middle distillate desulfurisation (HDS) upgrading -- would lift exports of lighter products.</p>
<p>Most of this upgrading work was being carried out at Saudi Arabia's Rabigh and Ras Tanura refineries and the new Iranian Bandar Abbas plant which is due on stream this year.</p>
<p>UAE and Kuwaiti supplies would also increase.</p>
<p>At the end of the decade Mideast hydrocracking capacity would reach 583,000 bpd from a present 373,000 bpd, cat-reforming capacity to 643,000 bpd from 455,000 bpd and HDS capacity to 720,000 bpd from 594,000 bpd, according to SRTC.</p>
