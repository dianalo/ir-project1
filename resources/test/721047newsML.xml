<p>Vietnam's rice market was stable this week, with export shipments continuing apace, but new deals were thin on the ground as the winter-spring crop petered out.</p>
<p>"The previous crop has finished and the new one is still ahead," a trader said. "So trade is slowing down and we have not seen much change in the price of rice."</p>
<p>Five percent broken grade was quoted at $259-260 per tonne, FOB Saigon Port, up slightly from $255 a week ago. Ten percent broken was unchanged at $245-250 a tonne.</p>
<p>Loading in Saigon Port has hampered recently by heavy rains. Dealers said there were about 15 vessels loading that would head for Iraq -- which has agreed to take 150,000 tonnes under a government-to-government deal -- and Iran and African countries.</p>
<p>One trader said he expected prices to rise in the next few weeks because unseasonably dry weather in the Mekong delta, the country's rice bowl, could delay some of the summer-autumn crop.</p>
<p>He reckoned that the drought had damaged tens of thousands of hectares of the summer-autumn crop, and replanting could delay the harvest, which normally starts at the end of July, in those areas by about a month.</p>
<p>Vietnam expects to export 3.5-4.0 million tonne of rice this year. The official Finance and Market Daily said on Thursday that 1.9 million tonnes were sold abroad in the first six months of the year, 50 percent more than in the same period of last year.</p>
