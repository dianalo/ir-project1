<p>A British brewer was so sure Manchester United was going to win the European Cup football semi-final it spent a stack of money splashing congratulatory ads across newspapers -- then had to pull the ads at the last minute when the team lost.</p>
<p>Britain's Press Association said on Thursday that Boddington was so confident the English Premier League football club would win the European Cup semi-final on Wednesday it spent 40,000 pounds ($64,900) placing advertisements in Thursday newspapers.</p>
<p>After United lost the semi-final 1-0 to Germany's Borussia Dortmund, Boddington was forced to place hurried late-night phone calls to withdraw the adverts before they appeared in Thursday newspapers, the Press Association said.</p>
<p>The ads featured a pint of Boddington's beer, known as the "cream of Manchester", with a Dortmund pennant and the slogan "Creamed". Boddington is owned by Whitbread Plc.</p>
<p>"Having witnessed the excellent progress United have made all season, we were sure the cream of English football would rise to the top in Europe," Stuart MacFarlane, Boddingtons brand manager, told the Press Association.</p>
<p>MacFarlane was not immediately available for comment.</p>
