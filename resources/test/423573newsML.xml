<p>State oil firm NNPC has started looking for a new partner for its National Engineering and Technical Company (NETCO) after U.S. multinational Bechtel pulled out, NETCO chief executive Alex Ogedengbe said.</p>
<p>He told reporters in Lagos on Wednesday that NNPC was screening a number of foreign engineering services companies for the purpose of entering into new joint venture arrangements.</p>
<p>NETCO was formed in 1989 as a joint venture between NNPC and Bechtel to execute engineering contracts in the oil and allied sectors.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm terminated the arrangement on December 23, 1996 for reasons which have not been made public by either side.</p>
<p>"We are coping quite well since Bechtel left," Ogedengbe said.</p>
<p>Ogedengbe said the joint venture arrangement being considered would be on a project-by-project basis.</p>
<p>He said the numerous contracts being executed by NETCO would not be affected by Bechtel's pull-out.</p>
<p>These include rehabilitation of oil depots, design of pipelines, upgrading of oil jetties and construction of a floating and production storage facility.</p>
<p>"We have had five to six years working experience with them and our own engineers have been able to acquire sufficiently the technical knowhow and some commercial framework to go it alone," Ogedengbe said.</p>
<p>The Nigerian government said last year that contracts in the petroleum sector, the country's economic backbone, should be awarded only to firms registered in Nigeria and NETCO is one of the companies favoured because it is considered Nigerian.</p>
