<p>Diversified concern Metro Pacific Corp (MPC) said on Thursday its board agreed to raise its stake in affiliate Smart Communications Inc to strike a balance between its real estate and telecommunication portfolios.</p>
<p>"The higher level of ownership in Smart will raise significantly MPC's investment in telecommunications; thereby providing a better balance in MPC's investment portfolio in terms of risks, recurring income and cash flow, and growth prospects," a Metro Pacific statement said.  </p>
<p>Metro Pacific is the lead developer of the 214-hectare Bonifacio property being built at the edge of the financial district of Makati.</p>
<p>"The agreement to increase MPC's investment in Smart will represent a significant transaction, and is a key development for the MPC Group in terms of its planned strategy of diversification," president Napoleon Nazareno said.</p>
<p>Metro Pacific director Seumas Gallacher said the company would issue new shares in exchange for Smart shares held by Metro Pacific's parent First Pacific Co Ltd.</p>
<p>"No cash will change hands," Gallacher told Reuters.</p>
<p>First Pacific said Metro Pacific would have a majority economic interest in Smart following the deal, up from 28 percent at present.</p>
<p>The other major investor of Smart, the Phillippines' largest celular phone provider, is Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT).</p>
<p>The share swap is expected to be finalised before Smart's initial public offering (IPO) which is tentatively scheduled in the third quarter of the year.  </p>
<p>After the swap, Hong-Kong based First Pacific's stake in Smart will be significatly reduced to allow more foreign fund managers to participate in the IPO.</p>
<p>A Philippine law allows foreigners to own up to 40 percent of a telecom company.</p>
<p>NTT was assured its 15 percent stake would not be diluted in the process.</p>
<p>First Pacific said its holding in Metro Pacific would be determined based on the share prices of Smart and Metro at the time of the IPO.</p>
<p>Aside from property and telecom, Metro Pacific is also involved in consumer products, packaging and banking.</p>
