<p>ASIAN FOREX ACTIVITY:</p>
<p>0025 GMT</p>
<p>*Dollar rose against mark in morning Tokyo as bearish mark sentiment continued amid uncertainty over EMU and political row between German government and Bundesbank on possible revaluation of gold reserves.</p>
<p>*Dollar eased slightly after earlier rising on expectations of commercial buying at 0100 GMT.</p>
<p>*Mark/yen weak, but supported near 67 yen for now.</p>
<p>*Dollar/yen lacks market-moving factors, exaggerating mark sales in morning trade.  </p>
<p>*"The mark is supported near 67 yen for now with short-covering interest," a city bank dealer said. But he added that mark sales would continue amid mark bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>*A trust bank dealer said stop-loss sales may emerge if mark clearly falls below 67 yen.</p>
<p>*Despite market expectation of exporters' offers above 116.50 yen, the city bank dealer said their offers are only seen above 117 yen.</p>
<p>*The trust bank dealer said there is talk of public funds placing offers on upside but buying back on downside.  </p>
<p>0010 GMT</p>
<p>*Dollar hovered in narrow range against mark and yen in early Tokyo trade on Wednesday, little changed from late Tuesday levels in New York.</p>
<p>*Dollar expected to pivot around 116 yen, capped by exporter offers above 116.50 yen and supported by bids around 115.50 yen, dealers said.</p>
<p>*Dollar/yen activity taking cues from dollar/mark and mark/yen, a trust bank trader said. Dealers said dollar's upside versus mark seen heavy due to profit-taking interest.</p>
