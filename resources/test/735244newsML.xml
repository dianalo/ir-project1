<p>A jump in crude futures values and a tight European physical scene helped push up naphtha front-month swap values by $1-$1.50 as physical deals were reported done in NWE and the Med several dollars above quotes of a day earlier.</p>
<p>A London-based trader said he had sold a Greek cargo to a Med end-user at $190 for August 5-10 loading, and that he had purchased an open spec cargo in the north at $191 for July 25/August 5, reportedly from a north American products trader.</p>
<p>Brokers said the deals were likely to lift published highs, which stood at $185 for the north, by as much as $4-$5 after Wednesday's $7 jump.</p>
<p>One physical broker said the deals had come against the backdrop of a tight physical scene in which traders were buying up volumes in the north, although end-users were running for cover at current values.</p>
<p>The prospect of large-scale arb flows from the Med to both Asia and the US Gulf during July and August was also seen keeping that market short.</p>
<p>By late afternoon, August swap values were placed by dealers in the $190.50-$191.00 range as September backwardation widened to around $3.00 and October was seen $1.50-$2 behind September.</p>
