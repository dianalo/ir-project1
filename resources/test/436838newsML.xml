<headline>Portuguese shares end down due weaker dlr, Wall St.</headline>
<text>
<p>1750 GMT - Portuguese shares closed lower, mirroring foreign markets as Wall Street was hit by profit-taking at the opening after its second record close in a row. Stocks that are most exposed to foreign investors such as Portugal Telecom, Portucel Industrial, Banco Comercial Portugues and Sonae Investimentos closed lower. Dealers said that the trend tomorrow will depend on foreign bourses and the dollar.</p>
<p>* PSI20 down 0.35 percent to 6,227.88</p>
<p>* Dealers said the drop of PT at the close was due to profit taking and the slide of foreign bourses. "It could have been profit taking (in PT shares) after the strong rise of the stock recently, because I don't think the explanation lies merely in the fall of other stock exchanges, especially when you consider that PT's 1996 results were at the top end of expectations," said one dealer.</p>
<p>* Dealers noted strong interest in retailer Jeronimo Martins,  which rose 30 escudos to 9,180 in volume of 99,301 shares.</p>
