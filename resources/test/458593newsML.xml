<p>Toronto stocks ended mixed in brisk dealings on Friday, amid nervousness over a possible U.S. interest rate hike and quarterly triple-witching.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index rose 19.50 points to close at 6074.78 on turnover of 101.5 million shares worth C$1.9 billion ($1.38 billion).</p>
<p>But the overall market was mixed with declining issues outnumbering advances 491 to 447, while 331 stocks were unchanged.</p>
<p>Volatility earlier in the session was due partly to the quarterly expiry of options, futures and options on futures called triple-witching, traders said.</p>
<p>Investors are also nervously awaiting a possible rise in U.S. interest rates following the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We have the anticipation of (U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan) Greenspan doing what he said he was going to do," said Montreal-based strategist Bill Ram.</p>
<p>The TSE, Canada's largest stock market, lost 87 points this week from last Friday's close.</p>
<p>Of Toronto's 14 sub-indices, 10 moved higher led by banks, oils, forestry products and conglomerates. The weak side included gold and base metals.</p>
<p>Among hot stocks, gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. sank 2.25 to close at 15.20 on over nine million shares, the TSE's heaviest trader.</p>
<p>The selloff was sparked by an Indonesian newspaper report which cast doubts on the size of the Busang gold deposit which Bre-X discovered in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Bre-X partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. declined to comment on the Busang deposit until it has completed its due diligence process.</p>
<p>Sofware maker Cognos Inc. jumped 4.10 to close at 33.10 after UBS Securities upgraded it to a strong buy from a hold. The brokerage also raised its earnings estimates for the company.</p>
<p>Investors continued to scoop up shares of Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd. in the wake of its C$2 billion ($1.45 billion) friendly takeover bid for Wascana Energy Inc. Canadian Occidental rose 0.95 to finish at 26.90, while Wascana traded steady at 20.65.</p>
