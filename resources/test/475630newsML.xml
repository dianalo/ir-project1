<p>More than five years (corrects from "six years") after the collapse of the Soviet Union Russians are still gloomy about the future, with two-thirds of them believing their country is going in the wrong direction, according to an opinion poll published on Sunday.</p>
<p>The All-Union Centre for Public Research polling group (VTsIOM) also found that Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov would win most support if a presidential election were held immediately.</p>
<p>The VTsIOM poll, published by the weekly Interfax-Argumenty i Fakty newspaper, showed 68 percent of respondents believed events were going the wrong way or heading towards a dead end.</p>
<p>Only 14 percent believed events were taking Russia in the right direction. Eighteen percent were undecided.</p>
<p>They were asked: "What do you think -- are things in Russia going in the right direction or do you think events are not taking us that way, are leading us towards a dead end?"</p>
<p>The poll of 1,630 people was carried out from March 14 to 19. It did not include the latest government appointments made by President Boris Yeltsin to inject new life into economic reforms under a gradual reshuffle.</p>
<p>Opinion polls are not widely trusted in Russia. But many Russians are disillusioned with a backlog in wages and pensions and with reforms which some of them say have made life more difficult than in Soviet times.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people took part in demonstrations against the government's economic policies last Thursday but the nationwide day of protests attracted fewer people than trade unions had expected.</p>
<p>VTsIOM also asked who Russians would vote for if a presidential election were held immediately and Yeltsin did not run. Under the constititution he cannot he cannot seek a third term.</p>
<p>Zyuganov won 18 percent support and tough-talking Alexander Lebed, Yeltsin's ousted security adviser and now a critic of his policies, was second with 15 percent backing.</p>
<p>Liberal leader Grigory Yavlinsky trailed far behind in third place with the support of six percent of respondents.</p>
