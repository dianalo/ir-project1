<p>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co Inc said Thursday it had filed papers with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court seeking approval to exit its "non-core" specialty retail store business -- Lechmere, Home Image by Lechmere and Electric Avenue &amp; More.</p>
<p>Lechmere, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Montgomery Ward, was acquired by Montgomery Ward in 1994. The specialty retailer of appliances, electronic equipment and products for the home, operates 33 stores throughout New England as well as in New York, Michigan, Wisconsin and Alabama.</p>
<p>Montgomery Ward introduced the Electric Avenue &amp; More specialty stores in 1994. There are currently eleven of these appliance, electronics and furniture stores located in the Midwest, Kentucky and South Carolina.  </p>
<p>"The decision to close these stores and the resultant job losses has been a difficult one," said Roger Goddu, chairman and chief executive officer of Montgomery Ward.</p>
<p>"However, we believe this is an important first step as we formulate our plan of reorganization.  We are convinced that by shedding these non-core specialty formats, the company will be able to focus its energies on our full-line Montgomery Ward stores," he said in a news release.</p>
<p>The proposed restructuring would affect about 3,200 Lechmere associates, and about 700 associates employed by Electric Avenue &amp; More. Montgomery Ward said it will try to offer reassignment in other Montgomery Ward stores to as many associates as possible. Those who are not offered or do not accept reassignment will be offered severance and outplacement assistance.  </p>
<p>"Our near term strategy for store closings is to shed ancillary specialty store formats in order to gain the efficiencies inherent with focusing on only full-line Wards stores. It reduces the complexity in our business by reducing the number of strategies from four to one," he said.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, these closings will have a significant impact on cutting losses," he added.</p>
<p>Montgomery Ward will concentrate on its core business and begin to implement a new merchandise strategy. The strategy emphasizes providing affordable apparel including footwear, accessories and fine jewelry, and home-related products that include domestics, furniture, appliances and home entertainment.</p>
<p>Montgomery Ward, the largest privately held retailer in the United States, currently operates 400 value-driven stores in 43 states.  After the proposed store closings, the Company will have 356 stores in 39 states.</p>
<p>The retailer filed for bankruptcy on July 7, 1997. ((Chicago newsdesk 312 408 8787))</p>
