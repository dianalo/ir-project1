<headline>Clinton nominees face tough questioning in hearings.</headline>

<p>Senate confirmation hearings on the latest batch of Cabinet nominees announced on Friday by President Bill Clinton will give Republicans an opportunity to air pet grievances and ask tough questions.</p>
<p>The hearings are scheduled to get under way early next year.</p>
<p>Bill Richardson, a Democratic congressman from New Mexico picked as United Nations ambassador, is certain to undergo a grilling on U.S. policy toward the world body when he appears before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
<p>The committee is headed by conservative. Sen Jesse Helms, R-North Carolina, who has long been a U.N. critic.</p>
<p>Helms spokesman Marc Thiessen said confirmation would not be a "rubber stamp process" and the committee expected Richardson and the administration to "lay out a very detailed proposal for U.N. reform."</p>
<p>William Daley, picked as secretary of commerce, will be challenged to assert control over a department under fire for alleged connections with political fundraising.</p>
<p>Charlene Barshefsky, named as U.S. Trade Representative, could face a problem over her representation of the Canadian lumber industry while she was a Washington lawyer.</p>
<p>Under a 1995 law, anyone who previously represented a foreign government in a trade dispute with the United States is barred from the Trade Representative's post.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe, from the timber state of Maine, said in a statement: "Given the large number of trade disputes that both Maine and the United States have with Canada, and given her background as an attorney retained by the Canadian federal and provincial governments, I think her nomination will have to be carefully scrutinised."</p>
<p>Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott said Daley would take the reins at a Commerce Department "taken off course by the unchecked activities of deputies and lower level apppointees not previously held accountable to the secretary."</p>
<p>A former Commerce official was at the centre of questionable fund-raising activities by the Democratic National Committee during the presidential election campaign.</p>
<p>Lott said Daley would have to "remove domestic and international political fundraising from the job descriptions of Commerce's employees and cooperate with the Congress in the investigations of allegations that the Commerce Department solicited illegal foreign political contributions."</p>
<p>Lott said Richardson would need all his skill and energy to face challenges at the United Nations because U.S. credibility at the world body has plummeted.</p>
<p>He said the Clinton administration had failed to pursue serious reform and address congressional concerns about the U.N., and that international support for airtight sanctions against Iraq had collapsed.</p>
