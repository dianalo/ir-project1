<p>Greek stocks settled 1.33 percent higher on Wednesday, with insurance and industrial shares leading and analysts saying the bourse would consolidate this week.</p>
<p>"Turnover grew on Wednesday, as buying interest became stronger. There were positive news in the press with regard to the profitability of banks, especially big state-owned ones," said investment analyst John Haveles, at Delphi Mutual Funds.</p>
<p>Investors are also awaiting financial results and forecasts from the industrial sector as well, he added. He expected the market to consolidate this week, with a resistance level at 1,450-60 points.</p>
<p>Following a better-than-expected March CPI inflation figure -- 6.0 percent -- banks started a new round of interest rate cuts last week. The focus now is on April CPI which is expected to dip below 6.0 percent.</p>
<p>An informal Reuters poll of bankers and economists produced a mean forecast of 5.7 percent. Forecasts ranged from 5.5 - 6.0 percent.</p>
<p>The Athens general share index ended 1.33 percent or 18.53 points higher at 1,413.42 from Tuesday's 1,394.89 close, after opening at 1,400.87.</p>
<p>Turnover rose to 15.0 billion drachmas on volume of 4.4 million shares. Advancers led decliners 136 to 77 with 23 issues unchanged on 236 traded.</p>
<p>Banks firmed 1.31 percent and construction gained 0.03 percent. Industrials rose 2.01 percent and insurance climbed 2.21 percent.</p>
