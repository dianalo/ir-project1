<p>The U.S. developer of a proposed $243 million resort at Vietnam's fabled China Beach said Monday he was unwilling to put more money into the joint venture project without assurances from Vietnamese officials.</p>
<p>China Beach, near Danang, was a rest and recreation area for U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War and became the subject of a network television series, "China Beach." The resort is one of the biggest foreign investment projects licensed in Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Planning and Investment said last week it would consider withdrawing the license because the BBI Investment Group had failed to make an initial deposit of $2 million by an-end-of-November deadline.</p>
<p>Robert Bernstein, president of BBI Investment Group of Chevy Chase, Md., said the firm wrote to Vietnam's Ministry of Planning and Investment on Nov. 30 asking how it intended to meet certain criteria BBI had outlined.</p>
<p>"Until our concerns are addressed and met and resolved satisfactorily ... we are not willing to invest any more money in this project," Bernstein said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>"Too much money has been invested -- no results," he said. He declined to specify the criteria for continued financing.</p>
<p>Physical work has not begun on the project, which includes renovation of an existing beachfront hotel, a new hotel, golf course and related facilities.</p>
<p>Under the venture agreement signed in September 1994, BBI holds a 67 percent interest in the venture. The rest is held by the Non Nuoc Tourist Co., set up by the People's Committee of Quang Nam-Danang province.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Planning and Investment said last week BBI had to pay the $2 million deposit, secure a loan for the whole project and submit a new plan for its implementation by or face the possibility of a licence withdrawal.</p>
<p>Bernstein said BBI had spent more $2 million directly on the project but had not channeled the money through the joint venture account because of bureaucratic difficulties.</p>
<p>He said BBI had sold its interest in the project to an unidentified firm in November, but the buyer pulled out after talking with the Vietnamese venture partners.</p>
<p>The daily Vietnam News on Nov. 30 quoted a senior Vietnamese official involved in the project as saying that at least three other foreign investors were willing to step in if BBI failed to meet its deadline.</p>
<p>"If BBI ... fails to meet the deadline all its hard work in surveys and feasibility studies over the last three years would become a windfall for others to pick up," the official said.</p>
<p>It said those interested included a venture between Japanese, Canadian and Italian interests called Transiting Commerce Technology, Asia Invest of France and an American firm which is already building a tourist complex just south of the planned BBI resort. It did not name the U.S. company.</p>
