<p>Tele-Communications Inc has reinstated VH-1, the music video channel, to its Denver viewers part time and will allow systems nationwide the option of reinstating it, a TCI spokesman said.</p>
<p>"It's back on in Denver as of Thursday," said Mike Smith. He said other cable systems are also expected to reinstate the channel.</p>
<p>VH-1 is owned by Viacom Inc.</p>
<p>TCI had said earlier it would review the decision to drop the channel. VH-1 had taken out full page ads in Denver newspapers to protest the decision.  </p>
<p>TCI had received about 400 calls from disappointed VH-1 viewers who wanted the channel back on.</p>
<p>In Denver, VH-1 will share its channel space with a pay-per-view channel, Smith said.</p>
<p>VH-1's ability to pressure TCI reflects the growing problem that cable operators face. TCI spokesman Bob Thomson said that programming costs are the "most rapidly growing" that TCI faces.</p>
<p>VH-1, which had planned a press conference in Denver to encourage viewers to call TCI, had no immediate comment on the reinstatement.</p>
