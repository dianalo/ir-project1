<p>TALX Corp said Tuesday Sears, Roebuck and Co will become the 100th corporation to use its new service that helps employees obtain home loans and other forms of credit faster.</p>
<p>TALX said the service, called The Work Number for Everyone, provides automated telephone access to a nationwide database of employee records. The service is faster than traditional processing methods, which rely on manual requests from banks and other lenders to verify an applicant's employment status and salary, TALX said.</p>
<p>TALX provides human resources software services.</p>
<p>Its shares added 1/4 Tuesday to close at 9-3/8.</p>
