<p>Supporters of Indonesia's minority Moslem party rioted in East Java because they were angry their party may not receive any seats in the local parliament, residents said on Saturday.</p>
<p>They said a number of shops owned by ethnic Chinese, a car dealership and some government buildings were damaged when the angry crowd, said to be supporters of the Moslem-oriented United Development Party (PPP), marched through the town of Jember after Friday prayers.</p>
<p>"They were angry with the possibility that Golkar may receive all the seats in the local parliament," one resident told Reuters by telephone from Jember, 800 km (500 miles) east of Jakarta.</p>
<p>The ruling Golkar party recorded a landslide victory with more than 74 percent of the national vote at last month's general election which was plagued by violent clashes, particularly on the main island of Java, between supporters of PPP and Golkar.</p>
<p>The formal allotment of seats has yet to be made.</p>
<p>Residents and church sources said they had heard up to five rioters and one security force member had been killed in the Friday incident.</p>
<p>They said it took police and troops about five hours to take control.</p>
<p>Jember military commander Lt Col Djasmin Senos was quoted in Media Indonesia daily newspaper as saying that eight people had been injured but denied there were any deaths.</p>
<p>Police in Jember told Reuters on Saturday that the situation was calm and they had no reports of deaths or serious injuries after the attacks.</p>
<p>Doctors at Jember's main general hospital said they had not treated anyone after the riot. Two other hospitals in the area also said they had no riot-related injuries.</p>
<p>Residents said troops and at least four police armoured cars from the provincial capital of Surabaya were patrolling the city.</p>
