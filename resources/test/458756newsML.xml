<p>Serbian bankers urged the government on Friday to start repaying the so-called old hard currency savings to citizens, frozen since the early 1990s, to improve confidence and restart saving deposits to banks.</p>
<p>The state owes to Yugoslavs around 6.5 billion German marks in frozen hard currency savings and the issue was raised at a bankers' meeting here. Half of the sum is owed to those whose savings do not exceed 5,000 German marks.</p>
<p>While economists caution the money has been spent a long time ago, bankers insist the debt must be repayed.</p>
<p>"If not, Yugoslavs will never ever again save with domestic banks," one banker said.</p>
<p>A survey by the Institute for Market Research conducted earlier this year showed Yugoslavs saved on average only 11.2 dinars in 1996.</p>
<p>But analysts said resolving the hard currency savings issue was a tough problem for any government to tackle, let alone that of cash-strapped Serbia.</p>
<p>"This is no longer an economic or political, but an ethical issue to be resolved only by a law which will regulate repayment of the debt," Jubanka general manager Marko Steljic told the bankers' meeting.</p>
<p>Another banker said the law would have to specify terms and sources of funds for repaying the debt.</p>
<p>Vitomir Janjuz of Kreditna Banka Beograd (KBB) said the state would make the best move if it split debt servicing into several stages.</p>
<p>First, the state should use privatisation receipts from the sale of the most lucrative industries to start repaying the debt. Later on, it should select more state property for sale and service the debt to those whose savings exceed 5,000 marks, Janjuz said.</p>
<p>"It would be suicidal for this state to make plans for paying back the entire debt. Instead, it should think of paying back 3-4 billion marks and make sure the first repayment stage goes on smoothly.</p>
<p>"By that time, everybody will see that there are funds, that money is paid back and I am confident that Yugoslavs will begin saving again," Janjuz told Reuters.</p>
<p>While waiting for the state to create the law, Steljic suggested the government could use 0.2 dinars from 3.75 dinars for each litre of petrol sold and direct money to a special purpose fund.</p>
<p>This would generate almost 400 million dinars ($72 million) and could help the poorest Yugoslavs who in some cases lost their life-long savings.</p>
<p>"In any case, we must push for a solution. If not, banks not paying back must be shut down," Steljic said.</p>
<p>The problem of hard currency savings becomes even more intricate with the central bank refusing to pay to commercial banks the money they already paid to the citizens.</p>
<p>By law, banks are obliged to pay small amounts of the dinar cash equivalent for very few purposes, including medical treatment and education abroad or funeral costs.</p>
<p>But the law also says the central bank will compensate commercial banks the cash they delivered to their customers.</p>
<p>In practice, the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY) has not always lived up to the law with its main restraint seen in depleted forex reserves, unofficially estimated between $230 million and $270 million.</p>
<p>Banks claim the NBY owes them millions of dollars in serviced hard currency savings, but the NBY has often excused itself insisting the state must resolve the problem. -- Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
