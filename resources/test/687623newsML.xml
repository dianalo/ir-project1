<p>Australian bond yields stabilised just below Tuesday's levels after the market was once again driven by developments in offshore markets will little to focus on locally until next week's Reserve Bank board meeting.</p>
<p>An early rally was all but wiped out after the second quarter Japanese Tankan survey proved much stronger than expectations and raised the prospect of tighter Japanese policy and an erosion in yields diiferentials to Australia.</p>
<p>Stephen Roberts, chief economist at UBS Australia, said the data would probably bring forward expectations of a Japanese rate hike, but would not have any implications for local policy.  </p>
<p>"Still you would only have one percent Japanese interest rates at the short-end of the curve and perhaps 5.0 percent sometime in July here, but the important point is that there is other preferences for Japanese who may be looking to invest offshore," Roberts added.</p>
<p>Japanese interest rates currently stand at 0.5 percent and there are strong expectations that the RBA will cut 5.5 percent official rates next week. But while there is a considerable gap between the two, investors could be looking to higher yielders such as the U.K., New Zealand, and even the U.S., which while at parity with Australia now, could tighten in the future.  </p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee meets on July 1 and 2, a consideration that the RBA will be taking into account when it meets on July 1. However, some analysts believe that current local economic fundamentals are such that the RBA will still ease even if the Fed tightens.</p>
<p>An easing has been more or less priced in, but with the market in a void regarding domestic indicators, trading remains light and largely dependent on the moves in U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>U.S. debt weakened in Tokyo after the U.S. dollar dropped on the Tankan report, which showed the key big manufacturers' diffussion index at plus seven when a small fall was expected.  </p>

<p>The local market gave up some of its initial spread tightening to the U.S. and Canada after the Tankan report and continued to lag New Zealand debt. The N.Z. market is taking a positive approach to this Thursday's budget and was further boosted by a Eurokiwi issue on Tuesday.  </p>
