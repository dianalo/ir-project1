<p>World benchmark North Sea Brent crude oil advanced 12 cents from its earlier settlement of $18.16 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in London, traders said Friday.</p>
<p>The same Wall Street player that appears to have been on a paper buying spree in the last few days picked up another two full paper cargoes on Friday at $18.28 a barrel. Both sellers were European -- one a major, the other a state oil company.</p>
<p>Also, one August/September spread trade was heard done at minus 14 cents in otherwise light pre-weekend trade in the after-market window.</p>
