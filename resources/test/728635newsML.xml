<p>Poland's current account deficit will be too large to be financed by capital inflows next year and unless urgent action is taken the zloty faces the same fate as the Czech crown and the Thai baht, HSBC James Capel said.</p>
<p>"The Polish miracle is now in danger of being marred by an uncontrolled escalation of the trade deficit," the European Sector Report dated July 9 said.</p>
<p>It said looser fiscal and monetary policy over the last several years, including an unnecessary 100 basis point interest rate cut by the central bank in July 1996, contributed to the boom in domestic demand and credit expansion.</p>
<p>"We see the only permanent solution to the trade problem being a slowdown in domestic demand, which will require a combination of a sharp contraction in the budget deficit and further monetary measures to restrict consumer credit growth."</p>
<p>The report also said the zloty was overvalued by 17 percent against the dollar and 23 percent against the mark and that in the medium term the authorities would need to switch to a more flexible system.</p>
<p>It said that at the end of June the zloty was at 3.286 to the dollar, while its implied fair value rate was 3.973 zlotys.</p>
<p>HSBC said the zloty was at 1.886 to the mark, while it's fair value was at 2.459 per mark.</p>
<p>Since that time the zloty has tumbled to about 3.51 to the dollar and 1.96 to the mark, amid speculative currency sales and foreign investor withdrawal from Polish paper.</p>
