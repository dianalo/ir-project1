<p>European Union energy ministers will attempt on Tuesday to narrow their differences over partial liberalisation of the EU gas market, with a view to reaching a definitive accord by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The Dutch, which hold the EU presidency, hopes to broker a compromise at a meeting in Brussels on three major obstacles to liberalisation -- the structure of market opening, the treatment of take-or-pay contracts and exemptions from competition rules for emerging markets and regions.</p>
<p>A spokesman for EU Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutsis said last Friday the Commissioner hoped for an accord on principles on Tuesday but did not expect a firm deal on figures until after the forthcoming French and Irish elections, perhaps in July when Luxembourg takes over the EU presidency.</p>
<p>The Dutch will propose to ministers a two-level formula for progressively liberalising national gas markets.</p>
<p>The formula asks member states to agree on a general definition of "eligible customers", who will be allowed to negotiate contracts directly with the gas supplies.</p>
<p>As well as all power generators, the list should include large industrial customers who consume several million cubic metres of gas a year, though the figure has yet to be agreed.</p>
<p>As national fuel markets vary considerably -- with gas well- established in places like Britain but only just beginning to develop in Portugal and Greece -- these eligible customers will represent widely different shares of national markets.</p>
<p>So to level the playing field, the Dutch formula also asks ministers to set an obligatory EU-wide minimum threshold for liberalisation and an optional maximum ceiling, and agree to raise them in five years time.</p>
<p>Last December, the member states agreed to liberalise 12 percent of their electricity markets by 1999, rising to 33 percent by 2003.</p>
<p>Britain's new energy minister, John Battle, said on Sunday the new Labour government would continue the pro-liberalisation policy of its Conservative predecessor.</p>
<p>"The new government supports liberalisation of gas markets," Battle said in a statement, adding "Competition brings real benefits for industry and society, and when customers are put first should not be feared."</p>
<p>While EU diplomats are predicting a possible accord next week on the approach to liberalisation, they are less sure of a deal on the long term take-or-pay contracts with suppliers in Russia, Algeria and Norway which dominate the EU's gas industry.</p>
<p>The member states generally agree that if introducing competition into a domestic market causes a crisis for distributors locked into take-or-pay contracts, they should be able temporarily to limit newcomers' market access.</p>
<p>But there are deep divisions over who will be responsible for authorising exemptions from competition, with Commissioner Papoutsis and Britain saying Brussels should decide and Germany and France wanting the decision left with national authorities.</p>
<p>The Dutch have tabled a compromise which allows member states to approve derogations for existing take-or-pay contracts but leaves rulings on future contracts up to the Commission.</p>
<p>But a Dutch diplomat told Reuters she was pessimistic about the chances of a deal this week.</p>
<p>Connected to this issue is the question of exemptions from competition rules for emerging markets.</p>
<p>A British diplomat said there was general consensus that Portugal and Greece should be allowed protection for 10 years but energy ministers still had to agree whether to allow exemptions for isolated regions like Northern Ireland.</p>
