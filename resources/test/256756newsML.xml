<p>An overnight slide on Wall Street slammed Asian markets for a second straight day, with Tokyo falling 2.5 percent early on before rebounding and Hong Kong shares down by more than two percent by late morning.</p>
<p>U.S. blue chips dropped like a stone in the last hour of trading, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 100 points in its biggest point loss since mid-July. It lost 1.54 percent to close at about 6,304.</p>
<p>Asian markets followed the Dow's lead early on, except for Taiwan, which remained in positive territory until late morning.</p>
<p>The sharp drop on Wall Street overnight cast a shadow over Japan shares, which tumbled in choppy trading.</p>
<p>The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares briefly fell more than 500 points, or 2.5 percent, in hectic morning trade to about 19,987. It was the first time the index had been below the key 20,000 level in three months.</p>
<p>The Nikkei then stabilised and at the midday close was down 350.57 points at 20,150.63, a loss of 1.71 percent.</p>
<p>"Due to the New York sell-off, we can't hope for foreign investors' buying in Tokyo. That dampened the Nikkei average," said Harushige Kobayashi, deputy general manager at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell further in late Friday morning trading, mainly on selling from overseas investors cautious about international equity market trends, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index declined 304 points to 12,748 then retreated further to 12,736, down 316 points, shortly before the close of the morning session.</p>
<p>"It's a bit unsettling what is happening overseas," said Archie Hart, sales director at BZW Securities. "But Hong Kong has been quite resilient compared to other markets."</p>
<p>The Australian share market was sharply lower at the midsession on Friday as investors found few reasons to remain in the market after Wall Street's sharp fall. At midday, the All Ordinaries index was 36.1 points down at 2,303.5.</p>
<p>New Zealand share prices largely withstood the steep drops in overseas markets. The NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 12.60 points, or 0.53 percent, down at 2,349.91.</p>
<p>Malaysian stocks fell in early trade in knee-jerk selling due to the Dow's fall. About 0200 GMT, the Composite Index was down 15.85 points, or 1.32 percent, at 1,183.84.</p>
<p>After 45 minutes of trading, the Jakarta Composite Index fell 2.84 points, or 0.45 percent, to 625.06 points.</p>
<p>The Singapore stock market drifted lower in early trade after Wall Street's slide. Dealers said extremely thin volumes limited the downside in Singapore.</p>
<p>At 0215 GMT, the Straits Times Industrials Index was down 12.29 points at 2,170.26 after opening at 2,181.28.</p>
<p>Thai stocks fell 1.50 percent in thin early trade as investors sold large capitalised stocks on Wall Street's cue. The SET index dipped 13.05 points to 859.20 only 22 minutes after the market opened.</p>
<p>Seoul stocks closed morning trading lower as investors still unsure of the market's prospects increased selling, brokers said. The composite index lost 2.68 points to 686.70, the year's lowest intra-day level, by the lunch break.</p>
<p>Philippine shares were only slightly weaker in early trade. The composite index slipped 8.06 points, or 0.26 percent, to 3,121.05 points after 50 minutes of trade.</p>
<p>For much of the morning, Taiwan share prices had defied the big Wall Street, Tokyo and Hong Kong slides, extending early gains as investors showed a contrary spirit.</p>
<p>With 70 minutes left, the index was up 20.54 points, or 0.30 percent, at 6,846.16. Shares ended mixed at the midday session.</p>
