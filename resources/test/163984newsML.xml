<p>The outlook for most major commodities traded on U.S. and European exchanges remains bearish near term, with weakness likely in the energy and metals sectors and in some tropical products, analysts said.</p>
<p>But the grains sector may be oversold, while the livestock sector looks to have already turned up, they added.</p>
<p>"Precious and base metals, grains, tropicals and cotton all have neutral to negative technical pictures for the near to intermediate term," Merrill Lynch's New York commodities strategist Bill O'Neill said.</p>
<p>"At this point we would project this pattern will continue well into the first half of 1997," he said. "Even the energy sector is showing signs of a possible top and we are downgrading our long running bullish bias to neutral.</p>
<p>The CRB was down 0.43 points at 236.87 midday Monday, after sliding to a new intrday 12 month low at 236.86.</p>
<p>NYFE January CRB futures were down 0.50 points at 235.00, with the popular four, nine and 18 day triple moving average trend-following indicator still in a downtrend since early September. But the contract's standard nine-day relative strength indicator (RSI) closed at 23 pct Friday, near oversold levels.</p>
<p>"The CRB is clearly oversold on a short term basis and a consolidation bounce is possible, but it is viewed as likely to be short lived and a downside bias for the CRB is favored," O'Neill said.</p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) was down 0.38 point at 203.38 midday, though the heavy 49 pct energy-sector weighting in the GSCI, meant that the GSCI was only at a four week low.</p>
<p>The more active CME November GSCI futures contract, with open interest of 10,436 lots Friday, was down 0.50 points midday Monday at 203.40 and the four, nine and 18 day averages suggest this contract has also entered a downtrend for the first time since July.</p>
<p>"There probably is more downside for many commodities," Dean Witter's Chicago analyst Stephen Platt said.</p>
<p>"Energies could certaintly move lower, but the grains slide may be nearly over, while a bounce in precious metals would not surprise either," he said.</p>
<p>Despite the growth in the US economy this year, weakness in Asian economies and sluggishness in European economies, has led to lower grain and metal demand from Asia in particular, analysts said.</p>
<p>With US distillate (diesel and heating oil) inventories recovering from historic lows, relieving fears of a winter shortage of heating oil, and US crude oil inventories consolidating around 300 million barrels, some profit taking is occurring in NYMEX crude oil futures and IPE Brent futures, analysts said.</p>
<p>NYMEX crude futures open interest, at 393,462 lots on October 31, is well off its recent peak at 432,120 lots on October 10.</p>
<p>NYMEX December crude was off just one cent at $23.02 a barrel midday, but the backwardation in the crude oil strip has eased with the nearby/next December/January spread down to 27 cents midday Monday, from 74 cents two months ago, suggesting prompt market tightness may be easing.</p>
<p>The downside could be limited by the winter's impact on refined petroleum product markets, analysts said.</p>
<p>The December 3-2-1 crack spread, a proxy for refining margins and the tightness of product markets, remained not far from its mid-summer highs at $4.41 a barrel at Friday's close.</p>
<p>"Over the past week or so, we've seen heating oil prices weaken vis-a-vis gasoline and the rest of the energy complex owing to a temporary dissipation of concerns about heating fuel supply availability and, to some extent, traders liquidating some of their length in those spreads," Merrill Lynch energy analyst Michael Rothman said in a weekly report.</p>
