<p>A match made in municipal bond heaven was how sources on both sides of the aisle viewed the impending merger of Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co and Morgan Stanley Group Inc.</p>
<p>"Obviously we are merging with a firm with tremendous institutional capacity, and obviously they want access to our retail capacity," a municipal bond source at Dean Witter said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"I'm impressed with the logic of it beyond the fact that it happens to be the firm I work for," the source added.</p>
<p>Any job cuts are likely to be few, he said.</p>
<p>"I don't think that in our narrow area here we have what you'd call a serious duplication of efforts," the Dean Witter source said.</p>
<p>Dean Witter formally exited the municipal institutional business about two years ago, finding it too much of a capital drain, he said. "We found ourselves having to commit for $50 million worth of bonds on something where our true retail demand for it was $15 (million), and that simply didn't make any sense," the source said.</p>
<p>A source at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co concurred that the planned merger appears to make strategic sense.</p>
<p>For 1996, Morgan Stanley ranked ninth as a senior manager, with $5.2 billion of municipal deals.</p>
<p>Though he admittedly had spent little time weighing the combination of the two firms' municipal departments specifically, the mix appears to be a good one, he said.</p>
<p>"I mean they have a tremendous retail distribution, we don't have that. We have the institutional presence, which they don't have," the Morgan Stanley source said. "So it looks like one and one is going to make more than two here."</p>
<p>The Dean Witter source added that merger will likely make Dean Witter's retail component even stronger.</p>
<p>Though the firm still talks to institutions, when Dean Witter formally ended its municipal bond presence there, a number of its better retail account executives jumped to other firms such as PaineWebber Inc. Those account executives rely on heavy municipal supply volume.</p>
<p>Now, the proposed new firm will have the combined advantages of Dean Witter's broad retail base and Morgan Stanley's institutional presence.</p>
<p>"I think this is obviously going to give us better access to some of the big hitters in retail who will suddenly find Witter is the place they want to be," the Dean Witter source said.</p>
<p>Though the new firm has a way to go, it will likely be in "a position as strong as Merrill Lynch's, if not stronger," he said.</p>
<p>The loss of some of its bigger retail account executives did have a bright side for Dean Witter, the source said, adding that their departure forced the firm to broaden it's distribution network.</p>
<p>"We are much better at distributing municipals to accounts that are not huge," he said. "You always learn how to conserve water when it looks like the well is going to run dry, and that's what we have done."</p>
<p>Overall, the Morgan Stanley source called the proposed merger "powerful," and added that the stock market has given its blessing to match.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley's stock was up 7-5/8 points, while Dean Witter's was up 1-3/4.</p>
<p>"The key is can you integrate two firms with different cultures," he said. "And John and Phil are pretty good friends, and I thihk we'll do it."</p>
<p>Philip Purcell, Dean Witter's chairman and chief executive officer, will hold the same title at the new firm, which will be called Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co.</p>
<p>John Mack, Morgan Stanley's president, will serve as president and chief operating officer of the new company. Morgan's chairman, Richard Fisher will be chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. The board will consist of 14 members, seven nominated by each firm.</p>
