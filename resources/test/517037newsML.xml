<p>Hungary's sugarbeet crop is expected to be smaller this year but will still cover domestic demand, industry sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"The planted area will be 101,361 hectares, over 93 percent of which is already sown," Andras Angeli, Chairman of the Sugar Industry Association (SIA), told Reuters.</p>
<p>He added that the planted area was some 15 percent lower than last year's but that it would still more than cover Hungarian sugar demand.</p>
<p>"Last year, the sugar factories contracted some 115,000 hectares because in the spring Slovenia, Yugoslavia and Croatia signalled a need for some 600,000 tonnes of root," he said, adding that those countries eventually only bought 200,000 tonnes of beet equivalent.</p>
<p>"This left Hungary with a 60,000 tonnes sugar surplus and despite some indication for export demand, the industry is much more cautious this year," Angeli said.</p>
<p>He added that from this year's sown area the SIA expects a crop of some 4.1 million tonnes of beet compared with 4.7 million in 1996.</p>
