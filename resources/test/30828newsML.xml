<p>Shares firmed slightly in mid-afternoon trading, but still ended Tuesday in negative territory, brokers said.</p>
<p>New economic policies unveiled in the afternoon by the finance ministry helped lighten the mood slightly, they added. But volume continued to be sparse, indicating that investors were sidelined, waiting for more definite market moving news.</p>
<p>The composite stock index fell 4.46 points to provisionally close at 769.80. Only 16.4 million shares changed hands, against a market average of about 20 million.  </p>
<p>After the end of trading, the finance ministry announced the foreign stock ownership limit would be lifted on October 1 to 20 percent from the current 18 percent. Brokers said that this would give the market a short term boost.</p>
<p>News that the United States had launched missile attacks on Iraq also came at the end of trading. Brokers said that unless the situation was quickly resolved, the market could be pressured since South Korea depends on the Middle East for most of its crude oil imports.</p>
<p>The finance ministry announced on Tuesday afternoon measures to control prices and boost competitiveness.  </p>
<p>Analysts said that the announcement did not contain anything to excite the market, but was seen as generally positive.</p>
<p>"Investors were afraid that the government would come down hard on consumption, but there were no specific measures about that," said Steven Lee, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities.</p>
<p>Ten companies, including Hyundai Electronics and Samsung Engineering, applied to list shares on Tuesday. This could further exacerbate concerns about an oversupply of stocks.</p>
