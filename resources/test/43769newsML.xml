<p>Haicang port in China's eastern Fujian province has signed development deals worth a total of $146 million, the Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 11 deals signed by the port included eight industrial projects with combined investment of $40.8 million, one port development project involving $96.38 million and two real estate projects involving $9.04 million, the agency said.</p>
<p>Of the total investment agreed at a trade fair in the province, $77.75 million would come from overseas, it said but gave no details.</p>
<p>Haicang port is in Fujian's Xiamen city, which has been chosen by Beijing as a future centre for proposed direct trade links with China's rival Taiwan.</p>
<p>Construction of facilities such as telecommunications, electric power, and berths for shipping had begun and work on the Haicang Bridge, Xiamen's largest project this century, would start by the end of this year, Xinhua said.</p>
