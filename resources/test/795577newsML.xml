<p>Applied Materials Inc gained market share from competitors during its recently completed fiscal third quarter, Chief Executive Officer James Morgan said on cable T.V. network CNBC on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Applied Materials makes equipment used to produce semiconductor chips.</p>
<p>"What we are seeing is clear market share gains in every product area," Morgan said.</p>
<p>He said the industry move to smaller and faster microchips, such as those 0.25 micron and below, helped propel earnings. The company saw its largest sales quarter ever in the United States and sales in the Asia Pacific region continued to grow.</p>
<p>Applied Materials will focus on growing internal operations and will use acquisitions selectively, Morgan said.</p>
<p>Applied Materials stock was up 8-7/8 to 99-1/8 by mid-afternoon following its report Tuesday of a profit from operations of $0.77 a share for the third quarter ended July 27 compared with $0.92 a share in the same quarter a year ago.</p>
<p>This was well above financial analysts' expectations that the company would earn $0.68 a share in the quarter, according to First Call.</p>
<p>Other equipment makers include companies like Novellus Systems Inc and Lam Research Corp.</p>
