<p>Mesabi Trust said Tuesday trustees have determined that no distribution will be declared in April with respect to Units of Beneficial Interest of Mesabi Trust.</p>
<p>The continued omission was anticipated, the trust said, explaining only a minimum advance royalty is received by Mesabi Trust for the first calendar quarter of each year as few or no shipments are made in the first calendar quarter by Northshore Mining Co, the lessee/operator of the trust's properties, because the Great Lakes shipping lanes are frozen during the period.</p>
<p>The trust said shipments resumed in early April.</p>
<p>It last paid $0.145 per share on February 20.</p>
<p>With respect to the balance of 1997, the trust said, Northshore has not advised as to its expected 1997 shipments or what percentage of 1997 shipments will be from Mesabi Trust ore.</p>
<p>Northshore has indicated that currently scheduled 1997 pellet production will be about 4.2 million tons, comparable to 1996.  ((-- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610.))</p>
