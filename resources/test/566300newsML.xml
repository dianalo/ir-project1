<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-07</dateline>

<p>*Dlr ends nearly flat but cable falls more than two cents on wire report quoting unnamed senior UK Labour source as saying stg should rejoin ERM in 2001 at 2.50 marks. *Stg/mark falls slightly,analysts see more slippage in Europe despite holiday.</p>
<p>*Dollar/yen hurt on G3 intervention talk. *Tsy's Rubin cuts short Mexico trip, but Tsy says only for "regular" business.</p>
<p>The dollar closed nearly unchanged in the U.S. versus the mark and yen, but rose against sterling, which crumbled after a wire report stated an anonymous Labour Party source supports a weaker pound, dealers said.</p>
<p>The pound fell over two cents after a Bridge News report quoted an unnamed Labour source as saying sterling should rejoin Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in 2001 at a rate of 2.50 marks, well below its current 2.7790 mark rate, traders said.</p>
<p>The dollar closed at 125.05/10 yen versus 125.00/10 at Wednesday's open, and 1.7190/00 marks compared to 1.7195/05.</p>
<p>Sterling melted to $1.6150/60 from $1.6372/82.</p>
<p>Sterling's steep slide was proof of market nervousness over the embryonic dollar policy of the Labour Party, which ended 18-years of Conservative Party rule in last week's landslide election victory.</p>
<p>"The news story states that the Labour Party does in fact have a bias towards a weaker currency, not wanting to hinder employment from the export side," said David Durrant, senior currency strategist at I.D.E.A. consultancy.</p>
<p>"But they also want a little tighter interest rate policy, so they are on both sides of the fence," Durrant added.</p>
<p>The UK raised its official interest rate 25 basis points to 6.25 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Earlier, the U.S. currency shed a full yen, hitting a low of 124.60 yen, after Japan's Kyodo news agency reported an unnamed international monetary source as saying Germany, the United States and Japan were exploring the possibility of intervening to support the ailing yen.</p>
<p>The dollar has risen 10 percent so far this year against the yen, reaching a 56-month high of 127.47 yen on May 1.</p>
<p>Dollar volatility versus the yen was exacerbated by conflicting remarks from two Japanese Ministry of Finance officials over Japan's readiness to intervene and a surge in Japan's trade surplus.</p>
<p>MOF official Eisuke Sakakibara said it would be difficult to procure funds for intervention directly from the money market, while another official told Reuters Japan can, if needed, use some $220 billion of external reserves.</p>
<p>"If the Japanese do want to go forward with intervention, they have more than ample foreign exchange reserves to sell dollars," said Ben Strauss, an assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer and Co.</p>
<p>"Right now, I think the G3 (Group of Three) doesn't have thewill to intervene and frankly is not all that concerned. Currentlevels are appropriate from a fundamental economic standpoint," he added.</p>
<p>Japan posted a customs-cleared trade surplus of 352.67 billion yen in the first 20 days of April, a swing from a 59.06 billion deficit in the same period last year.</p>
<p>There was no indication outside of Japan that intervention was being discussed. Officials at Germany's central bank and the U.S. Treasury declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p>Traders also said dollar/yen's early slip reflects diminishing prospects for a Federal Reserve rate rise at the May20 policy-setting meeting and prospects Japan may soon raise interest rates, which currently lie at historic lows.</p>
<p>"The lower dollar is a factor of possible intervention and the possible turning of Japanese interest rates. The dollar could keep softer versus the yen for the next couple of weeks," said Mark Gargano, head of currency derivatives at First Union National Bank.</p>
<p>Also depressing the dollar was a 140 point drop in the Dow industrials and a near full-point loss in the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond.</p>
<p>The release of the Federal Reserve's latest summary of economic activity, called the Beige Book, did little to change economists' U.S. interest rate outlook.</p>
<p>The central bank said the U.S. economy expanded moderately over the past two months with wages and retail sales remaining generally subdued.</p>
<p>In other trading, the dollar was nearly flat at 1.4581/86 Swiss francs from 1.4580/90, but rose to Canadian $1.3817/22 from C$1.3811/16. The Australian dollar ended at $0.7766/71.</p>
