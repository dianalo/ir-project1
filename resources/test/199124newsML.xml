<p>The soccer association of Estonia on Tuesday said it had preliminary agreement from Scottish and Cypriot soccer officials to replay a World Cup qualifier with Scotland in Cyprus on February 11.</p>
<p>"I got acceptances by telephone this morning from the Cypriot Football Federation and also from the Scottish Football Association," Sulev Pohlak, a member of the board of the Estonian Football Association, said.</p>
<p>The original group four game  on October 9 ended in farce when it was stopped after three seconds after the Estonian team failed to turn up for a rescheduled kick-off.</p>
<p>Soccer's ruling body FIFA originally awarded the game to Scotland with a 3-0 victory but later ruled that the Estonians were not given enough warning about the earlier time and said it should be replayed.</p>
<p>Estonia wanted to play the tie in Cyprus in February as its team would be training on the island at that time.</p>
