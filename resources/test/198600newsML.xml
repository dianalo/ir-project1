<p>Interim earnings figures from more than 550 major Japanese firms showed an average increase in profit of nearly 15 percent, a corporate survey showed on Monday.</p>
<p>Wako Research Institute of Economics said the parent current profits of the firms increased by an average of 14.52 percent in the first half of the 1996/97 business year.</p>
<p>Current profit is pre-tax profit which includes gains and losses made on securities investments and other non-operating activities.</p>
<p>The research arm of Wako Securities Co based its figures on the interim parent current profit results of 565 firms.</p>
<p>It tracks 766 large companies, all of which are listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and have business years ending on March 31.</p>
<p>The list does not include banks, brokerages or insurance firms. Not all the firms have released their interim results yet.</p>
<p>The after-tax parent profit of the 565 firms increased 14.67 percent in the interim period compared with the previous year, while parent sales were up 4.65 percent, the survey said.</p>
<p>The parent current profits of car makers and auto parts manufacturers surged 152.97 percent, while those of real estate developers dropped by an average of 67.64 percent, the survey said.</p>
<p>The average year-on-year gain in the 565 firms' parent current profits in the previous six-month period to March 31 was 29.01 percent, Wako said.</p>
