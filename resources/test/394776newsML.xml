<p>Belgian hamburger restaurant chain operator Quick NV said on Friday it plans to offer more chicken-based products after net profit plunged 48 percent in 1996 because of the mad cow scare.</p>
<p>"Beef remains our core business, but we are planning to launch new products, notably based on chicken," Quick CEO Thomas Meisser told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said that for every 100 meals sold in the second half of 1996, 15 percent were chicken-based, compared to nine percent in the first half of 1995.</p>
<p>Quick reported 1996 earnings fell to 312 million Belgian francs from 598 million francs despite a 10 percent rise in sales to 21.5 billion francs.</p>
<p>Quick blamed the drop on the panic over beef that followed the exposure of a possible link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and brain disease in humans and price competition with arch rivals McDonald's .</p>
<p>"The European crisis over mad cow disease has led to changes in the eating patterns of a number of consumers, who until now have not regained full confidence in beef," Meisser said.</p>
<p>Meisser said Quick expected sales to grow another 10 percent in 1997, but would not venture a profit forecast.</p>
<p>As well as launching new products, the group would also seek to expand faster in the Netherlands, opening 50 to 70 new stores there before the year 2000.</p>
<p>At the end of 1996 Quick had 105 restaurants in Belgium, 258 in France (which account for the bulk of its sales), five in the Netherlands and three in Luxembourg.</p>
