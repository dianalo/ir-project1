<p>United Telecom (Unicom) will lay a 7,050-km (4,380-mile) underwater cable -- China's longest telecom trunk -- linking Beijing and 27 major coastal cities, the Xinhua news agency said on Monday.</p>
<p>The project would involve investment of 2.0 billion yuan ($241 million) and add 150,000 telephone lines to national capacity, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>Unicom and Japan's NEC Corp signed a cooperation contract on August 12, the agency said without giving details of the deal.</p>
<p>The cable would run between the northeastern industrial city of Dandong in Liaoning province and Beihai in the southern province of Guangxi, it said.</p>
<p>A section of the cable, measuring 110 km (68 miles) and connecting Shenzhen and Zhuhai in southern Guangdong province, would cost $4.2 million, Xinhua said. Construction of the Shenzhen-Zhuhai section was scheduled to be completed within six months.</p>
