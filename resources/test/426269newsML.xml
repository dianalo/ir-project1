<p>Hungary's biggest farmers' union appealed on Friday for talks with the government to overhaul the country's agriculture sector and threatened protests if they were turned down. "(The union) will make another attempt to settle justified demands through talks," MOSZ said in a statement. "We do not rule out the possibility of future demonstrations."</p>
<p>The demands are based on a January 15 general meeting decision, asking the government for a comprehensive overhaul of Hungary's ailing agriculture sector, including a revision of land ownership regulations and a "predictable" subsidy policy.</p>
<p>MOSZ also asked that concessions granted to a group of protesting farmers from central Hungary to reduce social security contributions should be extended to cooperatives.</p>
<p>The union said it would consider taking "further steps" if "meaningful talks" were not under way within a week.</p>
<p>Last week, the government agreed to demands from a group of farmers from the central town of Kiskoros to ease social security and tax burdens but stopped short of reversing 1997 farm taxation and social security rules.</p>
<p>The Kiskoros farmers, who set up roadblocks and have since formed their own organisation, METESZ, hardened their stance and snubbed Prime Minister Gyula Horn's invitation to further talks after unsuccessful negotiations with finance and agriculture ministry officials.</p>
<p>Following the failed meeting Horn said the government felt the talks with farmers were concluded while Finance Minister Peter Medgyessy's said he was unwilling to agree to "any substantial change affecting the proportionate sharing of tax burdens".</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Frigyes Nagy, who on Friday presented the government's farming policy draft to journalists, confirmed the government's stance.</p>
<p>"Even if there is a demonstration, the government will not negotiate," Nagy said.</p>
<p>METESZ was still blocking roads on Friday around Kiskoros.</p>
