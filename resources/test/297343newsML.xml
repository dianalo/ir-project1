<title>USA: Texaco fires finance exec in discrimination scandal.</title>

<p>By Gail Appleson, Law Correspondent</p>
<p>Texaco Inc. said Wednesday it fired a top insurance subsidiary executive and permanently suspended benefits to two former executives as part of the investigation into racial discrimination at the company.</p>
<p>The actions came after Texaco received a final report by an outside investigator who examined a tape recording of the executives discussing destruction of evidence in a racial discrimination lawsuit against the White Plains, N.Y., company. They also allegedly were recorded making racist remarks.</p>
<p>Publicity over the tape, which was submitted as part of evidence in the lawsuit, engulfed Texaco in scandal and led to a $176.1 million tentative settlement of the lawsuit, believed to be the biggest accord ever in such a case.</p>
<p>"Behavior which violates the company's policies will not be tolerated," Texaco said in a letter to employees announcing the actions. "Consistently strong ethical behaviour is at the root of a strong image and reputation, which we fully intend to restore."</p>
<p>Final terms of the settlement were scheduled to be filed Friday in federal court in White Plains. As part of those proceedings, Texaco agreed last week to let the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission intervene in the lawsuit and monitor the company's compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws.</p>
<p>In the latest development, the company said it fired David Keough, a top finance executive at an insurance subsidiary after receiving a final report from outside attorney Michael Armstrong of New York's Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart.</p>
<p>Texaco said it had turned the report over to the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, which is investigating the matter.</p>
<p>The company said prosecutors had advised it not to make the report public because of the continuing criminal investigation.</p>
<p>In addition to firing Keough, Texaco said it was taking the strongest action possible under corporate policies against Richard Lundwall, former senior coordinator for personnel services in its finance department and former Treasurer Robert Ulrich, who retired.</p>
<p>The company had temporarily cut benefits to the two men but said it now was permanently suspending all benefits that are legally allowable.</p>
<p>Lundwall, who was forced into retirement in August as part of staff reductions, is currently facing a criminal obstruction of justice charge as well. The government had requested a continuance in the case last month when it began negotiating with the defendant.</p>
<p>Texaco said it also was suspending Peter Meade, a manager in the fuel and marine marketing department, for two weeks without pay.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the men were not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>Lundwall secretly made the inflammatory tapes in 1994 as part of his duties in taking minutes of the executives' meetings. He turned the tapes over to plaintiffs lawyers in the discrimination case after he was forced out of the company during the summer.</p>
<p>The men can be heard discussing shredding documents requested as part of court proceedings and referring to minority employees as "black jelly beans."</p>
<p>As part of the proposed settlement, Texaco released a plan last month to boost employment, career development and recruiting of minorities, as well as increasing purchasing from minority- and women-owned companies.</p>
<p>The plan was well-received by lawyers representing the black plaintiffs and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who responded by calling for an end to a consumer boycott of Texaco he helped initiate in November.</p>
