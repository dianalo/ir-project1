<p>Serbia's opposition rallied tens of thousands of supporters in Belgrade on Wednesday evening, dismissing talk of dialogue until ruling Socialists reinstate results of local elections.</p>
<p>Riot police kept a low profile for the second straight day and allowed protesters to block traffic in the capital as they marched from outlying districts to the city centre.</p>
<p>Jubilant demonstrators who jammed central Republic Square said they felt they had won a victory against authorities who had previously tried to push the marchers onto pavements.</p>
<p>Zoran Djindjic, one of the leaders of the opposition Zajedno (Together) opposition coalition, vowed to keep up pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic's Socialists until they recognised opposition victories in municipal polls.</p>
<p>"We have been here for seventy days, but we shall last seven hundred days, if need be," Djindjic told the crowd.</p>
<p>Reacting to reports that Milosevic was preparing compromise proposals to defuse the deepening political crisis, Djindjic said Zajedno would stick to its minimum demands.</p>
<p>"They say the president has some new ideas, he will announce them in a day or two...We say we will listen to all of his ideas - but only after the November 17 election results are recognised."</p>
<p>A Russian envoy told reporters earlier on Wednesday that Milosevic would soon offer proposals in an attempt to halt daily protests that have posed the most serious threat to his authoritarian rule since he rose to power nearly 10 years ago.</p>
<p>First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, whose government has tended to promote friendly relations with Belgrade, said Milosevic wanted to establish a constructive "dialogue".</p>
<p>"Both the authorities and opposition realise there is no solution with the use of force and in that respect they express great restraint and do not go for provocations," said Ivanov, who also had talks with Zajedno leaders.</p>
<p>Milosevic has so far failed to halt the protests through a mixture of piecemeal concessions, a hostile media campaign and sporadic police violence.</p>
<p>Earlier, an estimated 20,000 students packed into Slavija Square, tying up traffic in the heart of the city before midday. There were no riot police in evidence.</p>
<p>They then marched for two hours on boulevards, past the offices of state television and the state-run newspaper Politika, where people waved from fire escapes to students who blew whistles and shouted: "Join us".</p>
<p>Police this month stopped students from marching for eight successive days and had been generally enforcing a ban on protests blocking street traffic.</p>
<p>Diplomats were cautious in assessing police behaviour, saying it was unclear whether authorities were backing down for good or merely pausing before taking a tougher line.</p>
<p>Analysts say the 80,000-strong police force and state television remain the two pillars of Milosevic's power.</p>
<p>More than 10 weeks of protests sparked by annulled election results have turned into a referendum on Milosevic and five decades of unbroken rule by socialists and their communist predecessors.</p>
<p>"If the regime returns our votes, tomorrow it will also have to return our money and everything it ever stole from us, from 1944 until today," said Vuk Draskovic, another Zajedno leader.</p>
