<p>The ECOFIN Council failed to agree on Monday on a pact to ensure countries keep their budgets stable after the 1999 start of economic and monetary union (EMU), German finance state secretary Juergen Stark said.</p>
<p>In the meeting, Germany held out for a strict "stability pact", standing by its original proposals for heavy sanctions against countries that allow their budget deficits to exceed three percent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>Unlike other prospective EMU participants, it also wants a numerical definition of a recession severe enough to allow countries to avoid such sanctions.</p>
<p>Stark, who took German Finance Minister Theo Waigel's place at the meeting, said the content of the hoped-for consensus was more important than reaching agreement by a specific deadline.</p>
<p>"Sanctions are an important, a necessary element for us," Stark told journalists at a briefing.</p>
<p>"In the end we will present a credible stability pact to the public. I am optimistic we will be able to quantify the definitions. If the Commission is not yet ready to reach consensus, that means we need more time."</p>
<p>The EU has been hoping to agree a post-EMU stability pact by the summit of EU leaders in Dublin on December 13 and 14.</p>
<p>Most European countries have agreed on a formula that would fine countries 0.2 percent of GDP if their deficit exceeds three percent of GDP, and a further 0.1 percent for each percentage point up to a maximum fine of 0.5 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>But Germany seeks higher monetary sanctions starting at 0.25 percent of GDP, with no cap, Stark said.</p>
<p>Germany also hopes to the pact will define a severe recession as one that lasts for four consecutive quarters or more, or one in which a country's economic output declines by two percent or more in a single year.</p>
<p>Other countries are hoping to avoid numerical definitions, he said.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Stark threatened that Germany would pull out of the EMU process if the stability pact is watered down.</p>
