<p>A large swathe of northern India was without power on Friday after the failure of an electricity grid that supplies Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi states, power officials said.  </p>
<p>"The complete Delhi state has been hit by the failure," said Jagdish Kapoor, spokesman for the Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking (DESU), which is run by Delhi civic authorities.</p>
<p>"Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are without power," he added. "We have restored power in some areas (of Delhi) and expect the work to be complete before this evening."</p>
<p>The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that trains ground to halt across northern India soon after the failure occurred at 6.30 a.m. (0130 GMT).</p>
<p>The blackout resulted from a major fault in the electricity grid that supplies the neighbouring three states, Kapoor said.</p>
<p>"It is a failure in the northern grid," he said. "When there is a failure anywhere in the grid, all the states have to suffer." He had no details of the fault.</p>
<p>PTI quoted Delhi Chief Minister Sahib Singh Verma as saying the failure occurred because Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan had drawn more than their share of power from the grid.</p>
<p>It quoted Northern Railway officials as saying trains to Howrah and Bihar in the east, and Jhansi, Jaipur and Faridabad in the west had been delayed.</p>
