<p>Officials who surveyed parts of North Carolina Monday expressed disbelief over the extensive destruction left by Hurricane Fran and said it would take time to quantify the damage.</p>
<p>Hurricane Fran came ashore at Cape Fear in southeastern North Carolina on Thursday and ravaged the state with 120 mph (185 kmh) winds as it pushed northwest through the state.</p>
<p>Gov. Jim Hunt said he had not been given an estimate on damage to property and farms, although the State Emergency Response Team earlier announced projections for housing losses at $900 million and building losses at $30 million.</p>
<p>"This is the worst disaster we've had in this century," Hunt told a news conference. "This damage is so huge it's going to take significant time to do (the assessments)."</p>
<p>Hunt was joined by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who reiterated the government's pledge to help hurricane victims with food assistance and emergency farm loans.</p>
<p>The Clinton Administration said on Friday it would provide food stamps and waive some standard requirements in order to help the most severely affected disaster victims. Low-interest loans to family farmers also were announced.</p>
<p>North Carolina corn, cotton and soybeans were damaged by Fran's fury. Much of the state's top crop, tobacco, spoiled in barns when lack of electricity interrupted the curing process.</p>
<p>The state leads the nation in tobacco production, growing more than $1 billion worth of the crop per year.</p>
<p>"We've got substantial loss to tobacco. Most of it was in the barns and it's sour now. You will have to throw it out," Hunt said, noting that many farmers' barns were destroyed.</p>
<p>Hunt, himself a livestock farmer, said that his ranch had suffered significant damage as Fran blew through.</p>
<p>Charles Harvey, executive vice president of the Tobacco Growers Association of North Carolina, said hot air needs to be blown over picked tobacco within 48 to 72 hours or it rots.</p>
<p>"It is my estimate that we will do well to produce 80 percent of the North Carolina quota (about 600 million pounds). We will be short some 60 or 70 million pounds," he said.</p>
<p>While the federal government has been in a battle with the tobacco industry over proposed regulation of cigarettes, Glickman said President Clinton was supportive of tobacco farmers as they sought to recover.</p>
