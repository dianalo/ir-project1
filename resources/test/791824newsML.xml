<p>Spanish government bonds ended a quiet session higher on Monday, following other markets as no fresh factors emerged domestically, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Bonds have gone through the day without pain or glory. We are depending on foreign bonds and we don't have anything new," an analyst said.</p>
<p>But the market is looking ahead to domestic consumer price data on Wednesday and the regular repo auction at the Bank of Spain on Thursday.</p>
<p>"If CPI is 1.6 percent as forecast then there is no reason to expect anything from the central bank," the analyst said.  </p>
<p>The market expects the next Spanish rate cut to follow the government's official presentation to Congress of the 1998 budget.</p>
<p>Abroad, the market is looking to the Bundesbank repo on Tuesday for hints on the future of monetary policy in Germany.</p>
