<p>France's 1997 budget will produce the key deficit number needed to qualify for European monetary union but the central government deficit is higher than most had expected and disappointing, economists said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"This budget overall looks broadly credible, though the numbers themselves are not looking too good. Analysis based purely on the numbers would say they've not done too much at all," said economist Sean Shepley at CS First Boston bank.</p>
<p>Figures leaked by the government to several newspapers and reported on Wednesday put the central government deficit at 283.6 billion francs ($55.21 billion), versus the 288 billion forecast for 1996.</p>
<p>"It looks to me as though this is a budget which achieves a cut in the deficit level primarily by a number of accounting measures," Shepley added.</p>
<p>Newspapers reported that the government intended to cut its public deficit in 1997 to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>They said the central government deficit, to be officially presented later in the day, would be 283.6 billion francs, well above the government target of less than 250 billion.</p>
<p>"It's quite disappointing, this smaller-than-expected cut in the central government deficit -- it will be 3.5 percent of GDP in 1997," said JP Morgan economist David Naude.</p>
<p>"This doesn't mean total deficits can't be brought down to three percent but it does mean they have to find half a point of GDP elsewhere," he added.</p>
<p>The central government budget deficit is the most readily identifable component of the total public deficit used for the purposes of the Maastricht Treaty, which sets out the economic requirements for a single currency. The welfare deficit and local authority deficit also go into Maastricht calculations's.</p>
<p>"The interesting point is that the government is saying it is being conservative to the extent that it is not looking for cuts it would not be able to deliver. But in reality it's being conservative because they're facing a shortfall in revenue," said Naude.</p>
<p>"Basically, it tells you that even preliminary to the 1997 plan there is a problem for this year," he added.</p>
<p>The papers reported that the budget would keep a commitment of freezing central government spending at the 1996 level, which is expected to be 1,552.9 billion francs.</p>
<p>The daily Le Figaro said debt charges for the government would rise from 226 billion in 1996 to 245 billion in 1997 and that civil service pay would climb by 1.7 percent. Spending cuts would be more than 60 billion francs and government spending would rise by 1.5 percent next year.</p>
<p>The government's budget projects that receipts will rise by 2.0 percent next year, Le Figaro said.</p>
<p>Eric Chaney, economist at Morgan Stanley, said of the 284 billion central government deficit figure: "If it's true, it's a bit surprising. I'd prefer to wait for the budget itself but I don't like what I read in the papers."</p>
<p>On the plus side, the government looked like it was trying to be transparent. But the budget was "much softer" than was expected three to four months ago, he said.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Germany is looking for evidence that France is cutting its budget deficits by structural reform.</p>
<p>"My worry is it looks possible there'll be a quality gap" between the German and French fiscal packages," Chaney said.</p>
<p>To get total public deficits to three percent or less of GDP next year, the government is banking on spending cuts, but also a measure of creative accounting.</p>
<p>The central government budget figure of 283.6 billion after 25 billion francs of tax cuts is only about four billion less than the forecast 1996 deficit.</p>
<p>Among other things, the government is set to include funds transferred from France Telecom -- 37.5 billion francs is being handed over to cover future pension liability at France Telecom -- to make the Maastricht deficit mathematics works out.</p>
<p>An accounting surplus from the CADES welfare debt repayment fund and a surplus in the national unemployment fund UNEDIC are also being counted on. ($1=5.137 French Franc)</p>
