<p>Britain's gas industry regulator on Monday attacked an opposition Labour Party suggestion that utility companies which make "excess" profits should be forced to share them with customers.</p>
<p>Director General of Gas Supply Clare Spottiswoode said such a scheme would be likely to prompt companies to disguise profit levels, making the regulatory process more difficult.</p>
<p>In evidence to parliament's Trade and Industry Committee, Spottiswoode noted calls for a modification of the existing system under which gas prices are linked to retail prices under an RPI-x formula by including a profit sharing mechanism.</p>
<p>Spottiswoode did not directly mention the fact that leading Labour figures had suggested that profits above a certain level should be returned in part to customers through lower prices.</p>
<p>But she said that while such an idea was "on the face of it appealing", there were fears that it could harm incentives for firms to reduce costs.</p>
<p>Spottiswoode added: "Profit sharing also introduces serious complications in measuring appropriate profits. Companies subject to such a regime are likely to respond by disguising profit levels."</p>
<p>"This reduces the transparency of the regulatory process and is likely to result in prolonged and detailed arguments between company and regulator," she said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 5427767</p>
