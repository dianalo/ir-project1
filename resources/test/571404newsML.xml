<p>National Investment Fund (NFI) No. 3 in Poland's mass privatisation scheme made a net profit of four million zlotys in the first quarter of 1997, the fund said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>NFI 3, which did not report results for the first quarter of 1996, made a net loss of 50 million zlotys for all of that year.</p>
<p>NFI 3 said its net assets amounted to 345.5 million zlotys in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Under the government's NFI programme, shares in about 500 mid-sized companies are allocated to 15 NFIs run by foreign and domestic management firms.</p>
<p>From May 12, the 26 million Poles who bought a participation unit in the scheme will be entitled to exchange it for 15 shares, one in each fund, which are expected to start trade on the Warsaw bourse around mid-year.</p>
<p>Each NFI has 31,026,185 shares.</p>
<p>The units lose their validity on December 31, 1998.</p>
