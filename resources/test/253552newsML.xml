<p>The airline said earlier on Thursday that a total of 92 flights during the day would be cancelled due to the work stoppage and would affect about 6,500 passengers.</p>
<p>The airline said its afternoon flight schedule had been normalised to a large extent after the work stoppage by flight staff and technical workers who are members of the DAG white-collar union.</p>
<p>The union has demanded that Lufthansa shorten the duration of its current contract offer at 27 months and offer a higher wage increase than the existing offer of 1.7 percent.</p>
<p>Lufthansa has already signed a contract with the same terms it is offering to the DAG with the OeTV public-sector workers' union, which represents blue-collar workers and ground personnel at the airline, which has more than 50,000 workers.</p>
