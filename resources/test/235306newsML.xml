<p>Austrian Finance Minister Viktor Klima said he and Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi agreed there should be no watering down of the Maastricht criteria for European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>"Italy and Austria agree that there must not be a change in the convergence criteria, which ensure stability," Klima told a news conference after meeting Ciampi.  </p>
<p>Klima said he attached great importance to Italian membership of a future single European currency. Italy is Austria's second most important trading partner.</p>
<p>"It is of special importance to Austria that Italy will become a member of EMU as soon as possible," Klima said.</p>
<p>He reiterated that he was confident Austria would meet all the Maastricht criteria for European economic and monetary union "in a sustainable way". -- Vienna Newsroom, 43-1-53112-258</p>
