<p>South Korea's Supreme Court on Thursday rebuffed prosecution appeals for harsher sentences against former presidents Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae-woo over a 1979 coup and an army massacre a year later.</p>
<p>It upheld a lower court's decision in December to commute Chun's death sentence to life in jail and Roh's 22-1/2 year jail term to 17 years in connection with Chun's seizing power and the massacre in the city of Kwangju.</p>
