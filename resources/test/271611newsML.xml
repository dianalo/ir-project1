<p>Ethiopian authorities said on Saturday they would sell more than 18,000 houses nationalised by ousted Marxist dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam in the capital.</p>
<p>Getachew Regassa, general manager of a company responsible for the sale of state-administered houses, told local media "appropriate compensation would be given to former owners of the houses".</p>
<p>He did not say if the government would allow the owners the right to repossess their property if they chose to.</p>
<p>"With respect to the sale of nationalised houses, my office is entrusted with two basic tasks -- paying compensation to previous owners and privatising nationalised houses through sale to the private sector," Getachew said.</p>
<p>Mengistu's government nationlised private properties in Ethiopia under policies designed to bring the Horn of African country's economy under centralised state control. Mengistu was toppled in May 1991 and is exiled in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The government administers 27,000 houses in the capital Addis Abbaba alone. Getachew did not give an estimated market cost for the houses and did not say how they would be sold.</p>
