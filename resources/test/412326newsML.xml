<p>Japanese institutional investors are planning to scale back their bond investments in March for the first time in eight months and boost their equity holdings, a Reuters investment survey showed on Friday.</p>
<p>Although investors are not expecting any major factors to disrupt global financial markets in the short term, there are still worries about Wall Street's record high stock levels and the Tokyo market's inability to pull out of the doldrums.</p>
<p>The Reuters monthly Global Asset Allocation survey, which asked 16 Japan-based financial institutions about their recommended investment strategy for March, showed the average overall portfolio weighting for bonds falling 0.83 percentage point to 40.50 percent from the previous month's survey.</p>
<p>Although the weighting for bonds fell for the first time since July 1996, it still managed to stay above 40 percent.</p>
<p>The average overall weighting for equities rose 1.42 percentage points to 47.17 percent, the first time it has risen in five months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the average weighting for cash fell 0.59 percentage point to 12.33 percent.</p>
<p>As for equities, investors plan to reduce their investments in Britain, Japan and to a lesser extent, the United States.</p>
<p>Investors are putting more money into the Asian stock markets, as Asia's overall weighting rose for the fourth straight month and above the 10 percent mark for the first time in five months. Asia's weighting rose 0.06 percentage point to 10.03 from the previous survey.</p>
<p>The weighting for the American and Canadian stock markets fell for the first time in six months, down a marginal 0.04 percentage point to 40.79 percent.</p>
<p>Investors continued to reduce their holdings in Japanese stocks, with Tokyo's weighting dropping to the lowest level since the survey began in June 1994.</p>
<p>Japanese stocks' weighting slipped for the sixth consecutive month to 23.10 percent, down 0.53 percentage point from the previous survey. It has dropped more than 10 percentage points over the past six months.</p>
<p>As for bonds, weightings for the American, Canadian, British, French and German markets rose, while Japan and other European and Asian markets declined.</p>
<p>The investors see U.S. bonds as the most attractive investment vehicle, with their weighting rising to 40.42 percent, up 0.62 from the previous survey.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the weighting for the Japanese bond market dropped for the third consecutive month.</p>
