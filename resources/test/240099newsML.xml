<headline>U.S. High Court to decide Alaska coastline case.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-12-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Supreme Court said Friday it would decide a 17-year-old dispute between the federal government and Alaska over the ownership of certain lands beneath the tidal waters along the state's Arctic coast.</p>
<p>The court will decide if the U.S. government or the state owns coastal submerged lands that are key parts of the National Petroleum Reserve and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, major federal reservations along Alaska's North Slope.</p>
<p>At stake is whether more than $1.4 billion in oil and gas revenues from the disputed lands will go to the federal government or to the state.</p>
<p>The case began in 1979 when the federal government filed a high court request to bring the complaint. The state did not oppose the move and the court named a special judicial officer, who held hearings and issued a report in March.</p>
<p>The federal government and the state then filed various objections to the 15 key recommendations in the report. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case next year and will issue a final decision in the dispute.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said the case would determine if the court continued to adhere to its past rulings in deciding the location of coastlines.</p>
