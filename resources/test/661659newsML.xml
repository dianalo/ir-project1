<p>"I had a feeling something good was going to happen tonight," Steve Kerr said after hitting the shot that brought the Chicago Bulls their fifth NBA championship Friday.</p>
<p>Nothing had been very good previously in the Finals for the slight, self-deprecating backup point guard.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old, nine-year NBA veteran missed a key 3-pointer in Game 4 and did not have his usual sharpshooting touch throughout the championship series.</p>
<p>But Finals Most Valuable Player Michael Jordan still had the faith to pass to him when the game was on the line.</p>
<p>"Steve's been fighting with himself because of Game 4, (when) he missed a 3-pointer," said Jordan.</p>
<p>Jordan said Kerr's wife confided in him just how upset Kerr had been after his Game 4 miss.</p>
<p>"He kept his head in the pillow for hours because he let the team down, because everyone knows he's probably one of the best shooters in the game and he had an opportunity to pick us up and give us a lift. And he was very disappointed," Jordan said.</p>
<p>Jordan told Kerr during a timeout before the big shot that he expected Utah's John Stockton to leave Kerr and double-team him. He noted that as Bulls coach Phil Jackson drew up the designated play at the end, "everybody in the gym, everybody on TV knew it was coming to me."</p>
<p>"I looked at Steve and said, 'this is your chance' because I know Stockton is going to come over and help," said Jordan.</p>
<p>"'And I'm going to come to you,' and he said, 'Give me the ball,'" Jordan recalled.</p>
<p>"I said, 'I'll be ready, I'll knock it down,'" said Kerr, but he admitted that he wasn't so sure.</p>
<p>"I'm just so thankful to be able to be a teammate of Michael's because this opportunity would never have presented itself without Michael's presence. He's so unbelievable, and he's so good that he draws so much attention.</p>
<p>"And his excellence gave me the chance to hit the game-winning shot in the NBA Finals. What a thrill," Kerr gushed.</p>
<p>"And I owe him everything," added Kerr, who was born in Beirut where his father, head of the American school there, was assassinated.</p>
<p>"Tonight Steve Kerr earned his wings from my perspective, because I had faith in him and I passed him the ball and he knocked the shot down," said Jordan. "I'm glad he was able to redeem himself because if he'd have missed that shot, I don't think he could have slept all summer long."</p>
<p>Kerr was a little late coming to the interview room at the United Centre.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I didn't know where this room was, I've never been here," he explained to reporters. "But I'm happy to be here, believe me."</p>
