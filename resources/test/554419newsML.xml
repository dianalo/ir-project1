<p>Canadian Conservative leader Jean Charest said that if elected prime minister he would devote one-third of any fiscal surplus to new spending, one-third to debt reduction and the remainder for possible tax cuts.</p>
<p>"Our plan is a 10-year plan. Our objective by the end of the 10-year plan...is to reduce the federal debt -- once we've balanced the books by the year 2000 -- to reduce the federal debt from 73 percent of GDP (gross domestic product) to 50 percent of GDP by the end of the 10-year plan," he said.</p>
<p>"And to do that we would apply a third of the surplus to the reduction of the debt, and a third of the other amount of money would be applied to the spending we have planned for in this program -- things like health care, for example, or education initiatives.</p>
<p>"And another third would be there to be used for tax cuts, and would then be allocated in regards to the choices we would make in the second part of that plan."</p>
<p>He was addressing a news conference a day after the ruling Liberals, far ahead in national polls, said that once the books are balance they would spend half of any surplus and apply the other half to debt reduction and tax relief.</p>
<p>The Conservatives differ from both the Liberals and the Conservatives' tax-cutting rivals by offering a 10 percent cut in personal income taxes immediately but not balancing the budget as quickly.</p>
<p>Reform wants to balance the budget more quickly and then offer tax cuts.</p>
