<p>Ready delivery sugar prices held steady amid scant business while mill delivery climbed on the back of increased outstation buying, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Ready delivery sugar S-30 was stable at 1,480/1,500 rupees per quintal, as was sugar M-30 at 1,490/1,535 rupees per quintal. Trading remained slow, with consumer buying sluggish and limited supplies keeping prices in a narrow band.</p>
<p>"A rise in sugar mill delivery prices failed to cheer up the market sentiment in ready delivery due to poor local offtake," one broker said.</p>
<p>Mill delivery S-30 rose to 1,420/1,435 rupees per quintal from 1,410/1,420, while M-30 rose to 1,440/1,455 rupees per quintal from 1,430/1,440.</p>
<p>Traders said higher outstation offtake at the mill level, especially from southern states, curtailed supplies to the local market, leaving sentiment firm at the close of the session.</p>
