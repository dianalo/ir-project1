<p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) member state of Abu Dhabi plans to set up a 100 million dirham ($27 million) joint stock firm to promote tourism and boost its hotel industry, newspapers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A law establishing the National Corporation for Tourism and Hotels said the Abu Dhabi government would hold 20 percent of the new body and the state-owned Abu Dhabi Investment Company would have five percent.</p>
<p>The remaining shares, valued at 100 dirhams each, will be issued to UAE nationals employed by Abu Dhabi for more than 15 years with monthly salaries not exceeding 5,000 dirhams. Retired Abu Dhabi employees with similar service record and salary levels will also be eligible to acquire shares in the new body.</p>
<p>The law limited the number of shares that can be acquired by an individual to 500 shares.</p>
<p>It was not clear wether the new issues will be traded on the UAE unofficial stock exchange. A 54 percent free issue to social welfare beneficiaries in a government-owned dairy group in August restricted trading in the group's shares for five years.</p>
<p>"Under the law, the corporation will buy three hotels from the Abu Dhabi government valued at 350 million dirhams," said the daily English language Emirates News.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the deal will be financed by a soft loan from the government of Abu Dhabi payable over 20 years with a five-year grace period.</p>
<p>Analysts said the new firm is part of a master plan to diversify the emirate's oil-driven economy, re-distribute accumulated wealth and create profitable business opportunities for small investors. ($1=3.67 dirhams)</p>
