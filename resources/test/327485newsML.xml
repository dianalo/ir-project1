<p>Scotland's Colin Montgomerie made a solid start to the opening tournament of the 1997 European PGA tour on Thursday while a little-known quartet took an early lead.</p>
<p>Montgomerie, bidding to become Europe's top golfer for a fifth year in a row, unveiled a new driver to shoot a one-under par 71 in the first round in the 700,000 pound ($1.1 million) Johnnie Walker Classic to trail by four shots.</p>
<p>Englishman David Carter, India's Arjun Atwal and Australians Anthony Painter and Steve Conran top the leader board on five under 67 in the joint European and Australian tour event at the Hope Island resort course in Queensland.</p>
<p>"I have a new driver for the first time in five years and you are a bit tense with things like that," said Montgomerie, who revived his round with two birdies in his last four holes.</p>
<p>"The old one has won me millions of dollars over the years and I'll probably hang it up on the wall at home, but it was wearing out and needed changing," he told reporters.</p>
<p>Atwal, who paid his own airfare to Australia after Indian PGA officials made a request for him to play, took advantage of the early morning calm to fire three birdies in the opening six holes.</p>
<p>Most of the leaders exploited the more benign conditions in the morning before the wind picked up off the ocean.</p>
<p>Englishman Nick Faldo, making what will be one of his infrequent appearances on the European tour this season, described his form as rusty after his first round 70 late in the day.</p>
<p>"It was just a bit of a grind before things get comfortable and the confidence goes up. It's not smooth yet," said Faldo, the U.S. Masters champion, who was joined on two under by South Africa's Ernie Els.</p>
<p>American Fred Couples provided the most recognisable name at the top of the leader board. The former U.S. Masters champion joined a group of six players on four under at 68.</p>
<p>"I think 69 or 70 will be a good score on Saturday and Sunday when we play in the afternoon with the wind up. There won't be many 68s shot," Couples said.</p>
<p>But American John Daly faces a stern challenge to make the half-way cut after sinking to a dismal 77 on a links-type course designed by Australian former great Peter Thomson.</p>
<p>"I played like King Kong on the front nine and like absolute garbage on the back," said Daly, who refused to blame a recent hip complaint for his poor form.</p>
