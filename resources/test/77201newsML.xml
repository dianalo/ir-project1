<p>The judicial managers of troubled property and trading group Amcol Holdings Ltd want former managing director Kang Hwi Wah to buy its subsidiary Sankei Pte Ltd, the Business Times said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Quoting a banking source, the paper said Kang, who brought Sankei with him when he took control of Amcol in 1983, was being asked to buy the company back at its issued capital value of Singapore $10 million.</p>
<p>Kang would also have to help to clear Sankei's loans of over S$100 million, said the paper.  </p>
<p>Sankei's principal business is the trading and distribution of consumer electronic products.</p>
<p>Amcol was placed under judicial management in July after special auditors found the company had serious cashflow problems and had difficulty meeting its financial obligations.</p>
<p>Indonesia's Sinar Mas Group agreed to buy Amcol in August and to inject US$2.0 billion in assets.</p>
