<p>Delhi shares closed with modest gains, helped by mutual fund buying that was tempered by inconclusive election results in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Delhi Stock Exchange's sensitive index closed 3.99 points higher at 700.96.  </p>
<p>"Along with financial institutions houses, bull operators also indulged in cautious buying as the political scenario is not yet clear in India's largest state, Uttar Pradesh, where elections are just completed," said Harinder Singh of brokers Sanchi Securities.</p>
<p>With results in all but one of the 425 seats in the state assembly declared, the BJP had won only 177 seats in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>However, it is well short of majority required to form the govt on its own.</p>
<p>State Bank of India lost 4.65 rupees at 212.85 and Reliance Industries fell two rupees to 193.75.</p>
<p>Hindustan Lever rose 3.05 rupees to 785.05 while TISCO quoted 4.10 rupees higher at 173.10.</p>
