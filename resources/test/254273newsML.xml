<p>Heavy snow forced Alpine ski World Cup organisers to call off a women's giant slalom race on Friday.</p>
<p>There was no immediate announcement on when or where the race would be rescheduled.</p>
<p>A men's downhill practice due to take place on Friday afternoon was cancelled because of the weather and lack of visibility at the top of the OK piste. Officials said no decision had yet been made about Saturday's downhill race.</p>
<p>Italian Sabina Panzanini, winner of the last giant slalom held in Park City, Utah, last month, had been due to ski first in the women's race at 0830 GMT.</p>
<p>But the start was put back twice as snow continued to fall steadily and organisers finally called off the race after a forerunner had come down the course.</p>
<p>Heavy snowfalls forced the cancellation of the first men's downhill of the season in Whistler, British Columbia, earlier this month.</p>
