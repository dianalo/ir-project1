<p>The Cyprus economy will perform "marginally better" in 1997 than last year because of better economic conditions in Europe, the Cyprus Popular Bank said in a report.</p>
<p>The bank projects real gross domestic product growth of 2.4 percent in 1997, compared with its estimate of 2.0 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Government projections put GDP growth at 3.5 percent in 1997 and an estimated 2.5 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>The bank predicts inflation of 2.8 percent in 1997, which coincides with the official forecast. In December the year-on-year inflation was 2.51 percent. The bank expects unemployment to average 3.0 percent in 1987 compared with a government estimate of 2.9 percent.</p>
<p>The official estimates have not been revised for some months, in spite of indications of a slowdown in economic activity -- reinforced by the uncertain political climate on the militarily divided island.</p>
<p>"Figures have not been revised," said an official source. "With these new messages we have been getting, with tourism and the general climate, we shall have to see what we are going to do."</p>
<p>The Cyprus stock exchange hit a record low on Wednesday, with the main index falling to 77.45 from 78.36 on Tuesday. Analysts said investors were still concerned about the overall gloomy outlook for the economy and by threats from Turkey of a military strike if Cyprus went ahead with its purchase of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.</p>
<p>"The public is not convinced the rosy 3.5 percent growth outlook cited by the finance ministry will materialise," said Haris Christoforou, an economist and Finance Editor of the English-language daily newspaper Cyprus Mail.</p>
<p>The manufacturing sector, in decline in 1996, is expected to follow the same path in 1997 with the exception of an anticipated pickup in the paper and chemicals industry, Popular Bank said. Construction is also expected to hover at low levels throughout the year.</p>
<p>Tourism, which represents some 21 percent of GDP, is expected to remain low in spite of expectations of better arrival figures in 1997. An appreciation of the pound sterling will provide an impetus from the UK market, the bank said.</p>
<p>The number of arrivals on the eastern Mediterranean island declined by 6.5 percent to 2.32 million in the first 11 months of 1996 compared to the corresponding period in 1995, official figures show.</p>
<p>Popular Bank said that imports will rise 11 percent in 1997 the same rate of growth as 1996. Growth in total exports is expected to be 14.9 percent compared to 19.5 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>The chronic trade deficit will continue to rise in 1997 both in absolute terms and in relation to GDP. Popular Bank estimates a growth in the trade deficit to 1.167 billion pounds ($2.44) billion in 1997 over an estimated 1.08 billion pounds in 1996. The deficit in the trade balance is financed by a surplus in invisibles, mainly from tourism.</p>
<p>"As tourism is coming of age and further growth prospects are dissipating the ability to finance trade deficit through invisible surpluses will become increasingly limited," Popular said in its report. ($=0.47 pounds)</p>
