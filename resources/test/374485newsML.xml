<p>Micron Technology Inc Chairman and Chief Executive Steven Appleton said that the company expects to record a gain in the second quarter as a result of its recent completion of a secondary offering for Micron Electronics Inc.</p>
<p>Appleton said that the company could see a gain of about $0.50 in the quarter, but he cautioned that that number is an off-the-cuff estimate.</p>
<p>He also said the company has not yet allocated what to do with the funds that were generated from the offering.</p>
<p>Micron Technology, which is a developer of computer memory chips, will still own about 65 percent of Micron Electronics, which is a direct marketer of personal computers.</p>
<p>Appleton also said that the current trend in DRAM pricing has been up in the past month, but he declined to predict if that trend would continue.</p>
<p>Appleton said DRAM prices were up slightly in November, then trailed back down again in December and in January they were up again.</p>
<p>"But (pricing) has not been up that much," he said.</p>
<p>DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) chips are the biggest semiconductor component of personal computers.</p>
