<p>General Motors Corp. and the Canadian Auto Workers union stumbled over the key outsourcing issue on Tuesday, dimming hopes they could reach an agreement before a Wednesday midnight strike deadline.</p>
<p>CAW President Buzz Hargrove told reporters that GM Canada's lead negotiator Dean Munger retracted some offers on outsourcing that GM discussed at the table Monday night.</p>
<p>"Some of the things that we had talked about last night, Mr. Munger says he cannot meet the numbers that he was talking about on the reversal of current decisions on outsourcing," Hargrove said.</p>
<p>Hargrove hinted that Munger may have retracted the outsourcing proposals after conferring with GM Canada's parent in Detroit.</p>
<p>"The big picture is they're driving it, and there is no question about that," he said of GM's Detroit headquarters.</p>
<p>But GM Canada spokesman Stew Low said the idea that GM Canada was directed by Detroit on the issue was "not entirely true," and that the overnight change in the offer on the table was part of the normal "give and take" of bargaining.</p>
<p>"If something is on the table one day, it may or may not be there the next day, and quite frankly it could be back again the following day," said Low.</p>
<p>Hargrove declared the move a step backward and said he would try to keep restless local and subcommittee members talking to the company until the union caucus later Tuesday, when he will decide whether to break off lower-level talks.</p>
<p>"If nothing has broken loose to their satisfaction, then I said we'll call Mr. Munger in for a master committee meeting at six o'clock (6:00 p.m. EDT/2200 GMT) and we'll tell him that these discussions are now recessed until he starts moving," he said.</p>
<p>The union chose GM Canada on Monday as its second negotiating target after reaching agreement with Chrysler Corp.'s Canadian subsidiary in mid-September.</p>
<p>The Chrysler pact, ratified last weekend, halts plant sales and closings during the three-year agreement and commits Chrysler to replace any union jobs lost due to work done by outside contractors, known as outsourcing.</p>
<p>But GM, the world's largest carmaker, has shown little interest in accepting the terms the union won at Chrysler. Talks continued at a Toronto hotel on Tuesday and the union planned to hold a news conference in the evening to discuss the status of negotiations, a union official said.</p>
<p>At the heart of the disagreement is the CAW's determination to restrict outsourcing and reverse GM Canada's intentions to sell two plants and contract out jobs at several plants, for a loss of about 5,500 CAW jobs.</p>
<p>The union has approved an escalating strike strategy that would close a few GM plants at a time until all of its operations were shut down.</p>
<p>If no agreement is reached by the deadline, Hargrove said the union will shut down GM operations in Oshawa, Ontario and St. Therese, Quebec. He said members will walk out of GM's St. Catharines, Ontario plant on Oct. 6 and close down remaining plants in London and Windsor, Ontario, on Oct. 9.</p>
<p>Analysts said a strike could cost GM up to $150 million a week, halt production of some vehicle models and interrupt U.S. operations.</p>
<p>The CAW's $36.7 million strike fund is estimated to be enough for an eight-week strike and 16 weeks if the union mortgages some properties. The 28,000 union members at GM Canada would receive about $92 a week in strike pay if they walk off the job.</p>
<p>The union has called a special strike dues convention for the entire 210,000-member union on Oct. 18 as a contingency.</p>
