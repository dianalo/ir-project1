<p>Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on Monday called for dialogue with the new government of Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis which vowed to protest at a grenade attack against a Greek Orthodox centre in Istanbul.</p>
<p>"We want to solve the problems with Greece peacefully on the table and in a dialogue," Erbakan told journalists before a meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.</p>
<p>NATO allies Turkey and Greece have long been at odds over the divided island of Cyprus, sovereignty in the Aegean Sea and minority rights.</p>
<p>Tension again rose on Monday when Islamist urban guerrillas threw a grenade at the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul. No-one was injured in the early morning atack.</p>
<p>"We protest against this action and we will ask for a full investigation in order to shed light on how this incident happened," government spokesman Dimitris Reppas told reporters.</p>
<p>He said the building, the seat of Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomeos I should have been better guarded. Bartholomeos is the spiritual leader of 250 million Orthodox Christians.</p>
<p>Turkey and Greece came close to war in January over possession of uninhabited islets in the Aegean in a tense military standoff that was averted through U.S mediation.</p>
<p>"Greece's leadership will see that (dialogue) is the only wise path," Islamist Erbakan said. He did not specifically refer to the grenade attack.</p>
<p>Turkey has welcomed the re-election in late September of socialist Simitis whose conservative rival Miltiades Evert is regarded in Turkey as a hawk.</p>
