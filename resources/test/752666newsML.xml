<p>Mexico's department store sales rose 3.7 percent in June compared to the same month a year earlier, the National Association of Self-Service and Department Stores (ANTAD) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The association also said that supermarket sales fell 0.9 percent in June compared to the same month a year earlier.  </p>
<p>For the first six months of the year, department store sales rose 4.8 percent compared to the first half of 1996, ANTAD said.</p>
<p>Supermarket sales for the first half of this year fell 1.3 percent compared to the first half of 1996, the association said.  </p>
<p>Supermarket sales need to grow by 22.2 to return to levels from before the December 1994 peso crisis levels, ANTAD said.</p>
<p>Department store sales "appear to be consolidating the start of a recovery," ANTAD said, noting that department stores suffered even more than supermarkets from the crisis.</p>
<p>In June 1995, department store sales fell 37.9 percent compared to June 1994. Department store sales rose by 4.0 percent in June 1996 over June 1995.</p>
<p>ANTAD attributed the June 1997 increase in department store sales to stable inflation in recent months, high-profile discount offers and heightened competition within the sector.</p>
<p>Within department stores, white goods and clothes showed the best growth at 16.8 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively, ANTAD said.</p>
