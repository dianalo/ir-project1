<p>Slovak blue chips closed mostly down in moderate trading on the Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) on Thursday, driving the SAX index 0.96 points lower to 208.45.</p>
<p>Slovakia's largest commercial bank VUB was the biggest loser of the session, closing down 49 crowns at 1,800.</p>
<p>"Losses to VUB shares are logical after several weeks of increses which were not backed by any rational reasons," said Peter Krutil of Creditanstalt, adding that the share may fall further in the near future.</p>
<p>Steel maker VSZ lost 23 crowns to close at 627 and oil and gas storage firm Nafta fell 20 crowns to 2,030. Brokers said that despite the downard trend over last few days interest in Nafta was gradually becoming stronger.</p>
<p>"The recent fall below the 2,000 level was more or less caused by psychological sentiment and investors seem to be regaining interest in the share," Krutil said.</p>
<p>Oil refiner Slovnaft traded only six shares today and closed unchanged at 930. Brokers said the price would have to go down to around the 900 crown level to attract more interest.</p>
<p>Overall, volume increased to 482,436 shares from 340,642 on Wednesday, while turnover rose to 275.11 million crowns from 239.64 million.</p>
