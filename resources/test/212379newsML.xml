<headline>Mahathir says APEC talks with Australia cordial.</headline>

<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Saturday he held friendly talks with his Australian counterpart John Howard and neither man brought up the potentially explosive racism debate in Australia.</p>
<p>Mahathir told reporters after his 45-minute talk with Howard on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference that they had exchanged views on Asia-Pacific trade issues.</p>
<p>He said a racism row in Australia, sparked by maverick politician Pauline Hanson, did not come up in their talks.</p>
<p>In Sydney, more than 5,000 people turned out for a rally on Saturday against racism, joined by a coalition of mainly Asian ethnic groups, and marched to the prime minister's office.</p>
<p>Howard has been accused of not taking a strong enough stand against Hanson, whose views against Asian immigration and aboriginal welfare have struck a chord with voters.</p>
<p>Howard has consistentLy spoken against calls for a racially based immigration policy, but has been reluctant to reply directly to what he has termed the views of one legislator.</p>
<p>His stance has been criticised in Asian newspapers and has begun to intrude on Canberra's relations with the region.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi raised the issue with his Australian counterpart, Alexander Downer, in the Philippine capital ahead of Monday's APEC summit.</p>
<p>Mahathir said Howard had accepted an invitation to visit Malaysia next year.</p>
