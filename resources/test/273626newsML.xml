<p>Texaco Inc is in talks with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and plaintiff's lawyers to resolve differences over last month's settlement of a landmark race-bias lawsuit, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.</p>
<p>EEOC lawyer James Lee says the agency wants to work out its concerns before a court hearing scheduled January 3, at which the commission is expected to ask the judge to allow the agency to intervene to make sure the settlement is fair, the story said.</p>
