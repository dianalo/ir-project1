<p>U.S. domestic crude deltas failed to become dislodged Thursday despite a freefall in heating oil and outright crude prices.</p>
<p>Refiner demand amid tight arbitrage economics was cited as support for the near-term.</p>
<p>"Grades are holding well because nobody can get their hands on foreign cargoes without paying huge amounts," an East Coast trader said. He noted virtually no offers for delivered Brent, and a scarcity of other light, sweet crudes.</p>
<p>November West Texas Intermediate/Cushing was at $24.25-35 a barrel, down about 70 cents from Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Outright prices were deflated by profit taking in U.S. heating oil and European gas oil, and rumors Saudi Arabia supported a higher OPEC output celing.</p>
<p>But a later report dismissed the notion that Saudi Arabia intended to support OPEC raising its ceiling at the group's next meeting November 25, traders noted.</p>
<p>In domestic grades, differentials remained firm especially for Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James, which moved between 57-61 cents over WTI, within Wednesday's range.</p>
<p>Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire rose to trade at plus 40 cents, three cents above previous deals.</p>
<p>Midland/WTI was also attracting deals, done at 8 cts over WTI, and talked at steady ranges between 7-10 cts over WTI.</p>
<p>Heavy, sour crudes were slightly weaker hurt partly by Shell returning Mars crude to production after the storm.</p>
<p>West Texas Sour/Midland was four-five cents weaker at WTI minus $1.30/1.28 to WTI/Cushing.</p>
<p>The Nov WTI/Brent spread, which fell to 70-75 cents today, is expected to keep domestics in keen demand over imports.</p>
