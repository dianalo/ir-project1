<p>Hideki Irabu, the Japanese pitching sensation for the New York Yankees, is actually the biological son of an American, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Times quoted the man who raised Irabu, restaurant manager Ichiru Irabu, as saying that the 28-year-old baseball star was the son of his wife, Kazue, and an American man he declined to name.</p>
<p>The paper said there has been speculation throughout Japan that Irabu's father was an American serviceman, but the family had not spoken before about Irabu's parentage.</p>
<p>Ichiro Irabu told the Times that the subject was too sensitive for him to talk about at length, saying only that he became Hideki's stepfather soon after Hideki was born.</p>
<p>He declined to say whether the pitcher knew his real father or whether the man is alive, the article said.</p>
<p>Irabu made a sensational major-league debut for the Yankees Thursday, striking out nine batters in 6-2/3 innings in a victory over the Detroit Tigers before a big, festive Yankee Stadium crowd. He was scheduled to start Tuesday afternoon at Yankee Stadium against the Cleveland Indians.</p>
<p>The big right-hander, who owns a blazing fastball which he throws at varying speeds along with a baffling splitter and deceptive changeup, has grabbed headlines in a City Hall appearance with the mayor and a parking lot collision with the car of Yankee boss George Steinbrenner.</p>
<p>Irabu signed a four-year, $12.8 million contract with the Yankees after they struck a deal with the San Diego Padres, who had acquired his rights from Chiba Lotte of the Japanese Pacific League. He insisted he would play for no major-league team except the Yankees.</p>
