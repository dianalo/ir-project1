<p>The New Zealand share market closed flat on Monday after the top 40 index lost morning gains.</p>
<p>Brokers said it was a disappointing performance given Wall Street's 95-point gain on Friday but they said there was no particular reason for the afternoon weakness.</p>
<p>"There was no follow-through. It's more selective interest out there than interest across the board," said JB Were broker Luke Koekoek.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 capital index closed down 0.92 to 2276.61 on volume of NZ$51.1 million.  </p>
<p>Telecom was a key reason for the market turnaround, ending square at $6.53 against its intraday high of $6.60.</p>
<p>Brokers said it was disappointing given the fall in interest rates over the past few days. Any rise hits a selling wall.</p>
<p>Lion Nathan, which ended seven down at NZ$3.50, was also seen as a disappointment. Its result last week was supposed to have cleared the air, brokers said.</p>
<p>One leader to fare better was Brierley, which ended two ahead at $1.30, possibly benefiting from speculation about the Fairfax newspaper group and a good performance from other of its Australian investments.  </p>
<p>Fletcher Challenge Energy gained eight cents to NZ$4.32 after it announced a farm-out deal in Brunei which is seen improving production.</p>
<p>Others to outperform the market included retailers Hallenstein Glasson, up 13 to $2.25 and The Warehouse, up 11 to $3.86.</p>
<p>Property stocks were also well bid in response to the lower interest rate regime.</p>
