<p>Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro underwent successful surgery in the United States on Monday to correct a compression in her lower spinal column, the government said.</p>
<p>Doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore found an inflamation in her spinal column that, once treated, will free her of chronic pain in her back and one leg that has limited her movement, a government statement said.</p>
<p>"(Chamorro) is in good health and, according to her doctors, will be able to return to Nicaragua next week," it said.</p>
<p>Chamorro, 66, had complained of lower back pain since a trip to Taiwan in May, when pain forced her to go to Taipei University Hospital for an examination. She suffers from osteoporosis, a disease that weakens the bones, and has repeatedly flown to Washington for treatment. She is scheduled to step down in January after a term of nearly seven years.</p>
