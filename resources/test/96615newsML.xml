<p>Defence Secretary William Perry has ordered some 5,000 U.S. troops in Germany to go into Bosnia and they will begin moving shortly with tanks and helicopters to protect the removal of U.S. troops now in that country, the Army said on Friday.</p>
<p>In a statement from Heidelberg, Germany, the Army said the soldiers would go in by road and the equipment by rail from Schweinfurt.</p>
<p>They will be in position in Bosnia in about six weeks to cover the withdrawal of 15,000 U.S. peacekeeping troops.</p>
<p>The Pentagon had announced earlier that the cover force would go and that some troops would remain there until March. But Perry told hostile Republican senators in testimony on Thursday that the 5,000 troops were not designed as a vanguard for a new international force in Bosnia.</p>
<p>"The covering force will deploy with approximately 30 M-1A1 tanks, 100 Bradley Fighting Vehicles and 40 helicopters. Its combat capability is essential to insure that the withdrawal of currently-deployed U.S. assets is done safely and without interference," the Army statement said.</p>
<p>An Army officer in Germany told Reuters that the troops were expected to begin moving early next week.</p>
<p>At the Pentagon, defence officials said Perry signed the order on Thursday night and it was quickly transmitted to Germany.</p>
