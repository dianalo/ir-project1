<p>BE Semiconductors Industries NV (BESI) said on Tuesday the increase in orders in the first half of the year were not likely to have a substantional impact on third quarter results.</p>
<p>"The book-to-bill ratio for the first half of 1997 increased significantly and is above one, compared to 0.43 for the second half of 1996," BESI said. "Given our manufacturing time from order entry to delivery, the increases in orders in the first half of the year are not likely to substantially impact third quarter results," it said.</p>
<p>Earlier BESI reported net profits of 8.9 million guilders in the first half of 1997 compared to 23.8 million in the same period of 1996.</p>
