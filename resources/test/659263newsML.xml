<p>Prospects of a further drop in U.S. corn and wheat prices are expected to lure back Philippine buyers into the market next week, Manila grains traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>Wheat prices dropped on Thursday after the United States Department of Agriculture said 1997 U.S. winter wheat production would total 1.604 billion bushels, higher than analysts' estimates of 1.579 billion.</p>
<p>"Expect Philippine buyers to take advantage of price dips next week," said an executive in a Philippine mill.</p>
<p>He expected U.S. wheat prices to align soon with European and Canadian wheat prices. For hard wheat, these are $5 to $10 lower than U.S. prices at present, he added.</p>
<p>Philippine hog and poultry farmers were also likely to be in the market due to a local shortage.</p>
<p>"Corn is getting scarce," said an official in a Philippine poultry firm.</p>
<p>The country's main corn harvest is expected in the third quarter but agriculture officials said prospects of a dry spell due to "El Nino" weather patterns in the Pacific Ocean might affect production.</p>
<p>Livestock farmers have projected the Philippine corn shortage at one to two million tonnes this year.</p>
<p>Traders said they were waiting for an announcement from a group of Philippine hog raisers which sought price quotes recently for the supply of at least 25,000 tonnes of U.S. corn.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, rice, soybean and soymeal buyers were expected to remain on the sidelines due to ample supplies.  </p>
