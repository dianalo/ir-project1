<p>Bulgaria's National Veterinary Service (NVS) said on Tuesday an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the southeast had been contained and trade would resume in about three months.</p>
<p>"The ban on livestock trade will be lifted three months after the quarantine is over," NVS deputy director Andrei Kozarev told Reuters.</p>
<p>Bulgaria suspended livestock exports and trade two weeks ago in an effort to contain the outbreak in Malko Sharkovo, near the border with Turkey.</p>
<p>The quarantine will end 20 days after the last contaminated animal was slaughtered, which was on November 10, said Kozarev.</p>
<p>Last week Romania suspended livestock imports from its southern neighbour following the outbreak.</p>
