<p>Indonesian Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad has confirmed the government was studying the possibility of merging some state banks to improve competitiveness, the Bisnis Indonesia newspaper said on Friday.</p>
<p>Mar'ie said officials from the finance ministry and the central bank were looking into the possibility but declined to give details. "Our staff are studying the possibility. But please don't ask me how many banks would emerge at the end," Mar'ie was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The daily reported earlier that the government planned to merge its seven state-owned banks into four entities.</p>
<p>It said PT Bank Negara Indonesia, PT Bank Expor Impor Indonesia, PT Bank Dagang Negara and PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia would emerge from the consolidation.</p>
<p>The daily did not say which banks the other three state banks -- PT Bank Tabungan Negara, PT Bank Pembangunan Indonesia and PT Bank Bumi Daya -- would merge with.</p>
<p>Mar'ie declined to say when the study would be completed.</p>
<p>"For sure our staff are doing their exercises towards a merger. When it's completed we will announce it."</p>
<p>Financial markets have long anticipated the move. Brokers and dealers have said the government was planning to merge its state banks to make them more effective to face free trade agreements which will be implemented by 2003 under a plan prepared by the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
<p>Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are the current members of ASEAN. Burma, Laos and Cambodia are scheduled to join this year.</p>
