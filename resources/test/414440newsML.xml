<p>Slovenian shares eased 1.32 percent on Monday and traders said prices were likely to continue tracking lower until the preconditions for a return of foreigners to the fledgling market were in place.</p>
<p>"We're in a waiting period and there will be no major moves until banks announce how much money from abroad they will be able to handle over the new custodian accounts," said Goran Spasenic, a trader at brokerage BPH.</p>
<p>The Bank of Slovenia three weeks ago said international investors had to open a custody account at one of Slovenia's 14 fully licensed banks if they wanted to trade in Slovenian securities. Banks said the custodian account schemes were expected to be ready by the end of this week.</p>
<p>* The SBI index fell 18.84 points to 1,412.21.</p>
<p>* Issue A of drug firm Lek had the highest turnover, falling 2.39 percent to 27,400 tolars on volume of 1,053 shares.</p>
