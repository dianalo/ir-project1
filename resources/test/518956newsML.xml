<p>Australian shares opened mixed to slightly firmer on Thursday with investors mostly ignoring the Dow's strong gain which was led by tobacco stocks on news that massive litigation against the industry could be settled.</p>
<p>At 10.20 a.m. (0020 GMT), the All Ordinaries index was 1.7 points firmer at 2,408.1.</p>
<p>The June share price index was up two points at 2,404 and at a 4.1 point discount to the underlying index.</p>
<p>Early turnover was boosted by large parcels in retail property trusts, Gandel Retail Trust and Countrywide Retail Trust.</p>
<p>About 18 million Countrywide units were put through the market by broker Macquarie Equities, while 27 million Gandel units were crossed by SBC Warburg at 90 cents (US$0.63) a unit.</p>
<p>"It is likely the Countrywide stock is units that have been held in escrow by a vendor. With Gandel it's not the institutions, the other thing I suspect is maybe the Gandel family," a dealer at a Sydney-based brokerage said.</p>
<p>Apart from the two retail trusts, the most active issues were blue chip resource stock, the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP) and Australia's largest bank, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB). BHP was steady, while NAB was firmer.</p>
<p>Anglo-Australian drug research and diagnostic group Cortecs International Ltd was the star early, its shares rocketing 14 percent to nearly match the performance of its London stock which climbed 19 percent on Wednesday following a positive broker report.</p>
<p>The report said that Cortecs stock could double in price if the company announces a positive trial of a new drug to treat the bone-wasting disease, osteoporosis.</p>
<p>Industrial issues were favoured over resource in early trade, with mining and oil and gas stocks hit by weaker commodity prices on offshore markets on Wednesday.</p>
