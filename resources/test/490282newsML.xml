<p>Demand was good but not so strong as at the last sale on March 24 at Monday's tea auction in London.</p>
<p>The best price realised was for a Kenya PD at 178 pence compared with 195 for a Burundi PD.</p>
<p>Bright East Africans came to a selective market with prices irregular and following quantity. Mediums met good competition at fully firm to often dearer rates.</p>
<p>The offshore sector saw better liqouring Kenyas and Zimbabwes sell well at firm to dearer levels but others were irregular and tended lower.</p>
