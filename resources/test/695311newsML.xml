<p>Trouble with new junk bonds issues was the main focus of attention on Monday, as the U.S. corporate bond market closed largely unchanged on a slow day of trading, market players said.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, news leaked out that underwriters were restructuring junk bond deals and increasing price talk levels. Gridlock, caused by a traffic jam of new issues, was cited as the main reason for the unfriendly conditions.</p>
<p>Dissatisfied with the current market, Boyd Gaming Corp decided to pull its $250 million junk bond offering via Salomon Brothers.  </p>
<p>The company said it planned to relaunch the offering at a later date when pricing conditions improved.</p>
<p>West Coast Entertainment also increased price talk on its $110 million issue (B2/B) to 11 percent to 11 1/4 percent from 10 5/8 to 10 7/8 due to weakened investor demand, sources said.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse First Boston, which was expected to price the offering last Friday, was still working with investors on Monday afternoon, they added.</p>
<p>Two other deals were restructured to accommodate the more treacherous market:  </p>
<p>-Adelphia Communications Corp and Smith Barney Inc changed the company's $300 million two-part offering to $150 million in eight-year bonds and $150 million in cash-pay exchangeable preferred stock. Originally, the company hoped to sell 10-year bonds and exchangeable preferred stock that paid-in-kind.</p>
<p>-Glasstech Inc was rumored to have shortened the maturity of $85 million offering to eight-years from 10-years as well as to have added an equity kicker to the deal in the form of warrants. Officials at lead underwriter CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Corp declined to comment.  </p>
<p>Since last week, the onslaught of new issues, coupled with weakness in the Treasury and stock markets, has pushed prices of outstanding junk bonds lower.</p>
<p>The price component of weekly returns declined 0.11 percent last week, according to a Salamon Brothers report.</p>
<p>Martin Fridson, head of high-yield bond strategy at Merril Lynch &amp; Co, said it was natural for the high-yield market to experience such price swings as issuers crowd to market in order to tap favorable rates.</p>
<p>Junk bond prices were unchanged in modest trading on Monday.  </p>
<p>High-grade bond spreads tracked Treasuries on Monday on similarly sluggish trading volume.</p>
<p>"The (secondary) market is going to be dead before the holiday, unless the (Federal Open Market Committee) decides to do something," said one investment-grade bond trader.</p>
<p>He said even the price of last week's RJR Nabisco bond deal, which was recently freed to trade, was unchanged from its when-issued level.</p>
<p>In other markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 14.93 points to close at 7672.79.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries retraced recent gains on Monday as strong housing sales and a improved Chicago purchasing managers' survey put pressure on the market.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury dropped 17/32 to close at 97-30/32, yielding 6.79 percent.</p>
