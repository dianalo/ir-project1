<p>Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd has formed a property agency with shareholders of a Hong Kong-based property agent LandPower International Property Agency Ltd, Cheung Kong's deputy managing director H.L. Kam said on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Hong Kong Property, which employs about 300 sales agents, runs 86 service centres in Hong Kong including 26 information service centres at Park'N Shop Ltd supermarkets owned by Cheung Kong associate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.</p>
<p>The service centres were mostly leased, including some from Cheung Kong, Choi said. The agency has installed a HK$10 million computerised customer information service.</p>
<p>"Our (Cheung Kong's) investment in Hong Kong Property is a particularly meaningful investment, as it fits very well with our main businesses," said Kam, also chairman of Hong Kong Property. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6590</p>
