<text>
<p>U.S. natural gas producers and consumers expressed concern Friday about the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's approval this week of a major pipeline company rate agreement which avoided the commission's standard rate structure.</p>
<p>The FERC Wednesday backed a rate settlement between Tenneco Inc's Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co and its shippers, resolving several issues on cost of service and rate designs.</p>
<p>While FERC has permitted some pipelines to negotiate rates with individual shippers, this was the first time it approved a broad settlement deviating from the standard rate design.</p>
