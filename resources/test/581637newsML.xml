<p>Owen Nolan of the San Jose Sharks had a goal and an assist as Canada beat Olympic champions Sweden 2-1 on Wednesday to win the world ice hockey title.</p>
<p>The victory capped a gritty comeback by the Canadians after they had lost the first game of the best-of-three final on Sunday. It was their 21st world title but only their second in the past 35 years.</p>
<p>"We knew we were going to win and they were hoping," said Canadian coach Andy Murray. "I told our players just before the game that right now the Swedes are sitting in their dressing room hoping we're going to play a bad game, hoping that Sean Burke's going to have a bad day, that Owen Nolan isn't going to score.</p>
<p>"There's a difference between knowing and hoping and we knew."</p>
<p>The win ended a frustrating string of second-place finishes for Canada that stretched back to the 1994 Olympics, won by Sweden in an overtime shootout.</p>
<p>Despite running into penalty problems in their earlier clashes with the Swedes, Canada continued to employ their familiar aggressive, hard-hitting style.</p>
<p>They controlled the pace of the contest from the opening faceoff and were indebted to some rock solid goaltending by Hartford Whalers' Sean Burke.</p>
<p>Burke, who started every game in the Canadian net, collected the gold that had eluded him at the 1989 and 1991 world championships when the team returned home with silver.</p>
<p>"I've played a lot of international tournaments and never won a gold and this is the biggest thrill of my career," said Burke. "I know how the Swedes are feeling, they're sitting over their feeling like they didn't accomplish anything.</p>
<p>"This is what it's all about...winning is everything."</p>
<p>Nolan, who was suspended for a game for his part in a brawl against the Czech Republic, finally made his presence felt on the scoresheet as well, setting up the opening goal and scoring the second.</p>
<p>"We were on a mission, said Nolan. "I can't describe the effort we put in tonight...I play to win and if that means hitting someone I'm going to do it."</p>
<p>Dean Evason, the only non-NHL player on the Canadian roster, netted the only goal of the first period when he hammered home a loose puck from the the side of the Sweden net after goaltender Tommy Salo failed to control the rebound from a shot by Nolan.</p>
<p>"When I join this team it was my goal to get to the world championships," said Evason, who played 12 years in the NHL before this season. "I didn't really think it was realistic because they usually use all current NHL players.</p>
<p>"To get this opportunity and to wear the captain C for the Canadian team and be the world champs is unbelievable."</p>
<p>Nolan added the second early in the second period when New York Islanders' Travis Green threaded a perfect pass through a crowd in the slot.</p>
<p>With Salo pulled in favour of the extra attacker, Michael Nylander ruined Burke's shutout bid when he snapped a wrist shot in off the far post, converting the powerplay opportunity with less than two minutes to play.</p>
<p>The gold medal restored some of Canada's battered pride and re-established their international credibility ahead of the Nagano Olympics where professionals will take part for the first time.</p>
<p>They suffered a heartbreaking last-second loss to the Czech Republic in last year's final in Vienna and were beaten by the United States in the inaugural World Cup last September.</p>
