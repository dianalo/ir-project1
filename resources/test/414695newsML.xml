<p>The high sulphur fuel oil market was slightly firmer on Monday as news of some scheduled refinery maintenance turnarounds boost sentiment, traders said.</p>
<p>But they said the market is still long on the continued absence of Chinese playeras and ample supplies, traders said.</p>
<p>A major sold 20,000 tonnes of 180-cst grade at $98 per tonne for lifting March 26-30, traders said.</p>
<p>An independent was later heard bidding at $102 per tonne for March 22-26 lifting but could not find sellers.</p>
<p>"Some people are trying to push up prices," said one trader.</p>
<p>"There are still quite enough supplies, but we are entering the March turnaround season and the current big supply surplus should come down gradually," said one independent.</p>
<p>Two Singapore refineries -- Mobil and Singapore Refinery Co -- are scheduled to have maintenance turnarounds in March.</p>
<p>Another trader said China, which has covered its requirements for the fisrt half of March, appeared to start making some enquiries.</p>
<p>"They are not active, bidding at very low prices," the trader said.</p>
<p>Fuel oil swaps remained weak.  March and April swaps were bid at $98 and $96.25 respectively, compared with Friday's $97.00/$98.00 and $96.00/$97.00.</p>
<p>The bunker market was quiet, with sellers speculating the cargo market might go up and unwilling to offer, traders said.</p>
