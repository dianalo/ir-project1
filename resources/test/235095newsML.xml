<p>NASA's first Mars rover was on the road to the Red Planet after roaring away from its Florida launch pad early on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Mars Pathfinder probe lit up the cold Florida night with a brilliant trail of flame at 1:58 a.m. EST (0658 GMT) as it blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Station atop a McDonnell Douglas Corp. Delta 2 rocket.</p>
<p>Observers at Cape Canaveral watched the 13-storey rocket appear to pass through the crescent moon as it arced toward deep space.</p>
<p>The Delta 2 carried the probe on the first leg of its 310 million mile (500 million km), seven-month trek to Mars. The spacecraft separated from the third stage of the rocket about 75 minutes after blastoff, 500 miles (800 km) above Hawaii.</p>
<p>"The spacecraft is now on its way to Mars," NASA launch commentator George Diller said, as ground controllers broke into applause.</p>
<p>The launch, originally scheduled for Dec. 2, was delayed first by stormy weather and then by a last-minute ground computer glitch. The rocket's countdown on Wednesday went flawlessly and the weather did not interfere.</p>
<p>One problem cropped up soon after launch. Project officials said a sun sensor, part of the spacecraft's pointing mechanism, was not working properly. They hoped to fix the device later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mars Pathfinder is the second in a new wave of unmanned robotic explorers that NASA intends to dispatch to Earth's planetary neighbour over the next decade.</p>
<p>Pathfinder is to overtake the Global Surveyor, NASA's first Mars probe of the year, launched Nov. 7, and arrive at the planet on July 4, 1997.</p>
<p>If all goes according to plan, the $196 million probe will plunge through the thin Martian atmosphere, slow by parachute and bounce to a safe landing, protected by giant air bags. In just five minutes, the lander will brake from 17,000 mph (43,500 km/hr) to a touchdown speed of 30 mph (48 km/hr).</p>
<p>The Pathfinder's pyramid-shaped lander carries a six-wheeled rover the size of an office laser printer, called Sojourner. It will roam tens of yards (metres) from the landing station, beaming back pictures of the surface and sniffing out the composition of rocks.</p>
<p>"I don't know what to expect but we know that there probably won't be any little green people," Donna Shirley, the deputy head of NASA's Mars exploration effort, said. "There might be some unexpected findings in terms of the mineralogy and the terrain."</p>
<p>The rover will be driven by remote control by a team of technicians at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.</p>
<p>The drivers will steer the solar-powered vehicle across the rock strewn landscape using virtual reality goggles linked to cameras on the rover and landing station.</p>
<p>Pictures and weather reports from the Martian surface will appear daily on the Internet, creating a "virtual presence" on the planet for computer users world-wide, NASA Administrator Dan Goldin said.</p>
<p>And for those not content with just computer images, toy manufacturer Mattel will offer a "Hot Wheels" toy version of the Sojourner rover by the time the real thing arrives at Mars.</p>
<p>"It's really cool," said Shirley. "The little wheels articulate just like the real thing."</p>
