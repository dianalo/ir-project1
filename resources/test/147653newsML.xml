<p>A wake will be held beginning Wednesday evening for 45-year-old James Augenthaler, formerly of Cambridge Partners and CS First Boston, who died Monday morning.</p>

<p>"Jim Augenthaler was one of the finest and most decent human beings who ever walked through the canyons of Wall Street," Mike Cirasella, a long time co-worker, said. "His many friends in the municipal industry will attest to Jim's professionalism and integrity, which were beyond reproach. His smile, laughter, story telling and companionship will be dearly missed by all of us."</p>
<p>Augenthaler is survived by his wife, Debra, and two children, Bobby and Kathleen, from a previous marriage.</p>
<p>A wake will be held Wednesday evening from seven p.m. to nine p.m. at Fairchild Sons funeral home on Northern Boulevard in Manhasset. Thursday hours are from three p.m. to five p.m. and seven to nine p.m.</p>
<p>Funeral services will begin Friday at 10:30 a.m. at St. Mary's Church in Manhasset, Long Island, N.Y.</p>
