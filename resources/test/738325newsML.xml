<p>Tiger Woods looked to have lost all chance of capturing the British Open title when he took a quadruple bogey eight on the 10th hole at Royal Troon in the second round on Friday.</p>
<p>Northern Irishman Darren Clarke sprinted into a clear lead as titleholder Tom Lehman, who shot an opening 74, faded when he took a triple-bogey seven at the second which included a two-shot penalty for not replacing his marker on the green.</p>
<p>World number one Woods laboured on the early greens, where he made three-putt bogeys at the third and fifth holes, and had a disastrous experience on the 438-yard 10th.</p>
<p>His drive was fine but his second went through the green into an almost unplayable lie in a bush. He tried to hack out but moved the ball only three inches and his fourth flew almost into another bush.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old Masters champion then pitched over the green, chipped back on and two-putted for an eight.</p>
<p>Woods had struggled earlier despite conditions perfect for good scoring, his two bogeys cancelling out birdies on the two long holes.</p>
<p>He three-putted both greens, missing second putts of three feet at the third and four feet on the fifth.</p>
<p>Lehman moved his ball marker as it was in the line of a playing partner's putt and did not move it back when it was his turn, an elementary error calling for a two-shot penalty.</p>
<p>But he recovered with birdies at the fourth, fifth and eighth to stay alive at three over par.</p>
<p>The burly Clarke raced to a four-under front nine of 32 to reach eight under for the tournament and stayed that way through the 14th.</p>
<p>Clarke, 28, who is certain to make his Ryder Cup debut for Europe against the United States at Valderrama in September, was in sizzling form.</p>
<p>The joint overnight leader birdied the first two holes from 12 and 11 feet and the long fourth after reaching the green in two and two-putting.</p>
<p>He bogeyed the short fifth and eighth holes after missing the green on the right side at the fifth and hitting into a bunker on eight.</p>
<p>But the 577-yard sixth provided another birdie, his second stopping 25 yards short of the green from where he putted up to six feet and holed.</p>
<p>He holed from 12 and 15 feet for birdies at the seventh and ninth, dropped one at the 10th and birdied the 14th where he holed from off the green.</p>
<p>Jesper Parnevik, the U.S.-based Swede who was second in the 1994 Open at Turnberry, moved up to second here after following on from his fine finish on Thursday.</p>
<p>He birdied the last three holes then for a 70 and after a bogey five at the first on Friday he picked up five shots by the 11th to stand three strokes behind Clarke.</p>
<p>The Swede's surge included an eagle at the fourth hole.</p>
<p>Co-overnight leader Jim Furyk dropped back after a bogey six at the fourth, a wasted opportunity. He drove into a bunker, could only pitch out and missed the green with his third shot.</p>
<p>The American dropped another at the seventh but got one back at the 126-yard Postage Stamp eighth with a two as his playing partner, Dennis Edlund of Sweden, made a hole in one.</p>
<p>Another Swede, amateur Daniel Olsson, then aced the 210-yard fifth with a five iron to become the third player from his country to score an ace this week. Pierre Fulke did so at the 14th on Thursday.</p>
