<p>Five policemen, including a local police chief, were killed in an ambush by armed men in the northern Philippines, a report reaching the police regional headquarters on Friday said.</p>
<p>The report said Police Inspector Manuel Alop, Palauig town's chief of police, and four other policemen were fired at by still unidentified men on Wednesday afternoon along a dirt road in Zambales province, 140 km (87 miles) north of Manila.</p>
<p>Two civilians, who were hitching a ride inside the police jeep, were also killed in the ambush.</p>
<p>The policemen were on their way to investigate a crime.</p>
<p>Police investigators said they believed the ambush was the work of local communist rebels. But no one so far has claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
<p>The Philippine government is holding peace negotiations with the leaders of the local communist party in Utrecht in the Netherlands to end the 28-year insurgency. The peace talks will resume next month.</p>
