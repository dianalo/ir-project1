<p>Heavy torrential rains in southern Taiwan since June 30 have taken four lives and caused T$1.5 billion in farms and crops damages, Council of Agriculture officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"The (farms) losses have reached T$1.5 billion," a council official said by telephone.</p>
<p>The torrential rains had swept through most of the southern island and flooded many farmlands, with southern counties of Tainan and Yunlin being hardest hit.</p>
<p>Four people were killed and two othere were missing because of the rains, the official said.</p>
<p>Taiwan's retail fruits and vegetable prices are expected to rise by about 15 percent later this week as the result of the farm damages, he said.</p>
<p>The council has urged local governments to offer emergency assistance to farmers who had suffered rain-related losses.</p>
<p>The rains also flooded the construction sites in the southern Tainan Science-Based Park, where major Taiwan's electronic firms, including United Microelectronics and Taiwan Semiconductor, are planning to build multi-billion-dollar semiconductor projects, local media said.</p>
<p>The exact damages were not immediately known.</p>
