<p>Mexico crude ports Pajaritos and Dos Bocas were closed Thursday because of strong winds and high waves, port officials told Reuters.</p>
<p>Pajaritos, under the jurisdiction of Coatzacoalcos port in Veracruz state, was shut at 0850 local/1450 GMT, and Dos Bocas in Tabasco state was closed at 0925 local, the officials said.  </p>
<p>At Pajaritos, winds were clocked at between 50 and 60 km per hour from the northwest, while Dos Bocas winds were from the north at 40 to 50 km per hour, Communications and Transport Ministry said in a 1000 local/1800 GMT meteorological update.</p>
<p>Mexico's largest shipping terminal, Cayo Arcas in Campeche state, was reported open by the ministry with wind speeds of between 20 and 30 km per hour.</p>
<p>The cold front is expected to move south and southeast toward the Yucatan peninsula within the next 12 hours, the ministry said.</p>
<p>State-owned oil and gas monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) has said Cayo Arcas ships an average 600,000 crude oil barrels per day (bpd), Pajaritos exports 400,000 bpd and Dos Bocas ships 300,000 bpd.</p>
