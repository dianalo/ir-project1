<p>Treasurer Winston Peters said on Thursday tax cuts beyond 1998 would depend on economic and fiscal conditions.</p>
<p>"We can look forward to legislated tax cuts in July 1998," Peters said in his Budget speech, referring to NZ$1.1 billion of cuts already in law and due to take effect on July 1, 1998.</p>
<p>"Beyond 1998, economic and fiscal conditions permitting, the government will plan for futher tax reductions," Peters said.</p>
<p>But he said the results of a referendum on compulsory superannuation to be held in September "will have a bearing on the shape and form of these future tax reductions".  </p>
