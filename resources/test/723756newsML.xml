<p>Southeast Asian currencies were thrown into a tailspin on Friday after the Philippines' shock move to effectively devalue the peso after repeated denials of such a step earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The Philippines Central Bank said at the start of trading on Friday it would allow the peso to trade in a wider range against the U.S. dollar, with immediate effect.</p>
<p>Dealers saw the move as the second de facto devaluation of an Asian currency in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>The peso sank over 11 percent to 29.450 to the dollar in immediate reaction to the news, before the Bankers Association of the Philippines halted peso-dollar trades for the day.</p>
<p>Dealers said the news, though widely seen an inevitable, did little to restore the already fragile confidence of investors and foreign fund managers in the region.</p>
<p>"They had very little choice anyway. It was just a matter of time, especially if all the stronger economies in this region are suffering. What else can they do," a Singapore dealer said.</p>
<p>In Thailand, the baht came in for another bashing just over a week after its own de facto devaluation, as the peso news spurred heavy demand for the dollar.</p>
<p>"It has definitely been hurt by the Philippine peso attacks. Speculators are focusing on both the Philippine and Thai currencies," a dealer at a Thai bank in Bangkok said.</p>
<p>The baht fell to a new low of 29.750 to the dollar in early trade against 29.100/29.200 late on Thursday. It was quoted at 29.900/29.950 in the onshore market and 29.350/29.450 offshore at 0415 GMT.</p>
<p>"We saw some bids for dollars at around 30.000 baht this morning," another Bangkok dealer said.</p>
<p>But dealers said the baht's weakness was contained by central bank measures, implemented when the currency came under speculative attack in mid-May, to block access to baht offshore.</p>
<p>"Offshore is still lingering behind because we don't have funds to push it with. It's difficult to push something you don't have the liquidity in," the Singapore dealer said.</p>
<p>But he added that the baht was looking weak. "People here are still seeing 32-35 (baht/dollar) levels whereas domestic is looking at 30-32," he said.</p>
<p>A Thai dealer said the baht weakness could also be attributed to high carried over commercial demand for dollars that was unmatched at the Thursday close.</p>
<p>Dealers said they had not detected any signs the Thai central bank had stepped in to defend the baht.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, the rupiah stopped sliding but remained weak as players began to re-evaluate the morning's developments.</p>
<p>"We see some dollar selling. I think offshore operators are taking profits as there is no problem with the rupiah," a European bank dealer in Jakarta said.</p>
<p>He said selling interest also seemed to be emerging in the swap market, which rose sharply on spillover from the peso.</p>
<p>"Some operators think we are in the same region, so it's better to cover first before anything happens, causing spot rupiah rates to decline and swaps to rise," another said.</p>
<p>"But after realising Indonesia has different economic fundamentals, they started to reverse positions," he said.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was at around 2,435.5/36.5 at 0415 GMT against an early low of 2,437.0. It opened at 2,432.5/33.5.</p>
<p>The Malaysian ringgit also came under pressure but dealers said its downside was limited by a market already long dollars and signs of the central bank's presence.</p>
<p>Dealers said the ringgit was pushed down to a low of 2.4980 against the dollar but Bank Negara Malaysia was calling banks to check rates on the run up to that level.</p>
<p>"They've been around the whole day but they don't need to (act). Nobody's doing anything," the Singapore dealer said.</p>
<p>He said the ringgit's downside would be limited to 2.5050 to the dollar.</p>
<p>Further south, the Singapore dollar remained a relative island of calm, firming slightly as it ordinarily does on any signs of regional instability.</p>
<p>"There's not much interest on the dollar/Sing. It strengthened because when there's a crisis in the region, people will park their funds in Singapore," a dealer said.</p>
<p>But he added that there was little indication the Singapore dollar could strengthen beyond the 1.4280/1.4300 level to the U.S. dollar during the Asian session.</p>
