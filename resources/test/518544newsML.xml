<p>Four Italian coastguard vessels left this southeastern Italian port on Thursday to patrol Albanian waters in an attempt to dissuade illegal emigrants from trying to cross the Adriatic.</p>
<p>They will deploy inside Albanian waters off the port of Durres, where four more vessels will join them in the next few days, coastguard officials said.</p>
<p>A similar operation is being planned for the southern Albanian port of Vlore, in the hands of rebels since an armed insurrection erupted in Albania in late February.</p>
<p>The patrols, and aerial surveillance of the narrow Strait of Otranto between Albania and Italy, have been established under a bilateral agreement between the countries.</p>
<p>Italy is leading a multinational force of up to 6,000 troops which began deploying in Albania this week to assist in a relief mission to the impoverished state.</p>
<p>Its eagerness to lead the mission, a major foreign policy test, has been encouraged in part by a desire to stem a flow of illegal Albanian immigrants to Italy since Stalinist rule in the Balkan state collapsed in 1991.</p>
<p>Around 13,000 Albanians arrived in March in a fleet of overcrowded boats.</p>
<p>Albanian officials say as many as 83 Albanians drowned on March 28 when a boat from Vlore collided with an Italian corvette trying to turn the vessel back.</p>
<p>Italian Navy chief of staff Admiral Angelo Mariani said in a message to the departing 48 coastguards on Thursday that their task was "to exercise in depth control of the phenomenon of clandestine immigration".</p>
<p>The coastguards will also seek to halt smuggling from Albania to Italy, which often involves drugs, and help to re-establish normal port activities in Durres and Vlore.</p>
