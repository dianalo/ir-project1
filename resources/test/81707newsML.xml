<p>Bellwether Exploration Co said initial production from Cove McPac Gas Unit No. 1 Well drilled in the Cover Field on Matagorda Block 487-L, offshore Texas, is expected by December, following connection to the Cove Field production platform.</p>
<p>The company said the platform is currently averaging almost 10 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, up from 1.5 million cubic feet per day prior to Bellwether's five-well workover program completed in April 1996.  </p>
<p>Bellwether owns a 42 percent working interest in the Cove-McPac Gas Unit. Other owners include Santa Fe Energy Resources Inc with 25 percent, Louisiana Land and Exploration Co with 16 percent,  3DX Technologies Inc with 7 percent,  Lamar Oil &amp; Gas Inc with 6 percent, and Whiting Petroleum Corp and an affiliated partnership with 4 precent.</p>
<p>Bellwether said the Cove McPac Gas-1 tested 2.6 million cubic feet of natural gas and 192 barrels of water per day from its lower zone and 2.1 million cubic feet of natural gas and 144 barrels of water per day from its upper zone.</p>
<p>The water produced by both sands is completion fluids and not formation waters, Bellwether said, adding it expects these natural gas production rates to increase significantly once completion fluids are recovered.</p>
<p>The company said it is moving the rig to drill the State Lease 57686 No. 12 Well, in which it owns a 90 percent working interest with Lamar Oil &amp; Gas owning the remaining 10 percent.</p>
