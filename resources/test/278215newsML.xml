<p>U.S. spot fuel oil prices were mixed Thursday in light, holiday trade, with New York grades pressured by softer NYMEX futures and forecasts for milder weather, while Gulf Coast values held relatively steady.</p>
<p>"It's too early to get too bearish, but if we don't get (cold) weather by mid-January, you'll see a lot more bears," said one East Coast utility buyer.</p>
<p>New York Harbor 0.3 percent high pour slipped almost $1.00 a barrel to $21.75-22.00 on reports a New York utility paid $22.15 this week for 100,000 barrels of prompt HP (delivered). Traders said mid-Jan HP was offered in the $22.65-75 range.  </p>
<p>NYH one percent fell 50 cents to $21.00-25, with January one percent paper down 75 cents to $20.65-75. February one percent paper was talked in the $20.25-50 range.</p>
<p>High sulphurs in New York also lost ground, with three percent pegged 25-50 cents lower at $16 or under.</p>
<p>U.S. Gulf Coast one percent held relatively steady at $18.50-75, while three percent edged up slightly to $15.75-16.00. January three pct paper also gained modestly to the $16.75 area.</p>
<p>New York city gate gas prices tumbled 20-25 cents to the $3.90s/mmBtu versus NYH one percent resid at a $3.35/mmBtu equivalent. Early January gas in New York was quoted in the $4.30s, with January baseload gas pegged in the $4.70s. NYH January resid paper was at a $3.29/mmBtu equivalent.</p>
