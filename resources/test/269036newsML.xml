<p>Nasser Hussain's third test century led England to safety on the third day of the inaugural test against Zimbabwe at Queen's Club on Friday.</p>
<p>Replying to Zimbabwe's 376 the touring team had reached 306 for four at the close, trailing by a mere 70 runs with two days remaining.</p>
<p>Hussain was dropped at short leg off the first ball he faced and punished Zimbabwe's lapse to the full. He reached his hundred in the penultimate over of the day and at the close was 101 not out from 244 balls with 13 fours.</p>
<p>Hussain received solid support from Alec Stewart (48) and John Crawley (51 not out) as all the Zimbabwean bowlers with the exception of leg spinner Paul Strang toiled on a placid pitch.</p>
<p>The sole wicket before lunch came from paceman Henry Olonga who trapped Nick Knight lbw for 56 with a cleverly disguised slower ball.</p>
<p>Otherwise the only real tricky patch England endured came when Strang picked up two quick wickets in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Alec Stewart was unfortunate to be given out lbw on the front foot, sweeping, but Graham Thorpe was the victim of a classic piece of leg spin bowling.</p>
<p>Thorpe was beaten by Strang's flight and, having failed to pick the googly, was well caught by Zimbabwe skipper Alistair Campbell at first slip for 13.</p>
<p>Hussain and Crawley quickly slammed the door on any thoughts of a collapse and have so far added 126 for the fifth wicket. Crawley reached his 50 from 145 balls with seven fours.</p>
<p>Having been on the back foot for most of the first three days, England could yet be in a position to control the game if they can claim a first innings lead of 150.</p>
