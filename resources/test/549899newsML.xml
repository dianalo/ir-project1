<p>U.S. envoy Bill Richardson said on Wednesday Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila would meet on Friday on a South African navy vessel.  </p>
<p>"The meeting will take place on Friday on a South African ship. The ship will be sailing from Libreville into international waters," said Richardson after talks with Mobutu.</p>
<p>"...Hopefully it will lead to peace in Zaire," the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said. He added several African leaders and U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun would be present on the South African ship for the talks.</p>
<p>The meeting would be the first face-to-face talks between the ailing Zairean president and Kabila, whose rebels have seized more than half of Zaire since October and are advancing on Kinshasa.</p>
