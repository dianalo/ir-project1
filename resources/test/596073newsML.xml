<p>South Korean stocks opened higher on Monday, led by a rally of export industries, but brokers saw selling increasing when the index touches the 720-point level.</p>
<p>Buying in exporter shares was based on hopes that the Japanese yen's recent gains against the U.S. dollar would help boost competitiveness of South Korean exporters.</p>
<p>The composite index was up 10.13 points, or 1.43 percent, to 716.38 points after the first 25 minutes of trading.</p>
<p>"Gains are across the board, but many blue chips that rose sharply last week will face profit-taking selling later today," said Chang Kun-woo of Daishin Securities.</p>
