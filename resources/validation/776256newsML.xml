<p>Breaking out of a regional market and expanding internationally are the main tasks facing newly-formed New Century Energies, its chairman and CEO Bill Helton said Monday in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;A regional utility is a thing of the past,&quot; Helton told Reuters, referring to the scramble for market share in the rapidly deregulating U.S. electricity industry.</p>
<p>&quot;The winning companies have got to become national. And the regulatory environment (at home) is making it more difficult to compete for investor dollars. You have to have a global presence.&quot;</p>
<p>Helton was in New York to watch his company's debut on the New York Stock Exchange, where it opened at $41 5/8 a share and ended its first day at $42 7/8.</p>
<p>The company was forged in a merger agreed in August, 1995 between Denver-based Public Service Co of Colorado (PSCO), which dominates Colorado's power market, and Southwestern Public Service Co (SPS) in Amarillo, Texas.</p>
<p>New Century Energies, with combined assets of $6.6 billion and $3.1 billion in operating revenue, serves 1.5 million electricity customers in Colorado, the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, and parts of New Mexico, Kansas, and Wyoming.</p>
<p>It also has nearly a million natural gas customers through SPS, which remains one of its main operating units.</p>
<p>Helton said the company is forecasting two percent annual growth in domestic revenue for the next few years in its traditional service territories, with growth especially strong in the Denver area, where he cited a &quot;booming&quot; economy.</p>
<p>New Century's electricity sales in 1996 totaled 47.4 million megawatt hours (MWh), the main contribution to a net income of $272.3 million in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to accelerate this growth through customer choice from about 2001, as customer choice becomes available,&quot; Helton said, referring to the six states currently served by New Century Energies.</p>
<p>Deregulation will prove tricky for a company straddling so many state borders. Helton said some degree of federal legislation therefore would be desirable to avoid a patchwork of rules resulting in a bumpy interstate playing field.</p>
<p>Of the states New Century Energies currently serves, Helton said Texas is closest to letting customers select their power provider, and predicted approval of a final plan when the Texas legislature next convenes in 1999.</p>
<p>Plans to open the retail market have also been submitted in New Mexico, and New Century plans to hand its own recommendation to the Colorado legislature soon, Helton said.</p>
<p>In the international arena, Helton said the company is looking to expand in South America and Middle Asia, where they are evaluating possible contracts to operate local power systems, especially in Argentina and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Helton said taking equity stakes in power facilities in these countries was possible but not before 1998.</p>
<p>New Century Energies took its first step offshore via PSCO in February, 1997, when it formed a 50-50 partnership with American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio, to buy Yorkshire Electricity Group Plc in Britain.</p>
<p>Yorkshire, in east-central England, has two million customers and assets valued at about $2.4 billion.</p>
<p>The Yorkshire venture was hit this year with a $222 million windfall tax. Helton, who said he hopes this is a one-time tax, said New Century's $111 million share of the tax will be declared an extraordinary item this year and paid off in two installments by December, 1998.</p>
<p>Helton said further opportunities for growth in the domestic market included strategic alliances, partnerships and mergers.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to have an alliance by this fall but certainly not another merger,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>To accommodate anticipated growth in power demand, New Century Energies plans to add 200 MW next spring to its existing 8,000 MW of generating capacity.</p>
<p>It is also planning to build a 345 kilovolt transmission line, with a 400 MW capacity, which will be the first main tie between PSCO's and SPS's service territories.</p>
