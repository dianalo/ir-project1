<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won a bruising battle with parliament to cut this year's budget, but economists, investors and business executives are not convinced it can revive the flagging economy.</p>
<p>Parliament Wednesday approved a budget for 1997 of just under 190 billion shekels ($58.5 billion), including about 7 billion shekels ($2.15 billion) in spending cuts, higher taxes and higher fees. The Treasury said cuts made up about 4.7 billion shekels ($1.45 billion) of the total.</p>
<p>Analysts and business executives said they were disappointed with the extent of tax rises and other revenue-raising measures, which took the place of genuine budget cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;I see this budget more like a muddling through. There's no real message of reform, such as closing redundant offices. It's all general budget cutting,&quot; said Jonathan Katz, chief economist for Solid Finance Markets.</p>
<p>&quot;In my opinion the mix of higher taxes and lower spending cuts didn't help -- it was not as good as expected -- but the reductions are still big,&quot; said Gidi Halpern of Meitav Investments and Securities. &quot;The people we're in touch with in the Treasury are very optimistic.&quot;</p>
<p>The budget met strong opposition in Parliament, which led the Treasury to back down on plans to cut child allowances and impose fees for doctors' visits.</p>
<p>Instead, taxes on gasoline and cigarettes were raised, and income tax brackets will not be adjusted for inflation, which will effectively raise tax rates.</p>
<p>Analysts doubt that higher taxes will hurt Netanyahu politicially. But, they say, if he fails to deliver on his vows to undertake wide-ranging privatisation and liberalisation measures, confidence in his economic policy will suffer.</p>
<p>&quot;Other than rhetoric, we've seen very little,&quot; said Katz. &quot;If by the end of the first quarter, we don't see big sales of government companies, people will assume you can't count on them to do anything.&quot;</p>
<p>For now, however, the big question for Israeli business is whether the cuts will be enough to move the Bank of Israel to lower short-term interest rates and bring about a depreciation of the shekel.</p>
<p>In Israel's export-driven economy, a depreciation is widely seen as the means of sparking economic growth. Gross domestic product growth slowed to an estimated 4.4 percent in 1996 and is expected to slow to 4 percent this year.</p>
<p>But analysts were divided about whether a real interest rate cut is in the works.</p>
<p>&quot;With this budget it is hard to see a reduction of interest rates and without that the exchange rate situation will not improve,&quot; said Michael Strauss, chairman of Strauss Dairies, one of Israel's biggest food companies.</p>
