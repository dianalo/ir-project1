<title>CHINA: Shanghai T-bill repo rates end down, spots up.</title>
<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates end down, spots up.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-04-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mostly down on Tuesday due to falls on the domestic A share markets, traders said.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most active seven-day contract fell slightly to 8.88 percent from 9.00 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>Total turnover of the six-contract market fell to 5.8 million lots from 6.6 million.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>Share prices on the Shanghai and Shenzhen A markets fell on Tuesday due to continued official warnings about the risks of stock investment, traders said.  </p>
<p>The slide in A share prices was the major factor pulling down repo rates, especially the rates for early-maturing contracts, one trader.</p>
<p>The early-maturing contracts opened higher, supported by a new A share issue on the Shenzhen market, but the sharp falls on the A share markets pushed the rates down for the rest of the session, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected the contracts to move in a narrow range on Wednesday if the A share markets continue to be weak.</p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly up on Tuesday on good market sentiment, traders said.  </p>
<p>The most active 10-year bond that matures in June 2006 rose to 118.09 yuan from 117.64 yuan.</p>
<p>Combined volume of the seven-contract market fell slightly to 1.2 million lots from 1.3 million lots.</p>
<p>Traders said sentiment was strong because of the liquidity recently injected into the market by state debt redemption. This helped spot contract prices to quickly recover from a technical correction on Monday, they said.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected prices to continue to rise in the next few days.</p>
