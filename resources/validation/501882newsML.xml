<p>The New York Stock Exchange wants to attract more Israeli companies among its increasing number of foreign shares, exchange Chairman Richard Grasso said Wednesday.</p>
<p>At the same investment conference addressed by Grasso, a senior Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. executive warned that Israel's stock market would remain a &quot;backwater&quot; shunned by international investors without needed reforms.</p>
<p>Grasso said only four of 65 Israel companies whose shares are traded in the United States were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the world's biggest stock market.</p>
<p>However, the number could increase as Israel's conservative government moves to sell off state companies and implement market reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;The opportunity to bring Israeli companies to the New York Stock Exchange from the perspective of demand, management focus and, most importantly, a willingness to tap the U.S. market to raise capital has never been greater,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The number of non-U.S. companies traded on the New York Stock exchange has doubled in the last three years, to 300, and &quot;we've yet to scratch the surface,&quot; Grasso said.</p>
<p>A key figure for Israeli companies is the potential $1.5 trillion U.S. demand for foreign stocks over the next several years, he said.</p>
<p>Grasso said the number of Israeli companies on the New York Stock Exchange has been limited by listing requirements. Those call for market capitalisation of at least $40 million and 1.1 million U.S. shares outstanding.</p>
<p>He said only four or five companies that trade on the American Stock Exchange or the technology-laden Nasdaq exchange could qualify for the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The four companies on the exchange -- led by conglomerate Koor Industries Ltd. -- have a market capitalisation of about $500 million. That figure is &quot;well over 50 percent&quot; of the valuation of all Israeli companies trading in the United States, Grasso said.</p>
<p>The Merrill Lynch executive, John Heimann, said a New York Stock Exchange listing was key for Israeli companies since many U.S. institutional funds were barred by their own policies from investing in stocks not listed on it.</p>
<p>Heimann, Merrill Lynch's chairman for global financial institutions, criticised Israel's capital markets, saying they were pushing away foreign investment.</p>
<p>He said in part that:</p>
<p>-- securities rules were &quot;basically incomprehensible to most foreign investors;&quot;</p>
<p>-- from 65 percent to 70 percent of the stock in most publicly traded companies were held by company insiders, such as family members, meaning there was no way to discipline bad management;</p>
<p>-- and Israeli companies have never carried out public offerings of shares at the same time in local and international markets, complicating the issuance of stock.</p>
<p>&quot;In sum, clarification and transparency on issues such as (these) are a necessity if Israel wants a broad-based international partnership&quot; in its markets, he said.</p>
<p>Without the reforms, Israel &quot;will remain in the backwater of the world financial system.&quot;</p>
