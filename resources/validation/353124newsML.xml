<title>USA: New home sales at 18-year peak in 1996.</title>
<headline>New home sales at 18-year peak in 1996.</headline>

<p>New home sales in 1996 were the strongest in 18 years, the government said Tuesday, easing only slightly at the end of the year as a key private-sector gauge of overall economic activity signaled steady moderate growth ahead.</p>
<p>New home sales edged down 1 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units after a revised 17.7 percent surge in November.</p>
<p>But for all of 1996, sales climbed 13.3 percent from 1995 to 756,000 -- the best performance since 817,000 new homes were sold in 1978, the department said.</p>
<p>Analysts said strong job growth and relatively low mortgage rates accounted for the strong housing activity, though they forecast some easing in the sales pace this year.</p>
<p>Separately, the Conference Board in New York said its index of leading indicators gained 0.1 percent in December after a revised 0.2 percent November rise -- enough to point to ongoing expansion six to nine months ahead.</p>
<p>The latest reports showing a strong economic close to 1996, but a moderating tone ahead, came as Federal Reserve policy makers were preparing for a two-day meeting to plot interest-rate strategy.</p>
<p>Most analysts were betting the U.S. central bank would decide Wednesday to keep rates steady in the absence of a clear-cut inflationary risk amid a moderating economic tempo.</p>
<p>Nearly seven years after the current expansion began in March 1991, the economy still shows significant strength in key sectors like housing.</p>
<p>December's sales rate of 783,000 was 14.6 percent above the rate a year earlier in December 1995 of 683,000. That followed an upward revision in November sales that previously had been reported rising only 14.2 percent to a rate of 772,000.</p>
<p>&quot;It basically tells us that home sales activity continues to be somwhat brisk,&quot; said economist David Lereah of the Mortgage Bankers Association, &quot;There is still a very healthy appetite out there to buy homes.&quot;</p>
<p>Mortgage rates have recently begun to creep upward, though in December the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said rates for a 30-year mortgage averaged 7.60 percent, down from 7.62 percent in November. But it was higher than the 7.20 percent mortgage rate available a year earlier, in December 1995.</p>
<p>One favorable sign for the industry was that inventories of finished but unsold homes were leaner in December than they had been a year ago. The Commerce Department estimated there were 5.2 months' worth of homes available at last month's sales rate, down from 6.6 months' worth in December 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a very positive reduction in unsold inventory in 1996,&quot; said economist David Seiders of the National Association of Home Builders, adding &quot;The supply-demand relationship is better going into 1997 than it was going into 1996.&quot;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Seiders anticipated 1997 sales of new homes would fall back by about 8 percent to 9 percent this year to around 690,000. A slowdown would be normal after such a strong sales year as was recorded in 1996, he said.</p>
<p>Sales in December were cushioned by a huge 46.7 percent increase in sales in the Midwest to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 176,000, the strongest sales pace since December 1993, when new homes were selling in the region at a rate of 206,000 a year.</p>
<p>In all other regions, sales were down in December.</p>
<p>In the Northeast, sales fell 3.3 percent to a rate of 87,000 a year and in the South they decreased 6.7 percent to 335,000. Sales in the West were down 16.7 percent to 185,000 a year.</p>
<p>Sales of new homes peaked in 1996 at a rate of 820,000 a year in August and have declined in three of the four months since then for which figures have been released. Sales were down 5 percent in September and fell 13.7 percent in October before surging in November and then dropping again in December.</p>
<p>The Conference Board's leading index showed increases in six of its 10 components in December, led by a bigger money supply and a longer factory workweek.</p>
<p>The leading negative components were higher weekly claims for state unemployment insurance and lower factory orders for consumer goods.</p>
