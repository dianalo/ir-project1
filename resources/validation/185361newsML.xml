<title>USA: Westinghouse to cut 1,100 jobs in split.</title>
<headline>Westinghouse to cut 1,100 jobs in split.</headline>
<dateline>PITTSBURGH 1996-11-13</dateline>

<p>Westinghouse Electric Corp said on Wednesday it would eliminate about 1,100 jobs in connection with its split into separate broadcasting and industrial companies.</p>
<p>It said the staff cuts will be in its energy systems and power generation units. The 1,100 cuts will include about 300 from a voluntary separation program, it said.</p>
<p>The reduction is equal to five percent of its workforce, excluding those in government operations, it said, and will cut costs by $80 million annually while strengthening the industries and technology group as a stand-alone company.  </p>
<p>Westinghouse said it expects to take a charge of about $125 million in this year's fourth quarter to cover the cost of severance programs.</p>
<p>The company plans to split itself into separate industrial and broadcasting companies, each with its own management team, board of directors and publicly traded stock.</p>
<p>The staff cuts are in response to the industrial group's smaller size following divestitures earlier this year, the current softness in demand for power plant services, and the need to strengthen its competitive position, Westinghouse said.  </p>
<p>&quot;...Like our customers, we need to adjust our costs in light of deregulation and increased competition, and we will do so without affecting our ability to serve our customers,&quot; Francis Harvey, executive vice president of the industries and technology group, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Westinghouse Chairman Michael Jordan said, &quot;The Westinghouse Electric Company, as our industrial and technology businesses will be called, is solid, well-focused, and has excellent growth potential.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Today's announcement demonstrates our commitment to these businesses and our customers. Our management team is aggressively working to improve performance and become an even more valuable supplier,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are reviewing, rethinking, reshaping, and revitalizing every aspect of our business. When we are finished, we will be a more entrepreneurial company which takes the best of Westinghouse and produces winning results for our employees, customers and our shareholders,&quot; Harvey said.</p>
<p>Westinghouse said the majority of the job cuts are expected to be done by the end of 1996, and the balance in 1997.</p>
