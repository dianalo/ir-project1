<headline>FOCUS-Eurobourses quiet on last day of a good year.</headline>

<p>European stock exchanges, some already closed for the holiday, looked like going out with a whimper rather than a bang on Tuesday, the last day of a year that has seen some sparkling bourse performances.</p>
<p>On the currency front, a firm dollar was holding above the 116.00 yen after testing fresh 45-month highs of 116.25 overnight as weak Japanese asset markets reflected general concerns about the economic outlook. But traders said thin pre-New Year volumes were tending to exaggerate price moves.</p>
<p>London, Europe's biggest bourse which has chalked up a gain of some 11 percent in 1996, opened slightly weaker after a U.S.-led rally drove the benchmark FTSE 100 index to a new record on Monday. At 0945 GMT, the FTSE was 3.2 points lower at 4,112.5, having closed at its highest point ever on Monday at 4,115.7.</p>
<p>Dealers said trading was expected to be thin before the early 1230 GMT close of trading with a last-minute rally made less likely after Wall Street gave up its gains overnight to finish 11.54 points lower.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be a bit of profit-taking, but I can't see any real damage: there's no reason,&quot; said one dealer, who said he expected British blue chips to resume their advance during the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>The German stock exchange in Frankfurt, which along with Amsterdam, Stockholm, Brussels and Tokyo, was closed on New Year's Eve, ended 1996 with the main DAX-30 share index celebrating a whopping 28 percent rise for the year.</p>
<p>Dealers said Frankfurt share trading was boosted by low interest rates and the successful flotation of Deutsche Telekom AG, Europe's biggest-ever initial public offering, in November.</p>
<p>Annual volume was up 40.5 percent to 2,434 billion marks ($1,564 billion).</p>
<p>The Paris bourse, which was soldiering on until its normal 1600 GMT close on Tuesday, opened a little lower, pressured by weaker bond prices and the softer close on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Brokers said trading was expected to be quiet but could be enlivened by the expiry of futures and options in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The blue chip CAC-40 index, though still short of its all-time high of 2360.98 set in February, 1994, has seen a 23.86 percent recovery over the course of the year. It closed on Monday at 2,318.63.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the dollar's end of year march against a weakened yen could continue into the New Year, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen dollar/yen move up in the last three to four trading days...We have had offers all the way up, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it drift higher,&quot; said a trader at a Japanese bank.</p>
<p>&quot;When markets re-open (after New Year), I feel there will be a further attempt on the upside,&quot; the trader added.</p>
<p>Against the mark, however, the dollar was a little softer and dealers said thin holiday volume should keep it within its current range. At 0945 GMT it was trading at around 1.5545.</p>
<p>&quot;There are few releases around today that are likely to change market sentiment ahead of New Year, and many markets are closed or heading for an early close. This should ensure a quiet trading session in most bond and currency markets,&quot; said Chase Investment Bank in a daily briefing note.</p>
<p>On the energy markets, winter chills have sent oil prices rising again this week and European buyers rushed to cover seasonal demand as blizzards swept the continent.</p>
<p>London February futures for bellwether North Sea Brent Blend gained 26 cents to close on Monday at $23.68 a barrel and they were expected to hold at at least these levels on Tuesday boosted by fresh demands, particularly for heating oil in northern Europe.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 0945</p>
<p>The dollar traded around 1.5545 marks and 116.24 yen, compared with 1.5575 and 115.92 on Monday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 0945</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 3.2 points lower at 4,112.5.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was down 3.87 at 2,314.76.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt exchange was closed. The 30-share DAX index ended floor trade on Monday at 2,888.69 points.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was a fraction higher at $369.50 versus its close in London of 369.35 on Monday. Silver was trading at around $4.82.</p>
