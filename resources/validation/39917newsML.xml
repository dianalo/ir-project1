<headline>Commerzbank chief says seeking foreign growth.</headline>

<p>The top executive of Germany's Commerzbank AG said in an interview on Sunday that the Frankfurt-based bank would seek to grow through foreign expansion but was not looking for a merger candidate.</p>
<p>Commerzbank management board chairman Martin Kohlhaussen told Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper he &quot;could not imagine&quot; a merger taking place involving Commerzbank.</p>
<p>&quot;The summer was full of speculation,&quot; Kohlhaussen said, noting Commerzbank was now as large as leading U.S. bank Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>
<p>He did not comment on Commerzbank's interest in Austrian privatisation candidate Creditanstalt as part of an Austro-Italian-German consortium.</p>
<p>The consortium, which includes Italy's Banca Commerciale Italiana, was the only known bidder for the Austrian government's 70 percent stake in Creditanstalt, which it has been trying to sell for more than six years.</p>
<p>Kohlhaussen also said the bank was seeking to expand its foreign branch network while at the same time shrinking its German operations.</p>
<p>He said the plans would lead to a decrease in the number of workers in Germany and growth in foreign areas.</p>
<p>&quot;On a national basis, we will have fewer branches but on an international basis we will have somewhat more and in total a constant level,&quot; Kohlhaussen said.</p>
<p>Kohlhaussen also took aim at Damiler-Benz AG, saying the German industrial giant should reimburse investors in failed plane maker Fokker NV and said discussions so far were not satisfactory.</p>
<p>He said such a large German company should not be able to turn away from obligations &quot;as if it were such an easy step&quot;.</p>
<p>Kohlhaussen has said that investors in Fokker had every reason to believe they were investing in a subsidiary of Daimler and that Daimler bore responsibilty.</p>
