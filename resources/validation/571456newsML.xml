<p>Relatives of a Roman Catholic man killed by a Protestant mob in Northern Ireland said on Friday he was the victim of bigotry and blamed police officers for not saving him.</p>
<p>Nationalist leaders demanded a British inquiry into why police failed to stop the savage beating of Robert Hamill, 25, who died on Thursday, 12 days after the early morning attack in the centre of Portadown, 25 miles south of Belfast.</p>
<p>Irish Prime Minster John Bruton issued a statement condemning the killing in the British-ruled province and said what had happened gave &quot;cause for great concern&quot;.</p>
<p>Bruton said his officials had raised the issue with Britain. &quot;The full circumstances must be established beyond doubt in a transparent way that will command the full confidence of the entire community,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Police announced that the Independent Commission for Police Complaints was probing the incident and said a senior detective had been assigned to work with it.</p>
<p>After the attack police said that they had intervened but were overwhelmed by the size of the crowd. Hamill's relatives said police had ignored pleas for help.</p>
<p>His father Desmond pleaded for no retaliation against pro-British Protestants and for an end to conflict that has stymied peace efforts in the British-ruled province.</p>
<p>&quot;My son's death is the result of sectarian hatred in this town,&quot; he told BBC radio. &quot;I know a lot of great Protestant people that I love and appreciate.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought this peace process would have been alright for everybody. I don't want any Protestant people to be murdered as a result of this, or anybody else. We just want all this to stop.&quot;</p>
<p>The victim's sister Diane said: &quot;Apparently the police were approached but didn't get out (of their vehicle). It was 15 to 20 minutes until the ambulance came and Robert was lying there...and the police didn't render him any first aid.&quot;</p>
<p>A cousin who was with Hamill and another man when they were rounded on by a chanting mob of 30 people said her sister ran to a police vehicle parked nearby.</p>
<p>&quot;My sister ran to the police and said get out and help us, get out and help us,' and they just sat there...The police didn't get out of their jeeps at all...They didn't get out whilst we were on the scene.&quot;</p>
<p>Police sources said officers were dispersing a dozen &quot;loyalists&quot; -- who back British rule of Northern Ireland -- when a coachload of drunken men arrived and attacked four &quot;totally innocent&quot; Catholics who had emerged from a dance hall.</p>
<p>&quot;Police found themselves totally outnumbered until they could get (extra police) assistance,&quot; a security source said.</p>
<p>Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA's politican wing Sinn Fein, challenged Britain's new Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam to set up a full-scale investigation and said police officers should be suspended pending its outcome.</p>
<p>Mowlam, speaking to reporters in Londonderry city, condemned the attack as an &quot;appalling act of sectarian bigotry&quot; and pledged action to combat religious hatred.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a brutal sectarian attack and my officers will be unrelenting in their search for the culprits,&quot; said Portadown police commander Freddie Hall.</p>
<p>The incident was the latest in a spate of sectarian attacks in Northern Ireland, where guerrillas of the Irish Republican Army are fighting for an end to British rule.</p>
<p>Politicians hope the election of a new Labour government in Britain last week may kick-start the stalled peace process.</p>
<p>Britain says Sinn Fein will be given a seat at talks to thrash out all controversial issues if IRA guerrillas abandon their fight against British rule.</p>
