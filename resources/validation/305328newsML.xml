<p>Belgrade's city election commission, in a move highlighting the political power struggle gripping Serbia, overruled a district court on Tuesday to award victory to an opposition coalition in the city's assembly.</p>
<p>Although the decision was clearly a breakthrough for the Zajedno (Together) opposition, it also pre-empted an attempt by hardline members of the ruling Socialist party (SPS) to constitute the city assembly according to fraudulent results.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we decided to annul 45 rulings of the district court,&quot; Radomir Lazarevic, head of the city election commission, told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;This means we have practically restored the situation with the results as found on November 17,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Those results awarded 60 seats to Zajedno, 23 to the incumbent leftist bloc comprising the SPS and allied Yugoslav United Left (JUL), 15 to the Serbian Radical Party and two to the Democratic Party of Serbia.</p>
<p>Votes for the 10 remaining seats would have to be repeated but were not expected to jeopardise Zajedno's majority.</p>
<p>Acting on a complaint by the SPS and JUL on November 18, a Socialist-dominated district court ruled invalid the results for 45 seats and called for a third round which Zajedno boycotted saying the grounds for the court's rulings were invalid.</p>
<p>The Socialist party's decision to annul the municipal election outcome in Belgrade and 13 other cities triggered mass opposition protests which are now in their eighth week and which have developed into a challenge to President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
<p>Lazarevic said the city election commission found legal grounds to overrule the court, acting on an initiative by the New Democracy Party, according to which &quot;the will of the people must be respected&quot;.</p>
<p>Lazarevic cautioned that the results remained preliminary and the city assembly could not be constituted until they were declared official after appeal deadlines expired.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no sensation in our decision (today),&quot; he said. &quot;There were no pressures or blackmail. We adhered to the law to protect the basic rights of the citizens.&quot;</p>
