<p>Taiwan said it remained committed to joining the World Trade Organisation (WTO) despite rival China's indignant comment on Tuesday that it no longer cares whether it joins the global body.</p>
<p>Taipei's application to join the WTO has long been seen as hinging on that of its communist rival. China has said it would not tolerate Taiwan's entry before its own.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite what mainland China says or does, our goal to enter the WTO is clear,&quot; an official at cabinet's Board of Foreign Trade said by telephone, asking that his name not be used.</p>
<p>&quot;We are committed to becoming a WTO member and we have stepped up our effort to achieve that goal,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>In Beijing, the official China Daily quoted Wu Jiahuang, director-general of the customs administration's tariffs department, as saying a deeply frustrated China had become &quot;indifferent and doesn't care any more&quot; whether it joins WTO.</p>
<p>Wu compared China's decade-old bid to enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the WTO that succeeded GATT to a &quot;sunken boat&quot; and an &quot;ailing tree&quot;, the China Daily said in a front-page report.</p>
<p>The Taiwan official said Wu's comments may not represent Beijing's true position, saying it could be a tactic to make the United States, Europe, Japan and Canada rethink their opposition to China's entry for fear it might backfire.</p>
<p>&quot;In our case, no official will make this kind of comments. The entire (Taiwan) administration and parliament are working hand in hand to enter the WTO,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>He declined to say whether Taiwan's WTO application might be further delayed by China's apparent indignation.</p>
<p>&quot;We are doing the best we can, but we have no control over external factors,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Taiwan applied in 1990 to join GATT as a customs territory under the name of Chinese Taipei.</p>
<p>GATT was replaced by the WTO in January 1995.</p>
<p>Taiwan has made major concessions in recent years in its drive to join the world trade body, allowing more imports, opening domestic markets and dismantling state monopolies.</p>
<p>China, which has seen Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war split them in 1949, has said it would accept Taiwan's WTO membership as a customs territory -- but only after China itself gets in.</p>
<p>Taiwan has said it wants to join the WTO in 1997.</p>
