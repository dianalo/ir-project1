<p>Five Belarussian weightlifters have tested positive for banned drugs, throwing into doubt the entire squad's participation in this week's European championships in Croatia, Belarus Weightlifting Federation sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>The five were named as Andrei Marchenko, Vladimir Khlud, Alexei Krushevich, Ruslan Doroshevich and Fyodor Mager. It was not immediately clear what substances had been found in their samples.</p>
<p>The sources said samples taken from the five would be subjected to further tests and the weightlifters could then face sanctions or fines.</p>
<p>Belarus is, with Russia, one of the world's great weightlifting powers, continuing where the Soviet Union left off.</p>
<p>Alexander Kurlovich, a double Olympic medallist in 1992 who took over as Belarus chief coach only a few months ago, himself suffered two doping suspensions in major world competitions.</p>
<p>Marchenko represents Belarus in the 76 kg class, Khlud in 91 kg, Mager at 108 kg and Krushevich and Doroshevich both lift in the over 108 kg category.</p>
