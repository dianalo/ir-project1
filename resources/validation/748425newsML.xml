<p>Left-arm pace bowler Mike Smith is in line for his England debut in the fourth Ashes test, underlining the irony of the Headingley pitch rumpus.</p>
<p>England's decision to switch from the original pitch, which had bare patches and little grass cover, to a back-up strip has dominated the build-up to the test starting on Thursday.</p>
<p>Yet it is often overhead conditions which are the decisive factor at the Leeds venue, prompting England to have Gloucestershire swing bowler Smith ready to confront a buoyant Australia.</p>
<p>Smith is the season's leading wicket-taker with 55 wickets and performed impressively for his county against the Australians last month.</p>
<p>The touring team have responded to the pitch switch by using it as an extra motivational factor, manager Alan Crompton saying on Tuesday that it &quot;will make us even more positive&quot;.</p>
<p>Mark Taylor's side are in confident mood after outplaying England in the third test at Old Trafford where they won by 268 runs to level the six-match series 1-1.</p>
<p>Middle-order batsman Michael Bevan, whose form has been one of the few disappointments for Australia in the series, is to be replaced by Tasmania's Ricky Ponting.</p>
<p>Despite the Old Trafford setback, England's beaten players were given a vote of confidence with unprecedented speed and have been preparing in Leeds since Sunday.</p>
<p>Seven other players have joined them and a final inspection of the preferred pitch will determine whether any of the Old Trafford side are dropped.</p>
<p>Paceman Andy Caddick appears the most vulnerable if Dean Headley has regained full fitness after a side strain.</p>
<p>Whether or not the ground is a favourable one for England, as their captain Michael Atherton claims, it has certainly been a dramatic venue down the years.</p>
<p>Australia won on their last two visits, in 1989 and 1993, after building huge scores but the partisan home supporters who pack the huge, open Western Terrace prefer to remember the epic game of 1981 when England won after following on, thanks to Ian Botham's unbeaten 149 and Bob Willis's eight for 43.</p>
<p>Six years earlier, a potentially thrilling finish was ruined by campaigners who damaged the pitch during the night before the final day in protest at the imprisonment of a London man.</p>
<p>Going further back, Australians can point to the triumphs of the Bradman era, when the great man scored 304 in 1930 and 334 four years later, as well as leading the 1948 team to victory with the then test record-breaking fourth-innings total of 404 for three.</p>
<p>Teams:</p>
<p>England (from)- Michael Atherton (captain), Mark Butcher, Alec Stewart, Nasser Hussain, Graham Thorpe, John Crawley, Mark Ealham, Robert Croft, Darren Gough, Andy Caddick, Dean Headley, Mike Smith.</p>
<p>Australia - Mark Taylor (captain), Matthew Elliott, Greg Blewett, Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Ian Healy, Shane Warne, Paul Reiffel, Jason Gillespie, Glenn McGrath.</p>
