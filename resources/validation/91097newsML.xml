<p>Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, defying government attempts to gag her, slipped out of a police cordon near her home on Wednesday to meet reporters and said up to 800 of her party activists had been arrested.</p>
<p>Her estimate was sharply higher than that of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which said 559 of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party members and supporters had been arrested since last Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it is nearer 800,&quot; she said when told of the number of detentions declared by the SLORC on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Burmese embassy in Bangkok said late on Tuesday that 88 of the 559 detained ahead of an NLD congress planned for September 27-29 had been released.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi told about a dozen reporters at a news conference in a house a few blocks from her residence that she was not down-hearted by the latest action taken by the SLORC.</p>
<p>In fact, the latest government crackdown and its decision to bar access to her residence since last Friday had been anticipated and would help boost her legitimacy, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;What has happened over the last week has been a great help to us,&quot; a relaxed-looking Suu Kyi said. &quot;People are fed up with this kind of stupid behaviour and the international community agrees now the SLORC is getting worse not better.&quot;</p>
<p>A defiant Suu Kyi vowed to hold another party congress without seeking permission from the SLORC.</p>
<p>The United States, Britain and international human rights groups have condemned the latest Burmese detentions.</p>
<p>SLORC officials said at a news conference on Tuesday that the detentions were aimed at preventing any public unrest that could have arisen from the planned NLD party congress.</p>
<p>They also said that the planned party congress and Suu Kyi's weekend speeches, which attract thousands of supporters, were illegal. The SLORC might take action against such gatherings, they added.</p>
<p>Philippine President Fidel Ramos said in Manila the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) might review its policy of &quot;constructive engagement&quot; towards Burma at the ASEAN summit in November.</p>
<p>ASEAN may review its policy of refraining from directly challenging Burma on its human rights record, Ramos told his weekly news conference.</p>
<p>The military has ruled Burma since a 1962 coup. The current governing generals rose to prominence in 1988 when troops crush a pro-democracy uprising and SLORC was set up.</p>
