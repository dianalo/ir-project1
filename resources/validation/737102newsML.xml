<p>Turkey's top court on Thursday rejected a request from the main opposition Islamist Welfare Party for an extra three months to prepare its defence against a bid to outlaw it.</p>
<p>&quot;The court unanimously rejected the request for another extension,&quot; Anatolian news agency quoted Constitutional Court head Yekta Gungor Ozden as saying.</p>
<p>The Islamist party, the biggest in Turkey's 550-seat parliament, faces closure by the court for allegedly threatening the country's secular constitution in a case opened on May 21.</p>
<p>Welfare's deadline to submit its defence had already been extended by two months to August 4.</p>
<p>The written defence is expected to be judged by the court in closed sessions.</p>
<p>Welfare leader Necmettin Erbakan resigned as prime minister in June after months of pressure from Turkey's secularist establishment led by the military.</p>
<p>His year-long coalition with the conservatives of Tansu Ciller deeply alarmed Turkey's secular armed forces with a series of largely symbolic challenges to the NATO-member country's secular and pro-Western traditions.</p>
<p>The Islamist-led government was replaced by a secularist coalition led by Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz who has promised to take measures to rein in rising religious radicalism.</p>
