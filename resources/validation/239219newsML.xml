<title>UK: Impact of gene-maize worries on UK feed seen small.</title>
<headline>Impact of gene-maize worries on UK feed seen small.</headline>

<p>Concerns over the use of a U.S. genetically-modified maize for animal feed in its unprocessed form are not likely to lead to any direct impact on the UK animal feed industry, according to one of its leaders.</p>
<p>Jim Reed, director of the United Kingdom Agricultural Supply Trade Association, told Reuters that &quot;no whole U.S. maize for animal feed is imported directly into the UK.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A bit gets over from the Continent,&quot; he said. But the likely impact was minimal.</p>
<p>There would be much more impact if there were any effect on corngluten feed, he said. UK imports of U.S. corngluten feed run at around 800,000 tonnes per year, he said.</p>
<p>Corngluten feed is used in the UK by feed compounders and on-farm mixers of feed, he explained. It goes into the dairy ration, as well as into feed for pigs. But the indications were that there would be no problem with maize if it is imported in its processed form.</p>
<p>If the EU's scientific experts agree that there is no risk, or only a tiny and acceptable risk from a genetically modified maize developed by CIBA Geigy, the UK and other EU countries will accept its import, a spokesman for the Department of the Environment in London said.</p>
<p>There is no concern over preocessed maize products, the spokesman said. But concern had been expressed over the possible effect of feeding unprocessed maize directly to animals without any processing.</p>
<p>The new maize uses a genetic marker taken from a bacteria which occurs naturally in the gut of animals and is designed to be resistant to the corn borer, he said.</p>
<p>Pesticides are inneffective against the borer, he explained, because it does its boring from the inside of the plant.</p>
<p>The EU Commission is due to decide on December 18 whether to allow imports of the modified maize.</p>
