<p>Shares again tracked bullish overseas markets on Monday to scale new all-time closing peaks in powerful volume -- but with U.S. stocks faltering in early dealings, brokers said the market was looking toppy.</p>
<p>The HEX general index rose 1.72 percent to end at a new record close of 2,668.6 points as advancing issues beat decliners by 76 to 16, with 21 unchanged. Volume was a lively 680 million markka.</p>
<p>&quot;It is starting to be a bit worrisome because it has been up over a percent a day for a while now,&quot; said one. &quot;There should be a correction soon.&quot;</p>
<p>There were gains across the board but financials stood out.</p>
<p>Finland's largest bank Merita added 0.80 markka or over five percent to 15.30, still supported by news it would book extraordinary gains of 1.23 billion markka from returning surplus contributions to the group from its pension fund.</p>
<p>Bourse engine Nokia inched 0.50 markka higher to 297.50 in fairly sturdy volume, but failed to clear the 300 level and gains clearly moderated after its recent spurt as brokers spoke of profit-taking already in the share.</p>
<p>Food group Raisio had a very bullish session, adding 25 markka or over eight percent to 335.00 with volume more meaty than of late. &quot;Investors were looking for stocks which had been forgotten,&quot; another broker said.</p>
