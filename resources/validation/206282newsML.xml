<p>The Slovenian Chamber of Economy said on Thursday it would meet trade unions on November 26 to discuss changes to the general collective agreement, which determines social benefits.</p>
<p>Last month the chamber, along with the Slovenian Association of Employers, pushed for changes to a collective agreement from April 1997, which was followed by a general two-hour strike on October 24.</p>
<p>The chamber suggested the agreement, which was introduced in 1990 and renewed in 1993, should be amended in order to reduce holiday, sick, strike compensation and redundancy payments in financially troubled companies.</p>
<p>&quot;Conditions in the Slovenian economy have changed significantly since the agreement was signed so it has to be changed,&quot; Samo Hribar-Milic, chief of the chamber's cabinet, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Hribar said the high price of Slovenia's workforce is seriously diminishing the country's competitiveness abroad.</p>
<p>The average gross monthly salary in Slovenia, which reached 131,918 tolars in September, rose 17.8 percent in the first nine months compared to the same period in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;We will meet employers but we want the agreement to remain unchanged while we negotiate,&quot; Dusan Semolic, president of Slovenia's biggest trade union, the Asociation of Free Trade Unions said.</p>
<p>He said employers should concentrate more on other causes for Slovenia's poor competitiveness abroad, like high interest rates and taxes.</p>
