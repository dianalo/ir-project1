<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-10-28</dateline>

<p>An investor took some profits in a Micron Electronics Inc put position Monday as the stock continued to decline, traders said.</p>
<p>The investor rolled a position to the January 15 puts from the January 20 puts.</p>
<p>The Micron Electronics January 20 put and January 15 put each traded 2,000 contracts, with 1,500 of each crossing on the Pacific Stock Exchange and 500 crossing on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;We had one customer long 2,000 January 20 puts roll down to 15,&quot; a trader in Chicago said.  </p>
<p>Micron Electronics shares were down 2-5/8 at 15-1/4 on more than one million shares by 1215 CST (1815 GMT).</p>
<p>Micron Electronics shares were trading in the low 20s last week.</p>
<p>Traders were unsure what was hitting the stock, but they said a couple of Wall Street brokerage houses had trimmed earnings outlooks last week.</p>
<p>Few other Micron Electronics options were active outside the January 15 and 20 puts. The January 10 call traded a total of 130 contracts.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are just some small trades back and forth,&quot; the Chicago trader said of dealings in other Micron Electronics options.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest trades Monday were seen in options on MedPartners Inc, which was down 1-1/4 at 21-3/4.</p>
<p>On the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the Medpartners December 22-1/2 call traded 10,500 contracts.</p>
<p>Traders said Morgan Stanley was selling the options, which traded at 3/4, down from their 1-5/8 October 23 close. The option had open interest of about 400.  </p>
<p>An eye-popping move was seen in the premium on Loctite Corp December 55 calls, which surged 2,600 percent, to 3-3/8 from 1/8.</p>
<p>The option had volume of 375 and open interest of 20.</p>
<p>Loctite shares were up 11-1/2 at 57-3/4 by 1215 CST (1815 GMT) after climbing to an all-time of 59 after Henkel KGaA of Germany said it intended to acquire the 65 percent of Loctite it does not already own for $56 a share.</p>
<p>The Loctite December 50 call traded 105 contracts. It rose seven points to eight. --Gregory Crawford, 312/408-8750/Email: derivatives@reuters.com</p>
