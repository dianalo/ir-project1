<p>A combination of weather-related disruptions, terrorist acts and startup setbacks has led the International Energy Agency (IEA) to make big downward revisions to its forecasts for oil output from non-OPEC producers.</p>
<p>The Paris-based agency in its end-August monthly oil market report on Friday cut a substantial 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from its month-earlier forecasts for third and fourth quarter non-OPEC output.</p>
<p>Though non-OPEC supply, according to the IEA, will still be sharply higher than year-ago levels -- up 2.3 million bpd in the fourth quarter alone -- robust demand and stock building has boosted forecasts for demand on OPEC oil minus stock draws to 25.6 million in the final three months of 1996, up 400,000 bpd from the estimate it made a month ago.</p>
<p>The IEA, which serves as the West's energy watchdog, said an explosion at a Mexican natural gas processing plant, pipeline bombings which affected output from Colombia and neighbouring Ecuador and &quot;technical difficulties&quot; at several U.K. North Sea fields and one Australian field led to the downward revisions.</p>
<p>The third quarter shortfalls came largely as a result of production hiccups in Latin America.</p>
<p>The late July explosion at Mexico's largest gas processing plant wiped 60,000 bpd from Mexican natural gas liquids output and 15,000 bpd from crude production in the third quarter while 40,000 bpd of after terrorists sabotaged a pipeline transporting Colombian and Ecuadorean oil.</p>
<p>Brazilian production should be 70,000 bpd less than previously predicted in the third quarter, the IEA said, following &quot;unexpected technical problems and longer than expected maintenance&quot; at Campos Basin offshore fields and low water levels disrupting some onshore output.</p>
<p>In the North Sea, the IEA revised upward by 155,000 bpd its expection for Norwegian output in the third quarter while cutting by 110,000 bpd its U.K. output forecast.</p>
<p>Looking at the fourth quarter, the IEA noted the delay of the U.K.'s Foinaven field west of the Shetlands and the &quot;underperformance&quot; of key fields in the Forties and Ninian crude systems and in Liverpool Bay have led it to cut by 115,000 bpd its previous forecast for British output.</p>
<p>Norwegian output in the fourth quarter will be 40,000 bpd lower than previously predicted, the IEA said. --Karen Matusic, London newsroom, +44 171 542 6280</p>
