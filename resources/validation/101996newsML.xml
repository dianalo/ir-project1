<p>Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien on Tuesday dismissed his controversial chief of the defence staff, Gen. Jean Boyle, only four days after Defence Minister David Collenette resigned under a cloud.</p>
<p>&quot;It is with great regret that I have come to share your conclusion that I must relieve you from your duties as chief of the defence staff,&quot; Chretien wrote Boyle.</p>
<p>Boyle and Collenette, who had chosen Boyle, were engulfed in the scandal over an alleged cover-up of an incident involving Canadian peacekeepers in Somalia in 1992 and 1993 in which Canadian soldiers tortured and killed several Somalis.</p>
<p>The federal Liberal government had been under relentless pressure from opposition parties over the behaviour of both men and their departure appeared to remove two rare chinks in Chretien's generally impenetrable armour.</p>
<p>Boyle, who had headed a Somalia working group before he became the country's top general, had admitted breaking the spirit of Canada's access to information law and had been accused of improperly using his office to protect himself.</p>
<p>For the last few weeks the Somalia affair had become the major focus of both the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party in the daily question period in Parliament's House of Commons, and it dogged Boyle everywhere he appeared publicly.</p>
<p>&quot;With the departure of Mr. Collenette, I believe my continued tenure as chief of the defence staff would increasingly become the focus of attention,&quot; he wrote Chretien in submitting his resignation.</p>
<p>Boyle, 48, who took up his position only last December, said the whole affair was jeopardising the ability of both him and new Defence Minister Douglas Young to focus on important issues facing the Canadian military.</p>
<p>Collenette had said his resignation was solely because of what he called a technical error in breaching cabinet guidelines by writing to an immigration official on behalf of a constituent. But the opposition had insisted the immigration letter was just a smokescreen for him to escape controversy, and on Tuesday they hammered Chretien over the affair.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister would rise in the House and answer time after time that he had confidence in his former minister of national defence, that he had complete confidence in General Boyle,&quot; Bloc leader Michel Gauthier told the House.</p>
<p>&quot;How can the prime minister today explain his sudden turnabout with respect to the one in whom he had so much confidence a few days ago. What has changed?&quot;</p>
<p>Chretien responded that both men had in fact resigned. He assured the House that he did not ask for Boyle to step down, and he said the general specifically said he did not want a new appointment after he stepped down.</p>
<p>A public inquiry has probed the Somalia affair, but after about a year of testimony it is not close to wrapping up.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Young, echoing opposition suggestions, said he was prepared to ask for a preliminary report by next March over the events in Somalia, which led to the disgrace and disbanding of the elite Canadian Airborne Regiment.</p>
