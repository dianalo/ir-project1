<p>UK gilts have little domestic news to trade off this week but U.S. jobs numbers will cast a long shadow and most analysts expect a week of struggle rather than soaring gains.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no real skeletons in the UK cupboard this week but it's hard to see much upside for the market,&quot; said Kevin Adams, gilts analyst at BZW.</p>
<p>He said much of the week would be spent gazing at the United States ahead of non-farm payrolls data on Friday. About 200,000 jobs are expected to have been created in July.</p>
<p>&quot;That may not cause much of a problem but the bottom line is the U.S. economy is growing above capacity. The market will be very sensitive to the jobs figures,&quot; Adams said.</p>
<p>Adams said U.S. institutional investors were holding historically low levels of cash in their portfolios, meaning the bond market may be fully invested. If the Treasury market falls, gilts will inevitably follow.</p>
<p>&quot;People are pretty long of Treasuries. That forms a backdrop to our market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The September gilt future began the week on the back foot and was 9/32 lower at 115-10 midway through Monday.</p>
<p>The gilt/Bund spread, at 152 basis points, managed to break convincingly below 160, after weeks of hovering around that level.</p>
<p>&quot;The spread should continue to narrow steadily,&quot; said Steve Scott, gilts analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.</p>
<p>The key domestic data for the week land on Tuesday, when the Bank of England details how much consumers borrowed in June. A Reuter poll of economists forecast credit rose a net one billion stg last month.</p>
<p>The data offer the latest snapshot of how much of a flood of windfall payments, from building societies becoming banks, was being spent rathern than saved.</p>
<p>About 35 billion pounds in free shares have been handed out to millions of borrowers and lenders in Britain's former mutual societies.</p>
<p>Royal Bank of Scotland economist Neil Parker said credit soared in May as consumers borrowed in anticipation of their windfalls, a process that should now reverse.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the growth of consumer credit will abate somewhat as consumers first use windfall payouts to pay for goods rather than use credit and then the increases in interest rates will have had time to take effect.&quot;</p>
<p>Base rates have been ratcheted up in three quarter point moves, to 6.75 percent, in as many months. Another tightening could follow next week when the Bank of England's monetary policy committee meets again.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing Supply releases its July purchasing managers index. A now familiar story of a strong pound hitting export orders, in contrast to healthy domestic demand, is likely to result.</p>
<p>The yield curve is likely to remain inverted over the week although any further inversion will be concentrated at the shorter end, Adams said.</p>
<p>But Scott advised moving out of two-year gilts into the 2001 stock. &quot;The peak of the curve is at 2001. I would still look to move from 1999s to the 2001s to pick up yield,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Oerall, he too saw little upside for the gilt market. &quot;A 6.8 percent yield seems a reasonable target (for the 10-year gilt) and we are not far away from that. We might well be in the last leg of the bull phase.&quot;</p>
<p>The benchmark 10-year gilt was yielding 6.96 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>One other factor to watch is the path of the pound. Having screamed higher again in recent sessions, peaking at an eight-year high around 3.09 marks last week, it could correct a little, giving foreign investors less incentive to hold gilts.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling is looking a bit toppy now. In the last cycle, the pound pushed up until late 1988 and then turned around even though rates continued to head higher for some time afterwards,&quot; Adams said.</p>
<p>The pound dropped one pfennig on Monday morning, to trade just above 3.03 marks at 1300 GMT.</p>
<p>If the correction becomes significant and the pound ceases to act as a break on inflation -- by hitting exporters and cutting import prices -- speculation about sharper interest rate rises could hit the bond market hard, Adams said.</p>
<p>The December short sterling future, down one basis point at 92.63, discounts base rates a half-point higher at 7.25 percent by the year-end.</p>
