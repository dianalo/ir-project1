<headline>Commodity fall eases off, markets draw breath.</headline>

<p>Key commodity markets mostly ebbed lower on Tuesday but declines were gentler and activity was light as traders took a breather after Monday's dramatic fund sell-off.</p>
<p>Cocoa, the biggest victim on Monday, extended its losses in early trade on further fund and speculative selling before trade buying helped prices bottom out in the London afternoon.</p>
<p>On the London Metal Exchange (LME) a reprieve from Monday's heavy duty fund sell-off saw copper prices push higher and other base metals steady.</p>
<p>Cocoa was given a leg-up when heavy sales failed to emerge at New York's open and trade interest, speckled with light speculative buying, rippled into the market to bargain-hunt, traders said.</p>
<p>May futures ended at 972 stg per tonne.</p>
<p>But traders were not yet convinced prices were ready to go higher. They said the market was only pausing after Monday's drop.</p>
<p>Coffee had a quiet day, shedding just $5 to reach $1,570 per tonne on the London May contract for robusta types.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the flagship LME three month copper contract rose $14 to $2,292 per tonne helped by a drop in world stocks.</p>
<p>Zinc also edged higher on solid foundations laid in morning trade and pushed higher after New York opened to reach $1,260 per tonne, up $13.</p>
<p>But some LME traders said they were on guard for more fund activity over the next few days.</p>
<p>The base metals all managed to keep their heads above water save aluminium alloy which slipped $11 to $1,474 per tonne.</p>
<p>The precious metals split two ways.</p>
<p>Palladium was again the star performer and built on Monday's gains to reach $156 an ounce, up $2.50.</p>
<p>Fuelling the rise is continued delay in Russia over renegotiating sale contracts to Japan, the world's biggest buyer, after they expired at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;It scuppered any plans of getting palladium into Japan,&quot; one London dealer said of the strike. &quot;Even if they did start re-supplying there would be a lot of (backlog of) demand in Japan.&quot;</p>
<p>Platinum picked up on palladium's coat tails to inch higher.</p>
<p>But silver led the way on the downside, slipping to $4.78 an ounce before recovering to end the day unchanged at $4.80 an ounce.</p>
<p>Gold also suffered some selling pressure and dealers saw its outlook capped given the dollar's gains against the yen and the mark.</p>
<p>Bullion dipped to $348.85 an ounce in London, down from the morning fix of $349.10 an ounce.</p>
<p>IPE Brent crude oil edged higher in what traders and brokers said was a technical bounce following recent sharp falls. Brent May futures climbed 12 cents to $17.88 per barrel by 1745 GMT.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat got off to a good start with May futures up more than five cents to $3.86 per bushel early.</p>
