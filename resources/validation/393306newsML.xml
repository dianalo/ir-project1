<p>Moves to restructure South Africa's loss-making Post office were already starting to bear fruit, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo said on Friday.</p>
<p>Speaking at the end of the parliamentary debate on the Post Office Appropriations Bill, Naidoo said he recognised, however, that much still had to be done to improve services to the general public.</p>
<p>During the debate, the Post Office had been harshly criticised by legislators for being inefficient, corrupt and a drain on state finances.</p>
<p>&quot;Already we have begun a turn around in the finances of the Post Office,&quot; Naidoo said.</p>
<p>All posts had been frozen, which had resulted in the work force being trimmed from 26,000 to 23,000. The Post Office budget would in future no longer be dealt with separately and would be drawn into the national budgetary process.</p>
<p>This would ensure that it was no longer given a &quot;blank cheque&quot; in the form of assurances that government would pick up the tab for losses.</p>
<p>&quot;We recognise that there are many inefficiences that have to be dealt with, including the issue of fraud, corruption, the violation of mail and delivery times,&quot; Naidoo said.</p>
<p>&quot;These are issues that are being addressed.&quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, the parliamentary finance committee slammed growing losses in the Post Office and summoned Naidoo to appear before it to explain the situation.</p>
<p>State Expenditure director-general Hannes Smit told the committee that the Post Office had been due to decrease its deficit from 590.4 million rand in 1992/93 to 497.4 million rand in 1993/94, 357.4 million rand in 1994/95 and 171.4 million rand in 195/96.</p>
<p>In 1996/97 it should have had a surplus of 10.6 million rand, but instead it recorded a loss of 572 million rand.</p>
<p>Naidoo said that the losses had arisen mainly because the previous government had initially relied mainly on a plan based on tariff increases to make the Post Office self-sufficient.</p>
<p>What had been needed instead was moves to fundamentally restructure the Post Office and make it leaner and more efficient.</p>
<p>In addition, the planned tariff increases had been abandoned before the 1994 elections and losses had started mounting again.</p>
<p>Naidoo said that remedial action now in hand would start reducing losses and subsidies would be capped to force the Post Offie to become self-sufficient.</p>
