<p>Syria is looking for more local and foreign private investment after the special law giving up to nine years' tax-free operations attracted $8.6 billion of investment over the past five years, a senior official said.</p>
<p>Mohammed Saraqbi, Director of the Investment Bureau, told Reuters in an interview that the response to law number 10, issued in May 1991, was &quot;very good and we look for more private investment by foreigners and Arabs in addition to local businessmen and Syrian expatriates.&quot;</p>
<p>He said 1,457 projects worth 363.3 billion Syrian pounds ($8.6 billion) had been approved since the law was issued. The projects belong to investors of 35 nationalities of which 24 were none-Arab.</p>
<p>&quot;Syria enjoys political stability, has big human and natural resources at cheap prices and has an excellent geographical location in the middle of three continents -- which make a good climate for investment,&quot; Saraqbi said.</p>
<p>Syria's investment law was the only one in the region which did not require a local partner in projects, he said.</p>
<p>Law number 10 gives investors tax-free income for between five and nine years, allows them to import all their needs without customs duties, and imposes no fees or taxes when they buy land or other property for their projects, Saraqbi said.</p>
<p>The law also exempts investors from currency laws and regulations, allowing them to remit their profits in hard currency, and to transfer their capital if they decide to cancel their project within six months.</p>
<p>Both capital and profits can be transferred after five years, which means a project could enjoy a full tax-free operation.</p>
<p>Saraqbi said difficulties initially faced by investors in ensuring enough electricity supplies were overcome with the investment of over $2.0 billion to increase electricity generation.</p>
<p>Economic analysts say Syria which for years had a socialist, fully state-controlled economy, was persisting with a plan of economic reform which it started over five years ago.</p>
<p>The plan eased laws on dealings in hard currency and gives the private sector a greater role, allowing it to engage in industries and businesses which were previously restricted to government control.</p>
<p>The private sector has been allowed to trade in commodities such as sugar, rice and tea and to engage in industries such as the production of cement, textiles and sugar; electricity generation; and oil exploration and refining, they said.</p>
<p>Under a decree issued by the economy minister in September Syrians are now allowed to open accounts in hard currency without being asked about the source of the money.</p>
<p>The central bank also adjusted the pound, fixed for years at 42 pounds to a dollar, to a rate of 43.5. The black market rate ranges between 49 and 51 pounds.</p>
<p>There are two other rates for the pound -- an official rate of 11.2 pounds to a dollar, and the rate of 23 pounds to a dollar used for customs duties.</p>
<p>The government is trying to unify the pound's rates and investors want the rate to be freed to reflect real market valuation.</p>
<p>Economic sources say that investors are still seeking the abolition of law number 24 which imposes harsh penalties on hard currency dealers, although the new currency regulations had automatically cancelled some of its articles.</p>
<p>Investors also want a stock market to be established and economists say a law had been prepared and was still awaiting a political decision.</p>
