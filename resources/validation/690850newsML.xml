<p>MINISTER DEFENDS HIMSELF IN PARLIAMENT</p>
<p>In Parliament, Federal Small Business Minister, Geoff Prosser, has defended himself over claims he has breached the Ministerial code of conduct.</p>
<p>In a statement to the House, Mr Prosser set out his various West Australian business interests and strongly rejected claims they placed him in a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>The minister has been under sustained Opposition attack over claims he breached the code by maintaining his business interests, and contacting a local councillor about a proposed development.</p>
<p>Mr Prosser confirmed he spoke to a councillor about a development, proposal on one of his Bunbury properties, but said he didn't feel his conversation breached the code of conduct.</p>
<p>He said he categorically rejects any allegation he, at any time, has used his ministerial position for personal gain.</p>
<p>The minister also told the House that business arrangements he had in place prior to, and since becoming a minister are within the letter and the spirit of the Ministerial Guidelines.</p>

<p>REGULATION ALLOWING WORKERS TO BE UNFAIRLY SACKED OVERTURNED</p>
<p>The Senate has overturned a new Government regulation allowing small businesses to sack their workers unfairly.</p>
<p>The Government had proposed small business be exempted from the unfair dismissal laws.</p>
<p>The Opposition, Greens and Independents supported a Democrats move to disallow the regulation.</p>
<p>Democrats Senator Andrew Murray says the regulation breached the Government's election promise to provide a &quot;fair go all round&quot; for all employees and employers.</p>
<p>Senator Murray says the new rule would have harmed 1.6 million workers and fail to create a single job.</p>
<p>He says the exemption could also be detrimental to small business, as it could lead to sloppy management practices and higher labour costs.</p>

<p>VICTORIAN POLICE TO CRACKDOWN ON STREET BEGGING</p>
<p>Victorian police will next week begin a crackdown on street beggars, most of whom they say are taking money to supplement other income.</p>
<p>Codenamed &quot;Operation Beggar&quot;, the blitz will involve undercover and uniform police on Melbourne's streets to coincide with the school holidays.</p>
<p>Superintendent Tony Warren, of Melbourne Central Police District, says begging is a growing problem across the city and suburbs.</p>
<p>Superintendent Warren says it's not unusual for beggars to earn $100 dollars a day and that most were drawing on other incomes.</p>

<p>NEW RESOURCE AND RESPITE CENTRES FOR CARERS</p>
<p>The Federal minister for Family Services says planned resource and respite centres for carers, will make carers' jobs easier to cope with, as well as helping those being cared for.</p>
<p>Judi Moylan says at least 56 respite centres for carers will be set up across Australia within the next few months.</p>
<p>Mrs Moylan says they will provide support for carers to gain access to respite services when they need them.</p>
<p>She says there are thousands of carers in the community, and sometimes they just need a little reassurance, assistance or respite to carry out their role effectively.</p>
<p>The minster also launched a toll-free telephone number for carers to contact Carer Resource Centres in each capital city, which will provide information, access and links to the regional services.</p>

<p>COMIC BOOK LAUNCHED TO COMBAT RACIAL ABUSE IN SCHOOLS</p>
<p>A comic book has been launched today in a bid to combat racial abuse in schools.</p>
<p>Called &quot;Takin' A Stand&quot; the comic tells the story of an Australian born Vietnamese boy dealing with racial abuse and bullying at school.</p>
<p>While it has received a positive response, the South Australian Education Department has expressed concern about its references to Asians as &quot;gooks&quot;, &quot;slopes&quot; and &quot;crims&quot;.</p>
<p>But Human Right's Commissioner Zita Antonios says those concerns are ignorant.</p>
<p>Ms Antonios says the Commission worked very closely with young people in developing the publication, and they made it very clear that the comic had to &quot;tell it like it is&quot; to be realistic.</p>
<p>The comic was launched at a Sydney high school where 80 per cent of students come from non-english speaking backgrounds, and where racial problems are vitually non-existent.</p>
<p>It will be distributed to schools and TAFE colleges throughout the country.</p>

<p>WA PARLIAMENT TOLD 22 TEACHER SACKED FOR IMPROPER SEXUAL CONDUCT</p>
<p>The West Australian Parliament has been told 22 school teachers have been sacked in the past year for improper sexual conduct.</p>
<p>Education Minister, Colin Barnett, says the teachers were dismissed under the first stage of a review of all Education Department personnal files to prevent paedophilia and child abuse in Government schools.</p>
<p>Another three people were denied employment as teachers because of their record of abuse against children.</p>
<p>Mr Barnett says the review is currently examining 58,000 files, but 330 were identified as a priority because they included teachers with criminal records of sexual offence or unprofessional behaviour.</p>
<p>Mr Barnett says the review will examine allegations of unprofessional behaviour by teachers stretching back 10 years, and in future teachers will need police clearance before being employed.</p>

<p>SEARCH CONTINUES FOR MISSING CHILD AT MOE</p>
<p>In eastern Victoria, police divers will search a dam near the Moe rubbish tip, as the hunt for Jaidyn Leskie continues.</p>
<p>The boy's father, Brett Leskie, has arrived at the scene, and is being briefed by Homicide detectives.</p>
<p>Earlier police seized the car of the man who was babysitting Jaidyn on the night he disappeared.</p>
<p>It's been brought to Melbourne for extensive forensic testing.</p>
<p>And police are still sifting through rubbish at the tip, in the hope of finding clues to Jaidyn's whereabouts.</p>
<p>Search co-ordinator, Senior Constable Oscar Astson, says members are being forced to wear masks because of the revolting conditions.</p>
