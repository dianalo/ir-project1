<p>President Jacques Chirac faced scorn and praise on Friday for promising a gloomy France more of the same painful austerity despite growing popular discontent.</p>
<p>Nineteen months into his seven-year term, he told voters on Thursday night the country needed more &quot;draconian&quot; budget cuts to restore its finances and join the single European currency before it could revive the economy and curb record unemployment.</p>
<p>In a two-hour television interview, the 64-year-old Gaullist president ruled out a devaluation of the franc suggested by government allies to revive growth and said the euro was vital to give Europe the power to challenge U.S. &quot;hegemony&quot;.</p>
<p>He ruled out dismissing Prime Minister Alain Juppe and blamed discontent on a conservative society fearful of the future and paralysed by traditions and corporatism.</p>
<p>Predictably his supporters hailed his courage for sticking to his line despite the government's record unpopularity while his foes accused him of doggedly ignoring failure.</p>
<p>Chirac &quot;stuck to a policy that doesn't work,&quot; said Socialist Party spokesman Francois Hollande.</p>
<p>Juppe, buoyed by renewed presidential support, said Chirac expressed &quot;a great ambition for a strong, generous and united France&quot;.</p>
<p>Analysts had speculated that Chirac would announce a cabinet reshuffle or an early election and voiced disappointment that he had no major announcement in the long-awaited interview, his first major public statement in five months.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that all?&quot; asked the left-leaning daily Liberation, summing up a general feeling in the press that Chirac had no miracle cure for the country's woes.</p>
<p>The pro-government Le Figaro wrote Chirac had given his rule a &quot;second wind&quot;. The tabloid Le Parisien called the interview, watched live by more than nine million viewers, &quot;The Big Flop&quot;.</p>
<p>Chirac's only new announcement was that he was setting up a commission to reform the judiciary by making state prosecutors independent from the Justice Ministry.</p>
<p>The Magistrates' Union welcomed the plan, which followed charges that the government had ordered prosecutors to drop embarrassing political sleaze probes into close allies of Chirac.</p>
<p>Grilled at length on the probes for the first time since he came to office, Chirac said they must be carried out to the end and &quot;punishment must be all the more exemplary as it concerns people in positions of power.&quot;</p>
<p>Rightists applauded the blame placed by Chirac on society's conservatism, but trade unions were enraged by his accusations that they were determined to sink any reform.</p>
<p>&quot;His determination to shake up all avowed or hidden forms of conservatism is the guarantee of success for the country,&quot; said Michel Pericard, head of the Gaullist party in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>&quot;He said the French were conservative but they're not. Our political and economic rulers are,&quot; said Socialist former culture minister Jack Lang.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot remember any president taking on the unions so headon,&quot; said Marc Blondel, leader of the Workers' Force (FO) union, while Louis Viannet, head of the Communist-led General Labour Confederation (CGT), called the interview &quot;pathetic&quot; and charged Chirac was at a loss for new responses and prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;The French people's fault?&quot; the influential daily Le Monde asked, mocking the president for exposing &quot;the temptation to fire a people that does not deserve such courageous leaders&quot;.</p>
