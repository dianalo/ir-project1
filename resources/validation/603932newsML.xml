<p>South Korea's Dacom Corp forecast on Wednesday its after-tax profit would rise to 21.8 billion won in calendar 1997 from 15.2 billion won a year earlier.</p>
<p>A company official said rising turnover in the areas of personal computer networks and long-distance phone services would contribute to the profit increase.  </p>
<p>The nation's second long-distance phone service provider forecast its turnover would increase to 745 billion won this year from 621 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>The company official said sales from the long-distance call service would rise by 26.7 percent to 220 billion won this year. He said Dacom's share of phone services would rise to 15 percent at end-1997 from eight percent early this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We will reach the break-even point in phone services this year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dacom launched its domestic long distance service last year, but did not win as large a market share as it had expected.  </p>
<p>A surge in turnover from the value-added PC network service would be the major reason behind the profit increase.</p>
<p>Dacom said sales from the network business would rise 66.6 percent to 88.5 billion won this year.</p>
<p>Subscribers to its network business grew to 750,000 in May, 1997 from 21,000 in 1996. The company forecast the number would jump to three million by the year 2000.</p>
