<p>LIFFE coffee futures reversed direction to end in the minus column after a stunning week-long rally in the run-up to a key producer meeting in Brazil lost steam.</p>
<p>Traders said the retracement was also seen as a technical correction to the well overbought condition in the market which saw a jump of 21 percent in four days.</p>
<p>The market took off higher as speculators bought on the back of overnight news the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) would limit exports by a further 1.3 million 60-kg bags between January and June.</p>
<p>The early buying drove the March contract to just above the $1,600 mark.</p>
<p>&quot;Its failure to hold above $1,600 and then New York's failure to move high led to sell stops in London,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Coupled with pre-weekend profit-taking, the decline gradually gathered momentum and the second-month contract finished $50 down at $1,520 a tonne after ranging within a large $98 band.</p>
<p>The day's volume reached a modest 8,834 lots.</p>
<p>The ACPC export cut was announced after a meeting in Brazil late on Thursday. Some traders viewed it as constructive although it fell short of a previously-stated goal of 2.5 million bag reduction.</p>
<p>&quot;It will certainly help robusta producers get better prices,&quot; said one. But they warned that the plan which would involve a cut of 1.0 million bags of robustas and 300,000 bags of arabica could be undermined by non-members.</p>
<p>&quot;So far the ACPC has succeeded in reducing consumer stocks and if they succeed in restricting exports, the market can be in their hands,&quot; the trader added.</p>
<p>But despite the dramatic increase in robusta values,  its price differential to the premium arabica coffee gapped wider to 68 U.S. cents a lb basis March.</p>
<p>Thursday's positive ACPC news was partly overshadowed by reports that dockworkers at a major Colombian coffee port had ended their prolonged strike.</p>
