<p>Congress's latest effort to overhaul antiquated U.S. banking laws will come to a vote in the House Banking Committee on Friday after a &quot;killer&quot; amendment was rejected late on Thursday.</p>
<p>By a slender three vote margin, the banking panel rejected an amendment from New York Democrat John LaFalce and Washington Republican Jack Metcalf that would have preserved the federal thrift charter.</p>
<p>The banking industry had vowed to oppose the entire bill if the thrift charter was retained, a move that almost certainly would have prevented the bill from moving forward.</p>
<p>After debate on a few more amendments, the committee adjourned until 0900 EDT (1300 GMT) on Friday.</p>
<p>Committee chairman Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, said he expected the committee to vote on the bill Friday but declined to predict the outcome of the vote.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll just have to wait and see,&quot; he told reporters after Thursday's session ended. &quot;There are pluses and minuses (in the bill) for every single industry group.&quot;</p>
<p>If the committee approves the bill, the legislation moves to the Commerce Committee for further consideration. Leach said lawmakers had a &quot;general agreement&quot; that the Commerce Committee would finish its work on the proposal within 30 days.</p>
<p>Lobbyists said they expected the Commerce Committee might broaden provisions allowing banks to own or be owned by commercial companies. Commerce Committee members may also impose greater state insurance regulation on banks, lobbyists said.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, Congress has sought to overturn the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act and allow banks to enter other financial businesses. But bickering among the various industries has always prevented lawmakers from approving legislation.</p>
<p>Most groups said Thursday evening they were still on the fence about the banking committee's bill.</p>
<p>&quot;We had concerns going in,&quot; Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Richard Carnell told Reuters after the session. Some of Treasury's concerns were addressed, but the administration is not ready to offer its verdict yet, Carnell said.</p>
<p>Two leading trade groups also offered mixed assessments of the legislation.</p>
<p>The American Bankers Association has &quot;tremendous problems&quot; with provisions related to lifeline banking, title insurance sales, and insurance regulation, the group's top lobbyist Ed Yingling said. But the group has not made a final determination about its position.</p>
<p>Robert Rusbuldt, lobbyists for the Independent Insurance Agents of America, said &quot;right now, we don't support or oppose the bill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We still want to have the functional regulation issue addressed at some point in the legislative process,&quot; he said.</p>
