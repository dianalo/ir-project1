<p>Indonesian coconut oil prices were generally stable on Friday, while copra was easier on ample supply, traders said.</p>
<p>They said RBD coconut oil was quoted at 1,920 rupiah/kg in Jakarta, unchanged from a week ago, while copra was down at 860 rupiah/kg from 900 rupiah/kg.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is stable, with demand from refineries producing cooking oil remaining good,&quot; one trader said. &quot;There has not been much problem with the weather, despite some rain.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said they expected coconut oil prices to undergo a correction next week, following falls in Europe overnight.</p>
<p>Coconut oil closed with sellers $7.50 to $12.50 down after March/April traded at $750 per tonne cif Rotterdam.</p>
<p>Indonesian traders said, however, they were hoping an expected strengthening of coconut oil prices in the Philippines due to rains would lift local sentiment.</p>
<p>Indonesia is the world's second largest coconut producer after the Philippines, and exporters often look to Manila for price direction.</p>
