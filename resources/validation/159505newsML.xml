<title>UK: Timing of BT, MCI talks seen favourable.</title>
<headline>Timing of BT, MCI talks seen favourable.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Talks on a possible strategic merger between British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp of the United States could be well timed, analysts said on Friday, although a number of obstacles stand in the way.</p>
<p>MCI had earlier confirmed that it was in discussions with BT, which already has a 20 percent stake in it, on establishing a &quot;possible strategic merger&quot;.</p>
<p>Daiwa Europe Research analyst John Clarke said the timing for a move on MCI could be good, with potential U.S. rivals tied up by the need to restructure to cope with the opening up of the U.S. telecoms market.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly if they are going to, now is the time to do it because their cash-rich rivals have other fish to fry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Another analyst, who declined to be identified, said however that strict federal laws on foreign ownership of U.S. companies could stand in the way of a closer tie-up.</p>
<p>He added that a standstill agreement between the two companies on BT's 20 percent stake in MCI &quot;is a long-term one with several years to run...That's another obstacle.&quot;</p>
<p>But he said that after BT invested in MCI &quot;...it was clear if anyone were to invest further it would be BT.</p>
<p>He said the two companies' global corporate communications venture Concert &quot;...is what they wanted out of the deal and that is progressing quite well.&quot;</p>
<p>MCI said on October 22 that Concert had $1.5 billion of revenues currently under contract and described it as an &quot;unqualified success&quot;.</p>
<p>The analyst added that BT bought its stake in MCI at around $32 in 1993, paying a premium for the shares.</p>
<p>Daiwa's Clarke said a BT merger with MCI &quot;would put all their eggs in the U.S. basket&quot; and raise questions about BT's future intentions in the European telecoms market.</p>
<p>BT suffered a serious setback in September after German utility RWE severed links with BT to join a rival consortium led by Cable &amp; Wireless Plc.</p>
<p>At the end of September it signalled its ambitions in the French market through a consortium involving Compagnie Generale des Eaux.</p>
<p>Trading in MCI shares was halted at 1832 GMT on Friday after a last trade of $27/1/4, up 5-5/8, pending a news announcement.</p>
<p>One analyst said he would have expected to see the MCI price spike up much higher than the $30 level on this news.</p>
<p>BT shares in London were unaffected by the news, which broke after the close of trading. BT shares closed down 4 pence at 355 1/2 pence.</p>
<p>However, BT's ADR traded in New York were down 1-5/8 at 56, off a low of 55-7/8 at 1944 GMT.</p>
