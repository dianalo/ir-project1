<p>Near-perfect growing conditions in the southern Plains during May set the stage for U.S. farmers to harvest the largest wheat crop in three years, the government said on Thursday.</p>
<p>It also said farmers were on track to harvest a record soybean crop and the second-largest corn crop, although some analysts say recent rainy, cool weather crimped the crops.</p>
<p>Based on conditions at the start of this month, the Agriculture Department forecast the wheat crop at 2.30 billion bushels, up 43 million from its May estimate due to the improved growing conditions.</p>
<p>The increase was larger than analysts expected and depressed wheat prices at the Chicago Board of Trade.</p>
<p>In April, a hard freeze hit the U.S. hard red winter wheat crop in the Southern Plains. Until then, the region had been on course to produce a bumper crop.</p>
<p>Conditions were reversed in May, as near-perfect weather boosted yields enough to recoup some of the freeze losses.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really been an ideal situation since the freeze,&quot; said Gregg Doud, an analyst with World Perspectives.</p>
<p>To the suprise of some analysts, the department left its forecast of 1997 corn production unchanged at 9.84 billion bushels, despite cool Midwestern weather in May.</p>
<p>Last month, the department went out on a limb and forecast average U.S. corn yields at 131 bushels per acre, or 3 bushels higher than normal &quot;trend&quot; increases would suggest, because of rapid early plantings.</p>
<p>The department's decision not to reduce its yield forecast, despite less-than-ideal growing conditions, &quot;ups the ante&quot; for the July report, when it may have to make a more drastic reduction, said Bill Biedermann, with commodity analysts Allendale Inc., in McHenry, Ill.</p>
<p>The department kept its estimate of the 1997 U.S. soybean crop at a record 2.60 billion bushels. However, soybean prices rallied in early trading on strong weekly export sales.</p>
<p>Soybeans -- used in a variety of everyday food products as well as in industry -- will remain in short supply until the fall harvest.</p>
<p>But the department raised its estimate of pre-harvest soybean stocks slightly to 130 million bushels, reflecting increased imports by processors such as Cargill Inc. which are concerned about keeping operations going.</p>
<p>At midday, traders at the Chicago Board of Trade were paying more attention to export sales data than the department's crop report. Wheat for July delivery was down 5 cents to $3.59-1/2 a bushel, July soybeans were up 11 cents to $8.41 a bushel, and corn was steady. July corn was $2.72-1/4 a bushel.</p>
