<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin, recovering from massive open heart surgery, will address the nation within days, but doctors want him to take things easy for a while, the Kremlin said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;He has to make haste slowly,&quot; spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing, adding that doctors were keen that Yeltsin did not overdo things.</p>
<p>He said no date for Yeltsin's address to the people had been set yet but stressed that it would be in the next few days. The Kremlin has not made clear if Yeltsin will speak on radio or television.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky said German Chancellor Helmut Kohl spoke to Yeltsin by telephone for seven minutes on Tuesday and had also advised Yeltsin not to work too hard.</p>
<p>It was Yeltsin's first conversation with a foreign leader since his seven-hour quintuple bypass operation a week ago.</p>
<p>Doctors are examining Yeltsin every day and the Kremlin has released medical bulletins stressing that the president is recovering well. They expect him to be back in the Kremlin by early next year after a period in a sanatorium.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky said Kohl had repeated an invitation that Yeltsin convalesce in Germany. The Russian president had not yet responded to the invitation.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who is recovering from the bypass in the elite Central Clinical Hospital, traditionally meets his prime minister on Tuesdays.</p>
<p>But Yastrzhembsky told a Kremlin news conference the two men had spoken by telephone this Tuesday, discussing the situation in the army and other topical issues.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Igor Rodionov warned on Tuesday that Russia's deepening economic crisis was exacerbating problems in the underfunded armed forces.</p>
