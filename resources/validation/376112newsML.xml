<headline>Dow soars through 7,000 points, bonds rally.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 7,000 points for the first time Thursday, while bonds rallied after the Treasury's $10 billion quarterly auction.</p>
<p>The dollar rose against the Japanese yen, but ended lower against the German mark as a German official voiced concern over its strength.</p>
<p>The stock market rode a wave of investor confidence based on low interest rates and non-inflationary economic growth.</p>
<p>The Dow ended up 60.81 points, or 0.87 percent, at an all-time high of 7,022.44, beating the previous record set just Wednesday. The rally capped a breathtaking run that has added 1,000 points to the blue-chip index in just four months.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index also set a new high, gaining 9.05 to 811.82. In the broader market, advancing issues swamped declines 1,717 to 820 on very heavy volume of 584 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Early in the session, the Dow staged a series of brief forays above 7,000 but failed to mount a serious charge until the recently dormant bond market sprang to life.</p>
<p>&quot;This market is interpreting everything positively right now,&quot; said Charlie Crane, director of research at Spears Benzak Salomon &amp; Farrell. &quot;Today, all of a sudden the bond market got its legs and pretty soon, stocks were dancing.&quot;</p>
<p>The bond rally, which began just after the Treasury sold $10 billion in bonds in a quarterly auction, lifted the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond nearly a full point, which reduced its yield to 6.63 percent from 6.71 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Stoking the demand for stocks was a strong dollar, analysts said, citing a variety of reasons that the currency's recent rise has lifted the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar's strength is diminshing fears of inflation because a strong dollar tends to lower the cost of imports,&quot; said Jack Shaughnessy, director of research at Advest. &quot;Clearly, inflation has always been a critical variable for the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Another by-product is renewed international demand for U.S. financial assets.</p>
<p>While the favourable economic backdrop remained intact, stocks still needed evidence of continued corporate earnings growth to sustain their rally. The just-concluded wave of fourth-quarter results provided that, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are two things that matter, interest rates and corporate earnings,&quot; said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. &quot;Rates are coming down and corporate earnings are still showing powerful growth.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar ended mixed as a German official voiced concern over its continuing strength and speculation emerged in London that central bankers had stepped in to sell dollars for yen.</p>
<p>But traders said solid economic growth in the United States, coupled with sharp gains in U.S. stock and bond markets, sustained investors' interest in the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is, the fundamentals look very good for the dollar,&quot; said Hans Boman, chief spot currency dealer at Swedbank in New York.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to 1.6847 marks late in New York from 1.6892 late on Wednesday, but it rose to 124.40 Japanese yen from 124.25 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Coffee prices rose to a 21-month high Thursday on concerns about tight supplies in South America and possible shipping problems in strikebound Colombia.</p>
<p>At New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, March coffee ended up 8.20 cents at 180.05 cents a pound, its highest close in 21 months.</p>
<p>March frozen concentrated orange juice futures closed 2.35 cents higher at 76.90 cents a pound at the New York Cotton Exchange, bouncing back from a steep drop on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index rose 22.8 points to 4,327.1. Tokyo stocks rallied for the third straight day, and the Nikkei average of leading 225 issues finished up 278.10 points or 1.5 percent at 18,688.06.</p>
