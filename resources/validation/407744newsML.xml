<p>President Bill Clinton said on Thursday he was pleased that a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget seemed likely to fail in Congress but lawmakers must now pass a real balanced budget plan.</p>
<p>&quot;It now seems clear the balanced budget amendment will not pass. I think that is a good thing,&quot; Clinton said in a speech to the Business Council, a big business lobbying group.</p>
<p>It was his first comment on the matter since Sen. Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, said Wednesday he would vote against the amendment, apparently denying it the votes needed for its passage in the Senate.</p>
<p>&quot;But it must also be clear to the American people that we must make sure that a balanced budget does pass, passes this year and passes as soon as we can reasonably pass it,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to now go beyond the constitutional debate to get to the specifics. I am convinced that if we pass a balanced budget plan this year it will moderate interest rates, spur more investment and keep growth going,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;My appeal to you is to tell every one of us every time you get a chance to say it -- that you cannot celebrate Thanksgiving this year without a balanced budget,&quot; Clinton told the executives. The holiday falls in November.</p>
<p>&quot;Get the job done this year. We need it done this year. If you don't, it will have a destructive impact on the market. If you do it will have a positive one,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is that we are well within range of being able to get this down if we'll all just hunker down and kind of turn down the rhetoric and treat each other with good faith,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Republicans want to amend the Constitution to require a balanced federal budget, a complicated procedure requiring two-thirds support of both houses of Congress and approval of three-quarters of the 50 states.</p>
<p>That process had just begun in the Senate when Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who held the required 67th supporting vote, announced he would vote against.</p>
<p>In 1995 the amendment passed the House of Representatives but failed by one vote in the Senate.</p>
<p>Opponents say the amendment could jeopardise key social spending programmes such as Social Security for the elderly with rigid requirements for cost cutting.</p>
<p>They also say it would tie the government's hands to spend money at a time of crisis while arguing it was not necessary to tamper with the Constitution to achieve sound budget goals.</p>
<p>On Feb. 6, Clinton put forward his plan for balancing the budget by 2002, when he forecast the government would show a $17 billion surplus. Republicans have challenged that, saying in contrast that the budget would show a $50 billion surplus.</p>
<p>The next week he discussed the matter with top Congressional Republicans, who control both houses of Congress, but the two sides appear to have made little progress so far.</p>
