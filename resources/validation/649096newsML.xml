<p>Several world-class athletes, including Olympic stars Michael Johnson and Carl Lewis, will be missing when the U.S. national championships start here on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Big attractions Johnson and Lewis won't even be in town, and world record-holders Dan O'Brien and Mike Powell have bowed out because they, like Johnson, are injured.</p>
<p>Mary Slaney, the queen of American runners, also is unlikely to participate, but not by choice. The 38-year-old Slaney is under IAAF suspension for a doping test at last year's Olympic trials, and U.S. officials are not expected to defy the IAAF edict although they have not suspended her.</p>
<p>Against this background of intrigue and uncertainty, American athletics is likely to experience the beginning of a changing of the guard, coaches and officials say.</p>
<p>While Olympic champions Allen Johnson, Derrick Adkins, Charles Austin, Kenny Harrison, Randy Barnes and Gail Devers and women's 400-metre world record holder Kim Batten seem certain to secure world championships berths in the five-day qualifier, new faces also are expected to emerge.</p>
<p>&quot;The first year after the Olympics is always a beginning of the changing of the guard,&quot; said Dean Hayes, who will coach the U.S. men in Athens in August.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Hayes figures, &quot;about 30 per cent of the people who made the team last year will make the team this year.&quot;</p>
<p>But this year's championships are particularly hard hit, at least in star quality.</p>
<p>Lewis, on the verge of retirement, is skipping the meeting by design, but double Olympic champion Johnson, injured in last week's million-dollar race with Donovan Bailey, had hoped to add another world title.</p>
<p>So had three-time world decathlon champion O'Brien. But under U.S. rules only those who finish in the top three in the American championships are eligible for the world meeting.</p>
<p>Another doubtful entry, defending women's 100-metre champion Gwen Torrence, has decided to compete despite knee and leg problems. But she will run only the 200-metres.</p>
<p>Three-time Olympic finalist Dennis Mitchell says he expects to find a way to make the team despite nagging injuries. Former world record-holder Leroy Burrell and 1992 Olympic 200-metre champion Michael Marsh also expect to be contenders in the 100-metres.</p>
