<p>Raven Industries Inc said Wednesday that several new products in its agricultural electronics field boosted its top-line growth in the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31.</p>
<p>&quot;These products included precision depth controls for planting, tillage and harvesting operations,&quot; said president David Christensen in a statement.</p>
<p>The company's contract electronics business also was a strong performer, Christensen said, with sales doubling to $18 million in fiscal 1997. &quot;We expect continuing future growth in this area,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Christensen said operating income in the company's plastics segment was up 29 percent on a seven percent sales rise in fiscal 1997.</p>
<p>He said Raven had improved profit for its truck topper line but said &quot;we need a great deal of further improvement to get this operation to an acceptable profit level.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition, he said the company's tank business saw a downturn in its agricultural segment in the first half, but posted a good second-half recovery. &quot;Profits and sales for the full year, however, ended slightly below last year,&quot; Christensen said.  </p>
<p>Christensen said Raven's sewn products, or special apparel segment, showed a strong recovery in fiscal 1997 with sales up 13 percent for the year and profits &quot;making a substantial gain.&quot;</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter, Raven reported earnings of $0.45 per share, up from $0.34. Sales advanced to $38.4 million from $29.8 million. For the full year, earnings rose to $1.61 per share from $1.30 and sales gained to $139.4 million from $120.4 million.</p>
