<p>The government said Wednesday that Quaker State Corp settled charges it falsely advertised that Blue Coral &quot;Slick 50&quot; engine treatment would reduce engine wear.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission said that if consumers recovered less than $10 million in class action suits pending against Quaker State for the allegedly false advertising, the commission would have the option of further pursuing the company.  </p>
<p>Quaker State subsidiaries falsely claimed that the product &quot;reduces wear (on engines) up to 50 percent for 50,000 miles,&quot; the FTC alleged.  The company also allewgedly falsely claimed that without the product there would be &quot;unseen damage&quot; when an engine was started, the FTC said.</p>
<p>The government said that, in fact, most engines are adeqeuately protected from wear at start-up by motor oil.</p>
<p>The agreement also requires Quaker State and its subsidiaries to refrain from making false claims in the future regarding the &quot;Slick 50&quot; product.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Quaker State said the company producing Slick 50 was already under investigation when it was purchased by Quaker State.  He said the ads had been discontinued.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Slick 50 is oil with Teflon added. The spokesman said that Quaker State believes the product increases wear reduction properties of oil and extends the life of the engine.</p>
<p>Quaker State manufactures and sells motor oil.</p>
