<headline>Planting delays seen lowering Texas crop yields.</headline>

<p>Recent heavy rains through the southern half of the U.S. have disrupted corn, sorghum and rice plantings and will probably result in yield reductions in some Texas crops, agronomists there said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're a month and half late for corn and sorghum, and we're approaching a month late for cotton,&quot; said Cloyce Coffman, agronomist at Texas A &amp; M University.</p>
<p>The latest crop report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed 40 percent of the corn crop was planted as of Sunday versus 51 percent at the same time last year.  </p>
<p>&quot;Compared to what the normal long-term average weather would be, we are expecting a yield reduction of 30 to 50 percent in the late-planted crops,&quot; Coffman said.</p>
<p>In central Texas, the weather is allowing some producers to begin planting corn and sorghum, but the cotton crop has yet to be planted, Coffman said.</p>
<p>No relief from the rain is seen in forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like it will be another six to eight days before they (producers) can get anything done,&quot; Coffman said.  </p>
<p>According to the latest forecast from Weather Services Corp. in Lexington, Mass., there is a chance of rain and thunderstorms each day through Saturday.</p>
<p>The rains have also slowed rice planting. Only two percent of the Texas rice crop was planted as of Sunday, versus 44 percent last year and a five-year average of 29 percent, said the state's latest crop report.</p>
<p>&quot;Planting remained critically behind schedule along the Upper Coast because of very wet conditions,&quot; the report said. &quot;Little, if any progress occurred during the past week.&quot;  </p>
<p>Flooding in Arkansas, which is the nation's largest rice producing state, has yet to seriously affect planting because it is still too early in the season, agronomists there said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Governor Mike Huckabee declared 23 counties in southern Arkansas disaster areas after steady rains flooded hundreds of homes and businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't even recommend that rice be planted until tomorrow (Thursday) said Walter Mayhew, agronomist at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. &quot;We have a long planting window here.&quot;  </p>
<p>Arkansas farmers can still achieve optimal rice yields if they plant during the remainder of April through the first half of May, but rice can be planted up until June, Mayhew said.</p>
<p>Although it is still early in the planting season, some crop observers warned that continued rains will cause big problems for Arkansas farmers.</p>
<p>&quot;If the rains continue, it is going to be serious,&quot; said J.P. Gaines, publisher of the Rice Market Advisory Letter in Folsom, La. There hasn't been much planted, so the losses aren't great yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The latest weekly crop report showed Arkansas rice plantings at seven percent planted, versus a year-ago figure of one percent.</p>
<p>The Arkansas report also showed corn and sorghum plantings ahead of year-ago levels.</p>
