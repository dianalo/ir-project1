<headline>FORECAST - UK house prices to grow, but no boom.</headline>

<p>UK house prices will rise by an average of around 4-1/2 percent in 1996 and 6-1/2 percent in 1997, fuelled by increased consumer confidence and improved affordability, economists and mortgage lenders said in a Reuters survey.</p>
<p>But the 16 respondents stressed that, while prices would grow by more than the 2-3 percent predicted in a previous survey in March, the increase would be gradual and could taper off towards the end of 1997 as an expected post-election monetary tightening took its toll.</p>
<p>Yet it is still good news for the ruling Conservative party, searching for signs of a &quot;feel-good&quot; factor to boost re-election prospects. A UK general election must be held by May 1997.</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers and Williams de Broe, with their respective 1997 forecasts of 10.6 and 15.5 percent, are anticipating stronger growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Builders are not increasing the number of starts significantly, so all the extra demand translates into prices rather than a mixture of prices and volumes,&quot; explained Michael Dicks, UK economist at Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>Economists reckon consumers are once again viewing houses as an investment vehicle which could produce positive returns and this is encouraging demand, despite many home-owners still languishing under a cloud of negative equity.</p>
<p>&quot;People's memories are short. When they smell the possibility of making money they forget about the events of the past,&quot; said Rob Thomas, housing analyst at UBS.</p>
<p>At the moment, houses look cheap in relation to income, economists said, with strengthening earnings nudged higher by tax cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing a pickup in demand for housing driven by the fact that real take-home pay has accelerated quite sharply,&quot; said Lehman's Dicks.</p>
<p>This, combined with a low interest rate environment, has tempted would-be sellers back to the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The housing market has been moribund for about five years, so there's a bit of catch-up going on,&quot; said Ian Amstad, senior European economist at BT Gilts.</p>
<p>Recent price data released by the Halifax and Nationwide building societies pointed to a steady housing market recovery rather than a full-scale boom.</p>
<p>As the market picks up, the number of transactions will start to catch up with the recent price increases, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sellers will start coming back into the market and this will help to slow down the rate of increase of prices,&quot; said Ian Shepherdson, chief UK economist at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it will get to the point where it starts pushing prices down again, but I think it will moderate the rate of increase and we'll see a continued steady increase rather than any sort of boom,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Other factors which would put a lid on any house price surge include the predicted rising cost of financing a mortgage and a reluctance among consumers to increase their level of debt, as well as a possible fiscal tightening after the general election.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy will be growing next year and ... interest rates will no longer be falling so in effect the cost of finance is going to rise,&quot; said Trevor Williams, economic advisor at Lloyds Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Fiscal policy stance in a run-up to an election is usually loose. Post election, this will tighten and the income effect on that will mean house price growth will be not much above five percent,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Halifax house price index showed a seasonally adjusted monthly house price inflation rate of 0.5 percent in August, making an annual rate of 5.7 percent.</p>
<p>The Nationwide's index pointed to a seasonally adjusted increase of 1.7 percent in August, corresponding to an unadjusted annual rise of 5.4 percent.</p>
<p>Detailed results of the poll on annual average house price growth follow. Ten building societies were contacted in total, but seven declined to participate in the survey.</p>
