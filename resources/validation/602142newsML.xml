<p>A low inflationary environment and technological advances continued to restrain U.S. wage pressures, helping to keep the Federal Reserve from further tightening of monetary policy on Tuesday, experts said.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate in the U.S. fell to 4.9 percent last month, even as average weekly earnings of workers, after adjustments for inflation and seasonal factors, fell 0.9 percent in April.  </p>
<p>Paul Samuelson, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for economics, said U.S. workers were more willing to accept lower paying jobs than their European counterparts who were highly unionized -- leading to double-digit unemployment rates in many European countries.</p>
<p>Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has stated that he would look to rising wages as a barometer of potential inflationary pressures. The earnings level may have been one of the primary reasons the Fed failed to tighten monetary policy at its meeting on Tuesday, experts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;American workers are willing to accept relatively less than the average European, but wages are still near average,&quot; said Marvin Kosters, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.</p>
<p>Kosters said no one would argue that advancing technology, and the productivity growth that goes with it, have held down prices, but that it was hard to assess by how much. First quarter nonfarm productivity rose by 2.0 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are a number of puzzles in the labor market. Historically one thing that has influenced wage demands a good deal is inflation,&quot; Kosters said. &quot;Maybe we don't place enough value on the stable price environment we've had in recent years.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the inflationary environment seen from the late 1960s to early 1980s created a lot of skepticism about price stability, and that skepticism had been reduced -- leading to less demand for higher wages.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's been a lot of structural change, but not a substantial decline in manufacturing compensation,&quot; said David Levy, vice chairman and director of forecasting at the Jerome Levy Institute at Bard College.</p>
<p>What differentiated the U.S. from Europe was a much less rigid regulatory system, he said. In many European countries, government approval was necessary to downsize operations, even if the operations weren't profitable.</p>
<p>Levy said activism on the part of instituional investors also had affected the labor market over the past 10 years.  </p>
<p>&quot;The entitlement age we saw as we entered the 1970s (is gone),&quot; Levy said. There likely would be some catch-up in compensation in certain lines of work, he said, but they would not be sustainable.</p>
<p>Demand was mostly in high technology fields, though some pickup also was seen in wages for low-end jobs, he added.</p>
<p>The Fed restrained from moving partially because of concern about another tightening hurting the stock markets, Levy said. Policymakers also want to get a clearer reading on consumer spending before moving again, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think labor costs alone will push the Fed to tighten. They know real interest rates are high,&quot; Levy said.</p>
