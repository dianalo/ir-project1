<headline>Japan-U.S. port dispute heats up.</headline>

<p>A Japanese port services group vowed Friday to fight U.S. calls for reform, dealing a further blow to efforts to resolve a dispute over what the United States has branded discriminatory practices at Japanese ports.</p>
<p>U.S. maritime authorities are to slap sanctions on Japanese shippers next month in protest over the treatment of foreign firms by the Japan Harbour Transportation Association -- a group of cargo handling firms.</p>
<p>&quot;If America wants to pick a fight, we'll fight,&quot; Shiroo Takashima, chairman of the JHTA, told Japan's NHK public television.</p>
<p>Dock workers are also raising the temperature of the dispute with a protest strike planned for next week over what they call U.S. &quot;gunboat diplomacy.&quot;</p>
<p>The Japanese government has conceded that the port practices are in need of reform, but argues that the sanctions violate international agreements.</p>
<p>Fierce resistance from the cargo handling association would make it difficult to find a solution that would satisfy the United States.</p>
<p>Japanese shippers were dismayed by the JHTA statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We'd rather that they accept international criticism as such, fix the areas that need to be fixed and proceed with talks with all the related parties,&quot; an official at a shipping firm said.</p>
<p>Japanese shippers say they are innocent victims in the dispute and have have distanced themselves from the strike, voicing concern that it could make it increasingly difficult to avert sanctions.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Maritime Commission, which plans to levy a $100,000 surcharge on Japanese shipping companies each time their vessels stop at a U.S. port from abroad, says it is only trying to create an equivalent situation to replicate the amount of damage suffered by U.S. carriers. The sanctions are due to go into effect on April 14.</p>
<p>The United States argues that a complicated system of prior consultation with the JHTA is costly and discriminatory.</p>
<p>Industry officials have estimated the surcharges would cost the three Japanese shipping firms to be affected -- Kawasaki Kisen, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. and Nippon Yusen KK -- a combined 5 billion yen ($40.9 million) per year.</p>
<p>In talks held in Washington Thursday evening, Japanese government officials repeated earlier calls for the United States to withdraw its decision to impose sanctions, saying the planned strike had made quick action difficult.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials said they believed significant progress needed to be made before the sanctions would be withdrawn.</p>
