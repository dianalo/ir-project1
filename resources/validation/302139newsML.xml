<title>USA: CSCE coffee ends lower in technically driven trade.</title>
<headline>CSCE coffee ends lower in technically driven trade.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE coffee futures ended moderately lower in chart-driven dealings Monday, as speculative long liquidation dragged prices through key support levels, traders said.</p>
<p>March delivery fell 1.15 cents per lb on the day, to close at 118.45 cents, after ranging from 119.30 to 117.00. Second-position May ended 1.00 cent lower, at 116.40 cents, while the outer months finished down 0.80 to 1.20 cents.</p>
<p>The March contract managed to breach support at 117.75-117.50 cents, touching off light sell-stops, traders said. But persistent scale-down buying by the trade trimmed losses and prevented a test of subsequent support.</p>
<p>On the charts, traders pegged March's next support at 116.50, followed by 115.25-115.00. Resistance was seen at 120.50-121.50, then 124.00.</p>
<p>Traders await the the weekly U.S. certified coffee stock figures due after today's close. Last week, the CSCE reported stocks fell by 1,607 60-kg bags in the week ended Jan. 3, to 32,458 bags.</p>
<p>They also await the Green Coffee Association of New York's monthly stock report for December slated for release after Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>Next week, traders will be looking toward Brazil, where the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) will meet Jan. 23.</p>
<p>The ACPC council is expected to address the issue of whether there is a need to cut exports by member countries in the January to June period which, under the current ACPC plan, should not exceed 26.28 million 60-kg bags.</p>
<p>Volume was moderate, at an estimated 8,360 lots.</p>
