<headline>Softs outlook-Cocoa gains favour, coffee in range.</headline>

<p>Cocoa may reach higher ground this week or at least consolidate recent gains after rallying to seven-month peaks last week and again gaining investors' favour.</p>
<p>The London market emerged from a prolonged downtrend less than two weeks ago to race higher on a spate of speculative and fund short covering.</p>
<p>Benchmark May rose to hit a peak of 1,033 stg a tonne on Friday from a low of 855 in mid-February. Traders said cocoa could gain further if reluctant grinders decided to chase the rally.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, robusta coffee is losing its shine after retracing from another blistering rally earlier last week which drove benchmark May to $1,825 a tonne, the highest since June.</p>
<p>The May contract could immediately range between a chart gap of $1,600-$1,615 on the downside and a $1,702-$1,728 gap on the upside while players keep a close watch on the roller-coaster New York futures and the May 20 meeting of key producers in London.</p>
<p>The March contract in New York expires on Tuesday but traders said they expected no fireworks.</p>
<p>Colombian truck drivers are due to meet on March 22 to decide the date for a national strike. Previous strikes disrupted coffee shipments and helped fuel the recent rally.</p>
<p>In white sugar, the market could continue to amble in a tight band on a dearth of inspiring news.</p>
<p>London's May cocoa whizzed past the 1,027 stg a tonne barrier on Friday and traders were looking for further advance due to persistent short covering, fresh buying and bouyant New York values.</p>
<p>The nearby market remained tight, suggesting prices might try higher levels.</p>
<p>But there was no change in the supply scenario while the views of some analysts that the season would end with a sizeable production deficit were already discounted in the market, traders said.</p>
<p>Some traders said the rally in New York might have been fuelled by funds shifting money out of coffee, which took a sharp downturn on Thursday, and into cocoa.</p>
<p>&quot;The money now is in the cocoa market,&quot; said one European trader.</p>
<p>Origin selling pressure had eased as the current crop was believed to have been well sold while stocks in western markets were in strong hands.</p>
<p>&quot;In no case, would I be short of this market,&quot; said one physical trader. &quot;If you are a manufacturer, you should cover for at least into the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>&quot;In the next few months during the European summer, you have to be prepared for a possible squeeze in the terminal market by strong people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Global consumption for cocoa remained brisk, including mature western markets, traders said.</p>
<p>The picture for coffee, by contrast, had turned less bullish after a prolonged rally since January.</p>
<p>Traders said the London and New York markets might continue to flirt with key support levels, although New York arabica prices ended higher on Friday after a dip to 179 cents a lb basis May.</p>
<p>Traders said a fall below the crucial 172 would trigger a drop to 150 seen in early February, in which case the long holders could be under pressure to liquidate their positions.</p>
<p>While the longer-term supply/demand outlook remained more positive as the market entered the critical Brazilian winter season in June and July, the robusta sector might be weighed down by the approaching large Indonesian harvest.</p>
<p>Attention this week will focus on Thursday's meeting of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) technical group of major growers to analyse high prices and their impact on consumption.</p>
<p>But brokers GNI said on Friday little was expected to emerge from the meeting. The policy-making ACPC council is not expected to meet until May.</p>
<p>White sugar has been largely rangebound amid a lack of fundamental news, which traders expected to continue this week.</p>
<p>&quot;The trade is generally short in both markets,&quot; one trader said, referring to London and New York. As soon as sugar goes down, it runs into buy backs, he said. &quot;There are too many looking to buy.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders were hoping funds could be tempted out and persuaded to sell the market down.</p>
<p>Some are eyeing Russia and China for buying to get the market up, but they are not optimistic. &quot;Everything's pointing bearish,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;If anything happens there could be a rush of panic buying,&quot; he said, referring to bullish fundamental news.</p>
