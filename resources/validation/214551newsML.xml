<headline>German IBIS DAX ends above crucial 2,800 level.</headline>

<p>German shares climbed to new record highs on Monday, boosted by strength in the dollar, which benefits German exporters, and gains in bourse newcomer Deutsche Telekom.</p>
<p>The German DAX index of 30 top shares ended floor trade at a record bourse level of 2,799.19 points, up 35.50 points, or 1.28 percent, just above an all-time high of 2,799.05 reached on November 15.</p>
<p>After the bourse close the DAX mounted the psychological and technical level of 2,800 points to touch a new record high in IBIS computer dealings of 2,805.75 points, before closing at 2,800.52 up 31.05 points.</p>
<p>Shares in telecommunications giant Telekom ended up three percent, or 96 pfennigs at 32.98 marks. Dealers said an initial wave of speculative profit-taking had come to an end, with the stock also recovering somewhat in Friday's New York trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Players like how the shares stablised last week and are now ready to take positions,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>The chemical and carmaker sectors were helped by the firmer dollar, which rose nearly a pfennig on its Friday closing level, firmly above 1.51 marks. After the close of share dealings the dollar rally continued above 1.52 marks.</p>
<p>Dealers said the re-entry of the Italian lira into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was also positive for German exporting stocks as it made monetary union seem more likely.</p>
<p>&quot;The entry of the lira into the ERM makes the Euro seem more like a concrete reality,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, shares in electronics giant Siemens were the only DAX stock to end bourse dealings in negative territory, falling 66 pfennigs to 70.87 marks.</p>
<p>Dealers said the stock was experiencing a delayed reaction to figures released last week at Siemens Nixdorf Informationsssysteme AG, the company's computer unit.</p>
