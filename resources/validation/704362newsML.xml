<p>Britain's new Labour government held its first talks on Thursday with writer Salman Rushdie, promising renewed efforts to end an eight-year-old Iranian threat on his life.</p>
<p>No new initiatives were revealed but Rushdie said he was &quot;delighted&quot; by the talks and supporters voiced hope that politicians across Europe might soon win progress from Tehran on free speech and human rights.</p>
<p>&quot;I was delighted by the very principled, determined and constructive spirit of the new government and I look forward to strong efforts to resolve this case in the near future,&quot; Rushdie said in a statement.</p>
<p>His support group, the International Committee for the Defence of Salman Rushdie, said the talks were the first official contact since Labour replaced the Conservative government in May's election.</p>
<p>It said both sides used the briefing to take stock of the situation and assess future chances for freedom in Iran. Protesters will press the case for human rights on Monday in a rally outside the Iranian embassy in London.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very optimistic. Across Europe, there are good, new people in place and we're very hopeful for the future,&quot; said one member of the group.</p>
<p>Rushdie is a keen Labour supporter and had often criticised the Conservatives for not doing enough to push Tehran into lifting the so-called fatwa.</p>
<p>The Indian-born British writer has lived in hiding since Iran's religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the death sentence, accusing Rushdie of blasphemy in his novel &quot;Satanic Verses&quot;.</p>
<p>Junior Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett said Britain took &quot;the threat to Salman Rushdie's life extremely seriously&quot; and was &quot;appalled that after eight years this threat persists.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue to work closely with our EU partners to maintain pressure on Iran to remove the fatwa...Iran is in no doubt that this issue stands in the way of better relations,&quot; Fatchett said in a statement.</p>
<p>While Fatchett announced nothing new, he promised &quot;an open door&quot; and close cooperation with Rushdie in a break with past Conservative policy.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to stay in close touch with Salman Rushdie. My door is always open to him,&quot; Fatchett said.</p>
<p>The last time Rushdie met a minister was in 1995 and he has voiced hope for an easier life under Labour after years of secrecy, safe houses and death threats.</p>
<p>A British official said Thursday's 45-minute meeting was at Fatchett's invitation &quot;to assure Rushdie that we will do everything we can to get this fatwa lifted.&quot;</p>
<p>The talks were very friendly and showed Fatchett's personal commitment to the cause, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;But the ball's very much in Iran's court,&quot; he said.</p>
