<p>The Italian economy, which slowed to a snail's pace in the first half of last year, grew faster than expected in the third quarter of 1996, national statistics office Istat said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Istat said Italy's gross domestic product (GDP) rose 0.7 percent year-on-year between July and September and 0.6 percent by comparison with the second quarter. Provisional data released last November pointed to a 0.5 percent increase in both cases.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase in GDP...confirms that the Italian economy is on the road to recovery,&quot; Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni said in a statement.</p>
<p>Over the first three quarters of the year, the economy grew by 0.9 percent against the same period in 1995, with the construction, agriculture and service sectors all showing gains while the industry sector declined 0.4 percent.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre-left government has forecast growth of 0.8 percent for 1996 as a whole and an Istat spokesman described this goal as realistic on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Early data has pointed to industrial output increasing in both October and November but the final quarter of the year has two fewer working days than the fourth quarter of 1995, which will depress the overall GDP figure.</p>
<p>However, Enrico Giovannini, head of the Istat department which compiles GDP data, said the 1996 target could be hit even with around zero growth in the last three months of the year.</p>
<p>This would come as a relief to the government, which has repeatedly revised its economic forecasts downwards in the face of faltering industrial production, strong lira gains and stringent Bank of Italy monetary policy at the start of 1996.</p>
