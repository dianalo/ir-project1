<p>Danish telecoms former monopoly Tele Danmark on Tuesday reported 1996 profits predictably down on the year before, as competition forced it to cut margins and increase promotional spending.</p>
<p>Publishing its 1996 annual report Tele Danmark posted a 1996 pre-tax profit of 5.067 billion crowns, down from 1995's 5.458 billion crowns but slightly better than analysts had expected.</p>
<p>The 51.73 percent state-owned company said that although increased activity in the mobile phone market helped raise turnover, tariff cuts and promotional costs in a highly competitive market reduced earnings by 140 million crowns.</p>
<p>In a statement accompanying the report, Tele Danmark said that deregulation begun last July and expected to be completed shortly would mean lost market share.</p>
<p>&quot;The liberalisation of July 1 1996 means growing competition which will result in the further loss of market share in the area of telephony,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;We therefore expect telephone charges to come under pressure with prices falling overall as a result,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The company is particularly irked by pending government price-capping of access to Tele Danmark's network by competitors which it says compels unreasonably low charges.</p>
<p>The regulatory National Telecom Agency is to announce on Wednesday the recipients of licenses for the new Danish DCS-1800 high frequency mobile telephone system.</p>
<p>Analysts expect a maximum single regional and three nationwide DCS-1800 licenses to be granted.</p>
<p>Five bidders have submitted tenders, current mobile phone operators Tele Danmark and Sonofon of Denmark, Sweden's Telia and Netcom Systems and France Telecom Mobile.</p>
<p>Despite the gloomy outlook Tele Danmark forecast an unspecified rise in net profits in 1997 from 1996's 3.104 billion crowns, helped by increased turnover and an expected fall in financial items.</p>
<p>It said that a 23 percent increase in 1996 turnover was mainly due to income from partly-owned Belgian operator Belgacom. Tele Danmark acquired a 16.5 percent stake in the semi-privatised Belgian telephone company in March 1996 .</p>
<p>&quot;The rise in turnover is mainly attributable to the fact that Belgacom figured in Tele Danmark's accounts since April 1996,&quot; Tele Danmark said, adding that Belgacom's contribution to overall group turnover last year was 3.260 billion crowns.</p>
<p>In addition, Tele Danmark said turnover in Danish business rose 771 million crowns or 4.1 percent, of which 400 million crowns was directly related to mobile telephone activities.</p>
<p>Sonofon is a key competitor to Tele Danmark in the domestic mobile telephone market. Tele Danmark said that a similar price war with lower margins on overseas telephone calls had forced income down by 210 million crowns last year.</p>
<p>It said that while increased competition had meant a 5.4 percent fall in income on overseas calls due to tariff cuts, domestic telephone calls had shown a 3.3 percent turnover rise in 1996, with an eight percent growth in traffic to and from abroad helping to offset market losses. --Copenhagen newsroom +45 33 969650</p>
