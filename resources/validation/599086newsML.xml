<title>USA: CBOT May soymeal seen focus of expiration Tuesday.</title>
<headline>CBOT May soymeal seen focus of expiration Tuesday.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT May soymeal was the trade focus early Tuesday because of the high open interest level in that contract before expiration slated for Tuesday at 1201 CDT, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The open interest came down a lot yesterday but it's still too high and there could be some fireworks in there,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The preliminary open interest in the May meal early Tuesday totaled 975 contracts which is a 1,666 drop from the start of trading early Monday, according to the CBOT.  </p>
<p>But traders said the soymeal open interest in the May should be at a more &quot;comfortable&quot; level of roughly 200 to 300 contracts.</p>
<p>No deliveries have been posted against the May and none were expected because nearby cash basis levels remain much stronger than futures. Cash soymeal brokers on Monday quoted basis levels for Chicago at $18.00 over CBOT July futures, or roughly $3.00 above CBOT May.</p>
<p>There was some potential for volatility in the May corn expiration.</p>
<p>May corn preliminary open interest early Tuesday stood at 7.075 million bushels, a 5.715-million-bushel drop from the start of trading Monday, according to the CBOT.</p>
<p>&quot;In the expiration we're looking at corn and meal for excitement,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Preliminary open interest in the May wheat early Tuesday stood at 165,000 bushels, May soyoil at 173 contracts, May soybeans at 3.180 million bushels and May oats at 545,000 bushels.</p>
