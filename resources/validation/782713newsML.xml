<p>Gerry Adams, head of the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, began his first talks on Wednesday with Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary to pave the way for his party's historic entry into peace talks.</p>
<p>The meeting between the Sinn Fein president and Mo Mowlam, the British government's Northern Ireland Minister, took place less than three weeks after Adams' IRA guerrilla allies called a halt to the war for Irish reunification.</p>
<p>Adams told reporters his party should have been in talks with the British government &quot;a long time ago&quot; because of the party's electoral showing, which has seen its share of the province's vote rise from 10 to 17 percent in seven years.</p>
<p>But Adams has been barred from contact with British, Irish and U.S. ministers because of the Irish Republican Army's 28-year war against British rule of the province.</p>
<p>Mowlam is expected to tell Adams that Sinn Fein will be allowed to take part in multi-party peace talks in September for the first time, providing the IRA ceasefire is deemed genuine and credible by the London government.</p>
<p>She will tell Adams that IRA targeting of potential victims and sites and so-called &quot;punishment beatings&quot; meted out by self-styled IRA police to wayward Catholics will be viewed as a breach of the guerrillas' July 20 ceasefire, aides said.</p>
<p>She is also expected to spell out to Adams that Northern Ireland will remain part of Britain so long as the majority, which is currently 60 percent pro-British Protestant, wants it to be and that nothing will alter that.</p>
<p>There have been no IRA bomb or gun attacks since the guerrillas called an &quot;unequivocal restoration&quot; of a broken August 1994 ceasefire last month in a bid to get Sinn Fein to the negotiating table for the first time.</p>
<p>But scenes of jubilation that greeted the first IRA ceasefire were not repeated after July 20. Mowlam said this week that the 1.5 million population was &quot;very wary and rightly so.&quot;</p>
<p>She is also keenly aware that Adams' entry into negotiations on a lasting settlement to a 28-year war which killed 3,200 may provoke his pro-British unionist foes to refuse direct talks with him until the IRA is disarmed and disbanded.</p>
<p>Adams says his goal since 1993 has been to join the talks between Protestant unionists who want the province to remain in the United Kingdom and Irish Catholic nationalists.</p>
<p>But he was barred from the talks by Britain and Ireland, co-sponsors of the negotiations, and cast into the political wildnerness until the July 20 IRA truce to its 28-year war.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland's main pro-British group, the Ulster Unionist Party of David Trimble, says it will not walk out of the negotiations but wants the IRA to hand over weapons to prove the truce is real and that its war is over for good.</p>
<p>Two smaller unionist parties walked out of the talks altogether in protest at Anglo-Irish proposals to allow guerrillas to disarm in stages as the political talks progress.</p>
<p>Adams says the IRA is sticking to its decades-old policy that &quot;not a single bullet&quot; will be surrendered until a final settlement is reached.</p>
<p>Adams' meeting with Mowlam will mark another step towards ending his vilification by successive British governments who banned his voice from the airwaves and barred him from Britain until the first IRA truce in 1994.</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister John Major once said the thought of negotiating with Sinn Fein would make him physically ill.</p>
<p>In recent weeks Adams has held talks with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and is expected to meet senior Clinton administration officials on a visit to the United States in the first week of September.</p>
