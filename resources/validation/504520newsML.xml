<p>The long-awaited exchange of ambassadors between the United States and Vietnam will help turn a page in the two countries' turbulent history of war and mutual suspicion, Vietnam's Washington ambassador-to-be said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Between the two countries there are still things we have to overcome, like the legacy of the war,&quot; Le Van Bang told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have go out and explain to people that this is the next step, and the next step will be better for both countries.&quot;</p>
<p>Bang hailed Thursday's Senate confirmation of Douglas &quot;Pete&quot; Peterson as the first U.S. ambassador to Hanoi and said it would give new impetus to relations which have moved at a glacial pace since the fanfare of normalisation two years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a great step in relations...&quot; he said. &quot;Vietnam asked the President of the United States in 1945 to recognise Vietnam and it has taken half a century to get there.&quot;</p>
<p>The prospect of Peterson, a former U.S. Air Force pilot and prisoner of war, returning as ambassador to the communist country he once fought has fired imaginations around the world.</p>
<p>But his career diplomat counterpart -- whose war contribution was as a Youth Brigade volunteer repairing roads -- has missed out on media attention.</p>
<p>After a stint at Vietnam's embassy in London from 1982 to 1986, Bang returned to become deputy director and then director of the Foreign Ministry's Americas department in Hanoi.</p>
<p>In 1993 he was made Vietnam's ambassador to the United Nations and then Charge d'Affaires at the embassy in Washington.</p>
<p>His appointment as ambassador now needs final approval from U.S. President Bill Clinton, something Bang described as a formality.</p>
<p>Bang, 50, said his biggest challenge would be to convince Americans who still associate Vietnam with the images of a war which killed more than three million people that his country has changed.</p>
<p>&quot;My challenge is to inform the American people that Vietnam is a new country, it's a potential market for American businessmen and it is a country that wants to be friends with American people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bang said he would like to see Hanoi and Washington clear the hurdles still in the way of a comprehensive trade agreement this year and hinted that Washington should soft-pedal on its demands for Vietnam to liberalise trade and investment regimes.</p>
<p>&quot;Ours is still an undeveloped country. The United States... has to see that Vietnam should be given some time to prepare,&quot; he said. &quot;Their requirements and requests might be higher than reality. Even if we agree to that, we cannot carry it out.&quot;</p>
<p>During a visit to Vietnam this week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin called on Hanoi to quicken the pace and broaden the scope of its decade-old experiment in reform along market lines.</p>
<p>Bang said that once here, Peterson could make progress on the United States' priority in Vietnam -- full accounting for the 1,588 servicemen still counted as missing in action (MIA).</p>
<p>Last year, Hanoi expressed irritation over Washington's insistence on the MIA issue, saying there were other areas of humanitarian concern in Vietnam that merited attention.</p>
