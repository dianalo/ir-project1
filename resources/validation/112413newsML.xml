<title>USA: GOLF-LOCAL FAVORITE OGRIN WIDENS LEAD AT TEXAS OPEN.</title>
<headline>GOLF-LOCAL FAVORITE OGRIN WIDENS LEAD AT TEXAS OPEN.</headline>
<dateline>SAN ANTONIO, Texas 1996-10-12</dateline>

<p>Local favourite David Ogrin, inspired by overwhelming gallery support, birdied the final hole Saturday to increase his lead to three strokes after three rounds at the Texas Open golf tournament.</p>
<p>Ogrin, who went to college in Texas and lives just outside San Antonio, began the third round with a one-shot edge on Jay Haas. Six birdies and two bogeys in a four-under-par 68 round put Ogrin at 13-under 203 after 54 holes.</p>
<p>Haas remained alone in second place, but fell three strokes off the pace at 206 after a rollercoaster 70.</p>
<p>Tommy Armour shot the day's lowest round -- a flawless 64 -- to move within four shots of the lead.</p>
<p>But rookie sensation Tiger Woods, in contention after the second round, went the other way. He slipped seven shots back after bogeying three of the first four holes en route to a 73.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old Woods won last week's Las Vegas Invitational in only his fifth start since turning professional. Ogrin, 38, is still looking for his first victory in 14 seasons on the PGA Tour. He had never led after three rounds before Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Leader by three's got a good ring to it, especially at home,&quot; he said. &quot;The longer you go in your career the more you realise how little mystery there is to winning a tournament. You shoot the lowest score.&quot;</p>
<p>Ogrin has played the LaCantera course some 50 times, which helped him remain patient.</p>
<p>&quot;You know if you keep hitting good shots the course will afford you an opportunity for birdie,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Haas stumbled with a double bogey at the par-four ninth, where his second shot struck a male spectator on the head.</p>
<p>&quot;He probably felt better than I did at the time,&quot; joked Haas, who added that the spectator did not appear seriously injured.</p>
<p>Ogrin may have the home field advantage, but Haas takes far greater experience with final-round pressure into Sunday. He has won nine times in an impressive career, including twice at the Texas Open at its previous venue.</p>
<p>&quot;David played great. He'll be tough to catch, but if I can make six or seven birdies again tomorrow I'd like to say I could do it,&quot; Haas said.</p>
