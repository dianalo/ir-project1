<p>The head of a rich but idle copper mine on the Papua New Guinea island of Bougainville said on Tuesday an abortive government attempt to use mercenaries to recapture the mine had complicated peace efforts.</p>
<p>Bougainville Copper Ltd chairman David Karpin also told company shareholders that the Port Moresby government had not followed up on a declaration that it would buy out the mine.</p>
<p>The vast Panguna copper-gold mine has been idle since rebel attacks on workers forced its closure in May 1989. It provided a third of Papua New New Guinea's foreign exchange at the time.  </p>
<p>Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan stepped aside last month after it was revealed he had hired London-based military consultancy Sandline International to help put down the rebellion and reopen the mine.</p>
<p>&quot;The appointment of Sandline added significant problems and in my belief has not advanced any potential restart of mining operations,&quot; Karpin told the company's annual general meeting.</p>
<p>Karpin also said he did not believe any military initiatives would end the crisis and said his company had been given no warning of Papua New Guinea's plan to hire the mercenaries.  </p>
<p>The company had also received no formal indication that Papua New Guinea planned to buy out the mine.</p>
<p>In early March, the Papua New government offered to buy the controlling stake in the mine from Bougainville Copper's parent company, Anglo-Australian mining giant RTZ-CRA.</p>
<p>The Australian Stock Exchange said in March it was investigating unusually large turnover in Bougainville Copper shares in mid-February, when daily turnover rose to more than 460,000 -- 10 times higher than normal for the sleepy stock, which is listed in Australia.  </p>
<p>The investigation has since been taken over by the Australian Securities Commission.</p>
<p>Karpin added the company had not been able to inspect the mine since 1990 and said a reopening would be costly as equipment lying there must have deteriorated. He said he saw no early possibility that the mine would reopen.</p>
<p>Karpin also said he would stand down as chairman and would be replaced by RTZ-CRA executive Ian Gould.</p>
