<p>- The long, exhausting presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole came to a close in the pre-dawn dampness early on Tuesday in the hometown of come-from-behind Democratic legend Harry Truman.</p>
<p>The final stop of Dole's 96-hour &quot;march to victory&quot; came before a courthouse statue of Truman, the Democrat who pulled off one of America's greatest political upsets when he defied opinion polls to defeat Republican Tom Dewey in 1948.</p>
<p>Dole, too, was hoping for an upset. The latest Reuters/Zogby poll showed him lagging behind President Bill Clinton by 7.3 points and was further behind in several other opinion surveys.</p>
<p>Several thousand people turned out in Independence to cheer Dole on a foggy, damp morning as he delivered his speech at 3 a.m. local time (0900 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;What was true for Harry Truman in 1948 will be true for Bob Dole and Jack Kemp in 1996,&quot; said the 73-year-old campaigner. &quot;The people are once again going to win this election today.&quot;</p>
<p>From Independence, Dole heads later to his hometown of Russell, Kansas, where he planned to vote at mid-day.</p>
<p>Dole's stop at the Truman statue climaxed a 96-hour, whirlwind rush through 19 states that began Friday. He kept up a breakneck pace around the clock, stopping for only a few hours of sleep in his last-ditch bid to defeat Clinton.</p>
<p>On the last day of the campaign, Dole nearly lost his voice. But in Independence, he seemed to find renewed energy and spoke strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;I recall the last time I fought round the clock for my country was in Italy in 1945,&quot; said Dole, refering to his service in the Second World War.</p>
<p>&quot;Since noon last Friday, I have been fighting around the clock for America's future,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;With every rally and every handshake, I have felt our momentum increase, particularly in the last 10 days. The tide of this election, I believe, was turned in diners and bowling alleys, in the heart of a people where the old values endure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Getting in another jab at Clinton over the ethics issue he has been underscoring in the last few weeks of the campaign, Dole said the nation &quot;deserves and demands a president worthy of its honesty, worthy of its decency, worthy of its trust.</p>
<p>&quot;I have done what I can do -- all I can do -- to make the stakes of this election, and the contrast of our visions, clear to every voter,&quot; he said.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday morning in a Des Moines, Iowa, bowling alley, Dole predicted that &quot;a lot of people are going to be surprised tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>He spoke as his aides touted as a hopeful omen the first election returns from the hamlet of Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, where the nation's first voters went for Dole 18 to 8.</p>
<p>At the bowling alley, Dole's life was summed up by Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican and onetime Navy pilot who spent years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.</p>
<p>&quot;You know Bob Dole,&quot; said McCain quietly to hundreds of Dole supporters who came to bid good luck to Dole on Election Day.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the last crusade of a great warrior, a member of a generation of Americans who went out and made the world safe for democracy so that we could have lives that were better for ourselves and our children,&quot; McCain said.</p>
<p>Dole, his right arm permanently crippled when a Nazi shell tore into it in Italy 51 years ago, stood silently by, seemingly choked up by McCain's remarks.</p>
