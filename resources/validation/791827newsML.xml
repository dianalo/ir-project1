<title>NETHERLANDS: DUTCH CLOSING DEBT MARKET REPORT.</title>

<p>Dutch bonds closed a quiet session higher with market participants preferring to focus on events later in the week and the longer term outlook.</p>
<p>Dutch state debt simply shadowed German Bunds with the yield curve resuming its flattening trend and the yield spread to Germany ending at or near day-earlier levels.</p>
<p>Dealers are keenly awaiting the Bundesbank's next repo announcement although few expect a change in German interest rates on Tuesday as the mark has rebounded against the dollar.</p>
<p>They will also monitor key U.S. economic data this week including July retail sales on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's a little better bid in thin trading,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>He said Bunds appeared to be trading sideways, trapped between 101.80 and 102.20 on the September futures contract.</p>
<p>One bond salesman said institutions were adopting a neutral strategy, unwilling to change their portfolios.</p>
<p>Fund managers said they expected the Dutch yield curve to continue to flatten over the next few months as expectations of higher short term rates depressed shorter paper in an environment of rising yields across all maturities.</p>
<p>The spread between Dutch 10 year and two year bond yields has shrunk to 175 basis points from 200 since May.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's a pause at this moment,&quot; said one fund manager, referring to the curve steepening on Friday.</p>
<p>But he said the differential could reach 140 basis points within two to three months as German interest rates were hiked to prop up the mark against the dollar.</p>
<p>He also saw the Dutch yield discount to Germany over 10 and 30 years disappearing over the same period because of the looming European single currency.</p>
<p>Rabobank International said on Monday it expected the Bundesbank to start tightening monetary policy in the next three months on confirmation of a strengtheing German economy.</p>
