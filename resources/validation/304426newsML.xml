<p>Japanese stocks rebounded sharply on Monday from last week's steep dive, with the key market average racking up a gain of more than 4.7 percent in volatile trading.</p>
<p>Brokers said the advance was a technical recovery driven by a rebound in banking shares but that the market still lacked confidence in the economy.  </p>
<p>The market's key barometer, the Nikkei average of 225 leading issues, soared 815.14 points, or 4.71 percent, to finish at 18,118.79. The Nikkei fell more than 2,000 points last week on worries about the economy and the health of financial institutions.</p>
<p>Monday's trade was volatile, with the index moving sharply in a range of more than 1,000 points. It briefly fell to 17,019.56 in the morning.</p>
<p>&quot;Since last week's fall was so sharp, the index looked attractive and bargain-hunters emerged,&quot; said Keiko Kondo, a strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan. He cautioned that the market could again be hit by companies taking profits on shareholdings ahead of corporate book closings at the end of March.</p>
<p>Brokers said that on Monday, sectors such as banking and brokerages, which were hit hard last week amid growing concern over their financial health and early profit taking before the book closings, bounced back on short covering.</p>
