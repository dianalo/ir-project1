<p>Pop singer turned actress Madonna said on Wednesday she expected to be nominated for an Oscar for her part in the film of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical &quot;Evita&quot;.</p>
<p>At a news conference ahead of the film's London premiere, the U.S. star was asked if she expected an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Argentina's Eva Peron and whether this would mean a great deal to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes and yes,&quot; Madonna replied.</p>
<p>She agreed that the film had relaunched her flagging reputation as an actress but made clear she did not intend to abandon her career as a singer.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to make another record and I'm sure I'm going to go on tour again,&quot; she said. &quot;I would rather not think of this as a reinvention, but rather as an actress playing a role in a film. I'm not sure what I'm doing next.&quot;</p>
<p>But she agreed that after a film in which she announced on set that she was about to have a baby, her next project would have to be something out of the ordinary, or at least &quot;a film where I don't get pregnant half way through the shoot&quot;.</p>
<p>She added: &quot;This is going to be a tough act to follow. It's so incredible for me in every way. So I can only say that what I am looking for next is something else incredible.&quot;</p>
<p>In October, Madonna, 38, gave birth to a daughter, Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon. The father, Carlos Leon, is the star's personal trainer.</p>
<p>Madonna, in a low-cut green and brown silk dress, appeared at the news conference with co-star Antonio Banderas, director Alan Parker, composer Lloyd Webber, actor Jimmy Nail and co-producer Andrew Vajna.</p>
<p>Madonna said she went to great lengths to clinch the part, writing to Parker and meeting him 20 times.</p>
<p>&quot;I was extremely passionate about it. I knew it was a chance for me as an actress and a singer to do things I had never done before and to push myself and to grow and I also felt that I could identify with Eva Peron on many levels,&quot; Madonna said.</p>
<p>Asked what she had in common with the actress wife of Argentine leader Juan Peron, who held power between 1946 and 1955, Madonna said:</p>
<p>&quot;She came from a small town, came from nothing essentially, and moved to the big city, and had the courage to make something incredible out of her life.&quot;</p>
