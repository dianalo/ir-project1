<p>Actor Robert Downey Jr. was sentenced on Wednesday to three years' probation, having pleaded no contest to possessing cocaine and heroin, carrying a concealed weapon, and driving under the influence of drugs.</p>
<p>Judge Lawrence Mira also ordered him to remain in a live-in drug rehabilitation programme for another three months, submit to periodic drug and alcohol tests and pay $250 in fees and restitution.</p>
<p>Mira told the Oscar-nominated actor, &quot;If you've ever had a chance here to deal with this problem and maintain your sobriety, this is the chance you're going to get.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish you good luck. You've made a good start,&quot; the judge added.</p>
<p>Downey, nominated for an Oscas for his role as Charlie Chaplin in the film &quot;Chaplin,&quot; has been in the drug rehabilitation programme for three months. Prosecutors in the case did not seek a prison term.</p>
<p>Outside the courtroom Downey's attorney, Charles English, told reporters his client &quot;couldn't be doing better, but he realises he's got a long way to go.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Downey felt bad about what happened. &quot;He feels bad that he let the public and some of his fans down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Downey pleaded no contest to the charges, California's equivalent of pleading guilty, in September. He was stopped for speeding on June 23 and police found cocaine, heroin and a pistol in the back of the pickup truck he was driving.</p>
<p>Downey was arrested again in July for entering a stranger's home in Malibu, where he was found asleep in a child's bedroom. He was back behind bars three days later for leaving a live-in drug rehabilitation centre a judge had ordered him to attend as a condition of releasing him on bail on the drug and gun charges.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old actor, son of filmmaker Robert Downey, played a cocaine addict in the 1987 movie &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; and more recently starred in such films as &quot;The Last Party,&quot; &quot;Short Cuts,&quot; &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; and &quot;Only You.&quot;</p>
