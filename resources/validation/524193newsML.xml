<title>SOUTH AFRICA: S.Africa rand/bonds closing report.</title>
<headline>S.Africa rand/bonds closing report.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1997-04-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bond yields were quoted slightly higher in late Monday trade after drifting sideways for much of the day amid a general lack of interest and direction.</p>
<p>At 1400 GMT, the key R150 was pegged at a 14.945 percent yield compared with 14.915 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>Dealers said what little activity there had been on the day happened in the morning session.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a bit of action this morning...the jobbers bought it to below 14.90 and it ran into some quite substantial offshore selling around 14.87 percent,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The selling pushed the R150 to its intraday peak of 14.96 percent before 1000 GMT and the market did little else for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Traders said that the market was waiting for the release of latest consumer inflation and money supply data later this week for confirmation of the positive signals coming from the money market.</p>
<p>The money market shortage continued to ease at the weekend, falling to 7.385 billion rand on Saturday from 7.44 billion rand.</p>
<p>Money market rates have also fallen in recent days. Leading banks all quoted their three-month NCDs rates steady at between 16.45 to 16.50 percent offered from 16.55 percent previously. The 90-day BA rate was pegged at between 15.85 and 16.05 percent.</p>
<p>Central Statistical Services releases March consumer price inflation data at 0900 GMT on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A Reuters consensus poll of economists forecast consumer inflation, due for release at 0900 GMT on Wednesday, would rise 0.7 percent month-on-month or 9.7 percent year-on-year after a 0.5 and 9.8 percent rise in February.</p>
<p>Money supply growth was expected to show a 15.04 rise from February's preliminary 15.82 percent increase and private sector credit extension growth was seen rising 16.50 percent from a previous 17.34 percent. Both will be released at 1500 GMT on Friday.</p>
<p>Dealers said that until the data was released, the market would tend to weaken. Technically, dealers said the market could move back above the 15.00 percent level in the short-term, particularly after last week's 40-basis point downward run.</p>
<p>Bond Exchange figures show foreigners were net sellers of 115.27 million rand's worth of South African bonds on Friday after selling 37.61 million rand's worth on Thursday.</p>
<p>Nominal cumulative volumes were 5.5 billion rand from 35.11 billion rand on Thursday -- settlement date.  </p>
<p>On the currency market, the rand was slightly firmer after an equally uneventful day as the local unit tracked a slightly weaker dollar.</p>
<p>At 1400 GMT, the rand was quoted at 4.4460/4490 against the dollar from 4.4505/4535 on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We opened up this morning a bit firmer on the back of the dollar/mark being a bit weaker and there has been nothing since,&quot; a trader lamented. &quot;It's been terrible.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said that flows on the day mainly consisted of offshore dollar buying and selling, with importer demand for the U.S. unit creeping in later in the day.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, traders expected much of the same and said the currency was likely to hold its recent 4.44 to 4.47 range for the rest of this week.</p>
<p>Against the crosses, the rand was last trading at 28.2262/2677 yen from 28.2759/3062 on Friday, 0.3831/3835 marks from 0.3853/3857 marks and at 7.2614/2707 against sterling compared with Friday's 7.2600/2671.</p>
