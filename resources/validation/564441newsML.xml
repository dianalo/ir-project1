<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian senator resigns, threatens revenge.</title>
<headline>Australian senator resigns, threatens revenge.</headline>

<p>Independent Australian senator Mal Colston, under police investigation over travel fraud allegations and deserted by the government, quit on Tuesday as deputy president of the parliamentary upper house.</p>
<p>But Colston, who will remain in the Senate, threatened political revenge that could wreck government reforms.</p>
<p>Colston headed off a motion by non-government parties to oust him by handing in his resignation in a brief note to Senate President Margaret Reid just minutes before Senate resumed after a five-week break.</p>
<p>&quot;I have received a letter from senator Colston resigning as deputy president and chairman of committees,&quot; Reid told the Senate. Colston was not in the chamber.</p>
<p>The Queensland senator, whose vote has been crucial to the passage of government legislation, said in two newspaper interviews he would now vote against the government which he accused of throwing him &quot;to the wolves&quot;.</p>
<p>The Liberal-National coalition government does not have a Senate majority and has relied on the support of Colston and another independent to pass legislation, including budget bills.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Howard last month withdrew his support for Colston to hold the deputy presidency and said his government would no longer accept his vote.</p>
<p>Colston, who abandoned the Labor opposition last August to become an independent, told Sydney's The Daily Telegraph he would turn against the government.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Howard said he won't accept my vote. That's fine. He just seems to forget that I can vote against his government,&quot; Colston told the newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;It just seems to me if my vote is to count, the only way now is to vote against the government,&quot; Colston added in a separate interview with The Australian newspaper.</p>
<p>Colston's decision to vote against the government comes a week before Howard's administration announces its budget for the next financial year. The Senate will vote on those budget measures later in the year.</p>
<p>Legislation needs majority support to pass the Senate and if Colston votes with Labor and other minority parties, and the second independent continues to support Howard's administration, government measures would be blocked with a 38-38 tied vote.</p>
<p>The Senate unanimously voted to appoint Labor's Sue West to replace Colston as deputy president, resuming the tradition of having the president from the ruling party and the deputy from the main opposition party.</p>
