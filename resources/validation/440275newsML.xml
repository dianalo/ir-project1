<headline>PDVSA eyes deal with giant Amerada Hess refinery.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-13</dateline>

<p>State-owned Petroleos de Venezuela subsidiary Corpoven is studying a possible supply, lease or equity deal with Amerada Hess for its large refinery on St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, according to a Venezuelan source close to the talks.</p>
<p>The refinery, the world's fifth largest with a capacity of 500,000 barrels per day (bpd), has lost money for Hess in recent years, though it reported $181 million in earnings last year, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Poor refining margins have contributed to a 12 percent loss in Hess's shares since the start of the year, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems like a good synergy,&quot; since Hess has been buying Venezuelan crude for years, the source said. The refinery has the capacity to run a wide spectrum of crudes, including Venezuela's hard-to-place heavy sour variety.</p>
<p>Corpoven and Hess have been exploring the possibilities for several months, the source said.</p>
<p>The feasability study is part of PDVSA's long-term efforts to secure more downstream outlets for its mounting crude production.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Amerada Hess declined to comment on the study.</p>
<p>The refinery was one of several built in the 1950s and 1960s to sell residual fuel to East Coast utilities, but with the decline of that market most of those shut down.</p>
<p>Hess has invested $1 billion on the plant, including an upgrade last year of its main gasoline-making unit, but returns on the investment have remained low, analysts said.</p>
<p>To make the refinery more efficient it needs several hundred million dollars more investment, a committment Hess is probably not willing to make in the current low-margin environment for the industry, analysts said.</p>
