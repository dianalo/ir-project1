<p>When Peter Woo turned his back on big business and gave up his stewardship of two family-run blue-chip companies to enter the world of Hong Kong politics, he aimed straight for the top.</p>
<p>But the odds of him fulfilling his ambition to lead Hong Kong from its handover to China next year look slim.</p>
<p>A select college of 400 China-annointed kingmakers meet on Wednesday to pick the future Chief Executive to step into colonial Governor Chris Patten's shoes when the British furl the Union Jack and leave just after midnight on June 30 next year.</p>
<p>In the first round of voting last month by the 400-member Selection Committee, Woo came third, mustering 54 votes against the 82 won by Hong Kong's former chief justice Yang Ti Liang and 206 by the front-runner, shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa.</p>
<p>Woo had trailed in popularity surveys before the vote but, undeterred by the returns or his showing in the first round of the poll, has stepped up his campaigning.</p>
<p>&quot;People have said I have done my historical part of spicing up the chief executive contest and I should withdraw now,&quot; Woo told the committee. &quot;But I have never thought of quitting.&quot;</p>
<p>Political analysts credit U.S.-educated Woo for turning what was expected to be a low-key campaign into a presidential-style election race even though the Hong Kong public won't get to choose their next leader.</p>
<p>Woo, a father of three and the youngest of the three frontrunners, is a master spin doctor.</p>
<p>His news conferences have been slick affairs -- unlike one called by a rival in which a crush of photographers caused the microphone stand to collapse. He was also the first to announce a &quot;platform&quot;, forcing the others to follow suit.</p>
<p>In 1975, Woo joined the business empire founded by his late father-in-law, shipping magnate Sir Yue-kong Pao, who was once considered Hong Kong's most prominent tycoon.</p>
<p>Woo, 50, quickly rose to the top and in 1986 took over as chairman of two pubicly listed companies in the Pao stable, Wheelock and Wharf, which are among Hong Kong's leading companies.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the territory's democracy movement, Woo is no different from the two front-runners. All are seen as wealthy conservatives who favour turning back the clock on the democratic advancements of recent years.</p>
<p>Shanghai-born Woo favours reinstating a system of appointed seats in district representative bodies after the handover, a retreat from the expansion of democracy made by Patten since 1992. He says the pace of democratisation should be gradual to ensure stability.</p>
