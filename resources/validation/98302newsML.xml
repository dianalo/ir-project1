<p>An Indian farmers' group in the southern city of Bangalore has vowed to set fire to the venue where the Miss World beauty contest is due to be staged next month.</p>
<p>&quot;We will set it ablaze. There is no way we will allow the contest to be held here,&quot; said Nanjundaswamy, head of the militant farmers' association in southern Karnataka state.</p>
<p>India, a witness to a fast growing fashion industry, will be hosting the beauty pageant for the first time after a firm owned by Hindi film superstar Amitabh Bachchan secured contracts for the event.</p>
<p>Since then various women organisations have protested against the event, saying it degraded women and would insult Indian culture. The main focus of anger is the swimsuit parade.</p>
<p>Several women's groups have also threatened mass suicide if the event is not scrapped.</p>
<p>&quot;We will burn the stage and not allow the show. If we fail, we will go ahead with our plan to commit suicide,&quot; said K.N. Sasikala, president of Mahila Jagarna (Forum to Awaken Women).</p>
<p>The groups have also complained to the local government of Karnataka, saying the event might &quot;project the glamarous image of womanhood but was an insult to a vast majority of toiling women&quot;.</p>
<p>The government of Karnataka, the home state of Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, has rejected the protests.</p>
