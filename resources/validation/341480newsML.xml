<p>General Motors Acceptance Corp, the financial services subsidiary of General Motors Corp, is raising $1 billion in its first global bond offering in order to access particularly favorable borrowing rates in the world credit markets, according to a high-level GMAC financing official.</p>
<p>GMAC has sold debt in both the domestic and international market in the past, but this is the company's first offering which simultaneously targets investors around the globe, he said.</p>
<p>The offering was priced a few minutes ago.  </p>
<p>&quot;Market conditions around the world are excellent and demand for corporate bonds is exceptional so we decided on (our first) global offering,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Previous unsecured offerings have been smaller in size,&quot; he said. &quot;Typically, global deals are larger as world investors like the liquidity of a large deal. This will become the benchmark for investors all over the world.&quot;</p>
<p>The offering of $1 billion in five-year non-callable senior unsecured notes is being joint-lead managed by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.</p>
<p>GMAC has also selected 11 underwriters from around the world as co-lead managers, the official noted.</p>
<p>The bonds will be registered in the U.S. and listed on the Luxembourg stock exchange and will trade in markets around the world, he said.</p>
