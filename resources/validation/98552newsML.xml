<p>Sydney wheat futures settled lower last week across-the-board, largely mirroring the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Devastating hail storms in the key wheat growing region of northern New South Wales and a bullish USDA wheat stock figure failed to rattle prices on the upside as a national bumper stock is still in sight.</p>
<p>Closely-watched January and March contracts settled at lows for the week of A$157.50 and A$159.50 a tonne, respectively.  </p>
<p>However, the Sydney Futures Exchange said on Friday that the recent threat of U.S. subsidies on domestic wheat has led to U.S. wheat futures trading at subsidised price levels.</p>
<p>&quot;SFE wheat futures have reflected the world export price of wheat and are currently the only true international wheat price,&quot; the exchange said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the New South Wales Grains Board said on Friday that growers who delivered malt, feed barly, sorghum and canola to its 1995/96 pools were in line for additional payments of A$30.00 a tonne  </p>
<p>The dividend for growers follows statements earlier this week by the board that estimated pool returns for the coming harvest were at a $25.00 a tonne premium to other traders.</p>
<p>Graham Lawrence, the board's managing director, said the additional pool payments would reflect low world stocks coupled with an aggressive marketing campaign and a commodity hedging programme.</p>
<p>The additional 1995/96 pool payment of A$30 a tonne will lift canola payments to A$342.00 a tonne, he said.</p>
<p>A A$20.00 a tonne lift to malt barley number one will take pool payments to A$232.00 a tonne.  </p>
<p>Also, A$20.00 increases to malt barley number two and three and feed barley number one translates into prices of A$217.00 a tonne each, while sorghum is put at up to A$187.00 a tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;Once all stocks have been cleared and pool accounts finalised, a further payment can be expected by growers in early to mid-1997,&quot; Lawrence said.</p>
<p>On a national level, the Australian Wheat Board has said it will keep a number of options open during the harvest, with the national pool staying open throughout the harvest.  </p>
<p>The AWB's latest pool price estimate, to be released at 0700 GMT (5:00 p.m. on Monday) is expected to be unchanged, at A$195.00 a tonne, basis Australian Standard White, the third highest pool price ever.</p>
