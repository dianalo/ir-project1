<p>Indonesia's President Suharto conveyed his condolences to China on Thursday over the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the official Antara news agency reported.</p>
<p>Suharto had expressed deep regret on behalf of the government and the Indonesian people at Deng's death, said State Secretary Murdiono, who is accompanying the president on a three-day state visit to Laos, Antara reported.</p>
<p>Murdiono said Suharto was shocked at the news and had sent a message to Beijing conveying his condolences. He said Suharto hoped Deng's policies would be continued by his successors.</p>
<p>&quot;The president has said the reforms carried out by Deng had brought development to the people of China, which was in line with ideals of the Chinese people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Murdiono said Suharto, who has also been subject to speculation over the state of his health and eventual succession, hoped China would continue its positive contribution to world peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>An Indonesian Defence Ministry spokesman said Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian was due to arrive in Jakarta later on Thursday from Manila for an official visit.</p>
<p>Indonesia resumed diplomatic ties with China in 1990 after severing them following a 1965 coup attempt blamed on the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), which is still officially banned.</p>
<p>Suharto was in Laos as part of a southeast Asian tour also covering Cambodia and Burma.</p>
