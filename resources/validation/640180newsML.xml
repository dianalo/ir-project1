<p>A Florida highway patrolman pulled over an Illinois man for speeding this week and discovered more than $235,000, which Gunred Johnson signed over to the state along with his truck, police said Thursday.</p>
<p>Johnson, 60, of Oswego, Illinois, was stopped for speeding Wednesday on Interstate 10, just west of Tallahassee, a department spokesman said.</p>
<p>When the trooper neared the 1994 Dodge pickup, he noticed a strong smell of fabric softener and detergent, both products used to hide the odour of illegal drugs, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Johnson allowed police to search the truck and then told police he had no idea of the source of money in plastic bags hidden in a compartment accessible through the truck's wheel well.</p>
<p>Police said Johnson told them he visited a friend in St. Augustine and was on his way to Memphis, Tennessee, to gamble.</p>
<p>Lieut. Ken Knowles, a Florida Highway Patrol spokesman, said a thorough search at police headquarters turned up $235,230 in $100, $50 and $20 bills.</p>
<p>A computer search found no outstanding warrants for Johnson, who signed the money and the truck over to police and was released. He then reportedly took a Greyhound bus to Illinois.</p>
<p>&quot;We had no reason to hold him further, so we issued him his traffic citation, which is only an infraction,&quot; Knowles said. &quot;He can mail in the fine in 30 days.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnson now owes the state of Florida $110.</p>
