<p>Manny Alexander's RBI-triple scored Carl Everett with the go-ahead run in a three-run ninth inning as the New York Mets rallied for their fourth straight win, defeating the first-place Atlanta Braves 10-7.</p>
<p>The scrappy Mets overcame a 5-3 deficit to take a 7-5 lead into the bottom of the eighth by scoring four times in the top half, but reliever Juan Acevedo surrendered the advantage on a home run by Eddie Perez and an RBI-double by Keith Lockhart.</p>
<p>New York regained the lead against Mike Bielecki (3-5) in the ninth.</p>
<p>Former Braves reliever Greg McMichael (5-6) threw one pitch to get out of the eighth and notched the win. John Franco, who was critical of Atlanta manager Bobby Cox's decision to bypass him for the All-Star Game, struck out the side in the ninth for his 21st save.</p>
<p>The Mets (49-38) moved within 7 1/2 games of the defending National League champion Braves in the East, and remained two behind the Florida Marlins in the wildcard race.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the team we're trying to chase down,&quot; said McMichael. &quot;All the games we win are important. This is where they've (the Braves) made their money, this part of the season.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We just play the game until it's over,&quot; said Mets manager Bobby Valentine.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, Chan Ho Park allowed three hits over seven innings and Mike Piazza and Tripp Cromer homered as the Los Angeles Dodgers extended their season-high winning streak to seven games with a 11-0 romp over the San Francisco Giants.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old Korean (6-5) walked one and struck out five in winning for the first time in five starts against San Francisco.</p>
<p>&quot;I really wanted to beat San Francisco,&quot; Park said. &quot;It was very important to get the second half off to a good start.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was hitting his spots and making his pitches,&quot; added Piazza. &quot;That shows that he's learning to pitch.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dodgers moved to within five games of the first-place Giants in the West.</p>
<p>At Florida, the Marlins ruined a late rally by the Philadelphia Phillies with a run in the last of the ninth to take an 8-7 victory.</p>
<p>Pinch-hitter Alex Arias's soft liner to left-centre with one out in the ninth scored Bobby Bonilla for the game-winner.</p>
<p>Arias, who is 7-for-12 as a pinch-hitter this season, looped a 2-1 pitch into shallow left-centre as Florida broke a three-game losing streak.</p>
<p>&quot;You've got to be patient in that situation,&quot; said Arias. &quot;I went up there looking for a fastball I can handle. I was not going to swing at a breaking pitch.&quot;</p>
<p>Philadelphia had tied the game in the ninth with two runs against closer Robb Nen, who blew his sixth save in 30 opportunities. The Phils had drawn within striking range with three runs in the eighth as they overcame a 7-2 deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;I commend these guys for their effort,&quot; said Phillies manager Terry Francona. &quot;We were down, but put ourselves in the position to win.  We were one hit away.  We're learning, and sometimes that's hard.&quot;</p>
<p>Philadelphia (24-62) owns the worst record in the majors and have lost 21 of its last 23 games.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Darryl Kile pitched a six-hitter for his third shutout of the season and Craig Biggio went 4-for-4 with three RBI as the Houston Astros blanked the Pirates 7-0.</p>
<p>Kile (11-3) walked two and struck out seven.</p>
<p>It was Biggio's 16th career four-hit game and helped move the Astros into a first-place tie with the Pirates in the National League Central.</p>
<p>Jason Schmidt (4-5), coming off consecutive complete games, was tagged for seven runs and nine hits in four-plus innings. He had allowed seven runs in his previous four outings combined.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Gary Gaetti capped a 4-for-4, three-RBI day with a homer in the ninth, his second of the game, to lift the St. Louis Cardinals to a 3-2 victory over the Chicago Cubs.</p>
<p>Alan Benes (8-7) allowed two runs and five hits over eight innings to earn the win as the Cardinals snapped a four-game losing streak. He walked five and struck out six.</p>
<p>Dennis Eckersley pitched a hitless ninth for his 19th save.</p>
<p>Gaetti had an RBI single in the first inning and a solo homer in the third before blasting the game-winning homer in the ninth off reliever Turk Wendell (2-4).</p>
<p>&quot;Gaetti gets paid to hit and I get paid to pitch,&quot; Wendell said. &quot;He won the battle, hitting my slider for a homer.&quot;</p>
<p>At Colorado, Ken Caminiti hit a pair of three-run homers and drove in six runs as the San Diego Padres handed the Colorado Rockies their seventh straight loss, 11-5.</p>
<p>Caminiti homered in the first to stake the Padres to a 3-0 lead and added his eighth homer in the fourth as San Diego opened an 8-3 advantage.</p>
<p>Andy Ashby (5-5) allowed five runs and nine hits in six innings to notch the victory for the Padres, who won for the 200th time under manager Bruce Bochy.</p>
<p>John Burke (2-5) took the loss.</p>
