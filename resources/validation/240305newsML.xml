<p>Swedish forestry groups Munksjo AB and Sodra Skogsagarna expect to be able to raise bleached softwood pulp prices by $50 a tonne on Monday, the companies told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Stone Container in the U.S. announced that they will raise prices by 50 dollars and more U.S. companies are on their way to increase prices,&quot; said the president of Munksjo pulp mill Aspa Bruk, Bengt Unander-Scharin.</p>
<p>&quot;It is likely that we will follow with a similar increase,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sodra's head of marketing, Hans Burmeister, said Sodra is also likely to raise prices on Monday.</p>
<p>The hike will bring pulp prices to between 610 and 620 dollars a tonne, Unander-Scharin said, adding that he thinks the price increase comes too early.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this is one week too early,&quot; he said. &quot;I would have liked to have first seen inventory levels for November, which will be released next week.&quot;</p>
<p>But if this price increase is accepted by buyers, Unander-Scharin expects more to follow.</p>
<p>&quot;If this hike is seen through, there will probably be a certain momentum,&quot; he said. &quot;If it is not accepted, there is a certain risk for a decline in prices.&quot;</p>
<p>Many companies, including Sodra, are losing money at current price levels.</p>
