<headline>UK's CWS says gets substantial Regan settlement.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain's Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) said on Monday it had accepted a &quot;substantial sum&quot; in settlement of its civil claim for damages against Andrew Regan, two other men and two companies involved in the failed takeover bid for the mutually owned group.</p>
<p>CWS said civil proceedings against former CWS manager Allan Green, Regan, David Lyons, Regan's Lanica Trust and special bidding firm Galileo Group had ended but this did not affect the private prosecutions it had begun for the alleged theft of its documents.  </p>
<p>Late last month Galileo, an offshoot of Regan's Guernsey-based investment trust Lanica, was wound up after a 1.2 billion pound ($2 billion) bid attempt on the 153-year-old supermarkets-to-funeral parlours group collapsed under legal pressure from the Co-op and the withdrawal of a key financial backer.</p>
<p>CWS had said it would pursue those involved in the disclosure of confidential information by Green to Regan and Lyons. A British High Court judge had earlier described these actions as a &quot;gross, wilful and disgraceful breach of confidence&quot;.</p>
<p>In a separate statement Lanica said terms of the settlement were confidential but no admission had been made that CWS suffered any loss or damage. It said Lanica had not been required to contribute and had no financial exposure as a result of the action except for minimal legal costs.</p>
<p>Lanica said Regan and Lyons intended to &quot;vigorously&quot; contest the private prosecution proceedings against them. It also said it would shortly announce the date on which its audited results for 1996 would be published and that its listing would be restored at this time. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)</p>
