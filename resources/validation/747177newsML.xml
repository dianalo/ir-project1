<p>The European Commission stood firm on Tuesday in its determination to block Boeing Co's merger with McDonnell Douglas on Wednesday, with virtually no chance that the U.S. aircraft giant could meet its competition concerns.</p>
<p>But German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel hoped that a prohibition would be avoided, expressing fears this would cause a trade war with the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot in any case let a trade war happen just because the concerned parties have little notion of reality,&quot; Kinkel told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is possible that something happens so that this Commission decison does not have to happen&quot;, he said. He added that he had discussed the issue with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by telephone on Monday and European Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.</p>
<p>Kinkel was speaking on the sidelines of a regular meeting of EU foreign ministers.</p>
<p>Nothing seemed to be able to stop the Commission, however, which received twice the unanimous support of national antitrust experts for its plan to block the merger on the grounds it would damage fair competition in the 15-nation bloc.</p>
<p>European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert, which opposed the deal from the start, needs only a majority of the 20-member Commission to win the vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Some European antitrust lawyers have speculated that the Commission may agree on a cautious statement saying that the merger cannot be allowed in its present form, leaving the door open for Boeing to refile a modified agreement at a later stage.</p>
<p>The climate on the two sides of the Atlantic has become very confrontational over the merger, with the U.S. Congress mounting a political and trade battle and French President Jacques Chirac claiming the merger is &quot;extremely dangerous&quot;.</p>
<p>But a report in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday hinted Boeing and McDonnell Douglas would not openly challenge an EU ban, saying they may delay a shareholders meeting which was expected to give the merger the final go-ahead on Friday. No one was available for comment at the two companies.</p>
<p>Boeing and the Commission have not held any substantive talks since last week, an EU source said on Tuesday, despite the presence in Brussels since Friday of Boeing's executive vice-president Richard Albrecht.</p>
<p>Asked if Boeing still had a chance to win a reprieve, the EU source said, &quot;In 24 hours you can do a lot of things, but you can't disregard legal procedures.&quot;</p>
<p>He said it would be difficult for Van Miert to reverse his plan to ban the merger before Wednesday since he would have to draft a new text and send it to senior Commission officials and the EU national antitrust experts for review.</p>
<p>The Commission believes the deal would strengthen Boeing's already dominant position in the commercial sector, a conclusion rejected by the manufacturer, which argues McDonnell Douglas no longer constitutes a serious competitor.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas's strength in the military sector, also causes the Commission to fear that Boeing would benefit from defence funds to subsidise its commercial programmes.</p>
<p>But the most contentious point remains the exclusive supply contracts signed with large U.S. airlines AMR Corp's American Aitlines, Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines.</p>
<p>The source said there had been some progress during talks between the two sides, but that &quot;As long as there is not an agreement on everything, there is no agreement at all.&quot;</p>
<p>The Commission's determination to block the merger has triggered a barrage of sharp criticism on the other side of the Atlantic and President Bill Clinton warned the United States might go to the World Trade Organisaton or impose sanctions if this happened.</p>
<p>The EU executive has the power to block the deal if it finds it would harm fair competition in the 15-nation bloc. Were Boeing to go ahead with the merger regardless, it could impose fines up to 10 percent of the companies' turnover.</p>
