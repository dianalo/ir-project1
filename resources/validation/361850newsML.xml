<p>Has a massive four-year rally in the New Zealand dollar hit the wall?</p>
<p>Most economists suggest that the &quot;kiwi&quot; dollar is overvalued -- some say by up to 15 percent -- and that it will at least partially retrace before resuming any climb.</p>
<p>Certainly, politicians want the kiwi lower to relieve pressure on exporters and the tradeable sector so the economy can grow more rapidly to create more jobs.</p>
<p>Even Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash, who has used the rising exchange rate to counter domestic inflation pressures, has commented recently that the New Zealand dollar is near the top of its cycle and noted that the exchange rate can't go on rising indefinitely.</p>
<p>POLITICIANS WANT LOWER EXCHANGE RATE</p>
<p>New Zealand First party leader Winston Peters railed against the &quot;high&quot; exchange rate during the campaign for last October's general election. But since his appointment last month as Treasurer in a new centre-right coalition government, he has been more muted, saying it is the speed of the currency's rise rather than the rise itself which is of most concern.</p>
<p>Opposition Labour finance spokesman Michael Cullen has called for parliament to resume early to debate the &quot;exchange rate crisis&quot;.</p>
<p>He welcomed the recent retreat of the kiwi, but said the fact remained the New Zealand dollar was still overvalued.</p>
<p>New Zealand faced &quot;gutting&quot; its tradeable sector, he said, warning that if the currency did depreciate sharply then it would threaten the Reserve Bank's inflation targets. Unless monetary policy was supported by other measures, the bank would be forced to tighten monetary conditions again, he said.</p>
<p>But some economists are wary of the kiwi's doomsayers, saying many of the same reasons for its rise are still intact -- strong economic fundamentals, high real interest rates and tight monetary conditions.</p>
<p>9-1/2 YEAR HIGH</p>
<p>On its Trade-Weighted Index (TWI), which measures it against a basket of major currencies, the New Zealand dollar this month rose to a 9-1/2 year high of 68.88, 28 percent above its level four years ago.</p>
<p>Against the U.S. dollar, the kiwi has taken a sharp dip in the past fortnight to be near a 5-1/2 month low, but is still 36 percent above its level of four years ago.</p>
<p>Based on expectations for a gradual rise in world interest rates in 1997 and assuming no near-term deterioration for New Zealand's inflation outlook, ANZ Bank Chief Economist Paul Stewart expects the New Zealand dollar in trade-weighted terms to depreciate by around five percent by mid-1997.</p>
<p>The differential between New Zealand three-month interest rates and those of other dollar bloc countries had declined to two percent from around four percent last September.</p>
<p>&quot;That gap is now close to levels prevailing in 1994 and 1995 and any further narrowing is likely to significantly reduce capital inflows into New Zealand dollar interest rates,&quot; Stewart said.</p>
<p>There were huge capital inflows via eurokiwi and samurai issues last year -- estimated at more than NZ$5 billion -- as retail investors took advantage of New Zealand's high interest rates.</p>
<p>The influential U.S. investment house Goldman Sachs said last week that the New Zealand dollar was overvalued.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the kiwi is overvalued by 15 percent,&quot; it said in its weekly report, adding that it was cautiously adopting a negative stance towards the curency.</p>
<p>&quot;There is certainly nothing attractive about the kiwi. The economy is slowing down, inflation is coming down, Japanese capital in-flow has probably stopped and New Zealand policy makers all seem to want the currency lower,&quot; Goldman said.</p>
<p>But Goldman admitted it has been wrong on the kiwi before.</p>
<p>In 1995 and 1996 it published a series of bearish reports on the currency. It recommended in late 1995 that investors of New Zealand dollar assets cover their currency exposures. That was when the TWI was at 61.8 against its present level of 68.2.</p>
<p>Goldman and others were wrong because the New Zealand economy did not come off the boil as quickly as expected, inflation pressures were more persistEnt than predicted and Brash responded by keeping monetary conditions tighter than had been anticipated.</p>
<p>HISTORY MAY BE REPEATED</p>
<p>The National Bank of New Zealand is of the school that thinks history could repeat itself.</p>
<p>&quot;The risks are that you could see more appreciation before it comes down,&quot; said National's Treasury Economist Kevin Smit.</p>
<p>He said that although on a purchasing power parity analysis the currency was looking toppish and there were some stresses -- notably on current account deficit -- his bank believes interest rate differentials between New Zealand and its trading partners may not close in 1997 as much as some people expect.</p>
<p>&quot;If the inflation view becomes less optimistic, particularly for 1998, as a consequence of significant increases in government spending, then that would impact on policy settings through the course of 1997 and have some feed-through into the exchange rate,&quot; Smit said.</p>
<p>He admits the current account deficit, which for the year to September reached 4.6 percent of GDP, is getting to a point where it could cause concern. But he said December quarter merchandise trade figures were encouraging, with the deficit half that of the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Smit said the Reserve Bank had not factored into its forecasts the $5 billion of extra spending planned by the new centre-right government over the next three years or a higher minimum wage rate.</p>
<p>&quot;Once it does that, that may start to signal the inflation outlook for 1998 is not as optimistic as previously thought and that would alter expectations about how much monetary conditions can ease over the course of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The window for easing may end up being only a very small one,&quot; Smit said. &quot;In the meantime the potential is that the currency may go a little higher rather than necessarily falling.&quot;</p>
