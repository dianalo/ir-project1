<p>A third Colombian prison fell under control of rebellious inmates on Monday amid a growing wave of protests against overcrowding and poor living conditions that began with the killing of four guards last Thursday.</p>
<p>Police and penal authorities said the latest riot occurred in the Modelo prison in Bucaramanga, capital of northern Santander province and the site of frequent clashes between the military and leftist National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels.</p>
<p>Television footage from Bucaramanga showed scores of inmates, many of them waving ELN banners, standing on the roof of the Modelo shouting demands for better living conditions, sentence reductions and an end to chronic overcrowding.</p>
<p>The riot at the Modelo, which houses more than 1,200 inmates, was the third to rock the facility in the past 1 1/2 months and followed last week's bloody uprising at the main jail in Valledupar, capital of northern Cesar province, where four guards were shot and killed on Thursday.</p>
<p>Another riot erupted over the weekend at the Barne prison in central Tunja province where at least one guard has been held hostage since Saturday.</p>
<p>A standoff between hundreds of police and soldiers, backed by two light tanks, and the more than 550 prisoners in Valledupar continued on Monday with no sign of a settlement any time soon.</p>
<p>The government has said it will refuse to hold any negotiations with the Valledupar rioters, said to be led by a group of 10 men headed by a suspected leftist guerrilla, unless they release 15 hostages being held inside the facility and lay down the large cache of weapons they seized from prison guards.</p>
<p>The rioters, in turn, have demanded parachutes, bullet proof vests and helicopters to escape and some have reportedly demanded political asylum in Cuba.</p>
<p>At least nine Colombian prisons have been torn by riots over the past two months but Thursday's bloodshed in Valledupar was the worst in recent memory.</p>
