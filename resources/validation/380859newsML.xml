<p>The United States said on Saturday that a critical mass had been reached at talks on a deal opening up the booming telecommunications trade to competition in a big boost to the industry and the information superhighway.</p>
<p>With just hours before the midnight Geneva deadline (2300 GMT) for the talks, U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Jeffrey Lang told reporters &quot;the U.S. saw a critical mass now reached&quot;, implying Washington was ready to sign up to a deal.</p>
<p>But Lang, who has led Washington's team to the World Trade Organisation-sponsored negotiations, cautioned that other countries would have to maintain their offers as they stood and not introduce any changes before Saturday's deadline.</p>
<p>After months of playing hard, Washington eased its stance on Friday when Lang signalled the U.S., the world's biggest telecoms market and vital for an accord, was ready to sign up.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said a deal was essentially cut.</p>
<p>&quot;Essentially we have a deal,&quot; he told a news conference. Further talks would fill in &quot;final details and formalities.&quot;</p>
<p>On Friday, Lang said: &quot;We have a good possibility of success. We're making progress and can see the way forward.&quot;</p>
<p>The new pact would boost the $600 billion telecoms industry, already one of the most dynamic in the world, according to the United Nations International Telecommunications Union (ITU).</p>
<p>An ITU survey predicted on Friday that world revenues from the industry, including that from equipment, could almost double to more than $1.2 trillion by the year 2000 if a deal is struck.</p>
<p>Brittan said the pact would slash telephone costs for ordinary people and businesses around the globe, speed up the digital revolution and boost the two-year-old WTO.</p>
<p>&quot;A WTO deal on telecoms services today will give a powerful lift to the globalisation of telecoms markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition to what this deal will do for the telecoms industry, it is a major step also in the creation of the information society.&quot;</p>
<p>Washington walked away from a deal last year, saying offers, particularly from emerging nations, were not good enough.</p>
<p>This time round, it has strongly criticised Canada's offer restricting foreign ownership in domestic telecoms companies.</p>
<p>A U.S. official said there had been intensive discussions overnight with the Canadian negotiators, but there was no indication of the outcome of these talks.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. announced on Friday that it would add curbs on satellite transmission of some television and audio services to its offer on the table, other trading powers made clear they were still ready for an accord.</p>
<p>Trade diplomats said the restrictions were primarily aimed at Ottawa.</p>
<p>WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero has set success in the talks, left over from the 1986-93 Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations, as top priority for the fledgling body.</p>
<p>Brittan said the newly-announced U.S. restrictions -- applying to one-way satellite transmissions of some television services and digital audio services -- violated Washington's commitments under the Uruguay Round accords.</p>
<p>Although the EU had been assured that the curbs -- which he said were not of great significance -- would not be applied to European entrants to the U.S. telecom market, Brussels would reserve its right to a possible challenge in the WTO.</p>
