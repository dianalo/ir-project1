<title>AUSTRALIA: Olympics-Key Sydney Olympic official sues politician.</title>

<p>Sydney's second most powerful 2000 Olympic Games organiser on Friday began defamation action against the politician who controls the finances that are paying for the bulk of Games facilities.</p>
<p>The court case involved a dispute surrounding the introduction of a bed tax in Sydney, an issue that has badly strained relations between Games organisers and the local New South Wales (NSW) government in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Before the tax row flared last month, the International Olympic Committee praised the working relationship between the two bodies as a blueprint for future Games.</p>
<p>John Coates, senior vice-president of the Games organising body SOCOG, has sought damages against NSW state treasurer Michael Egan in a public falling out between the two officials.</p>
<p>&quot;I have already sought an apology and an apology was not forthcoming, so my lawyers served a statement of claim on the treasurer which seeks damages,&quot; Coates told reporters on Friday at a media briefing on preparations for the Games.</p>
<p>In a written statement to the New South Wales Supreme Court, Coates said Egan defamed him in June by suggesting his opposition to the bed tax was motivated by his business links with a company that runs a city hotel.</p>
<p>Coates has said he opposes the bed tax because it will have an adverse effect of Sydney's capacity to host the 2000 Games.</p>
<p>Under the bed tax scheme, which will be introduced in September, all hotels in central Sydney will be levied a 10 percent tax on rooms.</p>
<p>SOCOG has sought guaranteed access to hotel beds in the city to provide accommodation for IOC officials and sponors during the Games. Since the tax dispute began, the hotel industry has suspended their negotiations, leaving SOCOG with a massive potential accomodation shortfall.</p>
