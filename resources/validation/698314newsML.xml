<p>British health and technology group Amersham International Plc stunned the markets on Tuesday by pulling off a second major merger deal in the space of a month.</p>
<p>The company said it would merge with Norwegian group Nycomed ASA, forming a world leader in the fast-growing field of diagnostic technology, including traditional X-rays and a revolution in use of ultrasound.</p>
<p>The agreement, which sent shares in both companies racing ahead, follows hard on the June 10 announcement that Amersham was to combine its drug test equipment arm with Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Inc's Pharmacia Biotech to carve out another world-leading position.</p>
<p>The merger with Norway's Nycomed, which used to be part of combined drugs and energy company Hafslund Nycomed, will create a company with annual sales of 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) and operating profits of 244 million pounds.</p>
<p>Analysts said the merger came as a surprise, but could significantly enhance the earning power of the combined business, perhaps by as much as one third in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;This makes absolutely perfect sense,&quot; said Kleinwort Benson analyst Stuart Harris.</p>
<p>Shares in Amersham soared to a new high of 18.50 pounds in early trade before settling back to close at 17.00, up 105 pence. The stock has risen by almost 50 percent since the start of the year. In Oslo, Nycomed A shares jumped by 20 percent at one stage as buyers used the cheaper Nycomed stock to buy into the new company.</p>
<p>The A shares ended 24.50 Norwegian crowns higher at 132.50 crowns.</p>
<p>The new company, Nycomed Amersham Plc, will have its headquarters in the UK, with shares listed in London, Oslo, New York and Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Although presented as a merger, analysts in London said Amersham appeared to have the upper hand with the key post of chief executive officer going to Amersham's highly-rated chief executive Bill Castell, and Amersham's Andrew Allner continuing as finance director. Nycomed chairman Johan Fredrik Odfjell was named chairman of the combined group.</p>
<p>Amersham said only 250 to 300 jobs would go from the 11,500 strong workforce, mainly in sales and administration, with annual costs savings of 40 million pounds targeted over three years.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Nycomed shareholders will be offered shares representing 53 percent of the new company, with Amerhsam holding 47 percent. Nycomed shareholders, who are expected to back the deal, will also receive a special dividend of 5.62 Norwegian crowns per share.</p>
<p>Amersham's Castell told Reuters the goal was to become world leader in the fast-expanding field of diagnostics. Ultrasound techniques, which are already used to provide images of unborn babies, are being developed by Nycomed to provide speedy and simple diagnosis of diseases in areas such as the liver, heart and kidneys, where x-rays can be harmful.</p>
<p>Analysts said the technique, in which small bubbles are injected into the body, still has to prove its worth, but Nycomed Amersham said the market could be worth one billion pounds by 2005.</p>
<p>Nycomed's strength in ultrasound will be added to Amersham's existing position in cardiology, where its heart-imaging agent Myoview is seeing rapid growth in sales, and allow the new company to offer a one-stop shop for hospitals wanting nuclear, ultrasound and traditional X-ray technology. The Norwegian group also has a small pipeline of new conventional drugs.</p>
