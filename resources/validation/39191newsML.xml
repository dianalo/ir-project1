<p>Malaysia's blue-chip conglomerate Sime Darby Bhd on Saturday reported its ninth year of record profit, with pretax earnings above the 1.0 billion ringgit ($400 million) mark for the second year.</p>
<p>The results were above market forecasts, with the group overcoming weak performances from its Hong Kong and Singapore divisions.</p>
<p>Sime has interests ranging from banking to cars and properties to plantations. In addition to Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore, it has operations in the Philippines and Australia.</p>
<p>The company reported a pretax profit of 1.33 billion ringgit for the year ended June 30, 1996, up 31 percent from 1.01 billion last year.</p>
<p>Analysts had forecast a pre-tax profit of between 1.10 billion and 1.20 billion ringgit.</p>
<p>Group net profit rose 20 percent to 682.5 million ringgit on a 15 percent higher turnover of 10.78 billion ringgit.</p>
<p>It declared earnings per share of 30.4 Malaysian cents against 27.4 cents last year.</p>
<p>&quot;As in the past, the diversity of the group's activities has enabled it to sustain growth for the ninth year running,&quot; Sime said in a statement announcing its earnings.</p>
<p>Sime's financial services division showed the highest growth, helped by completion of the 60 percent acquisition of Malaysia's fourth biggest banking group, United Malayan Banking Corp Bhd (UMBC). Its insurance business also benefited from the strong Malaysian economy, the company said.</p>
<p>The financial services division's pretax profit surged to 329.5 million ringgit from 22.6 million the previous year.</p>
<p>Other divisions that did well include plantations and property development.</p>
<p>In both Hong Kong and Singapore, poorer vehicle sales affected its bottom line, the company said. ($1 = 2.49 ringgit)</p>
