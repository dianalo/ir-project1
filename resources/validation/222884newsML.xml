<p>Scientists are beginning to learn more about the role genetics play in anxiety, focusing on the subtle differences in a gene that can shape behaviour.</p>
<p>A team of researchers at the National Institutes of Health reports in Friday's edition of the journal Science that variants of a gene may affect how disposed someone is toward anxiety.</p>
<p>The gene variant in question is only one of an estimated dozen anxiety-related genes, and the authors of the report stress that genetics are only a factor, and that environment and life experiences also play pivotal roles.</p>
<p>&quot;Variance in personality traits, including those related to anxiety, is thought to be generated by a complex interaction of environmental and experiential factors with a number of gene products involving distinct brain systems,&quot; Dr. Dennis Murphy and his colleagues wrote in the journal.</p>
<p>The variants in genes are not the flaws or abnormalities known as mutations. Rather they are slight differences, known as alleles, similar to the differences in genes that control eye and hair colour.</p>
<p>Long alleles produce more of a protein involved with controlling a brain chemical, serotonin. Short ones make less of it. The people with short alleles score higher on psychological tests score higher on tests measuring neuroticism, the researchers found.</p>
<p>It is too soon to know whether the finding will lead to new drugs but Murphy said in an interview it should be a useful piece of information for researchers trying to develop new therapies.</p>
