<p>A buoyant Australian share market locked in solid gains by the close on Wednesday after Wall Street surged and local markets comfortably digested March quarter inflation figures.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index climbed 24.7 points to 2,472.3.</p>
<p>With a big rally in the Dow, stronger base metals prices and a consumer price index (CPI) that confirmed a low inflation environment, the market settled comfortably higher by noon and spent the rest of the day tethered to a narrow six point range.</p>
<p>&quot;It looked solid all day after the States gave us the initial lead,&quot; said a dealer at a Sydney brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;CPI didn't cause much of a fuss. We finished off the highs but it was never going to hold it all.&quot;</p>
<p>Trade was strong with two-way business across the board the driving factor rather than interest in individual stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been a pretty quiet day, even though turnover was healthy. There hasn't been anything that has been too enthralling,&quot; said dealer Scott Healey of brokerage Wilson HTM.</p>
<p>Aluminium producer Comalco Ltd was one feature, up 4.4 percent to A$6.70 (US$5.23), after it forecast an improved 1997 result.</p>
<p>Macquarie Bank also caught the eye, leaping 5.5 percent to close at a record high A$9.60 as investors viewed the fees the investment bank was likely to earn from its role in the A$4.86 billion Loy Yang A power privatisation in Victoria.</p>
<p>West Australian regional Bankwest closed up one at A$2.53 after its full year net profit of A$94.5 million.</p>
<p>Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about eight to five, while about 28 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
<p>(A$1=US$0.78)</p>
