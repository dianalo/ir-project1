<p>Britain may need to raise interest rates before the next general election to prevent its economy overheating, Bank of England governor Eddie George said in a French newspaper interview published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A rise before the election, due by mid-May, cannot be ruled out because the economy is expanding through consumption, which is raising the inflationary alarm of increased money supply.</p>
<p>&quot;For the fifth year in a row, we are seeing the economy grow solidly. Unemployment is down and inflation is lower than it has been for a generation,&quot; George told Le Figaro daily.</p>
<p>&quot;But we also notice a return of expansion through consumption, which is demonstrated by the strong growth in money supply. To contain this growth it will be necessary at some point or other to raise interest rates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked whether this might be before the next election, George said, &quot;I do not exclude it.&quot;</p>
<p>British interest rates were last raised by a quarter percentage point to six percent on October 30.</p>
<p>But the government is under mounting pressure to consider a further increase to bring the rate of underlying inflation towards its medium-term target of 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, has stuck at 3.3 percent year-on-year for the past two months.</p>
<p>Minutes of an October 30 meeting between George and Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) Kenneth Clarke, released on Monday, showed that George was already warning that rates might have to rise again.</p>
<p>Analysts said the minutes suggested the governor would be pushing for further increases in coming months.</p>
<p>Dealers in the City of London said on Tuesday that George's latest remarks in Le Figaro might dampen enthusiasm for gilts, British government bonds.</p>
<p>Gilts were unchanged in early dealings today, but largely weathered the rate warning contained in the October 30 minutes released on Monday.</p>
<p>Clarke's ruling Conservative Party, lagging badly in opinion polls and now deprived of its parliamentary majority, would be loath to raise rates again.But economists say the figures make a pre-election rise look increasingly likely to keep inflation down.</p>
<p>Unemployment plunged by nearly 96,000 in November, the largest monthly fall on record. Retail sales rose by a larger than expected 0.7 percent and M4 broad money supply growth leaped to 10.8 percent year-on-year, from 10.3 in October.</p>
<p>At the October 30 meeting, Clarke restated his commitment to meeting the inflation target, so a further rate increase is possible, analysts said.</p>
