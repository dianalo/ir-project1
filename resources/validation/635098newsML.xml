<title>SLOVENIA: Slovenian shares slip, seen biding time.</title>
<headline>Slovenian shares slip, seen biding time.</headline>
<dateline>LJUBLJANA 1997-06-03</dateline>

<p>Slovenian shares ended marginally in negative territory on Tuesday as investors and traders continued to huddle on the sidelines amid a lack of trading incentives.</p>
<p>The SBI index fell 0.38 percent or 4.99 points to 1,316.04. Overall 11 shares fell, three rose and one was flat, while 13 were untraded. Turnover rose to 91.3 million tolars from 44.8 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Ratification of the association accord with the EU has already been factored in to prices so it may only move the index by a few percent,&quot; said Andrej Potocnik, a trader at brokerage BPH.</p>
<p>But non-ratification could hammer the blue-chip index down by about 20 to 30 percent in the short term.</p>
<p>Parliament is expected to vote on whether to ratify the association agreement next week.</p>
<p>Food processing company Kolinska was the most actively traded share, firming 1.29 percent to 1,965 tolars on volume of 13,162 shares for total turnover of 25.8 million tolars.</p>
<p>Health resort operator Terme Catez led the day's decliners and fell 5.36 percent or 680 tolars to 12,000 tolars. Traders said today's fall was a correction to last week's gains. But turnover was low at just 15 shares.</p>
<p>Port operator Luka Koper eased 0.51 percent to 1,761 tolars on volume of 1,565 shares and brokers said the fall was due to selling from small shareholders, who received shares in exchange for the company's privatisation vouchers.</p>
<p>Bank UBK was the top gainer, jumping 8.61 percent to 8,200 tolars on volume of 33 shares. Demand continued to be high on the back of last week's announcement that Slovenia's second largest bank SKB was buying a 51 percent stake of UBK in June.</p>
<p>&quot;The announced merger significantly boosted interest for UBK's shares -- I think UBK could rise to approximately 15,000 to 20,000 tolars before the merger takes place,&quot; Potocnik said.</p>
<p>Bank SKB eased 0.39 percent to 49,000 tolars on volume of 68 shares.</p>
