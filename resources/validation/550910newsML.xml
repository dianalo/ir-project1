<p>Chelsea Clinton, the only child of President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, has for most of her life escaped the harsh media spotlight trained on her parents.</p>
<p>At the White House and at the Arkansas governor's mansion before that, the Clintons have done everything to shelter their daughter from scrutiny, and the same principle applied to their announcement on Wednesday that she will go to college at Stanford University in the autumn.</p>
<p>The White House announced the decision in a one-sentence statement and aides, intent on protecting the 17-year old's privacy, declined to answer questions about why she chose the highly-respected private university in Palo Alto, California.</p>
<p>The media for the most part has acceded to the Clintons' request that they respect Chelsea's privacy as a student at Washington's Sidwell Friends School, an elite private school that she has attended for the past four and a half years.</p>
<p>On those rare occasions where Chelsea has spent time with reporters, including during vacations with her mother to central Europe, Africa and South Asia, she has impressed them as personable, intelligent, quick-witted and outgoing.</p>
<p>In New Delhi, India, in 1995, Chelsea brought a group of reporters outside a museum to show them a carriage that gave the English language the word &quot;juggernaut.&quot; Used to carry statues of gods from village to village, the carriage would often go out of control, crushing all in its path.</p>
<p>On the Africa trip, she was more serious, telling teenagers that her generation must overcome the temptation to succumb to cynicism and hopelessness. In August 1996, Chelsea was at her father's side during a whistlestop train trip with which he began his re-election campaign and eagerly plunged into the political ritual of shaking hands with voters.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday night her daughter was interested in a medical career, a course of study for which Stanford is acclaimed. In the United States, students wishing to become physicians take &quot;pre-med&quot; courses as undergraduates before going on to four-year medical school programmes.</p>
<p>Chelsea visited a variety of Ivy League schools before making her college decision, including Harvard University in Boston, Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.</p>
<p>Chelsea has a keen interest in dance and has taken ballet lessons during her stay at the White House and taken part in annual Christmas performances of the Nutcracker ballet.</p>
<p>For her 17th birthday, on Feburary 27, her parents took Chelsea to New York city for  the weekend, where they saw several shows.</p>
<p>She is also an avid outdoorswoman, having spent part of the summer of 1995 at an Alaska camp where she learned to mountain climb, a skill that she applied in the Grand Teton</p>
<p>Chelsea's choice of Stanford, where tuition and room and board cost just under $28,000 per year in 1996, put her on a separate path from her parents, who both graduated from Yale Law School after undergraduate work at elite eastern schools.</p>
<p>Stanford admitted only one applicant of every eight last year. Its distinguished alumni include Republican President Herbert Hoover, former Secretary of State Warren Christopher and astronaut Sally Ride.</p>
