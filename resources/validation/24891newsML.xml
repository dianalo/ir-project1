<p>The Baltic Freight Index (BFI) dropped 10 points to 1,100 on Friday in a London dry cargo freight market weighed down by easier rates for nearby Panamaxes.</p>
<p>Brokers said, however, that while Panamaxes might be a drag on the BFI, Capesize rates still seemed to be holding up.</p>
<p>They also noted a slow build-up of the grain harvest in North America and commented that easier grains prices are likely to tempt buyers soon.</p>
<p>The BFI had got up to 1,119 at the end of last week from a low at 1,060 on August 8.</p>
<p>The US Gulf/Japan route was assessed in the BFI sub-index on Friday at $20.42 after $20.95 on Thursday and $21.10 on Wednesday. Grains fixtures reported on Friday included Militos 54,000 tonnes heavy grains USGulf/Japan at $19.25 with no combination September 6-10 to Dreyfus.</p>
<p>However, brokers said there were inevitably few charterers around with stems that early. Meanwhile, ADM were reported to have fixed at $20.60 with no combination for 54,000/5 tonnes heavy grains US Gulf/Japan for September 25-30.</p>
<p>In the ore trades, brokers pointed to the Tubarao-Rotterdam fixture of 1982-built Hassbat Qatar for mid-September at $6. Biffex futures were again easier in modest volume.</p>
<p>Most-traded September eased by 25 to 1,116 in volume of 129 lots by 1530 GMT.</p>
