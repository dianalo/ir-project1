<p>AirTouch Communications Inc, the diversified cellular and paging operator, said it was on track to meet or exceed its previously stated goal of $1.5 billion in operating cash flow for the full 1997 year.</p>
<p>The company made the comments after reporting its second quarter results, in which it said earnings per share jumped 75 percent, far out ahead of Wall Street expectations, despite rising competition in its cellular phone markets.</p>
<p>AirTouch said second quarter earnings were $0.21 per share versus $0.12 in the year ago period. The quarterly earnings consensus had been $0.14 per share, according to First Call.  </p>
<p>Second quarter included a one-time gain of $0.03 per share, primarily due to adjustments in prior-year tax accruals. (Corrects reason for one-time gain.)</p>
<p>Prior to the gain, second quarter operating income rose 50 percent to $0.18.</p>
<p>&quot;Without a doubt this is the best quarter we've ever had,&quot; AirTouch Chairman and Chief Executive Sam Ginn said.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on these excellent results, we're on track to meet or exceed our 1997 goal of $1.5 billion in proportionate operating cash flow,&quot; Ginn said.</p>
<p>The company said second quarter operating cash flow profit margins grew to 35.6 percent from 30.8 percent a year ago.  </p>
<p>AirTouch said it added 617,000 cellular, personal communications services (PCS), and paging customers, reaching over nine million customers, including AirTouch's proportionate ownership in various domestic and international properties.</p>
<p>&quot;We still expect to add a record number of worldwide customers,&quot; Ginn said in discussing his outlook for the remainder of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;With our international start-ups reaching profitability and our U.S. cellular margins at an all-time high, we are well-positioned for the remainder of the year,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Bolstered by an expanding customer base, quarterly proportionate operating revenues rose 31 percent to $1.2 billion and proportionate operating cash flow, or operating income plus depreciation and amortization, grew 51 percent to $426 million compared with the second quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>The company said it serves 3.7 million proportionate U.S. cellular customers, up 47 percent from June 30, 1996.</p>
<p>Cellular ventures in 11 countries outside the U.S. increased their overall profitability in the quarter, they contributed substantially to its bottom line, AirTouch said.</p>
<p>Led by growth in Germany, Portugal, Italy and South Korea and high demand for prepaid service offerings, AirTouch said it had its best quarter ever internationally, adding 331,000 proportionate cellular customers.</p>
<p>The company serves 2,241,000 proportionate international customers, up 92 percent over June 30, 1996.</p>
<p>Ginn reiterated that he expected AirTouch international cellular operations to be profitable for the year as a whole.</p>
