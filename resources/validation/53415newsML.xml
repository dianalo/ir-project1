<p>Republicans scored one of their biggest victories in the 1994 congressional elections in the heart of Chicago by knocking off legendary Democratic House power broker Dan Rostenkowski.</p>
<p>Two years later, &quot;Rosty&quot; is in jail for corruption but the Democrats seem likely to recapture his old seat. The reason: Rostenkowski's Republican successor Michael Flanagan let himself become too closely associated with an agenda that is widely unpopular among voters in his heavily urban district.</p>
<p>Rod Blagojevich, a 39-year-old Illinois state legislator who has the support of the remnants of Chicago's Democratic political machine, said his internal polls showed him leading Flanagan -- figures disputed by the Flanagan campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels really good out there,&quot; Blagojevich said. He said his optimism stemmed in part from animosity toward House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a diverse district spread across heavily Democratic Chicago.</p>
<p>&quot;Flanagan has had an opportunity on a host of issues to vote his district but has chosen instead to vote to become a fellow traveller in the Gingrich revolution,&quot; Blagojevich said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm running against Mike Flanagan, not Newt Gingrich. I have to make sure I make that clear,&quot; he said. &quot;But Flanagan supports Gingrich for speaker, which sets in motion a whole agenda that Gingrich has driven which has been harmful to working middle-income families in our neighbourhoods.&quot;</p>
<p>A recent Democratic-sponsored poll showed Blagojevich had overtaken the incumbent by eight percentage points among likely Fifth Congressional District voters. The poll had an error margin of 4.4 percent. A poll paid for by Flanagan showed the Republican leading by a similar margin.</p>
<p>The election in this Chicago district is one of 50 or so that could decide which party gets majority control of the 435-member House of Representatives. And the incumbent has become the underdog.</p>
<p>&quot;To be within striking distance against one of the most formidable political armies ever assembled in Chicago, that's pretty good,&quot; Flanagan's campaign manager, Thom Serafin, said. He said he expected to be far outspent by the Democratic challenger, whom he called a &quot;mini-Bill Clinton&quot; for his campaign skills and alleged legislative failures.</p>
<p>Blagojevich said he would run strongest in the working-class &quot;bungalow belt&quot; of the Northwest Side and among lakefront yuppies, while suburban precincts will be &quot;a challenge.&quot; One-quarter of the district's residents are foreign-born, and German, Polish and Hungarian are spoken in some neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>In 1994 Flanagan, an unknown lawyer with a no political track record, was viewed as the accidental beneficiary of Rostenkowski's legal troubles, which have since landed the 36-year congressman in prison. The onetime chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee was sentenced to 17 months in prison after a plea bargain on charges he misused campaign funds and hired ghost payrollers.</p>
<p>&quot;We think (Flanagan's) campaign was more of a stealth candidacy -- sort of hide in the basement and wait for people to vote against Rostenkowski,&quot; Blagojevich said.</p>
<p>Rostenkowski was renowned for securing federal money and tax breaks for local projects and Flanagan has suprised some by using his relationship with Gingrich and his cachet as a rare Republican representing a largely urban district to win millions of federal dollars to help rebuild Chicago's crumbling lakefront and public transit system.</p>
<p>But as one of Rostenkowski's most strident critics, he has had to defend the newly acquired federal largess as &quot;good projects, not pork.&quot;</p>
<p>Blagojevich counters that Flanagan has a minuscule record, which includes a recent bill to confer honorary citizenship on Mother Teresa, that is out of step with his middle-class constituents. &quot;He thinks big government ought to be there to help big corporate special interests,&quot; he said.</p>
