<headline>Investor group seeks to double shareholder rolls.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-19</dateline>

<p>The National Association of Investors Corp said Wednesday it hoped to double the number of American shareholders in publicly traded companies to about 100 million persons within the next ten years.</p>
<p>&quot;We're hoping to reach that goal within the next five to 10 years,&quot; said Thomas O'Hara, chairman of the not-for-profit group that promotes direct stock ownership by individuals. He spoke at a press briefing at the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>NAIC officials acknowledged that direct investing in individual stocks has been taking a back seat to the purchase of mutual funds.  </p>
<p>Officials insisted that the group was not opposed to fund investing, but used the briefing to tout the benefits of direct investing in stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;You have control of your own destiny,&quot; said NAIC president Kenneth Janke.</p>
<p>NAIC officials expressed concern that investors were buying funds without always fully understanding what they were buying.</p>
<p>NAIC president Kenneth Janke said he was worried that investors shifting portfolio allocations as they tried to time the market were increasing their risks.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our view is to invest for the long term,&quot; said Janke, who explained that the 540,000 members in some 28,000 U.S. investment clubs tended to hold their stocks about seven years each.</p>
<p>NAIC officials said that of some 50 million U.S. investors, about half directly invested in stocks.</p>
<p>The group said it has enlisted about 200 U.S. corporations to help promote a national campaign to encourage individual investment.  The effort is being chaired by NYSE chairman Richard Grasso.</p>
<p>Three U.S. executives, McDonald's Corp chairman Michael Quinlan; National City Corp chairman David Daberko; and AFLAC Inc president Daniel Amos all attended the briefing to lend corporate support to the program.</p>
<p>The executives said their companies have long encouraged individual shareholder ownership.</p>
