<p>Peru's government has offered to let most of the rebels in the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima stay in the country if they release of all their hostages, a Japanese daily reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Mainichi Shimbun quoted sources close to Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and to the government's negotiating commission as saying the proposal was submitted during the last round of talks on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The government proposed letting most of the Marxist rebels remain in Peru without prosecution, provided rebel leader Nestor Cerpa and up to three other members of the group charged with previous offences went into exile in Cuba.</p>
<p>The goverment also offered to make prison reforms, including improving visit regulations and prison conditions, along with reforms in the judicial process and guarantees of changes in the way criminal investigations are undertaken, the daily reported.</p>
<p>The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) members were to have replied to the government proposal in the tenth round of talks on Friday, it said, but the rebels abruptly called off the meeting.</p>
<p>The MRTA rebels, who are holding 72 men hostage, said they had detected sounds of tunnels being dug, indicating that security forces planned to storm the residence.</p>
<p>Rebel leader Cerpa said on Saturday that he expected to meet on Sunday with mediators to discuss resuming talks with the government to end the 82-day crisis.</p>
