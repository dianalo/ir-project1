<p>A BSkyB executive has confirmed that the satellite broadcaster plans to offer access to the Internet via conventional television sets when it launches digital services in Britain next year.</p>
<p>&quot;My understanding is that versions of Internet access will be available,&quot; David Elstein, head of programming at BSkyB, said in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;The important point is that only 15 percent of UK homes have PCs (personal computers) and almost 100 percent have TVs,&quot; he said at the Edinburgh International Television Festival.</p>
<p>&quot;If the technology to link the Internet and the home television can be developed it must be very attractive.&quot;</p>
<p>BSkyB shares rose 21p to 578p in London on Friday as the market reacted positively to a newspaper report of the planned television link to the global computer network.</p>
<p>BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. is the largest shareholder, is planning to offer some 200 channels when it launches digital satellite into Britain in late 1997.</p>
<p>Elstein said the aim was to have Internet access available from the launch date.</p>
<p>Internet connections should be possible as the digital decoders needed to receive the service will have the computing power of an average PC combined with a high-speed modem.</p>
<p>BSkyB has emerged as the dominant force in British pay television in the 1990s and now has 5.5 million analog subscribers in Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday it announced a 66 percent rise in pre-tax profit to 257 million pounds ($165.1 million). Its recent strong share performance has pushed its market capitalization above nine billion pounds ($5.8 million).</p>
<p>The launch of digital in Britain next year is a key element in BSkyB's growth plans. The company has also formed a digital alliance with Kirch Group in Germany, Europe's largest television market, as it expands abroad.</p>
<p>BSkyB plans to offer home banking and home shopping services as part of its digital package.</p>
<p>It is in talks with British Telecom and a number of other possible partners. It is seeking partners who will help subsidise the cost of digital hardware to consumers in return for being allowed to run interactive services on the system.</p>
