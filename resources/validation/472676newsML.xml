<p>Sri Lanka stocks closed marginally higher in improved turnover amid widespread buying by local and foreign investors, brokers said.</p>
<p>The all share index closed 0.91 points up at 636.86. Price gains outnubmered losses by 24 to 16. Central Finance rose 2.50 to 242.50, Development Finance two rupees to 250.</p>
<p>&quot;The slow upward movement of the index is likely to hold because growth is expected to improve in 1997,&quot; said Shafi Waheed, a trader at CDIC Sasoon Cumberbatch.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors believe that things can only look up after the drought in 1996 which severely hit earnings,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Turnover was 84.4 million rupees on six million shares. The main trades were 1.5 million Distilleries Co, 1.2 million Asia Capital, 80,000 Hayleys, 769,500 Lanka Cement.</p>
<p>&quot;Turnover would have been higher if sellers had not been stubborn,&quot; said Subram Ramaswamy of brokerage Bartleet Mallory.</p>
<p>Sellers were waiting in the hope that the recent election victory by the government and a cut in reserve ratios will boost share prices, he said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank slashed reserve ratios by two percent to 12 percent on Monday, on top of a cut of one percent in January to reduce corporate borrowing costs.--Prithi Kodagoda (941) 434319</p>
