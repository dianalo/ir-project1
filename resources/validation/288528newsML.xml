<p>As Nicaragua's new right-wing government gets set to take power on Jan. 10, a fierce struggle is on among the political parties to win control of the future National Assembly, analysts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>President-elect Arnoldo Aleman's Liberal Alliance coalition will have 42 of the 93 seats in the new legislature which holds its first session on Jan. 9, the left-wing Sandinista Front will have 36 and a group of small parties will hold the remaining 15 seats.</p>
<p>The Liberals and the Sandinistas, neither of which have an outright majority, have lobbied furiously to win these small parties who hold the balance of power.</p>
<p>The first test of which of the two bitter political rivals will control Nicaragua's parliament will be the election of its president and board of directors on Jan. 9, political analyst Carlos Fernando Chamorro told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The election of the National Assembly's new board of directors will mark the opening bell of a new period of political conflict,&quot; said Chamorro, the youngest son of President Violeta Chamorro.</p>
<p>Chamorro said what remained to be seen was whether the small parties will serve as stabilising factors easing the parliament's polarisation between the Liberals and Sandinistas, or if it will become a forum for partisan political squabbling.</p>
<p>Analysts predicted a conflictive legislature in 1997 as the Liberals and Sandinistas, bitter historical rivals, fight to control the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega said his party will focus its efforts in opposition in the powerful National Assembly, turning it into a key political battleground.</p>
<p>The Liberals proposed candidates from their party for the top four positions of the National Assembly's seven-member board of directors, including Ivan Escobar Fornos as president.</p>
<p>The move sparked resistance from opposition legislators who accused the Liberals of trying to subordinate the National Assembly to the Liberal government.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears to me to be an unmistakable sign of a very strong desire by the winners to submit the National Assembly to the executive,&quot; said Noel Vidaurre, leader of the Nicaraguan Conservative Party (PCN). &quot;The position of the PCN is that there should be a balance in the assembly.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sandinistas also called for an independent National Assembly leadership as a counterweight to Liberal dominance.</p>
<p>Sandinista Congressman Nathan Sevilla said the board of directors &quot;must be pluralistic, including all the political expressions in the National Assembly.&quot;</p>
<p>As an independent candidate to lead the National Assembly, the Sandinistas have thrown their weight behind Enrique &quot;Cuco&quot; Sanchez, a former right-wing Contra rebel commander.</p>
<p>Sanchez was elected to the National Assembly on the Liberal Alliance ticket, but split from the alliance following a dispute with Aleman.</p>
