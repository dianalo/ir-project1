<headline>Mideast VLCCs unchanged but tone seen firm.</headline>

<p>Middle East very large crude carrier (VLCC) rates were little changed on Friday and looked set to remain firm next week, brokers said.</p>
<p>West Africa/U.S. 130,000 tonne (Suezmax) rates edged down over the week after reaching an unusually firm W110 last week, but this market &quot;in general terms is still rising,&quot; said brokers Galbraith's Ltd in their weekly tanker report.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt in our minds that the average rate for 1997 (for West Africa 130,000 tonne ships) will be five to 10 points more than it was in the previous year,&quot; they added.</p>
<p>They put  the current rate at W100 for a modern vessel and W97.5 for a mid-1970s-built ship.</p>
<p>New York-based Rigos Chartering Inc put West Africa Suezmaxes at W97 on Thursday, against a 1996 average of W90.86.</p>
<p>Referring to VLCCs, Galbraith's said, &quot;There is an underlying strength in the market and business done should remain at present levels if owners keep there heads...</p>
<p>&quot;The position list is not enormous, which would suggest that most charterers will probably pick off their preferred units quietly rather than blasting the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Cross-Med 80,000 tonne rates firmed to at least W120 from W110, with rumours of W130 or more paid, an Italian broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lack of tonnage for early dates, also fairly good enquiry, and maybe a bit of a rush to fix before the Easter break (next weekend),&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But Med 130,000 tonners fell on Friday to about W100 from W105 with at least one vessel fixed below W100, he said.</p>
<p>Galbraith's said rates for 130,000 tonne vessels were highly dependent on whether a vessel had major oil company approval, and this could cause levels to vary by about 20 points in the Med.  </p>
<p>Inter-UK/Cont 80,000 tonne crude rates were unchanged from Thursday at W140 -- up some five points on the week -- while 25,000 tonne fuel oil cargoes were down five points in both UKC and the Med at W200 and W205 respectively on declining enquiry.</p>
<p>Caribs/upcoast 70,000 tonne rates continued to firm to W225/230, partly due to havoc on the Mississippi river which has been blocked after a string of 25 barges under tow hit a bridge late on Monday. The silt-laden river has since reopened below Baton Rouge.</p>
<p>Fuel oil 50,000 tonne rates also climbed to W215 from W210.</p>
