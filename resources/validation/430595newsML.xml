<p>New York City's prestigious bar association on Monday urged state judicial officials to adopt a ban on &quot;pay-to-play&quot; by all law firms in the state that do municipal bond business, according to a written statement.</p>
<p>The Association of the Bar of the City of New York also announced it will urge the American Bar Association at its annual meeting in August to recommend that all states adopt the policy, according to the statement, which is accompanied by a 17-page report prepared by the city bar's government ethics panel.  </p>
<p>&quot;Tens of thousands, if not millions, of dollars flow from public finance lawyers to incumbent and insurgent candidates who control municipal finance business,&quot; NYC's bar said.</p>
<p>&quot;It certainly is believed that if a lawyer or his or her firm wants to be considered for municipal finance work, substantial political contributions must be made,&quot; the group added.</p>
<p>The proposed ban is patterned after the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's three-year-old pay-to-play rule G-37, which curbs contributions by muni dealers and was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The proposal would bar a law firm from representing a state or local government in municipal finance work if a lawyer at the firm made political contributions to public officials that control the muni finance work, NYC's bar said.</p>
<p>This is the second time New York City's bar will bring the matter before ABA's house of delegates.</p>
<p>The group offered a similar rule at the group's annual meeting last August, but withdrew it after some delegates wanted some revisions and more time to review it, the city bar said.</p>
<p>Joel Berger, chair of the city bar's government ethics panel conceded that the proposal is controversial.</p>
<p>&quot;Politicians may be reluctant to part with a source of significant financial support, and lawyers may view the rule as an undue restriction on their conduct,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is our believe, however, that even the appearance of political 'pay back' in the legal community has serious adverse implications,&quot; he said.</p>
