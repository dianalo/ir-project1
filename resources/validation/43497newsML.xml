<p>Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is giving only half-hearted support to efforts to oust hard-line Bosnian Serb leaders in elections because he wants them to take the blame for difficult times ahead, diplomats say.</p>
<p>Milosevic, the powerful patron of Serb leader Radovan Karadzic until relations between them deteriorated sharply in 1993, is ostensibly backing opposition parties campaigning against the ruling Serbian Democratic Party (SDS).</p>
<p>But diplomats feel Milosevic's support is only half-hearted, and that he would actually prefer to see the hard-line SDS win.</p>
<p>&quot;Paradoxical as it might seem, Milosevic wants his rivals from the SDS to win and form a government this time round. At the next elections in two year's time it will be a different story,&quot; a senior Western diplomat said.</p>
<p>The international community forced Karadzic, who as an indicted war criminal is barred from running for office, to step down this summer, a move it hoped would take the bite out of the SDS leadership.</p>
<p>But international monitors warn that Karadzic is still sitting in his office, still being addressed as President by his followers and still effectively wields the same influence over the separatist Bosnian Serb republic as before.</p>
<p>&quot;It is Karadzic and no one else who is masterminding the SDS election campaign,&quot; opposition leader Mladen Ivanic said.</p>
<p>Two main opposition blocs are opposing the SDS in Saturday's elections -- the Alliance for Peace and Progress (SMP) led by the Bosnian branch of Serbia's ruling Socialist Party and the Democratic Patriotic Bloc (DPB) led by the charismatic mayor of Banja Luka, Predrag Radic.</p>
<p>Both opposition blocs, who are likely to get up to 45 percent of the 80-seat future Bosnian Serb parliament, are just as nationalist as the SDS, but more pragmatic and keen to establish relations with the West and former foes.</p>
<p>On the surface, Milosevic appears to be helping out his proteges -- he has sent three of his senior party officials to attend various SMP rallies and Serbian state television gives time for the SMP and the DPB. The SDS is hardly ever mentioned.</p>
<p>But diplomats say this support is too little, too late.</p>
<p>An independent television station and a relay of Serbian television, both designed to compete with the SDS-controlled official channel, started broadcasting only last weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;Who in their right mind can believe that this independent television can make people change their minds just one week before the polls?&quot; Ivanic said.</p>
<p>Opposition leaders say their rallies have been disrupted by SDS followers, and the SMP has compiled a long list of physical intimidation, including bombings and arson against its supporters, which some opposition leaders feel Milosevic could have ended with a single telephone call.</p>
<p>Diplomats say Milosevic would like to see the SDS win only a small majority in the parliament, just enough to saddle it with the blame for any mistakes it is likely to make in troubled times ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing in Bosnia has been solved yet and the country is partitioned as ever despite the Dayton peace accord,&quot; the Western diplomat said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a mess and it's going to be a mess until the next elections at least, and Milosevic does not want to be held accountable any longer for that mess,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Milosevic has recently acted to stabilise the situation in the Balkans, to the chagrin of nationalists, normalising relations with arch-rival Croatia and moving to establish economic ties with the Moslem-led government in Sarajevo.</p>
<p>&quot;Milosevic wants to enter the club of internationally respected politicians, and in that context Bosnia is like a stone around his neck,&quot; the diplomat said.</p>
<p>&quot;He wants to be able to tell us -- you wanted these elections, you engineered them and now the people have voted these thugs into the office. I have no influence over them, they are not mine so don't hold me responsible,&quot; he added.</p>
