<p>Lawyers for Vietnamese asylum-seekers said on Monday they plan to sue the government to release more than 4,000 boatpeople, claiming they are being detained illegally in Hong Kong refugee camps.</p>
<p>The legal defence group Refugee Concern said it would file the habeas corpus case with the territory's High Court in the next few days, arguing that the asylum-seekers -- incarcerated for years -- were being held &quot;for unreasonable periods&quot;.</p>
<p>The case is expected to put added pressure on the Hong Kong and British governments, which are juggling simmering tension in the camps, pressure from China to repatriate the refugees, and Vietnam's resistance to an influx of thousands of unwanted boatpeople.</p>
<p>It would be the largest ever release of refugees from the camps.</p>
<p>Rob Brook, a lawyer with Refugee Concern, told Reuters that lawyers had taken 1,500 statements, mostly from heads of families, representing more than 4,000 detainees in Hong Kong's camps.</p>
<p>Refugee Concern will argue the migrants had no chance of being taken back by Vietnam, and thus Hong Kong authorities were detaining them for an unreasonable length of time, Brook said.</p>
<p>Habeas corpus is the British legal remedy for dealing with wrongful imprisonment. Once lawyers have filed it, a High Court judge must decide whether to summon the government to justify continuing detention.</p>
<p>&quot;We're hoping to get it filed this week,&quot; Brook said. &quot;We've got to put some finishing touches on it.&quot;</p>
<p>If the High Court suit failed, the lawyers could turn to Hong Kong's Court of Appeal and finally to Britain's highest appeals court, the Privy Council. But it could be difficult to get the case to the council before China takes over the British colony in July.</p>
<p>&quot;We are confident. We think we've got a very strong case,&quot; Brook said.</p>
<p>Legal precedent would appear to be on the side of the boatpeople. More than 300 Vietnamese have been freed this year based on a Privy Council precedent that said some boatpeople could not be held if Vietnam had not accepted them for repatriation.</p>
<p>Beijing has demanded that all Vietnamese camps in Hong Kong be emptied before Britain hands the territory over to China at midnight next June 30.</p>
<p>The number of boatpeople languishing in Hong Kong's camps has been reduced to 10,500 this year through a combination of voluntary and forced returns to Vietnam.</p>
<p>Several times this year, tensions in the camps exploded into fierce rioting and mass breakouts. Some boatpeople facing mandatory repatriation assaulted Hong Kong police or turned to self-mutilation to avoid deportation.</p>
<p>The asylum-seekers are the tail end of a two-decade-old flood of people who streamed out of Vietnam -- many by boat -- after the communists won the Vietnam War in 1975.</p>
<p>Hanoi has doggedly refused to take back thousands of the remaining inmates, claiming they are not real Vietnamese. Many of them are ethnic Chinese holding documents issued by the nationalist Chinese government of Taiwan.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, stressing that Britain will not take in the unwanted boatpeople, flew to Vietnam last week in a failed bid to end the impasse.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major has written a letter to Vietnam's Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet appealing for cooperation.</p>
