<p>European stock markets ended lower but well above their lows on Friday, cheered by a rebound on Wall Street from its near 100-point drop on Thursday.</p>
<p>The other main market focus was the European Union summit in Dublin, where news of agreement on a budget stability pact to underpin a single euro currency weakened the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks as if Germany has climbed down from its tough demands. That should be bad news for the mark and good news for the high-yielders (other European currencies with higher interest rates),&quot; said Nick Stamenkovic at DKB International.</p>
<p>The mark slipped to a near seven-month low of 3.3719 French francs from 3.3835 a day earlier and to 986.85 lire from 989.40.</p>
<p>But European debt markets rose on the news from Dublin, relieved to see agreement on enforcing fiscal discipline under monetary union from 1999. German Finance Minister Theo Waigel also professed his satisfaction after tough bargaining.</p>
<p>&quot;I am satisfied,&quot; Waigel told reporters. &quot;It was hard work but successful. It's an important step for the preparation of economic and monetary union (EMU) and it's an important signal for the people and for the markets.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average of key U.S. stocks, which had fallen 170 points or 2.5 percent in the past two sessions, spent the New York morning on a roller-coaster ride before showing a gain of around 30 points as European markets closed.</p>
<p>&quot;Bonds have rallied and that's helping stocks right now,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany in New York. &quot;But there's no question it's one of those very guarded, edgy rallies.&quot;</p>
<p>Underlining current market uncertainties, the Dow soon dropped back into the minus column before edging up yet again.</p>
<p>&quot;The (U.S.) market is in a corrective stage and I think we have another 100 points before we see some stabilisation,&quot; said Peter Cardillo at Westfalia Investments in New York.</p>
<p>As the world's biggest stock market seeks its level after gaining almost a third this year, European bourses watch its every move. From the opening on Friday, investors in Europe, fretting that New York might be suffering something worse than a passing cold, had taken more profits after a successful year.</p>
<p>A week ago markets plunged worldwide after remarks by U.S. central bank chief Alan Greenspan on the &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; of the U.S. stock market.</p>
<p>But London traders reported a lack of selling pressure. &quot;The market is down but we could see a bit of a bounce next week,&quot; the head of trading at a large London investment bank said.</p>
<p>German shares pared their sharp losses by the close but concern over further global stock market weakness kept prices under pressure, with attention fixed on Wall Street.</p>
<p>&quot;We had Wall Street, we had this technical problem (an interruption to trading) and it's Friday the 13th as well,&quot; said one Duesseldorf dealer.</p>
<p>French stocks ended with limited losses -- a fifth of what they were at their worst -- following Wall Street's recovery and gains for bond prices and the franc after the EU deal.</p>
<p>Traders said the bourse looked oversold after a correction of nearly eight percent in the past 10 days but it remained very vulnerable to moves on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Apart from the jolt to the mark, the dollar benefited from heavy U.S. buying. Dealers said it also gained from market talk that a private Washington-based consultancy reported that Japan would tolerate a rise in the U.S. currency to 120 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;It's encouraging to see how the dollar held above 1.54 with all the trouble in the U.S. asset markets lately,&quot; added Brian Kiely, treasury technician at Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT THE EUROPEAN CLOSE</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 114 yen and 1.5475 marks in late European business against 113.33 and 1.5427 a day earlier.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT THE EUROPEAN CLOSE</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of top British shares ended down 18.3 points at 3,972.4. In Paris, the CAC-40 share index finished 8.70 lower at 2,203.41.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX in Frankfurt shed 47.37 to 2,799.71 in floor trade but recovered to 2,815.77 in later computerised trading.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold ended London trading at $369.80 an ounce after being fixed at $369.00 in the afternoon, compared with Thursday's late $368.45. Silver edged up one cent to $4.83.</p>
