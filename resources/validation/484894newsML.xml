<p>Eurotunnel SA Plc said on Thursday it had given the all-clear to its freight rolling stock and said it was confident it did not need costly redesign in the aftermath of last November's Channel Tunnel blaze.</p>
<p>But it pledged to spend 21 million stg on other new safety measures.</p>
<p>Publishing the findings of its inquiry into the November 18 fire which swept through a main tunnel causing widespread damage and reduced services, Eurotunnel said it planned to spend most of the money on installing fire stations and water hydrants for the tunnel.</p>
<p>New safety systems will cost 20 million pounds, with one to one-and-a-half million earmarked for increased staffing levels and training.</p>
<p>But the final verdict will not lie with the company but the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority which has yet to report back.</p>
<p>Co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle told a press conference, &quot;We've spent the last few weeks discussing our proposals in depth and these are still going on and will continue in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel appears confident of clearance, however, predicting a resumption of freight services by mid-June.</p>
<p>Both co-chairmen, Ponsolle and Robert Malpas vigorously denied that they were placing profit before safety by deciding not to redesign the controversial open-sided freight wagons where the fire broke out.</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard the view that we were torn between safety and our finances. Well let me tell you simply -- as chairman of this company I have never experienced this contradiction.</p>
<p>&quot;We can only be successful if our customers are convinced it is one of the safest transport systems in the world,&quot; said Ponsolle.</p>
<p>Malpas said its first priority was protecting passengers, with the group assets coming second.</p>
<p>He said the Kent Fire Brigade in England, which fought the 1,000 degree centrigrade fire last year, was wrong to infer that the design of the open wagons fanned the blaze.</p>
<p>The KFB has called on Eurotunnel to close the sides of the freight wagons, saying the latticed frames acted like &quot;blow torch&quot; last time.</p>
<p>&quot;I've read reports of the blow-torch effect. It does not exist. It is a fallacy; nothing could prove its existence,&quot; said Malpas, claiming Eurotunnel had expert advice on this.</p>
<p>But the group has made some key changes. First, in the event of a fire in a main tunnel, the train will make a stop near the next available entry point to the safety tunnel -- a separate and sealed tunnel running parallel which has been described as a &quot;permanent lifeboat&quot; in case of disaster.</p>
<p>Previously a train would have continued until it left the tunnel.</p>
<p>Passengers will have access to protective masks if smoke enters the cabins.</p>
<p>More checks will be made on trains before they depart and as they arrive at stations and freight trucks will also be closely monitored before the train leaves the station.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel will boost links with the control centre and the train captain will be responsible for train evacuation.</p>
<p>The Anglo-French tunnel group admitted that even with its new systems in place it would not be 100 percent safe.</p>
<p>Ponsolle told the briefing, &quot;I am not optimistic to say it will never happen again. I do not believe you can provide 100 percent safety.&quot; But he said the new procedures would give a speedier reaction if November 18 was ever repeated.</p>
