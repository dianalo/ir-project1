<p>Australia's Michael Doohan took his third consecutive 500cc world championship after finishing second behind local man Carlos Checa in the Grand Prix of Catalonia on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's unbelievable, at the beginning of the year I just didn't think this was possible&quot; said Doohan.</p>
<p>For Checa, a local man, it was the first win of a promising career and some compensation after falling whilst leading last year's race.</p>
<p>He received the race trophy from King Juan Carlos, himself a keen motorcycle enthusiast.</p>
<p>Doohan said that Checa's move had helped him. &quot;Checa took the lead and that was good -- it took the pressure off meaning I could finish lower down.&quot;</p>
<p>Doohan, who had only needed to finish second to ensure the title, fulfilled his pre-race promise of sticking to Alex Criville, the only rider who could catch the Australian in the overall standings.</p>
<p>Italy's Luca Cadalora was first off the grid, but was unable to contain Checa who took the lead on the third lap and never looked back.</p>
<p>Behind him Criville and Doohan were involved in an exciting battle that saw the rival Honda men exchange places nine times.  </p>
<p>Although Doohan could have allowed Criville to take second and himself finish fourth, the Australian pulled out the stops to beat the Spaniard by just 0.049 seconds.</p>
<p>It was a fitting climax to a season dominated by the rivalry, and occasional conflict, between the two.</p>
<p>With two races remaining Criville's performance guaranteed him second place in the championship, the best classification ever obtained by a Spaniard.</p>
<p>&quot;It would have been nice to win at home, but Checa went really well,&quot; said Criville.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day Max Biaggi boosted his own chances of retaining the 250cc world title after recovering from a mistake at the first bend to surge past Frenchman Olivier Jacque to his eighth win of the season.</p>
<p>Biaggi, who did `wheelies' around much of the last lap and then threw his helmet to fans, extends his championship lead over Germany's Ralf Waldmann to 21 points.</p>
<p>Tomomi Manako celebrated his first win in the 125cc category in more controversial fashion -- the Japanese rider grasped his right arm at the elbow with the left and repeatedly raised a finger in what appeared to be a traditional Latin insult.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't know what it meant, I was saying `number one'&quot; said a smiling Manako afterwards.</p>
<p>The win moved Manako into contention in the 125 cc championship, leaving him just one point behind second-placed rider Masaki Tokudome, a faller at the first bend.</p>
<p>Leading the championship a further 14 points ahead is another Japanese rider, Haruchika Aoki, who finished fifth.</p>
