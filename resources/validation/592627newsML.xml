<p>German economic growth in the first quarter of 1997 may have increased about 0.5 percent on a seasonally and inflation-adjusted basis compared to the fourth quarter of 1996, the Economics Ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>The ministry said the rise came even though the number of work days was reduced by bad winter weather at the beginning of the year.  </p>
<p>Exports were driving growth and helped lift manufacturing capacity utilisation in west Germany to 84.9 percent in March -- its highest level since 1995, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Improved demand led to first-quarter industrial gains. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, first-quarter orders rose 1.5 percent while output increased two percent, the ministry said.</p>
<p>At the same time, the weak labour market remained unchanged, while first-quarter construction output was hurt by bad weather and fell 10.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Germany's price climate was extraordinarily stable as the dollar's strength had kept import prices down.</p>
<p>The economy was also helped by a favourable balance of trade at the beginning of 1997. For January and February, exports rose 6.4 percent compared to the same two months in 1996, while imports rose 5.5 percent.</p>
