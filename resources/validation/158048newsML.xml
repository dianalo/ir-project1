<p>France's Marcel Carne, who died on Thursday aged 90, fathered a cinematic legend in the 1930s but his later films never recaptured the success of his golden years and his last project collapsed because of lack of funds.</p>
<p>Carne won widespread acclaim for classics &quot;Les Enfants du Paradis&quot; and &quot;Hotel du Nord&quot; in the 1930s and 1940s, and worked consistently for three decades after World War Two. But his post-war career was plagued by critical and commercial setbacks.</p>
<p>In 1992 the veteran director attempted to relaunch his film career after a 20-year break, at the age of 83. He based his planned &quot;Mouche&quot; on a short story by the 19th century French writer Guy de Maupassant set in 1875, the year impressionist painting burst on the art world.</p>
<p>But the film based on a boat trip by five young men and the young painter's model they had all fallen for was never made. Shortly after filming had started, funding problems forced a halt and the production company later went bankrupt.</p>
<p>Despite his age, Carne had proved his stamina at the 1992 Cannes film festival, partying until the early hours every night. &quot;I still have energy and a certain freshness,&quot; the short, pudgy director said at the time.</p>
<p>Born in Paris in 1906, Carne was brought up largely by his grandmother and an aunt. His father, a carpenter, was often away and his mother had died when he was five years old.</p>
<p>After minimal schooling, his family urged him to become an apprentice in his father's trade but he preferred to start out in an insurance office.</p>
<p>Obsessed by the cinema early on, he took lessons in photography at the Paris arts and crafts school, which did not offer film-making courses.</p>
<p>His stint as editor of Film-Hebdo magazine ended abruptly when Carne resigned in protest at a disparaging remark made by the magazine's owner about Charles Chaplin.</p>
<p>On a visit to a studio, he was hired as an assistant by director Jacques Feyder, and then Rene Clair to make &quot;Sous les Toits de Paris&quot; in 1930.</p>
<p>Six years later he had his first opportunity to direct a full-length production, &quot;Jenny&quot;, forging close ties with poet Jacques Prevert and composer Joseph Kosma.</p>
<p>&quot;Quai des Brumes&quot;, starring Jean Gabin, was a critical and box-office success. &quot;L'Hotel du Nord&quot; (1938) is still regarded as a classic of French cinema, with one of the most memorable lines of dialogue -- Arletty's rasping, derisive pronunciation of the single word &quot;atmosphere&quot;.</p>
<p>The wartime pro-Nazi Vichy regime bridled at Carne's unconcealed left-wing sympathies coupled with fatalism, and he turned away from portrayals of the contemporary scene to make two of his finest works.</p>
<p>&quot;Les Visiteurs du Soir&quot; (1942) drew viewers into a medieval drama world, and &quot;Les Enfants du Paradis&quot; (1943), with its prodigious cast including Arletty, Pierre Brasseur and Jean-Louis Barrault, evoked the sleazy street life of Paris in the mid-19th century.</p>
<p>But he was hit by the end of his partnership with scriptwriter and poet Jacques Prevert in 1947, and then by the arrival of the French &quot;new wave&quot; in the late 1950s which rejected his classical style of film-making.</p>
<p>Only &quot;Therese Raquin&quot; (1953), based on the novel by Zola, found favour with the public.</p>
<p>His last feature film was made in 1974, he shot a documentary about the Bible, worked on giant photo collages that he exhibited around the world and supervised the transformation of his own films into colour.</p>
<p>It was not old age that caused Carne, honoured when France celebrated the 100th anniversary of film in 1995, to stop. He never lost his energy or love of talking.</p>
<p>&quot;The last couple of films I made were not a success. I didn't want to become academic and dry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>With his ginger hair nearly all lost, his knees arthritic, he added: &quot;I'm not a magician. I have to watch out. I can't expect to maintain the energy of a 20-year-old.&quot;</p>
