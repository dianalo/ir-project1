<p>ABN AMRO North America Inc chief executive Harrison Tempest said Friday that its planned $1.9 billion acquisition of Standard Federal Bancorp Inc would likely be its last deal for about two years.</p>
<p>&quot;We're out of the acquisition business for some time now,&quot; Tempest said at a news conference.</p>
<p>When asked how long before ABN AMRO North America might make another deal, he said, &quot;probably two years.&quot;</p>
<p>ABN AMRO is a unit of ANB AMRO Holding NV of the Netherlands.  </p>
<p>Standard Federal chief lending officer Garry Carley said other banks had expressed interest in buying the Troy, Mich.-based bank holding company over the past two-and-a-half years.</p>
<p>&quot;We had others who expressed strong interest in the bank,&quot; Carley told reporters.</p>
<p>He said ABN AMRO made the highest bid for the bank, which has about $15.5 billion in assets.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the highest offer - period,&quot; Carley said.  </p>
<p>Tempest said that ABN AMRO believed only an in-market acquirer would have been able to achieve more cost cuts than it will be able to achieve by merging Standard Federal's operations with ABN AMRO North America.</p>
<p>He also said anti-trust laws would bar an acquisition of Standard Federal by another large Michigan bank.</p>
<p>&quot;When you pay a substantial premium, you have to find some cost savings,&quot; Tempest said. While the $59 a share offer ABN AMRO has made is only $1.00 above Thursday's closing price, Standard Federal has risen 34 percent since negotiations between the two companies began, he said.  </p>
<p>He said the bank does not know how large the cost reductions will be. While both Tempest and Carley said no immediate job cuts are planned, they said some will occur over time through merging of administrative duties.</p>
<p>Tempest also said the acquisition fit ABN AMRO North America's strategy of expanding in adjacent states and building market share.</p>
<p>&quot;We still believe there is a very big success factor tied to market share,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>With Standard Federal, ABN AMRO North America will have the second largest deposit base in the Chicago market, while Standard Federal is number three in Detroit and number four in Michigan.</p>
<p>The combined banks will also be the eighth largest mortgage originator in the United States, using data as of June 30, ABN AMRO said.</p>
<p>&quot;It gets us into the league we want to be in mortgage servicing and mortgage origination,&quot; Tempest said.</p>
