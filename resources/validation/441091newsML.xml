<p>The Dutch parties involved in rescue talks for what is left of bankrupt Dutch aircraft maker Fokker NV appear to have agreed a common position for further negotiations with Malaysia which is interested in kick-starting Fokker, Dutch ANP news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Dutch Economic Affairs Minister Hans Wijers said earlier he would brief reporters on the Fokker situation, but his ministry later put this briefing on hold until further notice.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks good. All we need now is a definitive 'yes' from Stork,&quot; ANP quoted one unnamed source close to the talks as saying. Fokker administrators declined any comment.</p>
<p>The Dutch and Malaysian governments, Stork, which owns Fokker Aviation, Fokker administrators and Andre Deleye, chairman of Dutch industrial group Begemann NV, have been negotiating for weeks in an attempt to salvage something from the company that was declared bankrupt in March 1996.</p>
<p>The Malaysian state is the likeliest eleventh hour saviour for Fokker NV after a number of potential suitors -- from Canadians and Koreans to Russians -- failed to come up with a viable rescue package.</p>
<p>Fokker was declared bankrupt a year ago after majority shareholder Daimler Benz AG of Germany said it would no longer bear Fokker's huge losses.</p>
<p>Administrators have kept Fokker's factory near Amsterdam working on a handful of outstanding orders, but most of the company's skilled labour force has long since left.</p>
<p>Barring a last-minute miracle, the plant will close for good soon and the assets will be liquidated.</p>
<p>After Fokker was cut loose by Daimler, Stork bought up Fokker Aviation -- comprising the profitable aircraft maintenance and components businesses -- in a deal binding it to some involvement in a relaunch.</p>
<p>Industry sources say any Fokker relaunch would face massive start-up costs and could take up to a year to get into business.</p>
<p>The Dutch have said that a Malaysian plan involves taking a 49 percent stake in a new entity in a deal which would keep production units in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The current negotaitions are thought to centre on who else would take part in a salvage operation.</p>
