<p>The Athens bourse's white-knuckle ride in the last four sessions has been tough to stomach, especially for those investors who got in at the top and got caught in a turbulent 17 percent correction.</p>
<p>But despite the market's explosive volatility, brokers maintain a bullish outlook as fundamentals still favour exposure in equities.</p>
<p>Some, like Eurobank funds and Sigma Securities, issued a buy recommendation despite the wild ride, feeling the market had become oversold.</p>
<p>Market watchers have attributed the panic selling early in the week to a capital market commission warning against rumour-based investment decisions and the erupting Albanian crisis.</p>
<p>After its sharp 17 percent fall the bourse stabilised on Tuesday and rebounded a sharp 6.53 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Brushing aside the sudden shifts in psychology, the key issue that bodes well for equities this year is the improvement of the macroeconomic picture.</p>
<p>Deflation has already driven net yields on treasury paper to single-digit territory, prompting asset reallocation.</p>
<p>Greek growth funds, which have managed enticing double digit returns in only two months, are increasingly in the spotlight but still made up a very low 2.45 percent of the mutual fund industry's assets in end-February.</p>
<p>According to statistics provided by the association of institutional investors, growth funds investing in Greek equities saw assets rise 21.7 percent in February. On aggregate, they experienced inflows of 8.38 percent.</p>
<p>Eurobank fund manager Alex Pappas says the ratio of growth fund assets to the bourse's market capitalisation is very low and sees it rising.</p>
<p>&quot;The ratio will rise, a result of asset reallocation into equities as investors search for better performance and reduce fixed income exposure,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Other brokers said the pendulum-like market swings will subside as Greece's favourable macroeconomic outlook has not changed.</p>
<p>CPI inflation is expected to ease to 6.5-6.6 percent in February from 6.8 percent in January, a 25-year record low.</p>
<p>The bourse may be in for some more nervous trading but the bulls are coming back to the ring after Monday's knock-out punch, judging by Wednesday's session.</p>
