<dateline>SALANG PASS, Afghanistan 1996-10-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>From dusty parade grounds outside Mazar-i-Sharif to the snowy heights of the Salang pass north of Kabul, the forces of Uzbek militant leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum say they are glad to be at peace but are ready for war.</p>
<p>Dostum's soldiers, armour and artillery, deployed in force along the pass, were digging in at the weekend in anticipation of having to defend the strategic highway and its tunnels from attack by Taleban forces trying to move north out of Kabul.</p>
<p>&quot;We control the Salang. No army can move past us through the pass unless we allow it. You can see we control every turn in the road, every ridge,&quot; General Abdul Majid Ruzi, Dostum's Salang commander, said on Friday.</p>
<p>As snow swirled in a bitter wind at the top of the pass, sun-burnished young soldiers in Russian winter uniforms tended tanks, howitzers, heavy mortars and multiple-barreled rocket launchers.</p>
<p>With their gunsights trained south on torturous switchbacks and narrow defiles through which any advancing force force would have to move, Dostum's positions seemed impregnable.</p>
<p>For the moment the current focus of battle lies between Salang and Kabul where government troops loyal to Ahmad Shah Masood are counter-attacking their way against Taleban forces who captured the Afghan capital from them just two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Dostum, estranged from Masood and the government since 1994, has warned the Taleban that his troops may respond to continued attacks northward, but for the moment they are in a defensive posture and content to let Masood fight.</p>
<p>&quot;Our relations with Masood's troops are correct but we have no orders from General Dostum to get involved in their fight. It would be better to solve this peacefully with negotiation,&quot; explained Ruzi. &quot;But if the order comes, we are ready.&quot;</p>
<p>Part of Dostum's reluctance may spring from the fighting which broke out between his forces and Masood's along the Salang highway in the spring of this year, with heavy loss of life on both sides.</p>
<p>Masood's advance north towards Pol-e-Khomri was finally blocked but the carcasses of dead tanks still litter the Salang highway around Markhan where the battle was most fierce.</p>
<p>&quot;It will not be possible for Dostum and Masood to trust one another and certainly not to like one another. but it might be possible for them to cooperate militarily if the threat from the Taleban becomes severe,&quot; explained an aid worker.</p>
<p>&quot;For the moment Dostum seems content to allow Masood to do the fighting and dying while he protects the pass, which is the most direct route into his territory. He won't let Masood be totally defeated, but he won't mind letting him bleed a bit.&quot;</p>
<p>On Saturday, the road from Salang pass to Kabul was a patchwork of fighting with Masood's forces, Taleban and groups of local citizens offended by Taleban's ultra-strict Islamic code battling in a number of places, including Jabal os-Siraj and Charikar, Dostum sources said.</p>
<p>Several hundred miles to the north in Dostum's stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif, Lieutenant-General Mohamed Sadiq was confident that the discipline of his troops would be more than a match for taleban if it comes to it.</p>
<p>Proudly displaying 14 T-55 tanks which roared into life on signal and threw up huge rooster-tails of dust as they rumbled away menacingly at a camp west of Mazar-i-Sharif, Sadiq summed up the situation concisely in an interview this week.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a very powerful, disciplined army,&quot; he said. &quot;If General Dostum gives the order and we start fighting alongside Masood the Taleban would be immediately retreating. No problem.&quot;</p>
