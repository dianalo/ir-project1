<p>Bosnian elections took a potentially ominous turn on Wednesday when three parties, two of them Moslem, urged refugees living abroad not to cast ballots until voter registration irregularities are resolved.</p>
<p>About 640,000 Bosnian refugees are registered to vote in 55 countries around the world from Wednesday, August 28. The in-country election day for Bosnia is September 14.</p>
<p>Wednesday's boycott call was led by the ruling Moslem nationalist Party of Democratic Action (SDA), which is headed by Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic.</p>
<p>Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) officials in charge of the elections were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>An SDA statement said it wanted a boycott because of a lack of clarity in the OSCE's Tuesday decision to postpone municipal elections over numerous problems including registration irregularities.</p>
<p>Elections for cantonal assemblies, separate Moslem-Croat and Serb parliaments, a national House of Representatives and a collective Presidency were not affected by the OSCE decision.</p>
<p>SDA also said it needed time to consult with other parties contesting the elections.</p>
<p>The SDA call for a refugee boycott was joined by the Party for BH, led by Bosnia's war-time Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic.</p>
<p>The Bosnian Patriotic Party, headed by former Bosnian army commander Sefer Halilovic, also called for refugees not to vote and termed the elections a &quot;cunning fraud&quot;.</p>
<p>The SDA and the Bosnian Patriotic Party are principally Moslem. The Party for BH makes a multi-ethnic appeal for voters. Together, the party leaders are among Bosnia's most prominent Moslems.</p>
<p>The parties complained on Wednesday that the OSCE's decision to postpone municipal elections sidestepped the larger problem of Serb fraud in voter registration without addressing or resolving it.</p>
<p>Independent observers, including those from OSCE, accuse Serb authorities of actively discouraging refugees from registering to vote in municipalities where they lived before the Bosnian war broke out in 1992.</p>
<p>Instead, the monitors say, Serb refugees were steered to register in pivotal towns which once had Moslem majorities but which are now underpopulated after having been &quot;ethnically cleansed&quot; during the war.</p>
<p>Diplomats explain that the aim of the electoral engineering is to sieze undisputed political control of strategic locations inside the 49 per cent of Bosnia known as the Serb republic.</p>
<p>Winning such control would amount to an important way- station on the road to achieving the Bosnian Serbs' war-time goals of independence from Bosnia and affiliation with neighbouring Serbia.</p>
<p>Bosnian Moslems, who share an uneasy federation with Croats on the other 51 per cent of Bosnia, won a victory of sorts on Tuesday when the OSCE postponed the municipal elections.</p>
<p>But they argue that so long as refugees are allowed to vote in places other than their pre-war residences, and so long as they are prevented from returning to their homes as envisaged under the Dayton peace agreement, Bosnia is on the road to partition.</p>
