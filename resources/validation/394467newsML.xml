<title>BELGIUM: Profit-taking, options expiry shake Brussels bourse.</title>
<headline>Profit-taking, options expiry shake Brussels bourse.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-02-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>A new bout of profittaking and the expiry of stock options combined on Friday to rattle an already edgy Brussels bourse, pushing it lower in a high volume of business, traders said.</p>
<p>They added that the developing consolidation phase, said by many to be overdue after the market's strong rally so far this year, looked likely to continue into next week.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the options expiry, profit-taking and the easier dollar that did it today,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders noted that, as on Thursday, financial stocks were the main gainers and industrials the main losers.</p>
<p>The Bel-20 share index  .BFX ended 0.41 percent lower at 2,094.76, having moved in a 2,102.95/2,080.83 range. A hefty total of 6.5 billion france of Belgian shares changed hands.</p>
<p>&quot;That is a pretty huge volume. But it was because of the options expiry,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Holding company SGB climbed 1.4 percent to 2,850 francs. Among financials Generale Bank was 0.8 percent higher at 12,200 francs, and Bank Bruxelles Lambert rose 0.7 percent to 7,260 francs, but Kredietbank was unchanged at 11,950 francs.</p>
<p>Traders said the stocks reacted to recent underperformance.</p>
<p>Metals group Union Miniere, which has been hovering in overbrought territory recently according to Reuters Security 3000 data, moved back between the brackets on Friday.</p>
<p>The stock fell 2.9 percent to 2,460 francs in heavy volume of nearly 81,000 shares.</p>
<p>Retailer GIB fell 3.3 percent to 1,480 francs in turnover with a block of 50,000 shares pushed across the market in the last half hour of business making half the day's volume.</p>
<p>PetroFina, which announced a Vietnamese oil find after the close of play, fell 1.2 percent to 12,275 francs.</p>
<p>Fast food chain Quick, which announced a 48 percent drop in 1996 profits after the market closed, was 10 francs lower at 1,880 francs.</p>
<p>At the exotic end of the market holding firm Des Glaces de Moustier-Sur-Sambre -- which luxuriates in being the most expensive stock quoted in Brussels -- climbed 4,100 francs to 219,000. Eight shares changed hands.</p>
<p>The share has risen steadily since December 23 when it was a mere 165,050 francs.</p>
