<headline>German SPD party seeks to repeal cuts in sick pay.</headline>

<p>Following weeks of bitter feuding over a three-month old law reducing sick payments, Germany' opposition party at the weekend launched a campaign aimed at repealing the new rule.</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's opposition Social Democrats (SPD) said they had drafted a legislation to revoke the cut in sick-pay benefits and would introduce the bill to parliament early next year.</p>
<p>On October 1, a new law became effective allowing employers to reduce workers' salaries to 80 percent during illness. The law is part of wide-reaching government savings measures.  </p>
<p>SPD parliamentary deputy Robert Leidinger said &quot;the goal of the party's initiative is that we return to paying full salaries and that workers do not have to give up any benefits.&quot;</p>
<p>While some employers have reported a significant drop in employee sick leave since October, unions immediately called for wild cat strikes to protest the 20 percent cut in benefits which they said violated existing wage contracts.</p>
<p>Employers in most industries fired back by pulling forward the 1997 wage negotiations. After acrimonious negotiations, unions largely succeeded in forcing employers to return to full wage payments in return for cuts in other benefits.</p>
<p>Leidinger accused the Kohl government of having poisoned the atmosphere for the annual wage negotiations and for having provoked the wild cat strikes, which mostly hit the automobile industry.</p>
<p>&quot;People must not be made into tools in order to promote business interests,&quot; Leidinger warned, adding the Kohl government is not facing the social realities in Germany.</p>
