<headline>Lauren cache boosts shares in Wall Street debut.</headline>

<p>The stock of Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. jumped on Thursday, a day after the American design firm went public and charmed investors with its corporate image and fashions based on English elegance.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very strong company with a great brand name, international growth opportunities and a very diversified product line, so they don't have the same 'fashion risk' as some other designers,&quot; said Arden Armstrong, a money manager at Miller Anderson &amp; Sherrerd LLP.</p>
<p>The stock, priced at $26 late on Wednesday, rose $5.25 to $31.25 at midday and was the most active issue in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where more than 17.1 million shares changed hands.</p>
<p>Lauren, a former necktie salesman from the Bronx, rang the opening bell to signal the start of trading at the exchange.</p>
<p>Investors clamoured for stock in the company, whose strong Polo brand name, established menswear line, growing line of womenswear and growth opportunities around the globe promise returns as rich as the ambience of its print advertisements.</p>
<p>Unlike Gucci Group NV and Donna Karan International Inc., design houses which have also gone public, Ralph Lauren has branched out from traditional apparel to sell products such as towels, sheets, bedspreads and even paint.</p>
<p>The success of building a brand name to go on any product -- starting with the designer himself who changed his name from Ralph Lifshitz -- extended to Wall Street.</p>
<p>Strong demand pushed up the price of the stock from an estimated $22 to $26, and allowed underwriters to offer 29.5 million shares, making it the second largest initial pubic offering this year. Santa Fe International Corp. holds that record after raising nearly $1 billion in an IPO on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Of the total shares, the New York-based design company sold 9.4 million, raising $244.4 million. But the lion's share was sold by the designer himself and Goldman Sachs, which held a 28 percent stake before the IPO.</p>
<p>Despite the size of the deal, however, the strong interest by individual investors left even portfolio managers at some of the top U.S. investment banks empty handed.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very disappointed and even annoyed. I got nothing and I put in for a lot and I put in early,&quot; said Peggy Farley, chief executive of Amas Securities.</p>
<p>With piecemeal allocations, some institutions decided to &quot;flip&quot; the stock for short-term gains instead of holding them as long-term investments, which would provide a strong support for the stock price during rough periods when smaller investors might sell.</p>
<p>&quot;Institutions got very small allocations based on a 30 million share deal. That's a negative. I'm bailing out now,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>But Armstrong of Miller Anderson, a Conshohocken, Pa., fund that manages more than $41 billion, said she got 250,000 shares and predicted growth in Polo's menswear business in 1998 after a restructuring, even though she expects flat operating margins in 1997.</p>
<p>Revenues at Ralph Lauren grew to $1.2 billion in the year ended in March 1997 from about $1 billion a year earlier, while earnings jumped to $117.3 million from $98.8 million.</p>
<p>Despite Polo's strengths, some analysts have knocked the deal, saying the price was too steep, especially when compared with Tommy Hilfiger Corp., a sportswear designer which, like Ralph Lauren, has spun success out of styling for the masses rather than through innovative design.</p>
<p>But Alan Millstein, editor and publisher of the Fashion Report, warned about betting on the fashion industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Wall Street never learns. With the exception of Gucci Group, which has defied all the odds, and Liz Claiborne Inc., no fashion brand has ever lasted more than 20 years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like betting on a film studio. It may be great at the box office today but you better have great product in the pipeline,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gucci stock has more than tripled from its IPO, while Donna Karan International's has tumbled 50 percent.</p>
