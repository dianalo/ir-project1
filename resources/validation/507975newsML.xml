<p>Ireland's Independent Newspapers plans to seek a 20 percent black equity partner for its South African subsidiary, Independent Newspapers Holdings , before the end of the year, senior executive Ivan Fallon said on Monday.    </p>
<p>Fallon, who will take over as chief executive of the South African company in July, told Reuters the parent company would not surrender control or reduce its holding significantly below its current 60 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably it would involve new shares. There are a half dozen different schemes we have looked at, but it's quite difficult without issuing new shares. You can't ask or demand that your existing shareholders sell off your own shares,&quot; he said after a National Assembly workshop on foreign media holdings in South Africa.</p>
<p>The remaining 40 percent of Independent Newspapers Holdings is owned largely by Old Mutual, the country's biggest investment institution.</p>
<p>The Irish company headed by Tony O'Reilly bought a 39 percent stake in South Africa's Argus Newspapers from Anglo American Corp in November 1994 and, at a cost 136.5 million rand, increased its stake to 60 percent in March 1995.</p>
<p>O'Reilly said before increasing his stake that he would bid for the whole company and would set aside anything above 60 percent, up to a maximum of 20 percent, for a black empowerment programme.</p>
<p>&quot;In the event, we didn't get anything above 60 pct, but that has been in our minds ever since,&quot; Fallon said.</p>
<p>He said details of the offer were still being thrashed out and no deal had been structured.</p>
<p>&quot;We're ruling nothing out and I think we're very open on this. We're very interested in a deal at the top, which we think is genuine empowerment, but we're not interested in surrendering control.</p>
<p>&quot;We are here to drive, manage and control Independent Newspapers. We are putting a lot of management effort and expertise into it and we're not easily going to surrender that.</p>
<p>&quot;What we do want is black partners who will help us to develop new ventures. We want a deal that adds value to both sides,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Independent Newspapers controls the majority of South Africa's English language daily and weekly newspapers, mainly targeting white readers.</p>
<p>Fallon said the company was negotiating the sale of its minority stake in the top-selling black Sowetan newspaper and was exploring &quot;as a matter of urgency&quot; proposals to launch a popular national daily tabloid.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been talking to Times Media Ltd about them buying up the Sowetan, but if they don't offer the right price then we're not going to sell. There are a number of other options,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Fallon said Independent would decide on the sale of the Sowetan and the launch of a new title this year.</p>
<p>&quot;What we would probably do is launch it ourselves and then take in minority black partners or a 50-50 partner. I think it would be very unfair with a high-risk project like that to find a black partner and say come in with us at that stage.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it is an area for black empowerment at this point. If we get it up and running, I think that is the time to look for black partners,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Fallon confirmed during the workshop with legislators that African National Congress (ANC) leader Nelson Mandela, who became South Africa's first black president in 1994, was directly involved in negotiations for Independent's initial purchase.</p>
<p>He said the proposed national daily would, if the project went ahead, &quot;represent to a large degree the basic principles that the ANC represents&quot;.</p>
