<headline>NYMEX electricity ends mostly up in seesaw session.</headline>

<p>NYMEX electricity futures settled mostly higher Friday in a seesaw session which the complex struggled for direction amid falling western physical prices and concerns over status of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS).</p>
<p>The 1,080 megawatt (MW) SONGS unit 3 remained off line with a restart expected Sunday night while engineers corrected a water contamination problem in the unit's lube oil system, the operator said.</p>
<p>The unit, in San Clemente, Calif., was earlier scheduled to return to service yesterday.</p>
<p>The adjacent 1,070 MW unit 2 was holding at 70 percent power while maintenance work on a main feedwater pump was being carried out.</p>
<p>There was growing belief that SONGS unit 3 may ultimately need to be shut to complete the pump repairs, traders said.</p>
<p>August Palo Verde (PV) futures settled up 14 cents at $36.82 a MWh after hitting resistance at $37.10 just 20 cents off its life-of-contract high.</p>
<p>September PV finished down nine cents at $29.11. Most deferred months were inactive.</p>
<p>August California-Oregon Border (COB) settled down 14 cents at $21.90 after bouncing between $21.80 and $22.15.</p>
<p>September COB finished up six cents at $22.19. Other COB contracts ended five to 20 cents higher.</p>
<p>Firm, peak electricity prices for Saturday/Monday at PV slipped $10.00 to $39.00-44.00 a MWh, while those at COB lost a dollar to $16.25-17.25 ahead of lower weekend demand.</p>
<p>Market sources said they were unsure about the direction of complex due to ongoing uncertainty at SONGS.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really hard to tell with the San Onofre situation,&quot; a West Coast power trader said.</p>
<p>In generation news, output at the 1,158 MW WNP-2 nuclear power plant in Richland, Washington, rose to 92 percent of capacity as of early Friday.</p>
<p>The 750 MW Mohave coal-fired unit 3, which was shut Monday for repairs, was expected to resume operations Saturday.</p>
<p>The 254 MW Valmy coal-fired unit 1 in Nevada was unlikely to return to full power until the weekend, after its output was halved Tuesday because of a tube leak.</p>
<p>There was talk of a 700 MW unit at the Colstrip coal-fired power plant in Montana going off line over the weekend for unplanned repairs, but this could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>A 446 MW unit at the Huntington coal-fired plant in Utah was also said to be shut for short-term repair work.</p>
<p>Separately, southbound capacity on the AC segment of the Pacific Intertie transmission system was set for a250 MW cut to 3,200 MW today between 0900 and 1600 PDT for maintenance.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the Southwest were expected to average near seasonal levels next week, while those in Northwest would run normal to above normal.</p>
