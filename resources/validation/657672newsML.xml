<headline>Calif. lawmakers meet on budget, no deal in sight.</headline>
<dateline>SACRAMENTO, Calif. 1997-06-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>California Gov. Pete Wilson and leaders of the state Senate and Assembly held their first fiscal 1997-98 budget talks Wednesday and said they would meet again in a week, dashing any hope of a deal by June 15, the state's Constitutional budget deadline.</p>
<p>The senior state lawmakers, known collectively as the &quot;Big Five,&quot; met for less than an hour before adjourning. They scheduled their next budget meeting for June 19.  </p>
<p>State Assembly Speaker Cruz Bustamante, a Democrat and a member of the Big Five, told reporters he hoped the state's budget conference committee would be able to resolve most of the spending disputes in the coming days.</p>
<p>The conference committee -- made up of three senators and three assembly members -- held its second hearing Wednesday and was expected to meet daily until an agreement was reached. The committee's goal is to meld the budget packages of the state Assembly and Senate into a single spending plan.</p>
<p>The state Constitution calls for the legislature to approve the final budget by June 15. But in recent years the deadline has often been missed.</p>
<p>Observers in Sacramento said it was clear the deadline would be missed again this year.</p>
