<p>Nazi Germany sold more than $700 million of looted gold -- worth about $7 billion at 1997 prices -- to the neutral nations of Europe during the Second World War, according to an analysis of wartime documents that have been turned over to the U.S. government.</p>
<p>An internal memorandum prepared by the World Jewish Congress (WJC), based on British and American documents found in more than a year-long hunt through the U.S. National Archives, said Switzerland bought the most gold from Germany followed by Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Turkey.</p>
<p>The memorandum, obtained by Reuters on Monday, also says the five countries gave back less than 10 percent of the gold after the war.</p>
<p>The documents on which the memorandum was based have been given to the Justice Department, one of several government agencies preparing a report on Switzerland's financial dealings with the Nazis under the direction of Stuart Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade.</p>
<p>The report is due to be published next month.</p>
<p>According to the WJC memorandum, Switzerland received about $325 million in gold looted from central banks plus more than $100 million it laundered for the Germans during the war. In a 1946 agreement with the United States, France and Britain, the Swiss returned $58 million.</p>
<p>The memorandum said Portugal received $139 million and in 1953, after years of refusing to admit that any gold it received had been looted, gave the Allies $5 million.</p>
<p>Spain received about $100 million but returned only $100,000, the memo said. It added that Sweden received $23 million and returned $8 million while Turkey bought $10 million in gold from the Nazis and gave back about $1 million after the war.</p>
<p>The memo estimated that the Germans also looted up to $60 million in gold from individuals -- including gold confiscated from victims in Nazi death camps.</p>
<p>Documents captured by the Allies after the war reported that the Nazis melted this gold down into ingots that were included in German Reichsbank gold stocks.</p>
<p>Some historians have claimed that if the Nazis had not been able to sell the gold it looted from conquered countries to the neutral nations, it would not have been able to buy the raw materials it needed for its war effort.</p>
<p>The Eizenstat report is widely expected to be critical of the Swiss wartime role and of a 1946 treaty in which the neutral nation gave the Allies $58 million to compensate for its handling of gold looted by the Nazis during the war.</p>
<p>British government documents released by the WJC last Friday said Portugal refused after the Second World War to give up looted gold it received from Nazi Germany even though close to four tons of Dutch gold remained in its original wrappers in Portugese vaults.</p>
<p>The 1947 documents said Portugal refused to return the looted gold or even admit it was looted.</p>
<p>In 1953, after years of pressure, Portugal gave up four tons of gold worth $5 million even though the Allies said it had received $139 million worth of gold from the Germans.</p>
<p>One British embassy document, dated June 2, 1947, said, &quot;There is no possibility whatever of persuading the Portuguese to restitute the full quantity proved to have been looted as the economy of that country could not sustain such a loss. We will therefore have to be satisfied with a compromise settlement.&quot;</p>
