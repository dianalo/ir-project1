<headline>MAN truck unit faces tough domestic market.</headline>

<p>MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the truck making unit of Germany's MAN AG, said on Thursday a difficult European commercial vehicle market will leave it with lower sales and profits in the 1996/97 business year.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference, chairman Rudolf Rupprecht said he expected a &quot;clear decline&quot; in earnings this year with sales expected to fall six percent and output to decline 10 percent.</p>
<p>The setback comes only months after the unit reported a 10 percent sales increase for the 1995/96 business year to just under eight billion marks ($5.3 billion) and pre-tax profits of 260 million marks.</p>
<p>Rupprecht did not say what specific profit figure the company would be able to report for this fiscal year ending June 30, but said it would be satisfactory.</p>
<p>The chairman said he hoped that business would improve in the second half of the year when new models were expected to stimulate demand, especially from domestic customers.</p>
<p>But incoming orders in the first quarter of the 1996/97 year where down one percent to 1.7 billion marks and sales stood at 1.62 billion marks.</p>
<p>MAN, which has been considering expanding foreign production to offset the high cost of producing in Germany, said it planed to start building buses in Poland and would invest 30 million marks there.</p>
<p>The truck maker accounts for about 40 percent of MAN AG's annual revenues.</p>
<p>MAN, like other truck makers, has been hurt by weak demand for heavy commercial vehicles throughout Europe and especially in Germany where a weak economy has reduced demand for hauling goods.</p>
<p>Its shares fell nearly four percent in bourse trade on Thursday after a profit warning in its truck division, ending at 384.80 marks, down 16 marks or 3.9 percent.</p>
