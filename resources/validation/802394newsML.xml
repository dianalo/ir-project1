<headline>UPS, Teamsters talking, union says no settlement.</headline>

<p>United Parcel Service and the Teamsters stepped up negotiations Friday, but the union said key disputes in the bitter strike had not been settled and called on members to &quot;build strength on the picket lines.&quot;</p>
<p>With the strike in its 12th day, the nation's biggest package delivery service and its second-largest union redoubled their efforts to reach a settlement, said Susan King, spokeswoman for Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.</p>
<p>The two sides negotiated all day Thursday and into the early hours of Friday, then took a break for a few hours before resuming.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the fact that they've been sitting for 20-1/2 hours talking, crunching numbers, moving back and forth between ... rooms (means it) is clear that they are redoubling their efforts,&quot; King said.</p>
<p>But the union sent a memo to its branches stressing the marathon talks have yet to resolve key issues in the strike by 185,000 Teamsters. It urged the offices to continue to &quot;build strength on the picket lines and in the community.&quot;</p>
<p>Teamster President Ron Carey said that no agreements were reached but that the talks, which he labeled &quot;still informal,&quot; would continue.</p>
<p>&quot;It's obvious that there have been no agreements reached,&quot; Carey said at a news conference. &quot;However, I will continue to negotiate as long as there is hope.&quot;</p>
<p>He said there was no evidence UPS had altered its so-called &quot;last, best and final&quot; offer.</p>
<p>At the White House, spokesman Mike McCurry declined to characterize the talks but noted: &quot;They're talking and that's good.&quot; UPS made no comment as the talks continued.</p>
<p>The strike was causing severe problems for some businesses and even for a blood bank.</p>
<p>A major blood bank group said it has destroyed more than 800 pints of blood because overburdened delivery companies Federal Express Corp. and Airborne Express could no longer guarantee their usual overnight delivery.</p>
<p>The group, America's Blood Centers, suggested its blood banks set up mobile collection units near UPS picket lines so that striking UPS workers can donate blood.</p>
<p>About 185,000 UPS workers have been on strike since Aug. 4 to demand full-time status and benefits for some of the company's many part-time employees. The walkout is one of the biggest this decade.</p>
<p>The strike is putting increasing pressure on both sides.</p>
<p>The company estimates it is losing $300 million a week, putting its losses so far at about $500 million. UPS carried 80 percent of the small packages in the United States before the strike. It has tried to keep priority deliveries such as medical supplies going with management help, but its volume has shrunk to about 10 percent of normal.</p>
<p>The strikers themselves are getting help from other unions, but finding it tough to live on $55-a-week strike benefits.</p>
<p>Opinion polls suggest the public sympathizes more with the strikers than with the company. Many small businesses are feeling the pinch of being unable to deliver their goods. Some have laid off workers or lost substantial business.</p>
<p>UPS competitors have rushed to try to fill the void. The U.S. Postal Service said Friday it would continue Sunday deliveries in some areas of the United States to handle increased mail volume as a result of the strike.</p>
<p>Until late this week, UPS took a hard line in the negotiations, insisting that the union put the company's last contract offer to a membership vote and calling on President Bill Clinton to use his powers to stop the strike.</p>
<p>But Clinton has refused to intervene and UPS appeared to soften its stance Thursday, suggesting its &quot;final&quot; offer was negotiable.</p>
