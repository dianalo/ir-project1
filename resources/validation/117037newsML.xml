<p>President Yasser Arafat hosted an Arab head of state for the first time on Palestinian-ruled soil on Tuesday, voicing doubts about a breakthrough with Israel on the impasse over Hebron.</p>
<p>Israeli officials, saying good progress had been made, dismissed Arafat's pessimism as a negotiating tactic.</p>
<p>Jordan's King Hussein flew a helicopter, with Arafat as his passenger, from Amman to the town of Jericho on his first trip to the West Bank since he lost the territory to Israel in the Six-Day War 29 years ago. He stayed nearly four hours.</p>
<p>&quot;Until now, there is no progress in any of the committees in the negotiations,&quot; Arafat said of Palestinian peace talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, speaking to reporters in Jerusalem later, said he hoped outstanding issues on Hebron could be resolved this week.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been very good progress in the talks,&quot; Netanyahu's media adviser David Bar-Illan told the Cable News Network.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a Palestinian tactic which we are familiar with...to create a crisis at the very last minute and to bring in something as astonishing as that idea of American troops.&quot;</p>
<p>Arafat said he was ready for U.S. troops to join an international force to guard the 400 Jewish settlers in Hebron, a city of 100,000 Arabs, to calm Israeli security fears.</p>
<p>&quot;I told them, okay, if you don't trust the joint mobile units and you don't trust your soldiers or our soldiers, okay, why not call upon the international presence with the participation of the American army?&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>Bar-Illan said the proposal &quot;may actually cause the deaths of American soldiers in this area and I doubt very much whether bringing home American troops to America in body bags is going to...further... the peace process.&quot;</p>
<p>The Palestinian Authority refuses to reopen the Hebron agreement signed by the Israeli government ousted by Netanyahu last May. Israel has denied it seeks to renegotiate the deal but its requested changes violate the original terms.</p>
<p>The king, Israel's closest Arab ally since making peace in 1994, has lately distanced himself from the right-wing Netanyahu who took office in June vowing a tougher line.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to see a speeding up of the implementation of everything that had been agreed upon and to continue until we achieve a just and lasting peace on the Palestinian-Israeli track,&quot; the king told reporters.</p>
<p>Both Arafat and King Hussein denied there were any efforts to arrange a three-way meeting with Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Arafat joined the king in saluting a Palestinian honour guard while a Gaza band played the national anthems of both Jordan and the Palestinians. Hundreds applauded.</p>
<p>&quot;This is my first visit to Palestine. I'm overwhelmed by the warmth of of the reception and the feelings which I fully reciprocate as do the government and the people of Jordan,&quot; the king said.</p>
<p>In 1988, in the heat of the Palestinian uprising, King Hussein gave up all claims to the West Bank, home to a million Palestinians. Jericho, 24 km (14 miles) northeast of Jerusalem, was the first West Bank town handed over to Arafat's Palestinian Authority in 1994 under peace deals with Israel.</p>
<p>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators meeting since last week in informal discussions were due to hold formal talks on Wednesday in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba.</p>
