<p>Current Texas-El Paso coach Don Haskins, former Princeton coach Pete Carril and Spanish coaching legend Antonio Diaz-Miguel were among seven individuals inducted Monday into the Basketball Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Joining Carril, Haskins and Diaz-Miguel were Denver Nuggets standout Alex English, 12-year NBA player Bailey Howell and women's stars Denise Curry and Joan Crawford.</p>
<p>The inductees needed 18 of 24 votes from the Honours Committee for induction. Enshrinement ceremonies will be held here on September 29.</p>
<p>Haskins accelerated integration in U.S. college basketball in 1966 when Texas-El Paso, then called Texas Western, started five black players and beat Kentucky in the NCAA Championship game. Kentucky, coached by the legendary Adolph Rupp, had an all-white starting five.</p>
<p>In his 35 years at the school, Haskins has compiled a 687-322 record.</p>
<p>Carril became a legend during his 29 years at Princeton after arriving at the Ivy League school in 1967. He is the only coach to record 500 victories at the Division I level without the benefit of athletic scholarships. His disciplined, fundamental style brought fear into almost every big-name programme that the Tigers played in the NCAA Tournament.</p>
<p>Diaz-Miguel coached the Spanish national team for 27 years and six Olympiads, capturing a silver medal in the 1984 Olympics at Los Angeles.</p>
<p>His teams were in 14 European championships and four world championships, placing second in 1973 and 1983 and third in 1991. He coached six European All-Star teams in the 1980s and is one of the pioneers of promoting basketball in Europe.</p>
<p>English, an eight-time All-Star, was the first player in NBA history to score 2,000 points in eight straight seasons. He ranks ninth all-time with 25,613 career points and was the leading in the decade of the 1980s with 19,682 points.</p>
<p>Howell, nominated by the veteran's committee, was a standout player for 12 years with the Detroit Pistons, Baltimore Bullets, Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers from 1959-71. He finished with 17,770 points and 9,383 rebounds.</p>
<p>Curry was a four-year starter and a three-time All-America at UCLA from 1978-81. She averaged 24.6 points and 10.1 rebounds and is still the school's all-time leading scorer and rebounder with 3,198 points and 1,310 rebounds.</p>
<p>Crawford was a star of the Amateur Athletic Union from 1957-69, playing one season with Detroit and 12 in her hometown of Nashville. A 5-11 (1.80 m) centre was named to the All-America team all 13 seasons and helped Nashville win 10 championships.</p>
