<p>Early details from Thailand's economic rescue package released on Tuesday had some surprises for financial markets, but eagerly awaited news of just how much credit had been arranged with the IMF and others was conspicuous by its absence.</p>
<p>Thai stocks plunged more than 4.0 percent and the baht sank in immediate reaction to news that a further 42 finance companies were to suspend operations -- in addition to 16 already suspended -- and the central bank would guarantee their debt repayments and deposits.  </p>
<p>Both the number of firms involved -- there are 91 finance firms in Thailand -- and the outright guarantee to cover any outstanding debt surprised the market.</p>
<p>The market's first question was; Where is the money going to come from to fund such an operation, given that it was also announced that Thai finance companies had already borrowed almost 500 billion baht from the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;To guarantee debt like this means there has to be a credible story,&quot; said Chiang Yao Chye, Head of Asia Pacific Research at CIBC in Singapore.  </p>
<p>&quot;The big credit line that everyone is expecting has to be substantial enough for this whole thing to be successful as far as boosting market confidence is concerned,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Banking analysts in Singapore thought the number of failures involved was a fair reflection of the scale of the problem. &quot;It is in line with our analysis,&quot; said one. &quot;It shows there is a willingness to deal with the depth of the problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said given the amount of short-debt due to mature in the coming months -- less that due to Tokyo, likely to be rolled over becaue of Japan's substantial interests in Thailand -- credit lines of close to $20 billion will be necessary for  </p>
<p>this package to be credible.</p>
<p>&quot;That is assuming that foreign reserves hold above $20 billion, and we don't really know how low that figure is going to go,&quot; CIBC's Chaing said.</p>
<p>In June, Thailand's reserves stood at $32.4 billion and part of Tuesday's announcement was that it would seek $12-15 billion in foreign loans to replenish the coffers.</p>
<p>An IMF credit line would likely take the form of stand-by credit and only a share of it would be available immediately, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Any remaining funds would act as a guarantee if contributions from other sources proved insufficient. The loan would go into reserves and thereby support the pool to finance the balance of payments.</p>
<p>The IMF credit line would not be the entire package but analysts reckon it will stump up between $5-$10 billion with the balance, which on a worst case scenario would be another $10 billion, made up from credit line form other sources.</p>
<p>Given Japanse banks had more than $37 billion outstanding credit to Thailand at the end of last year, the authorities there will be keen to extend a helping hand to the Thais.  </p>
<p>Other measures that were announced, such as a rise in Value Added Tax to 10 percent from 7.0 percent, balancing the budget and bringing down the current account deficit, were good news for the markets in the longer term, analysts said.</p>
<p>The baht sank to 31.700 per dollar onshore from around 31.00 before the news and the outlook for the beleaguered currency is not bright despite the fact that Thailand has bitten the bullet.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't expect to see significant appreciation of the baht,&quot; said Chan Chia Lin, head of economic research at ABN-Amro Bank in Singapore.  </p>
<p>&quot;These measures, though positive for the longer term, are going to mean short-term pain. The government has acknowledged that growth will come down quite sharply,&quot; she said. &quot;But for now, the fear of dollar/baht reaching 35 has probably subsided somewhat.&quot;</p>
<p>There was no news on the scrapping of capital controls which created the baht's two-tier foreign exchange system.</p>
