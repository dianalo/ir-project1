<p>GEC Alsthom wants to challenge General Electric Co of the U.S. through its planned merger with state-owned Framatome and by extending a relationship with Germany's Siemens, chairman Pierre Bilger told the La Tribune Desfosses newspaper in an interview.</p>
<p>GEC Alsthom is a joint-venture between General Electric Plc of Britain and Alcatel Alsthom of France.</p>
<p>Alcatel has a 44 percent stake in Framatome and on August 30 received government permission to start merger talks between GEC Alsthom and Framatome.</p>
<p>Framatome management is against the deal.</p>
<p>Bilger said the merger would create a group active in both conventional power and nuclear power, capable to compete on the world stage.</p>
<p>Big foreign competitors Siemens, General Electric (GE), Westinghouse, ABB, Mitsubishi al had in-house e al had in-house expertise on energy production, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If GE keeps its nuclear capabilities, If ABB does the same, it's because they are convinced that it is important to be in nuclear as well,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Quarrels about the independence of this or that company are outdated. In the U.S. there is just one, maybe two, players left in this field -- GE and Westinghouse. In Europe, we are five among which two French companies that play on their own,&quot; Bilger said.</p>
<p>&quot;What is at stake is the creation of a big European electrotechnical group, majority-owned by French interests, which will become the real challenger of General Electric (Co),&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;In this light, the alliance with Siemens for the development of the future European nuclear reactor is a key element of the strategy of Framatome,&quot; Bilger said.</p>
<p>He also said that while nuclear markets were currently in decline they would pick up again.</p>
<p>He said that while Framatome had played a key role in equipping France with nuclear stations, the market was moving away from Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets are going to Asia, South America and central and eastern Europe,&quot; Bilger said.</p>
<p>Framatome president Jean-Claude Leny told a Senate commission on October 31 that he did not believe there was any industrial logic behind the merger and feared that France would lose its independence in nuclear engineering if the deal went ahead.</p>
<p>Apart from Alcatel, Framatome owners are state-owned CEA with 36 percent, electricity utility EDF with eleven percent and the Consortium de Realisation (CDR) with four percent.</p>
