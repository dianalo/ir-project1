<headline>Canadian oil firm at center of Sudan intrigue.</headline>

<p>A two-year-old tale involving insurrection in Africa, high-level political maneuvering and deals won and lost in global financial markets is now catching the attention of Washington.</p>
<p>The possible prize is billions of barrels of oil, and behind the intrigue is a tiny Canadian oil company still awaiting its first profit.</p>
<p>Calgary, Alberta-based Arakis Energy Corp., headed by affable oilman John McLeod, wants nothing more than to start pumping oil from what it sees as the world's greatest energy project.</p>
<p>It is an extremely rocky road. Several investors left Arakis for dead in 1995 when financing collapsed for a 950-mile (1,529-km) oil pipeline to the Red Sea from oil fields in southern Sudan, arranged with a Saudi prince. That sparked a tailspin in its stock and the exit of its previous management.</p>
<p>A year later Arakis was reborn when it forged a $1 billion joint venture to develop the ex-Chevron Corp. lands, thought to hold up to 3.5 billion barrels, and build the pipeline.</p>
<p>Disappointment followed when Arakis revealed that a U.S.-based company, widely speculated as Occidental Petroleum Corp., was kicked out of the talks by Sudan's government.</p>
<p>U.S. government sources said at the time that a U.S. decision to send $20 million in military aid to neighboring states -- in what was alleged to be indirect support for Sudanese rebel forces -- was a likely reason behind Khartoum's forcing Occidental out of the deal.</p>
<p>In August 1996, Sudan was exempted from broad trade sanctions in the new U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act, a move that the Washington Post reported last week may have been fueled by Occidental's desire to negotiate the deal.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns last week denied the allegations, asserting Sudan and Syria were not subject to the &quot;comprehensive&quot; sanctions imposed on Libya, Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Cuba.</p>
<p>Final consortium members included the state oil companies of China and Malaysia, countries friendly to Sudan's Islamic government, which also has a stake in the project.</p>
<p>Just as Arakis began to regain credibility by stressing the group's seriousness about the project, three of its most prominent senior executives resigned on Dec. 26.</p>
<p>This month tensions between the Khartoum government and Sudanese rebel groups exploded. It was yet another setback for Arakis Chief Executive McLeod.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody says we should get out and get exploring and that will boost our stock. We get a nice discovery and then all the press reports started about the fighting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A rebel offensive along the Ethiopian border launched two weeks ago escalated Sudan's 14-year civil strife, with Khartoum accusing Ethiopia and Eritrea of aiding the opposition forces.</p>
<p>The fighting is several hundred miles northeast of Arakis's Heglig and Unity oil fields, from which the consortium plans to build the pipeline that would carry as much as 250,000 barrels of oil a day by the year 2000.</p>
<p>But analysts, many of whom believe strongly in Arakis's long-term prospects, said investor jitters over the conflict had kept the company's share price in the same low range.</p>
<p>Arakis has received several threats to its operations from the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the country's largest and oldest rebel group, which has been fighting government forces in the mostly Christian south since 1983. The SPLA and human rights groups have criticized the project for its potential to pump revenues into Khartoum's coffers to fuel the war.</p>
<p>Despite the risks, U.S. companies seemed more interested than ever to explore for Sudan's oil, market sources said.</p>
<p>Sources close to Arakis have said Occidental, in concert with another Canadian company, Vancouver-based International Petroleum Corp., was widely speculated to be negotiating for a concession near the Arakis project in a deal that could include taking a stake in the planned pipeline.</p>
<p>IPC President Ian Lundin confirmed from Geneva on Friday that his firm was in talks on a Sudan oil venture and was looking at nearby lands, a stake in the pipeline -- &quot;the whole ball of wax.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if a deal would include Occidental, Lundin responded: &quot;You would have to ask them.&quot;</p>
<p>Officials at Occidental declined comment.</p>
<p>A U.S. administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, recently told Reuters he was not surprised Occidental was still interested in Sudan. &quot;They are not dissuaded. They're an aggressive business group,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty, many investors refuse to sell their Arakis shares. &quot;This is almost like a cult stock -- it's the stock you love to hate,&quot; said one loyal U.S. stockholder. &quot;It may take five years, but the oil potential there is huge.&quot;</p>
<p>Arakis was trading at $3.25 on Nasdaq on Monday.</p>
