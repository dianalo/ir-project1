<p>ASM Lithography Holding NV said on Wednesday its market share had grown during the first half of 1997 and it had a positive outlook for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;ASML's market share is growing as ASML landed new customers during the first half of 1997. We are pleased with our prospects for the year,&quot; CEO Willem Maris said in a statement with the company's 1997 half-year results.</p>
<p>The company, which makes equipment for the production of semiconductors, previously said it was uncertain about its growth prospects for 1997 but expected an improvement in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;After a slow start in 1997, business conditions have solidified and the company is building backlog,&quot; Maris said.</p>
<p>&quot;In line with semiconductor market growth expectations, we are seeing in particular the ramp-up of Deep UV photolithography, which is the enabling factor in semiconductor manufacturers' continuing efforts to increase circuit densities, improve functionality and reduce manufacturing cost.&quot;</p>
<p>ASM Lithography is 23.9 percent owned by Philips .</p>
