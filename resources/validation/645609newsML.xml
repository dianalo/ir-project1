<p>Independent record company Immediate Entertainment Group Inc said on Monday it was considering a float on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) and pledged to liven up the music market.</p>
<p>The group said it intended to list on NASDAQ in August and is also preparing to raise $5 million via a private placing.</p>
<p>The proposed placing is being handled by German investment bank Falken Vermogensberatung and the group said the proceeds would be used to fund acquisitions.</p>
<p>Immediate is headed by Tony Calder, a former DJ and pop manager, who said he planned to sign new bands and put fresh energy into the music market.</p>
<p>&quot;We are close to getting some sensational acts,&quot; Calder told Reuters. &quot;Of course you need to market bands well but you must create demand and that is what we intend to do.&quot;</p>
<p>Calder, in partnership with former Rolling Stones manager Andrew Oldham, set up Immediate Records in 1965 and helped to develop acts such as Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart and The Small Faces.</p>
<p>Immediate, which operates in a number of countries, has developed into an integrated record company with studios, CD plant and in-house marketing, sales and distribution systems.</p>
<p>The group's shares started trading on the OTC bulletin board in the United States in October 1996 at $3 and are currently trading around $4.</p>
<p>The record company is also considering a flotation on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange as an alternative to AIM.</p>
