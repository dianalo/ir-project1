<title>SINGAPORE: WTO ministers on last lap toward labour agreement.</title>
<headline>WTO ministers on last lap toward labour agreement.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1996-12-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Trade ministers said on Thursday they were making progress toward agreement on the vexed question of core labour standards, one of the last issues to be settled at the World Trade Organisation's inaugural ministerial meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;We're really making progress. The last lap has begun,&quot; European trade commissioner Sir Leon Brittan told reporters.</p>
<p>He was speaking after a meeting with acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, who agreed with the upbeat assessment. &quot;We're making very great progress,&quot; she said.  </p>
<p>Ministers from a number of other countries, including Malaysia, India and Singapore had joined the EU and U.S. negotiators to try to thrash out compromise language on the link between trade and labour standards.</p>
<p>India, which had initially refused to entertain any mention of the subject in the conference's final declaration, was now prepared to tolerate its inclusion.</p>
<p>&quot;Serious efforts have been made to include the key concerns of developed and developing countries. The trend is certainly positive,&quot; a senior Indian official told Reuters.  </p>
<p>India and other developing countries fear that rich countries want to impose global labour standards as a back-door way of eroding their chief competitive advantage -- low wages.</p>
<p>The United States, supported by a number of European countries including France, insist that their voters' concerns over child labour and sweatshop conditions must be tackled to maintain public support for global free trade.</p>
