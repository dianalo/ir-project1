<title>ISRAEL: Palestinians take first bite of U.S. fast food.</title>
<headline>Palestinians take first bite of U.S. fast food.</headline>
<dateline>AL-BIREH, West Bank 1996-11-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Palestinians in the West Bank are getting their first taste of American fast food.</p>
<p>The Subway sandwich chain has opened its first branch in the Palestinian self-rule areas -- in Al-Bireh near Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;People like what we offer. We opened last Friday and we have had a good business since then,&quot; said Adnan Bahhour, a Palestinian American who returned to the West Bank in February.</p>
<p>Bahhour said he obtained the Palestinian franchise from the Connecticut-based chain after being turned down by McDonald's and Burger King, hamburger chains with branches in Israel.</p>
<p>He said McDonald's cited political instability as the reason for its rejection, despite more than three years of Palestinian peacemaking with Israel.</p>
<p>Bahhour has a franchise for all of the Palestinian areas but obtains supplies from the Israeli agent who also supplies a Jordanian franchise.</p>
<p>The West Bank and Gaza have undergone a social revolution since Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority took charge in parts of the areas under a self-rule deal with Israel in 1994.</p>
<p>While reluctant to invest in risky businesses that depend on goodwill from Israel for imports and exports, Palestinian expatriates have poured their money into the building and service sectors.</p>
<p>Many Palestinian restaurants already serve American-style fast foods such as burgers, chicken and pizzas alongside traditional dishes such as houmous and felafel.</p>
<p>Restaurants offering local and western specialities have opened across the West Bank and Gaza Strip to serve a growing business community and expatriates accustomed to eating out.</p>
