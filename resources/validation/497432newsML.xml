<p>Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said on Wednesday Canberra was seeking radical improvement in trade and economic ties with South Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;We have announced 1997 as the year of South Asia,&quot; Fischer told a news conference in Dhaka before leaving for the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, capping a three-day visit to Bangladesh.</p>
<p>&quot;The coalition government in Australia is committed to build up trade and tourism ties with the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) countries. We have long overlooked the region. We are anxious to make up the lost time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Australian minister arrived in Dhaka on Monday from Pakistan on the second leg of his five-nation tour of South Asia.</p>
<p>Fischer, travelling with a 19-member trade team, will visit India and Nepal after Bhutan.</p>
<p>Australian diplomats in Dhaka said Fischer was visiting the SAARC member countries to assess the potential of their economies for becoming trade partners with Australia.</p>
<p>In Dhaka, Fischer held meetings with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, several ministers and opposition politicians.</p>
<p>Fischer witnessed the signing of a deal between an Australian company and a Bangladeshi firm for a $24 million textile factory in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Representatives of Bradmill Textile of Melbourne and Bangladesh's Multimode Group struck the deal in Dhaka on Monday to produce 10 million metres of denim fabrics annually for export.</p>
<p>&quot;Many more joint venture deals will follow,&quot; Fischer told reporters without elaborating.</p>
<p>He said Australian investors were familiar with Bangladesh's &quot;commercial legal structure&quot;, which they might find favourable for investing in this country.</p>
<p>During official talks on Monday, Fischer and Bangladesh's Commerce and Industry Minister Tofael Ahmed agreed to set up a joint commission to bolster bilateral trade and investment.</p>
<p>Ahmed asked for duty-free access of Bangladeshi products into the Australian market to bridge the gap in bilateral trade, which heavily tilts towards Canberra.</p>
<p>Bangladesh's imports from Australia stood at $127 million in the 1995/96 financial year (July-June) against exports of $24 million.</p>
<p>Bangladesh also sought Australia's backing for membership in the newly floated Indian Ocean Rim economic bloc.</p>
