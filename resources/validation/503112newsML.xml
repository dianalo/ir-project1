<p>Germany kept a low diplomatic profile on Friday over ties with Iran, saying it did not want to enflame the crisis sparked by a Berlin court verdict that Iran ordered the killing of four dissidents.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel repeatedly declined to answer questions on Germany's decision to expel four Iranian diplomats and a move by the European Union to recall ambassadors and break off &quot;critical dialogue&quot; with Iran.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to say anything -- for good reasons, in such a charged situation,&quot; Kinkel told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have responsibilty for the 530 Germans living in Iran,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said. &quot;It's not in our interests to pour oil on to the fire in the current situation.&quot;</p>
<p>The reason for Bonn's concerns was powerfully underscored when around 3,000 hardline Islamists marched to the German embassy in Tehran after Friday prayers, throwing tomatoes and chanting slogans in protest at the verdict.</p>
<p>Germany, wary of reprisals, has advised its citizens not to travel to Iran. But the Iranian ambassador to Germany, speaking shortly before he returned to Tehran for consultations, said Iran would work hard to defuse the current situation.</p>
<p>&quot;Germans can feel secure in Iran,&quot; Hossein Moussavian said in an interview for Saturday's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, reaffirming earlier assurances from Tehran.</p>
<p>&quot;We're taking the Iranian leadership at its word on this matter and we've no reason to doubt it up until now,&quot; Erdmann told reporters. &quot;We don't want to give any reason to change that situation.&quot;</p>
<p>When a German prosecutor accused Iran last year of ordering the 1992 killings, an angry mob marched on Germany's Tehran embassy, hurling eggs and stones.</p>
<p>Iran has condemned the verdict and denied it is involved in terrorism. It has ordered four German diplomats out of the country and recalled its ambassador in Bonn for consultations.</p>
<p>In a statement on Thursday, the foreign ministry in Bonn said the verdict portrayed a &quot;flagrant violation of international law&quot;. But it also said it hoped the situation would not escalate.</p>
<p>The verdict marked the first time a European court had clearly attributed political responsibility for any of the dozens of assassinations of Iranian opposition figures abroad since the Islamic revolution in 1979.</p>
<p>Presiding judge Frithjof Kubsch said in his ruling that the assassination the four Kurdish dissidents was ordered by a secret special operations committee whose members included Iran's president, its religious leader, intelligence minister and the head of foreign policy.</p>
<p>Kubsch stopped short of explicitly naming Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who prosecutors had accused of ultimate responsibility for the attack in Berlin's Mykonos restaurant.</p>
<p>Germany has been a staunch advocate of &quot;critical dialogue&quot;, a policy which means maintaining good relations and trade ties with Iran while also engaging in dialogue over human rights.</p>
<p>The policy is viewed with suspicion in Washington. The U.S. government favours a strategy of completely isolating Iran, which it accuses of sponsoring international terrorism.</p>
