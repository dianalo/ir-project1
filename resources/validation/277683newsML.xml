<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin expects Chinese President Jiang Zemin to visit Moscow in April for a summit that will seal a new level of relations between the two giant states, the Kremlin said on Friday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing the two leaders, together with presidents of the former Soviet republics of Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan would sign an accord reducing forces along their borders.</p>
<p>He gave no details about the timing or extent of troop reductions.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky said the timing of Jiang's visit was agreed during a 50-minute meeting between Yeltsin and Chinese Premier Li Peng earlier on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Boris Nikolayevich stated that relations between Russia and China have reached a new level,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>China and the former Soviet Union clashed along their border in the 1960s when the two nuclear powers were rivals for the leadership of the world communist movement.</p>
<p>Disputes over border demarcation were for the most part resolved in 1991 and Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin had promised to finalise the issue next year.</p>
<p>Li was the first foreign visitor to see Yeltsin since his return to work on Monday, following months of illness and a heart bypass operation on November 5.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very good that, out of all states, it was a guest from China who became the first visitor,&quot; Yastrzhembsky said, adding that Russian-Chinese relations were expanding and improving at an unprecedented rate.</p>
<p>Russia's desire to develop close links with China has followed NATO's plans to expand eastwards by admitting Moscow's Cold War allies in Eastern Europe as members of the alliance.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky said that Yeltsin and Li had agreed that the future political map of the globe should be &quot;a multi-pole world which is not divided into leaders and those who are being led&quot;.</p>
<p>Russia also views China as a key trading partner and both countries have shown interest in upgrading economic ties which have failed to keep pace with an improvement in political links.</p>
<p>Li was also due to meet Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin later on Friday. They are expected to arrange to hold regular talks, putting relations on a level that Moscow now has with only the United States and France.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has said more than once that he seeks a strategic partnership between Russia and China. But he has ruled out a revival of the close political and military alliance that had existed between Moscow and Beijing in 1950s.</p>
<p>China and Russia are working on a plan to increase cross-border trade by setting up a special zone in the northeastern Chinese city of Suifenhe that would allow free movement for traders.</p>
<p>The two nations are also negotiating over major deals from nuclear power plants to a natural gas pipeline, but political analysts said Li's visit was unlikely to yield a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Russia has proposed building a pipeline to carry Siberian natural gas to China and is seeking a role in China's huge Three Gorges dam project. It is also keen to sell military and civil aircraft to China.</p>
<p>First Deupty Prime Minister Alexei Bolshakov, quoted by Interfax news agency, said Russia and China planned to sign several documents during Li's visit concerning planned sales of Russia's Su-27 fighters. He gave no details.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin and Li had agreed to aim at bringing annual trade to the volume of $20 billion but he gave no details. Two-way trade was a modest $6.38 billion in the first nine months of this year.</p>
