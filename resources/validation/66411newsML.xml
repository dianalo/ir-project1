<p>Latin American shares were little changed on paltry U.S. volumes Friday as investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of next week's Fed meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;It is certainly very quiet. People are nervous that the Fed is going to raise rates at next Tuesday's meeting,&quot; a trader said.  </p>
<p>Brazil's Telebras was one of the region's biggest blue chip gainers, rising one percent, or 7/8 to 80-5/8 by early afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you're seeing a bit of short-covering there, with people squaring up their positions ahead of the week,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Most other Latin American shares barely moved, however, with Telmex's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) off 1/8 at 32-1/2, YPF down 1/8 at 22-7/8, Telefonica de Argentina up 1/4 at 25-1/4, and CTC sliding 1/4 to 98-3/8.  </p>
<p>Mexico's Televisa inched up 1/8 to 29-7/8 after the company said it would get $600 million in cash and an equity stake in the new PanAmSat company formed by PanAmSat and Hughes Electronics.</p>
<p>&quot;This has been expected for a while, so to a large extent, the news is already in the price,&quot; a trader said.</p>
