<p>Ridding Samsonite luggage of its &quot;boring&quot; image in the U.S. market is among Samsonite Corp's top priorities, Chief Executive Officer Richard Nicolosi said.</p>
<p>Samsonite has been &quot;too traditional, too conservative, too boring&quot; in the United States, Nicolosi told Reuters Friday.</p>
<p>He noted that Samsonite generates 40 percent of its revenues overseas. &quot;We have a whole host of drop dead beautiful styles in Japan and Europe,&quot; he said, adding he hopes those styles can revitalize the company's U.S. image.  </p>
<p>Nicolosi, who became Samsonite CEO after Steven Green stepped down in May, said the company's staff must do a better job of sharing successful design and marketing ideas from different regions of the world.</p>
<p>&quot;The company operated like a conglomerate. There was no cohesive strategy,&quot; said Nicolosi, who held positions with Scott Paper Co and Proctor &amp; Gamble before joining Samsonite.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Samsonite announced a major cost saving plan which will result in a $10.7 million charge in the third quarter and reduce its global workforce by 450 jobs.  </p>
<p>Samsonite said the restructuring should result in pre-tax savings of $0.78 per share, or $12.7 million, starting in November, 1997.</p>
<p>Under the plan, Denver-based Samsonite will consolidate hardside luggage production at its facility in Denver.</p>
<p>Nicolosi told Reuters Friday that Samsonite would bring more jobs to Colorado to take advantage of economies of scale, and added that the company's unions have agreed to company requests for more efficient work rules.  </p>
<p>He said he could not predict when the luggage maker would return to profitability. However, he did say &quot;if we don't turn a profit by early in the next fiscal year I will be very disapppointed.&quot;</p>
<p>With the streamlining plan expected to generate pre-tax savings of about $12.7 million per year, Nicolosi said Samsonite also wants to reduce its debt $50 million by the end of the next fiscal year. Debt currently stands at $300 million compared to $356 million a year ago, he said.</p>
