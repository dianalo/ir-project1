<title>FINLAND: NIINISTO NEGATIVE ON SAK'S EMU BUFFER FUND DEMAND.</title>
<headline>NIINISTO NEGATIVE ON SAK'S EMU BUFFER FUND DEMAND.</headline>
<dateline>HELSINKI 1996-11-18</dateline>

<p>Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto on Monday took a negative view of demands by trade union group, SAK, for buffer funds in exchange for union support for the government's drive to join EMU, eyewitnesses said.</p>
<p>&quot;The tone of his remarks on the buffer funds proposed by unions was negative,&quot; said one government official present at a union meeting, which Niinisto addressed without a prepared speech.</p>
<p>Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said other on-lookers had shared the view that Niinisto's stance was negative.</p>
<p>Niinisto had stressed that healthy public sector finances was the best way to  domestic room to manoueuvre to ease the impact of a sudden economic downturn, the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Niinisto) called for consensus on this and urged all parties to avoid distraint in the form of buffer funds for EMU,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Conservatibe Party chairman Niinisto's buffer fund-critical view is slightly out of tune with Social Democratic Party (SDP) chairman, Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen's remarks at an SDP council meeting on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many kinds of buffer funds. A current account surplus is one ...&quot; Lipponen said according to a prepared speech. &quot;The state budget must be brought into surplus,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;There can be other funds, too.&quot;</p>
<p>Lipponen did not elaborate, but some editorial writers interpreted his remarks as supportive of SAK's buffer funds.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is prepared to deal with EMU's labour-market related issues in the tripartite spirit,&quot; Lipponen said, referring to talks between unions, employer federations and the government.</p>
<p>Daily Helsingin Sanomat's editor-in-chief Janne Virkkunen said Lipponen had given the go-ahead for a round of bartering. Unions would eke out everything possible in exchange for supporting the political establishment's and employers' EMU bid, he wrote in a column.</p>
<p>&quot;The trade union movement has made its choice and it is going for the funds in exchange for Finnish EMU-membership,&quot; Virkkunen wrote.</p>
<p>At the SDP council, Lipponen said the council should for its part rule -- in principle -- on Finnish participation in the third phase of EMU before the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK) decides for itself, a decision due at SAK's regular autumn council meeing in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be good to time SDP's EMU decision before SAK's choice,&quot; Lipponen said, targetting an extraordinary SDP council meeting in May-June or September 1997.  </p>
<p>Lipponen also said the government would give to parliament a special report on EMU in spring 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Parliament's actual EMU-decision will, however, be made at the end of next year or early in 1998,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lipponen was quoted by Helsingin Sanomat as having told the SDP council meeting that parliament's decision whether Finland should join EMU will be made by simple majority. He had added that the legislature's constitutional committee's view on the decision-making procedure &quot;is important.&quot;</p>
<p>Niinisto, a former chairman of the constitutional committee, has earlier said a simple majority on EMU is sufficient.</p>
<p>Lipponen told the council that the social democrats' &quot;operative&quot; decision on EMU would be made by the party board and the parliamentary group ahead of the legislature's decision at the time when the EU is about to rule which countries qualify for EMU.</p>
<p>Analysts have said it would be very unlikely for the SDP parliamentary group to vote for EMU if SAK decided against.</p>
