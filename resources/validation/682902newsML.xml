<headline>Russia's Nemtsov says wants more trade with China.</headline>

<p>Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov urged an expansion of trade in talks with Chinese officials on Tuesday, saying the current level was inadequate.</p>
<p>Nemtsov, who is also minister of fuel and energy, was leading a delegation of nuclear energy and trade officials to prepare for a visit by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin later this week.</p>
<p>The delegation was expected to hammer out details of a deal for a multi-billion dollar project that could exploit Siberian natural gas to meet China's growing demand for energy, diplomats have said.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Thursday for a three-day visit during which he is expected to sign the natural gas agreement, they said.</p>
<p>In talks with Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, Nemtsov urged an expansion of bilateral trade, the Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>The current trade volume of less than $7.0 billion a year was too low and did not correspond to the size of the two countries, Nemtsov was quoted as telling Li.</p>
<p>Trade between the two neighbours was about $6.8 billion last year, with a surplus in China's favour. Beijing estimates that figure could reach $8-10 billion in 1997 and says it hopes the total will hit $20 billion by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin is to meet his Chinese counterpart Li Peng on June 27 after a stopover in Shenzhen, near the British territory of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>His visit is the latest in a string of high-level official exchanges between the two giant neighbours, following a trip to Moscow by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in April and a journey to China last spring by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>China once was a net oil exporter but speedy economic growth has fuelled demand for energy, with Chinese officials predicting oil imports could reach an annual 50 million tonnes by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Among other energy-related deals, a Russian consortium is vying for a contract to supply China with 14 generators with a total installed capacity of 9,800 megawatts for the gargantuan Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Beijing and Moscow have also agreed to build a multi-billion dollar nuclear power plant in China's eastern province of Jiangsu, which Russia has offered to finance with $2 billion worth of low-interest loans.</p>
<p>Sino-Russian ties have gradually warmed since 1989 when the two sides formally mended relations strained after the two communist giants struggled for leadership of the socialist world in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Both have said they want to see an improvement in economic ties to match gains on the political front.</p>
