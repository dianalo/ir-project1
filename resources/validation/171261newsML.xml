<p>Top Thai soothsayers predict that New Aspiration Party (NAP) leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's star will shine brightest during Thailand's November 17 general elections and that he will become the country's new premier.</p>
<p>Five prominent fortune tellers told a seminar late on Tuesday that the stars favoured Chavalit, the outgoing defence minister. Newspaper polls have showed his top rival, Democrat Party leader Chuan Leekpai, was very popular at the grassroots level.</p>
<p>The predictions of fortune tellers always carry weight among Thailand's 60 million people, who are predominantly Buddhist but who also subscribe heavily to superstitions and soothsaying.</p>
<p>&quot;The Sun is at an angle which will give the strongest power to Chavalit's Uranus star. It will make his star the brightest on election day,&quot; said the most popular of the five soothsayers, Attaviroj Sritula.</p>
<p>&quot;So I predict that Chavalit will be the next prime minister,&quot; he added as the others concurred.</p>
<p>&quot;Although Chuan's Mars star has enabled him to be the people's beloved, his star would be eclipsed by the Sun during this period and make his chances slim,&quot; Attaviroj said.</p>
<p>Another fortune teller, Pinyo Pongchareon, agreed with Attaviroj, but cautioned that the stars would realign after November 20 and things could change.</p>
<p>If the winner does not form a new government by that date, all predictions could be upset and Chuan could become the next premier, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I agree that the Sun is in a position that favours Chavalit's Uranus sign. But if he cannot form the coalition by November 20, when the Sun would have moved, the chance will go to Chuan,&quot; Pinyo said.</p>
<p>Soothsayer Bancha Lerthanoo told the seminar that Chavalit would become the next premier as the NAP would win 96 seats in parliament and Chuan's Democrats would win 95.</p>
<p>A total of 2,310 candidates from 13 parties are fighting for 393 seats in the lower house of parliament. Analysts say no party is strong enough to win an outright majority and the next government almost surely will be another coalition.</p>
<p>Bancha's prediction differed from recent newspaper and university polls, which project the NAP and the Democrats winning over 100 seats each.</p>
