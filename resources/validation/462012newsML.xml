<p>Cameroon will hold its postponed parliamentary election in May, according to a government statement.</p>
<p>The statement, issued after a cabinet meeting on Saturday, did not give any date. A source close to President Paul Biya's office said polling would be in the first half of May.</p>
<p>The election will be the second parliamentary poll since Cameroon's sometimes turbulent transition to multi-party democracy began in 1990.</p>
<p>Part of the opposition boycotted the last legislative election in 1992. Biya supporters secured a majority then after allying with a minor party.</p>
<p>The government postponed this year's election from March after opposition party complaints that their activists had not had enough time to register.</p>
<p>The government postponement order said the aim was to prevent tension and street clashes that had characterised previous elections.</p>
<p>A second reason for the postponement was to allow time to set up a constitutional council to proclaim results and vet any complaints from candidates.</p>
<p>The opposition has demanded an independent national electoral commission.</p>
<p>Biya, who took over from independence president Ahmadou Ahidjo in 1982, faces a presidential election in October.</p>
