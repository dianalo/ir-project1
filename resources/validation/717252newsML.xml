<text>
<p>An Iraqi newspaper published a picture on Wednesday showing President Saddam Hussein's eldest son Uday standing without crutches for the first time since he was released from a hospital last month.</p>
<p>In the picture, published by the newspaper Babel, he was standing and shaking hands with a Qatari delegation who congratulated him on his recovery.</p>
<p>Iraqi media had said last month that Uday left Ibn Sinaa Hospital in Baghdad after a &quot;full recovery&quot;.</p>
<p>Uday was reported to have been seriously wounded by unidentified gunmen as he was driving in Baghdad's wealthy district of al-Mansour last December.</p>
<p>He underwent several operations, the last in April on his left leg. Uday, who said he was hit in both legs, said after the last operation he expected to be on his feet in a few days or weeks.</p>
