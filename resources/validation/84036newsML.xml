<p>U.N. special envoy Norbert Holl said on Sunday the United Nations wanted to pursue dialogue with Afghanistan's Islamic Taleban movement which has declared a new government after capturing Kabul on Friday.</p>
<p>The following is a chronology of main events in Afghanistan since the end of the monarchy in 1973:</p>
<p>1973 - After more than two centuries of monarchy, King Zahir Shah ousted in a military takeover led by cousin Mohammad Daoud.</p>
<p>1978 - President Daoud killed in coup. Nur Mohammad Taraki elected president of revolutionary council. Islamic groups start armed protests against communist policies.</p>
<p>1979 - Hafizullah Amin appointed prime minister, becomes president after shootout in which Taraki is killed.</p>
<p>- December - Soviet transport planes land in Kabul, troops seize key buildings and radio station. Babrak Karmal becomes president, requests Soviet military aid. Amin executed.</p>
<p>1980 - U.N. General Assembly calls for immediate withdrawal of foreign troops. Afghan guerrilla groups in Pakistan form alliance and start receiving arms from Pakistan, United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, China and other backers.</p>
<p>1988, April - Pakistan, Afghanistan, the Soviet Union and the United States sign agreement in Geneva for withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Afghanistan by February 15, 1989.</p>
<p>1989, February - Last Soviet soldier leaves. Mujahideen consultative council, or shura, elects moderate Sibghatullah Mojadidi executive president and hardliner Abdurrab Rasul Sayyaf prime minister of a &quot;provisional government.&quot;</p>
<p>- March - Kabul says leftists arrested after planning coup. Mujahideen launch assault on Jalalabad, seeking a base for the rebel government, but the siege eventually fails.</p>
<p>1992, April - Rival guerrilla groups fight for control of Kabul. Mojadidi enters Kabul and takes over as new head of state. He is replaced within months by Burhanuddin Rabbani.</p>
<p>1993 - Inconclusive fighting between factions led by Ahmad Shah Masood, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Rabbani, leaving more than 10,000 civilians dead.</p>
<p>1994 - Factional battles continue between forces loyal to the president and Prime Minister Hekmatyar and his allies, reducing Kabul to rubble and forcing many of its residents to flee the city.</p>
<p>Aug - A senior mullah from the southern town of Kandahar, Mohammad Omar Akhund, sets up the Taleban, a group of Islamic religious students, who quickly emerge as a powerful guerrilla force.</p>
<p>1995 - Taleban continue their offensive, reaching gates of Kabul in February. They are ousted in March by troops loyal to President Burhanuddin Rabbani in militia's first major defeat.</p>
<p>In October they advance to gates of Kabul for second time, capturing Charasyab and later Rishkor and Khairabad hills.</p>
<p>1996:</p>
<p>April 3: About 1,000 Moslem clergymen choose Taleban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar as Amir-ul-Momineen (commander of the faithful), denouncing Rabbani as unfit to lead Islamic nation.</p>
<p>June 1: Government confirms loss of Chaghcharan, capital of the central province of Ghor, to Taleban.</p>
<p>June 26: Taleban launch deadly rocket attack on Kabul, killing at least 54 people and wounding 118, as Hekmatyar resumes post of prime minister under peace deal with Rabbani.</p>

<p>Sept 11: Taleban capture eastern city of Jalalabad and surrounding Nangarhar province adjoining Pakistan border.</p>

<p>Sept 22: Taleban say they capture Kunar, the last eastern province held by pro-government forces.</p>
<p>Sept 25: Taleban say they capture strategic town of Sarobi, 70 km (31 miles) east of Kabul, and thrust north towards Bagram military airbase, 50 km (31 miles) north of the capital.</p>
<p>Sept 26: Afghan government troops begin abandoning Kabul with forces of the rebel Taleban Islamic militia poised on the edge of the city.</p>
<p>Sept 27: Taleban takes control of Kabul, hanging former president Najibullah and his brother Shahpur Ahmadzai and declaring Afghanistan a &quot;completely Islamic state&quot; where a &quot;complete Islamic system will be enforced&quot;.</p>
<p>Pakistan becomes the first state to recognise the new regime, saying it will send officials to Kabul for talks.</p>
<p>The United States holds out the possibility of diplomatic ties with the new Taleban administration.</p>
<p>Sept 28: Taleban says it hanged two more members of Najibullah's government and is pursuing Rabbani and his advisers who have retreated north of Kabul.</p>
