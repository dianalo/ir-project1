<p>Pakistanis went to the polls with few signs of enthusiasm on Monday as former prime minister Nawaz Sharif predicted he would win a comfortable parliamentary majority.</p>
<p>A polling agent of the ethnic Mohajir National Movement (MQM) died after being kidnapped and tortured in Karachi, where at least five people were wounded overnight and on Monday.</p>
<p>President Farooq Leghari called national and provincial assembly elections, being held on the same day for the first time, after dismissing Benazir Bhutto as prime minister on disputed charges of corruption and misrule on November 5.</p>
<p>Sharif, who served as prime minister from 1990 to 1993 and is Bhutto's main rival, said he was confident of getting a majority in the National Assembly (lower house).</p>
<p>&quot;The country needs a strong and stable government,&quot; he told Reuters at his home in Lahore before casting his vote.</p>
<p>He promised not to seek revenge on Bhutto for alleged victimisation of his Pakistan Muslim League (PML) while she was in power and said he would not put her on trial.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not going to indulge in any politics of revenge,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be clean, good politics and we'll try to seek her cooperation to take the country forward.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the opposition and government should have a working relationship. &quot;So, what she did to us, we will not do to her.&quot;</p>
<p>Bhutto, who went to vote at 8:00 a.m. in a primary school in her village of Naudero, in Sindh province, was visibly surprised to find that she was the first to cast a ballot there.</p>
<p>&quot;People are voting for the arrow because they want stability, they want democracy,&quot; she said, referring to the election symbol of her Pakistan People's Party (PPP).</p>
<p>&quot;The PPP stands for economic reform,&quot; she said before visiting the graves of her father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and her brothers Murtaza and Shahnawaz in Garhi Khuda Bux village.</p>
<p>Few voters showed up when polling stations opened in fine weather at 7:00 a.m. (0200 GMT), an hour earlier than usual owing to the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>Ghinwa Bhutto, Lebanese-born widow of the slain Murtaza and now leader of the splinter PPP faction that he founded, was also the first person to vote in her Larkana constituency.</p>
<p>In Karachi, troops guarded polling stations and paramilitary rangers patrolled the streets.</p>
<p>The MQM said one of its polling agents, Mohammad Hanif, had been kidnapped and tortured by gunmen in the early hours. Hanif, brother of a provincial assembly candidate, died in hospital.</p>
<p>Ambulance workers said they picked up two wounded people from the city's Korangi area. At least three people were injured in overnight violence in the city's District Central.</p>
<p>Baba Ghori, a spokesman for the MQM's London-based leader Altaf Hussain, complained that voters were being intimidated by militants of the rival MQM-Haqiqi faction.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not happy with security arrangements,&quot; he said, adding that the MQM had appealed to the authorities to tighten security in tense areas, but had received no response.</p>
<p>The 36,415 polling stations, guarded by police and 250,000 troops on election duty, will stay open until 4:00 p.m. (1100 GMT), with results expected late in the evening.</p>
<p>The main fight pits the PML, fielding 177 National Assembly candidates, against the PPP, with 161. Ex-cricketer Imran Khan's Tehrik-i-Insaaf (Justice Movement) has put up 132 candidates, Ghinwa Bhutto's PPP-Shaheed Bhutto faction 66 and the MQM 55. Others are from smaller parties or are standing as independents.</p>
<p>Leghari promised in an address to the nation on Sunday night that the polls would be free, fair and open.</p>
<p>Bhutto rejected any notion she might agree to leave Pakistan to escape possible prosecution for corruption.</p>
<p>&quot;The question does not arise of my seeking asylum in Britain or anywhere else,&quot; she told Reuters at her farmhouse in Naudero.</p>
<p>She was responding to a report in London's Sunday Times, which quoted senior Pakistani government sources as saying that to avoid a sensitive trial, possible corruption charges against Bhutto and her jailed husband Asif Ali Zardari could be dropped if she agreed to leave the country and abandon politics.</p>
<p>&quot;Pakistan is my home and I am going to live in my home,&quot; said Bhutto, who denies any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled last week that there was enough evidence to justify Leghari's action in sacking Bhutto.</p>
<p>Zardari has been under detention since Bhutto's dismissal on November 5 and faces a charge of conspiring to kill Murtaza.</p>
