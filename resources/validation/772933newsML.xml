<p>The Treasury's refunding next week will  occupy the attention of debt market participants, as they continue  to sort out what this past week's full menu of economic data means  for the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The Treasury will sell $16 billion in three-year notes, $12.0 billion  in 10-year notes and $10.0 billion in 30-year bonds next Tuesday,  Wednesday and Thursday.  Market players said the refunding should  occupy more attention than next week's economic data which will include  the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, June chain store sales and June  consumer credit.  </p>
<p>After a barrage of surprisingly strong economic data sent 30-year  Treasury bonds plummeting more than two points Friday, &quot;The refunding  will be the central focus of next week,&quot; said Joseph Liro, chief economist  at CIBC Wood Gundy.</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt if the Beige Book will give any indication of a Fed move,&quot;  Liro said. &quot;The real focus is how the market handles the supply,&quot;</p>
<p>After Friday's back-up in rates, said Liro, &quot;It should be a lot easier  to take down these auctions than when it was with the 10-year note  below 6.0 percent which is where it was before the jobs number.&quot;   </p>
<p>The market was stunned by Friday's July jobs data that was much stronger  than expected;  the unemployment rate fell to 4.8 percent and 316,000  nonfarm jobs were created. Then the National Association of Purchasing  Management index of July manufacturing activity rose to 58.6 percent,  its highest in 2-1/2 years. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan  released its July final index of consumer sentiment, which soared  to an all-time high of 107.1 from 104.5 in the final June report.</p>
<p>Treasury prices, which rallied for for consecutive days through Thursday  fell sharply Friday amid repeated signs the nation's economy may be  stronger than the market had thought.  </p>
<p>&quot;The economy is showing some strengthening in the third quarter and  interest rates have shown significant declines. Some of the euphoria  is now coming out of the market,&quot; said Lynn Reaser, chief economist  at Barnett Bank Inc.</p>
<p>Prior to Friday's strong data, Reaser contended, next week's refunding  was &quot;largely discounted in the market.&quot;</p>
<p>She said June consumer credit data, to be released Thursday, Augusts  7, could provide clues to consumer confidence. Otherwise, Reaser said,  &quot;It should be a pretty slow week in terms of numbers. The market will  be adjusting to this week's numbers which showed some rebound in July.&quot;   </p>
<p>John Williams, managing director and chief global markets economist  at Bankers Trust Co, agreed that participants in the Treasury market  &quot;likely will digest the blizzard of data it got this week.</p>
<p>&quot;People are looking to see if there is any hint of a strong second  half in the nation's economy,&quot; said Williams, referring to the Fed's  beige book, to be released Wednesday, August 6..</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect that it will confirm there is a lot of economic momentum.  The market's euphoria has been built on a benign inflation backdrop,&quot;  he added.  </p>
<p>&quot;If the economy shows some strengthening we can move to 6.5 percent  to 7.0 percent, particuarly if the economy shows signs of strengthening  and talk of a (Federal Reserve) tightening later in the year crops  up,&quot; Reaser said.</p>
<p>Reaser said she believed signs of vigor hinted at by Friday's economic  data may reignite expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate  move later this year. &quot;Employment and the purchasing management index  all show the economy is far from dead,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Williams noted that Treasury prices gave &quot;quite a concession&quot; Friady  and &quot;the refunding next week will go OK at these levels.&quot;</p>
<p>Liro predicted next week's refunding should pick up momentum as the  week progresses. So, while three-year notes may not see as lively  investor interest, the 30-year bonds should be well received, he said.</p>
