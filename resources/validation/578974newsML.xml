<title>MEXICO: Mexico Cetes rate edges down on U.S. data.</title>
<headline>Mexico Cetes rate edges down on U.S. data.</headline>

<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates were down five basis points in early trade on Tuesday at 19.20 percent on light buying prompted by stability in the U.S. long bond in response to U.S. retail sales data.</p>
<p>&quot;The (U.S. retail) data were very good, below expectations and are thus spurring a little buying,&quot; a fixed-income analyst said.</p>
<p>U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds were meanwhile down 5/32 to yield 6.90 percent in early trade.  </p>
<p>Traders said rates may nonetheless come under upside pressure with demand for liquidity from banks which have until Wednesday to settle balances outstanding on checking accounts they hold with the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The cut-off date is coming up and some banks may have accrued overdrafts, so those with cash will want to take advantage and try to push rates up,&quot; another analyst said. Dealers said developments during the session would also largely depend on forecast results for the central bank's weekly auction of government securities later in the day.  </p>
<p>&quot;We still expect rates (on Cetes) to go up, maybe by a little less due to the U.S. (retail sales) data, but we should see an increase nonetheless,&quot; the analyst added.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper mirrored government rates, and were down 10 basis points to 20.50 percent.</p>
<p>Liquidity of 179 million pesos was due to return to the system from prior central bank operations.</p>
