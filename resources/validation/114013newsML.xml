<p>The State Duma lower house of parliament will ask the government to submit a new draft 1997 budget within 10 days and then send it to a conciliation commission of deputies and government officials, Mikhail Zadornovthe, head of the Duma's budget committee, said on Monday.</p>
<p>The compromise proposal was drafted by a commission set up on Friday to make a recommendation on the fate of the budget, he told reporters.</p>
<p>Deputies on Friday rejected the budget by 280 votes to 33, but left until next Wednesday a decision on whether to reject it outright and ask the government for a new draft, or to send it to a conciliation commission.</p>
<p>Normally the government would have 20 days to prepare a new draft if it is completely rejected.</p>
<p>Deputies have complained that the government's revenue projections were unrealistic, given this year's serious tax shortfall, while some opposition parties said the budget would not do enough to revive the economy.</p>
<p>The draft rejected on Friday proposed 1997 spending of 524.34 trillion roubles, revenues of 433.64 trillion and a deficit of 90.70 trillion or 3.3 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>Duma deputy speaker Alexander Shokhin said some parties would insist on increasing expenditure.</p>
<p>But because the government is keen to keep the deficit low, because of Russia's $10 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund, that would entail a corresponding increase in revenue.</p>
<p>Tax revenues in September were only 9.6 trillion roubles, or 43 percent less than in August, Prime-Tass news agency said, quoting the State Tax Service.</p>
<p>The government is taking steps to increase tax collection and hopes to receive a further 400-420 trillion roubles in taxes by the end of the year, about the planned tax volumes, Prime-Tass said.</p>
<p>On Friday President Boris Yeltsin set up a special commission to improve tax collection headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyurdin with wide punitive powers.</p>
