<p>Shareholders of Russian oil producer Purneftegaz, the prize in a long battle between two major oil companies, will meet in Siberia on Friday to hear how the present victor plans to partially absorb its catch.</p>
<p>State oil company Rosneft, which the government plans to privatise later this year and which holds 51 percent of Purneftegaz voting stock, will outline plans to create a single share, a Rosneft spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Rosneft must be privatised and issue shares first, then we will look into uniting the shares (with Purneftegaz). It is a long process,&quot; said spokesman Vladimir Tumarkin. He said other Russian holding companies took years to carry out such plans.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Purneft workers were ignoring attempts by Rosneft competitor SIDANKO to take over the company in court, though share analysts differed on whether investors would trust Purneft until the issue had been finally resolved.</p>
<p>SIDANKO oil holding company, which briefly held Purneftegaz in 1994 before it was given to Rosneft, is seeking its return in court, though it has lost a number of cases.</p>
<p>The Moscow Arbitration Court ruled against SIDANKO on April 14, though SIDANKO said it would appeal.</p>
<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell oil analyst Steve Allen said it was doubtful that Rosneft would lose the court battle.</p>
<p>He said a new chief executive with experience heading a production company would probably take output improvement seriously and that Rosneft finally appeared comfortable that they would keep Purneftegaz.</p>
<p>&quot;Purneftegaz is very much oriented now toward boosting its production. A company always says that, but this new general manager is somebody from the oil side who has seen levels decrease and is bothered by that.&quot;</p>
<p>Purneftegaz produced 169,600 barrels per day last year, almost unchanged on 1995 production of 166,200 bpd. This is about 2.7 percent of Russian oil production.</p>
<p>Rinaco-Plus oil analyst Oksana Shishkova said the SIDANKO battle would likely be drawn out.</p>
<p>&quot;Since there are large oil reserves, it is clear why the judicial process has not finished. I think it will last a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>Salomon Brothers estimated that Purneftegaz has oil reserves of 800.6 million tonnes (5.6 billion barrels). It said Russia's total reserves were 49 billion barrels.</p>
<p>The Rosneft spokesman said that Purneft had dropped plans to issue American Depositary Receipts, share look-alikes which allow trading on foreign markets, as part of the long-term share consolidation process.</p>
<p>&quot;Today it (the ADR plan) is not viable because they are looking at a single share with Rosneft,&quot; he said.</p>
