<p>Chinese Australians in the northern state of Queensland asked authorities on Monday to block a new political party formed by local race row MP Pauline Hanson because it would violate anti-racism laws.</p>
<p>The Queensland Chinese Community Voice, representing about 30,000 Chinese Australians lodged an objection to the party's registration with the Australian Electoral Commission, the community's legal advisor Lawrence Ma said.</p>
<p>Hanson, who created an international storm last year with her attacks on Asian immigration and Aboriginal welfare, announced last month she was forming her own &quot;One Nation&quot; party and aimed to become a major force in politics.</p>
<p>Ma said his association had lodged an objection to Hanson's party on the grounds its existence contravened Australian laws against racial discrimination and racial hatred.</p>
<p>&quot;Racism will not die in Australia unless we fight it,&quot; Ma told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Our legal advice is that if the commission's decision is unfavourable to us, then we could take our objections to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Ma said blocking registration of Hanson's party &quot;would stop most of the problems, but of course they could register the party under another name elsewhere&quot;.</p>
