<p>Nearly three million Norwich Union members received windfalls averaging nearly 1,400 pounds ($2,280) on Monday as the insurance company made its debut on the London stock market.</p>
<p>A clamour for shares among investment institutions after a heavily oversubscribed public offering drove the stock well above the flotation strike price for Norwich Union Plc set on Sunday at 290 pence per share, although the shares ended well below the day's high.</p>
<p>The flotation, the first by a mutually owned British insurer, valued the group at around six and a half billion pounds, making it Britain's third largest quoted insurance group behind Prudential Corp and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance.</p>
<p>Within minutes of the start of trading the price had jumped to 356 pence.</p>
<p>While that turned out to be the day's best price, the shares still ended 35-1/2 pence higher at 325-1/2 pence, providing a healthy first day profit for shareholders.</p>
<p>With nearly 150 million shares changing hands, the shares were easily the most actively traded in the market.</p>
<p>Wilder predictions that the price might squeeze as high as four pounds proved unfounded though analysts expect the shares to remain volatile over the coming week.</p>
<p>Speculation that the government may remove tax advantages for pension funds owning equities helped take the early froth out of the shares as the whole market retreated on the tax concerns.</p>
<p>Analysts have put then 'fair value' of the stock at between 280 pence and 340 pence.</p>
<p>One suggested valuations would not look excessively stretched at 380 pence, though others were more cautious.</p>
<p>&quot;I've long thought the predicted prices of 340 and 350 pence were very high and not sustainable for long,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>&quot;The offer pricing took place against a very strong stock market and very strong insurance sector share prices. The market could take the 290 pence price but it wasn't a giveaway.&quot;</p>
<p>The gains meant the minimum 300 shares received by 1.8 million with-profits members were worth just under 1,000 pounds. Many received far more depending on the size and duration of their policies.</p>
<p>Around 1.1 million non-profit policyholders received a flat rate 150 shares worth nearly 500 pounds.</p>
<p>Norwich Union policyholders shared a handout of 1.3 billion free shares as well as the chance to subscribe for more shares at a 25 pence discount to the public offer.</p>
<p>Members applied for nearly four times as many shares as were available while institutions subscribed for a mammoth 10 times the number allocated for them.</p>
<p>Applications were severely scaled back with only those members applying for up to 1,500 pounds worth of shares getting their full allotment.</p>
<p>As with recent demutualising building societies Halifax and Alliance &amp; Leicester, unsatisfied demand among investment institutions, some of whom missed out altogether, was a big factor in the early rise in the stock price.</p>
<p>Like Halifax, Norwich Union is certain to enter the FTSE 100 index of Britain's largest companies later this year, heightening demand among institutions keen to maintain the weighting of the financial sector in their portfolios.</p>
<p>Many of those lucky enough to get shares will have been tempted to cash in immediately especially members borrowing to fund the purchase of extra shares.</p>
<p>With the discount, instant profits amounted to 60-1/2 pence per share, or 342 pounds for someone successfully applying for 1,500 pounds worth of shares.</p>
<p>Share prices of both the building societies which floated recently peaked on the first day.</p>
<p>However, with Norwich Union not entering the FTSE 100 until late September, institutions which currently hold just over 20 percent of the company may feel less immediate need to chase stock to make up the shortfalls in their allocations. ($ = 0.612 British Pounds)</p>
