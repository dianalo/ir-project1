<p>International sweetener group Tate &amp; Lyle Plc said on Wednesday structural problems in the U.S. fructose business, which hit Tate's first-half profits, could be past their worst, but the position would remain unclear until contracts were negotiated towards the year end.</p>
<p>Chief executive Larry Pillard said it seemed as though the fructose market could be bottoming out based on overall capacity utilisation.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the capacity utilisation we see would tend to make you believe we're on the upswing of the cycle,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>But, he added, the picture would not be clear until contract negotiations began late in the year.</p>
<p>Unsustainably high capacity utilisation in 1994/95 led to quite high margins which drew a lot of capital investment into the fructose part of the business, he said.</p>
<p>Pillard said Tate was encouraged by its A.E. Staley unit's performance relative to competitors and also by the strength of underlying market growth of four to five percent a year.</p>
<p>High fructose corn syrup, produced by Staley, is used as a sweetener in soft drinks like Coca Cola and Pepsi.  </p>
<p>Pillard, who took over as chief executive in November last year, has undertaken a major review of the group, which has included asset write-downs of certain underperforming businesses.</p>
<p>In North America this produced an exceptional charge of 29.9 million. The group expects payback over two years, he said.</p>
<p>The chief executive said there had also been strong cost initiatives in other parts of the group and management had been refocused on improving returns for investors.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we're refocused as management on performance and we're working very diligently to make sure that we assure shareholder returns.&quot;</p>
<p>Cost cutting had benefited the group's North American sugar business and Pillard said the group was optimistic that good underlying growth and supply, plus cost cuts would sustain its strong performance.</p>
<p>In Europe, overcapacity in potato starch was pressurising some of the starch markets and there was tough competition in other sweetener products, Pillard said.</p>
<p>But he said the biggest factor for its European unit Amylum had been start up costs associated with its reorganisation of its production in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;The main thrusts of those starts ups will continue through this calendar year,&quot; he said, predicting that the group should see returns from the investment flowing through in the last half of 1998.</p>
<p>Tate reported first half profits before tax and exceptional charges of 113.6 million stg, down from 168.2 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Tate's shares were four pence lower at 450 pence by 1003 GMT.</p>
