<p>Copper prices were just easier in late London inter-office activity after ending a touch lower at the LME kerb.</p>
<p>By the time Comex closed at 1900 GMT three-months LME copper was bid at $2,240 compared with a kerb close at $2,244 a tonne, a $3 loss from Monday's kerb.</p>
<p>The market is expected to remain hamstrung between $2,230 and $2,280 overhead, traders said.</p>
<p>The focus during Tuesday had been on the wide nearby spreads as the market continued to work through fierce prompt tightness, the traders added. Spot premiums, as well as the overall spread structure, remain firm, and this trend will be maintained in the run-up towards next week's February option declarations and third Wednesday pricing two weeks after that, they said. Cash/one day traded at a premium of $24, just $2 under the permissible daily limit, as major shorts between now and next week are squeezed.</p>
