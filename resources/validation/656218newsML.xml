<title>BRAZIL: Disqualified Brazil B Band bidders file appeals.</title>
<headline>Disqualified Brazil B Band bidders file appeals.</headline>
<dateline>SAO PAULO 1997-06-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Five consortia disqualified last week from bidding on Brazil's B Band cellular concessions filed appeals on Wednesday in hopes of getting back in the running for the privatization, an official said.</p>
<p>Communications Ministry spokesman Francisco Mendonca said some of the 10 qualifying groups also filed administrative appeals with the ministry committee overseeing the selloff to try to bump off competition.</p>
<p>&quot;Of the 26 appeals, five were from the disqualified groups. The rest were from qualified groups against other consortia to try to disqualify them,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The panel last week ruled ineligible five of 15 consortia that presented bids in early April for nine of the 10 concessions offered by the government. The disqualified groups are Tess, Lightel, Algar, Mcom Wireless and Hutchinson-Cowan.</p>
<p>Lightel comprises Brazil's private telecoms operator Lightel and construction firm Queirroz Galvao, as well as South Korea's Mobile Telecom.</p>
<p>Algar is a separate consortium with the same composition as the Lightel consortium that is bidding on a separate area.  </p>
<p>Hutchison/Cowan is made up of telecommunications group Hutchinson Whampoa and Brazilian construction company Cowan Construtora.</p>
<p>Tess comprises Swedish telecom operator Telia, Brazil's Airline Cellular, and Primave, a unit of Brazilian construction group C.R. Alameida.</p>
<p>MCOM Wireless is made up of the investment wing of Banco Garantia, Garantia Participacoes, Telmex, and  U.S.-based Comcast.  </p>
<p>Mendonca said the committee now has five days to decide if it will reverse any decisions based on the appeals or pass the appeals on to Communications Minister Sergio Motta.</p>
<p>The appeals must be cleared before further B Band concessions can be granted, a process that could take weeks, he said.</p>
<p>President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Tuesday formally granted the first of the concessions, B Band area 7 covering central and western Brazil, to a Canadian-led group which cast the lone bid.  </p>
<p>Americel S.A. bid of 338.5 million reais, 25.4 percent above the base price, for the license to operate cellular services in the area, which includes Brasilia.</p>
<p>The consortium is led by BCE Inc unit Bell Canada and Telesystem, and also includes Citibank, local Opportunity bank, and pension funds owned by Banco do Brasil.</p>
