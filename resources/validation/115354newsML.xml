<title>UK: INSTANT VIEW - UK September PPI data.</title>
<headline>INSTANT VIEW - UK September PPI data.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Following is a selection of economists' reactions to UK PPI data showing September input prices up s/a 0.3% m/m and down 2.9% y/y and output prices up 0.4% m/m and up 2.2% y/y:</p>
<p>The Reuters consensus forecast was input prices +0.5% m/m and -2.4% y/y and output prices +0.1% m/m and +1.8% y/y.</p>
<p>STEPHEN HANNAH, IBJ INTERNATIONAL (RFTV)</p>
<p>&quot;It's a little bit disappointing on the headline figure, although if you strip out food, drink, tobacco and petroleum products it looks a much more modest increase.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;The food and energy components have been rather buoyant recently. Typically the authorities don't worry about these sorts of developments because they tend to be a far more volatile element of the series and don't really impact on near-term policy. My judgment initially from these figures is that they're not sufficiently different from expectations to trouble the markets. I don't think they will strengthen the case dramatically for any early interest rate moves in either direction.&quot;  </p>
<p>KEVIN GARDINER, MORGAN STANLEY</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't take too seriously the headline increase in the output index as it was distorted by petrol prices. Producer price data are old news in a way. Looking forward, it doesn't add anything to the inflation debate...and the figures have virtually no relevance to monetary policy.&quot;  </p>
<p>JEREMY HAWKINS, BANK OF AMERICA</p>
<p>&quot;The PPI data were mixed and should have minimal impact on trading. The key core rate of PPI showed a further fall to 0.9% year/year vs 1.2%. This is the lowest rate since September 1967 and suggests that underlying inflationary pressures are very subdued. Some of the positive impact from this number will be offset by the headline rate which showed an increase of 2.2% y/y. However, this came as a result of the larger than anticipated impact from oil and petroleum prices. PPI input came out broadly as expected. Contraction of 2.9% y/y...implies very little inflationary pressure from commodity prices.&quot;</p>
