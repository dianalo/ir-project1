<p>Hungary on Tuesday said it welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's election victory and looked forward to a continued strong U.S. presence in Eastern Europe as the region prepares for NATO enlargement.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to the U.S. role continuing internationally in terms of maintaining democratic values, helping solve local crises and determined support for the enlargement of NATO,&quot; foreign ministry spokesman Gabor Szentivanyi told Reuters.</p>
<p>Hungary plays host to thousands of U.S. troops at the U.S. Army's forward base for its IFOR peace implementation force for Bosnia at Taszar in southern Hungary and was a close adviser to Clinton during the lead-up to the Dayton conference on the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Szentivanyi said the U.S.'s part in sponsoring the Dayton peace agreement ending the four-year war in the neighbouring former Yugoslavia had been invaluable.</p>
<p>&quot;It shows there is a need for a U.S. involvement and it's very well reflected by the postiton of other European powers.&quot;</p>
<p>Szentivanyi said he saw Clinton as a strong supporter of Hungary's efforts to join NATO.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome the very determined position of this Administration and Congressional support for the enlargement of NATO and also our efforts to join the European Union.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that Hungary was comfortable with the new U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>&quot;We enjoy bipartisan support from within Congress so we have no problem with the composition,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Congress is the only Western legislature which has specifically named Hungary, along with Poland and the Czech Republic, as the first countries which should be allowed to join the Alliance.</p>
<p>Szentivanyi added that Hungarian relations with the Clinton Administration were more than just cordial.</p>
<p>&quot;We have such close cooperation over Dayton and NATO enlargement I can see a strategic alliance developing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hungarian newspapers concentrated on the low turnout and Clinton's ability to adapt to cirumstances as the the most noteworthy features of the election.</p>
<p>&quot;The key to Clinton's success, despite Dole's best efforts, lies in his personality,&quot; said the daily Magyar Nemzet. &quot;After the first two years of failed liberal politics he was able to take on conservative policies and that's what got him re-elected &quot;</p>
<p>The centrist Magyar Hirlap believed neither candidate had inspired people to go out and vote in large numbers.</p>
<p>&quot;The lack of interest was a dominating feature of this election,&quot; it said.</p>
