<p>Germany's central bank campaigned hard for a stable, credible European currency on Thursday, drumming home the message that no country can be allowed to bluff its way through the EMU entry test.</p>
<p>At a news conference called to present the Bundesbank's 1996 balance sheet, its president Hans Tietmeyer stressed that those countries which adopted the euro in 1999 must show sustainable convergence under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;We consider all the criteria important,&quot; Tietmeyer said. &quot;Inflation, interest rates, exchange rates and the condition of public finances...What is important is that the situation should be sustainable,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Making clear that both Bonn and the central bank agreed that the criteria for entry to EMU must not be softened, Tietmeyer neatly dodged the question of what should happen if countries nonetheless failed to make the grade.</p>
<p>&quot;The Treaty is the Treaty and in the Treaty there are dates. If the dates are not adhered to then this is an issue for politicians,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Germany, in common with other countries, is having serious problems in reducing its budget deficit to the reference level of three percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>It has already sought the sanction of EU finance ministers for its public debt position, which exceeds a target level of 60 percent of GDP, arguing the costs of German unification.</p>
<p>The central bank itself gave a small boost to Bonn's coffers on Thursday, revealing an annual profit of 9.43 billion marks ($5.5 billion), 8.83 billion of which will be transferred to Bonn.</p>
<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel has budgeted for seven billion marks this year and the remainder will be used to retire old debt.</p>
<p>But the Bundesbank, as expected, gave no helping hand to sluggish economic growth at its regular policy meeting, leaving its main interest rates unchanged at record low levels.</p>
<p>The discount and Lombard rates -- the floor and ceiling for money market rates -- have been steady at 2.50 percent and 4.50 percent respectively since they were last eased in April 1996.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer held out little prospect of any change. &quot;I see neither rate rises nor rate cuts in the foreseeable future.&quot;</p>
<p>Noting that the export-driven recovery had so far failed to translate into greater investment activity, he said this was not the fault of monetary policy but rather a result of general uncertainty about planned economic reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;We need decisions soon,&quot; he said, referring to Bonn's plans to overhaul taxation and pension plans.</p>
<p>Chief economist Otmar Issing, asked after the news conferencce about Germany's efforts to rein in its budget spending to qualify for European monetary union, said that the year so far had started badly.</p>
<p>&quot;But the year can't be written off yet,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Maastricht Treaty gives a reference level of three percent of gross domestic product as the normal maximum deficit permitted, while the limit for total debt is 60 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Germany, which had a deficit of 3.8 percent last year, and 3.5 percent in 1995, is aiming for 2.9 percent this year.</p>
<p>Yet Tietmeyer argued vehemently against the idea that some countries could enter EMU on the strength of a last-minute dash to cut their budget deficits to the magic three percent level in 1997 alone, calling for a longer term evaluation.</p>
<p>&quot;In our assessment of the public finances we have to look at the development in recent years, look at the current situation, and then look at the future,&quot; Tietmeyer said.</p>
<p>He declined to comment more directly on attempts by some countries to improve their 1997 balance sheets, such as Italy's one-off euro tax, but said that Germany had so far refrained from any &quot;creative accounting&quot;.</p>
