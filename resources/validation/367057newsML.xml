<title>USA: US transatlantic crudes dry up on closed arbitrage.</title>
<headline>US transatlantic crudes dry up on closed arbitrage.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>North Sea and West African crudes on the U.S. Gulf Coast dried up on Monday, reflecting the closed transatlantic arbitrage, traders said.</p>
<p>The spread between benchmarks West Texas Intermediate/Cushing and North Sea Brent for March was around $1.30-35 Monday afternoon, after touching as low as $1.05-15 around midday.</p>
<p>The arbitrage was still considered open by a few refiners last week, but dwindling U.S. demand has finally shut the window.</p>
<p>&quot;The arb is closed because the United States doesn't need the crude,&quot; said one refiner, citing a prevalence of turnarounds on the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>U.S. refiners have been plagued by thin margins in recent months, further dampening crude demand, traders said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Latin America has unleashed a flood of short-haul barrels onto the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>&quot;The Venezuelans had the mother of all fire sales last week,&quot; said one U.S. refiner, citing a pre-Lenten barrage of aggressively priced light and heavy Venezuelan grades.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Colombia's state-owned Ecopetrol sold two cargoes of sweet Cusiana crude for loading March 8-13 and March 17-21 to a U.S. refiner, traders said.</p>
<p>The former was sold at April WTI/Cushing minus 34 cents a barrel, while the latter fetched a discount of 28 cents a barrel, they said.</p>
