<title>SPAIN: Peseta debt/interbank market closing report.</title>
<headline>Peseta debt/interbank market closing report.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-03-18</dateline>

<p>The Spanish debt market ended sharply lower on Tuesday, adding fresh losses to Monday's fall amid new EMU blues. The peseta was still weak despite a third straight session of central bank intervention, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The underlying tone is dark, but still we could see the market taking a rest in the coming days,&quot; said Gregorio Gomez, economist at All Trading in Madrid.</p>
<p>Earlier, Spain's central bank was seen buying pesetas for marks at around 85. It was the third straight day the Bank of Spain intervened to prop up the currency.</p>
<p>The peseta ended a touch stronger at around 84.93/96.  </p>
<p>On Wednesday, the market should focus on U.S. February CPI, expected to give some hints on a possible Federal Reserve rate hike at the March 25 FOMC, dealers in Madrid said.</p>
<p>Spain's yield curve ended little changed, as two- and three-year bonds were also dragged down.</p>
<p>&quot;We had the three-year bond yields back above the six percent threshold,&quot; said Valentin Fernandez, economist at Credit Lyonnais in Madrid. The 9.4 percent April 1999 was trading at around 6.06 percent. He added that after an afternoon's selloff it is possible one-year bill yields could go up at an auction on Wednesday.</p>
