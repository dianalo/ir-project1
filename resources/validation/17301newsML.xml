<p>NYMEX crude prices may bounce higher early Tuesday after holding trendline support in Monday's selloff, but technical analysts warned that the bulls may head for the exits if the recent declines start to gain momentum.</p>
<p>Sept heating oil violated its uptrend channel on Monday, when the IPE was closed for a U.K. bank holiday, but was able to settle back above the support line, a constructive sign.</p>
<p>Sept gasoline remains the weakest component after ending below its uptrend channel and under previous support, they said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday we pulled back to $21.40 and that's a 38 percent retracement off the move of the July 29 low and we did bounce from that level,&quot; said one technical analyst in Chicago. &quot;But daily momentum (indicators) are a little overburdened so I think we'll continue to set back.&quot;</p>
<p>The daily stochastics on Friday posted a &quot;bear cross&quot; when the two indicators crossed and turned lower, she said, suggesting downside momentum and weakness in prices.</p>
<p>She put support at the July peak of $21.14 a barrel and then at $20.70, a Fibonacci 62 percent retracement from the July 29 low of $19.56 to the August 19 high of $22.55.  </p>
<p>She pegged resistance at $21.85-$21.90.</p>
<p>The contract closed Monday at $21.62 and last traded on ACCESS at $21.68. Some chartists said the trendline crossed Monday right near its day low of $21.40 and today at $21.50.</p>
<p>&quot;One problem with this market is there have been so many bear traps,&quot; the analyst warned. &quot;Right now I think there are some signals that the correction will be longer lasting and test some key support and test the resolve of the long-term bulls.&quot;  </p>
<p>Not including ACCESS, Oct crude formed a near-term double bottom at $21.40-$21.42 but on the spot continuation chart prices settled Monday below the 10- and 20-day moving averages, at $22.28 and $21.75 respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;For the last two weeks whenever we've had two days of selling, the third day has been followed by buying activity,&quot; said Dan Gramza, president of Gramza Capital Management in Evanston, Illinois.</p>
<p>&quot;That means if the rhythm holds true, then today would be an up day,&quot; he said. &quot;If it holds at these lows and the first hour is bullish, then I would look to buy.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;But what would be important is to get above $22 quickly in today's session and close above $22.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The crucial question is whether or not sideways movement and time will correct some of WTI's short term indicators or if price action must do the job instead,&quot; brokers at GNI Ltd said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;Ten-day momentum is back below zero but there is probably more work to be done before prices can clearly resume the uptrend again,&quot; they said, putting support at $21.30 and $21-$21.08.</p>
<p>For Sept gasoline, Gramza put immediate resistance at 61.70 cents a gallon, which was a low from August 16 that was broken on Monday, and then at 63 cents. He said gasoline's ability to break below 61.70 on Monday but settle more than one cent above its session low of 60.50 was a bullish sign.</p>
<p>&quot;The real key for today will be if the buying activity that came in late yesterday can give us follow through today and that would mean a close above 63 cents in September,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Brokers at MeesPierson also said late buying in September heating oil makes the bearish stance more cautious. The contract fell to 60.30 cents but settled at 61.03 cents, back into the uptrend channel dating back to the low of 55 cents on July 30.</p>
<p>&quot;The range has proved to hold once before so we look to see if 60.60 can continue to hold as support, if not we would need good volume building below this level to believe the break,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>They put resistance at 61.20, 61.50 and 62.10 and support below 60.60 at 60.20.</p>
