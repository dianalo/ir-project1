<p>Istanbul shares jumped an average 3.93 percent despite profit-taking on Monday as the market brushed aside political worries, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100closed up 61 points, or 3.93 percent at 1,613, but down from a morning high of 1,620. Trade volume rose to 26.06 trillion lira ($204.2 million) from 21 83 trillion ($172 million) on Friday.</p>
<p>The market had sank 6.2 percent last week amid fears of a rift in the Islamist-led coalition following the secularist military's demand to fight rising Islamist zeal.</p>
<p>Brokers said hopes that today's National Security Council (MGK) meeting would not cover sensitive issues fuelled purchases despite some afternoon selling.</p>
<p>In line with previous expectations, none of the disputed issues came up at the military-dominated MGK's meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;The market targets 1,650 levels after establishing a firm base at between 1,600-1,625 with strong volume,&quot; said Cem Baycan from Delta securities.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market would watch results of an IMF team visit to Turkey this week for an annual review of the economy and March inflation data due to be released on April 4, besides the political developments.</p>
