<p>Zairean and Rwandan soldiers traded artillery fire across their border on Wednesday, fuelling fears of a widening Central African conflict that has already forced half a million refugees to flee camps.</p>
<p>Zaire warned Rwanda it would fight to defend its territory and its vast mineral wealth against its small eastern neighbour.</p>
<p>Rwanda's military strongman riposted by threatening to retaliate against the Zairean shelling which he said had killed many people in the Rwandan border town of Cyangugu.</p>
<p>For the first time since ethnic warfare erupted in eastern Zaire two weeks ago, Zairean and Rwandan soldiers on Tuesday exchanged sustained mortar and machinegun fire across the river that divides the Zairean town of Bukavu from the Cyangugu area.</p>
<p>Aid workers reported more firing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a heavy exchange of artillery fire that lasted about two hours this morning. It is quiet right now,&quot; said Brenda Barton of the World Food Programme in Nairobi.</p>
<p>Barton, after speaking to contacts in Cyangugu, said a hotel had been hit by a mortar bomb. She had no word of casualties.</p>
<p>&quot;If Zaire brings the war to us we shall fight Zaire,&quot; Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame told a news conference in the Rwandan capital Kigali.</p>
<p>&quot;That is not a big problem for me. We are ready to fight even though we seek no war with Zaire,&quot; said Kagame, who is also defence minister and led Tutsi rebels to power in 1994.</p>
<p>Asked if he would take direct military action against Zaire, Kagame replied: &quot;There is no question about that. I still have to think about it (how to do it) but if you slap me in the face I have to respond.&quot;</p>
<p>Zaire has accused the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan army of supporting ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels fighting the Zairean army in eastern Zaire. Rwanda denies the accusation.</p>
<p>Zairean Foreign Minister Kitidwa Tumansi appeared on state television after Tuesday's fighting to repeat Zaire's charges against Rwanda of territorial ambition.</p>
<p>&quot;Zaire warns those who think the time has come to carve out new political and economic entities with hegemonic designs on its precious and strategic materials,&quot; Kitidwa said.</p>
<p>Fighting between Zairean troops and Tutsi rebels known as Banyamulenge has created the most serious refugee crisis in Africa since apocalyptic massacres and civil war in Rwanda in 1994 sent two million people fleeing into nearby states.</p>
<p>Most of the latest refugees on the move are Rwandan Hutus. Thousands are former soldiers and militiamen who took part in the 1994 massacre of up to a million minority Tutsis and their sympathisers in Rwanda before Kagame's rebels drove them out.</p>
<p>&quot;The worrying part about these 500,000 refugees is that there really is no assistance. We don't even know whether they have access to water,&quot; said U.N. refugee agency spokesman Panos Moumtzis from the Zairean town of Goma.</p>
<p>Even refugees still in camps are receiving minimal food aid because the U.N. is afraid that supplies will soon run out.</p>
<p>&quot;The roads are blocked, nothing is coming in. We are really very anxious,&quot; said Moumtzis.</p>
<p>&quot;Warehouses are very low in terms of food. Our understanding is that there is enough food for eight days...Right now what we ang out is the absolute minimum to sustain life.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.N. is trying to avoid a repeat of 1994, when thousands died daily of cholera and dysentery in eastern Zaire camps.</p>
<p>At Mugunga camp, near the east Zaire city of Goma, 400,000 refugees have crowded into the world's biggest, most densely packed camp and the priority is to avert epidemics.</p>
<p>&quot;Seventy-four teams with 10 men in each dug a total of 400 latrines there yesterday. Of course, that is nothing. We need a lot more,&quot; said Moumtzis.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is amazing that that they managed to do so much in one day because the land is volcanic rock.&quot;</p>
<p>He said children under five had been given high-protein biscuits at Mugunga on Tuesday. Workers found 26 severely malnourished children, who were now being treated.</p>
<p>The Tutsi rebels, whose ancestors settled in what is now eastern Zaire some 200 years ago, say they are fighting against ethnic discrimination and violence. They have taken the town of Uvira and threaten to overrun the South Kivu provincial capital of Bukavu.</p>
<p>Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, who is being treated for cancer in Switzerland, has sought to reassert his authority in his eastern borderlands by placing the two Kivu provinces under military rule.</p>
