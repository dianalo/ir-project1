<headline>S&amp;P official calls White House's DC plan &quot;bold&quot;.</headline>

<p>Bond rating agencies lauded the $3.9 billion federal aid plan announced by the White House on Tuesday for the District of Columbua and said they are eager to see if it survives city and congressional scrutiny.</p>
<p>&quot;It's encouraging that the administration has put forward such bold changes for the District,&quot; Parry Young, director of public finance at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp, said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>If Congress clears the plan, the city's current junk bond rating &quot;could go up,&quot; Young said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a pretty reasonable approach,&quot; Barbara Flickinger, assistant director and vice president of public finance at Moody's Investors Service, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously, it needs to be embraced by the city council, D.C. financial control board, and Congress,&quot; she said. &quot;(But) if these elements were to be enacted, it does bode well for the credit outlook&quot; for the city, she said.</p>
<p>Flickinger said the plan would do two important things. It would address &quot;structural problems,&quot; like the multi-billion-dollar unfunded pension liability, that the city inherited from the U.S. government in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The plan also recognizes that the D.C. economy needs revitalizing over the long, so that city revenues will continue to grow even when D.C.'s control board is dissolved, she said.</p>
<p>D.C. Mayor Marion Barry said, &quot;This will enhance our ability to go to the bond market in 1998 to borrow money&quot; for long term financings like road and bridge repairs.</p>
<p>&quot;Two of the greatest impediments to us having a higher bond rating were the unfunded pension liability and the unpredictable federal payment,&quot; he said, referring to a $660 million payment Congress makes annually to the city for the federal government's use of D.C. property.</p>
<p>The President said Congress should assume responsibility for the pension problem and other state-like functions currently handled by D.C. At the same time, Congress should wipe out the $660 million annual payment, the President said.</p>
<p>Under the White House plan, the federal and District governments and the city's control board must hammer out a memorandum of understanding before the plan can be sent to Capitol Hill for review.</p>
