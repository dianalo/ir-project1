<p>Defence lawyers in the Oklahoma City bombing trial girded on Wednesday for the tough task of knocking down a powerful prosecution case tying defendant Timothy McVeigh to the deadly blast.</p>
<p>Chief defence lawyer Stephen Jones was due to present his first witness on Thursday, one day after the prosecution finished arguing that McVeigh was responsible for the worst attack on civilians ever to occur on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>&quot;Jones has to take the prosecution's picture and turn it upside down,&quot; said Robert Precht, director of the Office of Public Service at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>Government witnesses testified about McVeigh's anger over the deaths of 80 Branch Davidian cult members in a clash with federal agents at Waco, Texas -- which the prosecution argued was his motive for bombing the Alfred P. Murrah federal building on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people.</p>
<p>Prosecution witnesses also tied the 29-year-old Gulf War veteran to shopping for explosive components and allegedly renting a Ryder truck to transport the bomb.</p>
<p>Now, Jones and his defence team must cast doubt on the government's case, which is built on a wealth of circumstantial evidence but contains serious gaps.</p>
<p>Jones said it was too early to tell how long the defence case would last, but lawyers observing the trial have estimated a period of between five and 10 days.</p>
<p>&quot;The defence has to convince the jury that the sound and light show of the prosecution is just that,&quot; said Denver criminal defence attorney David Japha.</p>
<p>Several legal analysts said the defence must do more than poke holes in the prosecution's case. &quot;It's unwise to try to nickel and dime the prosecution's case to death,&quot; Precht said. Instead the defence must provide jurors an alternate theory to the one the government put forth.</p>
<p>The defence has some weapons in its arsenal. While the prosecution provided volumes of evidence, it had no witness who placed McVeigh near the federal building on the day of the bombing and his fingerprints were not found on key pieces of evidence.</p>
<p>McVeigh pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring and carrying out the bombing, and faces the death penalty if convicted.</p>
<p>The defence will zero in on shoddy practices at the Federal Bureau of Investigation laboratory which handled case evidence. However, lawyers following the case said it was not certain whether the defence will call FBI agent and whistleblower Frederic Whitehurst to the stand.</p>
<p>In a recent Justice Department report on deficient operations at the laboratory, Whitehurst, while applauded for disclosing problems, also came in for criticism.</p>
<p>The defence was expected to call Dr. John Lloyd, a British explosives expert to the stand, Precht said.</p>
<p>Lawyers also expected the defence to call Lea McGown to testify. The owner of the Dreamland Motel in Junction City, Kansas, insisted she saw McVeigh in a Ryder truck three days before the bombing -- one day before the prosecution claimed McVeigh rented the truck used to transport the bomb.</p>
<p>The spectre of John Doe No. 2 remained in the background. A man delivering Chinese food to a hotel room in Junction City, where the government claims McVeigh stayed, said McVeigh was not the man who took the food. The defence maintained that authorities arrested the wrong man.</p>
<p>Eldon Elliott, the owner of the truck rental depot, testified McVeigh was not wearing gloves when he rented the truck. Not until FBI fingerprint specialist Louis Hupp admitted under cross-examination that he could find no prints at the depot, was the point about the gloves brought home, Japha said.</p>
