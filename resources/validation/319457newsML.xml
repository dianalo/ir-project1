<p>Egyptian shares rallied to another record high on Monday as investors converged heavily on most sectors of the market, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) overall index topped Sunday's record close by 7.03 points and ended at 337.04 points. Turnover was a heavy 90.87 million pounds ($26.7 million).</p>
<p>&quot;Egypt is attracting a lot of attention and the upward pressure on almost all sectors is high,&quot; said broker Sherif Cararah of EFG-Hermes. &quot;Investors are pouring money in.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers and market analysts said that an investment-grade rating by international rating agency Standard &amp; Poors and P/E ratios of around 12 percent have helped put the market in focus.</p>
<p>Eipico/Egyptian International Pharmaceuticals was the day's most active share, rising 5.0 pounds to 180 in trading worth 26.7 million pounds.</p>
<p>Brokers said they thought the government-run holding company was selling part of its stake in the firm via the bourse. Eipico was among the state's first partial privatisations.</p>
<p>Market star Heliopolis Housing and Development was absent from the day's top 10 most active shares but sister firm Medinet Nasr Housing and Development made it with trading worth more than 2.7 million pounds. Medinet Nasr shares rose 2.0 pounds to 417.</p>
<p>Cement firms also dominated the day's trading and mostly ended higher. Brokers said the blue chip sector continued to attract attention despite being overshadowed by realty firms.</p>
<p>Amriyah Cement was the sector's most active share, rising 0.01 to 71 pounds in heavy turnover worth 10.2 million. Egyptian Portland Tora Cement rose 2.5 pounds to 88.5 and Suez Cement ended 1.15 pounds higher at 66.15.</p>
<p>The index for openly traded firms rose to 544.32 points from 530.98 on Sunday and the index for rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms also rose to 226.92 from 219.45.</p>
<p>Of the 79 shares traded, 46 gained, 13 lost and 20 ended the day unchanged.</p>
