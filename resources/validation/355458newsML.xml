<p>The German post ministry said on Tuesday it doubted it or the European Union could force Deutsche Telekom AG to sell its cable-TV network, despite rising pressure from potential competitors to do so.</p>
<p>Unlike American antitrust rules, German and EU laws lack the power to force a sale, said Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, the ministry's head of international affairs.</p>
<p>Scheurle, speaking at a cable-TV industry conference, also said wireless technology and other legal steps could allow competitors to offer TV and future video services without forcing the network's sale.</p>
<p>But the European Commission was still widely expected to support a forced sale in a report next month.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if there were instruments to force Telekom to sell the cable system, an indisputable need to do so would have to be shown,&quot; he said. &quot;In view of the competitive possibilities that are available, no such need is foreseeable today.&quot;</p>
<p>The European Commission is reportedly weighing whether to force Telekom to sell the cable system, put it into a holding company or break it up into regional companies.</p>
<p>Commission deputy Marcel Haag, also speaking at the Euroforum conference, would not discuss the details of the report. But he said the planned liberalisation of EU telecom markets next year would bring new concerns into play.</p>
<p>&quot;On January 1, 1998, cable networks in Europe will turn into telecommunications networks, and will be regulated as telecommunications infrastructures,&quot; Haag said.</p>
<p>Telekom officials have said they had no plans to sell the TV business, which includes Germany's cable backbone as well as regional cable systems. Telekom has 5.5 million direct cable customers, but serves 16 million through its trunk network.</p>
<p>Competitors and government officials including Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt have called for divestment because the cable system could compete with Telekom's phone network in providing voice, video and Internet services.</p>
<p>&quot;The cable network is owned by a market-dominating national concern,&quot; said Elmar Mueller, a member of parliament from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat party. Telekom has &quot;no incentive to use it to compete in telecommunications.&quot;</p>
<p>The EU was also concerned European phone companies could use revenue from dominant cable TV businesses to subsidise phone rates and squeeze out telecom competition, Haag said.</p>
<p>Yet Scheurle maintained Bonn could foster competition without a sale by letting competitors connect to Telekom's cable network and offer video services over Telekom's lines. Companies could also run their own lines to customers' homes.</p>
<p>Wireless technology could in the near future enable other companies to deliver services over a &quot;wireless local loop&quot; that would bypass Telekom's cables altogether, he said.</p>
