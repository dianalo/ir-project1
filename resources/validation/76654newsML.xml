<p>Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said on Wednesday he saw an active role for Austria in the economic and political future of the European Union, but that his country's 41-year neutrality would not be compromised.</p>
<p>&quot;Austria has a full and important role to play in the EU,&quot; he told a news conference after a meeting with European Commission President Jacques Santer.</p>
<p>But asked how far Austria was prepared to go to agree to proposals for more EU cooperation in defence, he said: &quot;Our status of neutrality will not change&quot;.</p>
<p>Austria is a member of the Partnership for Peace, which links the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and former Eastern bloc countries -- and also has observer status within the Western European Union (WEU), the future defence arm of the EU.</p>
<p>Vranitzky said, however, that these links -- along with Austria's participation in peacekeeping forces in Cyprus and Bosnia -- did not affect neutrality.</p>
<p>The EU is debating closer defence links as part of the inter-governmental conference (IGC), the EU's reworking of its treaties,</p>
<p>Negotiators have been considering amending the treaties to involve the EU, using the WEU, in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions.</p>
<p>Finland and Sweden, which along with Ireland make up the bloc's other neutrals, have promoted this idea. Vranitzky was non-commital about the plan.</p>
<p>Austria, perched on the former Cold War border between the feuding Eastern and Western blocs, has been neutral since 1955, when it drew up its post-World War Two constitution.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, which occupied Austria after the war with allies Britain, France and the United States, demanded Austria enshrine neutrality as a central pillar of its national charter before it agreed to withdraw its troops.</p>
