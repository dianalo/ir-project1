<p>French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette called on the international community on Tuesday to act immediately to halt a humanitarian disaster in Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;Six months ago, I denounced the world's weak-kneed attitude. Today, again, I repeat that this tragedy demands an immediate reaction from the international community,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>De Charette said he had discussed the subject during the day with European Union foreign ministers. His spokesman added later that de Charette had also spoken on the telephone with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</p>
<p>&quot;The two ministers spoke of the meeting between rebel leader Laurent Kabila and President Mobutu Sese Seko Mobutu. They also spoke of the humanitarian situation. Mr de Charette said that France and the United States must act together to stop distress and suffering,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said Albright had indicated that Washington might press Rwanda to try and facilitate the settlement of Rwandan refugees.</p>
<p>The French minister said he was pleading for special help for tens of thousands of Rwandan refugees, &quot;men, women and children abandoned to a horrible fate in the African forest&quot;.</p>
<p>He was referring to Hutu refugees who advancing Zairean rebels, many of them Tutsi enemies of the Hutus, are accused of driving into the jungle in the hope they will die there.</p>
<p>De Charette's statement, made at a specially convened briefing, came as the United States, France's rival for influence in the region, took diplomatic centre stage in Zaire.</p>
<p>De Charette called for a Mobutu-Kabila meeting even as U.S. troubleshooter Bill Richardson said such a meeting was already arranged.</p>
<p>&quot;I am happy that both men have agreed to meet,&quot; Richardson said on arrival in Zaire's second city Lubumbashi from the capital Kinshasa to meet Kabila.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be working out other details with Mr Kabila on free and fair elections, the rule of law which should follow after the end of the war in Zaire,&quot; said Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.</p>
<p>Richardson also said he had a fruitful meeting with Mobutu earlier on Tuesday.</p>
<p>France, which has long backed Mobutu, has virtually no contacts with Kabila. De Charette's spokesman said Richardson would be received at the French foreign ministry on May 2.</p>
<p>There was no possibility of asking De Charette about Franco-American rivalries since he described his appeal as &quot;solemn&quot; and said in advance he would not answer questions.</p>
<p>De Charette called for aid organisations to have immediate access to refugees throughout Zaire. &quot;This situation cannot last. The world must react,&quot; he said. REUTER  291859 GMT apr 97</p>
