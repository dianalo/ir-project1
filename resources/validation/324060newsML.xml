<headline>Major to call on teenagers to join cadets - paper.</headline>

<p>Prime Minister John Major has backed plans for every British schoolchild to be given the chance to become a military cadet under plans to encourage self-disciplince, loyalty and fitness, the Times newspaper said.</p>
<p>Millions of pounds would be spent on setting up new centres in schools and inner-city areas, equipping them and recruiting former service personnel to train the cadets, the paper said in its Thursday edition.</p>
<p>The plan to extend Britain's 130,000-strong cadet force, which could be announced next month, is being backed by Major, Defence Secretary Michael Portillo and Education Secretary Gillian Shephard, the Times said.</p>
<p>An announcement in the run-up to the next election would enable the ruling Conservative Party to espouse a policy that would clearly differentiate it from the opposition Labour Party, which has become increasingly centrist in other areas.</p>
<p>Major, whose party is trailing Labour by about 17 points in opinion polls, must call an election by May.</p>
<p>According to their biographers, neither Major nor Portillo took the opportunity to join the cadets when they were at school.</p>
<p>Cadet forces, designed to instil military virtues in teenagers, exist at 198 private schools but at only 45 state schools.</p>
<p>Portillo was quoted as saying: &quot;The cadets are a good thing because they help young people to develop self-discipline, self-motivation and qualities of leadership.</p>
<p>&quot;They make young people team players, give them self-esteem and satisfy their love of adventure. For some young people they point the way to a career in the military, for others they simply lead to more knowledge about themselves.&quot;</p>
