<p>Peru survived the dreaded trip to the thin air of La Paz when they drew 0-0 away to Bolivia on Sunday to gain a precious World Cup qualifying point.</p>
<p>Bolivia twice hit the post in dramatic second half which also saw Peru miss two golden chances on the counter-attack.</p>
<p>Bolivia had won their previous seven home World Cup matches at the Hernando Silas stadium, which lies 3,600 metres above sea level. Their victims included mighty Brazil, beaten 2-0 in 1993.</p>
<p>They won all four home games on their way to reaching the 1994 World Cup finals and beat Venezuela 6-1 in their first home game of the current qualifying tournament in July.</p>
<p>But a week of preparation at high altitude paid off for Peru, who after losing 4-1 away to Ecuador have drawn their last three qualifying games.</p>
<p>Peru missed three good chances on the break in a first half which saw playmaker Marco Etcheverry fire Bolivia's best chance over the crossbar when he had a free shot on the edge of the penalty area.   </p>
<p>Bolivia took control early in the second half when Erwin Sanchez, with a long range shot, and Etcheverry, from a free kick, both threatened the Peruvian goal.</p>
<p>In the 53rd minute, defender Oscar Sanchez headed against the Peruvian crossbar and three minutes later Etcheverry again hit the Peruvian woodwork with an angled shot.</p>
<p>But Bolivia, who often undo their good results at home with bad performances away, left themselves open at the back as they pressed forward.</p>
<p>In the 67th minute, Peru's Pablo Zegarra, unmarked in the penalty area, fired his shot over the bar and two minutes from the end German Carthy had another chance on the break but saw his effort saved by goalkeeper Carlos Trucco.</p>
<p>Teams:</p>
<p>Bolivia -  Carlos Trucco; Miguel Rimba, Oscar Sanchez, Juan Manuel Pena, Marco Sandy, Ivan Castillo; Julio Baldivieso, Marco Etcheverry, Erwin Sanchez (Roly Paniagua, 85th minute), Ramiro Castillo; Milton Coimbra (Jaime Moreno, 65th).</p>
<p>Peru - Julio Cesar Balerio, Manuel Marengo, Juan Reynoso, Percy Olivares, Roger Serrano (Julinho, 47th); Jose Soto, Juan Jose Jayo, Pablo Zegarra, Jose Pereda; Roberto Palacios (Jorge Soto, 81st), Flavio Maestri (German Carthy, 80th).</p>
