<headline>Gaddum says revaluation plan on agenda next week.</headline>

<p>Bundesbank deputy president Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said on Friday that the Bundesbank would discuss Bonn's revised plan for a revaluation of the central bank's assets at its next council meeting on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gaddum also told reporters at a banking conference in Frankfurt that the revaluation would not directly affect Germany's budget deficit &quot;either this year or in future&quot;.</p>
<p>Turning to the stability pact negotiated by European Union nations to ensure fiscal discipline after monetary union starts, Gaddum said he expected this to be ratified on schedule at the Amsterdam summit on June 16/17.  </p>
<p>&quot;I am working on the assumption that the current version stands and that the stability pact will be nailed down in its current form in Amsterdam,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gaddum said that the changed political landscape in Europen would be discussed &quot;as a background topic&quot; in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>The new French left-wing government has indicated it is unhappy with the stability pact and may wish to reopen it.</p>
<p>Gaddum said that when it came to assessing countries' elegibility for entry to monetary union in May 1998, the definitions laid down in the Maastricht Treaty must be applied and there was no additional room for interpretation other than that contained in the treaty.</p>
<p>Asked if he saw a risk that the Maastricht criteria would be weakened, Gaddum said &quot;No. I see no leeway to weaken the criteria, apart from that which exists in the treaty.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about the impact of the planned revaluation of assets on Bonn's budget position, Gaddum said, &quot;Measures the Bundesbank may take cannot influence the budget directly. If operations of the Bundesbank lead to higher profits, this will only influence the debt redemption fund.</p>
<p>&quot;It will not influence the deficit in this year or in years to come,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He declined to predict whether or not Germany would meet the Maastricht Treaty three percent deficit to gross domestic product this year, saying it was not the Bundesbank's job to make forecasts of this nature.</p>
<p>Gaddum declined to comment on whether the current discussions between the Bundesbank and Bonn were regarding gold and currency reserves or only currency reserves, saying be did not wish to prejudge the agreement.</p>
<p>Gaddum also denied German media reports which he said implied that the Bundesbank had participated in formulating Bonn's original asset revaluation plan.</p>
<p>He repeated that the Bundesbank had been informed of the initial plan by German Finance Minister Theo Waigel two weeks before it issued a statement rejected Bonn's first proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to deny categorically that there were consultations in advance of this,&quot; he said.</p>
