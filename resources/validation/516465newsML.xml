<p>Robbie Fowler appears for the final time this season on Saturday in a Liverpool side who must beat defending champions Manchester United if they are to win the English league title.</p>
<p>Fowler, Liverpool's top scorer this season, was sent off eight minutes from time in the 1-1 draw with Merseyside rivals Everton on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>He will be eligible to play against United but will miss Liverpool's last three league matches against Tottenham, Wimbledon and Sheffield Wednesday.</p>
<p>A win at Goodison Park by two clear goals would have given Liverpool the psychological boost of starting Saturday's match in first place.</p>
<p>Instead, they are now two points behind United who have a game in hand and a superior goal difference.</p>
<p>Fowler was banished eight minutes from time together with Everton defender David Unsworth for violent conduct after the two exchanged punches.</p>
<p>They also appeared to square up to one another again as they walked off the pitch after being shown the red card.</p>
<p>According to Liverpool skipper John Barnes who conceded he had not seen the original incident, Fowler ended up with a cut lip.</p>
<p>Despite the disappointing result, manager Roy Evans remained upbeat.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it is a big blow to lose your top scorer at this stage of the season. But it will be a very different contest against Manchester United on Saturday,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We won't be standing back, battling against long balls and an aerial attack. It will be a challenge of course, but we're looking forward to it with confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>Barnes said a win had appeared crucial on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It was really crucial for us to win tonight, and would have been good if we would have, but hopefully it is not the end of the road for us because if we beat United on Saturday we will go ahead of them.&quot;</p>
<p>However, Liverpool no longer have their destiny in their own hands.</p>
<p>United, bidding to win the league for the fourth time in five seasons, have 66 points from 33 matches, Liverpool have 64 from 34 and Arsenal, the only other title challengers, 63 from 34. United have five matches remaining while Arsenal, who play Blackburn at home on Saturday, and Liverpool both have four. (Corrects number of Arsenal matches played and remaining.)</p>
<p>Even if Liverpool do beat United, both United and Arsenal will finish above Liverpool if they win their remaining matches. And the prize for the runners-up this season is a coveted place in the expanded Champions' League next season.</p>
<p>United manager Alex Ferguson was in the crowd at Goodison Park and must have sighed with relief at the end of a match Liverpool could have won as Fowler hit the Everton woodwork twice inside a minute in the second half. The fact his nearest rivals came away with only a point has boosted considerably Ferguson's own chances of success.</p>
<p>Saturday's match, which kicks off at 1015 GMT, promises to be a lively affair. Liverpool will have to go for goals and a victory and the more they attack the more room United will have to hit them on the counter.</p>
<p>Liverpool have a good record in recent matches at Anfield against United and one man especially will be keen to at least repeat his performance in the corresponding fixture last season.</p>
<p>Fowler scored both goals in Liverpool's 2-0 win and he would be more than happy to sign off with a similar performance on Saturday.</p>

<p>Liverpool - David James; Bjorn Kvarme, Mark Wright, Stig Inge Bjornebye, Steve Harkness, Rob Jones, Dominic Matteo, Jamie Redknapp, Jason McAteer, Michael Thomas, John Barnes, Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler, Stan Collymore, Patrick Berger</p>
