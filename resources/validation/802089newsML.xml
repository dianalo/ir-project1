<p>The two Russian cosmonauts back from the fault-prone Mir space station seemed likely on Friday to start hearing criticism of their six months in space, making their transition to earth even more difficult, experts said.</p>
<p>Russian commander Vasily Tsibliyev, 43, and flight engineer Alexander Lazutkin, 39, arrived back at the Star City cosmonaut training centre outside Moscow late on Thursday to begin a period of re-adaptation to life with gravity.</p>
<p>Space agency officials and others were anxious to learn more about an accident on June 25 when, with Tsibliyev at the helm, Mir collided with its cargo resupply ship in the worst accident in its 11-year history.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be very hard on him psychologically, and hearing many of our media reports will be a blow to him,&quot; Vladimir Krivolapov, a Star City rehabilitation doctor, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though guilt has not been established, public opinion has already been formed,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Russian media reports have blamed Tsibliyev for the accident, and President Boris Yeltsin said last week &quot;human factors&quot; appeared to have caused the accident.</p>
<p>&quot;Vasily feels responsible that he didn't fulfill his scientific programme because he had to do all that repair work,&quot; Mission Control's deputy flight director and chief doctor, Igor Goncharov, told Reuters. &quot;Yeltsin's words won't have the best psychological effect on either of the crew members,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Last month, Tsibliyev developed an irregular heart beat because of stress related to the accident, but doctors said after his return on Thursday his heart was beating normally and they were satisfied with his condition.</p>
<p>The two cosmonauts will remain at Star City for a week to 10 days for recovery therapy, but they will not be cut off from news of the outside world, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't need to isolate him, and he'd demand that he not be isolated,&quot; Krivolapov said.</p>
<p>In his first public remarks about the accident, Tsibliyev said he and his flight engineer should not be made scapegoats for the craft's problems.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very easy to find someone to shoot, pop, pop, and he's gone. Who does this help?&quot; a tired but talkative Tsibliyev said as he was flown back to Moscow after the landing on Thursday in the barren steppeland of Kazakhstan. &quot;Here you can't look for who is guilty.&quot;</p>
<p>Tsibliyev called for a patient review of Mir's recent woes as officials draw their final conclusions. &quot;The commission will examine the question calmly,&quot; he said. &quot;We'll know all that they have established and they will know what we know.&quot;</p>
<p>The Mir crew did acknowledge responsibility for unplugging a vital computer last month, a mistake that sent the craft tumbling for a day before its orientation to the sun was re-established</p>
<p>But the crew did act quickly after the June 25 accident by closing off the punctured Spektr module immediately after the accident, saving the ship and probably their own lives.</p>
<p>Yeltsin on Thursday tempered his remarks last week by issuing a statement praising Tsibliyev and Lazutkin for &quot;persistence, courage and heroism&quot;.</p>
<p>The commander said however they did not deserve the title of heroes. &quot;What is heroism? Someone who perishes under a tank in an explosion, I understand that to be heroism,&quot; he said. &quot;We are alive and have returned.&quot;</p>
