<p>High sulphur fuel oil prices on Thursday were expected to be stuck in a similar range as Wednesday with most traders mixed on market direction.</p>
<p>Bid/asked for cash 180-cst supplies for October loading were at $115-$118 per tonne, while Wednesday's was $115-$117.</p>
<p>Some traders said while prices might climb further on Chinese demand, the upside is limited.</p>
<p>&quot;China has been buying a lot of supplies from South Korea and Japan but not from Singapore&quot; said a Japanese trader.  </p>
<p>Bids have been heard around $128 a tonne for cargoes to be delivered to China in October, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;While demand from China may have risen, stocks in this region has also increased,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Residues stocks in Singapore rose 519,000 barrels to 9.737 million barrels, according to statistics released by the Trade Development Board of Singapore.</p>
<p>Traders said there are increased MidEast supplies seen heading eastwards with around four cargoes from Kuwait.  </p>
<p>Some sources said Kuwait has already sold five cargoes of 380-cst supplies in October at around $2 a tonne premium to Singapore quotes on a cost-and-freight basis.</p>
<p>Pockets of demand were seen from Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, which could help support Singapore prices, they said.</p>
<p>October paper was bid/asked at $115.25-$116.25, below Wednesday's quotes at $115.50-$116.50, tracking crude losses.</p>
