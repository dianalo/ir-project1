<p>Shares in the shale oil hopefuls Central Pacific Minerals NL and Southern Pacific Petroleum NL, commonly known as the Rundle Twins, skyrocketed on Wednesday after saying they had agreed with financiers to proceed with the stage one development of the Stuart shale oil deposit.</p>
<p>By 11.50 a.m. (0150 GMT), Central Pacific Minerals shares were A$1.25 higher at A$11.00, while Southern Pacific Petroleum shares were 59 cents higher at A$4.57.</p>
<p>The Stuart Shale project in central Queensland is being developed jointly between the Rundle Twins and Canada's Suncor Inc.  </p>
<p>&quot;They have had a bit of a move on the back of the announcement,&quot; said dealer Phillip Toop of Brisbane-based brokerage, Lance Jones, noting that the companies ADR's had moved ahead sharply in U.S. trading.</p>
<p>&quot;They were both pushed up strongly in New York last night and that has followed through here.&quot;</p>
<p>The companies said they had secured overall funding commitment for up to A$114 million for stage one.  </p>
<p>Stuart stage one is the first of three planned stages to develop the oil shale deposit and involves construction of a plant to produce 4,500 barrels of oil per day at an estimated cost of A$250 million.</p>
<p>The companies said subsequent stages could raise production progressively to a total of 95,000 barrels per day with the prospect of additional production thereafter.</p>
