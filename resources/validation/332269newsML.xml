<p>Australia hoped to sell up to 200,000 tonnes of wheat a month to Iraq from April onwards under that country's food-for-oil programme, Nigel Officer, general manager international, Australian Wheat Board (AWB), said on Friday.</p>
<p>This is greater than the AWB's earlier stated expectation of selling 150,000 tonnes of wheat a month to Iraq, following settlement earlier this week of a 150,000 tonne sale for March.</p>
<p>Shipment of the 250,000 tonnes for January/February were expected to begin next week, Officer told Reuters.  </p>
<p>The AWB had applied for physical execution of the contracted 250,000 tonnes under UN sanctions. This required full funds to be lodged in the escrow account of the UN, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the funds are there, we can start shipping,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand that the funds, if they are not there in their entirety, are almost there, and we would expect to hear very soon. Our guess is that we would be in a position to move next week sometime,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Australia's wheat sales to Iraq were the first under the UN food-for-oil deal for any commodity for sale from anywhere in the world, he said.  </p>
<p>AWB held a general expectation that it might see sales of up to 200,000 tonnes of wheat a month from Australia to Iraq, he said.</p>
<p>All of Australia's shipments would be to south Iraq, while European wheat would be shipped to Jordan for transportation across land into northern Iraq.</p>
<p>Officer described the Iraq deals as a windfall gain for Australia and a great boon to the Australian industry. It provided a great boost to the AWB's marketing campaign this year, he said.  </p>
<p>The deals were also good for Iraq, which was desperate for food, he said.</p>
<p>The deals represented the return of a sizeable market for the AWB and Australian growers, he said.</p>
<p>Before the Gulf War, Iraq was a consistent buyer of at least one million tonnes of Australian wheat a year.</p>
