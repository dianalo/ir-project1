<title>USA: New York girl jailed for murder of grandmother.</title>
<headline>New York girl jailed for murder of grandmother.</headline>

<p>A 15-year-old girl who helped kill her grandmother, then stuffed the body in a car, had sex with her boyfriend and played video games in the dead woman's home was jailed for seven years to life on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wendy Gardner was 13 when she and her boyfriend were charged with killing Elizabeth Gardner, 67, in upstate New York. Gardner was convicted on Feb. 21 and her boyfriend James Evans, now 18, was convicted of second-degree murder last July and is serving the maximum term.</p>
<p>Gardner tearfully apologised to Ulster County Court Judge J. Michael Bruhn and was so emotional during her sentencing that she was unable to speak at first. The county's youngest murder defendant told Bruhn she asks herself every day why she and her boyfriend committed the brutal murder but does not have an answer.</p>
<p>&quot;The judge was not happy to hear this,&quot; said Michael Miranda, an assistant district attorney for Ulster County who prosecuted the case. &quot;Before she is eligible for parole at 21, she will have to give a reason.&quot;</p>
<p>The girl received less than the maximum nine-years-to-life sentence because Evans was the one who actually killed Gardner by strangling her with a kite string. She will remain in a state youth detention facility in Valhalla until she is 18 when she will be moved to a woman's prison.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers said the grandmother was a church-going strict disciplinarian who abused Wendy. They claimed the girl was innocent and was under the influence of Evans, described by court psychiatrists as a sociopath who tortured cats.</p>
<p>The teenage couple had plotted the woman's death for several weeks and had considered shooting her, chopping her up or stabbing her. On the night of the murder, Gardner said she told Evans to &quot;just do it,&quot; and ran upstairs and hid with her younger sister, Kathy.</p>
<p>Kathy, 11 at the time of the murder, testified at the trial that Wendy forcibly kept her in the house and threatened to kill her if she went to police. After three days she escaped to a neighbour who called police.</p>
<p>The couple stuffed the woman's body in her car trunk and drove around town for a few days, using $880 they stole from her to buy video games, candy, sneakers and lingerie and go bowling. They also had sex in the room where they strangled the grandmother, who had taken Wendy and her sister into her home in 1986 after their parents gave up custody of the girls.</p>
<p>Their mother was a drug-addicted prostitute who died of AIDS last year and their father admitted to causing his own father to have a fatal heart attack after an argument.</p>
