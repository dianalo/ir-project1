<p>A Coast Guard helicopter with four crew members crashed in rough seas during a rescue mission off the northern California coast, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>The helicopter went down late Sunday night after responding to a distress call from a Canadian vessel 57 miles west of Cape Mendocino, about 200 miles north of San Francisco, the Coast Guard said.</p>
<p>Search teams Monday found the tail section of the helicopter but did not locate the crew members, a Coast Guard spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an intensive search. We're hoping for the best,&quot; Coast Guard spokeswoman Shannon Knight said.</p>
<p>The missing helicopter was last heard from at 11:25 p.m. PDT Sunday (2:25 a.m. Monday EDT). At the time, the seas were very rough, with waves 26 feet high and winds gusting from 35 to 55 knots.</p>
<p>&quot;It was nasty as hell,&quot; Coast Guard spokesman Bruce Pimental said. &quot;That's rough weather.&quot;</p>
<p>Coast Guard cutters, rescue helicopters and a plane were used in the search. Other rescue vessels were expected to join them Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard said rescue helicopters will search after dark using night vision equipment.</p>
<p>The four missing helicopter crew members were identified as: Lt. Jeffery Crane from Massachusetts, Lt. Charles Thigpen from California, Petty Officer Richard Hughes from Arizona and Petty Officer James Caines from Georgia.</p>
<p>The five crew members aboard the Canadian sail boat, the Ezra II, were rescued and were in good condition, the Coast Guard said. Their 37-foot-long boat, travelling from Vancouver to San Francisco, was disabled when it lost its rudder. They were forced to abandon ship and were rescued from a raft.</p>
<p>The crew members rescued from the Canadian vessel were: Nigel Rennie of Britain, William Logan of Canada, Larry Murrell of Canada, Shirley Minion of Canada, and Murray Tildesley of the United States.</p>
