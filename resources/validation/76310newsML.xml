<p>Just as seasonal demand for precious metals is picking up, prices have tumbled.</p>
<p>Gold is weak. Silver is at an 18-month low. Platinum and palladium are cheaper than at any time in three years. And the retreat may continue amid fiercely bearish sentiment even as demand strengthens, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is a view in the market, it is usually strong enough to override the seasonal factor,&quot; bullion analyst Andy Smith of Union Bank of Switzerland said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems since the end of August the (investment) funds have had a view, and they're pessimistic,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Typically, the middle of September is a signal for an increase in gold demand from Asia as well as from U.S. and European jewellery fabricators.</p>
<p>But any seasonal boost has been overshadowed so far by a big speculative play led by U.S. funds last week. It sent silver plunging below its key $5 an ounce level, and its weakness has spilled over into the other precious metals.</p>
<p>Gold, already stuck in a protracted downtrend, reacted to silver's sell-off by easing to fresh two-month lows just above the technically significant $380 an ounce level.</p>
<p>Bullion fixed at $383.25 an ounce on Wednesday, compared to around $415 at the start of the year.</p>
<p>Technical analysts who study charts of historical prices to calculate future trends, said gold's staying power above $380 held the key to the rest of the precious metals.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got a divergence between gold and silver at the moment, where silver seems to be breaking down and gold isn't,&quot; said Cliff Green of Trend Analysis.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all eyes on gold -- if it remains above $380, then maybe there's upside potential for silver.&quot; If not, however, the complex is liable to crumble further.</p>
<p>Silver had dropped to 18-month lows last week and was still vulnerable to losses to as low as $4.50 an ounce, Green said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday it was off lows but still vulnerable at around $4.94 an ounce. Silver, an industrial metal, is more volatile than gold and therefore an obvious target for speculators.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very easy to move the silver market around and I guess people got tired of waiting for see prices move up to $6,&quot; said Kevin Crisp, an analyst at JP Morgan.</p>
<p>Platinum and palladium have also come under pressure from silver after being undermined over the summer by steady supplies from producer Russia and slack industrial demand.</p>
<p>Platinum has hovered around 2-1/2 year lows in recent days and its stablemate palladium dipped to three-year lows.</p>
<p>Analysts said demand for gold bullion will rise as jewellers establish inventories for Christmas and Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand is looking reasonably good at this point,&quot; said Crisp of J.P. Morgan. &quot;The sentiment is uniformly bearish for the metals, but that could mean there are some surprises in store.&quot;</p>
<p>But so far, the demand trickling in has done little more than put support under the market rather than lead prices up. &quot;The physical demand is taking up the surplus and slowing the decline. It's not enough to tip the balance,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>That's because professional investors have turned up their noses at the precious metals.</p>
<p>Gold's traditionally role as a &quot;safe haven&quot; in times of political and economic crisis has been called into question as investors turn to more profitable stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>A proposal by the International Monetary Fund to sell some gold reserves has also cast a pall on gold, though analysts say the market would easily absorb the amount in question.</p>
<p>&quot;Funds are fickle, they don't care if it's gold or green cheese. They bought it in January, they're selling it now. The flucutations and flows are background noise,&quot; UBS's Smith said.</p>
