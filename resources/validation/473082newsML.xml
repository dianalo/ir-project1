<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy began a Middle East rescue mission in Morocco on Thursday by charting Arab-Israeli peace moves with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.</p>
<p>The envoy, Dennis Ross, met Arafat for almost two hours in the Moroccan capital Rabat at the start of a lightning bid to get Israelis and Palestinians to stop fighting and start talking.</p>
<p>Officials said he then headed for Israel where he would meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late in the day and again on Friday along with Israel's foreign and defence ministers.</p>
<p>In Rabat, Ross told Reuters he would return to Washington by the weekend to report to Clinton so the &quot;president can decide what the next proper move should be&quot;.</p>
<p>West Bank clashes triggered by Israel's groundbreaking on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem entered an eighth day on Thursday. About 200 Palestinians hurled stones at Israeli troops who responded by firing rubber bullets near Ramallah.</p>
<p>Israeli political analysts said Ross faced as tall an order as he did last year when -- after a wave of violence claimed the lives of 61 Palestinians and 15 Israelis -- he brokered Israel's handover of most of Hebron to self-rule.</p>
<p>Asked what influence Ross would have on the two sides, Uri Saguy, a former Israeli military intelligence chief said: &quot;About as much as aspirin has on flu -- it is marginal and brings the fever down a bit but it doesn't cure the ailment itself.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said Ross could devise a formula by which Arafat would recommit to fight violence and Netanyahu would promise not to take any more unilateral steps such as last week's groundbreaking on the Jewish settlement.</p>
<p>In Damascus, an official Syrian newspaper said Ross was bringing nothing new with him.</p>
<p>&quot;What is Ross going to do if he is carrying nothing new with him?&quot; the official daily Tishreen asked in an editorial.</p>
<p>Israeli military officials warned of a potential surge of unrest climaxing on Sunday -- the annual &quot;Land Day&quot; when Israeli Arabs stage protests against government confiscation of lands.</p>
<p>Israel's Defence Ministry said the army would station tanks at the outskirts of Palestinian-ruled cities if needed to deter stone-throwers from charging soldiers at Israeli outposts.</p>
<p>Israel again urged Ross to press Arafat to crack down on Moslem militant groups. Last Friday a Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up at a Tel Aviv cafe, killing three Israeli women.</p>
<p>Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said events had cast &quot;a very dark shadow&quot; over the future of peacemaking. He insisted he was unaware of any demands the United States might place on Israel.</p>
<p>In an interview with the German news weekly Der Spiegel due to be published on Saturday, Ibrahim Ghoshe, spokesman for the Islamic militant group Hamas warned: &quot;Israel must expect more bombs to go off. Now is the time for martyrs&quot;.</p>
<p>Palestinians urged Ross to lean on Israel to halt work on the East Jerusalem hilltop settlement which the Arabs call Jabal Abu Ghneim and the Israelis call Har Homa. Palestinians regard East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, as the future capital of an independent Palestinian state.</p>
<p>At the settlement site itself, Israeli authorities said they had found three caves but insisted building would go ahead even if it turned out they contained ancient Jewish graves.</p>
<p>Ultra-orthodox Jews have in the past protested at sites accusing workmen of desecrating ancient Jewish graves and delaying construction.</p>
<p>At the United Nations, the Arab group of states planned to request an emergency special session of the General Assembly on Israel's building of homes for Jews in East Jerusalem following two U.S. vetoes in the Security Council.</p>
<p>Arafat was in Rabat to join 15 foreign ministers from Islamic countries at a meeting of the Jerusalem Committee called by Morocco's King Hassan over Israel's new settlement project.</p>
