<p>Sri Lanka is negotiating with foreign firms to develop one of the world's richest titanium ore deposits, but security concerns are rising after an attack on a foreign vessel in the area by separatist rebels, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>They said the mine, in Pulmoddai in the northeast of the country, had plenty of potential but security was a top priority after Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam guerrillas attacked a Philippine vessel loaded with 13,000 tonnes of mineral sands earlier this month.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pulmoddai mineral sands deposit is rated as one of the world's best with a heavy mineral content between 60-70 percent, higher than in India and Australia,&quot; said Douglas Jayasekera, chairman of state-owned Lanka Mineral Sands Ltd.</p>
<p>This compares with a mineral concentration of betwen 1.5-25 percent in Austalia, according to the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau in Colombo.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes Sri Lanka one of the world's cheapest mineral sands producers,&quot; Jayasekera told Reuters.</p>
<p>Officials at the bureau said the mineral sands contain ilmenite and rutile, raw materials for titanium dioxide which is used in the aerospace and pigment industries.</p>
<p>Total proven reserves of ilmenite alone at Pulmoddai, owned by Lanka Mineral Sands, is over five million tonnes, they added. Pulmoddai can produce 150,000 tonnes of ilmenite, 10,000 tonnes of rutile and 6,000 tonnes of zircon annually.</p>
<p>Jayasekera said a handful of foreign firms which produce titanium slag, titanium dioxide pigment and synthetic rutile had responded to a government invitation to form a joint venture with Lanka Mineral Sands to make value-added products.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka exports all its mineral sands production.</p>
<p>Jayasekera declined to give the names of the foreign firms.</p>
<p>The government, keen on attracting foreign investors, has stepped up security at the Pulmoddai mine, 50 km (30 miles) north of the eastern port of Trincomalee, since separatist Tamil Tiger rebels attacked the Philippine vessel.</p>
<p>Nine Sri Lankans loading the sand were wounded in the blast.</p>
<p>&quot;Buyers are not reluctant to send ships but want assurances on security,&quot; said Jayasekera, adding that navy patrols now escorted foreign ships transporting mineral sands.</p>
<p>Annual average exports, sold through cumbersome government tenders, are 50,000 tonnes of ilmenite, 70,000 tonnes of crude zircon and 2,000-3,000 tonnes of rutile, industry officials said.</p>
<p>Exports are restricted because Pulmoddai port is vulnerable to weather, they added. Shipping is limited to between April and October.</p>
<p>Lanka Mineral Sands stockpiled 200,000 tonnes of crude zircon which the company was unable to convert to zircon after Tamils rebels blew up water supplies needed for processing several years ago, industry officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the restrictions we've not done too badly,&quot; Jayasekera said. &quot;Our foreign exhange earnings were 283 million rupees ($5 million) in 1995.&quot;</p>
<p>The main buyers are Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha Ltd, a Japanese manufacturer of pigments, ACI of the United States, Derby &amp; Co of the United Kingdom, Australia's Currumbin Minerals Ltd, and India's state-owned Rare Earths Ltd, he added.</p>
