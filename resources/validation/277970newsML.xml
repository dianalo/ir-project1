<p>(Corrects name of accused throughout from &quot;Henry Sanville&quot; to &quot;Henry Overturf&quot;.)</p>
<p>Two members of the self-styled Viper Militia group accused by federal officials of plotting to blow up federal buildings changed their pleas to guilty Friday.</p>
<p>Scott Shero, 30, and Henry Overturf, 37, admitted in U.S. District Court in Phoenix to one count each of conspiring to illegally make and possess unregistered destructive devices. A third member of the militia was expected to enter a guilty plea later Friday.</p>
<p>Shero told reporters outside the courthouse in Phoenix, &quot;I just wanted to get it behind me.&quot; Overturf had no comment as he walked away. All 12 members of the Viper Militia had entered innocent pleas after their arrests in a series of raids July 1 that drew nationwide attention.</p>
<p>Much of the publicity centred on statements made by federal officials in Washington that the group may have been planning to bomb a series of buildings in the Phoenix metropolitan area.</p>
<p>In the raids, officials seized a videotape they claimed showed the targeted buildings and other videotapes showing various group members firing weapons and setting off explosions in the Arizona desert. But officials later admitted that the militia posed no imminent threat.</p>
<p>Shero and Overturf each face five years in jail but could receive reduced sentences under an agreement with prosecutors.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from federal prosecutors about the pleas on Friday but a spokeswoman said she expected 10 of the 12 militia members to change their pleas to guilty. Two leaders of the group entered guilty pleas earlier.</p>
