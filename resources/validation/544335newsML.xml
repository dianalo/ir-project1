<headline>Swedish shares end down as Ericsson, drugs plunge.</headline>

<p>The Stockholm bourse was weighed down by an early plunge by index heavyweight Ericsson on Monday and stayed between one and two percent lower throughout the session, which saw losses across the board.</p>
<p>The Stockholm bourse general index closed down 1.33 percent at 2,577.88 in heavy turnover of 4.92 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Telecoms group Ericsson ended down 12 crowns, off lows, at 237.5 after heavy falls in New York on Friday. NatWest Securities said it downgraded its Ericsson rating to hold from accumulate.</p>
<p>Some analysts pinned the fall on the first quarter result.</p>
<p>&quot;It's almost ridiculous how much we are governed by what happens in the U.S. and that's what drove the exchange down today,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical sector had a headache of a day, with first Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn  collapsing and then Astra following behind. P&amp;U report their Q1 profit on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a bit worrying to see Astra falling. First Pharmacia got attacked and then it was Astra's turn. The shares are not expensive at these levels but they look soft for a while yet,&quot; another added.</p>
