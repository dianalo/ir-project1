<p>Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), the country's biggest bank, reported an expected 1996 group net loss of 348 million francs ($235.7 million) on Friday as a result of big one-off provisions for bad domestic loans in Switzerland.</p>
<p>UBS was the first of Switzerland's three global banks to report. All three are due to post losses due to one-time charges aimed at staunching the flow of profits into credit risks caused by six years of Swiss economic stagnation.</p>
<p>Chief executive Mathis Cabiallavetta said the bank now had its provision problems under control and expected a positive year.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a good start in the first two months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Excluding the special provision and a restructuring charge of 120 million Swiss francs, &quot;group profit would have been in the region of 1.8 billion francs, seven percent more than in 1995&quot;, a UBS statement said.</p>
<p>Cabiallavetta said ordinary provisions could now be kept down to between 400 million and 600 million Swiss francs a year, freeing up income for profits that had been going to cover risky domestic loans.</p>
<p>Analysts said they saw no major surprises in the numbers and no reason to revise recommendations, most of which were &quot;hold&quot; or &quot;neutral&quot;.</p>
<p>UBS bearer shares were down slightly in a generally weakish market, trading six francs lower at 1,290 Swiss francs in late afternoon.</p>
<p>Rival bank Credit Suisse Group will report on its 1996 results on March 5 and Swiss Bank Corp on March 12.</p>
<p>UBS said it would maintain an unchanged dividend on 1996 results of 32 Swiss francs per bearer share and 6.40 francs per registered share.</p>
<p>&quot;UBS reported a good operating result for 1996. Cash flow was increased by 21 percent to 4,312 million Swiss francs,&quot; the bank said in a statement before Cabiallavetta's news conference.</p>
<p>It said return on equity (ROE), the benchmark it uses for measuring gains in profitability, was to increase to around 12 percent in the near future.</p>
<p>&quot;Provided market conditions remain reasonably favourable, we anticipate a rapid increase in our return on equity to around 12 percent,&quot; Cabiallavetta said.</p>
<p>He said this was in line with a UBS strategic objective of achieving an ROE of six to eight percent above the risk-free interest rate.</p>
<p>UBS's ROE was 7.5 percent in 1995 and would have been the same again last year if not for the extraordinary charge, which pushed the ratio down to minus 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>One key cost factor was performance bonuses in the competitive world of investment banking, where keeping and hiring experts forces many banks to offer generous packages.</p>
<p>UBS said its personnel costs rose 17 percent in 1996 to 4,857 million Swiss francs due in large part to performance bonuses for a lucrative investment banking year.</p>
<p>Cabiallavetta said UBS would now focus on expanding its asset management business and could not rule out an acquisition in major markets such as the United States.</p>
<p>He said UBS already held an excellent position in this business, particularly in Switzerland, and wanted to use it as a platform to aggressively build up its capabilities abroad. ($ = 1.476 Swiss Francs)</p>
