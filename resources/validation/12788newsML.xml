<p>A vegetarian bus driver's civil rights were violated by a municipal bus company that fired him for refusing to hand out free hamburger coupons, a federal agency has ruled.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a wonderful day for me and vegetarians everywhere because we are being taken seriously,&quot; Bruce Anderson said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>California's Orange County Transit Authority dismissed Anderson in June after he chose not to give passengers coupons from a fast-food chain that runs ads featuring sandwiches oozing sauce.</p>
<p>The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a written &quot;determination&quot; this week charging that the transit authority discriminated against the driver for &quot;his strongly held moral and ethical beliefs,&quot; and violated his civil rights.</p>
<p>Gloria Allred, his lawyer, said the Commission's ruling would add &quot;considerable weight&quot; to a civil lawsuit filed by Anderson.</p>
<p>A Commission lawyer declined comment on the charges but said the agency encourages out-of-court settlements.</p>
<p>&quot;We would certainly be open to that,&quot; said Allred.</p>
