<p>Indonesia, the world's third largest cocoa producer, is again fighting shy of suggestions that it join the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) because it opposes output cuts that might hurt its small farmers.</p>
<p>&quot;Each time there is an ICCO meeting, we will be asked if want to join them,&quot; an Indonesian official told Reuters on the sidelines of a London meeting of the ICCO, a producer/consumer group.</p>
<p>&quot;Our position remains the same. We still have no plan to join it. It's hard for us to implement its management plan because about 70 percent of our cocoa belongs to small farmers,&quot; said the official, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>Indonesia attended the meeting of the London-based ICCO as an observer.</p>
<p>Cocoa producers agreed in September to cut output by a total of 90,000 tonnes over three years starting in 1996/97 to realise a stocks/consumption ratio of 34 percent from around 50 now.</p>
<p>The official said production cuts would be detrimental to the Indonesian farmers because the country was in favour of more production to boost their income.</p>
<p>&quot;Implementing production cuts will mean cutting their (farmers) throats. For the time being, we don't have any plan to join the ICCO,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe we will join them when the time has come,&quot; he said without giving further details. Government officials in Jakarta have said Indonesia has have been wary of joining the organisation for fear it might want to limit the country's production if prices decline.</p>
<p>Indonesian Cocoa Association (INCA), on the other hand, was in favour of joining the group.</p>
<p>ICCO estimated last month Indonesia's cocoa production in the 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) to be 295,000 tonnes, making it the third largest producer after the Ivory Coast and Ghana.</p>
<p>But Asian cocoa traders believed Indonesia's cocoa bean output may expand to between 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes over the next few years, which should allow it to overtake Ghana as the the world's second largest producer by the year 2000.</p>
<p>ICCO's estimation put Ghana's 1995/96 crop season at 400,000 tonnes, while Ivory Coast's out is expected to hit 1.2 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The Indonesian official said he shared the traders' optimism his country would overtake Ghana sometime in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;There are always possibilities that our rank will be higher in the coming years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>When asked if Ghana planned to retain its position, John Henry Newman, the executive director of Ghana Cocoa Board said at the sidelines of the ICCO meeting:</p>
<p>&quot;For me, the bottom line for the Ghana Cocoa Board to supervise an industry which will continue to help generate wealth for Ghana.&quot; -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8072</p>
