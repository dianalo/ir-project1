<p>The Swiss cabinet agreed on Wednesday to give companies more time to put special labels on food containing genetically-altered soybeans, which can go on sale in Switzerland as of February 1.</p>
<p>As an interim measure, the Federal Council decide to let advisories appear instead on signs or placards displayed on shop shelves near the products. New special labels will be required as of December 31, the Interior Ministry said.</p>
<p>The signs will identify the foods as &quot;GVO products&quot;, using the German acronym for &quot;genetically altered organism&quot;.</p>
<p>The move is designed to give foreign suppliers time to inform themselves about the labelling requirements, first adopted last month when Switzerland approved such products over the objection of environmentalist activists.</p>
<p>&quot;The interim rules allow consumers to be informed comprehensively on the one hand without on the other hand forcing existing packaging material to be destroyed,&quot; the ministry said.</p>
<p>Activists say the products are a dangerous experiment with nature that could pose a risk to human health even though health authorities in several countries have approved them.</p>
<p>The new soybeans were developed by U.S. chemicals giant Monsanto Co to be resistant to its own weedkiller Roundup.</p>
<p>Some Swiss stores have refused to stock the new kind of foods, saying consumers do not want them.</p>
