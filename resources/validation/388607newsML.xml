<p>The Indian rupee ended Wednesday steady at 35.88/89 against the dollar in dull, low volume trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some demand (for dollars) in the morning,&quot; said a dealer. He said there were small deals at 35.9050, the lowest level the rupee dipped to on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The rupee continued to gain thereafter as both the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and an influential Calcutta bank continued to abstain from the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>The rupee was not expected to gain beyond 35.88 as the RBI was buying dollars at this level, dealers said.</p>
<p>The six-month annualised forward premium closed at 6.74 percent, marginally up from the previous close of 6.63 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said both receivers and payers (of premia) continued to play safe because of uncertainties over RBI intervention.</p>
<p>Last week the RBI was active in the swaps market, buying spot August and September dollars ahead of redemption of India Development Bonds on February 14.</p>
<p>&quot;He (RBI) intervened again on Monday,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank. &quot;Yesterday he made enquiries but did not intervene,&quot; he said. &quot;So payers (banks seeking forward cover) are not willing to pay higher premia,&quot; he said.</p>
