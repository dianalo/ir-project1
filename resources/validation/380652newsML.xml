<p>Cheated pyramid scheme investors marched for an 11th day in this southern Albanian port city and others set out for nearby Fier to join demonstrations there.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to go to Fier&quot; and &quot;Let's march on Fier&quot;, a crowd of some 1,000 people shouted before the 40-km (25-mile) trip north.</p>
<p>Scuffles broke out in Fier on Friday when 100 riot police tried to keep about 5,000 protesters from the town's square.</p>
<p>Anti-government protests were held in about a dozen towns around Albania on Friday to call on the right-wing government of Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi to reimburse investors and then resign.</p>
<p>Demonstrators in Fier, enraged after men attacked a protest on Thursday, threw stones at police trying to keep them from marching on Friday.</p>
<p>Police quickly gave ground, leaving an uneasy calm in the town. Tension was high ahead of expected protests on Saturday.</p>
<p>Anti-government protesters have also erected barricades on the main north-south road between Fier and Vlore, cutting the link between Albania's second port and the capital in Tirana.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to separate from the rest of Albania, we do not recognise (President Sali) Berisha any more,&quot; one protester shouted at motorists trying to get through.</p>
<p>Protesters in Vlore on Saturday carried a picture of Artur Rustemi, 33, who was shot dead during clashes on Monday. The procession filed past the site of his killing, lighting candles and placing plastic flowers on the spot.</p>
<p>Protests were expected in numerous other towns on Saturday, including Tepelene in the south and Mirdite in the north.</p>
<p>The anti-government protests show no sign of abating, with angry investors who lost millions of dollars in savings vowing to keep up pressure until the government quits.</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters in the southern town of Gjirokaster lit candles on Friday and formed the word &quot;Vlore&quot; in a show of solidarity.</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters carrying bouquets of flowers turned out in Elbasan, south of Tirana. One of the slogans of the main opposition Forum for Democracy is &quot;With flowers, not stones&quot;. Protests were reported in the port of Durres and in Cerrik.</p>
<p>Albania, Europe's poorest country, was swept by protests and riots after investors lost their savings in the failed investment schemes.</p>
<p>The schemes lured new money with offers of high interest rates and then used the cash to pay earlier investors. A large proportion of Albania's adults seem to have joined the schemes.</p>
<p>The companies often built holiday resorts, petrol stations, motels, supermarket chains and other high-profile investments, giving the illusion of success.</p>
<p>Their offices were often guarded by police and ministers joined in ground-breaking ceremonies, giving the impression that the schemes were sanctioned by the government.</p>
<p>That has lead many investors to turn their wrath on Berisha and Meksi, blaming them for letting the dubious schemes evolve. Opposition parties accuse him of using cash from the schemes to finance an election campaign last year.</p>
<p>The government, in turn, says opposition groups are trying to exploit the crisis. It impounded about $300 million from two failed funds but steadfastly refused to use government money to reimburse luckless investors.</p>
<p>The head of the state Savings Bank, Bedri Collaku, said $4.3 million had been distributed so far to investors in the failed Populli scheme. The government froze more than $100 million of Populli's assets last month.</p>
<p>Some estimates put the losses from the collapsed schemes at $2 billion, about the size of Albania's annual gross domestic product. Five national schemes have now officially gone bust.</p>
<p>Four more companies, which deny they are pyramids and say they are corporate holdings, have drastically cut back their interest payments and have frozen depositors' assets.</p>
