<p>Seven South Asian nations, disappointed over the slow pace of economic integration, have agreed to launch a review to revitalise their 12-year-old regional bloc, diplomats said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Foreign ministers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) agreed during weekend talks to create a special group of experts to try to breathe fresh life into the bloc, they said.</p>
<p>SAARC leaders were expected to endorse the creation of the &quot;eminent persons group&quot; during a three-day summit in this Indian Ocean island nation set to start on Monday.</p>
<p>Maldivian Foreign Minister Fatullah Jameel told a news conference that the group would &quot;identify measures to revitalise and enhance the effectiveness&quot; of SAARC.</p>
<p>In recent years, SAARC has focused on lowering regional trade barriers as a means of spurring cross-border commerce. But trade among the the seven member states -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- accounts for only three percent of their total trade.</p>
<p>SAARC member states have been frustrated in their efforts to combat poverty. The region, which with 1.2 billion people has one fifth of the world's population, accounts for 40 percent of those living in poverty, according to the Islamabad-based Human Development centre.</p>
<p>&quot;The performance of SAARC has not been as we expected,&quot; Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;So once we review our shortcomings and our strong points, then we can project ourselves ahead rather than keep on entering into new ventures, new agreements, when ones earlier agreed upon have not been completed.&quot;</p>
<p>Pakistan proposed that the group include former SAARC secretaries general, former foreign secretaries of member states, former ambassadors and other &quot;prominent people,&quot; Khan said.</p>
<p>Jameel said, &quot;We felt we should take stock of what we have been doing and what has been done so that in the future there would be more action-oriented activities which yield results in a more visible manner felt by us more.&quot;</p>
<p>The foreign ministers, who prepared the agenda for their leaders' meeting starting on Monday, patched up a festering disagreement that had threatened to sour the SAARC summit.</p>
<p>Pakistan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka had objected to a proposed sub-regional group linking Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal, saying it was at odds with the spirit of SAARC.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers agreed that countries could reach sub-regional agreements provided they involved specific projects and other SAARC members were kept informed.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been sorted out. It's no longer an issue,&quot; Khan said.</p>
<p>The ministers pledged to accelerate efforts to liberalise regional trade by negotiating market-opening measures that applied to all sectors. In the past, SAARC has concentrated on industry-specific moves and not taken across-the-board steps.</p>
<p>They also agreed that a free-trade zone should be created in the shortest possible time, Jameel said. SAARC member states had previously agreed to set up the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) by no later than 2005.</p>
<p>The SAARC states vowed to expand visa exemptions and simplify visas procedures to spur greater travel and interchange.</p>
<p>Jameel threw cold water on India's suggestion that SAARC consider launching a single currency. &quot;We can't simply say we want SAARC to develop like the EU (European Union),&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think it is a very simple matter to finalise or implement.&quot;</p>
