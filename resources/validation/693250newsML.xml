<p>The United States on Friday shrugged off the announcement that China would send 4,000 troops into Hong Kong on July 1 soon after the British colony reverts to Chinese control.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand that this is what was always expected, that they would be garrisoning up to 10,000 troops in Hong Kong, and this is the first wave,&quot; said a White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry, couching his reaction in diplomatic language, said the United States was &quot;aware of procedures that have been in place for the orderly transfer of garrisons&quot; in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously we closely monitor the commitments that both the United Kingdom and the People's Republic have made pursuant to their 1984 agreement (for the reversion of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United States and other leaders of the world's rich industrial nations plus Russia, at their summit last weekend in Denver, Colorado, urged China to respect Hong Kong's vibrant democracy and economy when it retakes control.</p>
<p>&quot;They've always said they were going to put Chinese troops where the British troops were. That's not anything unusual. It's their territory,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>In London, the British government worried that China's decision might send a &quot;negative signal&quot; to Hong Kong's people and the world.</p>
