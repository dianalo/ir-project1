<headline>Gymboree's profits flat after charge.</headline>
<dateline>BURLINGAME, Calif.</dateline>
<text>
<p>Gymboree Corp. said Wednesday its fiscal first-quarter profits were virtually unchanged from a year ago after it took a one-time charge related to the departure of its chief executive in February.</p>
<p>The company, which makes and sells clothing and accessories for young children, said net income for the 13 weeks ended May 3 edged up to $8.60 million, or 34 cents a share, from $8.59 million, which also equalled 34 cents a share.</p>
<p>Gymboree, which offers parent-child developmental play programmes at some 375 franchised centres, said its latest results included an after-tax charge of 2 cents a share, or $510,000, related to the resignation of Nancy Pedot as president and CEO.</p>
<p>The company, which is based in Burlingame, Calif., did not offer any further details about the charge.</p>
<p>Without the charge, it said, net income would have risen by 7 percent to $9.2 million, or 36 cents a share.</p>
<p>Gymboree said its net sales jumped by 23 percent to $85.2 million from $69.1 million, although sales at stores opened at least one year grew by only 2 percent.</p>
<p>Gary White, who succeeded Pedot as president and CEO, said sales were affected by a general decline in retail sales after Easter, which resulted in higher April markdowns than the company had planned.</p>
<p>Gymboree's stock lost 62.5 cents to $22.875 in early afternoon trading on the Nasdaq market.</p>
