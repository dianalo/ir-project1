<p>Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, said on Saturday a revamped European exchange rate mechanism dubbed &quot;ERM2&quot; could be used to influence monetary policies of non-EMU member states.</p>
<p>&quot;Implementation (of ERM2) is on course and I think we have learned the lesson from ERM1 and therefore I think there is quite a high probability that ERM2 would work,&quot; Lamfalussy said during a lecture in Hungary.</p>
<p>&quot;For the countries who will not be part of the monetary union right at the beginning ERM2 represents a carrot,&quot; he added. &quot;It is through it that they can actually join the monetary union.&quot;</p>
<p>ERM2 is designed to provide a link between the euro and currencies of EU members which are not among the first to join the European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999.</p>
<p>Hungary, Czech Republic and Poland are expected to qualify and be admitted to the EU early next century, even if their currencies do not immediately qualify them for EMU.</p>
<p>Lamfalussy said the new exchange rate mechanism, which will link the euro to other currencies in relatively wide trading bands, would have a stabilising influence on countries outside the EMU area.</p>
<p>&quot;In other words, they have a vested interest in pursuing policies which do not lead to major misalignments because that would exclude them from the objective,&quot; he said at the lecture organised by European University Society for Financial Research (SUERF) and the Robert Triffin-Szirak Foundation.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm quite sure that if in 1990-93 we had been at a similar stage of monetary union as we are today it would have been possible to deal with the 90-93 crisis in a different way,&quot; said Lamfalussy, who heads the forerunner of a European central bank.</p>
<p>Both the lira and sterling were ejected from the ERM in September 1992 during a crisis which nearly led to collapse of the rate mechanism.</p>
