<p>Heavily armed Tutsi rebels held the eastern Zairean city of Bukavu on Friday and civilians trickled back, two days after the rout of Zairean troops and militiamen there.</p>
<p>As one of two foreign journalists trapped in Bukavu during the fighting, I saw its fall to lines of well-equipped rebels in uniforms and carrying mortar bombs on their heads through the streets.</p>
<p>The swift end for Zairean government control over Bukavu, the biggest city now in rebel hands, began on Tuesday when the rebels attacked troops and unruly militiamen with mortar bombs, machineguns and automatic weapons in mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>We were visiting the Hotel Residence in the north of the city to see the South Kivu province's Military Governor General Elesse Yombentole when pandemonium erupted with soldiers running back and forth.</p>
<p>Hundreds of militiamen and troops suddenly started streaming down past the hotel from the southern entrances of the city.</p>
<p>The general went up to his room at the hotel to get his gun and with a band of bodyguards rushed out. During the rest of the afternoon tens of thousands of civilians fled Bukavu, most on foot.</p>
<p>We saw some 10 wounded and the rebel attack raged on until 10 p.m. at night. Fighting resumed on Wednesday morning and we watched as more civilians fled to the north. We saw a few dead lying in the street.</p>
<p>At noon rebels seized a key mortar position on the top of a hill in the centre of the city and started firing tens of mortar bombs towards retreating Zairean forces to the north.</p>
<p>In the afternoon hundreds of rebels walked in through the centre of town heading north. They were well-disciplined and well-organised and set up checkpoints throughout the city.</p>
<p>Unlike Zairean troops who looted aid agencies and civilian homes in the last few days of fighting, the rebels politely explain why they are here and ask civilians to stay rather than flee.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Zaireans stayed in the city during the fighting and some ethnic Tutsis, who said they were hiding from Zairean troops and militiamen, have emerged and reported killings by Rwandan Hutu militiamen and people with clubs and machetes.</p>
<p>One man said he hid in the roof of his home since September 17. He said he knew of a whole family of seven killed last Saturday and another four Tutsis killed around the same time.</p>
<p>Rebel commanders say they are Zairean and speak a variety of languages including Swahili, Lingala, French and English.</p>
<p>Zaire says Rwandan, Burundian and Ugandan soldiers are fighting alongside the rebels.</p>
<p>We met 20 women on Friday who said they had been held in the Zairean civil guard prison in Bukavu for two weeks. They started to cry every time they attempted to talk about their ordeal.</p>
<p>Roman Catholic Archbishop of Bukavu Christophe Munzihirwa was killed on Tuesday by crossfire hitting his car. Church leaders, after asking rebel permission, buried him on Thursday in the cathedral grounds.</p>
<p>The city has had no electricity since Tuesday. A large number of foreigners are staying in a religious compound.</p>
<p>Rebels are entering Zairean army barracks and removing weapons and munitions left behind by the fleeing forces.</p>
<p>Some witnesses said they saw between 20 and 30 people summarily killed by Zairean troops before they left the city.</p>
<p>I saw the body of a man on Wednesday in an area of Bukavu then still held by Zairean troops who had been apparently executed because he was lying on his knees with a bullet in his head.</p>
<p>The rebels have also been searching each house, looking for suspected Zairean soldiers in hiding. By the end of Thursday, they had about 10 prisoners they said they were investigating.</p>
