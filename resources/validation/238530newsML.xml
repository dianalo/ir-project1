<text>
<p>Germany's central bank Thursday left its key discount and Lombard interest rates unchanged, as most economists had expected.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank kept the discount rate at 2.50 percent and the Lombard emergency financing rate at 4.50 percent. The central bank's main money market rate, the repo, was also left unchanged at 3 percent.</p>
<p>Economists had generally agreed that a cut in the bank's leading interest rates was extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly were not looking for anything on rates today,&quot; said Thomas Mayer, senior international economist at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Although soft October industrial output data fanned some speculation the Bundesbank might be tempted to nudge rates still lower in a bid to help economic growth, the central bank reiterated recently that it sees no need to adjust rates now.</p>
