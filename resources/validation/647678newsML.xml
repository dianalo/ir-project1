<title>UK: LIFFE white sugar drifts lower in light volume.</title>

<p>White sugar futures headed lower in tight ranges and muted volume on Monday but light mixed buying kept nearby August hovering above initial support at $325, traders said.</p>
<p>After a flurry of fund-inspired buying at the start of last week, which pushed August to a high of $330.80, the position has steadily retraced as profits were taken.</p>
<p>The $330.80 high was the culmination of a rally started in mid-January when August hit a low of $295.00.</p>
<p>But with the lack of movement in New York, hoped for by London traders to inspire more activity on the whites, London failed to kick into life, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;London is very quiet and there's not a great deal of interest,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people are still a little surprised the market is holding so well in New York but London is going to be well supported down to $320,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The spot weakness caused August/October to narrow slightly from the $10 seen in earlier trading and little interest was reported on the July/August arbitrage.</p>
<p>At 1510 GMT August was down 90 cents at $325.10 and October down 40 cents at $315.60. Volume was 541 lots.</p>
<p>Technical analysts pegged August support at $325, followed by trendline support at around $323. On the upside, prices were expected to target $331 and thence $341, they said.</p>
<p>Results are still awaited in Bangladesh's tender to buy 25,000 tonnes of white sugar for shipment by August 8. Bidding took place on June 8.</p>
<p>In Paris just 144 lots of the two nearby months changed hands. August was down $1.00 at $325.00 and October down 70 cents at $315.50.</p>
