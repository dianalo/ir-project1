<p>Police made a new arrest on Monday in the investigation into the 1991 murder of Belgian socialist politician Andre Cools, Belga news agency said.</p>
<p>Belga said the Liege judiciary had accused 35-year old Jachino Contrino of having shadowed Cools before the assasination and of having reconnoitred the area of the killing.</p>
<p>Police officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Six people, including former government minister Alain Van der Biest and his one-time private secretary Richard Taxquet, have been arrested in Belgium in the past two months in connection with the Cools killing.</p>
<p>Van der Biest denies any involvement in the killing.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Tunisian police arrested two Tunisian hitmen suspected of having gunned down Cools.</p>
<p>Belga said the two Tunisians had given information about Contrino to the Tunesian judiciary, which had passed it on to the Liege judiciary.</p>
