<p>A South Korean court on Monday issued an arrest warrant on graft charges for a former intelligence official close to the disgraced son of president Kim Young-sam.</p>
<p>Kim Ki-sup will be charged with taking 150 million won ($168,000) in kickbacks and influence-peddling, a court official said.</p>
<p>State prosecutors had sought the warrant on Sunday. They accuse Kim of accepting the money from a former top executive of Daeho Construction Co in return for help obtaining a lucrative cable television licence.</p>
<p>The president's second son, Kim Hyun-chul, who was arrested and held in detention on Saturday, was also charged with taking bribes from the businessman, Lee Sung-ho.</p>
<p>Kim Ki-sup was a manager at a luxury Seoul hotel before becoming deputy director of the Agency for National Security Planning after President Kim took power. He had been a loyal supporter of Kim Young-sam.</p>
<p>Kim Ki-sup resigned from the spy agency as a corruption scandal unfolded following the collapse in January of Hanbo Steel Co under a mountain of debt acquired through string-pulling and bribery.</p>
<p>Kim Ki-sup is being held at prosecution offices in Seoul, where he has maintained his innocence during marathon questioning sessions.</p>
<p>Opposition parties accused him of leaking sensitive intelligence data to the president's son to help the younger Kim extend his own power base.</p>
<p>Most dramatically, they accused him of managing around seven billion won of unspent funds from president Kim's 1992 election campaign at the request of Kim Hyun-chul, who helped engineer his father's victory.</p>
<p>Alleged political slush funds have become a burning political issue in South Korea, and President Kim is under growing pressure to give a full public account of his campaign financing.</p>
<p>The president, whose image as a graft-fighter has been shattered by the Hanbo loans-for-kickbacks scandal, is expected to make an announcement on the subject on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Separately, prosecutors on Monday are expected to demand sentences for 11 people on trial for bribery in connection with the failure of Hanbo Steel, the biggest corporate casualty in South Korean history.</p>
<p>Among the 11 are three close aides of the president, bankers and the founder of the Hanbo Group, Chung Tae-woo.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians allege the Hanbo affair is at the root of a political scandal connected to the funding of President Kim's election.</p>
<p>They allege the campaign was partly financed by a 90 billion won gift from the Hanbo chairman, and that loans of around five trillion won to his steelmaking flagship were to repay the favour.</p>
<p>State prosecutors were unable to establish any direct involvement by Kim Hyun-chul in the Hanbo scandal.</p>
<p>Instead, they charged him with accepting bribes of 3.2 billion won from unrelated businesses, and with failing to pay tax on 3.3 billion won in gifts. He faces a maximum sentence of life in jail for tax evasion, and five years for bribery. ($1=891 won)</p>
