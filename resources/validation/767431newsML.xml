<p>The Philippine central bank said on Wednesday it cut the overnight borrowing rate to 20 percent from 22 percent.  </p>
<p>This is fourth cut in the central bank's closely-watched rate since the peso was devalued over two weeks ago when it was at a 2-1/2 year high of 32 percent.</p>
<p>The central bank also said its Monetary Board decided to raise further the liquidity reserve to four percent from three percent effective Thursday.</p>
<p>Early this week, it lifted the liquidity reserve to three percent from two percent in a move to siphon excess money in the system that might have been used for peso speculation.</p>
<p>The liquidity reserve is that portion of the reserve requirement that would have to be placed in short-term, market-yielding securities issued by the central bank.</p>
<p>The central bank said in a statement the increase in liquidity reserves would reduce liquidity by a total of 21.2 billion pesos since it would be applied across-the-board to all peso deposits, deposit substitutes, common trust funds and other trust funds.</p>
<p>The central bank had been imposing changes in regulations over the past two weeks to stabilise the currency situation after the peso had been hit by regional speculation caused by the Thai baht's problems.</p>
<p>The cut in its overnight rate is aimed at encouraging banks to lower their lending rates and normalise lending activities.</p>
