<title>INDONESIA: Indonesian rupiah up on exchange rate reports.</title>
<headline>Indonesian rupiah up on exchange rate reports.</headline>

<p>Indonesia's rupiah strengthened against the dollar in hectic late trading on Friday following a statement by the central bank governor that he did not believe in using exchange rates to boost exports, dealers said.</p>
<p>Sudradjad Djiwandono told an economic conference on Friday he was not a true believer in using the exchange rate as a tool to boost export competitiveness.</p>
<p>One U.S. bank dealer said the statement triggered offshore dollar unloading and sent spot rupiah up to a high of 2,332.50 before it fell again on central bank fixing.  </p>
<p>Dealers said a surprise move by the central bank to raise its fixing by another point sparked off dollar buying but it failed to maintain the gain it made due to foreign pressure.</p>
<p>The central bank raised its intervention band to 2,333/2525 and the conversion rate to 2333/2381.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was last at 2,333.50/34.00 at 0900 GMT against an opening of 2332.50/33.50. Today closed at 2,333.00/33.50. Overnight swap was at 0.9 points.</p>
<p>Spot/next was at 0.4/0.5 points. Overnight money was last quoted at 8.25 percent on the back of ample liquidity.  </p>
<p>Dealers said it was stable at that level because of a central bank offer of overnight papers (SBIs) at eight percent.</p>
<p>The market has experienced a rare four-point depreciation of the rupiah by the central bank this week after a weekly three-point hike in the past three weeks.</p>
<p>The U.S. bank dealer said operators were a bit surprised by the governor's statement and the depreciation policy.</p>
<p>&quot;But it seems that people are putting more weight on the exchange rate statement as reflected by the renewed dollar selling after a brief uptrend,&quot; the dealer said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's been a volatile day. Sentiment now seems to favour the rupiah despite flush supply,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the money market was surprisingly ample one day after the end of Bank Negara Indonesia's share offering.</p>
<p>But they said early central bank injection of more than one trillion rupiah seemed to aid the condition.</p>
<p>Dealers said swap rates fluctuated following the governor's statement, but they remained on a softer tone.</p>
<p>One-month swap was at 15.50/16.50, two at 32.0/33.0, three at 48.0/50.0 and six at 94.50/96.0 points.</p>
