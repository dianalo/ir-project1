<p>Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the European Commission on Tuesday:</p>
<p>Spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas said Commissioner Mario Monti would hold a news conference on citizens in Europe at 1215/1015 GMT on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Van der Pas said the Commission would meet on Thursday instead of Wednesday due to the EU/U.S. summit that will take place on Wednesday in The Hague.</p>
<p>Van der Pas said Commissioners Martin Bangemann and Neil Kinnock would hold news conferences on Thursday, respectively at 1200/1000 GMT and 1230/1030 GMT.</p>
<p>Van der Pas said Thursday's Midday Briefing would therefore be at 1145/0945 GMT instead of 1200/1000 GMT.</p>
<p>Spokesman Filippo di Robilant briefed on the Commission Eurobarometer survey on the way European citizens perceive European and national consumer policies. He said the poll showed that citizens largely approved the EU consumer policy and called on the Union for further action. Di Robilant also said that food safety was EU consumers' first concern, followed by medecines, and that financial services was the sector were consumers felt the most uneasy.</p>
<p>Van der Pas briefed on Wednesday's EU/U.S. summit. He said a customs cooperation agreement and agreement on chemical precursors would be signed. He also said the Commission hoped that the mutual recognition agreement currently under negotiation in Paris would be ready for signature in The Hague.</p>
<p>Van der Pas said Commission President Jacques Santer, U.S. President Bill Clinton and Dutch Prime Minisiter Wim Kok would also discuss China's accession to the World Trade Organisation and the situation in the Middle East, the Balkans and Turkey.</p>
<p>In answer to a question, spokesman Joao Vale de Almeida said the Commission had not taken a decision on duties to be applied to Norvegian salmon. He said the procedure would be over by the end of the week.</p>
