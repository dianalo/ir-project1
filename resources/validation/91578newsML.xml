<p>Afghan fighters wearing a motley array of ex-Soviet army surplus, long shirts and turbans blew on their hands as freezing cloud poured down off the peaks of the Hindu Kush mountains on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Members of Afghan warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum's Jumbash faction, the fighters were guarding a road tunnel on the strategically vital salang highway.</p>
<p>Dostum's men and armour moved onto the pass to forestall an advance northwards by the radical Islamic Taleban militia which seized the capital Kabul last week.</p>
<p>The tunnel, 70 km (45 miles) northwest of Kabul and abandoned by deposed President Burhanuddin Rabbani's forces last week, forms a vital link between the capital, northern Afghanistan and the Central Asian republics beyond.</p>
<p>The mountainside bristled with Jumbash weaponry. Howitzers, mortars and tanks were dug in around the tunnel and the surrounding heights, over 3,000 meters (yards) above sea level.</p>
<p>A Grad multiple rocket launcher had its barrels trained down the valley, with rice fields and mulberry trees visible in the distance.</p>
<p>&quot;The Taleban are down there,&quot; said the frontline commander, Colonel-General Chary, in a long corduory shirt and hefty turban to keep out the cold, his outstretched hand following the line of the rocket launcher.</p>
<p>&quot;We command the heights -- there has been no fighting here,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dostum's Jumbash faction, or the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, has said it does not want to fight the Taleban.</p>
<p>But the armour guarding the spectacular natural gate to Dostum's northern territory gave a clear message.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to fight but we will defend ourselves,' the front commander said.</p>
<p>The Taleban's lightning advance northwards, bringing with it its fundamentalist brand of Islam, sent shivers through the relatively liberal northern territories controlled by Dostum.</p>
<p>But the charred, wrecked tanks littering the Salang highway, remnants of the ill-fated Soviet intervention from 1979-1989 and later inter-faction fighting, are an awesome reminder of the cost of taking the road.</p>
<p>The snows, due soon, will make an advance across the pass extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Winter jackets were handed round to Dostum's men, some without socks, in anticipation.</p>
<p>&quot;So far the Taleban have taken towns without any serious fighting,&quot; said a western aid worker based in the region.</p>
<p>He questioned the militia's ability to scrap with Dostum's well-armed and well-disciplined forces.</p>
<p>Buses and trucks full of refugees, piled high with bags and bicycles, teetered over the pass away from Kabul to find sanctuary in Dostum's lands.</p>
<p>Colonel Sayed Ahmed, a bearded Afghan commander at the front -- Jumbash fighters sport only moustaches -- said he had abandoned Rabbani's army and joined the Jumbash to hold back the Taleban. &quot;The Taleban are bad people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A truck load of Rabbani's soldiers drew up behind the colonel's jeep, also intent on changing sides.</p>
<p>But despite diverse protestations of support for Dostum, including that of Russian security tsar and Afghan veteran Alexander Lebed, the wily general cannot rest easy.</p>
<p>There is widespread talk of more war.</p>
<p>&quot;The Taleban want all Afghanistan,&quot; said another aid worker who declined to be named.</p>
