<p>U.S. Treasuries withstood some late-session selling pressure and ended moderately higher on Thursday, as another round of weak economic reports prompted the market's second rally in three days.</p>
<p>Late Thursday, the 30-year bond was at 94-17/32, up 12/32 from Wednesday, while its yield fell to 7.07 percent from 7.10 percent.</p>
<p>Early in the session, the bond's yield had dropped to 7.05 percent -- its lowest level since March 26 -- but attempts to rally further failed, prompting selling late in the day.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market was ripe for a short-covering bounce and today's (economic) numbers provided it,&quot; said Marcello Frustaci, senior trader at Daiwa Securities America Inc.</p>
<p>The market was initially boosted by an 8,000 rise in jobless claims to a 332,000 level in the week ended April 12. Economists had expected a 317,000 level and the market got more than what it bargained for when the prior week's claims figures were revised to 324,000 from 318,000.</p>
<p>A short time later the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia reported that most of the components in its Business Outlook Survey fell in April.  </p>
<p>The overall business activity index dove to 5.7 in April from 21.1 in March. Indexes for new orders, shipments, unfulfilled orders, delivery times, inventories and employment also fell. Only the price indexes rose, but the market chose to focus on the report as a whole.</p>
<p>As such, dealers covered short positions for the third straight session. Traders also reported hedge fund buying and rumored Fed buying of two- and five-year notes.</p>
<p>With the market in poor shape last week, dealers created short positions, and have been forced to cover them as weak data this week improved sentiment and prompted buying.  </p>
<p>One senior trader at a large U.S. bank/dealer said that people lost a lot of money trading short this week, and those who were short are now &quot;flat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, people don't have a strong conviction on the marketplace,&quot; he said, adding that many dealers plan to sit on the sidelines for the time being.</p>
<p>The morning rally sent Treasuries to highs not seen since a day after the Fed raised interest rates, and players said that if the rallies keep up, the bond could test the 7.0 percent level before long.  </p>
<p>&quot;What the market is doing is living with the legacy of the (weak) CPI report, which gave a ... forum for the bulls to step back in,&quot; said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. &quot;The numbers are not being viewed as challenging. It's not a bullish attitude, but it's not as outright negative as it was on Friday&quot; after a strong producer price report sent yields soaring.</p>
<p>&quot;There's only so far the market can go,&quot; Flanagan said, adding that the bond should trade in a 7.0 to 7.20 percent range until the last week of April.  </p>
<p>The bout of euphoria in the market ended in the afternoon, after attempts to push the June bond contact through its high of 108-7/32 failed.</p>
<p>Aiding the market's descent were hawkish remarks from Kansas City Fed president Thomas Hoenig. Hoenig, not a Fed Board voting member, said the U.S. economy continues to grow at a solid pace, with tight labor markets, strong consumer demand, moderate inflation but price pressure risks are &quot;on the upside.&quot;</p>
<p>Those remarks shaved about 10/32 off the long bond's session highs.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the market shrugged off the Commerce Department's report that the U.S. trade gap narrowed to $11.59 billion in February from a revised $12.67 billion in January. Late in the session, the trade deficit was revised from $11.59 billion to $10.4 billion due to a miscalculation in crude oil imports.</p>
<p>With all the key data out of the way for about another two weeks, players said the market is stuck.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be boring for a while,&quot; said Greg Jones, chief economist at Briefing.com, noting that the Employment Cost Index (ECI) for the first quarter is the next key focus.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's not a long term bullish trade,&quot; Jones said. &quot;We won't see bad news for a week and a half so it brings people back in for the intermediate term.&quot;</p>
<p>The two-year note was at 99-22/32, up 2/32, with its yield falling to 6.42 percent from 6.46 percent. The three-year note closed up 4/32 at 98-7/32, yielding 6.57 percent. The five-year note traded up 5/32 at 99-17/32 to yield 6.74 percent. And, the 10-year note was at 95-25/32 to yield 6.85 percent.</p>
<p>Bill rates were flat to down three basis points, but underperformed the rest of the market on rumored Asian Central Bank selling.</p>
