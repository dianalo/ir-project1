<title>NETHERLANDS: ANALYSTS CUT HEINEKEN 1996 FORECASTS.</title>
<headline>ANALYSTS CUT HEINEKEN 1996 FORECASTS.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-09-13</dateline>

<p>News on Friday that Heineken NV anticipated 1996 profits would be below 1995's caused share analysts to lower their own estimates for 1996, singling out competition in Europe as the brewer's biggest headache.</p>
<p>Marius Andre, analyst at Amstgeld, said he would be cutting his full year 1996 net profit forecast to 650 million guilders from 750 million, versus the 1995 result of 664 million.</p>
<p>The brewer said earlier it expected 1996 full year net profit to be somewhat lower than 1995's. This, along with news of lower than expected first half net profit sent the shares lurching 36.70 guilders or 10.12 percent lower to 327.00.    </p>
<p>Another analyst, who declined to be named, said he would be cutting his own forecast for the year, but said he wanted to attend Heineken's analysts' meeting before giving details. &quot;We want to see the details behind their profit warning,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts said Heineken's problems could be fairly shortlived and this year could be a hiccup in the brewer's progress.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not an underlying problem, there's a couple of factors played out this year...weather, consolidation of low margin or loss making acquisitions, a bit of a currency impact, the financial costs associated with acquisitions,&quot; said MeesPierson analyst Darrell Duthie.    </p>
<p>&quot;I think you can expect a resumption of growth. This year (1996) will be a low comparison year,&quot; said Duthie, adding sales in the U.S. and Asia Pacific were strong.</p>
<p>&quot;The real hiccup for Heineken is in Europe and there it's clear that the overall market is shrinking and already fierce competition is getting worse, putting pressure on margins,&quot; said Amstgeld's Andre.</p>
<p>&quot;That of course is a big problem because that's where by far most of the business is generated,&quot; said Andre. &quot;It's clear the double digit growth pattern we've seen in the last years will be damaged a bit at least this year and the coming year,&quot; he said.</p>
