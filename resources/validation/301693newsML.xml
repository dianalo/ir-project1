<p>With the threat of environmental nightmares no stranger to the oil industry, private and international insurance is in place to pay for cleaning up the tonnes of oil now hitting Japan's northern coast.</p>
<p>But for residents, it may be years before they receive any compensation for the potential ruin of their traditional way of life, experts say.</p>
<p>While clean-up costs have not yet been calculated in what is one of the world's most expensive places to do business, the Russian owners of the 13,157-tonne tonne tanker, Nakhodka, said there is $500 million available.</p>
<p>The ship was carrying 19,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil when it broke in half in the Sea of Japan on January 2.</p>
<p>Under an international agreement forged in 1969, the owner of a ship is primarily responsible for damages caused by an oil spill.</p>
<p>The code provides for maximum liability of a 10,000-tonne tanker at about 200 million yen ($1.73 million). If damage claims exceed that amount, a fund established by governments will cover the difference.</p>
<p>The maximum liability of the tanker owner and the international fund combined is about 22 billion yen ($191 million), the industry organisation of oil companies and trading houses said.</p>
<p>The UK P&amp;I Club, the insurer of Nakhodka, said last week it provided Protection and Indemnity insurance for the tanker. The total coverage is $500 million, with liability spread out among a number of firms through a process known as reinsurance.</p>
<p>But while the money is available, local residents such as fisherman who fear their livelihood will disappear may have to wait years before receiving any compensation.</p>
<p>&quot;It has taken one and a half year to three years to settle similar tanker accidents in the past,&quot; A Fishery Federation spokesman said.</p>
<p>The insurer's representative in Tokyo said that with the cleanup still underway, it was too soon to say when the claims would eventually be settled.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know how long it will take to settle the damage claims,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The previous worst oil spill in Japan took place in 1971, when 7,200 tonnes (50,400 barrels) of oil were spilled from a tanker that ran around the port city of Niigata.</p>
<p>Its damage claims, including reparations to the local fishing industry and the cost of the clean-up, amounted to 560 million yen ($4.86 million).</p>
<p>The accident has also raised the question of whether Japan, a major oil importer, should have tougher regulations.</p>
<p>Following the massive Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska, the United States requires tankers to carry documents guaranteeing that their owners can pay for cleanup operations.</p>
<p>But Japanese officials say that the issue should be dealt with at an international level.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't make much sense to work unilaterally for the safety of tanker operations as they (oil tankers) sail all around the world no matter which country they belong to,&quot; a transport ministry official said.</p>
