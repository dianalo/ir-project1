<p>Yugoslavia's business climate deteriorated in March and industry is mixed on the immediate outlook, according to a poll conducted by a Belgrade-based economic think-tank.</p>
<p>&quot;Only a negligible 0.2 percent of firms polled believe the present overall economic situation is good while 64.1 percent think it is bad,&quot; Goran Pitic, a prominent economist with the Economics Institute, said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The institute provided no figures for other answers. It conducts monthly polls of 300 Yugoslav firms covering 55 percent of all industry.</p>
<p>On the short-term outlook, 22.2 percent of those polled saw the situation improving and 18.1 percent said it would worsen, the report said.</p>
<p>Optimism on production activity was low, with 17.4 percent of polled companies reporting growth in March, while 15.6 percent said their output had dropped.</p>
<p>The firms cited lack of credits, low demand and shortage of imports as major factors inhibiting growth.</p>
<p>Lack of demand is a problem for many firms, with only  30.5 percent envisaging increased domestic sales in the second quarter.</p>
