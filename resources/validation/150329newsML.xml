<p>THE DOMINION</p>
<p>The Government ordered its electronic communications agency to sweep one of Parliament's meeting rooms for bugs on Tuesday in an attempt to preserve the tight secrecy surrounding coalition talks. The sweep took place before a meeting between NZ First and the Labour Party. NZ First leader Winston Peters and Labour leader Helen Clark emerged from the talks refusing to comment on what topics had been discussed. Peters said talks with Labour and National were running parallel. He said the pace of talks was &quot;picking up&quot; and that &quot;substantial progress&quot; had been made in the talks with Labour. The talks on Tuesday were  </p>
<p>understood to have touched on broad economic questions and on employment. Page 1.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Jim Bolger's leadership of the National Party is to come up for review at the party's annual caucus retreat expected to be in February 1997. A failure to return National to office after negotiations with NZ First would be expected to spell the end of Bolger's prospects of leading the party into the next election. Page 2.</p>

<p>Members of Parliament on Tuesday rejected a proposal to crack down on the hardest elements of the sex industry after the recent killings of three people in Auckland's red light district. However, some said they would support decriminalising soliciting. Page 2.</p>

<p>Four more banks joined the rush to lower mortgage interest rates on Tuesday, with Bank of New Zealand setting a new benchmark for the big lenders by dropping its rates by one percentage point.  Bank of New Zealand announced it would cut its floating interest rates for home finance on December 2 to  </p>
<p>10.5 percent from 11.5 percent. HongkongBank and Countrywide Bank also cut their floating rates on Tuesday - HongKongBank to 10.5 percent and Countrywide to 10.75 percent. Taranaki-based TSB Bank said it had reduced its mortgage rates - and would offer an 8.9 percent rate for some one-year fixed-rate loans. Page 13.</p>

<p>Fletcher Challenge Energy's oil, gas and condensate production for the September quarter was equal to 12.5 million barrels of oil, up 11 percent on the same three months last year. While production was up, the company's exploration picture  </p>
<p>was mixed, with the offshore Taranaki Awatea-1 well plugged and abandoned earlier this month. Data from the Maharaja-Lela 3 appraisal well in Brunei was still to be assessed. Page 13.</p>

<p>The world's biggest bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, has opened a branch in Auckland. It is the first Japanese bank to open a branch in New Zealand. As well as providing bank services for existing Japanese clients with operations in New Zealand, the bank intends to go after big New Zealand companies. Page 13.</p>

<p>Broadway Industries advised shareholders on Tuesday not to sell their shares. The company said it would make another announcement early next week. The company in September reported an after-tax profit of $127,000 for the June 30 year after abnormal costs of $1.38 million. The result contrasted with a $1.52 million profit in the previous year.

<p>Higher returns on domestic assets had enabled all New Zealand's super fund operators to report positive returns for the September quarter, Mercer Investment Consulting said on Tuesday. The Mercer survey of 15 fund operators found the median  </p>
<p>return before tax and expenses was 3.7 percent, compared with 0.6 percent in the June quarter. Page 17.</p>

<p>Statistics New Zealand is laying the groundwork for a five-yearly review of the consumers price index, a process which will probably result in a debate about the index's influence on monetary policy. Page 18.</p>
<p>THE NEW ZEALAND HERALD  </p>
<p>The anti-bugging sweep on Tuesday of the room used for coalition negotiations was ordered by the Prime Minister's Department. A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said it was &quot;a routine matter&quot; to sweep sensitive locations in the parliamentary complex. Meanwhile, the New Zealand Herald understood the approach New Zealand First is taking to the talks is to ask both Labour and National to go through its manifesto and identify which policies they can agree to and which they cannot.</p>

<p>The Bank of New Zealand and the HongKongBank lead the latest round of mortgage cuts by dropping floating rates to 10.5 percent.</p>

<p>New Zealand's prime position as the first financial market to open each day has proved a strong attraction to the world's largest bank. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi became the 17th registered bank in New Zealand on Tuesday when it opened its Auckland branch.</p>

<p>The New Zealand Futures and Options Exchange is keen to develop new products based on the electricity market if demand warrants it, the exchange chief Peter Mansell said on Tuesday. The exchange has announced it would launch monthly electricity futures contracts in November.  </p>
