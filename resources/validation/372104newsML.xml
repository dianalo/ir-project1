<title>RUSSIA: Kremlin says NATO has covert &quot;anti-Moscow&quot; policy.</title>
<headline>Kremlin says NATO has covert &quot;anti-Moscow&quot; policy.</headline>

<p>The Kremlin accused NATO and its Secretary-General Javier Solana on Wednesday of pursuing a covert anti-Moscow policy, Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>The comments, by President Boris Yeltsin's press secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, took Moscow's opposition to the Western alliance's plans to expand eastwards to a new level of ferocity.</p>
<p>In Brussels, NATO officials denied the Russian charges.</p>
<p>&quot;NATO does not regard at all the relationship between these countries and NATO and the relationship between these countries and Russia as mutually exclusive,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>&quot;One does not exclude the other,&quot; the source added.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky singled out a tour Solana is making of former Soviet republics for attack. He said Moscow, which is seeking closer integration with the newly independent states, believed Solana had &quot;an undeclared, behind-the-scenes&quot; aim.</p>
<p>&quot;The West as a whole, and the leadership of NATO in particular, is opposed to any form of integration between the newly independent states -- the republics of the former USSR,&quot; Interfax quoted Yastrzhembsky as saying.</p>
<p>Interfax added: &quot;Having called such a line an anti-Moscow one, the press secretary noted that it was perceived by Russia 'no doubt without sympathy, but with concern'.&quot;</p>
<p>Solana has been touring former Soviet republics this week to explain NATO's enlargement plans.</p>
<p>His trip has angered the Kremlin, which apparently regards it as a NATO challenge to Russia's hopes of developing ties in the region -- one of Moscow's most important foreign policy goals.</p>
<p>Russia and NATO are locked in an increasingly bitter row over the alliance's plans to offer membership to some former Warsaw Pact states.</p>
<p>Russia says this would jeopardise its security and weaken Yeltsin's position. Officials in the Kremlin and the government have hit out against the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's plans in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no grounds to say that the positions have started to become closer,&quot; Yastrzhembsky said, adding that the &quot;ball is in NATO's court&quot;.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky reiterated Moscow's support for a proposal by French President Jacques Chirac to discuss Russia's concerns at a meeting of the leaders of Russia, France, Britain the United States and Germany. Washington has responded coolly to the idea.</p>
