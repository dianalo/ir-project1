<p>Beijing will not hurt Hong Kong and hopes the British territory will not harm the motherland after it reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen has said.</p>
<p>&quot;The central government's policies will not infringe upon the interests of Hong Kong,&quot; Qian said in a speech, the full text of which was published by the official People's Daily on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We also hope things will not emerge in Hong Kong that will infringe upon Hong Kong's and the national interests,&quot; said Qian, who is also a vice-premier.</p>
<p>He did not say what actions China would consider as infringing on its interests or how Beijing would react in such an event.</p>
<p>The vice-premier also urged Hong Kong democrats to stop criticising Beijing. &quot;We do not ask them to approve of China's socialist system. We only ask them to love the motherland, to love Hong Kong,&quot; Qian said.</p>
<p>Qian tried to allay fears that Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, would be worse off after the handover.</p>
<p>He reiterated Beijing's pledges that Hong Kong people will rule Hong Kong and that the territory's capitalist lifestyle would not change for 50 years under the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; formula designed by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>Qian said the use of the 50-year schedule was figurative in meaning rather than literal. &quot;The meaning of 'will not change for 50 years' is no change for a long period of time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's confidence in that pledge was dented after June 4, 1989 when Chinese soldiers backed by tanks crushed student-led demonstrations for democracy centred at Beijing's Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds.</p>
<p>About 55,000 people poured into a Hong Kong park for a candlelight vigil on the eighth anniversary of the crackdown on June 4 this year to mourn Tiananmen victims, ignoring a plea from the territory's future leader Tung Chee-hwa to forget the tragedy in the interests of a &quot;smooth transition&quot;.</p>
<p>Qian said the world would be watching Hong Kong in the post-colonial era and China was eager for the territory to succeed under its sovereignty.</p>
<p>&quot;A formidable task lies in front of us and it is also a new challenge. Let us unite around the (Communist) Party Central Committee with comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and work hard to usher in this solemn historic moment,&quot; Qian said.</p>
<p>Jiang, Communist Party chief and state president, will attend celebrations in Hong Kong marking the handover.</p>
<p>&quot;For more than a century after the 'opium wars', foreigners looked down on Chinese,&quot; Qian said in reference to China's defeat in the 19th-century wars, which forced China to cede Hong Kong to Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;They did not believe Chinese had the ability to run Hong Kong well. This was the attitude left by old colonialists,&quot; the vice-premier told a seminar on the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; formula concocted by the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>Qian said the formula would allow peaceful reunification with rival Taiwan without altering China's socialist or Hong Kong's capitalist and democratic lifestyles.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it socialism gobbling up Taiwan or is it Taiwan ... gobbling up the mainland? It is not good for anybody to gobble up anybody,&quot; Qian quoted Deng as saying.</p>
