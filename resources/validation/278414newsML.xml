<p>France said on Friday it was withdrawing from a five-year-old allied air reconnaissance operation aimed at safeguarding Kurdish civilians in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry said France would no longer participate in &quot;Operation Provide Comfort&quot; after the end of the year because changes in the mission had eliminated its humanitarian aspects.</p>
<p>The move did not affect French participation in a similar air watch over southern Iraq with U.S. and British aircraft, the ministry said.</p>
<p>France has participated in the operation in northern Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War in cooperation with the United States, Turkey and Britain .</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anita Limido said the main goal of the operation had until now been to assure the safety of humanitarian flights by private aid groups into northern Iraq.</p>
<p>This would no longer be necessary because a United Nations food-for-oil pact required that 30 percent of all aid destined for Iraq be earmarked for Kurdish areas, Limido said.</p>
<p>&quot;The new operation is essentially one of air surveillance,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The White House had said on Wednesday it was confident Paris would continue to take part in the operation, aimed at barring Iraqi flights over the predominantly Kurdish zone.</p>
<p>But Limido predicted the decision would have no impact on France's &quot;excellent&quot; relations with Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;Though we have always had our differences, Franco-American relations have long been characterised by a spirit of dialogue and compromise,&quot; she told reporters. &quot;We have always found ourselves on the same side when important issues were at stake.&quot;</p>
<p>An official Iraqi newspaper, anticipating the French decision, wrote on Friday: &quot;The French move would enhance ties...with Iraq, not only on the political level, but by boosting comprehensive relations that both sides are willing to bring back to their past (pre-Gulf War) level.</p>
<p>&quot;The French move would lead the world to emphasise the fact that the activities of the &quot;Hammer Force' are illegal,&quot; said al-Thawra, organ of the ruling Baath party.</p>
<p>France, eager to help exploit Iraqi oil resources, has courted Baghdad and pressed for an end to U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The French withdrawal from the air operation added to a list of disagreements between Paris and Washington which have led to sharp exchanges between officials of the two countries.</p>
<p>France and the United States have sparred this month over the U.S. command of NATO forces in southern Europe, French objections to Kofi Annan as new U.N. secretary-general and a perceived diplomatic snub of outgoing Secretary of State Warren Christopher by his French counterpart Herve de Charette.</p>
<p>Allied aircraft have been shielding Iraq's ethnic Kurds from Iraqi aircraft north of the 36th parallel since a failed Kurdish uprising at the end of the Gulf War. The operation has been based at Incerlik Air Base in Turkey.</p>
<p>France has about half a dozen planes in the mission.</p>
<p>It temporarily halted its flights in September after the United States fired 44 cruise missiles against targets in the south of Iraq to punish President Saddam Hussein for moving ground troops into a Kurdish enclave north of the 36th parallel.</p>
