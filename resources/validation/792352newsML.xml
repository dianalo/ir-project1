<title>JAPAN: JGBS END TOKYO EASIER DESPITE TUMBLE IN STOCKS.</title>

<p>The key September 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) futures contract closed slightly easier on Monday, as the topside was capped amid a lack of investor buying.</p>
<p>The JGB market failed to react to the key stock index's loss of nearly four percent because investors were mostly absent due to the summer holidays, traders said.</p>
<p>Earlier this morning, dealers bought JGBs on hopes a new rally may start with funds shifting from Tokyo stocks after Friday's sell-off on Wall Street, but these longs were later squared, they said. The September finished down 0.02 at 126.61.  </p>
<p>Turnover was 28,644 contracts.</p>
<p>The September rose as high as 126.87 soon after the opening on the expectation that weak stocks would boost JGBs. But its failure to reach a recent high of 126.91 prompted long-liquidation by dealers, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Without speculative buying from dealers in early trade, the market could have risen further when the Nikkei index actually fell in the afternoon,&quot; said a dealer at a city bank's securities unit.</p>
<p>&quot;But because of the early rally, it was difficult (for the September) to rise beyond its morning high,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 plunged 780.28 points or 3.98 percent to close at 18,824.18, racking up its largest point loss for calendar 1997. It was the lowest close since April 28, when the key stock index closed at 18,670.37.</p>
<p>&quot;JGBs were unable to react to sharp falls in the Nikkei today because many people were still afraid of an overbought market,&quot; said a dealer at another city bank's securities unit.</p>
<p>&quot;The best scenario would be that the yield of the key 182nd 10-year bond were to fall below two percent only for a brief period,&quot; he said. The yield of the 182nd issue stood at 2.105 percent at 0656 GMT, unchanged from Friday's close.  </p>
<p>The yield hit a record low of 2.070 percent on August 4.</p>
<p>Market participants had mixed views about the effect further weakness in Tokyo share prices would have on the bond market.</p>
<p>Some said JGBs would remain underpinned by weakness in stocks, but others said that a further significant fall in share prices may have a negative effect on bond prices.</p>
<p>&quot;JGBs couldn't take advantage of the Nikkei's fall. That was probably because of a view that if share prices kept on falling, investors may have no choice but to secure profits by selling bonds,&quot; a trust bank dealer said.  </p>
<p>Traders said it would take a while before investors got used to the current long-term bond yields which were hovering near record lows.</p>
<p>The current firmness in JGBs started since late July when key data showed a worsening of the economy.</p>
<p>The first dealer said: &quot;I would say operators need an excuse to buy further. They want to see for the next couple of days whether the Dow industrials falls further or not.&quot;</p>
