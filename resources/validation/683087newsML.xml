<p>Switzerland, under fire for aiding Germany during the Second World War, also provided banking services and shipped war materials to Japan, according to U.S. intelligence documents made public on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The documents, found by the World Jewish Congress in the U.S. National Archives, criticise Switzerland for shipping goods to Japan, providing banking services and sending Tokyo automotive parts and machine tools.</p>
<p>WJC Vice President Kalman Sultanik said, &quot;We have heard in recent weeks how the Swiss had to deal with the Germans during the war because the country was surrounded by Nazi Germany. But I don't recall that they were also surrounded by Imperial Japan. These documents cut to the heart of Swiss neutrality.&quot;</p>
<p>One 1945 document said a list of Swiss banking transactions, including with Japan, showed the extent of damage done to the Allied war effort and charged that Swiss banks, motivated &quot;solely by the profit motive,&quot; had gone beyond what should have been expected of a neutral.</p>
<p>The document added that Swiss banks had allowed Japan and Germany to finance the purchase of critical war material.</p>
<p>A recent U.S. government report charged that Swiss financial dealings with Germany prolonged the war, a charge that the Swiss have hotly denied.</p>
<p>A secret June 1942 U.S. intelligence document alleged that &quot;Up to now 35,000 tons of war materials have been shipped from Germany and Switzerland to Japan via Thailand -- the ships sailing ostensibly under Spanish registry around Cape Horn and refueling at Portugese Guinea, Rio de Janeiro, etc. -- in return for rubber and rice.&quot;</p>
<p>Another 1942 document reported that before Pearl Harbour orders were placed by 20 Japanese firms with 15 Swiss companies for automotive parts and machine tools. The documents said work continued on the order after U.S. entry into the war and 11 out of 70 machines had been assembled.</p>
<p>Another document reported that in October 1944 there were substantial dealings between the Swiss central bank and a Tokyo bank.</p>
<p>A 1945 document from the U.S. government's Foreign Economic Administration cited those bank dealings as an example of Swiss aid to the enemy that &quot;clearly went beyond the obligations under which a neutral must continue trade with a belligerent.&quot;</p>
