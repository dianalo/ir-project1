<p>The chairman of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Vincent Casella, resigned on Wednesday after an internal probe into his ties with a firm hired to implement an electronic trading system.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Casella offered to submit his resignation to the PHLX (exchange) Board of Governors,&quot; the exchange said in a statement after a board meeting about the investigation.</p>
<p>At the meeting, the board heard the report by a special committee formed to investigate whether Casella improperly benefited from his ownership of shares in Ashton Technology Group Inc., which was hired by the exchange to build the trading system.</p>
<p>&quot;The special committee unanimously recommended that the board accept Mr. Casella's offer (to resign) and the board unanimously voted to do so,&quot; the exchange said.</p>
<p>The exchange is an international leader in foreign currency options trading, as well as a market for sector-index options and other financial instruments.</p>
<p>Casella was listed in documents submitted to federal regulators as owner of 152,000 shares in Ashton, through a firm in which he was a principal, shortly before the firm went public in May, 1996.</p>
<p>An Ashton subsidiary, Universal Trading Technologies Corp., received the contract to build the system on the exchange's equity floor. Ashton listed the contract in federal documents as a major source of its business.</p>
<p>Casella had been reported as defending his position in a letter to the board and exchange members by saying his actions were &quot;totally motivated&quot; by the &quot;best interests of the exchange,&quot; and by calling allegations of improper ties politically motivated.</p>
<p>The exchange, in its statement on Wednesday, said it had reaffirmed its commitment to the trading system, which it expected to be deployed in early 1997.</p>
<p>It also said the special committee had recommended increasing the number of public members on its board of governors. Currently there are three members of the public on the 29-member board; the rest are exchange traders.</p>
<p>The exchange named Vice-Chairman John Wallace to serve as chairman until the board's annual election in March 1997.</p>
<p>J. Carter Beese, chairman of the special committee, said in the statement the investigation had taken several months. &quot;We are confident that the exchange has concluded its investigation consistent with the critical importance of its regulatory role, and we look forward to continuing the innovative leadership that the exchange has demonstrated in the capital markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Another board member of the exchange has also been targeted in an unrelated complaint by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over alleged misreporting of securities prices, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported last week.</p>
<p>That board member, Richard Feinberg, has denied the charges and said he would fight them. The trades in question were done on the over-the-counter market and not on the Philadelphia exchange.</p>
