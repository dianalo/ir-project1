<headline>WEEK AHEAD - Tender markets seek solace from Fed.</headline>

<p>Battered financial markets will find solace in steady interest rate policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve in the week ahead but trading tension will remain high, economists said.</p>
<p>Apart from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, there will be annual news conferences at the Bundesbank and Bank of France. Top-flight data will come from Germany and Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;The street is fairly long of bonds and I would expect the negative environment to continue in the run-up to Christmas,&quot; said James McKay, international economist at PaineWebber.</p>
<p>McKay, like many economists, does not expect the FOMC to alter interest rates when it meets on Tuesday, despite last week's comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- still reverberating through shares and bond -- about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in markets.</p>
<p>Steven Brice, currency economist at I.D.E.A in London, said the performance of asset markets will be key for the dollar, with investors worried that Wall Street's downturn will turn into a full-fledged rout.</p>
<p>&quot;Asset market performance is still very important,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There will be little in the way of data from the U.S., although November capacity utilisation and industrial production on Monday and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve survey on Thursday may provide a focus, analysts said.</p>
<p>Industrial production was expected to show a rebound from the 0.5 percent drop in October, said Jim Fralick, economist at Morgan Stanley in London.</p>
<p>In Europe, markets will also be digesting the outcome of the EU summit in Dublin where leaders agreed to a single currency stability pact to enforce budget discipline after planned monetary union in 1999.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank holds its annual news conference after its regular policy meeting on Thursday to reveal its M3 money supply target for next year.</p>
<p>Analysts do not expect it to change much from the four to seven percent target corridor of this year (consistently overshot), though it may switch to a two-year target to reduce volatility.</p>
<p>&quot;A central bank aiming to pass on its monetary targeting genes intact to a European Central Bank successor will scarcely sound anything other than evangelical at the most high profile press conference of its calendar,&quot; PaineWebber said in a note.</p>
<p>November M3 money supply data are also due in the week ahead are again expected to be above the target at around 8.1 percent.</p>
<p>The Ifo survey of German business sentiment set for release on Monday should show improvement above the 97.4 level registered in October, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;All the anecdotal evidence continues to point to a continued pick up in German industrial activity,&quot; PaineWebber's McKay said.</p>
<p>The Bank of France's annual conference on Tuesday will also a provide some interest as it reveals its objectives for 1997.</p>
<p>In Britain, November retail sales and unemployment data will be key as investors look for any signs of inflationary pressure and a reason for monetary authorities to raise rates.</p>
<p>Retail sales are expected to rise 0.5 percent month-on-month and 3.4 percent year-on-year but a bigger increase could come further down the road when Christmas selling is caluculated, analysts said.</p>
<p>Other data of interest include Italian consumer prices from Wednesday and French consumer prices on Friday.</p>
