<p>Dutch banking giant ABN AMRO Holding NV said on Friday it planned to pay $1.95 billion for U.S. savings bank Standard Federal Bancorp Inc in a move seen as reinforcing its international ambitions.</p>
<p>The deal, under which ABN will offer $59 per share, would be the biggest acquisition to date by the Dutch bank, which has been carving a niche outside its home market for many years, particularly in the mid-west region of the United States.</p>
<p>ABN said it would issue $750 million in preference shares to help fund the acquisition of Standard Federal, the largest mid-west savings bank, with the balance funded from existing resources.</p>
<p>Executive board chairman Jan Kalff said he saw little chance of a rival bidder emerging as ABN AMRO had won a private auction after the U.S. bank sought out all interested parties.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a done deal yet but we are confident it will go ahead,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Kalff said it would immediately enhance ABN AMRO's earnings per share and would provide a &quot;beautiful geographic fit&quot; with its LaSalle National Corp banking unit in Illinois state.</p>
<p>&quot;Our critical mass has risen considerably,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Analysts said they believed ABN AMRO should have little difficulty funding the acquisition as it could draw on the estimated two billion guilder ($1.2 billion) proceeds of the previously announced sale of its MeesPierson investment bank.</p>
<p>They sain line with ABN AMRO's policy of expansion in the U.S. and would mesh well with the Dutch banking giant's existing operations.</p>
<p>&quot;It fits in with their strategy of remaining the leading player in (Illinois) and moving into states adjacent to Illinois. It's a good, credible bank with good profitability,&quot; said Heinie Hakker of BZW.</p>
<p>Standard Federal, the fourth largest bank in the state of Michigan, employs some 4,000 staff and has 182 branches in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks good. It's a bank with quite good penetration. The takeover price doesn't seem to be expensive. It's not as expensive as when you buy a bank in Germany and France,&quot; said Daan Worm of ING Barings.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like they have quite a good funding base. The price to book (ratio) is about two times. You pay some goodwill because you pay for the whole operation. Maybe some things could be integrated with (ABN's) Chicago activities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Formed in a 1990 merger, ABN AMRO has grown through acquisitions to be the biggest foreign bank in the United States and a truly global bank with offices in more than 60 countries.</p>
<p>The 1992 purchase of British stockbroker Hoare Govett revealed its ambition to be an integrated commercial and investment bank.</p>
<p>The Dutch bank expects to complete the latest deal by mid-1997, once it has won the approval of Standard Federal's shareholders and supervisory authorities.</p>
<p>It has already reached agreement with the board.</p>
<p>Standard Federal sells mainly savings products and home mortgages to its one million existing clients.</p>
<p>At end-October, it had total assets of $15.5 billion and stockholder equity of around $900 million.</p>
<p>Standard Federal's banks will continue to operate under the Standard Federal name and ABN said there would be &quot;significant cost savings&quot; following the deal.</p>
<p>In Amsterdam, ABN AMRO shares closed 4.40 guilders higher at 109.70 guilders.</p>
<p>($ = 1.685 Dutch Guilders)</p>
