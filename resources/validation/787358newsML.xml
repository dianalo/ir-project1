<p>European low sulphur straight-run prices eased a little on Friday on the back of falling crude futures, traders said.</p>
<p>A refiner offering an end month cargo of 0.5-0.7 percent sulphur material was said to have cut its price early in the day by $1 to $114 fob but a prospective buyer said later that he went down to $112.50/$113.</p>
<p>&quot;This morning he offered me at $113 but I was at $108/$109 and no sellers were at that level,&quot; a trader with the buyer said.</p>
<p>An independent trader was still heard offering a cargo bought this week but was said to have softened the price a little from $120 cif earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices (of low sulphur straight-run) are generally a little bit off on crude falling last night,&quot; a second trader said.</p>
<p>Other sellers who were offering as high as $117 on Thursday were not actively in the market today.</p>
<p>With most of the August cargoes left unsold crowded around the end of the month, low sulphur straight-run prices were bound to come off more, traders added.</p>
<p>Russian high sulphur straight-run was talked steady to a touch weaker, with M-100 offered at about two means +$4/5, compared with a deal on Thursday at two means +$5.</p>
<p>&quot;Straight-run is reasonably steady except for the influence of crude on it. If crude comes crashing down then straight-run has no choice but to follow suit to remain competitive,&quot; one trader said.</p>
