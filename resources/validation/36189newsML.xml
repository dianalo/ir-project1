<p>He is everywhere. On the street, in offices, on every banknote, the bland, fleshy face of Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov stares out from countless portraits across the desert nation of four million.</p>
<p>But the anger the impoverished Turkmens feel at Niyazov, known as &quot;Turkmenbashi&quot; or leader of the Turkmens, can be felt like the hot wind that blows off the surrounding Kara Kum desert.</p>
<p>For despite substantial reserves of natural gas and oil, most Turkmens find it hard to feed their families adequately.</p>
<p>Police now stand guard near the larger photographs and tawdry portraits -- diplomats say some unguarded pictures have been defaced.</p>
<p>The images, bleached by the sun, show Niyazov sitting next to a vase of flowers; in a traditional red cloak; in front of the United Nations headquarters in New York.</p>
<p>His cult has all but erased that of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin, one small statue of whom has been allowed to stand in a city park.</p>
<p>In the centre of the capital Ashgabat, a statue of Niyazov's mother carrying him as a child depicts him as a Turkmen Christ.</p>
<p>If Niyazov is not speaking on state television, men in sharp suits and women in long dresses and headscarves are singing his praises. Children recite poems in his honour.</p>
<p>Mosques, towns and roads are named after Niyazov who, like most other leaders in the former Soviet south, made a smooth transition from Communist Party boss to strongman leader after independence in 1991.</p>
<p>But save for his daily dash in a convoy of shiny foreign cars from the presidential palace to another in the cool hills above the city, the 56-year-old leader is rarely seen in public.</p>
<p>A new wall has been built within the tall iron railings which already surround the palace gardens to prevent passersby looking in.</p>
<p>Houses have been torn down around a new presidential palace being built by a French firm, which promises to be more opulent than the last. Locals say the demolition is because officials fear the buildings could provide cover for an assassin.</p>
<p>A whole strip of new hotels, their pastel colours and marble fountains a mix of Las Vegas and 1001 Nights kitsch, stand empty while Turkmens travel from across the desert country to Ashgabat to queue for a loaf of bread.</p>
<p>Supplies of subsidised food are drying up in state shops. State salaries of around $10 a month -- if they are paid -- go nowhere in the expensive private markets.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like to go out to shop now, the people in the queues are shaking with anger, I am afraid,&quot; said a Turkmen woman who did not want to be named. &quot;The old have patience but not the young,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>No dissent or opposition is tolerated.</p>
<p>&quot;May my tongue shrivel up and my bones turn to ashes if I betray my country or my president,&quot; is a stock phrase repeated throughout the day on state television and each morning before class by schoolchildren.</p>
<p>Diplomats and Turkmens say they know of no organised opposition inside the country. &quot;It is very dangerous to meet and talk in an organised way,&quot; said a disenchanted Turkmen businessman.</p>
<p>But a growing list of sacked ministers and officials shows a touch of nerves at the top.</p>
<p>Niyazov fired a string of officials to try to shift the blame for this year's disastrous wheat harvest. Officially, the harvest was 600,000 tonnes short of the one million tonne target for 1996 -- but it could be even less.</p>
<p>Ashgabat buzzes with political jokes as bitter as the Turkmens' camelthorn tea.</p>
<p>A favourite is the &quot;presidential striptease&quot; -- a Niyazov portrait on the manat banknote is transformed into a person's behind by covering most of his face save for the double chin.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the growing and surprisingly open anger will explode.</p>
<p>&quot;There might be bread riots but there doesn't appear to be any real figure or idea to oppose Niyazov,&quot; said one diplomat.</p>
<p>The Turkmen businessman agreed. &quot;People are starving in North Korea but nothing's changed there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Turkmenistan's main revenues from gas exports remain imprisoned in Russian pipelines, diverted to former Soviet neighbours who cannot pay.</p>
<p>Niyazov admits that not everybody can reap the benefits of Turkmenistan's huge natural resources.</p>
<p>&quot;Not everyone can be rich,&quot; he said on state television. &quot;Usually one in 10 is rich and the other nine must work for him.&quot;</p>
