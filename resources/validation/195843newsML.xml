<headline>NWE gas oil drifts amid jitters over IPE squeeze.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE gas oil premiums were talked unchanged to slightly easier on Monday but demand slackened as jittery traders sought to guard against potential price volatility resulting from a squeeze on the Nov IPE expiry.</p>
<p>Benchmark IPE finished down $2 at $218.75 per tonne for the Dec contract in thin trade amid uncertainty over the outcome of the record high 865,100 tonne delivery on the Nov contract.</p>
<p>Barge dealers complained barges were queuing to take delivery of the IPE delivery but some traders disputed that, saying loading later on Monday was almost normal.</p>
<p>A cargo of low sulphur diesel (-7/-22) traded at Dec IPE +$15 into Rostock for late November, equivalent to +$16 into Hamburg, around unchanged. A barge of refinery grade heating oil was done at Dec +$2.50 for early December, also unchanged.</p>
<p>A cargo of French heating oil was offered slightly easier at Dec IPE +$6.50/7 and bid at +$5/6 into Le Havre. German was offered at Dec IPE +$6 and bid at +$4 for late November.</p>
<p>Large Russian cargoes were offered at formula +$2.50 and bid at evens. Heating oil barges were offered at Dec IPE +$1.75/$2 for storage material and +$3.50, $4 and $4.50 for refinery grade for end November. -- William Maclean, London +44 171 542 7646</p>
