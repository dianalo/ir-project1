<p>Britain's Labour government told UNESCO on Monday it would rejoin the organisation on July 1, a dozen years after the conservatives slammed the door, in order to take part in the organisation's aid to poor countries.</p>
<p>&quot;My government has decided to rejoin UNESCO...My aim is that this should take effect from July 1 this year,&quot; Secretary of State for International Development Clare Short told UNESCO's executive board in a message delivered by aide Tony Bazeley.</p>
<p>&quot;The object is to maximise UNESCO's effectiveness and impact, particularly in poorest countries and for the poorest people. That is an important goal for us in all our development endeavours,&quot; Short's message said.</p>
<p>The Labour government, which came to power on May 1, announced two weeks ago that it would rejoin the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.</p>
<p>Conservative former prime minister Margaret Thatcher had taken Britain out of UNESCO in 1985, a year after the United States withdrew. Between them, the two countries took away 30 percent of the budget of the organisation which they accused of poor management and anti-Western bias. Washington has yet to rejoin though it says it is studying the matter.</p>
