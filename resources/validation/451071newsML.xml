<title>GREECE: Greek fixed coupon bonds hold in late dealings.</title>
<headline>Greek fixed coupon bonds hold in late dealings.</headline>
<dateline>ATHENS 1997-03-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Greek interbank deposits and forex forwards were stable in late Tuesday dealings and fixed coupon bonds were trading narrowly awaiting the auction of three-, five-and seven-year on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Depos and swaps are stable overall. There is a small buying interest for one-year swaps which are trading around 10.80,&quot; a state bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Investors are buying drachmas for dollars, possibly because they need money for the auction on Wednesday, the dealer said.</p>
<p>The central bank kept its intervention rate in overnight money unchanged at 11.90 percent.</p>
<p>Bond dealers said trading in fixed coupon bonds was subdued.</p>
<p>&quot;We were expecting the fixed coupon bonds market to be active in view of tomorrow's auction. However, it is quiet late on Tuesday. There are no signs of demand for the auctioned bonds as of yet,&quot; a bond dealer at a foreign bank said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Greece will auction 150 billion drachmas of three-year bonds, 100 billion of five-year bonds and 50 billion of seven-year bonds.</p>
<p>Their coupons are set at 9.8, 9.2 and 8.9 percent for three-, five- and seven-year bonds, respectively.</p>
<p>There was small buying interest for two-year zero-coupon bonds on Tuesday, the dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some buying interest for two-year zero-coupon bonds because investors think of them as more tradeable,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The auction of the three-year bond is expected to be successful as foreign investors will forego the other best alternative which is the expensive, taxable issue of January 28, the dealer said.</p>
<p>The government's intention was to create a new market to test the demand for five-and seven- year issues, the dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;A benchmark will be created for five- and seven- year bonds. This market was covered only by floaters up to now. I consider this auction as a test, aimed at exploring further potential,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>Coupon rates are considered reasonable seen in line with the government's economic goals for 2001, the dealer added.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 157.88/98 from Tuesday's 157.840 fix, the dollar at 266.02/12 drachmas from 266.290 and the Ecu at 305.44/54 from 305.380 drachmas.</p>
<p>&quot;We had sales of ecus for drachmas, mainly from British investors. There is some uncertainty with regard to the timely and successful realisation of the EMU causing some harm to the ecu,&quot; a forex dealer at a foreign bank said.</p>
<p>There is speculation that Germany might not make it in the first group of countries to the EMU, the dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;This has caused the mark to rise and recover some of its earlier losses against the Italian lira and other European currencies,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>Ecu/drachma is currently trading at 305.41-46, the dealer said.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece, the domestic money market's biggest player, quoted the following late rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at 11.40-11.90</p>
<p>** T/N at 11.40-11.90</p>

<p>** One month at 11.35-11.85</p>

<p>** Nine months at 10.90-11.40</p>
