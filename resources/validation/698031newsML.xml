<p>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co Inc plans to target middle-income female shoppers and focus on its core appliance and furniture businesses in an effort to turn the ailing retail chain around.</p>
<p>Ward said Tuesday it would remodel four to six stores early next year to boost sales and attract its target customer, which it identified as a female shopper between 30 and 55 years old earning an annual household income of $25,000 to $50,000.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have worked diligently during the past several months to develop a comprehensive strategic plan that will reposition the company, revise our financial structure and improve the planning process,&quot; Roger Goddu, Montgomery Ward's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. &quot;Our initiatives will focus on our merchandise strengths.&quot;</p>
<p>The strategy was formed after interviews with 3,000 consumers and 500 Montgomery Ward managers by a market research firm, said spokeswoman Judy Gustafson.</p>
<p>The retailer, which operates 346 department stores, said it would emphasize its strongest-selling merchandise, including appliances, a market category in which Ward ranks second in terms of sales volume in the United States. The company also is the No. 3 furniture retailer and the biggest U.S. seller of mattresses.</p>
<p>In addition, the company said its jewelry sales rank among the top five on a volume-per-store basis in the United States.</p>
<p>The privately held company, a unit of Montgomery Ward Holding Corp, has not decided whether to close under-performing stores, Gustafson said. Ward also is talking with lenders about modifying terms of debt agreements.</p>
