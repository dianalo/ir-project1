<p>Detlef Mueller had never owned a share in his life and before Deutsche Telekom began invading his living room each night with alluring television advertisements he never gave the idea a second thought.</p>
<p>Like millions of Germans who have so far always put their money in low-yield savings accounts, the 30-year-old thought the stock market was too treacherous for his young family's savings.</p>
<p>But Mueller, an electrical engineer from Cologne, has suddenly caught stock market fever.</p>
<p>He drained his savings to put up nearly 9,000 marks ($6,000) for 300 of the new Telekom shares he hopes to pick up later this month and expects to make a handsome profit quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;I had never thought of owning shares before this,&quot; Mueller said. &quot;I always thought it was too risky. But all the ads got me curious. It looks like this is an easy way to make some money. I am still nervous about shares though and plan to take profits as soon as the price rises.&quot;</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom, the German phone company that is making Europe's largest ever initial public offering, succeeded beyond its wildest dreams in enticing millions of first-time investors like Mueller to crack open their piggy banks and place orders.</p>
<p>Ordinary Germans have long viewed the stock exchanges in Frankfurt and seven other German cities with deep suspicion, seeing them as casinos rather than a safe place for savings. The middle class has frowned on capital markets in a hangover from the country's financial turmoil in the 1920s and 1940s.</p>
<p>In a nation where those with market-made fortunes are loathed rather than admired, no one who got rich on the market would ever brag about it -- unlike in the U.S.</p>
<p>That may all be about to change.</p>
<p>Telekom's 100-million mark advertising campaign has been inescapable -- on billboards, in newspapers and in prime-time television for months. The unprecedented campaign has whipped up an astonishing frenzy for the telephone giant's flotation.</p>
<p>&quot;We have succeeded with the marketing surrounding the T-share over the past weeks and months of stirring up real stock fever in Germany,&quot; said Telekom chief executive Ron Sommer.</p>
<p>The offering is reported to be already six times oversubscribed even though banks are still taking orders for thousands of first time shareholders each day. Ovewhelmed bank clerks are said to be turning customers away, wrongly telling them the share is &quot;sold out.&quot;</p>
<p>More than three million Germans signed up for Telekom's special shareholder information forum and more than half are thought to have placed orders.</p>
<p>Karl-Heinz Drimmer, manager of a savings bank in Bonn, said hundreds of first-time shareholders have flooded his branch office, some enduring hour-long waits to place their orders.</p>
<p>Compounding the delays is the fact that it has taken banks a long time to explain and fill out orders for the neophyte shareholders, warning them as required by law of the risks.</p>
<p>One civil servant, undeterred by the bank's mandatory warning, put down 300,000 marks and ordered 10,000 shares, Drimmer said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had everything from the grannies to high government officials come in here,&quot; he said. &quot;We've seen skilled workers and pensioners. All ages, all walks of life. The one thing they have in common is the expectation of earning money.&quot;</p>
<p>Ulrich Bruse, a 26-year-old Hamburg biology student, is one of those first-time shareholders who said he had put his savings from the last three years into Telekom shares.</p>
<p>&quot;The conditions for this look very attractive,&quot; Bruse said. &quot;It looks like a can't-miss story. They want it to be a success so they won't let the price fall. The dividend returns are much better than a savings account. It's too good a deal to pass up.&quot;</p>
<p>Shares begin trading in Germany and New York on November 18 and a day later in Tokyo. They are expected to cost around 30 marks.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the Telekom offering succeeds in turning Germany into a &quot;nation of small shareholders&quot; along the lines of the United States or Britain, where one in five people have investments in stocks.</p>
<p>Only one in 16 Germans currently owns shares, giving the country one of the lowest shareholder levels of leading industrialised nations. Only some five percent of private assets in Germany are invested in shares compared with 17 percent in Britain, 21 percent in the U.S. and 35 percent in Sweden.</p>
<p>German firms may be among the most successful, exporting cars and machines to the far corners of the world. But owning even a small stake in those multinational giants has so far been anathema to the German baker, butcher or candlestick maker.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that this offering will at long last spark interest in broad stock ownership,&quot; said Ronald Weichert, spokesman for Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. &quot;Suddenly, owning shares has become a topic of conversation in Germany.</p>
