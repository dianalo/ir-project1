<title>UK: UK's FTSE 100 sets record close as rate fears ease.</title>
<headline>UK's FTSE 100 sets record close as rate fears ease.</headline>
<text>
<p>** FTSE 100 sets second record close of year so far, up 38.6</p>
<p>	 pts at 4,197.5 as gilts surge on drop in inflation and UK</p>
<p>	 interest rates left unchanged at six percent.</p>
<p>** Wall St also lends support, Dow up 45 as London closes.</p>
<p>** Insurers up sharply on bid talk, Salomon recommendation.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's just incredible,&quot; said one trader.&quot;Oviously the inflation data helped and the pressure on interest rates has been relieved.&quot;</p>
<p>Michael Beggs, fund manager for UK equities at Guinness Flight Global Asset Management, said funds had flowed into UK stocks this year as fears about the strength of the pound and rising interest rates receded.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year most institutions increased their liquidity and their weightings in UK equities fell through the year,&quot; Beggs said. &quot;The UK was cheap relative to other markets. But if the FTSE got to 4,300 or 4,350 it would be time to run for cover.&quot;  </p>
<p>Traders said the market had so far followed its traditional pattern of rising in January, when seasonal inflows of cash into investment funds produce what is regularly one of the market's strongest months of the year.</p>
<p>Added the head of equity trading at one brokerage: &quot;For the time being the market is only reacting to good news. We have got a raging bull market, but sooner or later it will settle down and people will realise that rates could still go up. In some ways it would have been better to get the rise over this week.&quot;</p>
<p>Other indexes were also strong, with the FTSE Mid 250 up 5.9 points at 4,565.9, just short of its record set last April.  </p>
<p>The Reuters-HSBC index of 150 leading stocks closed up 9.74 points or 0.9 percent at 1,135.02. Trading volume across the market reached an active 863  million shares by 1658 GMT.</p>
<p>The Dow was up about 45 points as London closed</p>
<p>UK stocks were marked lower at the opening after a drop on Wall Street but a lack of selling pressure combined with a shortage of stock helped to reverse early losses and the FTSE 100 powered to an intraday record of 4,198.9 by early afternoon.</p>
<p>The long gilts future closed 25/32 higher at 110-11/16 after figures showed a drop in the UK's underlying inflation rate to 3.1 percent from 3.3 percent.  </p>
<p>Later the Bank of England indicated no change in the UK's 6.0 percent interest rate following yesterday's regular policy meeting with Chancellor Kenneth Clarke -- allaying market anxieties after yesterday's sharp fall in the jobless total.</p>
<p>Strategists said a dip in the inflation figures justified the decision to keep interest rates on hold for the time being, but rates may still have to rise in February if the Chancellor sticks to his 2.5 percent inflation target.</p>
<p>Insurers helped power today's advance amid further bid talk, a recommendation from Salomon Brothers and a buoyant trading statement from Legal &amp; General, up 6p at 398-1/2.  </p>
<p>Composite insurers were lifted by a positive review by analysts at Salomon, with General Accident up 27p at 820-1/2 and Commercial Union up 13-1/2p at 728-1/2.</p>
<p>GKN was another big gainer, up 31-1/2p to 971-1/2p as SBC Warburg rated the stock a &quot;buy,&quot; while Tomkins rose 8p to 276 as Kleinwort Benson rated the stock &quot;buy&quot;.</p>
<p>Hanson rose 2-1/2p to 88 amid U.S. buying following positive comment from analysts at the company's broker ABN AMRO Hoare Govett earlier this week.</p>
<p>Yet Abbey National fell 11-1/2p to 784-1/2 as Credit Lyonnais Laing cut the stock to &quot;hold&quot; after its strong run.  </p>
<p>John Menzies tumbled 70p to 475p after a fall in first-half profits and a drop in Christmas sales while Lanica Trust dived 175p to 13.75 stg after the company said it was not aware of any reason for the recent huge rise in its share price.</p>
