<p>Singapore gas oil swaps drifted sideways in quiet trading at midday on Tuesday as the market awaited fresh physical indicators, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is steady, there is not much going on right now,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>May swaps were last quoted at $25.50/$25.70, down a mere five cents from Monday, brokers said.</p>
<p>The May/June backwardation was unchanged at a $1.00/$1.10 per barrel.</p>
<p>Traders said the market has lost a lot of its volatility as a result of the recent large purchases by local traders.  </p>
<p>&quot;The prices are coming down slowly and you can see this from the physical bids and offers,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The local traders have since early March bought more than 15 million barrels but the purchases did not lead to a sharp price hike.</p>
<p>Physical prices have instead trekked a steady downward path from a high of about $28.75 per barrel to around $26.00 over the past two months.</p>
<p>Slipping prices and the steep backwardation are expected to deter traders from planning another round of large arbitrage exports from the West, industry sources said.  </p>
<p>Fuel oil swaps were steady with May quoted at $98.00/$99.00, brokers said.</p>
