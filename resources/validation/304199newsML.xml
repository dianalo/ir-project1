<headline>Sears shares up after Freemans disposal.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-13</dateline>

<p>Shares in Sears Plc rose on Monday after the retail group said it was selling its mail order business Freemans for 395 million stg and planned to return the cash to shareholders.</p>
<p>Separately press reports said the company could be the target for a takeover and was preparing bid defences, though dealers were sceptical that a bid would emerge.</p>
<p>&quot;The company has got too many fundamental problems,&quot; said one, &quot;I don't think there will be a bid while it still owns British Shoe Corporation.&quot;  </p>
<p>The stock was up 1-1/2p at 89-1/2 by 0815 GMT, after last week touching its lowest level in more than three years folowing a profit warning from the company.  </p>
<p>The disposal comes after press reports said Sears chief executive Liam Strong, under pressure after last week's profit warning, would meet major shareholders this week to discuss his plans.</p>
<p>A report in the Sunday Times said more than 70 percent of big investors in Sears believed he should go after the profit warning. Sears shares have underperformed the market since Strong took over five years ago.  </p>
