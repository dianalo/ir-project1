<p>The U.S. Congress has little incentive to repeal the two percent &quot;de minimis&quot; rule since such a move would raise little, if any, revenues for federal coffers, a John Nuveen &amp; Co. official said in a report.</p>
<p>President Clinton in his proposed fiscal 1998 federal budget called for repeal of a series of corporate tax &quot;loopholes&quot; in the U.S. tax code, including the de minimis rule.</p>
<p>But Cadmus Hicks, vice president in Nuveen Research, said in four-page analysis that U.S. Treasury Department estimates of how much the federal government would make from repeal have declined considerably over the past two years.</p>
<p>&quot;The last time the administration made this proposal (in 1996), the U.S. Treasury Department estimated that repeal would increase federal tax revenues by $500 million over the next seven years as corporations switch to taxable investments,&quot; Hicks said.</p>
<p>President Clinton's latest proposed budget, however, estimates that repeal only would increase revenues by $200 million over the next five years, Hicks said.</p>
<p>&quot;It would not raise very much money. In fact there is a question whether it would result in any increase in federal revenues,&quot; Hicks said in a telephone interview. As a result, this proposal &quot;may eventually be rejected&quot; by Capitol Hill, Hicks said.</p>
<p>Currently, individuals can fall into one of four tax brackets - 28 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent or 39.6 percent,&quot; Hicks said. But before 1993, the top bracket was only 31 percent, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Then, you could be sure that if corporations were no longer able to hold (tax-exempt bonds) they would be held by people in a 31 percent tax bracket,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But, now, since we have  a 36 percent and 39.6 percent tax bracket, it's not a sure thing. You may actually have these securities going out of the hands of corporations into the hands of retail customers who actually get a bigger write off because they are in a higher bracket,&quot; Hicks said.</p>
<p>Currently, the Internal Revenue Service does not permit businesses to deduct interst on debt that they use to finance the purchase of tax exempt bonds.</p>
<p>But, the IRS said in 1972, in what is dubbed the de minimis rule, that it will not monitor whether a corporation has borrowed to purchase tax-exempt bonds as long as those holdings total less than two percent of a firm's net assets.</p>
