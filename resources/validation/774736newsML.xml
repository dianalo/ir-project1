<p>The brutal years of Hitler's Third Reich followed by 40 years of East German commmunism could not force Erwin Guenzel to leave the village of Altreetz.</p>
<p>Now, faced with what could yet be the worst flooding in over 200 years, Guenzel and his neighbours are again refusing to leave, preferring to fill sandbags rather than pack their bags and head for higher ground.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw what the Nazis did to my home and my family, even as a small boy during that time and I had my problems with the communists too,&quot; the 66-year-old Guenzel said as he heaved a sandbag onto a wooden pallet.</p>
<p>&quot;When you've lived through all that, you're not about to give up everything you've built because of a flood.&quot;</p>
<p>Guenzel's feelings are shared by almost everyone in this village with 300 residents, where most have said they will still stay in harm's way should the dike along the Oder river burst.</p>
<p>In the village square, dozens of locals sat beneath a canopy of ancient oak trees, drinking refreshments and resting from days of sandbagging.</p>
<p>Many people left their homes 10 days ago when the local authorities began evacuating the region only to return within days, ignoring police orders to stay away, in order to do their best to save their homes from the impending flood.</p>
<p>To the east of Altreetz lies the main line of dikes on the Oder river that is part of Germany's border with Poland. To the south and west soldiers have been building a line of secondary dikes, to protect outlying towns should the main dike break.</p>
<p>Now the villagers fear soldiers could allow Altreetz to be engulfed by the water in order to save the larger towns of Bad Freienwalde and Wrietzen.</p>
<p>Refusing to give up hope that the main dike can still be saved, the entire village from small children to housewives and grandparents is pitching in, filling sandbags and keeping the pressure up on authorities not to abandon the main dike.</p>
<p>Even Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who visited the village last week, became the target of village concerns as he was surrounded by dozens of local residents who demanded that he pledge not to give up a single inch of the main dike.</p>
<p>The town itself has become a crack volunteer corps, led by the volunteer fire department and a team of local mothers.</p>
<p>Villagers begin work each day at 7 a.m, filling sandbags or cooking soup and sausages until the sun sets over the staple crop of sunflowers at about 9:30 in the evening.</p>
<p>&quot;Look around,&quot; said Guenzel, &quot;people are still living their lives here, getting by, helping each other. But here it's filled with volunteers and not just the boys from the army.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked how long a shift he planned on putting in for the day, Guenzel waved away one of the incessant flies that have decended on the region since the floods, squinted up at the midday sun and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, I'm retired and can't really make it as long as the younger ones,&quot; he said. &quot;I imagine I'll have to call it a day at around eight tonight.&quot;</p>
