<p>SIMEX Nikkei stock futures ended firmer on Wednesday after absorbing the effects of the suspension of trade in Sumitomo Trust &amp; Banking Co stocks.</p>
<p>Rumours the trust bank had incurred heavy foreign exchange losses triggered some liquidation but buying resumed after the bank denied the speculation at a press conference in Tokyo.</p>
<p>&quot;Tokyo stocks fell on the rumours but there is potential for more upside,&quot; a dealer with a Japanese commission house said, adding that Nikkei futures were technically bullish.</p>
<p>The key Nikkei 225 June contract ended 75 points higher at 20,245, after briefly brushing lows at 20,050.  </p>
<p>U.S. institutions were seen buying Nikkei futures following Sumitomo's denial of foreign exchange problems and also after a senior Japanese government official said downside risk to the economy had decreased.</p>
<p>The Nikkei was seen likely to consolidate around 20,000 points and to attempt to break 20,300 in the short-term.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the SIMEX Taiwan MSCI index moved sharply higher in line with the Taiwan cash index, which posted the largest one-day gain in nine months.</p>
<p>The May contract rose to 342.2, up 8.8 points on a moderate volume of 1,011 lots. -- Jacqueline Wong (65 8703088)</p>
