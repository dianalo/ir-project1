<p>The managing director of Italy's state railway, Giancarlo Cimoli, said on Tuesday magistrates had informed him he was under investigation following a high-speed train derailment in which eight people were killed.</p>
<p>Cimoli issued a statement pledging full cooperation with the enquiries after Italian news agency reports that he was among four people who had been formally notified of an investigation.</p>
<p>The prosecutors' office in the northern city of Piacenza confirmed that several people had been advised they faced investigation but would neither disclose the names nor the suspected offences.</p>
<p>The investigation followed the derailment on January 12 of a &quot;pendolino&quot; high-speed train as it was entering Piacenza station. Eight people were killed and some 30 injured.</p>
<p>Under Italian law, individuals suspected of an offence must be notified that they are under investigation. The notification does not mean charges will automatically follow.</p>
