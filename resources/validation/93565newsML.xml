<title>VENEZUELA: Venezuela oil windfall to pay debt - Caldera.</title>
<headline>Venezuela oil windfall to pay debt - Caldera.</headline>
<dateline>MATURIN, Venezuela 1996-10-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Venezuela's President Rafael Caldera on Thursday backed calls to spend windfall oil revenues produced by higher-than-expected oil prices on reducing Venezuela's debts.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to commit the madness of the era of plenty when we had to give money here and there to those who asked for it while leaving the same heavy burden of the foreign and domestic debt,&quot; Caldera told a conference of business and political leaders in western Venezuela.</p>
<p>&quot;This income which we are receiving...will be invested fundamentally in reducing the debt burden,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Government officials have calculated that higher-than- expected oil prices boosted by recent tension in the Middle East should bring Venezuela windfall revenues of about $2.5 billion this year.</p>
<p>Demands on this money have been great but Caldera's ministers, backed by the International Monetary Fund, have stressed that the extra money should be used to pay off debt.</p>
<p>Caldera went on to tackle criticisms that the process of privatizing banks and selling assets will only recover a small proportion of financial aid given to the financial sector in 1994 and 1995.</p>
<p>State Deposits Guarantee Fund (FOGADE) President Esther de Margulis said earlier in the week that the government would recover just 24.5 percent of the 2.537 trillion bolivars ($14.9 billion at the exchange rate of 170 bolivars per dollar in effect until Dec 11, 1995) loaned to banks during the financial crisis.</p>
<p>But Caldera pointed out Thursday that in the midst of the banking sector crisis his government raised the amount banks contribute to FOGADE from 0.5 to two percent of their total deposits.</p>
<p>According to Caldera, this measure will bring in 1.3 trillion bolivars over 10 years and 2.6 trillion bolivars over 20 years.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the bankers who will pay for the financial aid,&quot; Caldera said.</p>
<p>Caldera concluded that thanks to the economic reform program his government launched in mid-April, &quot;we have every right to be optimistic.&quot;</p>
