<title>SINGAPORE: No word on condition of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew.</title>
<headline>No word on condition of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-01-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Singapore hospital officials declined comment on Sunday on the condition of Lee Kuan Yew, the city-state's long-time former prime minister who entered hospital on Saturday for scheduled tests on his bladder.</p>
<p>Officials at Singapore General Hospital, where Lee was examined on Saturday by the head of the urology department, told Reuters they could give out no information on him.</p>
<p>Government officials were unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>The office of Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong issued a brief statement on Saturday saying that Lee, 73, had had chronic inflammatory tissue removed from the wall of his bladder on two previous occasions.</p>
<p>&quot;His stay in hospital will depend upon the extent of the operation,&quot; it said. It gave no other details of his condition.</p>
<p>Lee, who led Singapore for 31 years until 1990 and remains in the cabinet as Senior Minister, retains considerable political influence.</p>
<p>He underwent two heart operations in early 1996, raising fears of a drop on local financial markets.</p>
<p>The markets took news of his condition in their stride, however, a reaction which Lee said afterwards proved Singapore had accepted that the reins of power had passed to a new generation.</p>
<p>A doctor contacted by Reuters on Saturday said inflammation of the bladder was a fairly common condition and was usually caused by an infection.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of the tests may be to make sure there's nothing more serious -- to make sure it is not cancerous,&quot; said the doctor, who declined to be identified.</p>
