<p>-------------Analysis by Daniel Fock - June 16---------------</p>
<p>*New highs again</p>
<p>*Support moves higher to 2,615</p>
<p>*Leading indicators higher, remaining overbought</p>
<p>The Australian All Ordinaries continues making new highs. Traders will continue to remain long while support and 2,600 holds.</p>
<p>All good things come to an end, but while the index moves higher, go with the trend. Traders will keep trailing stops, as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>Short term technicals are bullish. Averages are bullish. Leading indicators are higher again except for the ROC. With solid trends, leading indicators can be rather misleading.</p>
<p>However, the index is overbought, and we wait for the indicators to fall as a pre-emptive signal.</p>
<p>Traders will be focusing on the short averages as a signal of a possible end to the rally.</p>
<p>In the medium term the index again makes a new high. Traders remain cautious, stay with the trend and continue to raise stops. Key levels to watch are 2,590, 2,570 and 2,500.</p>
<p>Medium term technicals are bullish. The averages are bullish. Leading indicators are overbought, fell slightly last week, but are now higher.</p>
<p>Fibonacci retracements are 2,535, 2,498 and 2,461.</p>
<p>In the longer term, the index is still bullish and making new highs for the month. While above last months high of 2,617 bulls will remain comfortable.</p>
<p>Like most traders, longer term bulls are increasingly cautious and apprehensive about the continuation of the rise at the same rate.</p>
<p>Longer term technicals are bullish and very overbought. The averages remain bullish, and all the leading indicators are overbought. Traders are likely to remain cautiously bullish, as concerns about a retracement continue.</p>
<p>Fibonacci retracements are 2,334, 2,235 and 2,135.</p>
<p>The index rallies again to another new high. Overbought leading indicators are higher again, only one, the short term RSI is off its high. Other indicators are showing the index overextended - this is normal in strongly trending markets.</p>
<p>Continue to trade with the trend and keep raising trailing stops. The index has finished at the high for the week and the month, and the year etc. While this is a good bullish indication, seasoned bulls will still remain calm and circumspect.</p>
