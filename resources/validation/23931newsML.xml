<title>NIGERIA: Tribunal clears deposed Nigerian Moslem leader.</title>
<headline>Tribunal clears deposed Nigerian Moslem leader.</headline>
<dateline>LAGOS 1996-08-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>A tribunal on Friday absolved the former spiritual leader of Nigeria's 50 million Moslems from charges of contributing to the collapse of two banks.</p>
<p>&quot;The former Sultan Ibrahim Dasuki has no case to answer as the prosecution have failed to establish any case against him,&quot; tribunal judge Musliu Ope-Agbe told a Lagos court.</p>
<p>In April the military government dethroned Dasuki as Sultan of the northern city of Sokoto and arrested him.</p>
<p>Financial offences were among the reasons given for his removal from office.</p>
<p>The 72-year-old former Moslem cleric and two companies in which he used to be a director were charged before a failed banks tribunal for allegedly owing 775 million naira ($9.7 million) to two banks that had collapsed.</p>
<p>&quot;Dasuki was only a director in the companies indebted to the two failed banks. As a director he had no part to play in the day to day running of the companies, so he is cleared of the charges,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dasuki has been kept under house arrest in a remote town in northeastern Nigeria.</p>
<p>Nigeria set up the failed banks tribunal last year to try those believed to be involved in large scale fraud in the banking sector, which led to the collapse of some banks in the country.</p>
<p>As Sultan of Sokoto, Dasuki was the spiritual leader of Nigerian Moslems. After his dethronement he was quickly replaced with another Sokoto prince, Muhammadu Maccido.</p>
