<p>QUESTION OF THE WEEK - After what was seen as a bullish speech on the interest rate outlook by RBA Governor Macfarlane and favourable second quarter wages report this week, December bank bill futures have priced in a 25 basis point easing.</p>
<p>Economists were surveyed to find out what current expectations were on official interest rates.</p>
<p>The odds on there being a sixth interest rate cut are seen as higher than they were two weeks ago -- the median forecast has risen to 40 percent from 30 percent ahead of the August 5 RBA board meeting but a rate cut is still seen as a less than even-money bet.</p>
<p>Signs of stronger growth are expected to lead to concerns about rising inflation and this is expected to see rates left on hold at 5.0 percent. Given the RBA's confidence on the wages and inflation outlook, any weakness in activity indicators such as spending or employment will lift the odds on a rate cut.</p>
<p>If a cut occurs, it is expected before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The September or November RBA board meetings are seen as the most likely timings. November was the most favoured time because by then the RBA will have another round of inflation and wages data to consider.</p>

<p>COMPANY PROFITS - As the second quarter GDP round begins in earnest, a modest rise in June quarter company profits is expected. Some analysts said this would be a correction to the fall in the March quarter. Others said recent results suggested a positive finish to the 1996/97 fiscal year. For those looking for a fall, some pointed to an expected continued correction from December's 8.6 percent fall. A small fall would also leave annual growth at around five percent, consistent with the difficult conditions many firms have experienced over the year.</p>
