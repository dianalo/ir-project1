<p>Egghead Inc Friday reported financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended Dec. 28, and announced a restructuring program. The following is a copy of the comapny's statement.</p>
<p>--------------- PRESS RELEASE -----------</p>
<p>(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 31, 1997-- Egghead Inc. (NASDAQ: EGGS) today released financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended Dec. 28, 1996, and announced a strategic realignment of its business organization.</p>
<p>Financial Results</p>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>George P. Orban, chairman of the board, said the company earned $1.5 million, or $0.09 per share, in the quarter, on revenue of $113.2 million.  This compares with a net loss on continuing operations of $1.1 million, or $0.06 per share, on revenue of $121.7 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. Comparable store sales decreased 8%.  However, 14 of the company's 25 new-format stores that were in operation in the corresponding quarter last year posted comparable sales increases of 18%.</p>
<p>For the nine months, the company's consolidated revenue from continuing operations was $271.8 million, a decrease of 11.5% from $307.0 million last year.  Net loss from continuing operations for the nine months was $10.7 million, or $0.61 per share, compared to a net loss of $7.4 million, or $0.43 per share last year.</p>
<p>Strategic Realignment</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>&quot;In an effort to build upon actions already taken and an attempt to restore the company to profitability, the board has approved a substantial reorganization of Egghead's business. The reorganization will involve, among other things, closing 77 of the 156 Egghead stores and reducing the number of markets in which the company operates stores from 54 to 24,&quot; Orban said.  The company expects to effect nearly all of these closings immediately.</p>
<p>Revenues for the nine months ended Dec. 28, 1996, from the 79 remaining Egghead stores accounted for $164.7 million or 64% of Egghead's fiscal year-to-date retail store revenue. Comparable store revenues for this group decreased 4% for the nine-month period compared to a decrease of 12% for the entire company.  This group accounted for 108% of total year-to-date retail store profits, before distribution expense and corporate overhead.</p>
<p>Egghead is also substantially reducing its headquarters staff, closing its Lancaster, Pa., distribution center and offering for sale certain real estate assets including its headquarters building in Spokane.  Headquarters staff will relocate to another Spokane location.</p>
<p>The company also announced that Terry Strom, CEO, Kurt Conklin, senior VP, and Ron Smith, senior VP, would be leaving the company after a transitional period during which they would assist with the reorganization.  Strom will continue to work with Egghead in a consulting capacity.  Orban has been elected CEO.</p>
<p>The company expects to recognize a one-time charge against earnings of approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter ending March 29, 1997, for costs and write-offs related to closed stores, inventory liquidation, severance payments, and sale of certain real estate assets.</p>
<p>The reorganization is expected to reduce headquarters and distribution expense to approximately $16 million on an annualized basis from its anticipated level of $35 million in fiscal-year 1997 excluding discontinued operations.  By taking these actions Egghead plans to significantly reduce its operating loss in the next fiscal year as well as to improve its inventory turn ratio.</p>
<p>Orban said, &quot;Egghead's 5,000-square-foot C-4 stores have generated encouraging results.  In the third quarter, the 11 stores we relocated and upgraded in existing markets generated comparable increases in revenue of 20% and profit increases of 47%. Egghead is no longer primarily a software company.  Over 44% of our revenues for the third quarter were from the sale of computer systems, peripherals, accessories and services.  In fiscal-year 1998 we intend to test our ability to improve revenues, market share and profitability in certain key markets by replacing the original Egghead stores with larger stores emphasizing broader merchandise assortments, computer upgrades and installation services.  The company also expects to add new stores.  By the end of fiscal-year 1998 we plan to have an additional 15 new-format stores.&quot;</p>
<p>The company also plans to invest in its Internet business. &quot;This business is in its infancy, but is showing promising growth and consumer acceptance,&quot; Orban said.  In November, Egghead became the first major computer products retailer to deliver programs over the Internet directly to customers' computers.  </p>
<p>Orban stated, &quot;Our objective this coming fiscal year is to reduce our operating losses, improve our business processes and devote our resources to creating a foundation for renewed growth.  The actions approved by the board amount to a remaking of Egghead in a way that we believe should give us the opportunity to turn the company around. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with a positive net worth and $70 million in cash.  That strength has carried us through a difficult period and enhances our options for future growth in a competitive market as we re-position the company.&quot;</p>
<p>Egghead is a leading retailer of computer software, hardware and accessories.</p>
