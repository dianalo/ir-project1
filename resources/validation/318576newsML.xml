<p>Ecuador's financial markets are bracing for a run on the dollar and a jump in interest rates if President Abdala Bucaram's currency reforms do not win broad support, analysts say.</p>
<p>Social tension has mounted this month after steep public tariff hikes, calling into question the likely duration of a currency convertibility plan scheduled to start up July 1. The system would peg the sucre and the dollar at a ratio of four to one.  </p>
<p>&quot;People are concerned about whether or not the economic program will go into effect and fear that several reforms put to Congress, including convertibility, may not be approved,&quot; Luis Jacome, director of economic studies for the Development Studies Corp, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Analysts say the markets are worried about the government's delay in sending Congress a law on convertibility and fear the dollar will come under pressure.  </p>
<p>The shock ingredient came from Bucaram, who warned recently that if Congress did not back convertibility, he would beef up public spending and allow the local currency to erode further against the dollar.  In 1996 the sucre depreciated 24.27 percent with inflation at 25.53 percent.</p>
<p>Bucaram's warning was described by analysts as &quot;extortion,&quot; and is aggravated by the fact it is still unclear whether convertibility will be passed as an urgent economic law or be submitted to a plebiscite in the second quarter of the year.  </p>
<p>&quot;To hold a plebiscite would be to fuel uncertainty about the situation of the economy, especially considering the problems the government faces after raising public service costs and seeing its popularity drop,&quot; said Jacome.</p>
<p>Bucaram two weeks ago announced hikes in the price of electricity, gas, telephone services and bus fares in order to lay the foundations for the convertibility plan.</p>
<p>The tariff hikes triggered violent protests by students in Quito and union threats of a general strike.  </p>
<p>Economic analyst Francisco Zalles admitted the possibility of a run on the dollar, but said it would be controlled by the sale of dollars by the Central Bank whose international reserves are running at a strong $1.84 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Uncertainty is great, but the authorities would not fight a rise in the dollar with a rise in interest rates,&quot; said Zallas, pointing out the government would not jeopardize its greatest economic achievement: lowering interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;What could happen is that convertibility may not start at 4,000 sucres but rather at 5,000, after a depreciation,&quot; Zalles said.  </p>
<p>The depreciation would have two effects: reduce fears of a devaluation and help plug a fiscal deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;The main point is credibility, because if convertibility breaks down we would see a massive devaluation,&quot; said Zalles.</p>
<p>One of the first effects of Bucaram's reforms has been the merger of Banco de Guayaquil, Ecuador's seventh largest bank, and Banco Sociedad General.</p>
<p>Analysts believe it will set a trend of mergers and lead to the streamlining of the country's bloated banking sector, as happened several years ago in Argentina.</p>
<p>Former Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, hired as an advisor by Bucaram, launched a convertibility scheme in Argentina in 1991, taming runaway inflation and causing strong economic growth.</p>
