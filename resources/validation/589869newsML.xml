<p>A vote-buying scandal that rocked Brazil this week lost some steam on Friday, but a new poll showed it had managed to bite into President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's popularity.</p>
<p>Cardoso, facing his government's biggest scandal yet, received a respite on Friday after a week of political bombshells and market-rattling headlines about an alleged scam involving a bill that would allow him to run for re-election.</p>
<p>But while Brazil's leading newspapers carried no new revelations, a poll by daily Folha de Sao Paulo said the scandal already has taken its toll on Cardoso's popularity.</p>
<p>The survey by Folha, which broke news of the alleged cash-for-votes scheme, showed the approval rating of Cardoso's government has fallen to 34 percent from 41 percent just days before the scandal.</p>
<p>Folha on Tuesday published transcripts of secretly taped phone conversations and alleged that five members of the Chamber of Deputies took bribes to vote earlier this year for the re-election bill. The measure was now before the Senate.</p>
<p>That scoop was followed on Wednesday and on Thursday with reports that Communications Minister Sergio Motta may be linked to the scheme.</p>
<p>A tough-talking party loyalist and old friend of the president's, Motta has strongly denied the allegations, calling them &quot;absurd, untruthful and ... surreal.&quot; Cardoso has dismissed the reports as baseless &quot;insinuations.&quot;</p>
<p>The exclusive Folha reports and a flood of rumours afterward about upcoming stories, rocked financial markets. The Sao Paulo bourse on Wednesday posted its biggest one-day plunge this year, dropping 3.4 percent, and remained jittery despite recouping much of its losses by Friday.</p>
<p>Although the news barrage quieted by week's end, the issue was far from going away.</p>
<p>Cardoso huddled on Friday with an embattled Motta while opposition leaders in the lower house vowed to press on with efforts to launch a full congressional probe.</p>
<p>Brazil's opposition parties forged ahead with plans to form a wide-ranging investigatory panel despite government moves to scuttle the attempt.</p>
<p>As the opposition members of congress cavassed for signatures, party leaders said the full petition would be presented on Tuesday at the next full session of the lower house, perhaps with enough backing to enable the panel to be formed immediately.</p>
<p>Most political and market analysts doubt Cardoso will ever be tied directly to any wrongdoing but they were hedging their bets until they could be sure the series of Folha stories has run its course.</p>
<p>&quot;Supposedly the worst will come out on Sunday, but we'll have to wait and see,&quot; Tina Vandersteel, a fixed-income and political analyst at J.P. Morgan in Brazil said. &quot;If nothing more serious comes out, then I think we can get back to normal pretty soon.&quot;</p>
