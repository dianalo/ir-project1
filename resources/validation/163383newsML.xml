<title>SLOVAKIA: Slovak bourse drop seen attracting foreign interest.</title>
<headline>Slovak bourse drop seen attracting foreign interest.</headline>

<p>Leading Slovak shares closed mostly weaker in moderate trading on the Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) on Monday, driving the SAX index 3.47 points lower to 194.29.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected livelier trading activity this week as foreign investors return for bargains, though this did not necessarily mean a reversal of the market's overall downward trend.</p>
<p>Oil refiner Slovnaft closed down 40 at 850 crowns, with its average price - used for calculating the index - easing by 4.49 percent, accounting for the largest part on the SAX's decline.</p>
<p>Only six shares traded in Slovnaft on the BSE floor, and brokers said they were sceptical over the issue's future.</p>
<p>&quot;Slovnaft has been a dead share since news on the EBRD's intention to sell its stake in the refiner back to the state broke. So there seems to be no potential for the issue's possible recovery in near future,&quot; Dusan Sykora of ING Barings said.</p>
<p>Oil and gas storage company Nafta lost 98 crowns to close at 1,852, but on only five shares traded.</p>
<p>Brokers said the bourse's decline the past few weeks has started to bring prices to interesting levels even for foreign investors, and should result in higher trading activity.</p>
<p>&quot;The market may continue to decline further for some time, but the trend itself is not so important as the lower prices will attract more investors,&quot; Sykora said.</p>
<p>Steel maker VSZ was the only one blue chip to post slight gains, closing up four crowns at 605. Traders said VSZ was the most promising issue as there was enough room and good fundamental reasons for its increase in near future.</p>
<p>The country's largest commercial bank VUB closed down 25 crowns at 1,720.</p>
<p>Overall volume fell to 298,956 shares, from 728,672 shares traded on Thursday, turnover decreased to 217.19 million crowns, from Thursday's 525.87 million. -- Peter Laca, Bratislava Newsroom, 42-7-563-3687</p>
