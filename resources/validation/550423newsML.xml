<title>JAPAN: Tokyo stocks likely to chug higher after US market.</title>

<dateline>TOKYO 1996-05-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tokyo stocks are likely to chug higher in Thursday's trading session, following a rise in U.S. stock markets overnight, brokers said. They said blue chips which helped the Nikkei average close on Wednesday at its highest since December 30 would be sought after again.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the 225-share Nikkei average rose 480.75 points or 2.57 percent to end at 19,151.12. June Nikkei futures added 600 points to end at 19,250.</p>
<p>&quot;Stocks will probably start out firm today, especially since Nikkei futures in Chicago posted huge gains on Wednesday,&quot; a broker at New Japan Securities said.  </p>
<p>&quot;But gains over 19,500 could be difficult as the index has been rising at a fairly fast pace lately and needs to slow down,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Overnight in the U.S. markets, Nikkei 225 futures surged 565 points to close at 19,440. The Dow industrials added 47 points to close unofficially at 7,009.  </p>
<p>&quot;U.S. hedge funds actively bought Nikkei futures on Wednesday, so there was a need to cover cash shorts this morning,&quot; a broker at Okasan Securities  said. &quot;Once that finishes however, the index may have trouble gaining.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers added that there was a slight feeling of relief in the market that the feared melt-down of the Japanese financial sector was retreating, with Nippon Credit Bank Ltd share prices stablising.</p>
<p>&quot;The recent interest in futures may mean that investors think the stifling effect of the consumption tax increase may not be too serious after all,&quot; one second-tier broker said.  </p>
<p>Japan's consumption was raised by two percentage points starting on April 1, the beginning of the new business year.</p>
<p>Foreign investor buying interest was strong, but brokers said that pension funds were poised to buy on dips in times of weakness, which was also mentally soothing for the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Buyers planning to wait around to buy on dips were getting left behind as the indices are gaining so quickly,&quot; a broker at a medium-sized brokerage said.</p>
<p>Blue-chip favourite Sony Corp hit a high for the calendar year of 9,300 yen but had retraced to stand flat at 9,240 at midday.  </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd analyst Takatoshi Yamamoto said that he saw Sony as a core issue for the electronics sector and that 10,000 yen was a goal for the share price.</p>
<p>Brokers said that the fall of the yen to a 127.16 in the morning, its lowest level since August 1992, was a plus for electronic and high-tech shares which are are exporters.</p>
<p>Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) was bid-only throughout the morning after Morgan Stanley Capital International said Wednesday that it had added NTT to its Japan index, effective after the market closing on May 30.  </p>
<p>Daiwa House Industry Co Ltd fell 90 yen to 1,330 on a newspaper report that its current profit is expected to shrink in the year to next March, traders said. Daiwa declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p>There were no sectors which posted major losses. Pulp/paper, sea transport, mining, banks and ceramics were at the top of the list of gaining sectors.</p>
