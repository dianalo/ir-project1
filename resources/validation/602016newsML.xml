<p>The Russia-NATO pact that President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin will sign in Paris next week in no way limits the security alliance's freedom of action, U.S. officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Briefing reporters ahead of Clinton's trip to Europe next week, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott left no doubt that the so-called NATO-Russia Founding Act would not tie the alliance's hands, even in any conflict with Russia itself.</p>
<p>Talbott said the act would create a NATO-Russia Joint Council that would operate by consensus but stressed that its decisions would not be binding on the North Atlantic Council (NAC) made up of NATO members that sets alliance policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The absence of a consensus in the NATO-Russia joint council does not in any way affect the freedom of action, the freedom of decision, either of NATO and the NAC or of Russia,&quot; he said. &quot;The NAC stands on its own, will continue to stand on its own, and the alliance, as such, will take its guidance from the NAC.&quot;</p>
<p>Talbott's explanation was the most explicit to date by a U.S. official on the agreement reached last Wednesday between Russia and the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.</p>
<p>Immediately after the agreement was announced, Yeltsin argued that it would give Moscow a veto over NATO decisions.</p>
<p>Talbott said the U.S. understanding was that Yeltsin was referring only to the new joint council to be set up rather than to the NAC, whose functioning remains unchanged.</p>
<p>National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, also briefing reporters, argued that if NATO were a slave to Russian wishes it would not be proceeding with its eastward expansion, a move Russia has vehemently opposed.</p>
<p>The alliance is expected to invite three countries -- the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland -- to join NATO at a summit this July in Madrid.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that in a sense the proof is in the pudding here in terms of NATO's willingness to act in its interest, even where...there may be a disagreement,&quot; Berger said.</p>
<p>Officials from each of the 16 NATO members, Yeltsin and the alliance Secretary General Javier Solana are expected to sign the document in Paris on Tuesday, a U.S. official said.</p>
<p>In addition to attending the signing, Clinton will mark the 50th anniversary of the Marshall Plan in the Netherlands on Wednesday and will meet new British Prime Minister Tony Blair in London on Thursday before returning to Washington.</p>
<p>Centred around the anniversary of the Marshall Plan, the U.S.-funded programme that helped rebuild Europe after the Second World War, the week's events will include a Clinton foreign policy speech on Saturday May 31 at the West Point military academy's graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>&quot;The president will talk directly to the American people about America's leadership responsibilities in Europe and in the world and explain why engagement in Europe and elsewhere remains vital to America's security and prosperity and why NATO, including enlargement, is the foundation for that engagement,&quot; Berger said.</p>
