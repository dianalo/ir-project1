<p>Lincoln National Corp may have a tough time finding a buyer for its American States Financial Corp unit, a company that some sources say is overvalued and has poor growth prospects.</p>
<p>Lincoln National on Wednesday confirmed that it was considering a possible sale of its 83 percent-owned American States property-casualty insurance business.</p>
<p>But Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Weston Hicks said the acquisition of American States at its current price would probably dilute the earnings of most potential buyers.  </p>
<p>Shares of American States rose 2-3/4, or nearly nine percent, to 35 in midafternoon trading.</p>
<p>The company currently has a market value of about $2.1 billion based on the share price and the number of shares outstanding.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the stock is fully valued here,&quot; Hicks said, saying he believed fair value for the shares was in the high $20 range.</p>
<p>&quot;I think somebody who buys it at an acquisition premium to 35, 36 dollars really has to have some tricks up their sleeve,&quot; Hicks said.  </p>
<p>Potential acquirors could include Travelers Property Casualty Corp and CNA Financial Corp, as well as some foreign buyers such as Zurich Insurance Co, Winterthur Insurance Co, Axa SA and Allianz AG Holding.</p>
<p>SAFECO Corp, which sources say had preliminary talks about buying the company over a year ago, also was previously rumored to be a possible buyer. SAFECO has declined comment.</p>
<p>Travelers and CNA also declined comment.  </p>
<p>Indeed, one source familiar with the situation said, &quot;to the best of my knowledge, none of the parties that were mentioned are seriously looking at this thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that American States may not offer much in the way of expense savings, he said, because the company has already been cutting costs for some time now.</p>
<p>The company also is in one of the most competitive property-casualty insurance markets, the commercial middle market, sources said.  </p>
<p>And then the stock is currently trading at around 1.5 time book value, which sources said was a bit rich, offering little hope for a premium.</p>
<p>&quot;Most healthy property-casualty mergers that have been done in recent years, the actual merger market value hasn't been that high,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Other comparable transactions were done at a median of 1.2 time book value and a mean of 1.6 times book, he said.</p>
<p>And with a market capitalization of about $2.1 billion, American States has a book value of about $1.3 billion, resulting in about $800 million in goodwill.  </p>
<p>But Lincoln National will be under pressure to do something or risk seeing the share price of American States backslide, another source said.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock has run up a lot and that is a problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However, he noted, PennCorp Financial Group Inc did not pay a premium for Washington National Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;If the seller doesn't do something, it's going to fall back to the old price,&quot; he said.</p>
