<headline>Deutsche management faces opposition at AGM.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-04-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Two small shareholders of Deutsche Bank AG plan to vote against the management at this year's annual general meeting partly because they believe the bank's image was harmed by a series of upsets, Deutsche said.</p>
<p>They have filed motions to block the formal exoneration of the management board because of Deutsche's controversial role in a hostile takeover bid which hit headlines last month and because of irregularities at its British unit Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Deutsche dismissed the accusations and said the motions had no chance of being accepted. The shareholders' meeting is on May 20.</p>
<p>One of the shareholders, Eduard Bernhard, plans to vote against the management due to &quot;unbelievable behaviour which damaged the company's reputation&quot;, according to his motion which Deutsche published on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bernhard referred to Deutsche's involvement in a takeover bid by steelmaker Krupp AG for Thyssen AG last month which prompted some 30,000 steelworkers to demonstrate outside the bank's Frankfurt headquarters accusing it of pursuing industrial policy at the expense of their livelihoods.</p>
<p>A second shareholder, Leonhard Knoll, said in his motion that &quot;barely a year passes in which Deutsche is not embroiled in highly publicised scandals&quot;.</p>
<p>He said 1996 was dominated by &quot;gigantic mistakes&quot; like the mismanagement of three funds at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) for which Deutsche has to pay compensation as well as a record two million-pound fine.</p>
<p>Knoll also criticised Deutsche for having to bail out engineering Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG last year in a rescue package which cost the bank about half a billion marks.</p>
<p>Deutsche responded in the statement that Krupp's takeover bid made strategic sense as was proven by the companies' merger of their steel business after the bid failed.</p>
<p>It also rejected criticism of the bank's management as unfounded.</p>
