<title>MEXICO: Mexico stocks end lower on battered peso.</title>

<p>Mexican stocks slumped on Friday as unease over the latest economic package and another speculative onslaught on the peso offset any potential benefit from earnings reports, traders said.</p>
<p>The blue chip IPC index closed down 45.93 points, or 1.40 percent, at 3,233.28 points.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso closed at its weakest level this year, at 7.9150/7.9250 per dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not that we disagree with the need for a revaluation of the peso, it's just that we did not expect it to slide so suddenly, and that makes us very nervous,&quot; said one trader.  </p>
<p>The Alliance for Economic Recovery (ARE), or &quot;pacto,&quot; is the latest in a series of economic packages thrashed out between government, business and labor leaders since 1987. The president's office said the ARE renewal was to be signed on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was very nervous over the peso slide and speculation was rife over the ARE,&quot; said Francisco Blanco, research director at the Arka brokerage.</p>
<p>Doubts concerned price and wage hikes, and tax breaks for industry contained in the ARE, and the consequent economic fallout, traders said.  </p>
<p>On the broad market, a total of 93 stocks changed hands, with losers outnumbering gainers by 67 to eight and 18 issues unchanged. Total volume was a paltry 55.3 million shares traded.</p>
<p>Mining firm Autrey headed percentage leaders, up 16 centavos to 7.10 pesos, after posting earnings during the session.</p>
<p>As on Thursday, financial stock GFInver dominated the percentage losers, following its takeover by Banco Santander. A hefty 8.7 million GFInver series BCP shares were traded, which fell 22 centavos to 65 centavos.  </p>
<p>Analysts said that fundamentals from earnings reports could restore the bourse's fortunes after uncertainty over the ARE subsides.</p>
<p>&quot;While it is true that jitters are not over, we think fundamentals are there, as well as good earnings reports, which ought to turn shift the balance in the market's favor,&quot; said Roberto Solano, deputy research director at the Estrategia Bursatil brokerage.</p>
<p>Blanco, for his part, noted that the IPC was now very close to its support at 3,220 points, and &quot;that tends to pave the way to an advance.&quot;</p>
