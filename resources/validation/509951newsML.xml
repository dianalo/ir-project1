<p>U.S. municipal bonds ended the day up 3/8 to 1/2 point enjoying the strength in the U.S. Treasury market.</p>
<p>Bond-friendly news on March consumer prices pushed U.S. Treasuries nearly a point higher at the end of the day. The benchmark 30-year bond was up 29/32 to yield 7.09 percent.</p>
<p>In the municipal market, high grade bonds were up an 03 to up an 05, depending on name and maturity, one municipal analyst said. Revenue bonds closed up 1/2.</p>
<p>Activity was moderate, although there were a few lists out for the bid. Rather than a lot of cash activity, some market players are focusing on bond swaps.</p>
<p>Overall, the market was firm.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a good day,&quot; said one market participant.</p>
<p>And new issue pricing was firm.</p>
<p>&quot;The secondary market has taken a backseat to the new issue market,&quot; said another participant.</p>
<p>Municipal bond sales for Wednesday, April 16 are expected to total $850 million in 27 sales, according to Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group.</p>
<p>Negotiated offerings total $793 million in nine sales, with a $197 million Metropolitan Transit Authority deal through Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc. topping the list.</p>
<p>On the competitive side, 18 sales totaling $57 million are on the schedule. A $22 million Oakland, Calif., at 1300 EDT is the largest.</p>
<p>An additional 14 sales totaling $301 million are on the possible calender, meaning underwriters have said they may price the bonds Wednesday, depending on market conditions.</p>
<p>In debt futures, the June municipal futures contract closed 112-19/32. The June T-bond contract closed at 20/32. The MOB spread closed 159 ticks, down from Monday's close of 163.</p>
