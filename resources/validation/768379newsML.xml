<p>Union Acceptance Corp said Thursday it expects fiscal year 1998 to be challenging but improved underwriting and collection policies should help results.</p>
<p>Earlier Union Acceptance said it had a net loss of $11.0 million, or $0.83 a share, in the fourth quarter ended June 30 compared with a profit of $5.5 million, or $0.41 a share, in the same period last year.</p>
<p>During the fourth quarter of this year, Union Acceptance posted an after-tax charge of $16.1 million, or $1.21 a share.  </p>
<p>The charge covered an increase in the allowance for estimated credit losses on securitized loans to a level deemed appropriate by the company, Union Acceptance said.</p>
<p>For the full year, the company earned $7.4 million, or $0.56 a share, versus earnings of $21.1 million, or $1.60 a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Although earnings for the year did not meet our expectations, I am proud of the company's performance in fiscal 1997. We increased our geographic presence to 29 states and had moderate growth in loan volume while tightening our credit standards. We will continue to grow our portfolio at a pace that is consistent with the desired level of credit quality and at a price that we believe delivers profits. Management has worked very hard over the past year to develop improved underwriting and collection policies designed to maximize profits and minimize credit losses. We face challenging times in this industry, and I expect that fiscal 1998 will present its own challenges, but UAC management is prepared to secure UAC's position in the industry over the long-term,&quot; John Stainbrook, Union Acceptance's president, said in a statement.</p>
