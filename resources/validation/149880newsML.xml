<p>Panic selling sent copper prices spiralling lower on Tuesday as a rally over the key $2,000/tonne level was pounded by speculators.</p>
<p>Prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) tumbled $100 as rumours swirled of huge sell orders by an influential Canadian player.</p>
<p>At the market's low point, it gave up all of last week's gains and lost five percent of its value, crushing the hopes of bulls who had counted on tight supplies to boost prices in the short term.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, however, copper prices for delivery in three months time edged above the lows to close $91 down at $1,925.</p>
<p>The weakness perplexed traders and analysts who point to heavy consumer demand and falling supplies.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a mystery to me what is going on. It does just not make sense at times,&quot; one senior trader said.</p>
<p>The market had been clawing higher for the past eight sessions, peaking at $2,042 on Monday, buoyed by dwindling inventories that hit six-year lows on Tuesday morning when stocks dropped by 13,475 tonnes.</p>
<p>Some senior traders believed that the initial heavy selling on Tuesday emanated from Canadian-based scrap metal dealer Herbie Black, which knocked market confidence.</p>
<p>Some of the investment funds which held weaker long positions then rushed to liquidate, triggering sell-stops as the market tumbled under various chart support levels.</p>
<p>Black is widely believed to be among those who broke Sumitomo Corp's control of the copper market, which former trader Yasuo Hamanaka is said to have exerted for many years.</p>
<p>Some traders believe former Sumitomo positions are still haunting the market as banks that took over the positions capitalise on price spikes to liquidate them.</p>
<p>&quot;Some positions must still be around from the Sumitomo scandal,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Prices got no support from comments by the chairman of the LME, the world's centre for trading in industrial metals, that there was no evidence of an artificial squeeze in copper stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no doubt that copper consumption is going extremely well,&quot; chairman Raj Bagri said in Tokyo at a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Some analysts had speculated that stocks were being moved around the global system -- in and out of bonded warehouses instead of being used by consumers -- to influence short-term price movement.</p>
<p>But a tangle of investigations by police and regulators in the wake of the Sumitomo copper affair would probably curb any ambitions of those who might have thought of manipulating the market, traders added.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody is going to play around with this market, not when all the regulators in the world are watching it,&quot; the senior trader said.</p>
