<p>Hong Kong's interim lawmaking chamber, picked by a China-controlled Selection Committee last week, has yet to find widespread acceptance in the territory, a recent survey found.</p>
<p>The survey, results of which were published by local media on Saturday, found 27.9 percent of respondents did not expect the new body to perform better than the existing elected legislature it is poised to replace upon the territory's return to China at midnight next June 30.</p>
<p>Only 15 percent expected a better performance.</p>
<p>The survey, which polled 592 people, was conducted on December 23 by the University of Hong Kong, two days after the provisional legislature was named in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>Up to 34.9 percent were dissatisfied with the selection process of the 60-member provisional legislature, but 31 percent approved, the survey showed.</p>
<p>About 38 percent regarded the body as unrepresentative, the survey said.</p>
<p>The Provisional Legislative Council, as it will be known, will meet informally for the first time next week and will sit from next July 1 until a new legislature can be elected. (Corrects to add dropped word &quot;informally&quot; and to make clear council will only sit from next July 1.)</p>
<p>Its low level of acceptance contrasts with that for chief executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa who saw a support rating of 65.3 percent after he was chosen on December 11 by the same committee to head Hong Kong from next July 1.</p>
<p>Governor Chris Patten has denounced China's plan to scrap the territory's present legislature. The United States has also called the planned move &quot;unjustified and unnecessary&quot;.</p>
<p>With just 185 days to the handover, the territory of 6.3 million is jittery over its future and whether China will hold to its promise of leaving it with a high degree of autonomy.</p>
<p>Elsie Tu, 83, member of the interim chamber, told the South China Morning Post on Saturday a China-picked Preparatory Committee, responsible for handling handover matters, would still wield considerable power after the handover.</p>
<p>&quot;The Preparatory Committee, as far as I see it, is...like a cabinet, and I think probably they would have the power to veto what the provisional legislature suggests,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Tu could not be immediately contacted for comment.</p>
