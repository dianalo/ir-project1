<p>Earnings at Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG, computer unit of the German electronics giant, should improve next year, but it is still far from making a big contribution to parent Siemens AG, analysts said.</p>
<p>Siemens Nixdorf (SNI) pre-tax earnings in the business year that ended on September 30 slipped 16 percent to 52 million marks, disappointing analysts who have been closely following the company's massive restructuring of the past few years.</p>
<p>Analysts said SNI could double profits next year, but from a base so low it will be barely noticeable in the grand scale of Siemens' overall operations with annual sales of 94.2 billion marks.</p>
<p>&quot;The profit numbers are much too small to have an impact,&quot; said Hans Peter Wodniok, a Credit Lyonnais analyst in Frankfurt. &quot;And it's not clear how well Siemens Nixdorf will do next year.&quot;</p>
<p>Analyst Peter Roe at Paribas Capital Markets in London forecast Siemens Nixdorf sale will rise four percent next year and profit will climb to 100 million marks.</p>
<p>Although it was profitable for the second consecutive year in the 1995/96 business year, the PC, mainframe and minicomputer maker fell short of its target of at least 10 percent sales growth.</p>
<p>The company made profits of 62 million marks in 1994/95 after years of huge losses followign the unit's formation after Siemens' 1990 take-over of Nixdorf.</p>
<p>However, last year's profit remained an anaemic 0.4 percent of sales. &quot;It was pretty disappointing,&quot; Wodniok said.</p>
<p>Improvement beyond that will be difficult because of the computer industry's thin margins, analysts said.</p>
<p>The PC market in particular will continue to trouble SNI because Germany's weak economy has dampened purchases by both home and business users.</p>
<p>&quot;If they maintain their PC market share next year, that would be a good result,&quot; Roe said.</p>
<p>In the first three quarters of 1996, the company's share of western European PC sales has hovered just above five percent, according to Context, a PC market researcher in London.</p>
<p>It trails Compaq Computer Corp., IBM and Hewlett Packard, which hold 13.1, 9.4 and 5.8 percent shares, respectively. HP and Dell Computer Corp., which has 4.9 percent, are also expanding their shares much faster than SNI.</p>
<p>SNI will break out its 1995-96 results at a news conference on Thursday. Last week, parent company Siemens said the unit's sales rose six percent to 13.6 billion marks and new orders climbed seven percent to 13.9 billion marks.</p>
<p>Siemens warned it expected no improvement in the group's results in 1996-97, and investor disappointment caused its shares to tumble seven percent to 73 marks on November 6, a level where they have languished ever since.</p>
<p>Siemens' semiconductor business reported less than half as much revenue as Siemens Nixdorf, but 10 times more profit -- 603 million marks on 4.8 billion in sales.</p>
