<title>JAPAN: Japan Telecom suffers lower profit after rate cuts.</title>

<p>Japanese long-distance telephone operator Japan Telecom Co Ltd reported lower half-year profits on Thursday as it failed to absorb the impact of rate cuts despite an expansion in its customer base.</p>
<p>Japan Telecom, however, said full-year profit would exceed its original forecast made in May because of planned restructuring measures in the second half.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of drastic rate cuts, we acquired more customers, and sales jumped 10 percent,&quot; Koichi Sakata, president of Japan Telecom, said in a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;But we couldn't fully absorb the adverse impact of the cuts on profits.&quot;</p>
<p>Japan Telecom said its parent current profit for the April to September period fell 5.8 percent to 22.06 billion yen ($198 million) over the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>It slashed long-distance call rates by around 20 percent in March 1996 and cut its rates on dedicated lines by 50 percent in October 1995 to keep up with rate cuts announced by its mammoth rival Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.</p>
<p>Japan Telecom, a newcomer to the market, holds about 23 percent of Japan's long-distance call market.</p>
<p>Sakata said the company plans to cut its sales costs and other expenses in a restructuring programme in the second half.</p>
<p>The company raised its full-year forecast for parent current profit -- which is before tax and includes extraordinary items -- to 43 billion yen ($387 million), up from the 39 billion yen ($351 million) projection made in May.</p>
<p>Analysts say a further upward revision in profits is likely later this year because of a planned reduction in access charges -- the fees Japan Telecom pays to NTT for using its local-call networks.</p>
<p>But part of the funds will be earmarked for more long-distance call rate cuts Japan Telecom plans for early next year. ($1=111 yen)</p>
