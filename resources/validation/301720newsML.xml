<p>Relatives of two British nurses charged with murdering an Australian colleague in Saudi Arabia visited them in prison on Sunday, a British official said.</p>
<p>A British Foreign Office spokesman said the relatives held separate two-hour meetings with the two nurses.</p>
<p>He said they visited them in prison with a lawyer representing the two, Michael Dark, and the British Consul, Lawson Ross, who delivered personal articles for the nurses.</p>
<p>Lucille McLauchlan, 31, and Deborah Parry, 41, were imprisoned in the eastern Saudi city of Dammam on December 20 and charged with murdering Yvonne Gilford, 55.</p>
<p>&quot;Both nurses appeared well and pleased to see their relatives,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He added that the relatives hoped to pay a further visit to the nurses on Tuesday.</p>
<p>McLauchlan's mother, staying at a Dammam hotel with her husband, refused to make any comments earlier in the day. &quot;We cannot talk, not today,&quot; she told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>Parry's brother-in-law and an uncle are also in Dammam, a British embassy official said.</p>
<p>The relatives, who arrived in the kingdom on Saturday, were not available for comment after the prison visit.</p>
<p>Under Islamic sharia law applied in the conservative kingdom, the two Britons could face public beheading if found guilty of premeditated murder by a panel of three judges.</p>
<p>The defendants have the right of appeal to two other five-judge panels before a final verdict is passed.</p>
<p>In the event of guilty verdicts, Gilford's family could spare the lives of the two British nurses and ask for financial settlement known as blood money instead of the death sentence.</p>
<p>But Gilford's family in Australia have ruled out a clemency appeal for the two.</p>
<p>Legal experts said that if found guilty of manslaughter the two would not receive a death sentence.</p>
<p>Gilford was stabbed four times and battered with a hammer and smothered in her dormitory at the King Fahd military medical complex in eastern Saudi Arabia on December 11.</p>
<p>Saudi police have said the two confessed to the murders and the confessions were filed with three judges.</p>
<p>But the law firm Salah al-Hejailan said last week after a visit to the two Britons that they withdrew their confessions and one of them retracted a statement that she had a lesbian relationship with the victim.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's Interior Minister Prince Nayef said earlier this month the two nurses would be granted their full rights under sharia law and the process would go through several judicial steps.</p>
<p>&quot;Under Islamic sharia law...a suspect should confess in front of a judge with all the details and the prosecutor should prove to the judicial authorities all the complete details that confirm the crime was committed...because confessing to a crime in front of investigators or the police is not enough,&quot; the official media quoted him as saying.</p>
