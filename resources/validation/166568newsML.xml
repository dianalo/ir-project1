<p>The dollar ended firmer against most major currencies along with U.S. stocks and bonds as traders bet Republicans will retain control of Congress even if President Clinton wins re-election, experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people truly believe that the Democrats will not take over Congress, and at the very worst, it'll be a split, and at the very best, the Republicans will maintain control of both houses,&quot; said Ben Strauss, an assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer and Co. Yet he warned, &quot;if that should for some reason not happen, I think we'll really see things crash overnight and tomorrow morning.&quot;</p>
<p>First results from Tuesdays elections are expected shortly after polls close at 1800 EST/2300 GMT in the states of Kentucky and Indiana. Fuller results will come after another seven eastern states close their polls at 1900 EST/midnight GMT.</p>
<p>The dollar ended at 114.20/25 yen and 1.5200/05 marks on Tuesday, up from 113.90/95 yen and 1.5130/40 at the open.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency also surged to 1.2810 Swiss francs, a new 20-month high. It closed at 1.2778/88 francs, up from 1.2728/38 at the open.</p>
<p>The dollar's stellar performance versus the Swiss currency also reflected, in part, relief that seven hours of open heart surgery performed Tuesday on Russian President Boris Yeltsin seemed successful.</p>
<p>Russian cardiologist Renat Akchurin, who led the surgical team, said Yeltsin should be fit enough in a few days to take back power from Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>&quot;As more and more of its safe haven role starts to diminish, then the question is why do you want to hold Swiss francs,&quot; said Diego Giurleo, vice president of Treasury at the Royal Bank of Canada.</p>
<p>Giurleo noted that low Swiss interest rates also make the currency less attractive.</p>
<p>Speculation that German official interest rates will remain low weighed on the mark after the Economic Ministry reported West German industrial orders tumbled 3.6 percent in September from the previous month. The weak German industrial data followed news of a decline in industrial output reported on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;As a minimum, anybody looking for a rate hike in Germany, that concern has to be pushed off further in the future,&quot; said Ron Leven, a currency strategist at J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>While the dollar bested most major currencies, it lost ground to the Canadian dollar, which strengthened to its best level in 13 months.</p>
<p>The Canadian currency gained partly as the Canadian bond maket outperformed United States bonds, according to Anne Pankowski, a director of foreign exchange at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.</p>
<p>The dollar closed at Canadian $1.3308/13, down from C$1.3357/62 at the open. Sterling fell to $1.6455/65 from $1.6515/25. The Australian dollar closed at $0.7867/72, little changed from $0.7865/70 at the open.</p>
