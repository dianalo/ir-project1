<p>The U.S. Treasury has given a Minneapolis firm permission to export 500,000 tonnes of food to famine-struck North Korea, a U.S. official said on Monday, a week after the communist nation apologised for a submarine incursion into South Korean waters.</p>
<p>The Treasury granted a license to Minneapolis-based Cargill Inc., a giant grain company that received the first authorisation to barter grain with North Korea in years. The step was viewed by analysts on Monday as a warming in relations between the Stalinist nation and the United States.</p>
<p>Only a handful of U.S. license have allowed food sales to communist North Korea and none recently, a Treasury official said.</p>
<p>Cargill, which applied last September for the license, said on Monday it allowed sale of wheat and rice.</p>
<p>Some grain-trade sources were sceptical a deal would be struck with Pyongyang, which was believed to have little money for direct food purchases. Barters are difficult to arrange and can be risky financially, they said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the license for Cargill seemed enmeshed in efforts to rein in North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons programme and to ease military tension on the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>The (U.S.) State Department said it hoped North Korea's apology would lead to action on several issues involving North Korea.</p>
<p>While Cargill said its license was issued on Dec. 30, the day after North Korea apologised, U.S. officials did not confirm the approval until Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the license) is significant in the sense that the United States has had a trade embargo&quot; with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a Georgetown University professor who specialises in East Asian and Korean issues.</p>
<p>The United States has moved slowly on normalising relations with North Korea.</p>
<p>North Korea suffered two years of flooding that depleted its food supplies and left its citizens short of food. The United States gave $2 million in February 1996 to alleviate famine.</p>
<p>Buying all the grain authorised by the Cargill license could easily cost $100 million, based on U.S. prices and shipping costs. Grain analysts said high U.S. prices might force Cargill to fill an order with grain from other nations.</p>
<p>Despite its food problems North Korea is a producer of coal, iron ore, magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead and precious metals. It exports some minerals and metallurgical products.</p>
<p>Along with being one of the world's leading grain traders, Cargill is active in all major commodities, including metals, so-called soft commodites, meats, salt and others.</p>
<p>Cha said zinc, a widely traded metal, might be of interest for a barter. North Korea &quot;could be of longer interest,&quot; to Cargill, he said, &quot;just getting market access.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States has said it regards North Korea's nuclear programme as one of the major threats to peace in East Asia.</p>
