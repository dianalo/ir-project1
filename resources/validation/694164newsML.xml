<p>Ninety-two countries have signed the Declaration of Brussels preparing a first-ever landmine ban treaty to be signed in Ottawa, Canada in December, diplomats at a Brussels conference told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>The organisers of the four-day Conference on a Global Ban on Anti-personnel Mines were due to make a formal statement about the number of countries who have signed the Brussels Declaration at the conference's closing news conference later today.</p>
<p>The signatories include African, central American and some Asian countries as well as all European Union nations with the exception of Greece and Finland.</p>
<p>Greece refuses to sign because of territorial disputes with Turkey while Finland refuses because of its long border with Russia.</p>
<p>A total of 115 countries have been taking part in the Brussels talks. Signature of the Brussels Declaration was a pre-condition for countries to be allowed to join talks in Oslo, Norway, in September where the exact wording of the Ottawa treaty will be negotiated.</p>
<p>Thirty-six other delegations took part in the Brussels talks as observers. They included Cuba, Greece, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Libya, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority, Turkey and the United States.</p>
<p>Russia and China, the main producers of landmines, did not take part in the negotiations at all.</p>
<p>The landmine talks, which started in Ottawa at the end of 1996, are set to lead to the signing of the first-ever treaty to ban the production, use, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel landmines.</p>
<p>The United States will not sign because it favours separate United Nations-sponsored landmine talks in Geneva.</p>
<p>The Geneva Conference on Disarmament, which requires consensus, is not expected to produce a landmine ban for some years. However, it appointed a special co-ordinator on the subject on Thursday, signalling agreement by Third World states that it be tackled on its own and no longer tied to deadlocked nuclear topics.</p>
<p>The International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), the main anti-mine lobby group, backed by over 1,000 non-governmental organisations, has severely criticised the United States' efforts to undermine the Ottawa Process.</p>
<p>It said on Thursday that the United States, Greece and Turkey stod as the only NATO countries not on board the Ottawa talks.</p>
