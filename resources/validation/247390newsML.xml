<p>Despite intensive Franco-German efforts to present a united front, a yawning &quot;culture gap&quot; has opened in public debate in France and Germany on the future of the European Union and its planned single currency.</p>
<p>That gap is making it harder for Paris and Bonn to forge common positions on the details of EU economic and monetary union, although the political will on both sides remains strong.</p>
<p>President Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Helmut Kohl tried to bridge the divide in Nuremberg on Monday, issuing joint proposals for EU reform ahead of Friday's Dublin summit and adopting a common defence concept.</p>
<p>But their reassuring words and displays of warmth could not mask differing public attitudes towards the future currency and European economic policy, which are increasingly reflected in discordant comments by government leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;We are like lovers climbing into the same bed with different dreams,&quot; a French diplomat quipped in Nuremberg.</p>
<p>The core of the problem is the role of a future independent European central bank and its relationship with governments.</p>
<p>The French, with a tradition of state economic intervention dating back to King Louis XIV's 17th century minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, insist that elected governments must continue to play the determining role in economic policy.</p>
<p>In their eyes, that includes setting the euro's exchange rate against the dollar and framing policies to promote growth and job-creation.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want all decisions on economic, budgetary, fiscal and monetary policy to be shaped by a technocratic, automatic system under the sole authority of the European Central Bank. That is not our concept of democracy,&quot; Prime Minister Alain Juppe told the Financial Times in a weekend interview.</p>
<p>France is pushing for something the government calls an &quot;economic government of Europe&quot; at home or a &quot;stability council&quot; abroad as a political counterweight to the central bank.</p>
<p>The Germans, who trace their postwar economic miracle to the success of a strong deutschemark guaranteed by an independent central bank, are wary of any government economic intervention and argue that the euro must be as strong as the mark.</p>
<p>The hyper-inflation of the 1920s, which stripped millions of Germans of their savings and helped bring Hitler to power, is Germany's biggest nightmare. The French are more afraid of recession and mass employment than of inflation and devaluation, with which they lived happily until the early 1980s.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a clash of different philosophies and cultures, based on the very different paths we have taken in Europe,&quot; said Werner Hoyer, Germany's top European negotiator.</p>
<p>In France, a significant group of Eurosceptics, many of them in Chirac's conservative Gaullist party, believe sluggish French growth and record 12.6 percent unemployment can be blamed partly on the pegging of the franc to the mark since the late 1980s.</p>
<p>They gained a major ally last month when ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, co-father of the European Monetary System, called for a depreciation of the franc to boost growth and create jobs, drawing a sharp government rebuttal.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it was briefly fashionable in Paris to talk of &quot;deflation&quot;, with consumer spending and prices falling for consecutive months amid stagnating growth.</p>
<p>Yet economists dismiss talk of deflation as alarmist and most say the franc is not overvalued against the mark, although both currencies may be too strong against the dollar.</p>
<p>They point to a French trade surplus with Bonn, lower unit labour costs in France and long-term interest rates at a record low, nearly identical to Germany's.</p>
<p>However, some French politicians find it easier to blame their country's economic gloom on a perceived German hegemony than on sensitive domestic problems such as heavy labour market regulation that makes hiring and firing difficult or the 6,000-franc ($1,200) a month national minimum wage.</p>
