<p>The British government announced tough measures on Thursday aimed at curbing teenage alcohol consumption backed up by a stricter code of practice from the industry watchdog.</p>
<p>The government measures are a response to the meteoric rise of so-called &quot;alcopops&quot; -- alcoholic lemonades and sodas -- which have appealed in their marketing and labelling to under-age drinkers.</p>
<p>The drinks have proved a runaway success for the industry. Sales now exceed 250 million pounds ($419.3 million) a year and it is now the fastest growing sector in the drinks industry.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to see progress on the ground otherwise we will take further action. It is now for the industry to show this can work in stamping out underage drinking,&quot; Interior Minister George Howarth told a news conference.</p>
<p>The government proposed making it an offence for adults to buy alcohol for a juvenile, bringing English and Welsh law in line with Scottish law.</p>
<p>It also proposed allowing police to confiscate alcohol from those under-18 drinking in public and using teenagers, working under close police supervision, to check rogue retailers selling alcohol to under-18s.</p>
<p>&quot;Alcopops were a very cynical attempt to snare people at a very early age,&quot; said Howarth, who welcomed the new code of practice set out on Thursday by the Portman Group's (the industry watchdog).</p>
<p>Howarth said the government measures could only be made to work with the support of retailers and the industry.</p>
<p>He could not give a firm commitment on the timetable for any legislation but said the first measure -- police confiscating alcohol -- will be enforceable by August.</p>
<p>Brewing-to-leisure group Bass Plc, which brews the nations most popular alcopop Hooper's Hooch, welcomed the proposals.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way to address under-age drinking is to stop the sale of alcohol to under 18s. A fact which the government has acknowledged in this announcement,&quot; a company spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;By promoting proof of age cards and making it illegal to buy alcohol for under 18s the government has acted positively and focused on the supply of alcohol rather than simply targeting the legal production of legitimate drinks,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Other alcopop brands include Two Dogs made by Merrydown Plc and Whitbread Plc's Vanilla Heist and Lemon Jag. Supermarkets also now have their own label brands.</p>
<p>There were fears in the brewing and retail industry that the government would ban alcopops after Home Secretary Jack Straw announced an urgent inquiry into the fizzy drinks in May.</p>
<p>The industry code, drawn up by the Portman Group, a self-regulatory watchdog funded by seven major manufacturers, will cover all drinks over 0.5 percent alcohol by volume.</p>
<p>It will tighten restrictions on the packaging and labelling of drinks to ensure they do not appeal especially to under 18 year olds.</p>
<p>That means banning references to illegal drugs, linking a drink with sexual prowess or success, using images of people under 25 or look as if they are under 25 and using artificially-bright colours or child-like lettering.</p>
<p>The colour, taste and texture of a drink will also be taken into account by the Independent Complaints Panel, said the group in a statement.</p>
<p>Retailers will be asked not to stock those products if a complaint is upheld, and local licensing authorities may take action against shop keepers who fail to respond.</p>
<p>Portman Group director Jean Coussins said manufacturers and retailers who ignore the code &quot;will pay a high price, socially and commercially&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The vast majority of the drinks industry has already shown its strong commitment to the code.</p>
<p>&quot;The new enforcement measures are designed to ensure that offending products are squeezed out of the market,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Top selling &quot;alcopops&quot; are more than five percent alcohol by volume and the choice of flavours available is growing. In January the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the market leader Hooper's Hooch, brewed by Bass Plc should drop a cartoon character of a smiley lemon from its logo and change the bottle's design after complaints.</p>
