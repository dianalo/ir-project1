<p>Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri left Beirut on Friday for a &quot;Friends of Lebanon&quot; donors conference in Washington, seeking $5 billion over the next five years to help him carry on rebuilding the country.</p>
<p>About 30 countries are expected at the meeting that the United States agreed to sponsor last April after a 17-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon that hurt its economy and set back its multi-billion dollar reconstruction drive.</p>
<p>Hariri, who has gotten Lebanon's postwar reconstruction off to a flying start in the past four years, will present the December 16 conference with 31 infrastructure projects that his cash-strapped government considers high priority but cannot afford to undertake.</p>
<p>They range from road-building and water projects to education and the environment, and Lebanon hopes donor governments will choose projects, pledge grants and soft loans and get their own private sectors involved in the execution.</p>
<p>Hariri also hopes donor states will provide $1 billion in credit guarantee facilities to reduce the cost of supplementary borrowing for Lebanon on the international markets.</p>
<p>The conference will be followed by a meeting of 60 Lebanese private sector executives with businessmen from the United States and other countries who might be interested in undertaking projects or investing in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Lebanese officials and diplomats in Beirut indicate that the target of donor pledges totalling $1 billion a year for five years is unlikely to be achieved.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador David Jones has said $800 million would be an attainable figure. Hariri himself has increasingly emphasised the political significance of the conference over its likely financial returns.</p>
<p>&quot;Holding the conference is in itself an important achievement and provides evidence of the United States' desire to support Lebanon's reconstruction and its return to economic well-being,&quot; Hariri said before leaving for Washington.</p>
<p>Lebanese officials also express guarded hopes that Washington may use the conference as the occasion to announce some easing of its 11-year-old ban on U.S. citizens travelling to Washington.</p>
<p>Lebanon has had disappointing experiences with previous donor conferences that pledged large sums that never materialised, but Beirut officials say things should be different this time because Lebanon has made a huge effort to rebuild.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that what has changed this time is that...the world has seen that there is a certain minimum degree of seriousness and that the Lebanese are doing their part of the job,&quot; acting finance minister Fouad Siniora told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;What we have already achieved in terms of economic, financial, security and social stability is a good incentive for friendly countries to help Lebanon make it all more sustainable,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Donors and official lenders have supported Lebanon's reconstruction over the past four years at an annual rate of $750 million, but the government has run up huge budget deficits and debt to keep the programme going.</p>
<p>The billionaire prime minister was the brain behind Solidere, Lebanon's biggest company, which is rebuilding central Beirut. The tycoon has a $125 million stake in the company.</p>
