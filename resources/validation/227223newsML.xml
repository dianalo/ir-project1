<p>Australia's race debate has had no effect on the number of people seeking to move to Australia because the government's stand against racism was well known, Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Ruddock said the anti-racist views held by both sides of Australian politics and expressed in a parliamentary declaration in October were well understood.</p>
<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad on Saturday also appeared to accept that the views of controversial parliamentarian Pauline Hanson did not reflect the official view.</p>
<p>Hanson sparked a passionate national debate on race and immigration with a maiden parliamentary speech earlier this year warning Australia was being swamped by Asians. She also criticised government assistance for Aborigines.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it (the Australian race debate) was started by a person of no consequence who has probably never seen other people behave nicely towards her so she makes these nasty comments,&quot; he told reporters in Jakarta.</p>
<p>Ruddock said Canberra's position was clear.</p>
<p>&quot;The resolution that was passed in the parliament, the large number of questions answered by the prime minister (John Howard), the statements I've made, the statements that my parliamentary colleagues have made are unambiguous and clear,&quot; he said. &quot;Our approach is non-discriminatory.&quot;</p>
<p>Ruddock noted that the number of visitors from South Korea was up 40 percent in October compared to the year-earlier figure.</p>
<p>&quot;So it is fairly hard to suggest that at this stage, in relation to those areas where economic activity is involved, that we have suffered as a result of the discussion that has taken place,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hanson, ejected from the ruling Liberal-National coalition before the March election, is a pariah in Canberra and receives sympathetic treatment from neither politicians nor the media.</p>
<p>But senior Australian politicians, far more restrained in their language since the departure this year of straight-talking former prime minister Paul Keating, have not gone has far as Mahathir in dismissing her.</p>
<p>Howard in particular has been criticised for being too slow to condemn her, although he argues that, as prime minister, he is above responding to every view expressed by minority politicians.</p>
<p>Public opinion polls show up to two-thirds of Australians back her opposition to immigration, but not necessarily her other views.</p>
<p>Ruddock said immigration department figures showed she had had no significant effect among intending immigrants, if any.</p>
<p>&quot;I accept that at face value, the sort of debate we've had can be counterproductive,&quot; he told Ten Network television.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is no hard evidence at this stage that would suggest that what has occurred has had a significant impact in the numbers of people seeking to access Australia.&quot;</p>
<p>Overall numbers of intending immigrants had risen, he said.</p>
<p>The upper house of the Australian parliament, the Senate, last week rejected new government legislation that would have largely denied social security to immigrants for two years after their arrival.</p>
<p>Minority politicians, voting against the legislation, accused Howard's administration of taking a racist attitude.</p>
<p>However, the government says the policy of granting social security to people as soon as they arrive is too generous and out of step with other countries.</p>
<p>The measure was announced as part of the August budget's attack on public spending.</p>
