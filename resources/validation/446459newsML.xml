<headline>UK's Major picks key economic week to set election.</headline>

<p>British Prime Minister John Major chose a prize week to announce the election date, with key economic statistics likely to show unemployment tumbling, inflation in check and the public finances improving rapidly.</p>
<p>Major on Monday ended weeks of speculation by announcing that the election will be held on May 1.</p>
<p>In timing his announcement, economists said he is likely to have been highly conscious of the possible electoral impact of this week's statistics, especially February unemployment data on Wednesday and inflation data on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of the economy, it couldn't be much better for the Conservatives,&quot; said Andrew Cates, UK economist at UBS.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures should show another healthy fall in unemployment, encouraging news on inflation, a small rise in retail sales and public borrowing set to undershoot the official forecast.&quot;</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics starts off the week's releases on Tuesday with figures for the public sector borrowing requirement (budget deficit) in February.</p>
<p>These are expected to show that the government is likely to undershoot its target of 26.5 billion pounds ($42.4 billion) for the financial year to April 5.</p>
<p>&quot;The two key releases of the week are the jobs and prices figures,&quot; said David Philpotts, UK economist at Schroders.</p>
<p>&quot;Another significant fall in unemployment will be a very good backdrop for the election campaign and the big falls in the jobless total seen over the last year are certain to be mentioned more than once.&quot;</p>
<p>Major's Conservatives are around 20 points behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls, but they believe the economy is their strongest suit and plan to campaign heavily on the success of their economic policies.</p>
<p>If the data come in as expected, the Conservatives will be able to boast their policies have secured an exemplary economic recovery, combining steady growth with low inflation and falling unemployment.</p>
<p>The Reuters consensus of forecasts by City economists suggests unemployment will show a fall of 39,000 in February. In January, it fell by 68,000 and the jobless total hit a six-year low of 1.8 million.</p>
<p>Retail prices data on Thursday are expected to show headline inflation stuck at 2.8 percent for the second month in a row, but the underlying inflation rate could slip to 2.9 percent from 3.1 percent in January.</p>
<p>This is good by historical standards in Britain but still above the target for underlying inflation of 2.5 percent set by the Conservatives and also adopted by the Labour party.</p>
<p>Philpotts said the only possible fly in the statistical ointment could be retail sales data due Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Anecdotal and survey evidence suggests only a very small rise in high street sales of around 0.1 percent. That would be a disappointing figure for candidates to take on the campaign trail,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Cates said slower higher street sales would allow Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) Kenneth Clarke to counter claims that he has been reckless in leaving interest rates unchanged at six percent despite evidence of escalating consumer spending.</p>
<p>&quot;Slower retail sales growth may prevent the government boasting about consumer confidence, but it will mean no finger wagging at the Chancellor for leaving rates on hold.&quot;</p>
<p>Clarke has won respect in the City for his handling of the economy since he became Chancellor in May 1993.</p>
<p>But some economists suspect he may have resisted the Bank of England's advice to raise interest rates in the last few months for political rather than economic reasons.</p>
<p>The problem for Major is that Britain's undoubted economic recovery has yet to be felt in the opinion polls.</p>
<p>&quot;The economic figures have been good for two years now, but the relationship between consumer confidence and the government's standing in the polls has broken down, so the economic figures may not actually help the Conservatives at all,&quot; Cates said. ($ = 0.624 British Pounds)</p>
