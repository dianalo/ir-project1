<p>The ruling Conservatives accused Labour leader Tony Blair of &quot;despicable lies&quot; on Thursday as Britain's election battle reached new heights of rancour just a week ahead of polling on May 1.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything he says, every twist he makes, every word he speaks is a deliberate deception planned months and months ago to divert attention from the real issues,&quot; Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;The tougher the questioning, the more he panics. The more he panics, the more he lies -- bare-faced, despicable lies.&quot;</p>
<p>Labour spokesmen said Dorrell's blunt language reflected the desperate plight of the party which has ruled Britain since 1979 but whose internal divisions over Europe and broken pledges not to raise taxes have alienated voters.</p>
<p>As new opinion polls put it some 20 points adrift of Labour, bookmakers quoted Labour at 1-5 on to win an overall majority of the 659 seats at stake, with the Conservatives at 13-2.</p>
<p>&quot;The country's rumbled you, they've found you out, and they don't want any more of you,&quot; Blair told Conservative supporters who heckled him during a campaign speech in south London.</p>
<p>&quot;You have had 18 years to put this country right, and we say 18 years is enough -- go.&quot;</p>
<p>Dorrell's assault on Blair followed claims he made that if the Conservatives won, they would abolish the state pension.</p>
<p>The Conservatives recently proposed a scheme under which younger Britons could earn themselves a more comfortable old age by investing money which at present goes to the national insurance fund in private pension schemes.</p>
<p>But Dorrell insisted the scheme had a secure safety net which would guarantee the basic state pension even to those unlucky enough to invest in schemes which failed.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Blair) has resorted to hysterical scares. He knows full well that the Conservatives have given a cast iron guarantee of the basic state pension,&quot; Dorrell said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major earlier said Labour was proposing &quot;to fill the last week of the election frightening the sick, the elderly and the vulnerable by spreading deliberate fibs and scare stories they know we have denied&quot;.</p>
<p>The tougher tone of Conservative rhetoric follows five weeks of campaigning in which the party has inflicted few telling blows on Blair, who has gradually moved his party to the centre ground, narrowing the policy gulf between the two sides.</p>
<p>&quot;The campaign has done little or nothing to change the public mood,&quot; poll analyst Peter Kellner wrote in Thursday's London Evening Standard.</p>
<p>&quot;The typical middle-Britain voter is mildly fearful of a Blair administration -- but terrified of five more years of Conservative rule.&quot;</p>
<p>The Conservatives' task in overturning Labour's lead was made more difficult when the powerful anti-gun lobby, the Gun Control Network, urged supporters to vote against the party.</p>
<p>It said while the vast majority of Labour and minority Liberal Democrat candidates backed a total ban on handguns following last year's Dunblane tragedy when a loner shot dead 16 young children, fewer than three in 10 Conservatives did so.</p>
<p>Major, at his daily news conference, appealed to voters to give his government credit for Britain's low inflation and falling employment and said Labour's itch to raise taxes risked derailing the economic recovery.</p>
<p>The prime minister said Labour had a &quot;black hole&quot; in its spending plans of 12 billion pounds ($19 billion) that would have to be filled by raising taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour must level with the British people, tell the truth about what they would do,&quot; said finance minister Kenneth Clarke.</p>
