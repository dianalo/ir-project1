<p>Chilean blue chips closed sharply lower with the bolsa pulled down by a slide in the Enersis group which had rallied last week ahead of a deal with Spanish utility Endesa, said traders.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected the bourse to find its footing at the opening and could end the day slightly firmer, unless the Enersis group suffer a further price correction.</p>
<p>The 40-share  .IPSA index ended unofficially down 1.39 percent at 134.01 points. The general  .IGPA index slipped 0.9 percent to 5,691.83 points amid turnover of 14 billion pesos.  </p>
<p>Traders noted a sharp fall in the Chispa group of companies, which control Enersis, as speculators sold stock following the announcement in the media of the terms of Endesa's offer for these stocks.</p>
<p>Speculators sold the Chispas once they realized that Endesa would stick to its position of only buying shares owned by investors on May 30, they said.</p>
<p>Enersis and subsidiary Endesa lost ground on a wave of sell orders in New York in late afternoon trade, said brokers.  </p>
<p>&quot;People are still analyzing to see what the Endesa deal means for Enersis now the position with the Chispas is clear,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Enersis slumped 2.24 percent to 305 pesos, while Endesa shed 2.45 percent to 319 pesos.</p>
<p>Winners included drug-maker LabChile, up 1.59 percent at 640 pesos and Banco Edwards which firmed 1.48 percent to 52 pesos.</p>
