<headline>Turkish Tofas says export orders fell in Sept.</headline>

<p>Turkey's leading car maker Tofas Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi A.S. said its export orders fell significantly since the start of September in comparison to previous months.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to the Istanbul Stock Exchange, Tofas, owned equally by Italy's Fiat Auto SpA and Turkey's leading industrial conglomerate Koc Holding, blamed competition from Fiat's new model Marea for the drop, but gave no figures.</p>
<p>Tofas, the sole producer of Fiat's Tempra model since March 1995, has been exporting Tempras for Fiat. It said the export agreement with Fiat would end on December 31, 1996.</p>
<p>Tofas's car output was 71,393 and total exports were 27,437 in the first eight months of this year when its domestic sales reached 51,446 cars.</p>
<p>Exports peaked in March with 5,333 cars and hit the lowest in May with 2,017. Egypt has been the largest importer with 11,069 cars, followed by Italy with 9,887 in January-August.</p>
<p>Tofas said only 40 percent of the annual production capacity was utilised despite the exports, adding that this figure would go even lower if a government plan to ease car imports went ahead.</p>
<p>Turkish goverment is studying a plan to ease car import rules for Turkish workers abroad who open a minimum 50,000 mark, one-year savings account in Turkey in a move to raise funds as part of two revenue-raising packages unveiled to fight the deficits.</p>
<p>The workers will be able to bring cars with a maximum age of four years to Turkey without paying customs duties.</p>
<p>The government said the workers who open the one-year accounts will also benefit from a 20 percent reduction in taxes when buying domestic cars.</p>
<p>Tofas said a project to locally produce Palio model cars has been postponed in the face of high development costs and weak domestic demand, continuing since Turkey's 1994 economic crisis as well as the government plan to allow more car imports. -- Istanbul Newsroom +90-212-2750875</p>
