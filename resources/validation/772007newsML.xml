<p>Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea on Friday  kept Romania's state-owned oil company (CRP) afloat for two more weeks  pending elaboration of a plan to scale down the bloated oil sector  acceptable to international lenders.</p>
<p>Ciorbea said his centrist cabinet, examining revision of the 1997  budget to meet IMF demands, was considering three plans to replace  the CRP with a leaner structure to cut the country's 33 million-tonne  annual refining capacity.</p>
<p>An International Monetary Fund mission is in Bucharest examining Romania's  success in implementing reforms.</p>
<p>The CRP, the Romanian Oil Company, was set up a year ago by a leftist  government voted out of office only months later.</p>
<p>Accused of accumulating big losses and failing to undertake restructuring,  it had been due to close down on Friday. But no agreement was reached  in time on how to replace it.</p>
<p>&quot;I propose that we postpone for 15 days the restructuring of this  company,&quot; Ciorbea told reporters before the meeting.</p>
<p>Media reports said a plan backed by the World Bank would maintain  only one of Romania's 11 refineries within the new company, to be  known as the National Oil Company (SNP).</p>
<p>A second plan, said to be proposed by the European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development (EBRD) favoured keeping two refineries within the  state-owned firm and a third on contract.</p>
<p>Ciorbea said a third proposal would keep two refineries within the  company and proceed with privatisation of others.</p>
<p>Before the prime minister's announcement, Trade and Industry Minister  Calin Popescu Tariceanu threatened to quit unless plans were adopted  quickly to overhaul the industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Plans for the future company have been in preparation for more than  two months but they haven't taken shape,&quot; Tariceanu said on television  late on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very concerned about this. I have no intention of resigning  now but I'm prepared to do so if I cannot push through my plans.&quot;</p>
<p>Tariceanu said refining capacity had to be cut to the level of annual  domestic consumption of about 10 million tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;The IMF does not want to see unviable oil companies operating at  a loss,&quot; he said. &quot;We must take decisions on what we want to do.&quot;</p>
<p>The State Ownership Fund was to have announced on Friday plans to  privatise one of the refineries, Petromidia on the Black Sea coast,  but it postponed the decision for a week, saying documentation was  insufficent. Seven firms have submitted bids.</p>
