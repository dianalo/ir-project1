<title>UK: CRICKET-RUSSELL NOT TO BE PUNISHED OVER HIS BOOK.</title>
<headline>CRICKET-RUSSELL NOT TO BE PUNISHED OVER HIS BOOK.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>England wicketkeeper Jack Russell is not to be punished by his country's cricket authorities over the publication of his forthcoming controversial autobiography.</p>
<p>Russell upset the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) by refusing to make any changes to the text ahead of a serialisation in a British newspaper this week and publication of the book on May 19.</p>
<p>The book contains criticism of former chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth and current England captain Mike Atherton, but is also considered fair comment from a respected Gloucestershire player.</p>
<p>However, after referral to ECB discipline committee chairman Gerard Elias QC, the authorities have clearly opted to let the matter rest in a bid to dissolve the furore surrounding the book.</p>
<p>Elias said in a statement on Friday: &quot;Jack Russell had provided the Board with a copy of his book in March, albeit at a late stage before proposed publication, and in the circumstances the Board is not disposed to take any action over the question of the application for prior approval of the text.</p>
<p>&quot;In relation to these extracts actually published I have no present intention of recommending that any disciplinary proceedings be taken.&quot;</p>
