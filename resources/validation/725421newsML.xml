<p>Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic on Monday rejected peace overtures from nationalist hardliners vying with her for power and accused them of trying to usurp the constitution.</p>
<p>She told reporters after a meeting with nationalist rival Momcilo Krajisnik she would continue her crusade against government corruption and to &quot;establish a state ruled by law&quot;.</p>
<p>Plavsic is trying to dissolve the Bosnian Serb parliament to reduce the influence of ultra-nationalists led by former president and indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic, who has continued to wield power since being driven from public office last year by the international community.</p>
<p>Krajisnik, negotiating on Karadzic's behalf, said he had offered to halt efforts to wrest power from her if she would rescind parliament's dissolution.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not need a victor or a loser because concord and unity are the most important today,&quot; Krajisnik told reporters.</p>
<p>Plavsic said she told him there could be &quot;no compromise on principles&quot; and added: &quot;Crime is flourishing in the Bosnian Serb republic&quot;.</p>
<p>She has accused Karadzic and Krajisnik and Interior Minister Dragan Kijac of using the Bosnian Serb police and state companies to traffic in smuggled cigarettes and alcohol.</p>
<p>In a televised speech later on Monday, Plavsic showed no sign she was ready to back down and vowed to keep up her campaign against corruption.</p>
<p>&quot;What kind of prospects does a nation have, especially its youth, when crime is so deeply rooted in our republic?&quot; Plavsic said.</p>
<p>She said a &quot;very narrow group of people&quot; in Karadzic's ruling party were trying to retain power without any respect for the law.</p>
<p>&quot;The state is not a private company,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Bosnian Serb constitutional court, which is under the hardliners' control, has suspended the dissolution but has still to make a final ruling on the legality of Plavsic's actions.</p>
<p>A European Union team of legal experts issued an opinion on Monday saying that Plavsic's decision to dissolve the parliament was constitutional and that government hardliners had no legal grounds to cancel it.</p>
<p>In a statement released in Sarajevo, the European Commission for Democracy through Law also said that Plavsic had the right to form a new government after a newly-elected parliament was formed. Plavsic has called for a general election on September 1.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the existing government remains legitimate, the EU experts said.</p>
<p>Under a 1995 peace agreement, Bosnia is divided into autonomous Serb and Moslem-Croat entities governed by a central inter-ethnic presidency, cabinet and parliament.</p>
