<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto asked parliament on Thursday to approve a bill to extend leases on land for U.S. military bases on the restive southern island of Okinawa.</p>
<p>Hashimoto said he needs the authority to meet a May 14 deadline on expiry of leases on private land used for U.S. military facilities on Okinawa, where 75 percent of such installations in Japan are located.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a responsibility to provide bases and facilities for the U.S. military as part of the Japanese government's obligation under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty,&quot; Hashimoto told parliament.</p>
<p>At stake are plots of land owned by 3,000 anti-bases activists who are refusing to renew the contracts. Another 29,000 landowners have agreed to renew their leases.</p>
<p>The contracts in question are mostly for small plots totalling some 36 hectares (89 acres) on which 12 bases are located.</p>
<p>Without revising an existing law on land expropriation, the government would be illegally occupying the land. The legislation will give the  government a temporary extension of its leases after current contracts expire.</p>
<p>Hashimoto's move drew sharp criticism from officials in Okinawa, which has long resented its role as host to about half of the 40,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan.</p>
<p>&quot;To ask Okinawa to peacefully coexist with the U.S. bases after its society has been undermined by that very presence is too cruel,&quot; said Kosei Oyadomari, mayor of the Okinawan capital of Naha.</p>
<p>Although Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lacks a majority in parliament, the bill was expected to be passed with the help of small parties and some independent and opposition legislators.</p>
<p>A row between the central and Okinawan governments over U.S. bases flared up in September 1995 when three U.S. servicemen were arrested for the rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl. They are now serving prison terms.</p>
<p>The concentration of U.S. military facilities on Okinawa is a legacy of the U.S. military occupation of the island between 1945 and 1972. Private land for U.S. bases is expropriated by the Japanese government, not the U.S. military itself.</p>
<p>The U.S military's image in Japan suffered a fresh blow on Wednesday with the arrest of a U.S. sailor at the headquarters base of the U.S. Navy in Japan on suspicion of beating and sexually assaulting his Japanese girlfriend.</p>
