<p>Stocks surged Friday as technology issues rallied, the dollar rose against most major currencies and bonds edged higher.</p>
<p>The dollar hit its highest level in 2-1/2 years against the Swiss franc and hit a fresh 45-month high against the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 101.60 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 6,544.09. It was one of its biggest point gains ever.</p>
<p>Unlike Thursday, when a late rally was largely contained to blue-chip issues, Friday's advance showed much more broad support as advancing issues beat losers 1,850 to 717 on active volume of 451.9 million shares.</p>
<p>The rally wiped out a 101.10 point loss registered on the Dow on New Year's Eve and narrowed blue-chip losses to 16.82 points for the week.</p>
<p>Even with the rally, the Dow's rise was no match in percentage terms to that of the technology-rich Nasdaq Composite index. The index climbed 29.98 to 1,310.68, up 19.3 on the week, amid new optimism about the economy and an improving outlook for semiconductor companies. The gain was second only to a 33.18 point rise posted on July 17, 1996.</p>
<p>Analysts said the stock market's sharp turnaround, which reversed most of the Dow's losses for the week, showed equity investors had shaken off the jitters that a series of strong economic indicators had injected into the bond market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there's renewed confidence the economy is still going to grow moderately and you're seeing that clearest in the techs,&quot; said Peggy Farley, chief executive at Amas Securities.</p>
<p>Analysts also noted that a flood of cash from sources like annual retirement account contributions was now finding its way into the market and likely helped fuel the rally.</p>
<p>&quot;Fund managers have got to put that money to work,&quot; said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. &quot;Today, that decision was easy. Companies like Cisco and Intel and Microsoft got the money.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts saw signs of pent-up demand in the buying binge.</p>
<p>&quot;There had been a lot of buyers just waiting, especially on the big name techs,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. &quot;They just needed something to get them off the fence.&quot;</p>
<p>The bellwether 30-year Treasury edged up 2/32, a gain of 62.5 cents on a $1,000 bond, pushing its yield down to 6.73 percent from 6.74 percent at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>The dollar rose as high as 116.70 yen and stood at 116.39 late in New York, up from 115.58 yen late Thursday. It advanced to 1.3633 Swiss francs before settling at 1.3590, well above 1.3465 late Thursday.</p>
<p>The dollar hit its highest level against the yen since 117.25 in April 1993 and its highest against the Swiss franc since 1.4090 in June 1994.</p>
<p>The dollar rose to 1.5667 German marks from 1.5430 marks.</p>
<p>Heating oil prices fell after oil inventory data showed supplies grew significantly amid weak demand.</p>
<p>Heating oil for February delivery lost 0.82 cent to 71.29 cents a gallon at the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>February crude oil fell 10 cents to $25.59 a barrel and February gasoline fell 0.40 cent to 70.70 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index rose 32.1 points to 4,089.5, but was down 1.5 points for the week. The Tokyo stock market was closed for a holiday.</p>
