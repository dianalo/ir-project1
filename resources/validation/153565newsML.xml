<p>Safeway Inc. said Wednesday it offered to buy the rest of Vons Cos. Inc., another supermarket chain, in a stock deal that will create the second-biggest grocery store chain in the country.</p>
<p>Pleasanton, Calif.-based Safeway, which operates 1,050 stores in the United States and Canada, already owns 34.5 percent of Vons, which operates 325 stores, mostly in southern California, under the Vons and Pavilions names.</p>
<p>Vons responded that a committee of its outside directors would study the offer and respond &quot;in due course.&quot; Several Safeway executives currently sit on Vons' board.</p>
<p>Merger and acquisitions experts said that ultimately a friendly deal was likely because Safeway and Vons share a common history as well as common directors.</p>
<p>They also said that investment firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s 52 percent ownership of Safeway further supported their view that the companies will combine in a negotiated deal.</p>
<p>KKR is the linch pin in the shared board seats. Robert MacDonnell is a KKR general partner and director of both Safeway and Vons, and KKR executive James Greene is a director of both.</p>
<p>In addition, they said, Safeway Chairman Peter Magowan and President Steve Burd also sit on both boards.</p>
<p>&quot;My guess is it's friendly,&quot; one merger specialist said. &quot;There are a lot of overlapping board members and there's (Safeway's) ownership of (Vons) stock. From a fairness standpoint, Safeway had to make it look favourable for Vons.&quot;</p>
<p>In a letter to Vons, Safeway offered to exchange 1.34 Safeway shares for each Vons share not currently owned by Safeway.</p>
<p>Based on Safeway's price of $41.75 a share Tuesday, the deal would value Vons shares at about $56.</p>
<p>Vons gained $10.875 to $54 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;The combination of Safeway and Vons would result in the second-largest grocery store chain in North America, with 1,375 stores operating in 16 states, the District of Columbia and five Canadian provinces and sales in excess of $22.5 billion,&quot; Safeway said.</p>
<p>Safeway said it was committed to completing the transaction and will not buy more Vons common stock except on a basis offered to all of Vons shareholders.</p>
<p>The combined company would have the No. 1 or No.2 market share in each of its 10 operating regions, Safeway said.</p>
