<p>Anglo-Dutch consumer group Unilever Plc NV is set on expansion in the developing and emerging markets of the Far East and Latin America, said chairman Niall Fitzgerald in an interview with Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There will certainly be a larger proportion of the business in developing and emerging markets in five years time,&quot; said Fitzgerald, who set a target of 50 percent of trading profits from these markets in seven years time compared with its current 30 percent.</p>
<p>Since raising $8 billion from the sale of its four speciality businesses to ICI Plc in July, the market has been rife with speculation Unilever will mount a take-over. The takeover talk has driven shares in Reckitt and Coleman, Cadbury-Schweppes Plc, Groupe Danone and others.</p>
<p>Unilever's second quarter results showed sales down one percent in Europe but up a staggering eight percent in emerging markets.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald declined to specify what types of businesses were under consideration but said current policy was to look for areas where the company could find &quot;incremental growth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In other words we do not want to dilute our growth rate. We are looking for businesses which are clearly growing faster and in the portfolio we have and in regions where there is strong growth in our categories,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;So that will be where the focus is. And whether that is one buying or a series of medium sized buyings we will see in the coming year or so.&quot;</p>
<p>Although sales declined in Europe in the second quarter, the region showed the strongest margin growth with margins before exceptional items up by 2.52 percentage points at 11.97 percent.</p>
<p>But Fitzgerald warned against expecting this level of margin growth in the future. &quot;What we are seeing now is the results of what we have been doing over the last two to three years. A lot of restructuring, a lot of portfolio tidying up and that has been reflected by dropping low margin products and by reducing costs quite significantly,&quot; said Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of that cost reduction has to go back into the marketplace to keep us competitive but we are beginning to see it coming through now. And the margin improvement in the second quarter had a number of specific things in it as well; positive things. So I would not expect that level of continued improvement.</p>
<p>&quot;But we are focusing on driving our margins up, slowly, but surely and progressively,&quot; said Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>In five years time the company will be much more focused on branded consumer goods and services with larger interests in its priority categories across food, and home and personal care, said Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>&quot;And who knows, we might surprise the market by moving into categories that are adjacent to those. What those might be I would not care to speculate just now,&quot; he added.</p>
