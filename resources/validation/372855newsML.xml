<title>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: Irish bonds firm, buoyed by punt strength in ERM.</title>
<headline>Irish bonds firm, buoyed by punt strength in ERM.</headline>

<p>Irish bonds remained strong along the curve in thin afternoon trade on Wednesday, buoyed by ongoing punt strength in the ERM grid, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We started out well bid at the shorter-end on the back of sterling's strong performance. Sterling fell away around mid-day but we are still in good shape and have managed to hold on to yesterday's gains,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Volumes have not been particularly large while yields are lower. Irish bonds are four basis points lower in the 10-year area and between five and six basis points lower in the shorter-end. We have managed to outperform other markets again today,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>Traders attributed Ireland's outperformance to the punt's position at the top of the ERM grid where it was trading around 11.52 percent above the weakest currency.</p>
<p>&quot;That has led to downward pressure on interbank rates but we have also seen a lot of resistance from the Irish Central Bank,&quot; the dealer said, adding that the bank had been draining liquidity from the money market.</p>
<p>By 1655 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was up 15 pence from Tuesday's close at 103.65 to yield 5.58 percent while the key benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 was up 27 pence from the close at 111.32 to yield 6.36 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said Irish bonds were trading at 143 basis points over German bunds in the five-year area and 84 basis points over bunds in the 10-year area.</p>
<p>One-month money rate was at 5.69/5.81 compared to 5.56/5.69 at Tuesday's close while the one-year money rate was at 5.75/5.88 compared to 5.63/5.75 at the close.</p>
<p>Dealers said attention tomorrow would continue to focus on the currency but the market would also keep an eye on the U.S. where the Treasury plans to sell $12.0 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday followed by $10.0 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday.</p>
<p>It auctioned $17.75 billion of three-year notes on Tuesday.</p>
<p>New issuance of U.S. corporate bonds was expected to continue to slow on Wednesday as companies waited out the U.S. Treasury's quarterly refunding this week, dealers said.</p>
<p>Despite the current lull, several corporations are preparing to sell new bond issues once the auctions are over, syndicate sources said.</p>
