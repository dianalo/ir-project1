<headline>INTERVIEW - Chiroscience upbeat on cancer drug.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-03</dateline>

<p>Biotechnology firm Chiroscience Group Plc said pre-clinical testing of two anti-cancer compounds showed they did not cause the side effects seen in similar products such as British Biotech's potential blockbuster marimastat.</p>
<p>Chief executive John Padfield told Reuters in a telephone interview that several months of testing with monkeys showed no evidence of joint pain.</p>
<p>That was the side effect noted with other matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, a novel class of cancer drugs that do not kill a tumour but instead block its growth.</p>
<p>The joint pain is probably caused by Interleukin-1, but Padfield said this chemical is not released by the two Chiroscience compounds which will enter human trials in the fourth quarter of this year,</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that if you have drugs with the same efficacy as marimastat, but not the same side effects, than that is clearly an advantage to patients,&quot; said Padfield.</p>
<p>He cautioned however for too much optimism over the compounds' prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;It is early days yet,&quot; Padfield said. &quot;The most important stage is to get into clinical trials and check that it is well tolerated and particularly that it does not have the joint pain side effects.&quot;</p>
<p>In its drug development update released earlier today, Chiroscience also announced it was considering to start human trials with new anti-asthma drugs.</p>
<p>The compounds could be developed to become the first drugs to fight both the early and late phases of an asthma attack, Padfield said. &quot;We will maybe be able to provide a treatment against a wider variety of asthma,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Chiroscience is already in the more advanced stages of developing another PDE IV drug, D4418, which is entering clinical trials by the end of May.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall be showing data today which show that follow-up compounds wipe out both phases completely,&quot; Padfield said, adding a couple of more months were needed to make decision on any clinical trials.</p>
<p>Chiroscience has one product, the local anaesthetic Levobupivacaine, that is close to the market. Padfield said Chiroscience plans to file for registration in Europe by the end of 1997 and in the U.S. by April 1998.</p>
<p>He said the anaesthetic, a cleaned-up version of an existing product, was well received in the anaesthetic industry because it proved to be less toxic to the heart than others.</p>
<p>Padfield said the integration of Darwin Molecular Corporation, the U.S. gene-based technology firm acquired last year, is progressing well.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be talking more about that progress to the City in May,&quot; he said.</p>
