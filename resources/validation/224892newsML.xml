<title>SLOVENIA: Slovenian shares firm, further growth seen.</title>
<headline>Slovenian shares firm, further growth seen.</headline>
<dateline>LJUBLJANA 1996-11-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Slovenian shares rose 1.28 percent on Friday to end the week 0.7 percent higher, and traders predicted further growth in December.</p>
<p>Traders attributed the market's strength to a fall in prices due to the prevailing political uncertainty in Slovenia which awaits the formation of a new government.</p>
<p>Almost three weeks after a general election held on November 10, it remains unclear who will form the government as parties on the left and the right, who share an even number of votes, insist on their own candidates for prime minister.</p>
<p>Current prices were low compared to a month ago when the index stood at 1,200.7, traders noted, adding that shares were likely to continue to rise in December due to book balancing before the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe we can expect rises in December when companies balance their books. However, big growth cannot be expected due to the uncertain political situation,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>The 10-shares SBI index rose 14.61 points to 1,160.1. Overall 17 shares rose, one fell and seven were untraded.</p>
<p>Turnover climbed to 110.5 million tolars from 70.9 million.</p>
<p>Bank SKB had the highest turnover, closing 1.18 percent up at 41,990 tolars on volume of 674 shares for total turnover of 28.1 million tolars.</p>
<p>Financial consultancy Primofin was the top gainer, rising 13.53 to 29,700 on volume of 17 shares for total turnover of 0.5 million tolars.</p>
<p>Ordinary shares of bank Dolenjska banka were the only decliners, easing 0.17 percent to 11,600 on volume of 100 shares for total turnover of 1.2 million tolars. -- Marja Novak, Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-126-3644</p>
