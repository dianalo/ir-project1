<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ shares get support from Telecom for firm start.</title>
<headline>NZ shares get support from Telecom for firm start.</headline>

<p>New Zealand shares opened the week nine points higher on volume which brokers said was good for a Monday, which is normally quiet ahead of major world market openings.</p>
<p>With just over an hour's trade under its belt the NZSE40 capital index was up 8.71 points at 2312.40. The release of April merchandise trade made no impact on prices or the index.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very quiet. Even though there is reasonable volume done for a Monday it was basically volume done overnight,&quot; broker Peter Lynds at ANZ Securities said.  </p>
<p>Lynds saw good turnover in Fletcher Paper and Energy, and takeover target McCollam Printers saw a sale of 1.3 million shares reported which was probably crossed late on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;With New York and London closed tonight our market will probably not have a trend until Wednesday,&quot; Lynds said.</p>
<p>The merchandise trade figures are due to be followed by producer price index data from Statistics NZ on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;But I don't think the market is really going to hold its breath for either of those quite frankly. More importantly Telecom are firm on the buyback and have sold up to $6.90 and that is the reason why the market is up.&quot;</p>
