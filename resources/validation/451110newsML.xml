<p>Spain's banking giant Santander presented on Tuesday a plan to boost profitability in the medium term while increasing activity in Latin America.</p>
<p>The bank set three goals, an 18-20 percent return on equity over three years versus 1996's 15.6 percent, a minimun compound annual growth for earning per share of 15 percent versus 13.6 in 1996 and a reduction in the ratio of operating costs to operating margin to 55 percent from 63 percent last year.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to be the biggest, but the best. We want to be compared with the better banks around the world and to have the highest profitability&quot;, chairman Emilio Botin told reporters in a news conference.</p>
<p>Botin added that Santander had gained a prominent position in the Spanish banking system thanks to a policy adopted 10 years ago, while its profits rose 17 percent.</p>
<p>The bank hopes to increase commercial banking activities, with a return on equity at 38 percent in 1996, as well as business in Latin America.</p>
<p>A statement added the market value of Santander investments abroad now stands at US$ 8.451 billion which implies latent capital gains of more than 500 billion pesetas, or US$ 3.95 billion.</p>
<p>In addition the group currently estimates latent gains in its portfolio of government debt of more than US$ 1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Santander's medium-term business line goals include achieving an average contribution to net income by retail banking in Spain of 48 percent and 27 percent for retail banking abroad.</p>
<p>The total book value of banking and financial investments abroad comes to US$ 4.916 billion, representing 42.5 percent of the total group capital. Botin said the 1997 Latin America contribution to the attributable profit should be doubled from the 1996 US$ 200 million.</p>
<p>Botin said Santander has a three percent stake in Empresa de Electricitad National, Endesa and a two percent stake in the Spanish giant Telefonica, which could be increased.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not rule out the possibility to increase that stake because they are doing fine,&quot; said Botin adding that Santander won't participate in Retevison's auction while it has the intention to sell its remaining 5.5 percent in Airtel.</p>
<p>Santander has a high level of liquid assets, standing at 387 billion pesetas, but Botin said the bank is very cautious before getting involved in new investments.</p>
<p>The new acquisition has to offer a RoE of around 20 percent and its diluted effect does not to last more than two years.</p>
<p>About its once-plagued unit, Banesto, in which Santander has a 50 percent stake, Botin said it was a strategic investment for his group.</p>
<p>He added Santander could sell a five percent stake in Banesto, but no more than that.</p>
