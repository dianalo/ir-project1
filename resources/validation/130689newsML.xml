<title>USA: Former Kmart official, broker accused of insider trading.</title>
<headline>Former Kmart official, broker accused of insider trading.</headline>

<text>
<p>A former Kmart Corp. executive was accused Monday of providing inside information to a Texas real estate broker who allegedly earned $263,835 by investing in an office supply chain sold to Kmart in 1993.</p>
<p>The complaint brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission was the latest of several legal actions that have stemmed from investigations by federal officials and Kmart itself of fraud and wrongdoing at its real estate department.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit,  accuses former Kmart executive Michael Garzoni of tipping real estate broker Mark Aronds to talks between Kmart's OfficeMax subsidiary and BizMart, which Kmart OfficeMax bought in 1993.</p>
<p>Aronds invested $176,677 in stock and options of Intelligent Electronics Inc., BizMart's former parent, in 1992 and later sold them for a $263,835 profit, the SEC said.</p>
<p>Kmart fired Garzoni in 1992. It spun off OfficeMax in 1994.</p>
<p>U.S. regulators are seeking permanent injunctions against Aronds and Garzoni, who marketed distressed Kmart property in Texas, the return of profits and other penalties.</p>
<p>Troy, Mich.,-based Kmart filed a civil suit against Garzoni, Aronds and others in April, accusing them of concocting non-competitive real estate deals in which the retailer received unfavourable terms from purchasers or paid commissions that were not earned.</p>
<p>Kmart is seeking to recover $20 million in losses in its civil suit pending in U.S. district court in Houston.</p>
<p>&quot;We intend to vigorously pursue our legal action,&quot; said Kmart spokesman Robert Burton.</p>
<p>In addition, a federal grand jury in Detroit indicted the two men in September, charging Garzoni helped Aronds to wrongly charge the retailer for fees in a deal involving an Oak Ridge, Tenn. Kmart store.</p>
<p>Aronds denies he received any inside information about Kmart's BizMart deal, his attorney, Henry Asbill, said. He said his client has filed a civil suit in state court in Houston seeking $1 million in unpaid commissions from Kmart.</p>
<p>Aronds bought the Intelligent Electronics securities because he thought they were good investments, and some of his family members who also purchased stock wound up losing money.</p>
<p>Garzoni did not return phone calls seeking comment.</p>
<p>In January, Kmart hired Kroll Associates, a firm specialising in internal corporate investigations, after its former shopping-centre development director was accused of taking kickbacks in real estate deals.</p>
<p>Michael Dowdle pleaded guilty in May to federal charges in Milwaukee of conspiring to defraud Kmart of $750,000.</p>
<p>Kmart's investigation of its real estate department continues, company spokesman Burton said.</p>
