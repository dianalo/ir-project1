<p>Bangladesh's Eastern Bank Ltd (EBL) said on Monday its net profit could leap to 137 million taka ($3.2 million) in calendar 1995 against just 5.4 million taka in 1994, but it would continue to deny dividends to shareholders.</p>
<p>The EBL emerged after liquidation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (overseas) operation in Bangladesh, and began functioning in 1992 with a liability of 3.16 billion taka.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank is still recovering from losses since the takeover,&quot; said managing director A.I.M. Iftikar Rahman. The bank has never offered dividends since listing on the Dhaka Stock Exchange in 1993.</p>
<p>EBL has paid-up capital of 600 million taka. Its 100 taka share was last traded on October 21 at 97.5 taka.</p>
<p>EBL officials said the private-sector bank, which will hold its annual meeting on Thursday, had an estimated net profit of 137 million taka in 1995, from 5.4 million taka in 1994.</p>
<p>The officials said the bank would not be able to pay a dividend to its shareholders.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been felt by all concerned that it would not be prudent and fair to declare a dividend before the review of BCCI assets and liabilities in 1997,&quot; one official said. Bangladesh's central bank will handle the review.</p>
<p>The officials said the bank incurred an operating loss of 20 million taka in 1992 after it took over from BCCI.</p>
<p>&quot;The year 1995 was a year of success and achievements for Eastern Bank Limited (EBL) despite political agitation and upheavals paralysing trade, commerce and industry,&quot; Rahman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Bangladesh was hit by frequent opposition-led general strikes and transport shutdowns through 1995 and early 1996, which forced then prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia to resign in March.</p>
<p>Operating profit increased to 193 million taka in 1995 from 53 million taka the previous year.</p>
<p>Rahman forecast the bank's 1996 operating profit at more than 270 million taka. Operating profit in 1994 was 53 million taka.</p>
<p>&quot;The market share of the company is not very significant. We are only four years old. The upward trend of operating profit of the bank reflects our energetic endeavour,&quot; Rahman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Bank handled import and export trade worth $114 million and $62 million respectively in 1995. The country's total imports in the same period were $5,834 million and exports were recorded at $3,473 million. ($1 = 42.5 taka)</p>
