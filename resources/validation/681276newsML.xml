<p>Dutch call money rates were stable on Monday and dealers said this indicated that liquidity was probably evenly divided among participants only few days ahead of the cash reserve expiry.</p>
<p>On Thursday the first cash reserve arrangement under the new market policy runs out and some dealers said earlier this could mean that call money would be volatile if liquidity was not evenly divided.</p>
<p>&quot;This does not seem the case,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>He added call money would probably remain at the current level of some 2.75 percent bid until Thursday.</p>
<p>The dealer said some participants had been filling liquidity gaps with the current ample allocation under the latest special advances pact.</p>
<p>On Friday the Dutch central bank allocated 4.07 billion guilders to the money market and individual banks' applications were met for 28.8 percent. This is a higher level than usual.</p>
<p>&quot;It is quiet in the money market,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>The guilder was little changed at 112.49 per 100 marks compared to 112.53 on Friday.</p>
