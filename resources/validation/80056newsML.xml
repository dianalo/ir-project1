<p>Singapore's key share index closed slightly higher on Thursday on small buying programmes in blue chips, but the broad market was dull, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Malaysian second board has come off sharply. Some mini funds are selling Malaysian stocks to buy selectively into Singapore,&quot; said an institutional dealer with a foreign firm.</p>
<p>The key Straits Times Industrials Index rose 7.29 points to 2,172.48. Dealers said there was no market-moving news and the small overnight gain in the Wall Street was not showing much lead either. The Dow was up 3.33 points at 5,877.36.</p>
<p>Cautious buying had capped market volume at a thin 83.65 million shares. Losers were ahead of gainers by 166 to 124.</p>
<p>Singapore Press foreign led the gainers, rising Singapore $0.40 to S$25.40. Among blue chip gainers were OCBC foreign, City Development, Sembawang Corp, Keppel Corp and DBS foreign.</p>
<p>Malaysia's speculative stock Causeway Investment was the top active with 6.92 million shares traded. It was up S$0.19 to S$1.53. SPK Sentosa, another Malaysian stock, gained S$0.34 to S$3.72 on rumours related to the lucrative Bakun project.</p>
<p>IPC Corp jumped in volume at late afternoon with 3.03 million shares traded and rose S$0.035 to S$0.53.</p>
