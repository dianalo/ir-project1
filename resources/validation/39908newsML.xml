<title>FRANCE: Protest against Pope hits French church service.</title>
<headline>Protest against Pope hits French church service.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-09-08</dateline>

<p>Some 30 protestors hurling cream cakes and water-filled condoms disrupted a service in Nantes cathedral, western France, on Sunday and threatened other attacks if Pope John Paul goes ahead with a visit to the area later this month, police said.</p>
<p>No one was hurt but the priest conducting the service fell to the ground when hit by the missiles, police said.</p>
<p>Fistfights broke out in the church as the demonstrators were chased out by members of the congregation. Two people were arrested but later released.</p>
<p>The protestors were led by Belgian national Georges Le Gloupier, a self-styled anarchist whose trademark is throwing cream cakes at personalities in public places like the Cannes film festival, police said.</p>
<p>Le Gloupier said in a statement to a news agency in Paris that the incident was only the first of a series unless the Pope cancels his planned September 19-22 visit.</p>
<p>The visit is triggering unprecedented opposition in a country once proud of its Roman Catholic piety, mostly because of the Pope's unflinching opposition to birth control, abortion and homosexuality.</p>
<p>A crude bomb was defused early this month in a church where the Pontiff is due to pray on the first day of his visit and up to 600 people have written to their bishops to ask that their names be struck off baptism registers.</p>
<p>Local councils and the centre-right government have come under fire for using public funds on the visit, with critics accusing them of violating the separation of church and state.</p>
