<headline>RTRS-AWA says keen to expand gaming unit.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-09-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Electronic and gaming machine group AWA Ltd said it was keen to expand its gaming machine business either through internal growth or through acquisitions.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking at a number of options to grow the gaming machine business either organically or through other means,&quot; AWA's new managing director John Rouse told reporters after the company reported net loss of A$14.26 million in 1995/96.</p>
<p>AWA chief financial officer Colin Henson said the group could spend between A$100 million to A$150 million on an acquisition. AWA had cash in hand of over A$60 million after the sale of its rural communications, aerospace and traffic unit.  </p>
<p>Henson said AWA had &quot;no more businesses for sale&quot; after the group sold the businesses on Thursday to Plessey Corp Ltd of South Africa for A$25 million.</p>
<p>Asked if the company could return some of its cashpile to shareholders, Rouse repiled:</p>
<p>&quot;The focus for AWA is for growth and so the focus would be for growing the company either organically or by acquisitions in the short term and so we would be looking to do something else than return the cash to shareholders.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have a 'preferred option' but it would be unwise of me to say anymore than that at this stage,&quot; Rouse said.  </p>
<p>Henson said he expected AWA to have an annual turnover of around A$120 million for the year to June 30, 1997.</p>
<p>Rouse said he expected increased profit contribution from its Club Keno business, which is the main operations of AWA.</p>
<p>He said AWA, which has been the subject of many takeover rumours, had not had any formal discussions with its largest shareholder RG Capital, which acquired its 15 percent stake last month in an on-market buying spree.</p>
<p>Despite the 1995/96 loss, AWA shares closed five cents higher at 80 cents on turnover of 5.31 million, its highest level since December 1994. --Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800</p>
