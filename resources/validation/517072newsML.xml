<p>Deputy trade ministers from 34 countries in the Americas prepared to wrap up talks Thursday without striking a deal on a free trade zone stretching from Alaska to the plains of Patagonia, a Brazilian official said.</p>
<p>Sebastiao do Rego Barros, general secretary of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, said officials would continue negotiating late into the night but had already accepted that a consensus on key issues would evade them.</p>
<p>&quot;Although we realise that not all the issues have been resolved ... many items were defined,&quot; he told reporters, adding deputy trade ministers would meet again for one or two days before a May 15-16 ministerial summit in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte.</p>
<p>Leaders of all the countries in the region, excluding Cuba, decided at the 1994 Miami summit to set up the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by the year 2005.</p>
<p>The deputy trade ministers were due to conclude Thursday four days of preparatory talks in Rio ahead of the May ministerial meeting, which will be followed by another meeting of ministers in Costa Rica next February and a presidential summit in Santiago, Chile, in March.</p>
<p>Officials say the key issue standing in the way of an accord was the timetable and structure of formal trade talks.</p>
<p>Everyone was in agreement that formal negotiations should begin after the Santiago summit but the Mercosur trade bloc of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay wanted to determine the exact nature of those talks first.</p>
<p>The United States and Canada defend a proposal that talks on all aspects of trade liberalisation should begin at the same time, while Mercosur wants to talk &quot;business facilitations&quot; first, then subsidies and finally the sensitive subject of tariff cuts.</p>
<p>Barros said the Mercosur position enjoyed the support of &quot;the silent majority&quot; while Canadian officials have painted the South American trade bloc as the lone rebel.</p>
<p>Barros said that the pressure to strike a deal before heads of government turned up in Santiago next March was a healthy stimulus that would prod FTAA negotiators into action.</p>
<p>But other Brazilian officials earlier conceded that the official launch of negotiations after Santiago could be endangered.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,&quot; said Jose Artur Denot Medeiros, Brazil's envoy to the Latin American Aladi group.</p>
<p>Barros preferred to call the target date for official talks a &quot;conditional consensus&quot;.</p>
<p>The Rio meeting was expected to come up with a Ministerial Declaration for Belo Horizonte which officials said would highlight areas of agreement and leave areas of discord to be resolved by the ministers.</p>
<p>The fact that the most important items had not been resolved in Rio did not mean that Belo Horizonte would be a failure, Medeiros said.</p>
<p>&quot;This hasn't caused surprise, disappointment. None of that. This is just the normal process of international negotiations,&quot; he said.</p>
