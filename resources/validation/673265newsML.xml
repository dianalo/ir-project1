<title>USA: U.S. grade barrels lure refiners, prices edge up.</title>
<headline>U.S. grade barrels lure refiners, prices edge up.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-19</dateline>

<p>Refiners looking to fill their ratable barrel needs forced domestic grade differentials slightly higher Thursday morning, while outright crude prices were stagnant to only a shade firmer off NYMEX buying.</p>
<p>&quot;For the past four days we have seen refiners in there buying after getting way behind on their ratable barrels,&quot; said a cash trader.</p>
<p>Mid-morning prices saw cash July West Texas Intermediate/Cushing range around $18.85-95 a barrel, about five cents higher than late Wednesday. July Exchange for Physicals were talked a wide 6-10 cents over futures, with deals recorded from a nine cents premium late Wednesday.</p>
<p>Markets remain attentive to possible word on when Iraqi crude oil exports will resume under the second phase of the &quot;oil-for-food&quot; accord. Separate from the oil accord, are Thursday deliberations by the U.N. Security Council on how and if to punish Baghdad for the latest dispute over weapons inspections in the country by U.N. Special Commission personnel.</p>
<p>For the market, Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James sold at a five cents discount to the benchmark WTI/Cushing cash price, three cents firmer than Wednesday.</p>
<p>West Texas Sour/Midland was heard sold at a $1.28 discount to the same marker, in a few pennies from yesterday. WTI/Cushing Postings traded hands at $1.85, again a few cents stronger than previous deals.</p>
<p>Traders said a narrow WTI/Brent arbitrage and absorption of West African sweets in the Gulf has aided the LLS cause in recent sessions.</p>
