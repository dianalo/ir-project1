<p>The Swiss government on Monday dismissed a member of parliament's bid to abolish banking secrecy, insisting current legislation protected customer confidentiality without shielding criminals.</p>
<p>The cabinet urged the National Council, the lower house of parliament, to vote down a motion submitted by deputy Jean Ziegler, one of Swiss banks' most vocal domestic critics, though a lone voice, to get rid of banking secrecy as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In a statement, the government said provisions that punish bankers for disclosing sensitive information served to protect banking clients and were less strong than professional secrecy afforded to doctors, lawyers and ministers against prosecutors.</p>
<p>Restrictions on banking secrecy that have already been adopted go a long way to prevent criminal acts, it added, insisting bank secrecy could now do little to cloak people trying to hide criminal proceeds in Switzerland.</p>
<p>&quot;Assertions to the contrary rest primarily on ignorance of the legal situation. They should be countered through appropriate educational efforts,&quot; it said, noting Switzerland was not the only country to protect banks' clients.</p>
<p>Switzerland adopted its vaunted banking secrecy in 1934 primarily to shield French and German customers from the prying eyes of tax collectors, historians say, although it later also helped protect Jews trying to hide their wealth from the Nazis.</p>
<p>Secrecy is key to Switzerland's success as a financial centre managing wealth for rich individuals, but it has come under growing scrutiny amid allegations that banks stonewalled families of Holocaust victims seeking unclaimed treasures here.</p>
<p>The cabinet said banking secrecy in its current form weighed private and public considerations in a way that took into account not just the importance of Switzerland as a banking centre, but also the needs of investigators here and abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;The cabinet would not want to jeopardise this balance,&quot; it said.</p>
