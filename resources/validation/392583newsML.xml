<p>After a year stuck in the doldrums since its postwar reopening, the Beirut Stock Exchange is starting to show signs of increased activity as Lebanese interest rates drop and new bank shares liven up the market.</p>
<p>Beirut stockbrokers say local and Arab investors are beginnning to show interest in shares as yields plunge on government treasury bills, which have soaked up private investment for the past four years, and newly-listed Beirut bank stocks offer healthy returns.</p>
<p>Volume has just about doubled to nearly $2 million on a busy day on the Beirut bourse since the first two banks listed in December and January -- enough for traders to proclaim the first signs of a turnround on the market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the process of investor interest in the stock exchange has begun. It's inevitable,&quot; said Alain Balian, a deputy manager at Lebanon Invest finance house. &quot;Obviously falling interest rates cool interest in t-bills and among educated investors the banking sector is very attractive.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks have been making good money and everyone wants to get in on the game,&quot; Balian told Reuters.</p>
<p>Yields on Lebanese three-month to two-year t-bills have dropped since November to a range of 13.87-16.18 percent from 14.56-21.58 percent and are still falling. Banks are also reducing interest rates sharply.</p>
<p>Heavy demand for the two listed bank shares has encouraged Beirut stockbrokers. &quot;It's only a small beginning, but it's good because it is a beginning,&quot; said Nabil Aoun, head of Fidus brokerage house, and a member of the stock exchange committee.</p>
<p>Before the bank listings the only regular trade on the bourse was in Solidere, the real estate company rebuilding central Beirut, whose shares have performed disappointingly since a dramatic debut in 1994.</p>
<p>Shares of the first bank to list, Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce, have risen 12 percent since their December 30 debut although the bank is not among Lebanon's top 10.</p>
<p>BLC's performance has been outclassed by Banque Audi, a leading Beirut bank, whose shares have risen 15 percent in a month since their January 20 debut.</p>
<p>Aoun said Fidus was taking more than $1 million in daily orders for Audi from Lebanese and Arab investors.</p>
<p>Two more banks plan to list soon -- Bank of Beirut, which ranked 16th in 1996 in size of deposits among Lebanon's 82 banks, and Byblos Bank, one of the most dynamic in the country.</p>
<p>Byblos this week reported a 60 percent 1996 rise in profits and brokers say its shares are shooting up in pre-listing trade on the grey market, nearing $6 from $2.60 two years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Byblos will be a star on the stock exchange. It has a good record, clever management strategy and record profits for the past three or four years,&quot; said a banker.</p>
<p>Listings by hotel and insurance companies are expected soon to diversify the market further.</p>
<p>Alain Balian at Lebanon Invest said Societe des Grands Hotels du Liban, which is rebuilding Beirut's 572-room Phoenicia Intercontinental and has already reopened the 90-room Vendome Intercontinental, is making preparations to list its shares.</p>
<p>Market sources say two insurance companies are also preparing to list, one of them possibly this year.</p>
<p>So far, however, the Beirut stock market is extremely small. Capitalisation is $2.4 billion and investors have only seven shares to choose from -- two banks, four cement or industrial companies, and Solidere, which itself accounts for about $2.1 billion of the capitalisation.</p>
<p>The cement and industrial companies are rarely traded on the exchange. Brokers cite their lack of transparency but say there is a lot more trading in their stocks on the grey market.</p>
<p>Solidere's lacklustre performance, despite good 1996 results and progress in operations, puzzles some Beirut stockbrokers, particularly as Merrill Lynch reported in January the stocks were trading at a 43 percent discount to Net Asset Value.</p>
<p>&quot;The fundamentals are not driving the price....Fundamentally I think it's a good stock to buy, yet the price is not moving. It doesn't make sense,&quot; Balian said.</p>
