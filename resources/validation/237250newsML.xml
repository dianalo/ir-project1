<title>USA: CBOT soybeans close up on short covering, oil jump.</title>
<headline>CBOT soybeans close up on short covering, oil jump.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-12-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT soybean futures closed higher on a late short covering rally which was triggered by gains in soyoil, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It originated in oil and spilled into beans,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was nothing for sale, it was short and it just took off,&quot; said Ron Kucha of O'Connor and Co.</p>
<p>The soyoil market held firm throughout the session and late short covering, led by purchases from Rosenthal Collins, cut loose a flurry of short covering in other pits, especially in the soy pit, the traders said.</p>
<p>Soybeans traded lower most of the session as soymeal dropped amid a bearish weekly USDA export number for meal and on a mediocre export number for soybeans.</p>
<p>Soybeans also were pressed early by increased farmer selling and lower cash basis markets, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bean and oil (exports) were okay but everything else was lousy which was why we were on the defensive,&quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>Soybeans closed four to 6-1/2 cents per bushel higher, with January up five at $7.02. March was up six at $6.97-1/4.  </p>
<p>Prudential Securities was said a late buyer of soybeans and was the chief seller early in the day of nearly 10.0 million bushels of the January, traders said. Lee B. Stern and Co. sold six million bushels of January, they said and Term Commodities along with Cargill Inc bought three million January.</p>
<p>Soybean futures volume was estimated at 48,000 contracts, above the 45,521 traded Wednesday, according to the CBOT.</p>
<p>In soybean options, Smith Barney sold 500 March $7.25 calls at 7-1/2 cents, LIT America sold 500 January $6.50 puts and Tenco Inc bought 400 March $8.00 calls, traders said.</p>
<p>Soybean options volume was estimated at 15,000 contracts, above the 12,188 traded Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders said the soy complex was buffeted by USDA's export sales report which showed soymeal sales for the week ended November 28 at a minus 11,200 tonnes. The market was expecting net meal sales at 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Net export sales of soybeans were at the low end of expectations at 534,400 tonnes. The market was prepared for a soybean number of 500,000 to 600,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Cash and futures players agreed the January contract was feeling pressure from the U.S. domestic sector.</p>
<p>Grain dealers Wednesday and Thursday said the cash soybean basis bids weakened at many locations across the U.S. as farmers booked beans on the January due to its premium to the March.</p>
<p>The January/March closed at 4-3/4 cents, premium January a one cent squeeze from the spread Wednesday.</p>
<p>Technicians pointed to this week's break below $7.00 per bushel mark in the January as central to the market's performance early and were impressed with the quick bounce above that mark into the close.</p>
<p>The January contract surged on November 29 to a recent high of $7.18-1/2 per bushel a rally many fundamentalists and technicians labeled &quot;too much too soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Support in the January was at $6.95 per bushel early Thursday but that mark was quickly broken and Jan sagged to a session low of $6.89. Second support in the January was placed by chartists at $6.88.</p>
<p>The session high for January at $7.04 was set near the close. First resistance was at $7.00-1/2 and second resistance was at $7.06-1/2.</p>
<p>The short term nine day relative strength index (RSI) for January dipped to 39 points early, below the recent high of 67 points set at the close of trading on November 27. January's RSI closed at 52.5 points.</p>
<p>The market generally considers an RSI of 70 or more as indicative of an overbought market and 30 or less as oversold.</p>
