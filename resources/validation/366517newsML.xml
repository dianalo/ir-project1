<p>Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd said on Monday the restructuring of its vast gold interests was not an immediate priority but added that it was mulling the option.</p>
<p>Business Day newspaper said on Monday the mining giant was considering the restructuring of its gold interests in its gold and uranium division, AngloGold, which could see one or more mergers of existing gold mines.</p>
<p>AngloGold spokesman James Duncan told Reuters the company had tapped investors to find out what they were looking for in an investment.</p>
<p>&quot;We're getting a pretty shrewd idea out there what people want but right now our priority is the competitiveness of the South African operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Ultimately at some point down the line that will certainly influence what we do if we do anything.</p>
<p>&quot;But restructuring as this article speculates is not immediately on the radar screen,&quot; Duncan said.</p>
<p>Gold analysts said AngloGold, the biggest gold producer in the world, had been looking at restructuring its gold operations for some time.</p>
<p>&quot;They are looking at it and they are considering various ways of doing it (but) they are very tight-fisted on this one,&quot; said Societe Generale Frankel Pollack analyst Trevor Pearton.</p>
<p>Davis, Borkum Hare analyst Dave Giese said any future restructuring would hinge on whether mining house Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd decided to sell off its gold assets.</p>
<p>He said it also depended on whether AngloGold decided to rationalise its operations at Driefontein Consolidated Ltd, Kloof Gold Mining Co Ltd, Western Deep Levels Ltd and Elandsrand Gold Mining Company Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to make sense but I think it will take a massive reorganisation to make that more productive,&quot; Giese said.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually everybody is going the opposite way to become decentralised and smaller. Here you are looking at a situation where you are actually combining mega-mines -- the best mines in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;You will create the biggest gold mine in the world by combining those operations,&quot; Giese said.</p>
<p>Duncan said AngloGold's core objectives remained &quot;global competitiveness for our existing South African operations, identification of 'Blue Sky' opportunities which will require capital and looking at appropriate investment vehicles for the raising of the capital to bring 'Blue Sky' prospects to account&quot;.</p>
<p>The company's Blue Sky project seeks to open up more gold mining possibilities in South Africa where gold output has been declining steadily with rising working costs and dwindling grades chipping away at production in the country.</p>
<p>This include the development of two ultra-deep mines west of Johannesburg which could reach up to five km below the earth's surface. Anglo said last year it was still studying the ultra-deep mines.</p>
<p>Duncan said there was not timeframe attached to the company's intention of looking at appropriate investment vehicles.</p>
<p>&quot;We've said as much when we took people in October through our core objectives, those objectives are not cliches, they say absolutely what the intent of this management team is.</p>
<p>Analyst Pearton said Anglo recognised that its mines were not that attractive to investors.</p>
<p>&quot;They recognise the fact that their ratings aren't very high. They believe there is something they can do about it, the question is can they?</p>
<p>&quot;They have enormous mines by world standards so they've got special problems of trying to get those mines re-rated if in fact their re-rating is justified,&quot; he added.</p>
