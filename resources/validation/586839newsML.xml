<p>Fifty-two years after the defeat of Nazi Germany, deserters and conscientious objectors on Thursday finally won long-sought parliamentary recognition for rejecting Hitler's war and recompense for their persecution.</p>
<p>After years of wrangling, a large majority in the lower house of parliament voted for a resolution expressing sympathy for the suffering of deserters and conscientious objectors and recognised them as victims of Nazi injustice.</p>
<p>The parliament recalled the plight of many who were condemned to death, executed or sent to concentration camps and granted each of the around 300 objectors still alive a one-off 7,500 mark ($4,430) compensation payment.</p>
<p>&quot;With this motion we are clearly and unequivocally confessing the wrongs of the German war leadership of the Nazi empire,&quot; Justice Minister Edzard Schmidt-Jortzig said in a speech released ahead of the parliamentary debate.</p>
<p>&quot;German soldiers were torn between fulfilling their duty and resisting a criminal leadership,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But some deserters have criticised the resolution, calling it a &quot;partial rehabilitation&quot; that stops short of calling on German justice to lift their guilty verdicts.</p>
<p>Critics have said the resolution is marred by one line -- a concession to conservatives which says the declaration does not apply to those who deserted to escape punishment for crimes that would be punishable under law today.</p>
<p>This concession marked a compromise between the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition after years of wrangling.</p>
<p>Schmidt-Jortzig of the FDP said the resolution was an important step on the road to rehabilitating victims of Nazism, but said a law was still needed to repeal unjust sentences passed by Nazi courts that still stand.</p>
<p>The SPD's legal affairs spokeswoman, Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, agreed but said she thought parliament's resolution was acceptable despite showing signs of a compromise.</p>
<p>&quot;That (the resolution) is like that because... one does not want to wait until the last person condemned, who survived the horrors of war, has died,&quot; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>One lobby group representing many objectors estimates the Nazis persecuted between 70,000 and 80,000 men for desertion and as conscientious objectors. Some 30,000 of these were sentenced to death and 20,000 executed.</p>
<p>Campaigners have said they would accept parliament's decision because the survivors were old and sick and needed any material help they could get.</p>
