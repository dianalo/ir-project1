<p>A Briton and a South African captured by guerrillas while working in war-torn Tajikistan were freed on Saturday, the head of their mining company said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have been released. They are now in (the Tajik capital) Dushanbe and they are in good form,&quot; Robert Mendelsohn, head of London-based Gold and Mineral Excavation Ltd, told Reuters in the neighbouring republic of Uzbekistan.  </p>
<p>The Briton, Alex Lemon, and the South African, Barrent Knotze, were held by Tajik Islamist fighters for nearly three weeks after the mine where they were working, in Darvaz in the south of the former Soviet republic, came under their control.</p>
<p>Mendelsohn said the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and British diplomats were all involved in securing their release. The company kept the story out of the public eye for fear of jeopardising their employees' chances of release.</p>
<p>The company, which produced about one tonne of gold at the mine this year, is one of two mining gold in the remote mountainous republic bordering Afghanistan and China.</p>
<p>Tajikistan's secular government and the Islamist opposition signed an accord in Moscow last week aimed at ending a bitter four-year civil war that has killed tens of thousands and has displaced many more.</p>
