<p>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resolved most issues delaying a deal on Hebron in talks held in the wake of fresh violence in the West Bank town but did not set a date for a summit to seal an agreement, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Only one issue is left and after that a summit meeting will be set,&quot; chief Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas told Reuters, referring to a meeting between Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>An off-duty Israeli soldier opened fire in a Hebron market on Wednesday, wounding seven Palestinians, in what he called an an attempt to keep the town from coming under Palestinian rule.</p>
<p>Noam Friedman, 22, emptied the clip of his M-16 automatic rifle into the crowded open-air market before other soldiers overpowered him, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Friedman, wearing the skullcap and tassled undershirt of a religious Jew, smirked and shook his fist in police custody after an attack that was condemned by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Israeli leaders.</p>
<p>Abbas held more than eight hours of talks with Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai that ended early on Thursday to try to clinch a deal under which Israel would hand over 80 percent of Hebron to Palesinian self-rule.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost of the issues have been closed. At present there remains one or two issues that will be closed at a meeting between the chairman (Arafat) and Bibi (Netanyahu),&quot; Mordechai told reporters after the talks at the U.S. ambassador's home.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Palestinians will not ask to reopen clauses, it will be possible to finalise outstanding issues paving the way for a summit,&quot; Mordechai said.</p>
<p>Friedman told investigators he wanted to sabotage any transfer of power in Hebron, Israeli Major-General Uzi Dayan told army radio.</p>
<p>&quot;Hebron is ours now and forever,&quot; Friedman told Israel television with a defiance reminiscent of another religious ultranationalist, Yigal Amir, who murdered prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.</p>
<p>&quot;Abraham bought the Cave of the Patriarchs for 400 shekels of silver and nobody will give it back,&quot; he told reporters, referring to the biblical story by which Jews trace their claim to Hebron back 4,000 years.</p>
<p>The cave, where 29 Moslems were massacred by settler Baruch Goldstein three years ago, is holy to Jews and Moslems. It is slated to remain under Israeli control along with all Jewish holy places after Israel redeploys its troops in Hebron.</p>
<p>Friedman's attack, reflecting the feeling of betrayal of right-wing Jews opposed to returning captured land to Arabs, underscored the fragility of the U.S.-sponsored Middle East peace process and the volatility of Hebron.</p>
<p>&quot;Bibi (Netanyahu) remains alone, without Jews behind him,&quot; Friedman said, echoing Amir who killed Rabin 14 months ago to halt a land-for-peace deal with Arafat.</p>
<p>The United States, labouring to push Netanyahu and Arafat together to clinch a Hebron deal. President Bill Clinton said he urged the parties to reach an agreement as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Friedman, from Maale Adumim settlement near Jerusalem, fired for nearly 10 seconds into the vegetable market on Martyrs Street wounding men, women and a youth, witnesses and doctors said. Two of the injured were in critical condition.</p>
<p>He expressed no remorse for the attack.</p>
