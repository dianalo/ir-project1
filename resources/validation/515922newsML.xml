<p>The performance of long-term market rates is a key factor in determining how much credit tightening the Federal Reserve will do next, former Fed vice chairman Alan Blinder said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;One difficulty in predicting by how much the Federal Reserve will need to raise short-term interest rates is in predicting what the long bond will do,&quot; Blinder told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a much better relationship between the long bond rate and economic activity than with the overnight inter-bank lending rate,&quot; Blinder added.  </p>
<p>Blinder declined to predict the yield the long bond would need to reach to slow the buoyant pace of economic growth.</p>
<p>But he said the back-up of about 40 points in long-term rates from an average of 6.70 percent in 1996 to a recent average of 7.10 percent represents only a small monetary tightening.</p>
<p>&quot;The long bond can do quite different things in response to a 25-basis-point hike in the funds rate,&quot; said Blinder who now holds the chair of economics at Princeton University.</p>
<p>&quot;Translating federal funds rate moves to long-term interest rates is what really matters,&quot; Blinder stressed.  </p>
<p>The Princeton University professor also said it is difficult to estimate by what percentage the Gross Domestic Product would fall as a result of higher long-term rates.</p>
<p>&quot;My own rule is that a one-basis-point rise in the long bond yield results in a $600-million contraction in spending. But that rule, 40 basis points shaves about one-third of a percent from GDP,&quot; Blinder said. &quot;The Fed staff is trying to estimate things like that all the time.&quot;</p>
<p>Preventing the occurrence of two consecutive years of above-trend growth was the main consideration behind the Fed tightening in March, Blinder said.  </p>
<p>The U.S. GDP grew at a 3.1-percent year-over-year in 1996 and is showing no sign of slowing down as private economists forecast first-quarter GDP growth as high as 5.0 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe prospect of more than one year of above-trend growth starting from full employment is the main concern that drove the committee to raise interest rates,&quot; said Blinder who added the Fed is watchful &quot;for incipient signs of inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>As the U.S. economy experienced in the 1990s a succession of one year of above-trend growth followed by one year of below-trend growth, the underlying rate of inflation edged lower to stabilize around 2.5 percent.  </p>
<p>The pattern of strong economic expansion followed by weaker growth has allowed the Fed to avoid major interest rate changes for more than two years.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the battle between opportunistic and deliberate disinflators,&quot; said Blinder who pioneered the theory that inflation will edge lower by itself during periods of slow growth or contraction.</p>
<p>&quot;My hunch is that the opportunistic disinflation theory is the more important of the two camps at the Fed,&quot; Blinder added, in reference to the lack of drive at the Fed to force inflation below its current level.  </p>
<p>As a result, Blinder did not expect the Fed to have much tightening to do since the inflation-adjusted funds rate is much higher than it was at the onset of the prior tightening cycle. In 1994, the real funds rate was zero and bond yield were just above their all-time low of 5.75 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the same situation,&quot; said Blinder who noted that both the funds rate and long-term rates were &quot;extremely stimulative&quot; in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't speak for others and I certainly can't speak for the Fed chairman (Alan Greenspan). But this should not require a great deal of work,&quot; the former Fed vice chairman said.</p>
<p>Blinder said 1996 growth was surprisingly strong and employment high, coupled with equally surprisingly low inflation at this stage in the cycle.</p>
<p>&quot;It's somewhat gratifying for the Fed,&quot; he concluded.</p>
