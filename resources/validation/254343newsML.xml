<title>UK: Clean product tankers firmer for Mideast-Japan.</title>

<p>Rates for clean oil product tankers were firmer for Mideast/Asia routes as plentiful product continued to seek scant tonnage, shipbrokers said on Friday.</p>
<p>Two 55,000 tonne ships were fixed on Thursday for the Mideast/Japan voyage at a bullish W210 and brokers said this was setting the tone for a firmer market.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of activity and there aren't many ships,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Rates for smaller tankers plying similar routes also gained in strength over the last few days. Reliance fixed the 29,000 tonne Castor from the Mideast to India at W260, and this follows the fixtures of the 33,000 tonne Al Sabiyah from Kuwait to India at W250.</p>
<p>Clean rates in the U.S. Gulf rallied, too, amid good enquiry and a relative lack of suitable cargoes. Brokers said rates for 30,000 tonners sailing Caribs/USAC were above W270 - and this rise was illustrated by the chartering of the 28,500 tonne Urzhum at a healthy W285.</p>
<p>UK/Cont rates for 20,000 tonners was assessed at around W240. An open arbitrage window for gasoline to the U.S. kept product flowing, as evidenced by Statoil's fixture of the 40,000 tonne Presnya from Mongstad to the USAC. The rate was not reported.</p>
