<p>The Maghreb pipeline connecting the Hassi R'mel gas field in Algeria with markets in Spain and Portugal is being filled with gas before the start of operations next month, the project's manager in Morocco said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Manuel Fontanilla Torres, project manager in Morocco for the Gazoduc Maghreb Europe, told an International Energy Agency gas conference in Berlin that the pipeline was on course for the start up of commercial operations in October.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a good example of beneficial international collaboration in the field of gas transportation,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;It constitutes a model in the promotion of integration and economic development at transnational level between two different economic areas, west North Africa and the European Union, very different but very close geographically. It will increase and assure the natural gas market to the West European area.&quot;</p>
<p>The 48-inch pipeline runs from Hassi R'mel across Algeria, northern Morocco, under the Strait of Gibraltar, to Cordoba in Spain. Here it will tie into the Portuguese distribution network and may ultimtely be expanded to supply France and Germany, Fontanilla Torres said.</p>
<p>The pipeline will in October have a capacity of 9.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year, although this may be expanded in a second phase to 18.5 bcm a year. Total investment in the first phase was $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>The pipeline is owned by a new company, Europe Maghreb Pipeline Ltd (EMPL), which in turn is owned by Spain's Enagas (72.6 percent) and Portuguese Transgas (27.4 percent). These two firms have also set up another company, Metragaz, to manage the line in Morocco.</p>
<p>The main technical challenge was the sea crossing of the Strait of Gibraltar, said Fontanilla Torres.</p>
<p>&quot;The submarine lines beat the record in several achievements,&quot; he said. &quot;The deepest submarine concrete coated pipelines in the world; the most precise bathymetry ever performed at such depths, and the first time for rock dumping at 400 metres depth in such strong currents.&quot;</p>
<p>The pipeline divides for the crossing, with two parallel 22-inch lines instead of the 48-inch line onshore.</p>
<p>The total length of the pipeline is 1,375 km, of which 45 km are offshore.</p>
<p>&quot;Line construction is finished,&quot; said Fontanilla Torres. &quot;Now we have tested it, we are putting gas into the line and expect to finish this by the end of the month.</p>
<p>&quot;We will then bring it up to pressure of 50 bars and we will commence operation in October.&quot;</p>
