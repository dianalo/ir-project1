<p>Former Guatemalan President Col. Alfredo Enrique Peralta Azurdia died early Wednesday morning in a military hospital, officials said. He was 88.</p>
<p>Peralta died of natural causes, army spokesman Col. Edgar Noe Palacios told Reuters. Palacios said he had no information on surviving family members.</p>
<p>The army installed Peralta, then defence minister, as president in 1963, a year after the first Guatemalan guerrilla groups formed and nine years after civilian rule was overturned by a CIA-backed coup.</p>
<p>The leftist rebels started an armed struggle that lasted more than three decades before a historic peace agreement last December.</p>
<p>During Peralta's three years in office, long-running border disputes between Guatemala and Belize boiled over and Guatemala threatened war against its tiny neighbour, then a British colony known as British Honduras.</p>
<p>Because of the dispute with Belize, Guatemala's diplomatic relations with Britain were suspended. They have yet to be normalised.</p>
<p>In 1966, elected president Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro replaced Peralta.</p>
