<p>The reclusive chief of Afghanistan's purist Islamic Taleban militia is visiting Kabul for the first time since his blackbearded fighters seized the city in September, Taleban sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The sources, at Taleban headquarters in the southern city of Kandahar, told the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) that Omar had gone to the Afghan capital on Saturday for talks with the ruling interim shura (council) there.</p>
<p>Omar was discussing &quot;recent changes in Afghanistan&quot;, the sources said, apparently referring to the Taleban's disastrous defeat last month in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif. They said Omar, 38, would return to his home base in Kandahar after his meetings, but gave no date.</p>
<p>The black-turbanned leader, whose word is law to his mainly ethnic Pashtun followers, founded the Taleban in mid-1994 to oppose what he saw as the corrupt and oppressive rule of Islamic mujahideen guerrilla factions who fought amongst themselves after the communist government collapsed in April 1992.</p>
<p>Omar, who lost his right eye while fighting the former Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, made his base in Kandahar after his young Afghan recruits from Koranic schools in Pakistan seized the city in October 1994 and has rarely left it since.</p>
<p>His decision to visit Kabul appeared to indicate deep concern at the see-saw fortunes of the Taleban, who are seeking to impose strict Islamic rule throughout Afghanistan.</p>
<p>On May 19, the Taleban forged a pact with northern General Abdul Malik, who led a mutiny against opposition leader Abdul Rashid Dostum and let Taleban fighters into Mazar-i-Sharif.</p>
<p>The pact, which for a few days gave the Taleban control of most of the north, collapsed amid friction between them and Mazar-i-Sharif's ethnic Uzbek and Shi'ite Moslem Hazara people.</p>
<p>Malik's Uzbek troops combined with the Shi'ite Hezb-i-Wahdat militia to expel the Taleban, who fled the city on May 28, leaving at least 300 dead and 700 prisoners.</p>
<p>While the Taleban were losing almost all their newly-gained territory in the north, opposition commander Ahmad Shah Masood broke out of his native Panjsher Valley to capture the strategic town of Jabal-os-Siraj at the foot of the Salang Pass.</p>
<p>Fighting has rumbled around the town for the past two weeks, but the Taleban have failed to reopen the Salang highway that links Kabul to the north, where a Taleban force of up to 3,000 is stranded in Pul-i-Khumri, besieged by Malik's Uzbeks and an Ismaili militia that formerly held the town.</p>
<p>Taleban sources quoted by AIP said opposition forces had launched attacks on the Taleban on all three frontlines around Pul-i-Khumri on Tuesday morning, but failed to break through.</p>
<p>The Taleban said they had killed at least 10 opposition fighters and captured many heavy weapons. Four Taleban militiamen were killed in combat, they added.</p>
<p>The sources said opposition forces had been thrown back on two of the three frontlines, but fighting was continuing on a third. They did not specify where battles were going on.</p>
<p>There was no independent account of the clashes and opposition spokesmen could not immediately be contacted.</p>
