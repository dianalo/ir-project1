<p>Prime Minister Tony Blair pledged on Wednesday not to give up the search for peace in Northern Ireland, still reeling from nights of riots, and came out in support of his beleaguered Northern Ireland Secretary.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not going to give up on Northern Ireland. I am going to carry on searching for a solution and I believe if there were true good will on all sides and a little bit of give and take and understanding a solution could be found,&quot; Blair said.</p>
<p>Blair, fresh from the NATO summit in Madrid, told parliament the recent violence in Northern Ireland had been appalling.</p>
<p>But he appealed to both sides of the sectarian divide in the British-ruled province to do everything they could to keep the drive for peace on course.</p>
<p>Blair backed Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam for her attempts to avert conflict, saying she had negotiated in good faith and praising her for her &quot;courage and determination&quot;.</p>
<p>Mowlam has been bitterly criticised by the nationalist community for allowing a Protestant Orange Order parade go ahead on Sunday through a predominantly Roman Catholic area of Portadown.</p>
<p>The march, which went ahead under heavy police protection, dramatically raised the political temperature ahead of this weekend's climax of the Protestant &quot;marching season&quot;.</p>
<p>The province is now braced for more violence.</p>
<p>A radical splinter group of the Irish Republican Army, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), has threatened to attack members of the Orange Order if they insist on marching down the Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>And a Catholic residents' group in Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second city, has called for a huge rally to protest against the holding of a march by the Apprentice Boys, another Protestant organisation, on the same day.</p>
<p>The 12th of July marks the anniversary of a 1690 Protestant battle victory over an invading Catholic King and is seen by Catholics as an anachronistic display of triumphalism.</p>
<p>Criticism of Mowlam has been intensified by the publication of a leaked document which appeared to show the decision to allow the Portadown march through had been taken well before negotiations between the two sides.</p>
<p>The government has dismissed the reports, saying the document was merely an initial review of options.</p>
<p>Mowlam, a feisty politician who began her job on a wave of sympathy after revealing she was recovering from an operation for a benign brain tumour, has ordered an investigation into the leak.</p>
<p>But this has failed to stem the criticism of Mowlam, who on Wednesday condemned the riots and told parliament that progress towards peace could only be made through &quot;accommodation and negotiation&quot;.</p>
<p>Blair, saying Mowlam was trying to do her best for all the people of Northern Ireland, added: &quot;The difficulty with this situation is that there are legitimate rights on all sides.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is how those were balanced out in extremely difficult circumstances.&quot;</p>
