<p>Bahrain's State Security Court jailed three Bahrainis for periods ranging from three months to a year for belonging to an illegal group and distributing leaflets, Bahraini newspapers said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Two people were accused of being members of an organisation aimed at changing Bahrain's political and social systems by the use of force, threats and violence, they said.</p>
<p>A third was charged with possessing leaflets containing false information and propaganda aimed at disturbing security and stability.</p>
<p>The government, seeking to speed up judgments, ordered the court in March to try hundreds of detainees held for street protests, sabotage and arson attacks. It has sentenced about 160 people.</p>
<p>At least 27 people, including three policemen and seven Bangladeshi workers, have been killed in two years of sporadic anti-government unrest by members of the island's Shi'ite Moslem majority seeking political and economic reforms.</p>
<p>An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) spokesman said on Friday the ICRC had begun visiting detainees held for security reasons in Bahrain.</p>
