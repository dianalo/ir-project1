<title>UK: London platinum, palladium prices soar.</title>

<p>Prices of the rare precious metals platinum and palladium leapt higher on Thursday on fears that there would be strike next month at the huge Norilsk production facility in Arctic Siberia.</p>
<p>&quot;The pressure has been building for some time but the strike news was the last straw,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Platinum was fixed at $393.50 per ounce, up $10.00 from Wednesday and recording its highest fix since September 9, 1996.</p>
<p>Its sister metal palladium jumped $7.00 to fix at $157.00, last seen on July 11, 1995.</p>
<p>A union official at Russia's cash-strapped Norilsk facility where workers have not been paid since October said this week a strike could begin on March 15. However an spokesman of the plant said the comment was &quot;premature&quot;.</p>
<p>Even so, the market took note of the threat. &quot;A strike at Norilsk would cause major problems for consumers,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Another dealer said, &quot;The speculators jumped in when they read that. They saw a fundamentally tight market with a rising price and said 'let's go'.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia is the leading exporter of platinum (correct) after South Africa, and the largest exporter of palladium. Japan is by far the largest consumer of both metals.</p>
<p>Platinum is used in jewellery, electronics, many chemical applications and as part of the mix of metals in autocatalysts which remove toxic gases from car exhaust fumes.</p>
<p>Palladium is also used in autocatalysts and in electronics and dental alloys.</p>
<p>Market interest in the metals gathered pace earlier this year when it became clear that the delayed start to negotiations on 1997 exports between Russian and the Japanese trade houses could disrupt supplies.</p>
<p>Talks have not begun yet and market insiders are estimating shipments might not begin until May.</p>
<p>Rhona O'Connell, metals analyst at stockbroker T. Hoare and Co, estimated that the Japanese trade houses might have begun the year with about eight weeks worth of stocks.</p>
<p>Market analyst Jeremy Coombs at Johnson Matthey, the world's leading refiner of the metals, said Japan's consumption of platinum and palladium was huge in 1995 and importers were contractually obliged to take the same quantities from Russia last year despite an economic downturn drying up demand for platinum and palladium bearing goods.</p>
<p>But now stocks are being used up which is being reflected in borrowing rates for palladium in Europe doubling in the past few weeks, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is also a premium of $5-$6 on sponge grade material which proves that Russia has not been shipping metal,&quot; Coombs added.</p>
<p>Sponge grade is the preferred type of palladium for most industrial uses and normally carries a premium to the ingot grade of around one dollar.</p>
<p>Dealers said the rising price may not have peaked yet. &quot;If the Russians get their export licences they could make spot sales and the price could suddenly correct,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;But equally if they cannot make up for lost exports, you could expect further rises,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Gold prices were swept along too and fixed at $356.60 per ounce up $1.85 from Wednesday and the highest fixing since January 14. Silver however was only couple of cents firmer at $5.25/$5.27.</p>
