<headline>British shares slip but have record levels in sight.</headline>

<p>British shares finished a choppy session lower on Wednesday after the influential head of the U.S. central bank warned for the second time in less than three months that interest rates may have to rise in order to fight inflation.</p>
<p>U.S. Federal Reserve Bank chairman Alan Greenspan also tried to pour cold water on sizzling share markets by warning that current share prices may be too high.</p>
<p>Despite Greenspan's cautionary views, the Financial Times Index of 100 leading British shares closed only 15.4 points lower at 4,329.3, well above an earlier low of 4,316.8</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan tried to stop the raging bull market before and failed. It looks like history could repeat itself,&quot; the head of share trading at a large British stockbrokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Many British institutions missed out in the market's rise last year and are desperate to buy. They see dips like the one Greenspan inspired today as a good buying opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>Greenspan is seen by financial markets around the globe as the most powerful U.S. official because of his control over U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>Last December he warned of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in the U.S. share market, which had soared the previous two years.</p>
<p>His comments last year initially caused turmoil in world markets but within 12 weeksthe Dow Industrials Average of 30 leading U.S. shares had jumped 500 points or 10 percent.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Dow plunged 100 points soon after Greenspan began his semi-annual testimony to the U.S. Congress, but had managed to halve the initial losses by the close of London trade.</p>
<p>Share strategists said investors' appetite for British and U.S. shares would continue due to the current low interest rate and inflation environment.</p>
<p>With interest rates and inflation at 30-year lows, professional investors tend to put cash in shares, which historically offer a much higher rate of return than other financial instruments such as government bonds.</p>
<p>Low savings rates offered by banks and building societies also encourage private investors to pump hard-earned cash into shares.</p>
<p>&quot;This is something that a lot of people have missed and has sustained this bull market,&quot; a London trader said. &quot;Until some other avenue comes along that offers attractive yields, this market will go higher.&quot;</p>
<p>With the FTSE 100 only 33 points below its all-time high of 4,362.4, reached on February 20, the only thing that can now prevent a new record is Wall Street.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan has given the markets something to think about and the big issue for us may well be how the U.S. markets perform overnight,&quot; a share dealer at a Japanese brokerage said.</p>
<p>Fear that a &quot;burger war&quot; could be waged in fast-food outlets around the world pushed shares in Grand Metropolitan plc 18-1/2 pence lower to 458-1/2 pence.</p>
<p>Investors fear U.S. giant McDonalds might drastically cut the cost of its &quot;Big Mac&quot; in order to attract customers away from rivals like Grand Met's Burger King chain.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, shares in British satellite-TV equipment maker Pace Micro Technology plc slumped 69-1/2p or 44 percent to 87-1/2 pence after the company issued a profits warning and said its joint chief executive had left the firm.</p>
