<p>Many Finnish equities analysts remain upbeat for Helsinki stocks next year, though gains look set to be much more moderate than the year to date.</p>
<p>Helsinki analysts polled by Reuters saw low interest rates and a revival in economic growth in Europe creating good opportunities for share gains next year, but said the overall rise would fall clearly short of this year's 40 percent.</p>
<p>The average of 14 analysts' forecasts put the HEX index at about 2,660 points by end-1997, up from about 2,400 as this year ends.</p>
<p>The range was 2,200 points (down 8 percent) to 2,880 (plus 20 percent), with most forecasts clustered between 2,600 and 2,750 points.</p>
<p>A rise of 10 to 15 percent in the HEX next year, after this year's exceptional 40 percent, would mean a return to the long-term trend showing average yearly growth of 12.6 percent since the 1950s, said Jukka Huuskonen of Arctos Securities.</p>
<p>Several analysts pointed to a cyclical upturn in Europe underpinning renewed strength in Finnish cyclical shares, including paper and metal issues, which account for a large portion of Helsinki's 270 billion markka market capitalisation.</p>
<p>Many analysts expect improved results from Finnish forestry companies next year, but some said a Europe-wide upturn might not help forestry stocks until later in the year -- first boosting basic metals, machinery and other cyclicals.</p>
<p>HELSINKI P/E DISCOUNT SEEN RETURNING</p>
<p>If confidence in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) holds, analysts see longer term scope for Helsinki to trim its historic discount to other European bourses based on price/earnings (p/e) valuations.</p>
<p>But the p/e gap has shrunk appreciably this year as prices have risen but earnings have fallen. In the short term analysts expect faster earnings growth combined with slower price gains to restore Helsinki's regional discount.</p>
<p>&quot;Next year I believe we will come close to the net earnings level we saw in 1995,&quot; said Arctos's Huuskonen, who estimated listed companies' profits had fallen 20 to 30 percent this year.</p>
<p>According to Roar Nilsen of Carnegie Securities, Helsinki's aggregate p/e for this year at around 16 is just above the average around 15 of the Stockholm, Oslo and Copenhagen bourses.</p>
<p>He sees Helsinki's p/e falling towards 11 next year, largely because of increased earnings, but expects a slower p/e decline in other Nordic markets: with, for instance, Stockholm around 15, Helsinki would trade at a discount around 25 percent.</p>
<p>Fund flows into stocks -- especially from domestic sources -- were seen healthy next year, as low interest rates keep equities attractive and with Finnish pension funds and individuals expected to step up their investment in stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;Investment by households and institutions will increase, with part of that money going into stocks and mutual funds. More and more pension money will also be going into stocks,&quot; said Vesa Sahivirta, senior analyst at Postipankki.</p>
<p>A government working group this year opened the door for more pension fund investment in stocks -- tightly restricted until now.</p>
<p>But analysts are more cautious on foreign fund flows into Helsinki stocks, saying foreign investors already have quite a strong presence.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investment will remain at the current level,&quot; Sahivirta said.</p>
<p>By end-November, total foreign ownership of listed Finnish firms stood at 27.2 percent of shares in issue, up from 24.2 percent at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>BEARS IN HIDING</p>
<p>And Helsinki is not without bears.</p>
<p>&quot;There are good prospects for all sectors, but they've already begun to be included in share prices,&quot; said one analyst, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>&quot;By the end of next year, there will be a need for tighter monetary policy. The momentum will start to be lost,&quot; she said, forecasting a decline in the HEX.</p>
<p>Participants in the poll, conducted over the past two weeks, were: ABB Aros, Aktia Bank, Arctos Securities, Carnegie Securities, Enskilda, Erik Selin, Evli Securities, FIM Securities, FSB Securities, Interbank, Opstock, Postipankki. Two investment houses contributed anonymously.</p>
