<headline>OPTIONS -Volatility deal struck in HSBC.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-29</dateline>

<p>The main business in UK stock options on Tuesday were volatility deals and book squaring -- or hedging -- against existing stock positions, dealers said.</p>
<p>Expectations of increased volatility was behind the main deal in banking group HSBC in which 220 July 1500 puts were bought at 33p as well as 220 July 1700 calls at 37p in a long strangle strategy.</p>
<p>Expiry of the options will be well after Hong Kong is handed over to the Chinese authorities -- at midnight on June 30 -- and greater volatility in HSBC shares will mean option premiums will go up to make the strategy profitable.</p>
<p>Dealers noted that volatility in HSBC shares traded in Hong Kong have risen more than of those shares traded in London so the options deal was also a means of arbitraging volatility.</p>
<p>By 1553 GMT, HSBC shares were up 36p at 1613p.</p>
<p>Remaining with the banks sector, options in Lloyds TSB Group were also wanted for a long strangle strategy and this involved buying 200 June 550 puts at 9p as well as 200 June 600 calls at about 14p.</p>
<p>If held to expiry the deal will be profitable if the underlying shares either go below 527p or above 623p.</p>
<p>Lloyds TSB shares fell 3p to 573p.</p>
<p>Over in insurer Prudential Corporation some 500 May 600 calls were bought by one trader which dealers believed was a means to cover a short position in the stock so that if the share price rallies, losses from the short position will be offset by gains from the options.</p>
<p>Prudential shares went up 13p to 604p.</p>
