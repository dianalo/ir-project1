<p>Shares of South Korean semiconductor manufacturers rose on Thursday as higher prices for memory chips and production cuts raised hopes for recovery for the battered sector, financial analysts said.</p>
<p>Samsung Electronics, the world's leading memory chip maker, rose 2,700 won (US$3.11) to 59,000. It briefly hit its daily upper-limit of 60,800.</p>
<p>LG Semicon climbed 1,500 won to its daily upper-limit of 21,100, and Hyundai Electronics also went limit-up, gaining 2,000 won to 28,000.</p>
<p>Industry analysts said spot prices for the 16-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips have risen to around $10 per unit from $6-$8 a month ago.</p>
<p>Production cuts announced by Samsung Electronics and LG Semicon were a factor behind the rising prices, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The plan by South Korean chip makers to cut production seems to be working. Further price rises are likely in the short run,&quot; said Koo Hee-jin, an analyst at the Daishin Economic Reserch Institute.</p>
<p>Sentiment was also backed by a report on Wednesday by U.S. research firm Dataquest that the worldwide DRAM market was showing signs of rebounding from last year's oversupply.</p>
<p>Dataquest said the DRAM oversupply rate will likely run at seven percent per quarter for most of 1997, down from the more than 10 percent oversupply in the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>Samsung earlier said it planned to cut memory chip production by 20 to 30 percent this year, adding a further reduction might be possible if the price stayed below $10-$12.</p>
<p>The company began reducing production of the memory chips in the fourth quarter of 1996 because of deteriorating profits.</p>
<p>Late in January LG Semicon said some production resources for the 16-megabit DRAMs would be re-allocated to other products because of oversupply.</p>
<p>Brokers said while prices for memory chips would fluctuate for sometime, the stocks remained undervalued after last year's consolidation.</p>
<p>&quot;Semiconductor shares fell sharply in 1996 when prices plunged about 80 percent. They have yet to see a major rally, though prices have begun to recover from the beginning of this year,&quot; said Choo Hee-yup, a broker at Donwon Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;In the long-term perspective, chip shares are viewed as good buys,&quot; said Koo of Daishin.</p>
<p>Brokers said more agressive portfolios by institutions also contributed to the surge in chip shares.</p>
<p>Seoul stocks have risen more than five percent since January 24 when Hanbo Steel Co defaulted on loan payments after piling up about five trillion won in debt.</p>
<p>More than six trillion won was supplied to prevent the Hanbo crisis from causing a chain reaction of corporate failures and to meet rising money demand before the Lunar New Year holidays on February 7-9.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall sentiment improved over a period of time due to ample liquidity. Institutions seem to begin including large-cap stocks like Samsung Electronics in their portfolio,&quot; said Kim Heung-shik, a broker at Hyundai Securities.</p>
<p>Brokers said shares of Samsung Electronics now traded at about 25 percent premium on the over-the-counter market.</p>
<p>Samsung dropped to a low of 38,600 in January from all-time high of 173,000 won in October, 1995, before rising again. ($ = 869)</p>
