<p>Prices of silver across India rose sharply on Tuesday, spurred by a firm world trend, and dealers said they expected the metal to stay firm in the next few days.</p>
<p>&quot;The silver market is very tight due to firm world prices,&quot; said Bombay Bullion Association president Makhanlal Damani. &quot;It will remain strong in the next few days.&quot;</p>
<p>Silver was fixed at 503.00 cents an ounce in London on Tuesday, its first fixing above the psychological 500 cents level since October 14, 1996.</p>
<p>The metal, which has soared some 30 cents over the past four days, had been fixed at 494.10 cents on Monday.</p>
<p>On the Bombay bullion market, silver opened 45 rupees higher at 7,040 rupees per kg and quickly climbed to close at 7,110 rupees, gaining 115 rupees during the session, dealers said.</p>
<p>Silver markets in the Indian capital Delhi and the western city of Ahmedabad showed an even firmer trend compared to Bombay by opening at 7,200 rupees and 7,150 rupees per kg respectively.</p>
<p>The closing prices of Delhi and Ahmedabad were not immediately available.</p>
<p>&quot;Imports are still coming as Delhi and Ahmedabad markets are offering a margin of 0.5-1.0 percent,&quot; Damani said.</p>
<p>He said a 2.0 percent sales tax and an entry tax of 0.5 percent in Bombay made trading in silver unprofitable in India's main commercial city at present.</p>
<p>&quot;Imports are directly going to Delhi and Ahmedabad as there is only a sales tax of 0.5 percent in those cities,&quot; said Damani. &quot;Most industrial users are depending on supplies from there.&quot;</p>
<p>India's second wedding season, which started in December, is expected to last up to May, fuelling demand for both gold and silver.</p>
<p>&quot;There will also be demand from farmers flush with money from an early summer harvest of crops,&quot; Damani said. &quot;In the next few days, silver prices could touch 7,250 rupees per kg.&quot;</p>
<p>At present, the cost of imported silver is about 7,150 rupees per kg against 7,050-7,200 rupees per kg in bullion centres.</p>
<p>Dealers estimate India's annual requirement of silver at 2,500-3,000 tonnes, all of which is imported.</p>
<p>They said industrial demand had risen in the wake of the country's economic reforms. The government in March 1993 allowed</p>
