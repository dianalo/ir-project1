<title>USA: Coast Guard not expanding Mississippi safety zone.</title>

<p>The U.S. Coast Guard said it does not plan to expand the approximate 240-mile safety zone it has imposed on the upper Mississippi this week but was closely watching the high water levels in that area.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not expanded the zone,&quot; said Lt Drew Cheney, assistant Chief of Port Operations, Coast Guard Marine Safety Office, St Louis.</p>
<p>High waters and potential flooding prompted the Coast Guard to close navigation from River Mile 615.1 at Guttenberg, Iowa to River Mile 857.6 at Minneapolis, Minn, late Wednesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are allowing some barge movement on a case-by-case basis.&quot; But for the most part, barge traffic was restricted. &quot;Navigation was closed primarily for safety reasons,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Cheney noted a possibility of other pockets that need navigation restrictions because of the structure of the levees and low-lying areas which are vulnerable to flooding.</p>
<p>Cheney said the Mississippi River at Minneapolis was expected to crest on Saturday at 19 feet, three feet above the 16-feet flood stage and at 21 to 22 feet at St Paul, Minn., eight feet above the 14-feet flood stage.  </p>
<p>Rising water levels may close another lock on Friday on the upper Mississippi, river officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;Lock and Dam 6 near Trempealeau, Wis., may close on April 11 due to high water,&quot; said Teri Alberico, administrative assistant with the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, St Paul, Minn. &quot;That is the estimated closing date. But we have not made that decision yet,&quot;</p>
<p>The Corps said it expected to close Lock and Dam 8 (Genoa, Wis) on April 14, Lock and Dam No. 9 (at Eastman, Wis.) on April 15 and Lock and Dam No. 10 (Guttenberg, Iowa) on April 16.</p>
<p>So far, eight locks have been closed from upper and lower St Anthony Falls, Minn, and south to Lock and Dam 5A at Fountain City, Wis., the Corps said.</p>
