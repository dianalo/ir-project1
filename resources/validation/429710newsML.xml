<p>While the Williams team lamented their failure in Sunday's Australian Grand Prix, the new Prost and Stewart teams celebrated excellent debuts on behalf of their celebrated owners.</p>
<p>Both Alain Prost and Jackie Stewart know the joy of winning titles as drivers and have seven world drivers' titles between them -- Prost four and Stewart three.</p>
<p>But they found watching the race from the pit wall far more emotional than taking part.</p>
<p>Prost saw his drivers Olivier Panis of France and Shinji Nakano finish fifth and seventh respectively -- the best results for a team with Bridgestone tyres.</p>
<p>The Stewarts driven by Brazilian Rubens Barrichello and Dane Jan Magnussen failed to finish but both men drove strongly and competitively for more than half the race and figured in the top 10.</p>
<p>The Williams team left Melbourne with no points after championship favourite Jacques Villeneuve and team mate Heinz-Harald Frentzen both failed to finish and were reduced to spectators as David Coulthard triumphed for McLaren.</p>
<p>The British team, which had gone 49 races without success, helped Coulthard to the second victory of his career and his team mate Mika Hakkinen finished third, banishing all memories of his 1995 life-threatening crash at the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide.</p>
<p>Prost was delighted with his team's placings. &quot;This is the best thing that could have happened,&quot; he said. &quot;It is going to boost everyone's confidence, especially Bridgestone's who came away with their first Formula One points and Mugen-Honda who have worked very hard over the winter.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone has been rewarded by seeing both cars reach the finish. Only one other team can claim so much. As for me, it was a nerve-wracking experience following it all as team boss from the pit wall.</p>
<p>&quot;I never found grands prix anything like so tense as this when I was a driver. But my satisfaction is much more intense. In this race we passed an important psychological barrier but the hard work has really only just begun.&quot;</p>
<p>Stewart said: &quot;I feel a mixture of joy, relief and disappointment. I feel emotional. It is quite different from racing and I have never felt like this in a car.</p>
<p>&quot;I was thrilled with the team and thrilled when I saw the cars so close to the finish, especially Rubens. But the disappointment of him not finishing is much worse than anything I remember as a driver.&quot;</p>
<p>Villeneuve, who started the race from pole position with Frentzen alongside him, was angry about the first-corner crash that wrecked his hopes.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very annoying and frustrating to throw away all the work of the weekend,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Frentzen spun out while running second with two laps to go.</p>
<p>&quot;We knew this circuit was going to be hard on the brakes but I think we didn't realise how difficult it would be and in the end they went off,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It was also an unhappy day for Briton Damon Hill's new Arrows team. Hill failed to start after suffering accelerator failure on his warm-up lap, though Brazilian Pedro Diniz finished 10th.</p>
<p>Hill was philosophical. &quot;It was just about what we expected -- but worse,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There was no sympathy for Hill from old rival Michael Schumacher who finished second in his Ferrari. &quot;You can't see that far back down the grid from where I was,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>McLaren now lead the championship with 14 points, ahead of Ferrari on six and Benetton on three.</p>
