<title>MEXICO: Mexico to investigate bank tax fraud -- Ortiz.</title>
<headline>Mexico to investigate bank tax fraud -- Ortiz.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-03-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexico Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz said on Friday the government will investigate bank officials on charges of siphoning off public tax money.</p>
<p>Some taxes paid through banks were apparently diverted enroute to Treasury coffers, Ortiz told reporters as he left a ceremony at Mexico's National Palace for Benito Juarez Day.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been some instances in which taxpayers, mostly companies, have made tax payments through banks and unfortunately there have been some banking officials...who divert the tax payments for other purposes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added that the government is investigating the instances and possible government involvement. Ortiz did not specify which banks or bankers were targeted.</p>
<p>&quot;We have gotten information from some taxpayers who said they paid their taxes and in fact they were not received by the Treasury,&quot; Ortiz said.</p>
<p>He said the ministry has not yet calculated the amount that has disappeared in the banks, but said initial estimates were &quot;very high.&quot;</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry recently launched an extensive campaign to persuade Mexicans to pay their taxes, arresting rich tax evaders and warning: &quot;Pay Your Taxes, Don't Pay the Consequences.&quot;</p>
