<p>Eighty years ago this month, in a train carriage decorated with green silk, Nicholas Romanov, tsar of all the Russias, consigned his 300-year-old dynasty to history with a brief flourish of the pen.</p>
<p>&quot;May God save Russia,&quot; read the manifesto that sealed his abdication and bequeathed the crown to his younger brother, Grand Duke Michael.</p>
<p>But imperial, Orthodox Russia was beyond saving. Michael, under heavy pressure from the revolutionaries forcing the pace of events, also abdicated just hours later.</p>
<p>The following year Nicholas, Michael and most of their close family perished at the hands of the Bolsheviks as Russia, ruled by their ancestors for centuries virtually as a private fiefdom, collapsed into civil war.</p>
<p>Marking the 80th anniversary of the 1917 revolution this year, Russians are looking with renewed fascination at the dynasty and family that for decades were reviled by the communists as the embodiment of evil.</p>
<p>ANNIVERSARY SPARKS TALK OF ROMANOVS' RETURN</p>
<p>The anniversary has stirred talk of exiled members of the Romanov family returning to live in Russia and has touched a chord of nostalgia among a population disoriented by the demise of Marxist-Leninism and a plunge in living standards.</p>
<p>A play by the popular historian Edvard Radzinsky chronicling the last days of Nicholas, his wife and their five children has attracted big audiences in Moscow and the Russian mass media has been airing the pros and cons of monarchy as an institution.</p>
<p>&quot;Just as the death of (Britain's) Queen Victoria in 1901 ushered in the 20th century it is ironic that interest in the monarchy in Russia and elsewhere is reviving on the eve of the new millenium,&quot; Yevgeny Kiselyov, anchorman of NTV commercial television's influential Itogi programme, said recently.</p>
<p>Another event this month has spurred the media's interest. Grand Duke Georgy Mikhailovich Romanov, regarded by many royalists as the true heir to the throne, turned 16 and his future career and role, if any, has become a topic of debate.</p>
<p>A recent article in Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper, widely quoted by the Russian media, suggested the Kremlin was planning to invite Georgy, who lives in Spain, to come home.</p>
<p>The report said he would be officially reinstated as head of the imperial family and live with his mother, Maria Vladimirovna, at a dacha complex outside Moscow once used by the Communist Party elite.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin's press spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said the report was absurd but some monarchists said it might be a test of public reaction.</p>
<p>MONARCHISTS SAY COUNTRY NEEDS UNIFYING FIGURE</p>
<p>&quot;Bringing the family back to Russia and full-blown restoration of the monarchy are two totally different things,&quot; said Prince Andrei Golitsyn of the Russian Noble Assembly which tries to promote the imperial cause in post-communist Russia.</p>
<p>A scion of one of Russia's old aristocratic families, Golitsyn conceded that restoring the monarchy at present was highly unlikely but said the tide might start to turn with time if Georgy and his family were allowed to settle here again.</p>
<p>&quot;These are very difficult times for Russia. A president is only elected for four years and cannot really gets to grips with the country's problems,&quot; Golitsyn told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We need a unifying symbol who could represent all Russians. In an ideal world, this would be the monarch,&quot; he said, adding that he envisaged a constitutional monarchy, not the autocratic model of Russia's past.</p>
<p>Many monarchist groups and parties have emerged in Russia over the past few years but they remain on the fringes of political life and lack wide public support.</p>
<p>A survey by NTV's Itogi programme said 13 percent of people it questioned wanted to bring back the monarchy while 65 percent opposed the idea and the rest were indifferent. Other surveys have put the number of Russia's monarchists even lower.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes we could restore the monarchy but it would not solve problems like wage arrears,&quot; said historian Radzinsky, referring to one of Russia's most pressing social issues.</p>
<p>But Golitsyn remains hopeful, saying that in their visits to Russia, Georgy and his family have encountered mostly curiosity and affection, not hostility.</p>
<p>He also cites the revival of monarchist sentiment in other former communist countries like Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p>NO CONSENSUS ABOUT WHO IS NICHOLAS'S REAL HEIR</p>
<p>But the Balkan countries were communist for a much shorter length of time than Russia and the kings who once ruled them are still alive and well, though still living in exile.</p>
<p>In contrast, Russia's monarchists are deeply divided over who is the real heir to the Romanovs and none of the claimants are direct descendants of Nicholas. Georgy derives his claim from Grand Duke Vladimir, an uncle of Nicholas who died in 1909.</p>
<p>Further undermining his claim in the eyes of some Russians, he traces this line of descent through his mother, contravening a 19th century decree that the crown could pass only from father to son or, in the absence of a son, from brother to brother.</p>
<p>The rival claims of Russia's exiled princes and dukes seem unreal and rather comical to outsiders but the popular weekly Argumenty i Fakty newspaper sounded a darker note.</p>
<p>&quot;Our politicians' playing of the monarchist card from time to time may look like a charming little diversion but it is something that should be stopped right now,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;When new 'False Dmitris' start crawling across the country's vast spaces with their armies it will be too late,&quot; said the paper, referring to Russia's Time of Troubles in the early 17th century when rival claimants vied for the throne.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's accept that our monarchical line is extinguished irretrievably,' the paper said. &quot;And let's elect our leaders.&quot;</p>
