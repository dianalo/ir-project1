<title>UK: Oil, held hostage by Iraq, rises with US gasoline.</title>

<text>
<p>Oil markets, edging higher on Tuesday, remained hostage to uncertainties surrounding the timing of Iraq's return to world oil markets.</p>
<p>Benchmark North Sea Brent blend crude futures for September closed a modest 18 cents higher in London at $18.59 a barrel, dragged higher by a surge of demand for gasoline in the United States.</p>
<p>Traders were waiting for the United Nations to approve a revised Iraqi aid distribution plan to pave the way for a resumption of oil exports under the second phase of the U.N.'s oil for aid exchange with Baghdad.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Iraq is allowed to sell up to $2 billion of oil over 180 days in two 90-day instalments.</p>
<p>After exporting about 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) over six months, when the exchange started in December, Iraq was given permission for a second round starting on June 8.</p>
<p>But Baghdad has delayed the restart of oil exports, insisting on revisions to the way aid is distributed.</p>
<p>Iraq is still hoping the U.N. will allow it to make up time lost since June 8 by putting back the start.</p>
<p>The UN insists there is no leeway on the start date.</p>
<p>Iraq has not yet made clear whether it try to sell its $1 billion allotment by September 5 and forfeit some sales or adopt another course of action.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prices found help from tight supplies of transport fuel in the gasoline-thirsty United States.</p>
<p>Traders said repairs to a gasoline making unit at Exxon's huge Baytown, Texas, refinery threatened to drain already short supply in the U.S. Gulf.</p>
<p>The unit was closed by a lightning strike.</p>
<p>Dealers were expecting the American Petroleum Institute (API) to show a one to three million barrel draw in national gasoline stocks when it releases weekly oil inventory data on Tuesday evening.</p>
