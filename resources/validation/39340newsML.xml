<p>Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis set tough fiscal targets for 1997 on Saturday and said this month's general election was crucial for the country's future in the European Union.</p>
<p>In his first major campaign speech before the September 22 election, Simitis said he would work to cut inflation by at least two percent next year and boost growth by three percent so that Greece meets European Monetary Union (EMU) targets.</p>
<p>&quot;Our country is facing a tough road ahead if it wants to achieve the targets set by the 15 EU members,&quot; he said. &quot;Our economy must progress fast to prevent its exclusion from the new European Union,&quot; he added at the opening of an international trade fair in this northern port city.</p>
<p>The Socialist Simitis, a staunchly pro-European pragmatist, said his government needed a public mandate to push ahead with spending cuts, privatisations and a radical restructuring of the public sector.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not enough to move at our own pace when the others move faster,&quot; he said. &quot;We are doing better but we still have many problems with huge state debts, along with the need to cut inflation and become competitive.&quot;</p>
<p>Greece, the worst EU economic performer, is plagued by high inflation running at an annual 8.5 percent year-on-year in August and a budget deficit of 9.0 percent of GDP last year.</p>
<p>Simitis predicted that average inflation in 1996 would be 8.2 percent and that the deficit would drop to 7.6 percent of GDP at the end of the year and to 4.2 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>The EMU target is for the deficit to drop to three percent of GDP and inflation to be cut to about two points above the average inflation of the three best performing EU members.</p>
<p>Simitis has been fighting a tough campaign against conservative opposition party leader Miltiades Evert who is promising low-income voters and farmers bold increases in salaries, pensions and services after a decade of austerity.</p>
<p>His Finance Minister, Alexandros Papadopoulos, is in the final stages of putting together next year's budget which includes cuts of $1.2 billion in state spending and the restructuring of at least 10 major public companies.</p>
<p>A poll in the Athens area this week by the private Flash radio showed Simitis enjoying an approval rating of 58.1 percent to 31.9 percent scored by Evert.</p>
<p>But poll analysts said Athens popularity ratings did not necessarily translate into votes and that a clear indication of where the electorate is going would be out next week with the first nationwide surveys.</p>
