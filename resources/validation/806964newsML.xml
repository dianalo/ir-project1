<p>The following are the leading stories in the Maltese press on Monday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>THE TIMES -  State of public finances &quot;critical&quot;. Prime  Minister Alfred Sant said on Sunday that a cabinet sub committee has been formed to study public expenditure and ensure there is value for money. He said Malta had a huge deficit due to irresponsibility and lack of planning by the Nationalist government, ousted in the October 26 general election.</p>
<p>IN-NAZZJON - Jobs drop instead of increase. The paper,  quoting unofficial figures, claims unemployment is close to 7,000.</p>
<p>L-ORIZZONT -  Government to decide soon on major  infrastructure projects. Among them is a new hospital which was originally planned by the former government but is to be extended to twice its size by this government. Prime Minister Alfred Sant said the government had to decide whether Swedish construction group Skanska would complete the whole project, or whether they would follow the original plans, with the rest of the building being decided after a fresh call for tender.</p>
