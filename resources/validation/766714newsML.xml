<p>Implied volatilities for dollar/yen options firmed as the dollar extended gains, although the shorter maturities were recoiling from early highs by U.S. midsession as spot pulled back, dealers said.</p>
<p>The longer dates were again the epicenter of frantic trading as the market braced for continued strength in the dollar, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;We've broken through key technical levels, and also with the short option positions that are there (in the higher strike prices), we're seeing a bit of a short squeeze,&quot; said Soma Rao, options sales manager at Smith Barney.  </p>
<p>He noted that the dollar crossed above its still-upsloping 200-day moving average on Tuesday near 118 yen, convincing many traders that its long-term uptrend was intact.</p>
<p>Traders said big hedge fund purchases recently of one-year yen puts with strike prices around 125 yen were having a lingering effect on the market as many interbank dealers had become short in longer-dated options.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been busy in the back-date yen,&quot; said an interbank broker in New York. &quot;With spot creeping up here toward 119 (yen), a lot of people, I think, were short and they're sort of scrambling to buy one-year at-the-money.&quot;  </p>
<p>He said sizeable trades were done in one-year dollar/yen at 12.0 to 12.05 percent implied volatility. The one-year had been quoted at 11.8/12.0 percent late on Tuesday and 11.0/11.3 last Friday.</p>
<p>Front-end volatilities jumped earlier as spot probed the 119-yen area, the highest levels since the spectacular May-June slide toward 110 yen, but quickly retraced.</p>
<p>Dealers who bought the back end were seen selling the front end to trim time decay in their postions.</p>
<p>One-month stood at 11.3/11.6 percent after rising toward 12 percent, compared with 11.4/11.7 late on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Still, growing perception that the dollar would eventually test 120 yen and higher kept risk reversals, the put/call pricing differential, steadily in favor of yen puts.</p>
<p>One-month dollar/yen risk reversal stood at 0.3/0.6 percent skewed for yen puts, little changed on the day.</p>
<p>A U.S. bank trader said mark/yen risk reversals were also beginning to show weakness in the yen as spot had bounced off last week's two-year lows below 63 yen toward the mid-64s.</p>
<p>&quot;Mark/yen risk reversals have turned around in the short dates,&quot; he said, adding that the yen calls were still favored two-month. &quot;It used to be pretty solidly for yen calls.&quot;  </p>
<p>Dollar/mark volatilities were mixed as spot consolidated in the 1.8300-1.8450 mark range.</p>
<p>&quot;The fronts are coming in with spot settling down, but the backs are still bid,&quot; the bank trader said. &quot;I think that's kind of been the story throughout (the forex market).&quot;</p>
<p>He added that shorter-dated sterling volatilities had softened as the sterling's steep downturn that started late last week appeared pausing.</p>
<p>One-month cable and sterling/mark volatilities were assessed at 9.3/9.5 and 10.8/11.1 percent respectively against 9.5/9.9 and 11.2/11.5 late on Tuesday.</p>
