<p>Japanese oil traders -- assessing the market for November cargoes -- had mixed views on how much demand would emerge in the spot market for Middle East light crudes as they begin to cover winter requirements.</p>
<p>Continued tension between Iraq and the United States, however, is unlikely to have an impact on trading trends, many market participants said.</p>
<p>&quot;(Middle East tensions) aren't likely to affect wet trading here; the nature of the market is just different from the futures market,&quot; one oil company trader said.</p>
<p>Generally, healthy demand for light crude oil emerges in the fourth quarter as oil refiners step up production of middle distillates ahead of winter.</p>
<p>Traders mostly agreed that they would see more demand for light crude oil. Some traders said the market for such crude grades could tighten in the coming months.</p>
<p>&quot;There might be all kinds of activity (in the spot market), but as far as we are concerned we need to refine middle distillates and this means that after November we'll most probably be seeking the lighter crudes,&quot; the oil company trader said.</p>
<p>However, other dealers said much of the demand might be covered by crude oil bought from oil producers under a term contract.</p>
<p>&quot;So far we have no plan to buy any light crude oil for November lifting,&quot; a trader with a second oil company said.</p>
<p>He said more light crude oil was being taken on a term basis by Japanese traders at the expressed wish of many oil producers, and that this might mean less spot demand.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the term contracts are now shifting to an emphasis on lighter crude oil,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Middle Eastern light crudes favoured by Japanese refiners for winter requirements are Murban, Umm Shaif and Lower Zakum.</p>
<p>Last year, premiums for November Murban doubled from October-lifting cargoes. The premium for November Umm Shaif rose by about six cents from October, while the premium for November Lower Zakum rose by about 10 cents.</p>
<p>Following an industry deregulation that took effect in April, Japanese oil companies are widely believed to have decided to maintain low oil product stocks in a bid to keep product prices competitive.</p>
<p>Japanese oil refiners were instead expected to step up processing when necessary to meet demand.</p>
<p>However, the second oil trader said that their middle distillates stocks were not so tight.</p>
<p>&quot;Our (middle distillate) stocks aren't low, they aren't that high but they aren't that low either,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Traders said West African crude oil also offered a possible alternative to Middle Eastern crude in terms of quality.</p>
<p>Few West African crudes, however, were likely to be shipped to the Asian market now because of the wide Brent-Dubai spread which has shut the arbitrage window, they said.</p>
<p>The November Brent-Dubai spread was notionally assessed at $2.05/2.10. The spread was below $1.00 during the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Suitable West African grades include Palanca and Bonny Light, traders aid.</p>
<p>One trading house dealer said that it was hard to forecast how the market for November-lifting cargoes would progress, but he said that so far it appeared that it would follow the usual market trend, and that light crudes will be bought.</p>
