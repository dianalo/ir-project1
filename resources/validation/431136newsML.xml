<p>British speciality chemicals group Laporte Plc on Monday reported higher-than-expected annual profits, evidence that its recovery was firmly on track.</p>
<p>Laporte, whose value tumbled in November 1995 after a shock profits warning, said pretax profit before exceptional items rose 12 percent to 127.0 million pounds ($203 million) last year, beating analysts' forecasts of between 114.3 million and 124.0 million.</p>
<p>After exceptional charges, pre-tax profits were 78.7 million pounds, compared with 24.5 million in 1995.</p>
<p>Shareholders, who saw the dividend frozen at the half-year stage, received a five percent rise in the full-year payout to 24.25 pence.</p>
<p>The results provided an early boost to Laporte's shares, which were up 18 pence at 686-1/2 in mid-morning trade after touching a high of 696 pence.</p>
<p>Laporte, whose products supply a wide range of customers including the drugs, electronics and food industries, has undergone a major shake-up since chief executive Jim Leng took the helm in October 1995.</p>
<p>Leng, forced to issue a profit warning within weeks of taking charge, introduced sweeping management changes and launched a two-year restructuring programme which included selling around one fifth of Laporte's business.</p>
<p>In December, Laporte sold most of its European adhesives business, including Evode, to France's Elf Atochem for 110 million pounds, and Leng told Reuters that it had received &quot;some initial expressions of interest&quot; for its U.S. and Italian adhesives operations.</p>
<p>Laporte, which started 1996 with debts of 180 million pounds on its books, ended the year with net cash of 13 million pounds, putting it in a strong position to start buying businesses in more proftiable sectors like electronic chemicals and performance materials.</p>
<p>But Leng said it did not intend to rush into purchases, commenting: &quot;It is not burning a hole in our pocket. We have got a business which is growing and we will carefully and analytically decide what we are going to do.&quot;</p>
<p>Leng said Laporte intended to take positions in international growth sectors which could not be entered easily by new competitors.</p>
<p>He added that Laporte was on target to achieve annual cost savings of 10 million pounds by the end of 1997 as a result of the shake-up of its operations in which 34 percent of its operating units were sold last year.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been a good all-round performance.. every business division made positive cash flow contributions,&quot; Leng said.</p>
<p>Profit margins improved to 12.9 percent overall in 1996 from 11.8 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Our target is to get closer to 15 percent and we made some good progrss on that,&quot; Leng said, adding that he wanted to reach a position where &quot;no business has less than 10 percent with the group at an average of 15 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We won't do that overnight and we won't get there this year,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Leng expects raw material prices to be fairly stable this year but said sterling's strength &quot;will dilute our progress&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;If fourth-quarter rates applied all year, it would affect profits and sales by 50 million and five million pounds, respectively,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a big challenge for UK Plc.&quot; ($ = 0.625 British Pounds)</p>
