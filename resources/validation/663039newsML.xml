<p>The French army on Monday began pulling out of the Congo Republic capital as talks on settling a bloody political dispute in France's former colony were due to start in the neighbouring West African state of Gabon.</p>
<p>The 1,200 French soldiers had helped evacuate more than 5,000 foreigners since June 5, when fighting flared between the Congo army and supporters of former military leader Denis Sassou Nguesso.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Paris rejected an appeal from Congo President Pascal Lissouba to leave its troops in the capital, Brazzaville, as a buffer force between the opposing factions.</p>
<p>A French military spokesman, Colonel Henry Pellissier, told reporters on Monday: &quot;We have already started taking out less essential equipment and in the afternoon the first troops will leave. They are already packing their bags.</p>
<p>&quot;About 300 are expected to leave today for Chad and Gabon on 16 flights. Combat units will stay until the last moment to show a presence and to ensure security at the airport.&quot;</p>
<p>Reception points in the city for evacuees who were kept there before being brought to the airport have been closed. An estimated 30 foreigners who did not make it on Sunday were to be flown out on Monday on military flights.</p>
<p>&quot;If somebody calls to us for help, then we will still pull them out even up to the last minute,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Sporadic firing of mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and machineguns could be heard around the airport through the night, but it was quiet compared to the night before.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears relatively calm at the airport today and I believe it is the same in town,&quot; the French spokesman said.</p>
<p>France is keeping its embassy open.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not contemplated closing our embassy but naturally we will take the necessary measures to ensure its protection,&quot; a Foreign Ministry spokesman in Paris said. He could not say how many soldiers would stay on to guard the embassy.</p>
<p>The conflict began when the army surrounded Sassou Nguesso's home in a crackdown on private militias and unauthorised arms in the runup to a presidential election scheduled for July 27.</p>
<p>The death toll from the fighting could run into hundreds, or even thousands according to some sources.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of bodies in the morgue is uncountable,&quot; surgeon Kibongo Nazerne said at the main University Hospital Centre. &quot;It has space for 140 bodies but there are many more than that.&quot;</p>
<p>After a two-day lull, fighting flared up again on Sunday when government loyalists rained shells down on positions held by Sassou Nguesso's Cobra militiamen from the hills behind the city's airport, prompting the militia to retaliate with mortars and tank fire.</p>
<p>Some Western analysts feared the battle would be stepped up around the airport once the French airlift was over.</p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, envoys of Lissouba and Sassou Nguesso left on the same plane for talks in Libreville, which will be hosted by Gabonese President Omar Bongo.</p>
<p>&quot;If we did not believe negotiations would work, we wouldn't be going,&quot; Lissouba representative Marius Mounbenday told Reuters.</p>
<p>Lissouba appealed for the French troops to stay on in Brazzaville until a lasting truce could be agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;I am making a fervent call. I would have liked French forces, with ourselves and those in the positions opposite us, to have formed a buffer force, to avoid exactly what is going on today,&quot; he told French television.</p>
<p>He told Radio France International the election must take place as planned and called for an African peace force to oversee polling. &quot;These elections must take place. Democracy cannot be negotiated,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sassou Nguesso did not rule out the idea of an outside force. &quot;The international community must organise the elections, check them and ensure security,&quot; he told the radio station.</p>
