<p>Israel's economy slowed further in fourth-quarter 1996 but the demand pressures that led to a rise in imports in the third-quarter eased, the Bank of Israel said in a survey of the economy released on Thursday.</p>
<p>Based on preliminary figures, the central bank indicated that the economy continued to expand in the fourth-quarter. However, the slowdown in growth that began in second-quarter 1996 grew sharper in the final three months of the year.</p>
<p>The &quot;S&quot; index of economic performance fell an average of 3.1 percent in October-December on annualised basis compared with the third-quarter. Industrial production fell at an 0.9 percent annualised rate amd imports of production inputs dropped 12 percent in dollar terms.</p>
<p>But in contrast to the third-quarter, domestic demand also contracted. The bank's index of retail sales by chains fell at a 1.7 percent annualised rate and imports of consumer goods fell at a 5.1 percent rate from a year earlier.</p>
<p>In the third-quarter, the bank said, demand continued rising at a sharp 5.3 percent annualised rate, while GDP rose at only a 2.6 percent rate. In order to meet domestic demand the trade deficit grew in the third-quarter.</p>
<p>The Bank of Israel said the inflation rate fell in the seocnd half of 1996 to a 6.8 percent annualised rate from 14.6 percent in the first half.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears the rate of price increases fell as a result of the restrictive monetary policy that was undertaken from May, a slowing in the rate of depreciation in the currency basket rate during the period and the accumulated impact of a slowdown in world-trade prices,&quot; the bank said.</p>
