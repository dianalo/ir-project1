<p>Consumer products giant Rubbermaid Inc said certain ongoing operating improvements are needed to offset near-term volatility in resin costs, but the industry expects resin costs to decline as capacity increases.  </p>
<p>Rubermaid posted first quarter earnings of $0.23 a share on net sales of $601.7 million, compared with earnings of $0.27 a share on net sales of $533.3 million last year.</p>
<p>Acquisitions, net of divestitures, contributed 14 percent of the sales growth, while core unit volume added two percent. The gains were partially offset, by three percent, from negative price realization and currency translations, the company said.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid reported gross margin of 28.1 percent, a two-percentage-point improvement over the fourth quarter but three percentage points lower than last year.  </p>
<p>The first-quarter results reflect significantly higher resin costs than last year and lower volume at Little Tikes, in part resulting from inventory overhang at retail following a slow Christmas season for traditional toys, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;Little Tikes is nearing the end of a challenging cycle after a decade-long run of growth.  The business was much smaller when we acquired it 12 years ago, and while it's now hitting its first real bump, the road is sound and aggressive strategies are in place to restore growth,&quot; said Wolfgang Schmitt, Rubbermaid's chairman.</p>
<p>Schmitt also said Rubbermaid is pursuing consolidation cost efficiencies with its vendors, including cost reductions, streamlining the supplier base and establishing global alliances with key vendors.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel that our strategies, focused on low-cost, efficient production, strong brand support, distinctive innovation and global expansion will drive improving full-year performance,&quot; Schmitt said.</p>
