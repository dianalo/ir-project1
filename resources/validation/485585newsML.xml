<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures steadied on Thursday after opening lower as the market caught up with a late sell-off in the U.S. after the Brent and gas oil markets closed, traders said.</p>
<p>May Brent was 21 cents a barrel lower at 1234 GMT and was trading at $18.30 a barrel. April IPE gas oil was $2 a tonne weaker at $163.50 a tonne, after having been called $4 to $5 lower.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing really new is happening, it is very quiet,&quot; said Fenella Graham at MeesPierson Derivatives in London. &quot;We opened in line with the late falls in the U.S.  </p>
<p>&quot;But it is extra boring so far today,&quot; she said, adding that because of the extent of Wednesday's falls, traders were uncertain of current direction and were waiting for U.S. markets to open.</p>
<p>Brent entered fresh territory on Wednesday after it forged through significant support levels to create new nine-month lows.</p>
<p>Physical markets remain well supplied.</p>
<p>&quot;Essentially the availability of crude cargoes, including the North Sea and West African barrels, is simply too high,&quot; GNI research said in a daily report.  </p>
<p>&quot;Refinery runs have been rising after turnarounds but this has been nowhere near enough to soak up the excess crude.&quot;</p>
<p>April gas oil was also steady at lower levels and Graham saw it bound in a tight range between $162.75 and $163.50, with a good chance of remaining between those levels at least until U.S. markets opened.</p>
