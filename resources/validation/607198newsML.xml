<title>THAILAND: Burma says opposition trying to create problems.</title>
<headline>Burma says opposition trying to create problems.</headline>

<p>Burma's military government said on Thursday Aung San Suu Kyi's opposition party was trying to create unnecessary problems in the country, forcing it to take strong measures against the party.</p>
<p>In its first statement since opposition officials said about 60 National League for Democracy (NLD) members had been arrested over the past few days, the government said in a faxed message to Reuters it had no choice but to take necessary preventative measures to ensure peace. It did not confirm or deny the arrests.  </p>
<p>&quot;The NLD has planned to have a so-called election anniversary in Yangon (Rangoon) on May 27. It is a very obvious political movement by the NLD to create unnecessary problems in the country and also by forcing the government to take strong measures against them so that the anti-government propaganda can be played in their favour,&quot; the statement said in response to questions from Reuters.</p>
<p>An NLD official said from Rangoon on Thursday that about 60 senior NLD politicians had been detained as they headed to the Burmese capital to attend a party meeting to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the party's election victory.</p>
<p>Burma's military government, which never recognised the results of the NLD's 1990 victory, said it could not permit any political party to disturb the peace, tranquility and stability of the nation.</p>
<p>The government made similar comments last May after it arrested about 261 senior NLD members ahead of a party congress also held to commemorate the 1990 election. It later released most of those detained, but some were charged and given long prison sentences.</p>
