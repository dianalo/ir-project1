<title>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: Irish bonds dampened by uncertainty over punt.</title>
<headline>Irish bonds dampened by uncertainty over punt.</headline>
<dateline>DUBLIN 1997-06-26</dateline>

<p>Irish bonds stayed in negative territory in slack, largely switch-driven domestic trade on Thursday, the market sidelined by question marks over the currency and awaiting the formation of a new govenment, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of debate about whether the punt is going to be revalued to meet central parity or not,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;And this uncertainty is sidelining the market at present - there is no spread trading going on and we're not going to see much movement until the currency issue is resolved.&quot;</p>
<p>As parliament meets today to elect a new prime minister, dealers said the bond market would like to see an incoming finance minister move the value of the Irish pound upwards against the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;It is increasingly likely that EMU will take place at central parity - not a problem for other European countries but a problem for Ireland at the current level of 2.41 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;A rate of, say, 2.60 would take away the downside, and we'd expect dramatic buying of Irish bonds at that level.&quot;</p>
<p>By 1500 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was down five pence at 102.05 to yield 5.93 percent, while the eight percent bond due 2006 was down 15 pence at 109.90 to yield 6.52 percent.</p>
<p>Yields against German Bunds widened from Wednesday's close at 162 basis points over in the five-year bond, and 94 over in the 10-year.</p>
<p>Dealers said trade was made up largely of switching along the curve.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen the 01 and 06 bonds become quite expensive of late, and players are searching for value in what is seen as a kind of transition period with a new government coming in.&quot;</p>
<p>The weak Irish pound has been causing Irish bonds to underperform against Spain and Italy over recent weeks, dealers said.</p>
<p>Bonds fell back across Europe on Thursday as a weak overnight performance from U.S. Treasuries dented confidence.</p>
<p>All eyes will now be on next week's exchequer returns, dealers said, which are likely to show a large budget surplus at mid-year and emphasise that there will be limited issuance of fresh stock over the balance of the year.</p>
