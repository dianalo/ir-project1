<p>From an 18th century villa in central Paris, the Netherlands Institute is trying to promote Dutch culture in France at a time when relations between the two countries have soured.</p>
<p>While French President Jacques Chirac vociferously crusades against the Netherlands' liberal drugs policy, saying it contributes to drug addiction and trafficking across Europe, the institute is seeking to win the French over to the painters, writers and musicians of the lowlands.</p>
<p>&quot;In a way we are a calling card for Dutch culture,&quot; said Lionel Veer, director of the institute.</p>
<p>&quot;But if we suffer from an image problem in France, it is not so much that we have a bad image but that we hardly have an image,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>This is now changing. An increasing number of Dutch writers are being published in French, one out of three visitors to the Vermeer exhibition in the Hague in 1996 was French and many are currently going to Amsterdam for the Jan Steen exhibition.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dutch are more concerned about a perceived bad image in France than the French are about what they think of the Dutch,&quot; Veer said.</p>
<p>DUTCH LACK CULTURE INSTITUTIONS</p>
<p>Unlike some other countries, the Netherlands does not have a policy of actively promoting its culture abroad through a network of institutions in foreign capitals.</p>
<p>France has the Maison Descartes and other institutes, Germany its Goethe Institutes, Britain its British Councils and Italy the Dante Aleghieri houses.</p>
<p>The Netherlands only has a mixed bag of small university departments in places like Rome, Florence, Cairo, Istanbul and Tokyo as well as the Erasmus language institute in Jakarta, Indonesia, and the Institut Neerlandais in Paris.</p>
<p>This institute, celebrating its 40th anniversary this year, was founded by a Dutch art dealer and collector based in France, Frits Lugt.</p>
<p>Lugt, who also worked in the Louvre museum as an art historian, had compiled an extensive collection of drawings by Rembrandt and when he returned to France after World War Two he sought a way to preserve his collection.</p>
<p>He bought two adjacent buildings -- the 18th century villa Hotel Turgot, where the finance minister of Louis XV died, and the 19th century Hotel Levis Mirepoix -- and transfered his collection and the property to a private foundation.</p>
<p>Then he offered the Netherlands the free use of the building as a cultural outpost but the deal took until 1957 to materialise. The Netherlands obtained its institute in Paris and Lugt managed to avoid paying tax on his possessions.</p>
<p>MORE THAN 20,000 VISITORS LAST YEAR</p>
<p>Opened on January 11, 1957, by French President Rene Coty and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, the institute organises exhibitions, concerts and lectures.</p>
<p>In 1996, more than 20,000 people visited its various exhibitions, some 400 French people studied Dutch at the institute's courses and its small but specialised art library had seven visitors per day.</p>
<p>A mainstay of the institute is the Lugt collection of drawings including the Rembrandt work, estimated to be worth some 400 million guilders ($228 million).</p>
<p>The collection owned by a private foundation which Lugt endowed, not the Institute.</p>
<p>Lugt's children and grandchildren recently decided to contest the will and the future of the collection is uncertain.</p>
<p>Lugt had married rich and his descendants include members of the Fentener van Vlissingen family, one of the most wealthy Dutch trading families, which owns the SHV trading conglomerate and Makro stores.</p>
<p>Veer's ambition is to interest the French in more forms of Dutch culture than painting and music.</p>
<p>DUTCH KNOWN MORE FOR THE OLD THAN THE NEW</p>
<p>The French mainly associate Dutch culture with the 17th century landscape painters and are often surprised to hear that Vincent van Gogh was Dutch, not French.</p>
<p>Of modern artists, names like painter Karel Appel and photographer Jan Dibbets may have some familiarity.</p>
<p>Writers like novelist Cees Nooteboom and historian Hella Haasse are selling reasonably well in French, but a writer like Harry Mulisch -- very well known in the Netherlands and gaining popularity in the U.S. -- is not.</p>
<p>Veer aims to promote Dutch culture by trying to interest art dealers and museums in France to exhibit artists from the Netherlands. He also plans to tickle the French by showing the Dutch background of some artists France has adopted as its own.</p>
<p>For the anniversary exhibition, starting in April, the Institut Neerlandais will show drawings and watercolours of Kees Van Dongen.</p>
<p>He was a naturalised French artist, famous for his celebrity portraits at the turn of the century, who was born in Rotterdam in 1877.</p>
<p>To mark the Dutch presidency of the European Union in the first half of 1997, which aims to conclude the Treaty of Amsterdam for monetary and economic union, the Institute Neerlandais is hosting a series of meetings on closer cooperation in areas such as police work -- an item that will not displease the French president.</p>
