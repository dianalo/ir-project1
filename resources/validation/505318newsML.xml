<title>PHILIPPINES: San Miguel defends Coke Amatil deal.</title>

<p>Philippine food and beverage firm San Miguel Corp (SMC) said on Sunday the deal between its Coca-Cola subsidiary and Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA) was both fair and made sense.</p>
<p>News of the proposed merger hit the shares of San Miguel A and B in the local bourse early last week on perceptions by some investors that it was disadvantageous to SMC.</p>
<p>Both shares recovered later in the week, with San Miguel A closing 1.00 peso up and San Miguel B finishing 50 centavos up at the close of trade on Friday.  </p>
<p>Under the deal, which is expected to be completed in June, SMC will sell 70 percent owned subsidiary Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc (CCBPI) in exchange for 25 percent stake in CCA.</p>
<p>Sydney-based CCA is one of Coca-Cola's largest bottlers with a total consumer base of 380 million in 17 countries.</p>
<p>SMC said in a press statement the agreement in principle with CCA was made after &quot;intense valuation processes.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;We looked into each and every country, into each growth prospect. We broke our valuations down to the growth in population, to the growth in per capita consumption level, to growth in margins on a per country basis over a 10-15 year horizon,&quot; SMC senior vice president Alberto de Larrazabal said in the statement.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a lot of detailed evaluations into the valuations and we feel that they are fair,&quot; Larrazabal said.  </p>
<p>The statement said a concern that caused &quot;negative&quot; investor perception was SMC's exchange of holdings from CCBPI to a lower percentage of Amatil, a company whose profitability, the statement said, was perceived to be not as good as CCBPI's.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason why the profitability of Amatil is not as good as ours is largely because they've been investing very heavily in consolidating their positions in their varied growth markets, in the infrastructures for growth,&quot; Larrazabal said.</p>
<p>Similar to what happened to SMC on its investments in China, &quot;that tends to depress income during the short term. But any investment in growth requires this type of situation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Larrazabal added: &quot;The soft drinks industry is one that is driven by volume. It is when you've got large volumes that you truly start to make a lot of money. That's San Miguel's experience. That's when the logic of an anchor bottler really starts to make sense.&quot;</p>
