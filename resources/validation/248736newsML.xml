<p>Zaire said on Wednesday it was not aware of any negotiations to bring in mercenaries or Angolan UNITA fighters but that it did not rule out seeking military help from allies to regain territory seized by rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;If we are obliged even to work with the devil himself we will do so in order to win back Zaire's territorial integrity,&quot; government spokesman Boguo Makele told Reuters.</p>
<p>But Boguo said the time for such military help had not yet arrived. He denied reports that a battalion of fighters of Angola's UNITA rebel group had already arrived in Zaire to back up floundering efforts by the army to halt rebel advances.</p>
<p>Reports of a UNITA link have appeared in the Belgian press.</p>
<p>Throughout years of civil war in Angola, Zaire was used as the principal base for supplying arms to Jonas Savimbi's UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola).</p>
<p>There has been persistent talk in Kinshasa in recent weeks that UNITA has already begun operations to return the favour.</p>
<p>Rwandan-backed rebels have taken over a string of strategic towns and airstrips in the east of the country, and now control large parts of North and South Kivu provinces.</p>
<p>Poorly trained and paid, Zairean soldiers have proved incapable of defending territory and have turned to looting.</p>
<p>The latest rebel attacks have centred around the town of Bunia, bordering gold-rich areas of Upper Zaire Province.</p>
<p>Boguo said the town was still in the hands of the Zairean army on Tuesday. The government was in contact with military officers and traditional leaders there, he said.</p>
<p>Rebels say they have encircled remaining army troops there.</p>
<p>Zaire's main Western ally, France, has so far failed to win support for a multinational military intervention force under U.N. auspices. Now, even some Zairean army officers see hiring outside help as the army's only hope of regaining lost land.</p>
<p>Boguo, who is information minister, denied rumours that the government was negotiating a deal with South African mercenaries from Pretoria firm, Executive Outcomes, to help protect mines.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know of any mercenaries negotiating with the Zairean government. If the state mining company, or even foreign mining companies were undertaking such negotiations they would have to do so with the government's permission,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The South African mercenaries helped governments of Angola and Sierra Leone regain the upper hand in war with rebels.</p>
<p>Boguo, however, said many African states had declared willingness to cooperate with Zaire to protect its frontiers.</p>
<p>Zaire says neighbours Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda have invaded and that Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila is a puppet in the hands of an expansionist ethnic Tutsi coalition.</p>
<p>Banyamulenge Tutsis whose ancestors immigrated from Rwanda took up arms in October, initially to defend their citizenship rights. Kabila now says the objective is to overthrow the government of President Mobutu Sese Seko, in power for 31 years.</p>
<p>The rebellion erupted while Mobutu was away in Europe for cancer surgery and rest. His close aides say he will return to Kinshasa next week to take charge.</p>
<p>At last week's Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso and at an earlier Central African heads of state meeting in Congo, many allies came out in support of Zaire's position, Boguo said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although we don't yet envisage asking our allies to come to our help with troops, the idea has not been ruled out,&quot; he said</p>
<p>Mobutu has turned to foreign allies for help when faced with similar military disaster in the past.</p>
