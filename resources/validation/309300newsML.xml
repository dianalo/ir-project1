<p>Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda will meet Reserve Bank of India governor C. Rangarajan in Bombay this week, a Finance Ministry spokeswoman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, the spokeswoman denied a newspaper report that Deve Gowda and the central bank chief would discuss the state of the nation's capital markets at the meeting.</p>
<p>The Economic Times reported on Wednesday that Deve Gowda had convened a series of high-level meetings in Bombay for Friday &quot;to discuss the liquidity crunch in the industry and capital markets reforms&quot;.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is no meeting to prop up the markets as such,&quot; the spokeswoman said, noting that Deve Gowda planned to be in Bombay for several separate engagements.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister will happen to be in Bombay,&quot; she said. &quot;The RBI governor is going to call on him. It will be a courtesy call.&quot;</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said the meeting between Deve Gowda and the central bank governor &quot;has been blown out of proportion&quot;.</p>
<p>A government spokesman said Deve Gowda's programme in Bombay had not yet been finalised and he could go there on Thursday or Friday.</p>
