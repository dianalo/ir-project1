<p>Bombay share prices closed modestly higher on Friday after positive results by market major Reliance pushed up prices, traders said.</p>
<p>The petrochemical major beat analysts lower profits forecast for the six months to September 30, 1996/97 (April-March), by posting a three percent rise in net profit.</p>
<p>The 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) staged a small rally at close to end 18.88 points or 0.61 points higher to a provisional 3,130.90.</p>
<p>Share of Reliance rose 2.0 rupees to 196.75 on volumes of over 4.9 million shares at the BSE.  </p>
<p>The company reported a net profit of 6.51 billion rupees against its year-ago figure of 6.33 billion rupees.</p>
<p>Analysts were expecting higher costs, lower product prices and flat volume growth to supress its profits by 20-25 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is actually baffled,&quot; said Jal Irani, analyst at Jardine Fleming Broking India. &quot;I am surprised,&quot; said analyst Prakash Joshi at W.I.Carr (Far East) in Bombay.</p>
<p>But, they said the firm's decision not to provide for a 12.9 percent minimum tax imposed in India's July federal budget on non-tax paying companies partly explained its good results.  </p>
<p>The 50-stock National Stock Exchange index gained 4.74 points or 0.53 percent to a provisional close of 896.74.</p>
<p>ABB dropped 17.50 or 2.28 percent o 749.50 after a bonus issue announcement fell short of market expectations.</p>
<p>The firm on Thursday announced a bonus equity issue of one share for every three shares held.</p>
<p>Dealers said purchases of SBI by UTI, the country's largest mutual fund, helped the stock record gains.</p>
<p>SBI rose 8.75 to 208.75, TELCO 1.75 to 422.0, Bajaj Auto 12.450 to 939.0 and Hind Lever 11.0 to 805.25.</p>
<p>The BSE will be closed on Monday due to a Hindu holiday.</p>
