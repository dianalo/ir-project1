<p>Sipping coffee in a gloomy Internet cafe on a winter afternoon, science fiction guru William Gibson -- the man who coined the word &quot;cyberspace -- confesses he finds the computers around him, well, boring.</p>
<p>&quot;This technology, it's all obsolete. Computers are like ice sculptures in terms of obsolesence,&quot; the 48-year-old author said, watching people tapping intently on keyboards.</p>
<p>Idolized by Internet groupies, Gibson invented the term &quot;cyberspace&quot; in a 1982 short story and vaulted to cult status with his award-winning first novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot; in 1984.</p>
<p>Although his books have sold millions of copies, he is no sci-fi hack. Critics have lavished praise on him and many technophiles view him as one of the digital age's most visionary thinkers, alongside Microsoft founder Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Gibson, whose short story &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; was made into a 1995 movie, published his latest book &quot;Idoru&quot; last year and is now writing a screenplay for &quot;Neuromancer.&quot; After that, he plans to start his sixth novel.</p>
<p>Although technology is at the heart of the often-bleak future world of his stories, Gibson keeps it at arm's length. He wrote &quot;Neuromancer&quot; on a clunky 1927 typewriter and only recently graduated to writing on a computer. He shuns e-mail.</p>
<p>&quot;I was really lucky when I started writing because I knew nothing about computers,&quot; the Vancouver-based writer told Reuters. &quot;I didn't have a lot of preconceptions.&quot;</p>
<p>IMAGINATION ROAMS FREE</p>
<p>This has allowed his imagination to roam free.</p>
<p>Gibson's early work envisioned global computer networks, virtual reality, hackers, pirated software and electronic cash before any of them actually existed. He had little inkling how computer networks would take the world by storm when he coined the term &quot;cyberspace&quot; 14 years ago. Now in the Oxford English Dictionary, it describes the digital world of computers and electronic communication where geography no longer exists.</p>
<p>The word &quot;has the currency it does because it turned out to actually describe something people need to describe every day. Cyberspace is where the bank keeps your money or where you 'are' during a phone call,&quot; Gibson said. &quot;It's increasingly where a large part of what passes for civilized activity these days actually happens.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Idoru,&quot; his new book, is set in the twilight urban landscape of a post-earthquake Tokyo and includes buildings that construct themselves, a romance between an aging Chinese-Irish rock star and a computer-generated beauty and an experimental drug that compels users to murder only celebrities and politicians.</p>
<p>NOT JUST ESCAPIST FANTASY</p>
<p>For all his mind-bending images of the future, Gibson does not intend his work to be merely escapist fantasy. He aims instead to prod readers to ponder the chaotic world of today.</p>
<p>The tall, lanky author leans forward in his chair, staring fixedly into his coffee cup, as he searches for the right words to describe his mission.</p>
<p>&quot;I often think that in my work I am actually attempting to explore an unthinkable present. We have to ask ourselves what is holding the world together,&quot; he said, his faint accent betraying his origins in the American South. &quot;I am trying to induce a vertigo ... so that for a few hours people will walk outside and see things a little differently.&quot;</p>
<p>Born in South Carolina, Gibson grew up in the mountains of southwestern Virgina with his widowed mother and attended boarding school in Arizona. He left the United States at 19 for Canada to avoid the Vietnam War draft. Married, with two teen-age children, he has lived in Vancouver since 1972.</p>
<p>He admits to being more than a little puzzled by today's world where the artificial seems increasingly to supplant the real. This confusion, he says, is an important theme in his work.</p>
<p>&quot;The nature of reality in a hyper-mediated world is something I keep coming back to. It's all increasingly fuzzy, what is real and what is Memorex,&quot; he said. &quot;If I could define reality, I would have run out of ideas for writing these books.&quot;</p>
