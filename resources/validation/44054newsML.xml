<title>USA: U.S. soybean ratings slip as dryness stresses crop.</title>
<headline>U.S. soybean ratings slip as dryness stresses crop.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-09-10</dateline>

<p>U.S. soybean ratings declined in the week ended Sunday as warm, dry weather sapped much needed moisture from plants during the critical pod fill stage, weekly crop updates showed.</p>
<p>&quot;With the combination of moisture stress and late planting, we're gradually coming to the realization that it (a bumper crop) just isn't going to happen,&quot; said Kerry Siekmann of the Minnesota Agricultural Statistics Service.</p>
<p>The National Agricultural Statistics Service rated 55 percent of the U.S. soybean crop good to excellent, down from the previous week's level of 57 percent.  </p>
<p>In Minnesota, above normal temperatures aided soybean development but condition ratings fell sharply due to moisture stress, Siekmann said.</p>
<p>The crop rated good to excellent fell to 49 percent from 56 percent the previous week.</p>
<p>Topsoil moisture was rated 44 percent adequate to surplus, down from 53 percent the previous week, the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw a lot of late planting of soybeans,&quot; he said. &quot;With the weather starting to turn (colder), some of them are going to run out of time to be mature before the first frost hits us.&quot;  </p>
<p>In Illinois, the second-largest soybean producing state in 1995, soybean ratings dropped two points despite a week of warm temperatures and much-needed sunshine, said Harvey Roemer, Illinois Agricultural Statistics Service statistician.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it was the limited amount of rain&quot; that caused the lower ratings, Roemer said. &quot;The vast majority of the state has simply been dry. Some (pods) are already starting to abort.&quot;</p>
<p>Illinois' soybean development was behind the average pace with 14 percent turning color as of Sunday compared with the five-year average of 43 percent.  </p>
<p>In Ohio, warm, dry weather aggravated moisture stress, causing soybean conditions to decline for the second straight week, the state's statistical service said.</p>
<p>&quot;The best soybean ratings were reported in southern Ohio where only a few acres are grown,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Ohio's crop was rated 36 percent good to excellent, against 38 percent the previous week and 65 percent last year at this time.</p>
<p>Iowa's soybeans were rated 72 percent good to excellent, well above the national average. But development remained slow as 14 percent of the leaves had turned color as of Sunday against the state average of 33 percent.</p>
