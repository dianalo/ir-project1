<p>China's recent interest rate cuts were likely to provide new opportunities for unauthorised fund raising schemes, the Financial News said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The newspaper said that some firms were offering interest of around 20 percent on illegally collected funds compared with bank interest of 7.47 percent earned on one-year fixed deposits.</p>
<p>The central bank has cut interest rates twice in less than four months. The most recent cut on August 23 trimmed interest on bank deposits by an average of 1.5 percentage points.</p>
<p>&quot;After the rate cut, fund-raisers will lure large numbers of people through higher interest rates,&quot; the newspaper said in an editorial.</p>
<p>Many small-sized firms outside big cities were having difficulty getting bank loans and faced capital shortages, it said. China's state banks have increased financial support to state firms, but loans were made chiefly to selected large-sized state entreprises mainly in big cities.</p>
<p>The rate cut would allow smaller firms without access to official credits to raise funds through unofficial channels to make up for their credit shortfalls.</p>
<p>It did not give details, although it said such illegal fund-raising hurt state banks and could affect social stability.</p>
