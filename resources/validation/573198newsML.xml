<title>USA: Kempton honored by New York writers, mayor.</title>
<headline>Kempton honored by New York writers, mayor.</headline>

<p>More than 400 people from New York's political, journalistic and literary world crammed into a Manhattan church Thursday to honour Murray Kempton, the Pulitzer prize-winning New York newspaper columnist and author who died Monday.</p>
<p>Seventy-nine bells tolled to mark his age at his death at the simple ceremony at St. Ignatius Episcopal Church of Antioch on Manhattan's upper westside, near his home.</p>
<p>New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as well as former Mayor David Dinkins joined the mourners made up mainly of journalists, authors, publishers and film producers as well as politicians who had known Kempton during his long career.</p>
<p>The crowd flowed onto the streets when there was no more standing room and included Pete Hamill, editor-in-chief of the New York Daily News, commentator, William F. Buckley Jr., producer-writer Nora Ephron, historian Arthur Schlesinger, columnist Jimmy Breslin and Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger.</p>
<p>The ceremony was dictated by Kempton in a &quot;My Funeral&quot; note he wrote in 1989. He chose the hymns -- the verses from his own copy of the 1559 &quot;Common Book of Common Prayer.&quot;</p>
<p>He excluded all eulogies and said his name should not be mentioned outside of the common prayer. If there had to be music, he said he preferred the Sanctus and the Agnus Dei from Byrd and Purcell &quot;which will, to be sure, have been spoken elsewhere but deserve two hearings if anything in the language does.&quot;</p>
<p>Kempton, whose erudite articles brought a gentle voice to a tough city, worked for the New York Post, the New York Review of Books, the New York World Telegram and Newsday of Long Island.</p>
<p>He wrote about individuals at important moments in history, including communists, labour leaders, mobsters, movie stars and baseball players. He worked as a publicity director, writer, labour reporter and editor, assistant editor, columnist and free-lance writer.</p>
