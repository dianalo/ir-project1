<p>Porto were fined 100,000 Swiss Francs ($68,000) on Tuesday after UEFA found them responsible for the serious crowd control problems at their European Cup match against Manchester United on March 19.</p>
<p>In a statement issued on Tuesday, UEFA, European soccer's ruling body said: &quot;FC Porto was held responsible for the problems in connection with the Champions' League quarter-final against Manchester United.</p>
<p>&quot;Due to a serious lack of organisation, the Portuguese club were fined 100,000 Swiss francs.&quot;</p>
<p>UEFA also want Porto to make safety and security improvements at the Antas stadium where the trouble took place.</p>
<p>&quot;The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Committee will submit the whole file of this case to the UEFA Stadia committee in order to realise the necessary improvements,&quot; said the statement. Several Manchester United fans were hurt after police opened fire with anti-riot pellets during disturbances at the game.</p>
<p>Officials at the Sao Jorge hospital later said six or seven English fans had been brought in from the Antas stadium with plastic pellet wounds, including one supporter who had been hit in the head.</p>
<p>Police had battled  to restrain a crowd of United fans trying to leave the ground as the match, in which the English champions clinched a place in the European Cup semifinals, was drawing to a close.</p>
<p>The  game ended 0-0 but United coasted through on aggregate, having trounced Porto 4-0 in the first leg in Manchester.</p>
<p>The fans had ignored a police warning that they should remain in the ground for at least 45 minutes after the game to give local Porto supporters time to clear the stadium.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the police also used batons and tear gas to force back the dozens of fans converging on the exit. Police said some 15 officers were also slightly injured in the clashes, but no arrests were made.</p>
<p>It was the second incident of the night involving the visiting supporters.</p>
<p>Earlier, 20 United fans were hurt, including three who were taken to hospital. Most had cuts and bruises after clashing with riot police in a disturbance outside the stadium.</p>
<p>Porto could be in more trouble on Wednesday when UEFA annouce their findings into an alleged bribery scandal involving Porto over a period of years.</p>
