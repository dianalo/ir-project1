<p>Business ties are better and the trade gap is shrinking but Europe has not dropped economic issues from its agenda with Japan, European Commission President Jacques Santer said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;At the business level, our relations have steadily improved,&quot; Santer told a news conference. &quot;Of course this should not hide that there exist areas where progress is still necessary and where further efforts need to be made.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We witness that our trade balance has improved, but several market access issues remain to be solved,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Santer, wrapping up a five-day visit to Japan that included talks with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and business leaders, urged Japan to forge ahead with cutting the red tape which critics say strangles the economy and dampens imports.</p>
<p>&quot;Progress has been made in reducing the regulatory burden on firms... I wish the momentum behind the deregulation process continues beyond the current three-year programme,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Santer's visit came against the backdrop of a shrinking in Europe's trade deficit with Tokyo. The European Union has been slowly whittling down the trade gap, which fell to $26 billion last year after soaring to above $40 billion in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Brussels, while insisting it is not letting up on trade, also wants Tokyo to take a higher-profile role on the world diplomatic stage.</p>
<p>The annual EU-Japan summit on Monday covered a broad range of topics including the global battle against organised crime, United Nations reform, Bosnia, the Middle East peace process, ties with China and Russia and the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>&quot;We have gone beyond economic relations to encompass also...the political dimension,&quot; Santer said. &quot;We have converging interests in the world, therefore I think a new partnership is developing.&quot;</p>
<p>Among those mutual interests is support for multilateral trade rules.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Japan and the European Union have the same interest to oppose unilateralist tendencies of some other partners,&quot; he said in an apparent reference to the United States' penchant for resorting to unilateral sanction threats in trade spats.</p>
<p>Santer reiterated his assurances that Europe is on track for the introduction of a new single currency from January 1, 1999, and said he was confident that a &quot;substantial number&quot; of nations would join Europe's Economic and Monetary Union in the initial stage.</p>
<p>Several European countries have recently announced plans to bring their 1997 budgets in line with the strict fiscal benchmarks laid out in the treaty on European economic unity forged in the Dutch city of Maastricht in 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;There is not only political willingness, but also concrete results,&quot; Santer said.</p>
