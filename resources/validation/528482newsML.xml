<p>President Bill Clinton left for North Dakota on Tuesday to view vast flood damage, saying the government response needed to be &quot;very creative.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton told reporters he would &quot;pledge our nation's support, (and) see that we can do everything we can do to help&quot; those affected. He said he would work with Congress to provide a package of aid.</p>
<p>He was due to fly by helicopter over Grand Forks, North Dakota, whose 50,000 inhabitants were evacuated after 90 percent of the city was inundated by the swollen Red River.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to Our Nightmare,&quot; read a front-page headline in the Grand Forks Herald in advance of Clinton's arrival.</p>
<p>Leaving the White House, Clinton said: &quot;If you look at Grand Forks, you see a place that literally has to be completely rebuilt or people have to reconstitute their lives elsewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So, I do believe that we are going to have to be prepared to be very creative here.&quot;</p>
<p>He had been asked if he saw a need for a domestic &quot;Marshall Plan,&quot; a reference to the U.S.-financed reconstruction of Europe after World War II.</p>
<p>&quot;I personally can't remember a time when a community that large was entirely evacuated,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had disasters that have affected more people. But I believe that probably this is the highest percentage ... in any state or community that I have seen affected by this.&quot;</p>
<p>The Democratic president said he would work with the Republican-led Congress to ensure relief for the region.</p>
<p>&quot;The Congress has shown in the past, even when it was quite costly after the earthquake in California for example, that we can unite across party lines to do what has to be done,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said he would meet North Dakota's congressional delegation when he returns to Washington to work on a plan.</p>
<p>&quot;I think everybody in America has been totally overwhelmed by what we have seen on television and seen in the news reports,&quot; Clinton said, citing images of the abandoned city -- part of it engulfed in flames -- totally surrounded by water.</p>
<p>North Dakota's governor, Ed Schafer, said he was hoping Clinton would bring a major aid package.</p>
<p>&quot;We hear he's going to announce a major rebuilding project up here, but we're anxiously awaiting what the news is,&quot; he said before Clinton's visit.</p>
<p>Besides the destruction in Grand Forks, hundreds of people were evacuated from Drayton, 40 miles to the north, where a cracked dike threatened to give way. Hundreds more left Pembina, and about 750 people across the Canadian border in Emerson, Manitoba, fled their homes.</p>
