<headline>Chemicals push Hungary's BUX to new high.</headline>

<p>Hungarian shares extended their gains, pushing the BUX index to a third successive peak on the Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) on Tuesday on the back of record highs on major foreign markets, traders said.</p>
<p>The BUX index closed at 3,692.06 points, up 9.88.</p>
<p>&quot;Positive developments on foreign share markets had their impact here,&quot; said Zsolt Katona of ING Barings.</p>
<p>In harmony with trader expectations chemical firms took the spotlight on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Trading in Borsodchem resumed after Monday's suspension, with prices surging to a new high of 3,185 forints before closing at 3,100 forints, up 115.</p>
<p>The BSE suspended trading in Borsodchem shares on Monday to protect investors who did not know that the international private offer of 1.2 million Borsodchem shares was closed following the fixing of the issue price at 2,940 forints/share or $18.50/GDR.</p>
<p>Trading in Borsodchem shares became very active as its price soared in line with its SEAQ quotation, which was also above the issue price, traders said.</p>
<p>TVK strengthened on the back of Borsodchem's rise but the fact that its supply side raised its offer limit also contributed to higher prices.</p>
<p>TVK peaked at 1,400 forints and ended at 1,390, up 15.</p>
<p>Oil company MOL closed at 1,750 forints, up five, but below the day's peak of 1,770 forints. However, the news that it made an encouraging oil discovery in Tunisia, may have had a beneficial impact on its price, traders said.</p>
<p>The bourse's outlook is positive but Katona said the market is expected to undergo some downward correction later this year before rebounding to current levels by year-end.</p>
