<p>Iraq's President Saddam Hussein has put his wife under house arrest and his son, wounded in a Dec. 12 shooting in Baghdad, may lose a leg to gangrene, a senior U.S. military official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The official, who asked not to be identified, told reporters that sources indicated Saddam was now moving around even more frequently for his personal security.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that's an indication that his own personal safety from his own psyche is not as secure,&quot; said the official, familiar with the situation in Iraq and the Gulf region.</p>
<p>Briefing reporters on the situation in the Gulf, the official said &quot;I think it's very interesting that Saddam has just put his wife under house arrest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is a report by a good source -- that his wife is under house arrest.&quot;</p>
<p>The official gave no details on when or why Saddam's wife might have been restricted but suggested a shooting attack on Saddam's son, Uday, last month might have prompted the president's increased fear for his own safety.</p>
<p>Uday, 32, was seriously wounded in the attack as he drove through Baghdad. Published reports have suggested the motive for the attack to be either a business or family feud.</p>
<p>&quot;Uday has been hit very, very hard and has one or two bullets left in his spine and is semi-paralysed,&quot; the official said. &quot;He may lose his leg from gangrene.&quot;</p>
<p>The official said Saddam's military forces had increased their training in recent weeks but there was no indication Iraq might repeat the attack on Kuwait that prompted the smashing of Saddam's forces by a U.S.-led military coalition in the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>The official said a high source in Baghdad reported that Saddam was convinced he could re-capture Kuwait in a surprise attack. Saddam reportedly considered and rejected the idea daily.</p>
<p>&quot;If properly planned, he could (re-capture Kuwait),&quot; the senior defence official said, but added such an attempt would be at peril from more than 200 U.S. and allied warplanes and strong naval forces in the Gulf region.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not saying that's going to happen, but I'm suggesting to you that's the margin of error that we've lived on now nigh three years of trying to balance the threat against the forces available,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>He said sources indicated Saddam was now moving about more frequently between Baghdad, West Baghdad and the city of Tikrit north of Baghdad.</p>
<p>The official told reporters he did not feel Saddam was in danger of losing control of his country. &quot;I don't think he (Saddam) is in any risk of losing control because I've been through it so many times and he hasn't.&quot;</p>
