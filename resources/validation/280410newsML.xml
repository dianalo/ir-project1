<headline>Chile blue chips close year with fresh decline.</headline>
<dateline>SANTIAGO 1996-12-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Ending a year of sharp declines, Chilean stocks closed lower in the last trading day of 1996, with the launch of supermarket chain D&amp;S the only bright spot in otherwise flat trade, dealers said on Monday.</p>
<p>No clear trend is seen for the opening on Thursday, when trading is due to resume, they said. &quot;With stocks so listless, it is hard to see much change on Thursday,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The bolsa closed early on Monday at 1400 local (1700 GMT) and will stay shut Tuesday for a financial holiday. It will reopen Thursday at 0930 local (1230 GMT) after New Year's Day.</p>
<p>The  .IPSA index ended down 0.61 percent at 88.21 points.  </p>
<p>The general .IGPA index shed 0.34 percent to 4,904.62 points.</p>
<p>Turnover climbed to 27.7 billion pesos, of which 21 billion pesos was from the sale of 90 million shares in D&amp;S.</p>
<p>Blue chip stocks tumbled 17 percent in real terms in 1996. The decline reflected high local interest rates and a drought that hurt electricity stocks, traders said.</p>
<p>Investors fear that the drought will hammer earnings of Chilean power-generating companies, which are buying expensive power on the spot market to make up for the shortfall in production at their own hydroelectric plants.  </p>
<p>Among the power companies, Endesa -- one of the bourse's biggest blue-chip losers this year -- touched a year-low of 210 pesos before recovering to close at 211 pesos.</p>
<p>Other losers included telecommunications company Entel, down four percent at 2,880 pesos, and papermaker CMPC, which fell 2.77 percent at 4,570 pesos.</p>
<p>Gainers included forestry company Masisa, up 2.14 percent at 191 pesos, and telecom Telex, which firmed 1.11 percent to 1,000 pesos.</p>
