<p>French stocks opened slightly higher on Thursday in a half-hearted rebound from the previous day's 1.7 percent fall.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is fragile,&quot; a trader said. He said the Paris bourse would fluctuate in line with the dollar and bond markets, both of which came off their earlier highs.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was up 2.97 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,216.25 at 0925 GMT. It has lost around 140 points in the past week after testing record highs. The December CAC-40 futures contract was up three points at 2,218.</p>
<p>Retail shares were active on renewed merger speculation.</p>
<p>Most-frequently mentioned takeover target Casino was up 2.3 percent after giant Carrefour moved on Wednesday to buy 33 percent of holding company of the Cora chain. Carrefour shares rose 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>French minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin fanned the speculation by saying in a newspaper interview that he expected further consolidation in the sector.</p>
<p>Thomson-CSF shares jumped 2.47 percent after the Finance Ministry announced on Wednesday night that it would relaunch the Thomson privatisation, beginning with the sale of the 58-percent owned Thomson-CSF defence electronics unit.</p>
