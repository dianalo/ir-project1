<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin feels better than his doctors had expected after his bypass operation, his press secretary said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;He surprises doctors with his good state,&quot; Sergei Yastrzhembsky said by telephone from his Kremlin office. &quot;He feels quite well for this stage.&quot;  </p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky also said Yeltsin signed a decree at 6 a.m. (0300 GMT) saying he was taking back the presidential powers he transferred to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin for the period of his heart operation.</p>
<p>The doctors who operated on Yeltsin were due to meet at 9 a.m. (0600 GMT) to review his progress.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, recovered consciousness on Tuesday evening after the quintuple bypass operation, which lasted seven hours.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether the doctors had yet taken him off a ventilator.</p>
