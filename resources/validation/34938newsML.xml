<p>The PLO and Israel said on Thursday that the Arafat-Netanyahu handshake had saved Middle East peace.</p>
<p>But officials who helped bring about the first meeting of the Palestinian and Israeli leaders on Wednesday acknowledged that the two sides were still far apart on all major issues.</p>
<p>The handshake marked a milestone in the political and psychological life of both men -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israel's new Likud Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>For Arafat, Netanyahu was a scion of revisionist Zionists bent on colonizing all of pre-1948 Palestine. For Netanyahu, the PLO chief and former guerrilla was a &quot;terrorist&quot;.</p>
<p>U.S. and international mediators struggling to keep the 1993 Palestinian self-rule deal alive seized on the symbolism of the meeting as evidence of progress.</p>
<p>&quot;For one thing, it crosses what I would consider a psychological threshold,&quot; said U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross. &quot;If you're going to tackle real issues of substance, you have to develop working relationships,&quot; he told Israel Television.</p>
<p>The United States had been urging Netanyahu to meet Arafat since he narrowly beat a centre-left Labour government in May elections.</p>
<p>The right-wing Likud party leader hesitated, arousing Palestinian fears that he wanted to rewrite the Olso accord that the late Labour prime minister Yitzhak Rabin sealed with a handshake with Arafat on the White House lawn three years ago.</p>
<p>Aides to Arafat and Netanyahu put a positive spin for their domestic audiences on the outcome of their bosses' one-hour summit.</p>
<p>Israelis stressed that self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank could not go ahead unless their security needs were satisfied. Palestinians said they had not given in to Israeli demands to modify Oslo, only to discuss its implementation.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the kind of double talk we've heard before,&quot; said Palestinian political analyst Khalil Shikaki.</p>
<p>&quot;The statements on implementing Oslo were followed by Israeli reservations about security. There was no progress on substantive issues,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;Ordinary Palestinians want to see changes on the ground before they will believe the peace agreement is working again.&quot;</p>
<p>Those changes would include implementing Oslo clauses on an Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron and other areas of the West Bank, opening a passage for Palestinians to travel between the West Bank and Gaza, and easing the closure of Israel's border with those areas.</p>
<p>Both sides agreed to resume talks on Hebron next week but they could bog down as Israel wants to change security arrangements in the city and the Palestinians do not.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be changes to certain elements,&quot; said Terje Larsen, the United Nations coordinator who helped engineer the summit. &quot;Israelis may request modifications on certain elements in the agreements but the Palestinians have to approve them, and they have strongly rejected any modifications,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Larsen seized on what many Israeli commentators saw as a sea change in the Israeli right-wing -- the split between the mainstream Likud and the far right Greater Israel camp, which believes in settling the West Bank and Gaza as part of Israel's God-given duty.</p>
<p>&quot;What is important is that the Likud have crossed the psychological barrier by meeting the enemy in a cordial manner and committing itself to a peace accord signed with the PLO, which it has recognised yesterday for the first time,&quot; Larsen said.</p>
<p>Jewish settlers regretted the Likud recognition of the PLO and vowed to continue building. &quot;This is a very sad day for the people of Israel, for the government and for us,&quot; Hebron settler Noam Arnon said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu faces opposition for his handshake from within Likud from ministers such as Benjamin Begin, son of late leader Menachem Begin, but is expected to weather the storm.</p>
<p>&quot;The parties are back at the table and the peace process is back on track,&quot; Larsen said. But he acknowledged the next phase, negotiating a final settlement of the 50-year-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict, will be difficult. &quot;A process has started with wide gaps between the two sides...There are suspicions and confidence is not entirely built.&quot;</p>
