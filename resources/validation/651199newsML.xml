<p>France's new Socialist-led government has raised the stakes in a poker game with Germany over a single currency in a drive to change the shape of EMU and meet a campaign pledge to end austerity in Europe.</p>
<p>At issue is something much bigger than its approval of an EU &quot;stability pact&quot; limiting budget deficits after the launch of economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;Two visions of Europe are confronting each other.</p>
<p>&quot;One founded on deregulation, the end of public services and austerity for the people is that of the right. The other, which we have always defended, is that of an independent Europe, directed towards progress, the improvement in living conditions and employment, affirmation of a social model, faithfulness to our civilisation.&quot;</p>
<p>These quotes are not taken from some careless talk on the hustings, but from the Socialist party manifesto which spells out in presumably well-thought out language what it would do if it won power in France.</p>
<p>On Monday, Finance Minister Dominque Strauss-Kahn served notice on his EU partners at a meeting in Luxembourg that the government planned to carry out its election promises.</p>
<p>France would not back the stability pact without talks to improve political co-ordination in EMU, placing growth and jobs on an equal footing with budget discipline and price control.</p>
<p>But France did not want to renegotiate the stability pact -- again faithful to the manifesto which skirts round the question and calls instead for a &quot;solidarity and growth pact&quot;.</p>
<p>Former European Commission President Jacques Delors, who has been advising the government, has suggested a protocol could be added to the pact outlining how euro zone countries would co-ordinate policies to create growth and jobs.</p>
<p>The big question is how far Prime Minister Lionel Jospin is ready to push his vision of Europe at the risk of alienating Germany, which fears any political interference in the future European Central Bank or weakening of the new euro.</p>
<p>The answer is probably, quite far.</p>
<p>&quot;It sounds as if Jospin can ask for quite a lot,&quot; ABN Amro economist Philippe Brossard said. &quot;He may be in a position to try a very hard bluff with the Germans.&quot;</p>
<p>Financial markets, far from punishing France's new tough line on Europe by marking down its currency and bonds against those in Germany, have barely dented the franc/mark rate or the spread between French government debt (OATS) and Bunds.</p>
<p>Germany itself is weakened by budgetary, political and economic problems.</p>
<p>And France has found an unlikely ally in Britain, where the new Labour government -- which heralded a shift to the left in Europe -- is also calling for more emphasis on jobs.</p>
<p>Both are trying to forge a leading role in Europe, and one senior official suggested they might be the two countries to watch as the EMU diplomatic dance unfolds with Germany.</p>
<p>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown was among the first to say France was quite right to ask for more time to study the stability pact and discuss it with parliament.</p>
<p>And Britain will be managing the decisions on who joins EMU when it takes over the EU's six-month presidency in January.</p>
<p>In the meantime, France's other EU partners are in retreat -- at least until and if EMU standard-bearer Germany fights back with a threat to delay EMU if Paris does not back down.</p>
<p>At Monday's meeting in Luxembourg, EU ministers who had scoffed at the previous centre-right government's attempts to impose a more political vision on EMU, were scrambling to catch up with Paris's new definition of political correctness.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have a centralised monetary policy, then I suppose there is a greater need for coordination of labour policy,&quot; Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said.</p>
<p>According to European Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy, a Frenchman, there had been &quot;a great breakthrough for jobs&quot;. Again, refer to the Socialist manifesto which accused the previous government of not standing up for France in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;For two years, France has not had a European policy. We are no longer listened to, because we have nothing to say,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It has not made itself heard, and likely to carry on doing so if Jospin, reputed for caution and stubborness, does what he has promised and refuses to renege on his campaign pledges.</p>
<p>Those manifesto pledges were for &quot;a political and not technocratic vision of Europe&quot;, flexible interpretation of the Maastricht treaty, early membership for Italy and Spain, a euro which is not overvalued -- and the solidarity and growth pact.</p>
