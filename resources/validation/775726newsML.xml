<p>The first nationwide strike at United Parcel Service disrupted package deliveries across the country on Monday but no new talks were scheduled to try to end the day-old work stoppage.</p>
<p>Striking drivers, package sorters and loaders began shutting down UPS facilities across the country just past midnight EDT, hours after negotiations on a new contract collapsed in a dispute over pay, benefits and job security.</p>
<p>It was the first national strike in the 90-year history of UPS, which delivers about 12 million packages daily, and where the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 185,000 workers.</p>
<p>With the union and UPS far apart on pay, pensions, job security and other issues, President Bill Clinton said he would not intervene in the dispute and advised negotiators to return to the bargaining table. No new talks were scheduled.</p>
<p>Ten strikers were arrested outside UPS facilities in Boston and Chicago for allegedly trying to block trucks from leaving. In California, two people were injured in incidents when trucks tried to cross picket lines to enter UPS plants.</p>
<p>The Teamsters represent about two-thirds of UPS workers who sort and load packages, haul shipments and drive the company's well-known brown vans. In 1994, a one-day walkout by some Teamster members cost the company about $50 million.</p>
<p>Only a few thousand Teamsters defied union bosses and crossed picket lines, the company said, while skeleton crews of managers and non-union employees struggled to keep the company's massive delivery system operating.</p>
<p>&quot;There are instances of entire centres, entire operations that are working as normal. But I won't kid you. The overwhelming number of UPS Teamster employees have chosen not to work,&quot; UPS spokesman Ken Sternad said.</p>
<p>The strike was expected to have little effect on UPS traffic between the United States, Europe and other overseas destinations.</p>
<p>But at home, businesses across the country searched for other ways to ship products and documents, and rivals such as the Postal Service and Federal Express Corp. scrambled to service stranded UPS customers.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, it's had a negative impact on us,&quot; said a worker at Roxter Manufacturing Corp., a lamp maker in New York City. &quot;We can't get our shipments out,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>UPS sought to demonstrate the strike's potential impact by saying the packages it normally delivers year-round were worth 6 percent of the nation's $8 trillion economy. UPS has annual sales of $22.4 billion and normally handles 80 percent of the packages delivered to offices, small businesses, hospitals and households in the United States.</p>
<p>But Clinton said the effects were not severe enough to cause him to intervene under federal law, which allows the president to step in when a labour dispute poses a threat to the nation.</p>
<p>&quot;At this time, I don't think any further action by me is appropriate,&quot; he said, noting he had sought intervention by a federal mediator whose efforts proved fruitless. &quot;UPS is a very important company to our country and there are a lot of employees there and I hope they'll go back to the table.&quot;</p>
<p>Chief UPS negotiator Dave Murray said he was disappointed but pledged to continue lobbying for renewed White House action. UPS, union and administration officials held talks later in the day.</p>
<p>But the two sides remained far apart over union demands for better health and pension benefits, higher pay and restrictions on part-time workers and non-union subcontractors.</p>
<p>&quot;I think working people have been taking it on the chin long enough,&quot; Teamsters President Ron Carey told CNN. &quot;It's a crime that they have forced our members into a strike.&quot;</p>
<p>Murray, who called the union &quot;highly irresponsible&quot; late on Sunday, said Monday that union leaders had walked away from an offer to raise pension benefits 50 percent.</p>
<p>Murray also labeled union claims of a shift to part-time workers at UPS as &quot;misinformation,&quot; saying growth in overseas and express services had created more new part-time jobs.</p>
<p>The remarks drew a sharp response from striking Teamsters, who pointed out that the company offers the same $8-an-hour starting wage that it did in the 1980s.</p>
<p>&quot;Our beef is that they have hundreds of part-time jobs running end to end, which could be combined into good-paying full-time jobs. The only way for part-time workers to move into full-time work has been through attrition,&quot; said Bob Mercer, a striking UPS van driver.</p>
<p>Union workers walked picket lines or prepared to picket outside about 1,700 UPS hub and shipping facilities and at airports where the company maintains air-delivery operations.</p>
<p>If the strike drags on, its effects could start to ripple throughout the economy, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We'd probably start seeing some manufacturing shutdowns&quot; if the strike lasts longer than a few days, said Michael Evans, an economist at Northwestern University's Kellogg School and a consultant for the American Production and Inventory Control Society.</p>
