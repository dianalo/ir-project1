<p>Time Warner Inc. said Wednesday it would go ahead with its planned merger with Turner Broadcasting System on Thursday without the approval of New York City cable regulators.</p>
<p>Separately, News Corp. Ltd. filed a lawsuit charging Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting with anti-trust violations.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court here, News Corp. Ltd. asked for $1 billion in punitive damages for alleged violations of antitrust laws and to compensate for damages it said its Fox News Channel suffered when Time Warner reneged on a promise to carry the new 24-hour channel on its cable television network.</p>
<p>In its suit, News Corp contends it had an agreement with Time Warner to carry the news programme. That agreement was reversed, it said, after Ted Turner urged Time Warner to back out of the deal.</p>
<p>Time Warner President Richard Parsons said through a spokesman, &quot;This lawsuit is utter foolishness.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokesman for Turner Broadcasting could not be reached immediately for comment.</p>
<p>New York City regulators said Time Warner, operator of seven New York City franchises with 1.2 million customers, must await their ruling on whether or not the merger constitutes a change of ownership at Time Warner.</p>
<p>Such a change of control could prompt an immediate rebidding of the franchises due to expire in 1998, city officials have said.</p>
<p>Time Warner has repeatedly said the Turner acquisition creating the world's biggest media company does not constitute a change of ownership and has been passed on by 90 percent of the local regulators overseeing its U.S. cable systems.</p>
<p>The dispute between the city government of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Time Warner arose after Time Warner refused to carry on its New York systems the Fox News Channel owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd.</p>
<p>Giuliani has backed News Corp.'s efforts to get on the New York systems and has proposed giving Fox space on city government cable channels. Time Warner opposes such a move.</p>
<p>The city's franchise review panel, composed largely of members appointed by Giuliani, had been scheduled to vote Wednesday on the issue but instead said it need required more time to determine whether or not Time Warner had undergone a change of control.</p>
<p>&quot;Prior to merging they need to get the approval of the city .... They scheduled the merger without getting the city's approval,&quot; said Craig Muraskin, an aide to Giuliani.</p>
<p>Richard Aurelio, head of Time Warner's New York City cable operations, said, &quot;We do not need the city's consent to go forward with the merger. We will be going ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>Marla Simpson, an aide to Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger, a Democrat expected to oppose Republican Giuliani in the next mayoral election, said that technically Time Warner was abandoning its New York City franchises.</p>
<p>&quot;The city is forcing Time Warner to run a very big gamble,&quot; Simpson said.</p>
<p>Simpson said the franchise panel had been notified in July about the Turner-Time Warner combination, allowing adequate time for review.</p>
