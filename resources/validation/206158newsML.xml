<p>Long dollar players, squeezed out of their positions by the Reserve Bank's one point interest rate hike, gave the rand a five cent boost on Thursday amid expectations the currency could firm further on Friday.</p>
<p>At the local close the rand was quoted at 4.6180/6230 against the dollar from 4.6650/6700 overnight.</p>
<p>Dealers said the prime reason for the currency's strength on the day was the impact the rate hike had on carry costs.</p>
<p>&quot;The Reserve Bank's interest rate hike makes the cost of carry more expensive, which makes holding long dollars and short rand a costly exercise,&quot; Banque Indosuez trader Rudy Jordaan said.</p>
<p>As a result players were forced to cut their positions, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone was squeezed out of their longs,&quot; another trader said. &quot;The market was awash with dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>As the currency firmed to below the 4.62 level, dealers said stop-losses were triggered, carrying the rand to a day's strongest level of 4.5950 bid.</p>
<p>&quot;It bounced off their quite nicely,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;We saw some importers and also the market was quite happy to take on some dollars at the 4.60 level which is a crucial chart point.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said there was talk that the Reserve Bank assisted the rand's move downwards, in what they said was a bid to trigger more stop losses.</p>
<p>Bertus van Zyl, general manager of the Reserve Bank's international banking division, had no comment on the rumours.</p>
<p>While dealers said that the rand was likely to test the 4.60 level again on Friday, one economist felt the positive effects of the rate hike on the currency would be temporary.</p>
<p>&quot;The point of the fact is that we already had high real interest rates before (Wednesday's rate hike) and if we couldn't attract capital with the ones that we had before what is one percent going to do?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said it could attract capital in the short-term because speculators would come in expecting to see bargains on bonds and equities. But in the longer term, the outlook for the rand remained bearish.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the day we are not seeing those long-term capital investments in the productive capacity of the country. If we don't see that the rand will still be vulnerable to speculative attacks,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The rand also firmed slightly against the crosses, firming to 7.7800/7930 against sterling from 7.8144/8274 on Wednesday and to 0.3247/3251 marks from 0.3210/3214 previously.</p>
<p>Bond also finished firmer after being pulled between offshore selling and local buying as sentiment was lifted by the rand's gains.</p>
<p>The key R150 settled at 15.945 percent from 15.965 percent on Wednesday after trading between a high of 16.15 percent and a low of 15.84 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said local demand was mainly institutional, with the bulk of trade seen between 16.10 and 16.15 percent and between 15.90 and 15.85 percent. Volumes on the day were described as heavy.</p>
<p>The money market was unfased by the interest rate hike, having already discounted a one point move, dealers said.</p>
<p>Banks quoted their three-month NCD rates unchanged at between 16.95 percent and 17.00 percent offered, while the 90-day BA rate was also unmoved at between 16.30 and 16.60 percent.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank indicated the daily shortage lower at 9.378 billion rand on Wednesday compared with 9.697 billion rand on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Bond Exchange said foreigners bought a net 211.98 million rand worth of South African bonds on Wednesday after selling 48.43 million rand worth on Tuesday. Nominal cumulative volumes were pegged at 5.9 billion rand on Wednesday from 3.73 billion rand on Tuesday.</p>
