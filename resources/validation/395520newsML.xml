<headline>Indonesian rupiah stable in dull late trading.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-02-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Indonesian rupiah was stable against the dollar in slow late trading on Friday after a lack of fresh leads in the market and amid ample liquidity, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said liquidity was ample but operators were reluctant to boost dollar holdings because of liquidity worries due to the approaching fiscal year-end on March 31.</p>
<p>One local bank dealer said operators restrained themselves from buying dollars because liquidity could turn tight quickly.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was at 2,388.25/88.50 at 0900 GMT against an opening of 2,388.25/89.00. Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,399.10/88.35 and 2,387.5/88.0, respectively.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's a one way market due to ample liquidity. Overall volume was thin,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>Overnight swaps were at 0.3/0.4 and tom/next at 0.15/0.20.</p>
<p>One-month swaps were at 10.60/11.25, two at 24.0/25.0, three at 38.25/38.75 and six at 76.00/77.00 points.</p>
<p>Bank Indonesia kept its intervention band at 2,380/2,572 and the conversion band at 2,380/2,428 on Friday.</p>
<p>The central bank depreciated the rupiah by two points this week after lowering it by three points last week.</p>
