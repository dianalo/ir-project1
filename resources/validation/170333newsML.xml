<headline>Some $40 mln in Maine bond issues pass.</headline>
<dateline>AUGUSTA, Maine 1996-11-06</dateline>

<p>Election officials said Maine voters approved a total of around $40 million of bond initiatives:</p>
<p>--$16.5 million to clean up public health, hazardous substance discharge sites, including tire stockpiles, with $9 million set aside for drinking water grants for cities and towns.</p>
<p>--$11 million to encourage job growth and economic vitality by helping agricultural enterprises and small businesses get capital.</p>
<p>--$10 million to clean up water pollution and drinking water problems.</p>
<p>--$3 million for capital improvements at state parks.</p>
<p>Other questions on the ballot including those calling for term limits and campaign finance reform also passed.</p>
<p>But there was no clear cut answer to the measures that proposed a ban on the clearcutting of forests in the nation's most heavily wooded state.</p>
<p>Maine voters defeated a proposal to ban forest clearcutting, but a less-restricting alternative did not get enough support to avoid facing another vote, according to media projections.</p>
<p>The proposed ban received 32 percent compared to 45 percent for an alternative referendum that would tighten restrictions on clearcutting not stop the practice, according to an exit polls by Maine Public Radio.</p>
<p>A third referendum measure that would keep the state's current logging rules received only 23 percent support according to the exit polls.</p>
<p>Under Maine's election law if none of the competing referendum receive more than 50 percent the leading measure is subjected to a second election. That election would be held in 1997, according to state officials.</p>
