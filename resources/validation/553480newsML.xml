<p>Hong Kong has taken the first step toward drafting a modern, streamlined Companies Ordinance, senior government officials and legal consultants said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are proposing a new model for the framework for the Companies Ordinance in Hong Kong...using international benchmarkets in companies law,&quot; said consultant Cally Jordon, former assistant professor at the Faculty of Law at McGill University, Montreal, at a news conference called to present the consultants' report.</p>
<p>The consultants in their Review of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance said they had adopted a core company law approach which moved away from the complicated British-style legislation toward a simple Commonwealth model.</p>
<p>The report recommended an unbundling of the non-core legislation included in the current Companies Ordinance, such as legislation on securities and bankruptcy.</p>
<p>&quot;If we take out the solvency law, it will reduce the Hong Kong company's law by one-third,&quot; said Jordan.</p>
<p>The review recommended the insolvency provisions of the companies ordinance and the bankruptcy ordinance be combined in a separate, comprehensive Insolvency Ordinance.</p>
<p>The report also recommended a single regime for both public and private companies, one which focuses on providing a simple, efficient and cost effective method of incorporation and ongoing corporate maintenance.</p>
<p>The recommendations also provide a framework for a new law which was more applicable to Hong Kong, where nearly 99 percent of incorporations are private companies, the report said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's current ordinance was originally drafted with 19th century public companies in mind, the report said.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of a Companies Ordinance in Hong Kong should be &quot;to be enabling and permissive rather than regulating and prohibitive and to refrain from being a vehicle for implementation of industrial relations, tax, social or monetary policy,&quot; the consultants' report said.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that our recommendations are consistent with the Hong Kong government's noninterventionist, free market economy,&quot; said Ermanno Pascutto, former deputy chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission, who led the study.</p>
<p>In common law countries, the companies law had a profit-making focus and this was still the case in the Hong Kong recommendations, the consultants said.</p>
<p>The consultants' review took slightly more than two years to complete.</p>
<p>The Standing Committee on Company Law Reform, a non-statutory body which advises the Financial Secretary, would begin a 12-month examination of the consultants' report on May 3, said G.W. Jones, registrar of companies.</p>
<p>A public consultation period will be held simultaneously with the standing committee's review.</p>
<p>The consultants said the entire process of drafting and enacting a new companies law would take five to seven years.</p>
