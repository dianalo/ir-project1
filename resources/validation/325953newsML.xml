<headline>U.S. shuttle heads for landing.</headline>
<dateline>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. 1997-01-22</dateline>

<p>After 128 days aloft, astronaut John Blaha headed home on Wednesday aboard the space shuttle Atlantis.</p>
<p>Flying tail-first over the Indian Ocean, the shuttle fired its braking rockets at 8:17 a.m. EST (1317 GMT) to begin a fiery hour-long plunge through the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The $2 billion spaceship was scheduled to touch down at the Kennedy Space Centre under partly cloudy skies at around 9:23 a.m. EST (1423 GMT).</p>
<p>Overcast conditions at the Florida spaceport had delayed the shuttle's return to earth by 90 minutes, but the clouds began to break up in time for the shuttle's second and last landing opportunity on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Atlantis was bringing home John Blaha, who spent four months living and working aboard Russia's Mir space station.</p>
<p>The 54-year-old astronaut was to ride back to Earth in a reclining chair, his body wired with sensors so doctors could monitor his health as he felt the pull of gravity for the first time in 128 days.</p>
<p>Atlantis docked with Mir last week to collect Blaha and drop off his replacement, Jerry Linenger. The shuttle also delivered more than three tons of supplies and equipment to the 11-year-old space station.</p>
