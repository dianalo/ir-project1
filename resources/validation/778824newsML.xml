<p>SIMEX Euroyen futures were stuck in a two-tick band on Tuesday but remained well supported as players lacked the conviction to push the market higher after Japanese government bond (JGB) futures ran into resistance.</p>
<p>Dealers said a report by the Japanese Economic Planning Agency (EPA) suggesting continued weakness in housing construction and poor consumption data helped underpin the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The EPA report showed the economy as still being weak so that provided good support for Euroyen futures,&quot; a trader at a U.S. investment house said.  </p>
<p>He said the lead March Euroyen contract should consolidate in a 99.16-99.23 range for the time being. At 1110 GMT, it was unchanged against its IMM close of 99.17.</p>
<p>Dealers said JGB futures came off their highs as Tokyo stocks recouped some of their losses before the close. The lead September contract ended at 126.41 against a previous 126.53 after hitting a high of 126.79.</p>
<p>Eurodollar futures dipped in thin trade as players continued to adjust their positions after the release of bullish U.S. data last Friday.  </p>
<p>Dealers said an unexpected rise in non-farm payrolls for July and in the National Association of Purchasing Management's indices of industry activity had brought the possibility of a U.S. rate hike back on the horizon.</p>
<p>December Eurodollars ended unchanged against an IMM close at 94.095 on volume of 3,755 lots.</p>
