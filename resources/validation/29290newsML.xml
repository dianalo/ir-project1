<p>Ukraine's request for a $1.5 billion currency stabilisation fund from the International Monetary Fund to back its new hryvnya currency is still under discussion, an IMF official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The hryvnya itself, introduced on Monday, was steady and bankers said it showed no immediate signs of weakening.</p>
<p>&quot;The discussions are continuing,&quot; said resident representative Alex Sundakov. &quot;It's hard to comment on any timetable.&quot;</p>
<p>The hryvnya replaces the interim karbovanets currency, introduced after independence in 1991, which will be taken out of circulation by September 16.</p>
<p>Sundakov would not comment on Ukraine's decision to launch the new currency, which at 100,000 karbovanets to one hryvnya, wipes five zeroes off prices.</p>
<p>But he said an IMF mission, which visits Ukraine regularly to review its economic performance under an $867 million loan agreement, will return to Kiev on September 16.</p>
<p>Ukrainian government and central bank officials say they are confident they will receive the stabilisation fund, but the issue was not settled when the last mission left Kiev in August.</p>
<p>The hryvnya was unchanged at 1.76 to the dollar on the Ukraine Interbank Currency Exchange on Tuesday. Bankers and economists said this stability was to be expected.</p>
<p>&quot;Many banks are not selling dollars for the hryvnya right now. They're waiting to see what the National Bank will do,&quot; said Ihor Davydenko of Ukrinbank.</p>
<p>He said the hryvnya was holding its own without central bank support. &quot;That's keeping people calm,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Dmytro Kozmaty of Pravexbank said the central bank, whose $2.1 billion in reserves equals the amount of money circulating in Ukraine, was intervening to keep the hryvnya stable.</p>
<p>&quot;They will probably keep doing that for two weeks, so that people don't panic,&quot; Kozmaty said.</p>
<p>Both bankers did not expect dollar demand to rise in the near future and predicted the hryvnya would remain at present levels or even rise slightly after mid-month when the karbovanets is removed from circulation.</p>
<p>&quot;This change is denominational and there have been no changes in exchange rate policy, so it's normal that it's staying at the same level,&quot; said Rafal Antczak of the Harvard Institute for International Development.</p>
<p>The karbovanets had remained at about 176,000 to the dollar in the months running up to the hryvnya's introduction.</p>
<p>&quot;Maintaining the level is a question of credibility, and it is a signal for enterprises, for exporters and importers,&quot; Antczak said.</p>
<p>Bankers said the shift to the new currency was not disrupting their work.</p>
<p>But the Ukrainian Stock Exchange, where share transactions reached into billions and trillions in the old currency, suspended its weekly trading session on Tuesday in order to revamp its accounting system.</p>
<p>&quot;We have put off today's trading purely for technical reasons. We need to change the prices of shares and the starting capital of enterprises being privatised into hryvnya,&quot; said Viktoria Myasnykova, head of the exchange's accounting division.</p>
