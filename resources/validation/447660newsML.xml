<p>Sri Lanka has called for proposals from brokerages on ways of drastically cutting its balance holding in the six privatised plantation firms, an official from the Public Enterprise Reform Commission (PERC) said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have asked brokers for porposals on how best to reduce the balance government holding to one share from 3.8 million shares (in each firm),&quot; said the official from PERC, which oversees privatisations.  </p>
<p>The government will retain one 'golden share' in each of the six privatised plantation firms now trading in Colombo, which will enable it to intervene in the event of malpractices, the official, who declined to be named, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The government privatised Kegalle Plantations Ltd, Kelani Valley Plantations ltd, Agalawatte Plantations Ltd, Horana Plantations Ltd, Bogawantalawa Plantations Ltd and Kotagala Plantations Ltd in 1995 and 1996 by selling 51 percent to a strategic investor and 20 percent to the public</p>
<p>Ten percent was reserved for estate workers while the government retained 19 percent or 3.8 million shares in each of the firms.  </p>
<p>Sri Lanka's plantation firms, once the mainstay of the island's economy, are in the limelight once again as they have started making profits after privatisation, analysts said.</p>
<p>The once debt-riddled sector is poised for recovery due to investments which are taking place in replanting, fertiliser, machinery and value additions, said one analyst.</p>
<p>When the government began privatising management in 1992, which later spread to ownership, most of the 23 regional plantation firms which own some 600,000 hectares of tea, rubber and coconut plantations had each run up debts ranging between five million rupees to 100 million rupees. ($1=57.7 rupees)</p>
