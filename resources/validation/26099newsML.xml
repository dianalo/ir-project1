<p>Captured Mafia boss Giovanni Brusca has told magistrates that Sicily's Cosa Nostra is in crisis and has been leaderless since &quot;boss of bosses&quot; Salvatore &quot;Toto&quot; Riina was arrested in 1993, a newspaper said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Since Toto Riina ended up in jail, Cosa Nostra has been without a real leader...at the moment, it has no charismatic figure at its head,&quot; La Repubblica quoted Brusca as saying.</p>
<p>Brusca, one of Sicily's most feared Mafia godfathers before his arrest in May, suddenly decided to turn state's evidence a week ago and has promised to reveal all.</p>
<p>Magistrates are treating his evidence with caution and have not yet admitted him to Italy's witness protection programme.</p>
<p>La Repubblica said Brusca had confessed that the Mob knew it was in trouble.</p>
<p>&quot;The Mafia is going through a critical time,&quot; it quoted him as saying. &quot;The bosses don't consider themselves done for but they know that times have changed and the state is taking them on in earnest.&quot;</p>
<p>Italy has gone on the offensive since capturing Riina, who had been a fugitive for more than 23 years. Respected anti-Mafia expert Pino Arlacchi, a leftist deputy, said Italy should now seize a historic opportunity to beat the Mob.</p>
<p>&quot;Riina's Mafia is on the ropes. A good part of the current Mafia leadership could follow Brusca's example,&quot; he wrote in Saturday's edition of the Corriere della Sera newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a unique opportunity ahead of us. For the first time in the history of republican Italy, we're are in the position of turning a temporary defeat into a historic debacle for the Mafia.&quot;</p>
<p>But he cautioned: &quot;We've still got a long way to go and we face unforseen difficulties.&quot;</p>
<p>As if to prove him right, the Mafia was flexing its muscles in Sicily. Gunmen shot dead Giuseppe Giovanni Caffri, a mobster seen as loyal to Brusca, near Palermo on Friday night in what investigators believed was a vendetta and warning to turncoats.</p>
<p>Caffri was related by marriage to Francesco Di Carlo, a Mafia boss accused by some prominent turncoats of killing the head of crashed Banco Ambrosiano in 1982 and who was reported to have recently begun collaborating with investigators.</p>
<p>Roberto Calvi, the bank's chairman, was found hanged under Blackfriars bridge over the river Thames in central London several weeks before his bank went under but the circumstances of his death remain murky.</p>
<p>Brusca, publicly branded &quot;a beast&quot; by another turncoat whose 12-year-old son he was alleged to have strangled and disposed of in a vat of acid, has been charged with several Mafia attacks.</p>
<p>But La Repubblica said he was fed up with being blamed for crimes he did not commit. &quot;I don't like it when people say Brusca this, Brusca that, Brusca did everything. I want to defend myself from monstrous things,&quot; it quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Investigators believe Brusca pushed the button detonating a bomb under anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone's motrocade near Palermo in 1992, killing Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards.</p>
<p>Brusca is also accused of helping plan 1993 Mafia bombings against cultural monuments in Rome, Florence and Milan. La Repubblica quoted him as saying Riina's brother-in-law Leoluca Bagarella was behind the strategy and that he always believed &quot;it would severely damage our organisation, which it has done&quot;.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano is due to give a report on turncoats to parliament next week amid debate over the merits of a witness protection system that some feel is flawed.</p>
<p>A Mafia turncoat was detained on Thursday after allegedly ordered killings while on the protection programme, which offers ex-mobsters reduced sentences, a salary and a new identity.</p>
