<title>USA: OPTIONS - FX volatility curves flatten after G7.</title>
<headline>OPTIONS - FX volatility curves flatten after G7.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-02-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Volatility curves for dollar options, which have been inverted for some time, flattened sharply due to a deflation in the shorter maturities after the weekend Group of Seven (G7) meeting, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was obviously some air in the front end from fear of what unexpected lay on the other side (of G7),&quot; said Alan Revercomb, options strategist at I.D.E.A. Inc.</p>
<p>Implied volatility for one-month dollar/yen dipped to 10.9/11.2 percent by U.S. midsession, down some two percentage points from Friday, when the dollar gyrated wildly in nervous pre-G7 trading and bolstered short-dated volatilities.  </p>
<p>Six-month and one-year dollar/yen volatilities were at around 10.7/10.9 percent, half a point below Friday's levels.</p>
<p>One-month dollar/mark lost about 1.8 points at 9.3/9.6 percent, while one-year was off 0.7 point at 9.2/9.4.</p>
<p>&quot;We're probably going through a period of consolidation while the market digests everything that's happened in the first month of this year,&quot; Revercomb said. &quot;But further out the curve, it would take a long time to remove the effect of volatility that's already occurred.&quot;</p>
<p>The G7 said after their weekend meeting that misalignments in exchange markets of April 1995 had now been corrected.  </p>
<p>Although the G7 remarks pushed the dollar to lows of 121.10 yen and 1.64 marks in Monday's early Asian trading, the greenback has since recovered to about 123.00 yen and 1.6570 marks. Traders said the rebound convinced them that the greenback would likely resume its uptrend after a brief rest.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we're just in a consolidation phase now,&quot; said a trader at a U.S. bank in New York. &quot;You now have a well-defined downside in last night's lows, especially dollar/yen.&quot;</p>
<p>As the dollar edges up to new highs, it will keep propping up the shorter maturities, he noted.  </p>
<p>Still, in the very near term, bids were thin in the front end due in part to an upcoming three-day weekend in U.S. markets. Financial markets will be closed next Monday for the Presidents' Day holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;It definitely does make things more difficult here,&quot; Revercomb said. &quot;For most of the year, it's certainly been a one-way game to buy options -- go long gamma, vega and basically delta -- and it's been pretty hard to get hurt even if you had to pay expensive premiums. We're still in a more volatile environment, but now you have to be more precise in your timing.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;There's going to be a feeling that it's maybe better to shift some things further out the curve, looking for a movement down the road,&quot; he added. &quot;That's going to tend to give the curve a more positive slope.&quot;</p>
<p>Risk reversals, which reflect pricing differential for puts and calls, narrowed their skew towards dollar calls. One-month 25-delta for dollar/yen was at 0.2/0.5 percent in favor of yen puts, down from about 1.0 percent on Friday. One-month 25-delta for dollar/mark stood at 0.2/0.5 percent skewed for mark puts against about 0.3/0.6 percent.</p>
