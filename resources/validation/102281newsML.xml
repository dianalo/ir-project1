<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine bonds surge on strong mood, reform.</title>

<p>Argentine bonds surged Tuesday on strong demand for local paper after health care reform and traders predicted the mood would continue.</p>
<p>&quot;The tendency will continue, it's very strong,&quot; said a trader at an Argentine bank. Atypically though, local paper steamrolled ahead in above average volume while Argentine Brady debt declined slightly.</p>
<p>The dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $0.45 to 119.60, and Argentina's FRB due 2005 fell 1/8 to 84-5/8.</p>
<p>&quot;Above all peso bonds rose,&quot; said another trader, as local investors continued to venture out into higher-yielding peso-denominated bonds that generally start benefitting once a rally has been entrenched for several days.</p>
<p>The peso-denominated Bocon Previsional 1 due 2001 surged one peso to 113.00.</p>
<p>The first trader said the market was helped by the introduction of what he calls &quot;an important health care reform,&quot; and rising industrial production. President Carlos Menem introduced by decree late Monday a law giving people the right to choose their union-sponsored health scheme from the beginning of next year.</p>
<p>By early 1998, the government plans to allow workers to chose from between private health care schemes and union ones. That should mean savings as wage earners now have to pay contributions to union plans, which often do not function very well, and to private schemes as well to complement coverage.</p>
<p>Traders said bullish moods in other Latin American markets also helped Argentine bonds.</p>
<p>Call money rates fell to 6.36 percent from 6.77 percent.</p>
