<p>Hundreds of pro-democracy advocates held an &quot;alternative handover&quot; ceremony on Monday to mark the British colony's return to Communist China and called for human rights, democracy and freedom.</p>
<p>&quot;Give me back democracy. Give me freedom.&quot; said one of the placards strung between two poles in central Statue Square.</p>
<p>Britain hands back Hong Kong to China at midnight on Monday, ending 156 years of British rule. Many residents are concerned over a possible dilution of recent democratic reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel the official handover celebrations don't reflect Hong Kong people's feeling. Therefore we are holding an alternative handover programme for Hong Kong people to express their views freely,&quot; Rose Wu, spokeswoman for the organisers, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Whichever government rules Hong Kong, the most important thing is that sovereignty belongs to the people. Therefore citizens should have direct participation in Hong Kong's future political system, human rights and economic policy,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Pro-democracy campaigners erected a &quot;democracy wall&quot; in the &quot;alternative handover&quot; area for people to post up their views on democracy.</p>
<p>&quot;Power is not in-born. It is given. It is given by people,&quot; said one note. &quot;Society needs improvement, and there should be freedom of speech.&quot;</p>
<p>Lau Chin-shek, spokesman from the group that set up the &quot;democracy wall&quot;, pledged to continue their quest to maintain Hong Kong's freedoms after the handover.</p>
<p>&quot;We are here to express our determination to continue to fight for democracy and freedom,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lau said he would continue to campaign for democratic rights after the handover, even if it meant he risked arrest -- a sentiment echoed by another outspoken democracy activist, Szeto Wah, whom Beijing has branded a subversive.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome the handover with the spirit of welcoming challenges,&quot; Szeto said.</p>
<p>He vowed to stay in Hong Kong to carry on his pro-democracy campaign. He said the movement faced many difficulties, &quot;but our aim will eventually be achieved&quot;.</p>
<p>Szeto was one of a dozen demonstrators who staged a sit-in outside the legislature building on Monday to protest against the dissolution of the elected legislature after the handover and its replacement by a pro-Beijing assembly.</p>
<p>&quot;Elected legislators' voices can't be stifled,&quot; they chanted. &quot;The provisional legislature is shameful.&quot;</p>
