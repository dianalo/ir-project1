<p>Self-proclaimed President Laurent Kabila has cracked down on political opposition in the Democratic Republic of Congo, extending a ban on political activities and public demonstrations to the capital Kinshasa.</p>
<p>But opposition militants said that they planned to go ahead with a march in the capital planned for Wednesday, with one spokesman likening the style of the new leadership in the former Zaire to that of ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>State television, meanwhile, reported that international flights to the capital would resume on Tuesday with a flight by Belgian carrier Sabena but said that the river crossing to neighbouring Congo would stay closed until further notice.</p>
<p>State television announced the Kinshasa ban in a communique read on news bulletins, citing a need to protect public safety and property. The ban is until further notice.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't banned the parties, they exist but they cannot carry out any activities,&quot; information ministry spokesman Leyka Moussa Nyembo told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The parties stop being active until we have restored a bit of order,&quot; he said, describing the ban as nationwide.</p>
<p>Information Minister Raphael Ghenda told reporters the country was going through a difficult period and that political activities could currently cause things to get out of control.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a time for everything and we are in a period during we we are setting up a government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Aides and allies of veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi said that Wednesday's planned march would go ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the kind of thing we are used to from the Mobutu period. These are neo-Mobutists who want to prevent our activity. We will ignore them totally,&quot; said Vianney Kabukanye, secretary general of the youth wing of Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS).</p>
<p>Joseph Olenghakoy, a Tshisekedi ally, said the march would &quot;show the people's attachment to Kabila&quot; but also its wishes.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi aide Laurent Mbayo confirmed the march would go ahead. &quot;It's a march organised by the party,&quot; he said, but he distanced himself from Olenghakoy's views on the march.</p>
<p>Earlier, Kabila's justice minister, Celestin Louangy, said the law in the new Congo would be administered impartially. &quot;We want to restore the confidence of the people. Everyone should feel protected,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Opposition activists marched in Kinshasa on Friday and Saturday. Kabila forces fired in the air and took away some protesters. Government officials said they were later released.</p>
<p>Kabila's ministers accuse Tshisekedi of deluding the people to feed his own ambition.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi aides say Kabila has flooded the capital with troops from Rwanda and other neighbours and accuse him of seeking to return to a one-party state. They say foreign troops must leave and call for political dialogue.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi, citing a 1992 vote in a sovereign national conference in what was then Zaire, has doggedly insisted over the years that constitutionally he is prime minister.</p>
<p>Kabila aides say there will be no post of prime minister in the new administration but that Kabila plans to name new ministers to increase the size of his government from 13 to 20.</p>
<p>His Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo marched into Kinshasa on May 17. They took up arms in October after the denial of Zairean nationality for ethnic Tutsis.</p>
<p>Kabila has said elections, a key demand of the U.N. and many Western nations, will have to wait for two years.</p>
