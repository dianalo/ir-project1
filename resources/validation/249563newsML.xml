<title>USA: U.S. Mint offered bargain premiums for nickel.</title>
<headline>U.S. Mint offered bargain premiums for nickel.</headline>

<p>The torpid year-end spot market for nickel was reflected in Tuesday's Mint tender, though traders insisted that elsewhere in the market they could still improve on the bargain premiums the government was offered.</p>
<p>Traders said Hochschild Partners and Phoenix International Resources appeared set to sell the lion's share of the 186 tonnes of 4x4 cut melting grade nickel cathode or briquettes sought by the Mint.</p>
<p>Tender premiums over LME cash were about 7.8 to 8.8 cents per pound, with delivery and 30-days payment terms included. The Mint was due to officially announce the tender outcome probably later today.</p>
<p>But traders said the overall spot market premiums were still in the 8 to 12 cents per pound range or even a touch higher, with the upper end for less than truckload quantities. &quot;It's just if you are buying significant tonnages, you get a very cheap price,&quot; a merchant said. But one trader who bid to sell material noted the Mint &quot;were pretty reliable payers, so you are not taking much of a risk there.&quot;</p>
<p>Another trader added,&quot;These seem to be very aggressive premiums - but they only seem to be available to the Mint.&quot; Generally the spot nickel market has been quiet and was expected to remain so until next year.</p>
<p>&quot;People have really done a lot of their contracting for next year. The prices on the LME are very attractive, so many consumers are pricing their metal for next year,&quot; a Canadian dealer said.</p>
<p>Other traders said that melting grade premiums have to be offered at about 8 cents per pound to get any volume business. Slack demand for melting grade nickel from the stainless steel mills - its biggest consumer - left metal looking for a home, though premiums on the more expensive plating grade were holding well at about 20 cents per pound, traders said.</p>
