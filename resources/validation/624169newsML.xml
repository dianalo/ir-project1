<title>UK: LME aluminium dips, tin at six-week low.</title>
<headline>LME aluminium dips, tin at six-week low.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>LME aluminium gave back the previous day's gains on Thursday morning, deepening its recent losses, while copper edged off its highs.</p>
<p>Most other metals were softer, with tin crumbling to its lowest level in six weeks.</p>
<p>Three months copper skated up to $2,537 on the pre-market, helped by a hefty 3,550 tonne stocks draw, but wandered back down to end the morning kerb $2 lower at $2,529.</p>
<p>Some traders have been perplexed that the market has failed to correct since a bull run started nearly a month ago.</p>
<p>&quot;People keep going short, but there's no follow-through. I think we're going to have to wait until next week, the start of a new month, before we see some genuine selling come in,&quot;</p>
<p>But others said that copper was likely to maintain higher levels in the short-term despite its overbought situation due to supply problem.</p>
<p>The 14-day RSI -- at 76 on Thursday -- has remained for two weeks above 70, the point regarded by chartists as overbought.</p>
<p>&quot;It is tight, genuinely tight. I'm surprised the spreads didn't do more today,&quot; a floor trader said.</p>
<p>The premium of cash over three months metal ended the morning kerb slightly narrower at $70/$75. Most of the steam is in the July/August spread, which was at a $45 backwardation. In contrast, the nearby dates were calm, with the cash/June spread trading at a $3 contango.</p>
<p>Stocks should continue to fall over the next several weeks, and may well approach the 100,000 mark by the June date, a trader said. But come July, they may start rising as summer kicks in.</p>
<p>Total LME copper stocks were down to 133,025 tonnes on Thursday.</p>
<p>Aluminium gave up Wednesday's gains, continuing its downtrend since hitting $1,679 on May 12.</p>
<p>Since the market only popped up on Wednesday on the back of copper, it was vulnerable to any slippage, analysts said.</p>
<p>The market dipped to $1,624, where it found support from the 100-day moving average, finishing the kerb $18 weaker at $1,627.</p>
<p>The next key support level was pegged at $1,610, last Friday's low.</p>
<p>Tin slipped to the lowest level in about six weeks after stocks rose by 400 tonnes. Prices equallled the April 11 low of $5,600 and finished the morning there, a loss of $65.</p>
<p>Last week's failed upside break and rising stocks have cast a bearish pall over the market, analysts said. Last week stocks rose by 380 tonnes.</p>
<p>Nickel held in a narrow range after the recent declines, finding a floor at $7,270 support.</p>
<p>The market was keenly eyeing Inco labour talks ahead of the Sudbury labour contract expiry on May 31, and the outcome may give the market further direction.</p>
<p>Light support was pegged at $7,270, with an important area at the $7,110 low of April 14.</p>
<p>Zinc and lead were rangebound, shedding $3 to $1,357 and $4 to $637 respectively. Alloy dipped $10 to $1,495/500.</p>
