<p>Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek's centre-left Liberal Democrats looked set to return to power after winning most votes in a general election.</p>
<p>With most results of Sunday's general election counted, Drnovsek said he expected to be invited by President Milan Kucan to form the next government.</p>
<p>&quot;The Liberal Democrats are the strongest party. It is normal and expected that it should get the mandate to form the next government,&quot; a smiling Drnovsek told Slovenian television.</p>
<p>With over 95 percent of the vote counted, the National Electoral Commission said the Liberal Democrats had won 27.1 percent, three percent more than in the last election in 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;These are the best results of any single party in any election in Slovenia so far. In the current electoral system, it is not possible to get more,&quot; Drnovsek said.</p>
<p>The Liberal Democrats had faced a loose alliance of rightist parties, called the &quot;Slovenian Spring&quot;, which included the conservative People's Party, the centre-right Social Democrats and Christian Democrats.</p>
<p>The People's Party won 19.59 percent, a big 10-point jump on the 1992 results, with the Social Democrats in third place with 16.03 percent, the commission said.</p>
<p>The Christian Democrats took 9.52 percent, with the United List of Social Democrats, the former communists, on 9.02.</p>
<p>DeSUS, a party representing pensioners, look set to enter parliament for the first time with 4.29 percent and nationalists could just slip through on 3.22.</p>
<p>Two seats in parliament are reserved for the Hungarian and Italian ethnic communities.</p>
<p>The next few weeks are set to be dominated by political horse-trading to form the next government.</p>
<p>People's Party leader Marjan Podobnik, 36, said a coalition of the &quot;Slovenian Spring&quot; alliance was his party's priority, though he has not ruled out a partnership with Drnovsek.</p>
<p>But Podobnik has cautioned against rushing to join the European Union without securing a long transition period and protection for farmers, who mostly back his party.</p>
<p>A visibly downcast Social Democrat leader Janez Jansa said the alliance had been damaged by failing to make clear to voters that the parties were committed to working together.</p>
<p>The vote was the second election for the 90-seat parliament since Slovenia declared independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991. Turnout, at around 71 percent, was estimated to be down on the 85 percent recorded in the last election.</p>
<p>Political analysts have said Drnovsek's new government was likely to be more rightwing in character, and that he may ask the People's Party to join his government.</p>
<p>Drnovsek, president of the former Yugoslav Federation from 1989 to 1990, has warned that public spending must be cut and welfare payments reduced for Slovenia to have any chance of joining the EU by 2001 and qualifying for European economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>Slovenia's so-far sluggish privatisation process was also expected to be accelerated during the next term of government.</p>
<p>Slovenia, the most northern and homogenous of the former Yugoslav republics, has made strides under Drnovsek's rule to secure a stable democracy and one of the most thriving economies among Europe's ex-communist states.</p>
<p>The Alpine republic, bordered by Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia, is also among contenders to be included in the first expansion eastwards of the NATO military alliance.</p>
