<headline>Britannia Building Society lauds UK bonus scheme.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britannia Building Society said on Sunday that its loyalty bonus scheme for members is proving popular and helping it to maintain its market share.</p>
<p>An independent survey by City Research Associate into the scheme showed 42 percent of members interviewed said their loyalty to Britannia had increased because of the scheme whilst 32 percent said it would be their first choice for additional products because of it.</p>
<p>Eight-one percent of mortgage customers were pleased with the bonus payment compared with 73 percent of savers.</p>
<p>&quot;It has clearly inspired loyalty at a time when conversions seem to be the norm,&quot; Gerald Gregory Britannia's head of mutuality and marketing said in a press release.</p>
<p>While many other building societies have abandoned their mutual status and given huge payouts to members on flotation, Britannia remains fiercely committed to mutuality, launching its annual loyalty bonus scheme in February 1996.</p>
<p>In February this year, it made its first payout, distributing a total of 35 million stg -- a third of its profits -- with payments averaging 35 stg.</p>
<p>At the time of the research during early March to the middle of May, 20 percent had already spent or intended to spend their bonus payment while of those who had not spent it, 68 percent expected to invest it with Britannia.</p>
