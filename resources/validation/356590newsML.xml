<p>Ontario's economy will experience strong growth in the next two years despite government cutbacks, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce economists said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The improvements in the private sector should now have enough momentum to offset these changes and take growth to an accelerated level of 3.1 per cent in 1997 and 2.3 per cent in 1998,&quot; said CIBC economist Linda Nazareth in a statement.</p>
<p>The bank also said that Canada's most populous province was on track to better its deficit targets, but did not specify by how much.  </p>
<p>&quot;By effectively cutting provincial expenditures, Ontario has all but ensured that it will better its medium-term fiscal targets,&quot; Nazareth said.</p>
<p>Strength in the auto, electronic goods and high technology sectors were expected to help power growth in the province, CIBC said. Construction was also expected to be a bright spot as low interest rates boosted home sales. Ontario should therefore achieve the highest growth of any province except Alberta over the next two years, the bank said.  </p>
<p>CIBC said the employment outlook for the province was less positive, with a planned shifting of responsibilities between the province and its municipalities expected to result in further public sector jobs cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;Even so, growth in the private sector should cause employment to rise by two per cent in 1997 and a further 2.4 per cent in 1998, causing the unemployment rate to decline from its 1996 level of 9.1 per cent to 8.1 per cent by 1998,&quot; said Nazareth.</p>
