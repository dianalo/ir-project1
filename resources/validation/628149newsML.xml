<p>Asian coffee producers are scrambling to cash-in on the highest world coffee prices in two decades, but many may have missed the boat as global coffee stocks slump and prices on store shelves in the region climb.</p>
<p>&quot;It's so volatile at the moment, everyone is just standing around with their mouths open,&quot; one major coffee roaster said on Friday.  </p>
<p>New York arabica coffee futures set new 20-year peaks overnight on Thursday in the third straight day of a sizzling rally that saw prices shatter the $3.00 a pound barrier and the July contract settle six percent up on the day at 314.18 cents.</p>
<p>Consuming and producing countries' depleted coffee stocks, also hovering near 20-year lows, have been behind the sustained five-month run-up in futures. Since the start of the year, the New York market has soared more than 175 percent.</p>
<p>The latest fear among traders is that as cold weather sets in during the Brazilian winter next month, coffee trees could be damaged as they were during a hard frost in June 1994.  </p>
<p>Arabica coffee beans, growing predominantly in Central and South America, are milder in flavour and are generally regarded as of better quality than robusta beans which form the bulk of the coffee crops in Asia's big growers, Indonesia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Robusta beans are not in such short supply worldwide as their arabica counterparts and prices have lagged behind, though the main London robusta futures market still rallied to a 20-month high on Thursday.</p>
<p>Instant coffee manufacturers use a blend of arabica and robusta coffees to achieve the required taste and are increasing the proportion of robusta as arabica supplies dwindle.  </p>
<p>In Indonesia, the world's third largest coffee producer and the biggest grower of robusta, the main Grade 40 coffee for export has risen to around $2,300 a tonne FOB (free on board) compared with about $1,400 at the end of April.</p>
<p>&quot;The Indonesians are going to make some money out of this,&quot; a veteran coffee trader in Singapore said.</p>
<p>&quot;The farmers will reap a lot of money this year, but the crop is also down. I know of some farmers whose harvest will be 50 percent lower than what they had last year. That sort of evens out,&quot; another trader for a European dealing house said.  </p>
<p>One dealer said the Indonesian exporters who would benefit were those fixing their prices for nearby months in their contracts over the next few days. But those who pre-sold their crop before the recent rally erupted will lose out.</p>
<p>Traders estimate that between 60-80 percent of the Indonesian crop has already been harvested. The total exportable crop for this year will probably reach 240,000-260,000 tonnes, down sharply from the more than 300,000 tonnes last year.  </p>
<p>Exporters in Vietnam, hoping for even higher prices, are believed to be holding back about 25,000 tonnes of robusta beans, which is all the stock estimated to be left from 260,000 tonnes at the end of the crop in February.</p>
<p>In is much the same story in Thailand and India, two smaller Asian coffee growers.</p>
<p>Thai exporters are now thought to be holding only 2,000 tonnes of coffee and sellers are ignoring escalating bids from buyers amid fears that some suppliers may default on contracts.</p>
<p>India has already committed most of its coffee exports, estimated at 140,000 tonnes in the current season.  </p>
<p>Around the region retail coffee prices are on the rise and industry sources said this will ultimately hit consumption, bringing the market back into balance.</p>
<p>In Japan, the world's third largest coffee consumer after the U.S. and Germany, major roasters raised wholesale coffee prices by 20 percent this month, but the country has been importing more and stocks now stand at more than 20 percent above last year's levels.</p>
<p>New Zealand's coffee wholesalers have recently increased prices between 15-20 percent and importers expect retail prices will have to go up by 50 percent.  </p>
<p>One importer said if frost did hit the Brazilian coffee growing season, then the price could jump to three times today's levels. Each 10 percent price rise saw coffee consumption fall 1-2 percent, he said.</p>
