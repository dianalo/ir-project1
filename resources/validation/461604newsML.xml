<p>Japan's third largest political party ended months of wavering on Saturday with a declaration that it would not join hands with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
<p>&quot;It is impossible to form a government with the present Hashimoto LDP administration,&quot; Democratic Party leader Naoto Kan said at a party convention in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The decision could hamper Hashimoto's efforts to secure land for U.S. bases on the southern island of Okinawa, where about 3,000 owners of land covering 362,000 square metres (433,000 sq yards) on 12 bases are refusing to renew leases when they expire on May 15.</p>
<p>Hashimoto, who this month indicated he is considering emergency legislation to expropriate the land, has been seeking allies in case that measure alienates the loose alliance of parties which allows his minority government to rule.</p>
<p>Since elections last October, the LDP has ruled as a minority government about 10 seats shy of a working majority in parliament and has operated with the support of the Social Democratic Party and Sakigake.</p>
<p>The left-leaning Social Democrats and the populist Sakigake have expressed reluctance to back special legislation to expropriate the land. The Democrats, a centre-left grouping formed six months ago from lawmakers who split those two parties, have not made their position clear on Okinawa.</p>
<p>Some Democrats had wanted to work with the Hashimoto government to press for economic and fiscal reforms, arguing that there was no way to influence government policy from the opposition wilderness.</p>
<p>Kan said however that Hashimoto's LDP was too beholden to vested interests to seriously trim state spending or take on Japan's powerful bureaucracy. As an example, he cited the Hashimoto government's 1997 budget, which he dismissed as &quot;traditional pork-barrel spending&quot;.</p>
<p>The Democrats, which hold 52 seats in the 500-seat Lower House of parliament and 15 in the 252-seat Upper House, will concentrate on Tokyo assembly and Upper house elections in the coming 16 months, Kan said.</p>
<p>Hashimoto has seen his public approval rating erode constantly in his 14 months in office but has faced no pressure because the opposition has been in disarray.</p>
<p>In addition to the Democrats' struggle over their identity, the largest opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) has been dogged by scandals and embroiled in bitter leadership disputes.</p>
