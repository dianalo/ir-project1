<p>Nordic skiing champion Bjorn Daehlie has welcomed the pre-race blood tests introduced at this year's world championships after continuing allegations of blood doping in the sport.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's the way it should be done,&quot; said Norwegian Daehlie, the winner of two gold medals already at the 10-day world championships which opened on Friday.</p>
<p>Daehlie, the most successful cross-country skier of all time, said he had been tested before the first race, the men's 30-km freestyle, in which he came second to Russian Alexei Prokurorov.</p>
<p>Some competitors complained about having to get up early to go to the pre-race tests, which are being used for the first time in world championships.</p>
<p>&quot;I had to go about 40 minutes before the start and it only lasted about five minutes,&quot; Daehlie said. &quot;As far as I'm concerned it's really not a problem.&quot;</p>
<p>The pre-race tests were conducted for the first time in any Olympic sport at a World Cup meeting last month in Hakuba, Japan, but had never been used in world championships before.</p>
<p>There has been blood testing in Nordic skiing since the 1989 world championships in Lahti, Finland, but it was done only after the competitions, explained Jon-Olav Drogset, chief doctor of the doping control commission of the Trondheim championhips.</p>
<p>&quot;What is new is that we now do blood testing before the races to detect unusually high haemoglobin levels and that had never been done in world championships,&quot; Drogset told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We do testing on 20 per cent of the starters selected randomly before the races,&quot; he added. &quot;They have to come up to 90 minutes before the race, depending on the number of starters. We take a very small amount of blood from a vein in the forearm. It takes about five minutes to determine the haemoglobin level. If it's found to be over the limit, the athlete is excluded straight away and does not start the race.&quot;</p>
<p>After each race, the first four plus two others chosen randomly undergo more blood tests as well as the routine urine tests.</p>
<p>&quot;After the race, we take a greater amount of blood,&quot; Drogset said, adding that the blood and urine samples were then sent to a laboratory accredited by the International Olympic Committee in Oslo to be analysed.</p>
<p>Pre-race tests were used in Trondheim before every cross-country and Nordic combined event while the ski jumpers are submitted only to the post-race tests, he said.</p>
<p>Haemoglobin in red blood cells transports oxygen around the body and its level can be increased through blood doping, a technique in which blood is taken from an athlete's body and pumped back just before competition.</p>
<p>Injecting erythropoietin (EPO) has a similar effect as the banned substance stimulates the production of red blood cells.</p>
<p>High haemoglobin levels boost endurance by enabling the blood to transport more oxygen to working muscles. But they make the blood thicken and can lead to heart attacks.</p>
<p>Inggard Lereim of Norway, the vice-chairman of the medical commission of the International Ski Federation (FIS), voiced concern about high haemoglobin levels in cross-country skiing a year ago, saying some athletes were threatening their lives.</p>
<p>Pressed by some of the sport's top competitors, FIS launched the pre-race blood tests after setting limits for haemoglobin levels at 16.5 grams per litre of blood for women and 18.5 g for men.</p>
<p>The new tests, which have been welcomed by almost every leading competitor in Trondheim, could be used at next year's winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, a source close to FIS said.</p>
