<p>Hutu rebels launched a major attack on an army garrison and local government headquarters in northwestern Burundi on Tuesday, killing many people including the local administrator, an army spokesman said.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Isaie Nibizi told Reuters fighting was continuing at Gahombo commune between Kayanza and Ngozi towns and the Tutsi-dominated army was pouring reinforcements into the area.</p>
<p>It was one of the few, if any, attacks reported by Burundi's army on its positions.</p>
<p>&quot;The rebels attacked the military post, the displaced camp and the administrative headquarters. It was a big attack and it is still continuing. We have sent for reinforcements,&quot; Nibizi added.</p>
<p>&quot;The rebels perpetrated a major attack at Gahombo. They have killed the local administrator and there are many civilian casualties as well,&quot; said Jean-Luc Ndizeye, spokesman for Burundi's Tutsi military ruler Pierre Buyoya who seized power on July 25.</p>
<p>In Nairobi, an official of the exiled main Hutu rebel group National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), told Reuters the attack in Kayanza was being carried out by its armed wing -- Forces for the Defence of Democracy -- in a strategy to cut off Burundi from neighbouring Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;Our programme is to take over the regions of Kayanza, Bubanza and Kirundo and cut off the country from Rwanda,&quot; she said. The official accused Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated military of aiding the Burundi army in the tiny country's ferocious war which aid workers say is killing 1,000 people monthly.</p>
<p>Tuesday's attack came four days after the rebels killed civilians in heavy fighting in the same region and destroyed government buildings.</p>
<p>Stepping up their attacks after a month of sanctions against the Tutsi military which seized power on June 29, the rebels hit Gatara village five km (three miles) south of Kayanza town on Saturday.</p>
<p>State-run Burundi radio said all government buildings were destroyed in Gatara,</p>
<p>Civilians have paid the heaviest price in Burundi's ehtnic strife which has killed more than 150,000 people in the last three years, fuelling fears of slaughter on a scale similar to Rwanda's 1994 genocide in which up to one million were killed.</p>
