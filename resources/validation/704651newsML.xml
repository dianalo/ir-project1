<headline>Czech Nomura unit takes Radegast stake.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1996-07-04</dateline>

<p>Nomura Capital s.r.o., a Czech subsidiary of Nomura International plc, acquired a 12.58 percent stake in Czech brewer Pivovar Radegast a.s., according to the latest filings with the Czech Central Securities Registry (SCP).  </p>
<p>The SCP records also showed that Czech bank IPB a.s. reduced its stake in the brewer from 19.53 percent on June 30 to below 10 percent on July 3.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, records of transactions at the SCP reveal that 100,000 Radegast shares, a number equal to the stake Nomura acquired, traded over-the-counter in a block at 6,150 crowns per share on June 30. SCP records do not show counterparties in trades.</p>
<p>When asked about the transaction, IPB spokesman Jan Rezek would not directly confirm the transaction, but he told Reuters: &quot;It can be quite easily deduced from the circumstances.&quot; He referred any further comment to Nomura.</p>
<p>Radegast shares rose 21 crowns to 3,561 at the Prague Stock Exchange on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Czech daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted a bank spokesman as saying that the bank has divested stakes in several large comanies recently.</p>
<p>Britain's Bass plc holds a 33 percent stake in Radegast, and has revealed its intentions to increase its holdings in the company.  </p>
<p>Nomura recently has been working closely in financial deals with IPB, and its subsidiary Nutshell s.r.o. holds a five percet stake in the Czech bank.</p>
<p>Nomura is also widely expected to win a Czech government tender to take a 36 percent stake in the bank.</p>
<p>Rezek said the bank's long-term strategy was divesting of its holdings in companies through standard trade operations.</p>
<p>He did confirm a report in the Czech daily Mlada Fronta on Thursday that IPB had divested stakes in another brewer, Plzensky Prazdroj a.s. to Netherland's registered Quartermaine Investment Fund.</p>
<p>He also confirmed said that stakes in the ceramics factory Chlumcanske Keramicke Zavody a.s. and the malt trading firm Obchodni Sladovny were sold to Quartermaine as well, and that a stake in porcelain producer Karlovarsky Porcelan was divested to another party.</p>
<p>He declined further comment on Quartermaine, based in Rotterdam.</p>
