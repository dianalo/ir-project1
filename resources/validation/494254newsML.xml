<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi urged all parties in parliament on Tuesday to back deployment of an Italian-led security force in Albania in a vote that has split his fragile alliance and put him at risk of humiliation.</p>
<p>Addressing the Senate (upper house) ahead of a vote scheduled for later in the day, the centre-left leader said both Italian credibility abroad and the fate of Albanians would be at risk if Italy failed to live up to its task.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is asking the whole parliament to support the effort that this country is being asked to make,&quot; Prodi said. &quot;It is not rhetoric but the pure and simple truth to say that the whole world is watching us.&quot;</p>
<p>Prodi, in office 11 months, faces a serious split in his coalition over the refusal of parliamentary ally Communist Refoundation to back the 6,000-strong force, due to deploy next week with a mandate to assist relief efforts in lawless Albania.</p>
<p>His government has a majority in its own right in the Senate but cannot survive without Refoundation support in the lower Chamber of Deputies, where a similar vote is due on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Defeat on the government's motion would be a humiliating blow to Prodi and would put strong pressure on him to resign.</p>
<p>His speech, in which he appealed to parties to &quot;put aside the controversies (and) look beyond Italy's own borders&quot;, failed to move the main opposition centre-right Freedom Alliance.</p>
<p>It said on Tuesday it would support the mission, the first of its kind to be led by Italy, but vote against the government resolution and urged Prodi's centre-left Olive Tree coalition to back its own motion instead.</p>
<p>&quot;We are sticking to the position we expressed this morning that the government should vote for our motion,&quot; Freedom Alliance leader Silvio Berlusconi said after Prodi's address.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't understand why the government cannot vote for our resolution and thus resolve this practical problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Berlusconi bloc had initially signalled that it would back the government on sending the force, authorised by a U.N. Security Council resolution on March 28 after armed anarchy exploded in Albania, Europe's poorest state.</p>
<p>It abruptly switched stance on Tuesday after a deputy foreign minister, Piero Fassino, told a meeting of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) that the government believed Albania's rightist President Sali Berisha should leave office.</p>
<p>&quot;Things like this expose our boys (soldiers) to greater risks&quot; in Albania, Berlusconi said.</p>
<p>Fassino's remarks drew a strong diplomatic protest from the Albanian Foreign Ministry, which said they amounted to unacceptable interference in the country's affairs.</p>
<p>Prodi distanced himself from the comments in the Senate, saying Italy was not sending 2,500 troops to Albania to get involved in its complicated politics.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not going there to reaffirm who's on top or to safeguard partisan interests,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going there to offer Albanians the concrete support they need so that they themselves, as is their responsibility, can restore conditions for normal life in their country through free elections.&quot;</p>
<p>Rebel committees holding southern Albanian towns are demanding Berisha's immediate resignation, blaming him for failure to control popular but fraudulent savings schemes whose collapse sparked last month's explosion of violence.</p>
<p>He has said he will quit if his Democratic Party loses early elections due to take place by the end of June under a broad political accord last month that set up an interim national unity government led by opposition Socialist Bashkim Fino.</p>
<p>Prodi told the Senate that Italy expected the security force to stay in Albania for no more than six months and leave at the latest within one month of the elections.</p>
<p>France is planning to contribute some 1,000 troops to the force, Greece 700, Turkey 500, Romania 400 and Spain 300. Austria and Denmark say they are also considering participation.</p>
