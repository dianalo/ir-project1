<p>Asia's leading rice exporters have recently locked in a slew of large sales contracts, but prices are seen coming under pressure in the region as the major Indian harvest gets underway, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Indian companies have signed forward contracts to export nearly 300,000-400,000 tonnes of rice from the new crop in November, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Around 300,000-400,000 tonnes of forward rice export contracts have been signed for November shipments,&quot; said an official in a leading Delhi foodgrains export firm.</p>
<p>India's winter rice harvest has started in the northern states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Harvesting in the other states would start within a week, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;This can be the moving period for Indian rice exports but prices are still ruling higher than Vietnam prices, so Indian rice is not competitive,&quot; said an official in another Delhi foodgrains export firm.</p>
<p>&quot;Indian prices are not friendly vis-a-vis Vietman rice export prices,&quot; said one exporter.</p>
<p>Traders said Indian five percent long grain non-Basmati rice was quoted at around $290 a tonne FOB, 10 percent at $280, 15 percent at $255 and 25 percent at $240.</p>
<p>&quot;The (rice) crop this winter would be a normal one,&quot; said the exporter.</p>
<p>However, traders said rice export contracts will not substantially pick up until the final harvest production is known by late November. &quot;Nothing can be said now. We have to wait and watch,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Industry officials and traders had earlier said India's winter rice production is expected to be marginally higher than last year's winter output of 71 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The winter harvest starts early in October and continues until late in November. India harvests two rice crops, getting the bulk of its output from the winter crop.</p>
<p>Major buying orders from Indonesia and Hong Kong helped brighten up a dull Thai rice market which has been in a lull recently, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But prices remained mostly steady as exporters bought just enough rice to cover their immediate needs.</p>
<p>Thai benchmark 100 percent grade B rice was quoted around $320-$340 a tonne, barely changed from last week. Prices of lower grade rice, however, eased slightly.</p>
<p>Traders see more orders coming in November and December when fresh supply is expected to pull the prices down and make Thai rice attractive.</p>
<p>&quot;I know I said this before but I will say it again. The prices at the moment are a bit expensive. Buyers will wait a bit before entering the market again,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;The prospects are still good. Exports this year will meethe said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong rice importers signed a memorandum of understanding last week with Thai rice exporters to buy 270,000 tonnes of high quality rice in 1997.</p>
<p>The Thai government also this week approved a counter trade deal between Thailand and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Indonesia will buy 110,000 tonnes of various grades of Thai rice for delivery between November and February while Thai will buy two aircraft from Indonesia.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides those orders, there are some small orders from our regular customers like Singapore, the United States and Malaysia,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, export rice prices have softened over the last week in dull trade with dealers seeing little immediate prospect of a change in the situation.</p>
<p>Traders in Ho Chi Minh City and elsewhere in Indochina said five percent broken grade was trading at around $265 a tonne FOB Saigon Port, down slightly from around $275 last week.</p>
<p>&quot;New harvests are appearing in places like Iran and the Philippines. So demand seems to be tailing off in quite a few places,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Dealers added that floods affecting Vietnam's Mekong Delta had had little impact on rice so far, thanks to early harvesting.</p>
<p>Vietnam's Saigon Giai Phong newspaper reported on Thursday that farmers had rushed to transport rice to Ho Chi Minh City for export ahead of the Mekong Delta floods.</p>
<p>The paper said the resultant excess supply had contributed to the current drop in prices.</p>
