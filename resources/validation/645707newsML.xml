<p>Recent strength in the Australian wool market over recent weeks shows no significant signs of abating, Wesfarmers Dalgety Ltd said.</p>
<p>&quot;Orders are still flowing through to the market from a wide range of buyers, with particularly active interest from the Chinese and Japanese,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The depreciation of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar has made the price of wool to overseas buyers relatively less expensive and this trend seems likely to continue, it said.</p>
<p>This would assist exporters, especially those buying for the price-sensitive Chinese mills, it said.  </p>
<p>Limited wool supply has been a major factor encouraging competition and the downward revision of this week's offering, to 54,622 bales, would reinforce this, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The only note of caution is that the consistent market gains over the last three weeks may cause buying activity to ease somewhat, but this would not be likely to cause the market to actually fall,&quot; it said. &quot;Therefore, wool prices are predicted to be firm again (this) week,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The eastern market indicator rose 14 cents to a 21-month high of 714 cents a kg clean last week.</p>
