<p>Germany's federal and state government increased their borrowing activities at the beginning of the year, the Bundesbank said in its March report.</p>
<p>The central bank said the Bonn government's cash deficit stood at 31.69 billion marks during January and February 1997, twice as high as the 15.18 cash deficit from January and February 1996.</p>
<p>But the Bundesbank also said it was difficult to construct a trend for the entire year based on the first two months. &quot;The cash deficits are strongly influenced by certain shifts and impacted by the developments of revenues and expenses,&quot; the Bundesbank wrote, adding &quot;Consequently it is not possible to draw conclusions for the entire year based on the first two months.&quot;</p>
<p>In February, the federal government's net borrowing totalled about nine billion marks after reaching 15.6 billion marks in January. In January 1996 the government's net borrowing totalled 8.3 billion marks</p>
<p>State governments borrowed 5.7 billion marks in January 1997 compared with 4.8 billion marks in January 1996 while local governments borrowed 500 million marks compared with two billion marks a year ago.</p>
