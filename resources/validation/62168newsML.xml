<p>Uncertainty in Israel deepened on Wednesday over whether most of a government-appointed committee's recommendations on capital market reform would be approved.</p>
<p>After the Tel Aviv market closed on Tuesday the committee, led by Finance Ministry Director General David Brodett, presented a 100-page proposal aimed at encouraging long-term savings and stimulating investment in the capital market.</p>
<p>Several recommendations provoked immediate and widespread outcry -- from legislators and the Histadrut labour federation to the Bank of Israel and the director-general of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.</p>
<p>The reaction caused Israeli shares to edge lower with the benchmark Mishtanim Index down 0.52 percent at 195.56 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Netanyahu took office three months ago promising to revive the ailing stock market, privatise nearly 100 companies and open the Israeli economy to competition.</p>
<p>But analysts noted he also promised not to hurt savings.</p>
<p>The committee's most controversial proposals include taxing savings of less than 10 years and reducing the amount pension funds can invest in special high-yielding government bonds.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no chance Netanyahu will tax short-term savings. As soon as you remove this measure you're left with all kinds of pieces. It's not certain what will happen to the other recommendations,&quot; said Eli Nahum, head of trading at Zannex Securities.</p>
<p>Roger Hornett of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities in London said the Israeli media has concentrated on changes concerning short-term savings and pension plans. This is only a small part of a reform package that Hornett said was a very good start for the new government.</p>
<p>Other measures call for lowering the tax on dividends, creating a secondary mortgage market and allowing institutional investors to invest more in foreign securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock market is probably wrong-footed at the moment and will be much more appreciative of the measures as days pass by,&quot; Hornett said.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot is being done to the secondary market and the globalisation of markets, bringing in foreign investors. This is a major step forward as far as the liberalisation of capital markets is concerned,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Hornett praised Netanyahu, saying he had a strong understanding of the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Here you have 100-page recommendation that will now be debated. This is very fast work...Netanyahu understands the importance of capital markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Economic commentators also applauded the committee's recommendations as a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>&quot;The committee...had the guts to spell out just how illogical and inequitable is the patchwork of tax breaks and liabilities that currently exist in various savings and investment mechanisms, although it will be derided and scorned as a result,&quot; wrote Pinchas Landau in the Jerusalem Post.</p>
