<p>A think-tank charged with the job of shaping the economic policy of Nigeria's ruling generals is pushing for widespread privatisation and further liberalisation to bring in investment and stimulate growth.</p>
<p>A newly-released report of &quot;The Economic Summit&quot; following its meeting in September says this is the only way that Africa's most populous nation can live up to its potential and avoid slipping further behind the rest of the world.</p>
<p>&quot;Resumption of privatisation will propel market capitalisation, widen public participation and create opportunity for meaningful foreign funds inflow,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;The 1995 and 1996 budgets provided two consecutive years of continuity and consistency in economic policies. The 1997 budget must capitalise on this foundation.&quot;</p>
<p>While Nigeria is an international pariah for alleged human rights abuses and lack of democracy, the economic policies of military ruler General Sani Abacha have received cautious approval from Western diplomats in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Tight fiscal policy has cut annual inflation to around 30 percent from more than 70 percent in little over a year, though there are few signs of economic growth.</p>
<p>At the economic summit Abacha set out his own idea for &quot;Vision 2010&quot;, an economic plan into the next century on which a 172-member committee started working last week.</p>
<p>The Economic Summit group which included many of Nigeria's leading businessmen as well as government officials, recommended privatisation of almost all state-run enterprises including the crude oil sector on which the country is almost totally reliant for revenue.</p>
<p>&quot;It is recommended that government should issue a clear and unambiguous statement on privatisation,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Although finance minister Anthony Ani has repeatedly said the government is committed to further privatisation little action has been taken and many analysts anxiously await the 1997 budget due on January 1 for a definite commitment.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Summit recommended an increase in funding for oil exploration and production to meet the government's stated target of increasing crude output to 2.5 million barrels per day by the year 2000, from around two million bpd at the moment.</p>
<p>The report also stressed the importance of a management strategy to deal with an external debt which at the end of 1995 totalled more than $32 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Whilst the absolute size of Nigeria's external debt is significant the main concern remains the lack of a succesful resolution of the Paris Club debt,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The Paris Club debt, owed to Western governments, accounts for around 65 percent of the total and can in theory be rescheduled. Nigeria says it is close to agreeing a medium-term economic programme with the World Bank, but analysts say talks on rescheduling remain far off.</p>
<p>Relations with the West soured with the November 1995 execution of author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority rights activists for murder.</p>
<p>Although calls from some quarters for meaningful economic sanctions have been ignored, pressure on the military government has made its discussions with the outside world more difficult.</p>
