<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures, helped by some afternoon short covering, mostly ended higher Wednesday in fairly active trade, then lost ground on ACCESS after weekly U.S. inventory data, sources said.</p>
<p>September, the day's only loser, eased 0.3 cent to close at $2.472 per million British thermal units, then slipped to $2.425 on ACCESS shortly after the AGA report. At 1630 EDT, the spot month was still down 1.2 cents at $2.46.</p>
<p>Earlier, October settled 1.5 cents higher at $2.493, while other deferreds ended unchanged to up 1.5 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;The (AGA) number is relatively neutral - it's right where we thought it would be - but people had to do something and they sold it off a little,&quot; said one Texas-based trader.</p>
<p>AGA said Wednesday that U.S. gas inventories rose last week by 78 bcf, in line with expectations in the 70-80 bcf range. Eastern stocks increased by 62 bcf and remained 35 bcf, or three percent, over last year. Consuming region west storage, which gained two bcf last week, continued to lag 1996 levels by two percent. Stocks in the producing region, which rose 14 bcf on the week, were still 25 percent above last year.</p>
<p>While the AGA number was widely viewed as neutral, traders said mild weather this week and next raised expectations for significant stock builds in coming weeks, relaxing some concerns about storage.</p>
<p>While Midwest and Northeast temperatures are expected to briefly warm for the weekend, weather in most regions is not expected to drift far from normal into early next week.</p>
<p>Technical traders pegged key September resistance at the contract high and double top at $2.605, with further selling likely at the $2.64-2.655 spot continuation chart gap from late January. Support was seen at $2.34 and $2.30, with better buying likely at $2.25-2.27.</p>
<p>In the cash Wednesday, Gulf Coast prices skidded more than a dime to the low-$2.40s. Midcon pipes tumbled a similar amount to the low-to-mid $2.30s. New York city gate gas was talked more than 10 cents lower in the low-$2.60s.</p>
<p>The NYMEX Henry Hub 12-month strip edged up 0.4 cent to $2.362. NYMEX said 65,021 contracts traded, up from Tuesday's revised tally of 60,936.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, September finished two cents higher at $2.395, while deferreds ended up by one to two cents. The East/West spread narrowed by 2.3 cents to 7.7 cents (NYMEX premium). KCBT said 225 lots traded, down from Tuesday's total of 372.</p>
