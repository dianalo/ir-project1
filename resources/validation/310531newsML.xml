<p>Palestinians slapped fresh paint on Hebron storefronts on Wednesday in anticipation of self-rule, but fears of violence by Jewish settlers shone through on the volatile streets of the West Bank town.</p>
<p>&quot;God willing it will be a good agreement. But the Palestinians have to be on guard against the settlers,&quot; said Awad Misk, a shopkeeper, after Israel and the PLO initialled a deal on an Israeli troop pullback from most of the town.</p>
<p>&quot;Naturally the settlers will not leave us alone. It is almost certain that they will try to attack us,&quot; he said, referring to the New Year's Day wounding of seven Arabs by an off-duty Israeli soldier who shot into a Hebron market.</p>
<p>Some 400 Jews live or study in Hebron, home to more than 100,000 Palestinians, and will continue to hold on to their enclaves in the town guarded by Israeli soldiers.</p>
<p>Jews and Arabs will continue to rub shoulders on the streets -- but keep well apart, divided by a wall and watched by Israeli soldiers and video cameras at the Tomb of the Patriarchs, which Moslems call al-Ibrahimi mosque.</p>
<p>A Jewish settler massacred 29 Arab worshippers at the shrine in 1994 before he was killed by survivors.</p>
<p>&quot;A sad morning,&quot; said Aharon Domb, a settler spokesman, about the Israel-PLO deal.</p>
<p>There was no sign of much joy among Palestinians in Hebron, either.</p>
<p>Many Arab merchants and craftsmen on Hebron's main Martyrs' street said they still did not know whether they would end up living in an area Israel will hand over to Palestinian police or remain under Israeli occupation.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know what's going to happen to us. And we don't know whether the settlers would leave us alone or not,&quot; said Abu Marwan, who sells garments on Martyrs' street.</p>
<p>&quot;Wouldn't it have been better for both of us Arabs and Jews had the agreement made the settlers leave us alone?,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On the morning after the deal was sealed, Palestinians went about their business as usual in Hebron.</p>
<p>So did Israeli soldiers -- for now. They stood guard, fingers on the triggers of assault rifles, on street corners and in front of settler enclaves scattered across the heart of the town.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not believe that they have reached an agreement until I see things being implemented on the ground,&quot; said a 60- year-old retired Palestinian man who declined to give his name.</p>
<p>&quot;I am afraid that the Jews have obtained what they wanted from this agreement. But still, I believe that the situation may improve when the Palestinian Authority takes over,&quot; he said.</p>
