<p>The Woolwich Building Society said on Wednesday that it expected to issue 1.6 billion ordinary shares to members when stock exchange dealings commence on July 7.</p>
<p>The Woolwich, one of four mutually-owned British building societies coming to the stock market this year, reiterated that it would be sending out statements to around 2.5 million of its members eligible for free shares detailing their allocations between now and June 6.  </p>
<p>In its listing particulars, the group said a free share sale facility would be offered to those wanting to sell their shares immediately, through auctions administered by BZW Securities.</p>
<p>Up to four auctions will be held on consecutive days -- the first on Monday, July 7 -- between 1530 and 1730 GMT. The number of auctions held will depend on the number of shares offered for sale, details on both of which will be announced on July 3.</p>
<p>All sellers will receive the same price, calculated as the total proceeds divided by the total number of shares sold. The results of each auction will be announced at 0700 GMT on the business day following each auction.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that members who are eligible to receive free shares will choose to retain them,&quot; said chief executive John Stewart in the statement. &quot;As customers, they can be confident of our determination to maintain the high standards that they expect of us&quot;.</p>
