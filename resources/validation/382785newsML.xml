<p>Portugal's President Jorge Sampaio leaves on Monday for a two-week trip to Macau and China with the 1999 handover of power in the Portuguese-administered territory and commercial links with Peking topping the agenda.</p>
<p>Sampaio, who is making his first visit to the Far East since taking office in March 1996, arrives in Macau on Tuesday for a six-day stay before travelling on to China.</p>
<p>The president, who under Portugal's constitution has direct responsibility for Macau, will meet government and business leaders during his visit to the tiny enclave on the western lip of the Pearl River delta.</p>
<p>Portugal is due to hand over the territory on December 31, 1999, two and a half years after Britain relinquishes control over nearby Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Unlike in Hong Kong, where the transition to Chinese rule has been tense and marked by frequent rows, the planned Portuguese withdrawal from Macau has so far provoked few diplomatic disputes between Peking and Lisbon.</p>
<p>But this does not mean that there are no outstanding issues to be resolved over the future of the territory and its 420,000-strong population, diplomats say.</p>
<p>Presidential officials made clear that Sampaio, a mild-mannered, Socialist lawyer, will make no public reference to human rights during his trip to China, where he arrives on Sunday. Lisbon's policy is that such issues are better dealt with by the European Union, of which Portugal is a member.</p>
<p>But he is expected to press Chinese government officials for guarantees on civil liberties and the protection of rights, such as freedom of the press and religion, in Macau after the Portuguese withdraw.</p>
<p>Sampaio is due to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister Li Peng and Qiao Shi, chairman of the standing committee of the National People's congress, or parliament, during his visit.</p>
<p>While Peking has no problem with the 10,000 or so ethnic Portuguese in Macau retaining their passports, there is no formal accord yet over the status of some 100,000 ethnic Chinese with Portuguese documents.</p>
<p>The 100-strong delegation travelling with Sampaio to Peking includes Economy Minister Augusto Mateus and a host of top businessmen in a sign that commerce as well as diplomacy will feature prominently in discussions.</p>
<p>Portugal's annual trade with China amounts to no more than $250 million, most of it Chinese exports, and Lisbon is looking to secure closer trade and business ties before leaving Macau after a stay of some 450 years.</p>
