<title>PHILIPPINES: Peace pact sparks protests in Philippine city.</title>
<headline>Peace pact sparks protests in Philippine city.</headline>
<dateline>ZAMBOANGA, Philippines 1996-09-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Thousands of Christians protested in this southern Philippine city on Tuesday against a government peace pact with Moslem rebels, demanding firearms to back up their opposition.</p>
<p>Shouting &quot;We want arms&quot; and &quot;Guns, guns&quot;, about 5,000 people attended a mock funeral symbolising what they regard as the death of democracy in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Bus and pedicab drivers joined in the protest by staging a strike, while banks, shops and schools shut down in sympathy.</p>
<p>Zamboanga city officials say Christians have started forming militia units to oppose the pact which was signed in Manila on Monday. The deal formally ended a 24-year secessionist revolt which killed more than 120,000 people on the main southern island of Mindanao and adjacent islands.</p>
<p>The peace accord involves setting up a rebel-led administrative council to supervise development in 14 southern provinces, to be followed three years later by a plebiscite and regional autonomy.</p>
<p>The country's five million Moslems regard Mindanao as their ancestral homeland, although they are now outnumbered 3-to-1 in the area by Christian settlers.</p>
<p>Christians see the pact as a sell-out to Moslem interests.</p>
