<p>Metal Management Inc said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Cozzi Iron &amp; Metal Inc and its interests in two joint ventures for $6 million in cash and 11.5 million Metal shares.</p>
<p>Both companies are Chicago-based scrap metal handlers.</p>
<p>Brothers Albert and Frank Cozzi will join Metal's senior executive team and its board, Metal said.</p>
<p>Albert Cozzi will be president and the chief operating officer of the merged companies, Metal said.</p>
<p>Benjamin Jennings will be chairman and Gerard Jacobs will remain chief executive of the merged companies.  </p>
<p>At closing, Albert, Frank and Greg Cozzi, as well as Jennings and Jacobs, will enter into five-year employment agreements which will, among other things, grant warrants to purchase an aggregate of three million shares of the company's common stock, Metal said.</p>
<p>Half the warrants issued will be exercisable at $5.91 per share and the other half will be exercisable at a price equal to 75 percent of the stock's closing price on the day before the closing of the Cozzi merger, Metal said.</p>
<p>In addition, Albert, Frank and Greg Cozzi and Jennings and Jacobs will enter into a 10-year agreement to, among other things, vote their shares together in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>&quot;When the Cozzi merger is completed, these five individuals will own, directly or indirectly, approximately 16 million shares of the company's common stock on a fully diluted basis. Giving effect to the Cozzi merger, as of today the company would have approximately 30 million shares of common stock on a fully-diluted basis,&quot; Metal said.</p>
