<p>Australia's tourism chief on Thursday urged all Australians to show a friendly face to Asian visitors, saying the nation's race row endangered its most valuable export industry.</p>
<p>Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) managing director John Morse said the country's friendly image was at risk over the &quot;Hanson issue&quot;, referring to far-right lawmaker Pauline Hanson's calls for curbs on Asian immigration.</p>
<p>&quot;There's never been a greater need nor a greater opportunity for Australia to demonstrate just how friendly and welcoming this country can be,&quot; Morse told a conference in Melbourne.</p>
<p>&quot;If we lose our image as a friendly and welcoming country, then our whole tourism industry is at risk.&quot;</p>
<p>Morse was speaking before next week's Australian Tourism Exchange, a major trade fair where travel companies from around the world, many of them Asian, shop around for Australian holiday packages to offer their customers.</p>
<p>The government's ATC estimates business worth A$2.1 billion (US$1.58 billion) will be written at this year's fair.</p>
<p>Asia, excluding Japan, is the fastest-growing source of visitors for Australia's A$16 billion tourism industry. Japanese tourism to Australia is declining but still accounts for a fifth of all visitors to the country.</p>
<p>The anti-immigration backlash led by Hanson has alarmed the industry. Since Hanson warned last year that she felt Australia was in danger of being &quot;swamped&quot; by Asians, some Asian tour groups have cancelled trips to Australia, fearing racial abuse.</p>
<p>Australia's Tourism Task Force, a tourism industry lobby group, has urged the government to fund an Asian publicity campaign to counteract the offshore publicity given to Hanson.</p>
<p>But Morse said old-fashioned hospitality and a smile would do more than an advertising campaign to reverse the harm done to Australia's image in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;I've adopted the habit now of talking to people in the street who are Asians...,&quot; Morse told Reuters. &quot;You can see their faces light up.&quot;</p>
