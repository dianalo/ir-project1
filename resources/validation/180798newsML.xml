<p>The head of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation, Jacques Diouf, said on Monday he regretted that Latin American leaders had staged their own meeting on the eve of FAO's World Food Summit in Rome.</p>
<p>Diouf, FAO's Senegalese director-general, has said for weeks that 100 heads of state and government will attend the five-day meeting, which opens on Wednesday and will approve a plan of action to eradicate world hunger.</p>
<p>He repeated the figure on Monday but again declined to name names, saying the U.N. agency still did not have all the information it needed about when leaders would arrive.</p>
<p>&quot;We are waiting for faxes confirming arrivals and lists of delegations,&quot; Diouf told a news conference.</p>
<p>An informal list of participants, based on information to Reuters from governments and diplomatic sources, shows at least 54 presidents or prime ministers are so far expected to come.</p>
<p>Asked about attendance from Latin America by a journalist who said he believed only three leaders would come from there, Diouf acknowledged that there were problems.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that it is not a good thing because this summit is particularly for countries which have hunger, which have poverty in the rural sector,&quot; said Diouf, speaking in Spanish.</p>
<p>&quot;I also think that organising a summit one week ahead of the food summit...was not the best way to help us in the success of this summit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Ibero-American Summit in Chile opened on Saturday, with leaders from 19 regional nations plus Spain and Portugal. It was ending on Monday with Cuban President Fidel Castro expected to be among the handful of participants later travelling to Rome.</p>
<p>&quot;There are countries which are not going to come at the level of heads of state (from Latin America) but their vice-presidents are going to come and take part in the summit and so we will have representation at an adequate level,&quot; Diouf said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I could not say today what the situation will be within two or three days because there are contacts between these countries and FAO to ensure that more heads of state come.&quot;</p>
<p>Of the Group of Seven countries, the world's richest nations, only host country Italy will be represented at the highest level. The United States is sending Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.</p>
<p>Preparatory talks have already brought agreement on two summit texts, which contain a specific commitment to reduce the number of undernourished people in the world to half the present level of 840 million by no later than the year 2015.</p>
<p>The documents have faced criticism from development activists who say they are either utopian, too vague because based on consensus or unlikely to be more than words because they do not have legal force.</p>
<p>Diouf said he hoped the documents would not &quot;be put in drawers&quot; once the summit was over.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not naive. I don't think that just because you have a summit the whole world will say everybody is nice and beautiful and we will all agree and kiss each other,&quot; Diouf said.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that if governments come and agree to do something, they should at least have the benefit of the doubt that they would respect what they are committed to until they don't&quot; respect it, he said.</p>
