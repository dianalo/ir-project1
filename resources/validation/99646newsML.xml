<title>BRAZIL: Brazil analysts said Licht sugar figure too high.</title>
<headline>Brazil analysts said Licht sugar figure too high.</headline>
<dateline>RIO DE JANEIRO 1996-10-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>An estimate by German statistician F.O. Licht of a 1996/97 Brazilian sugar crop of 15.02 million tonnes is seen as excessive by Brazilian analysts and industry associations.</p>
<p>&quot;This is too high and over-exaggerated. Our most optimistic figure is for a little over 13 million tonnes,&quot; said Jose Pilon, president of the Sao Paulo Sugar and Alcohol Industries Association (AIAA).</p>
<p>It was also very difficult at this stage to give an accurate crop estimate given that the harvest in the north/northeast had only really just gotten underway.  </p>
<p>&quot;Also this year's harvest in the center-south started earlier than normal so if it finishes earlier than usual, you have one estimate,&quot; Pilon said.</p>
<p>&quot;But if it carries on right to the end of the normal harvesting period, then you have another scenario completely,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The country's harvest in the center-south, the main producing region, traditionally runs from May to November.</p>
<p>This year however it began in some places as early as April 15 leading to differences as to exactly how this year's crop is running compared with that of 1995/96.  </p>
<p>The AIAA is still using the official starting point as May 1, so that by September 15, the center-south crop totalled 7.12 million tonnes, up 16 percent from the same date last year according to the AIAA.</p>
<p>However analyst Aloisio Sotero of independent consultants DataNet-Agricommodities is comparing fortnightly periods rather than dates and so sees the crop as showing a much more subdued increase over the corresponding period last season.</p>
<p>As a result Sotero also sees Licht's forecast as too high.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an over-estimate which reflects the view of producers,&quot; Sotero said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Producers have said this crop will be 10 percent more than last year just to persuade the government to release remaining export quotas,&quot; he said, pointing out the forecast was roughly 10 percent up on Licht's 1995/96 figure of 13.64 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Sotero is planning to release his own estimate of the crop later this week.</p>
<p>The AIAA also does not agree with Licht figure for the 1995/96 crop which it puts at around 12.4 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The government crop plan has allowed for output of 13.68 million tonnes of sugar, of which 5.2 million tonnes may in theory be exported free of export tax.</p>
<p>So far however the government has only authorised 80 percent of this total and traders and producers in the center-south say they are now waiting for the release of the remaining 20 percent before being able to make further overseas sales.</p>
<p>The head of the primary commodities department at the Industry and Commerce Ministry, Mauricio Assis, said that the authorisation was &quot;in the final stages of technical analysis.</p>
<p>Assis declined to comment on the Licht estimate.</p>
