<title>UK: CRICKET-LATE LEWIS DROPPED FROM ONE-DAY SQUAD.</title>
<headline>CRICKET-LATE LEWIS DROPPED FROM ONE-DAY SQUAD.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>England all-rounder Chris Lewis has been dropped from the one-day squad to face Pakistan starting on Thursday after turning up late at The Oval on the fourth day of the final test on Sunday.</p>
<p>Lewis was still not in the dressing-room 45 minutes before play began and, when he did arrive, chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth abruptly informed him he had been replaced in the squad by uncapped Kent fast bowler Dean Headley.</p>
<p>The mercurial Lewis has endured an increasingly disappointing season after being recalled to the England set-up at the start of the season, only just managing to hold his place for The Oval test despite an unimpressive display at Headingley in the previous test.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old Surrey player is not exactly a stranger to controversy but, ironically, has claimed to have rediscovered his motivation since moving back to London to live closer to his family after stints with Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire.</p>
<p>The Lewis rumpus totally overshadowed the surprise inclusion of Graham Lloyd, son of national coach David, in a much-changed squad of 13.</p>
<p>Four others in the team contesting the final test at the Oval have been either dropped or rested, with Lancashire batsman Lloyd, Surrey all-rounder Adam Hollioake and Headley all given initial chances to impress.</p>
<p>Darren Gough, Matthew Maynard, Ronnie Irani and Peter Martin have been recalled to the international set-up, with tour certainties Dominic Cork, Nasser Hussain and John Crawley rested and Ian Salisbury and test 12th man Andy Caddick omitted.</p>
<p>Squad: Michael Atherton (captain), Alec Stewart, Graham Thorpe, Nick Knight, Graham Lloyd, Matthew Maynard, Ronnie Irani, Adam Hollioake, Robert Croft, Darren Gough, Peter Martin, Dean Headley, Alan Mullally.</p>
