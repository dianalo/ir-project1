<p>America's royal family, the Kennedys, appear to come up short when it comes to &quot;family values&quot; after a week that saw one member accused of sleeping with a teenage babysitter and another apologising to his ex-wife for his bad behaviour.</p>
<p>&quot;Life sometimes is a bit of a struggle for everybody, and our family is no different from any other. It just gets a little more attention I guess, as you can kind of see,&quot; Representative Joseph Kennedy, the son of slain Sen. Robert Kennedy, told reporters who questioned him about his brother Michael's alleged affair with a 14-year-old.</p>
<p>Their glamour and their tragedies may have caused Americans to take the Kennedy family into their hearts, but the litany of assignations, alcohol and drug abuse associated with their name may be causing at least some Massachusetts voters to have a change of heart.</p>
<p>The latest polls show the congressman, who is preparing a bid for the 1998 governor's race, has lost the huge lead he enjoyed four months ago over an almost unknown lieutenant governor and the state's treasurer as a result of the recent scandals.</p>
<p>&quot;For generations ... Kennedy men were brought up to prove their manhood by going out and having sexual conquests. I thought that pattern was broken, but alas maybe it isn't,&quot; Lawrence Leamer, author of &quot;The Kennedy Women,&quot; said in an interview.</p>
<p>The litany of extramarital affairs can be traced back to the congressman's grandfather, millionaire businessman Joseph P. Kennedy, for whom he was named.</p>
<p>That Kennedy, who made part of his vast fortune through riding a wild stockmarket during the 1920s Prohibition era, was romantically linked to actresses Gloria Swanson, Constance Bennett and Nancy Carroll among others while married to Rose, the family's matriach, who raised the couple's four sons and five daughters.</p>
<p>CONTROVERSIAL PRIVATE LIVES</p>
<p>The couple's oldest son, Joe Jr., died in World War II, but the others survived to become elected officials with reputations not only as masters of the political arts but for womanizing as well.</p>
<p>The late President John F. Kennedy, sharing his father's taste in actresses, reportedly had affairs with Marilyn Monroe and Gene Tierney. He also kept Judith Campbell Exner (corrects surname from Exeter), the alleged mistress of Chicago mob boss Sam Giancona, as a mistress.</p>
<p>His brother, Robert, who was gunned down while making his own bid to occupy the White House, reportedly shared Monroe with the president, according to Nellie Bly, author of &quot;The Kennedy Men.&quot;</p>
<p>Sen. Edward Kennedy, the only surviving brother, also has a reputation for womanizing and drinking. He was the driver of a car that missed a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island in Martha's Vinyard, off Massachusetts, and as a result, a young woman with him drowned. The accident raised numerous questions about his lifestyle and helped crush his presidential aspirations.</p>
<p>And it was the senator who took his son Patrick, now a congressman from Rhode Island, and his nephew William Kennedy Smith, the son of the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Jean Kennedy and the late Stephen Smith, to a Palm Beach, Fla., nightclub on Good Friday in 1991. Smith would later be accused and acquitted of raping a young woman he met there.</p>
<p>The litany of men in the third generation of Kennedys that have had drug problems can begin with David Kennedy, a son of Robert's. He was found beaten and robbed while trying to buy heroin in Harlem, and eventually died over a drug overdose two years later in 1984.</p>
<p>His cousins Christopher Lawford, Patrick Kennedy, the R.I. congressman, Ted Jr., the senator's son, and Robert Kennedy, Jr. have all been arrested on drug related charges.</p>
<p>&quot;The boys in the family were always brought up to think ... that they had some special mandate and entitlement because they were Kennedys,&quot; Leamer said.</p>
<p>He termed the excesses of alcohol and drugs a &quot;generational problem,&quot; noting many American families have had similar problems.</p>
<p>WHO CAN USE COCAINE?</p>
<p>But as one of Patrick Kennedy's GOP opponents in his 1994 U.S. House race said during the campaign, &quot;In the real world, if I broke the law by using cocaine, I could never have seriously considered running two years later to become a lawmaker for the state. Such behaviour simply would not be tolerated in ordinary mortals.&quot;</p>
<p>It appears some ordinary voters in Massachusetts, a state where no Kennedy has ever lost an election, are tiring of the saga as Joe Kennedy's popularity has plummeted in the polls.</p>
<p>In late-April congressman Kennedy apologised to his ex-wife, Sheila Rauch Kennedy, who is on a national tour promoting her book &quot;Shattered Faith,&quot; the story of how he mistreated her and his attempts to get the marriage annulled.</p>
<p>At about the same time, Michael Kennedy and his wife, Victoria Gifford, daughter of sports commentator Frank Gifford, announced they were separating. Then came reports that a Massachusetts District Attorney was beginning a preliminary inquiry into allegations that he began a sexual relationship with the family's babysitter when she was 14.</p>
<p>Joe Kennedy, indeed, expressed support for his brother Michael while denying any knowledge of the alleged tryst. &quot;I love my brother,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;And that's all I think I should say at this time.&quot;</p>
