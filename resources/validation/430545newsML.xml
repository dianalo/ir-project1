<headline>MSRB pulls proposed amendments to its rule G-32.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-03-10</dateline>

<p>The MSRB made it official on Monday that it is withdrawing its controversial proposal to tighten the deadline by which bond dealers must get final official statements to customers in primary offerings.</p>
<p>But it emphasized that it will continue to monitor the area and &quot;may respond with additional rulemaking if necessary&quot; to make sure investors get bond documents early enough to make informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>Proposed in September 1996, MSRB's draft amendment to its rule G-32 would have moved up the time that a customer gets the final official statement from the date of settlement to the date the final money confirmation is sent by the dealer to the customer.</p>
<p>The board said in a two-page notice on Monday that all of the eight comment letters it got on the proposed amendment to rule G-32 opposed the plan. Rule G-32 sets disclosure standards for new muni issues.</p>
<p>Commenters warned of frequent delays in getting final official statements from issuers and that complying with the draft amendment would require them to delay sending final money confirmations, MSRB said.</p>
<p>The board said while it is withdrawing the amendment, it knows that &quot;compliance problems continue to exist&quot; with rule G-32 and its counterpart rule G-36.</p>
<p>Rule G-36 says dealers must send OSs to MSRB's central repository within one business day after getting it from the issuer and, under no circumstances, later that 10 business days after the date of sale.</p>
<p>&quot;The Board continues to emphasize the need for dealers to examine&quot; their procedures for complying with rules G-32 and G-36 and with the Securities and Exchange Commission's municipal disclosure Rule 15c2-12, the board said.</p>
<p>SEC's Rule 15c2-12 requires underwriters to contract with issuers to ensure that enough final official statements to meet board rules will be available within seven business days of athe date of sale and in time to send final OSs with final money confirmations.</p>
