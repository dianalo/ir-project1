<p>Eighty years after the &quot;Spanish flu&quot; rampaged across the globe, scientists have begun to unravel the mystery of the pandemic that claimed at least 20 million lives.</p>
<p>Scientists at the U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology report in Friday's edition of the journal Science that they have been able to use a preserved slice of lung tissue to figure out part of the genetic code of that spectacularly virulent strain of influenza.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a big medical mystery that people have been curious about for 80 years. But it also has continued medical relevance,&quot; said Ann Reid, a molecular biologist who co-authored the Science paper.</p>
<p>&quot;Pandemics recur -- some say we're overdue for one. And this could help us predict when it is going to be a particularly virulent one,&quot; Reid said.</p>
<p>By understanding the genetic hallmarks of this legendary strain, scientists may be better able to spot lethal strains in the future and mount an appropriate public health defense of mass vaccinations or other precautions.</p>
<p>The 1918-19 influenza epidemic, known at the time as the Spanish flu although it probably originated in Asia, swept across the world, killing at least 20 million and perhaps as many as 40 million people.</p>
<p>About one in four Americans were infected, of which 675,000 died. Stories, perhaps exaggerated, have been passed down of people dropping dead on streetcars.</p>
<p>Normally the flu is a miserable experience but not a deadly one for otherwise healthy people, except the very old or the very young. But the 1918 flu was different, taking a huge toll among people in their 20s and 30s, including soldiers fighting the First World War.</p>
<p>Reid, her co-author Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger and their fellow researchers at the military pathology lab in Washington were able to isolate parts of five of the virus's genes in lung tissue preserved from a 21-year-old U.S. Army private who had been stationed in Fort Jackson, South Carolina. The lab has been preserving tissue since the U.S. Civil War.</p>
<p>The researchers confirmed it was a previously unknown virus closely related to classic &quot;swine&quot; flu, a virus that had moved from pigs to people. Most flu viruses originate in the guts of ducks, and some strains can cross into humans.</p>
<p>Influenza strikes just about every winter, and the virus varies or mutates a bit from one year to the next. Scientists sometimes call that a &quot;drift&quot;, and monitor the virus so they can adjust the annual vaccine that doctors recommend to the elderly or other people who are particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p>Periodically, the virus changes substantially or a new strain makes the leap from animal to human. This is widely believed to be the case in the 1957 Asian Flu and the 1968 Hong Kong Flu, both of which were thought to have traveled from bird to swine to human.</p>
<p>By understanding the genetics, particularly of this deadly strain, the team wrote, scientists in the future may be able to understand better how &quot;novel influenza viruses evolve and circulate in humans.&quot;</p>
<p>And they may be able to improve global surveillance of influenza, making them better able to prepare for a pandemic.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no reason this (a 1918-type of flu) couldn't happen again,&quot; said Reid. &quot;With the information we will generate from the 1918 virus, we should be able to make a better call.&quot;</p>
