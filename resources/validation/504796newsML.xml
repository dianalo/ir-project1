<headline>Indonesian tribe says Freeport suit not rejected.</headline>

<p>A close aide to an Indonesian tribal leader said that a U.S. district court had not dismissed a $6 billion lawsuit accusing Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc and Freeport-McMoRan Inc of human rights and environmental abuses in some of its operations.</p>
<p>The companies said on Wednesday that the court had ruled against Tom Beanal, a leader of the Amungme tribe in remote Irian Jaya province, because the suit which was filed by on his behalf by a New Orleans attorney in April had no basis in law. &quot;It's not true that suit has been dismissed. The court only asked the plaintiff to 'sharpen' the suit, especially on the part concerning human rights abuses,&quot; Sylvester, an aide of Beanal, told Reuters from Timika, which is near Freeport's Irian Jaya mining site.</p>
<p>Beanal is the leader of the Amungme Tribal Council and Sylvester is on the staff there. Beanal was out of town when attempts were made to reach him on Friday.</p>
<p>Sylvester said that Beanal's lawyer, Martin Regan, called the group's office from New Orleans and said the court had asked the plaintiffs to improve the suit, but had not rejected it.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know yet when the suit would be returned to the court. What I know is that there was no problem with the part concerning the environment,&quot; he added. He said he had no further details.</p>
<p>Beanal filed the suit claiming that the company's subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia had engaged in &quot;eco-terrorism&quot; and &quot;cultural genocide&quot; at its mine in Irian Jaya on the western half of New Guinea island.</p>
<p>The Freeport mine, some 3,000 km (1,870 miles) east of Jakarta, sits on one of the world's largest known deposits of copper and gold.</p>
<p>The Indonesian mine's operations have been plagued by allegations of wrongdoing after an Australian activist group accused the company of violating the rights of tribal people near the Irian Jaya mine in 1995.</p>
<p>Last year, three people were killed during riots in Timika, which forced the closure of the mine for 2-1/2 days. The riot erupted after a Freeport vehicle hit a local man.</p>
<p>In its release issued in New Orleans on Wednesday, Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold said it planned to continue its work with the local people and the Indonesian government to implement the government's Integrated Timika Development plan to meet the needs of the people in Irian Jaya.</p>
