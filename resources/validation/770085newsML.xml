<title>USA: U.S. economy slowed abruptly in second quarter.</title>

<p>Consumers cut their spending sharply in the spring, helping slow second-quarter economic growth to a rate less than half that posted in the first three months this year, the Commerce Department said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of overall U.S. economic activity, grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, down from a revised 4.9 percent pace in the first quarter.  </p>

<p>Prices rose at the slowest rate in decades, likely further reducing any pressure for interest-rate rises by federal policymakers since inflation was virtually absent.</p>
<p>The department previously reported that GDP shot ahead at a 5.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter. But it trimmed that back to 4.9 percent as part of a broader set of revisions to the national income and product accounts beginning with the first quarter of 1993.</p>
<p>Revisions are made each July to incorporate more complete and accurate data from sources, in this case including updated federal government budget information as well as price changes for semiconductors and computers that have grown cheaper.</p>
<p>The latest GDP report showed growth at the beginning of 1997 was less vigorous than previously thought. That, along with the second-quarter slowing, implies little or no need for interest-rate rises soon to keep inflation in check.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve last raised interest rates in March and has held them steady at two subsequent meetings.</p>
<p>The rate of growth in consumer spending slowed abruptly in the second quarter to a $9.8-billion annual rate from $61.7 billion in the first quarter -- the key reason for the second-quarter slowdown since spending on goods and services fuels two-thirds of national economic activity.</p>
<p>&quot;The smaller increase in real GDP in the second quarter than in the first was more than accounted for by decelerations in personal consumption expenditures for goods and in change in business inventories,&quot; Commerce said.</p>
<p>Businesses added to their inventories at a $66.8 billion annual rate in the second quarter. That was little changed from the $63.7-billion addition to stocks they made in the first quarter when inventories were being built up at a much more rapid rate than late in 1996.</p>
<p>The second-quarter GDP estimate will be revised twice in coming months as the government receives more complete data on the economy's performance. The initial estimate was above Wall Street economists' forecasts that it would advance at a 1.9 percent rate.</p>
<p>An inflation measure in the GDP report pointed to a muted rate of price rises. The implicit price deflator advanced at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter after a 2.4 percent first-quarter rate of increase.</p>
<p>It was the smallest quarterly increase in prices in 33 years, since a 0.9 percent rise in the second quarter of 1964, department officials said.</p>
