<p>The prices of U.S. Treasuries were seen likely to remain in narrow ranges on Friday as market participants had little data to digest.</p>
<p>Housing starts were scheduled for release at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT and analysts polled by Reuters expected that, on average, they would come in at a 1.43 million annualized rate. However, flooding in the Midwest could drop the rate to closer to 1.40 million, some economists cautioned.</p>
<p>At 1000 EDT/1400 GMT the University of Michigan was scheduled to release its consumer confidence survey.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're getting housing starts which are not the most important number, but are not irrelevant either,&quot; said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.</p>
<p>The University of Michigan's survey -- already high -- probably wouldn't rise much further, Moran said, leaving an upward bias to the bond market.</p>
<p>A softer reading on the Philadelphia Fed's survey and weak consumer prices failed to rally the market on Thursday, and Moran said he still expected the Federal Reserve to refrain from further tightening monetary policy at its next meeting on May 20.  </p>
<p>&quot;They (the Fed) should hold steady, but that's not a view I'm highly confident in,&quot; Moran said. &quot;They're affected by the politics of so many from so many different quarters calling for them not to be so aggressive (in hiking short-term interest rates),&quot; Moran said.</p>
<p>Many are arguing that the old rules of economic fundamentals no longer apply, leaving room to allow for further growth, Moran said.</p>
<p>Signs of strong inflationary growth have yet to emerge as seen by non-growing industrial production and weak CPI on Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Housing starts should be the important number of the day. Consensus has them up a fraction,&quot; said John Mueller, senior vice president and chief economist at Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon Inc.</p>
<p>Mueller expected the numbers would be slightly weaker, given the downward revision seen in recent economic indices.</p>
<p>&quot;The evidence is accumulating that the Fed won't have to pull the trigger&quot; and tighten next week, Mueller said.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, most of what the market was likely to see in gains already had been made, he said.  </p>
<p>In late trading Thursday the 30-year bond was up 6/32 at 96-29/32 to yield 6.87 percent.</p>
<p>At the short end the three-month bill was down five basis points at 4.98 percent. The six-month was off one basis point at 5.28 percent and the year bill was down one basis point at 5.50 percent.</p>
<p>Ten-year notes were up 3/32 at 99-24/32 to yield 6.66 percent. Five-year issues were up 2/32 at 100-15/32 to yield 6.51 percent and two-years were up 1/32 at 100-09/32 to yield 6.22 percent.</p>
