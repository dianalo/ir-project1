<p>Unease over Asian currency devaluations is likely to lead to a more prudent Brazilian foreign exchange policy, Brazil's private sector National Industry Confederation (CNI) .</p>
<p>The CNI said in a statement that abrupt changes to policy could only add to uncertainty in the markets and that exchange rates and interest rates were likely to &quot;stay where they are&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has been firm in its comments and convincing in its actions with regard to its commitment to maintain the current foreign exchange policy,&quot; the CNI said.</p>
<p>&quot;Abrupt changes in this area, especially in current economic conditions, would only contribute to raising the level of uncertainty. Therefore, we can expect an even more prudent foreign exchange rate policy,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The CNI said devaluations in Thailand and the Philippines, which have sent ripples of nervousness to other emerging markets, resulting Tuesday in a sharp plunge in Brazilian stock prices, would have a relatively small impact on Brazil.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't however deny that international economic conditions have deteriorated,&quot; it said, citing higher interest rates in Britain, high interest rates in the United States and the possibility of a rate rise in Japan.</p>
<p>It termed &quot;an excess of optimism&quot; the view expressed by some Brazilian government officials that Brazil might benefit from the troubles of its Asian competitors by stealing foreign investment.</p>
<p>The Central Bank's Director of Monetary Policy, Francisco Lopes, said seperately that Brazil's foreign exchange rate system was working.</p>
<p>He said that in the last three months, the real currency had begun to depreciate against the dollar at a slightly faster rate than consumer inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;It's functioning,&quot; Lopes told reporters.</p>
<p>Brazil's foreign exchange rate system consists of two currency bands supported by simultaneous buy-sell operations of the Central Bank.</p>
