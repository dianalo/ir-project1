<headline>UK to raise public sector pay by average 3.3 pct.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The government said on Thursday it would raise the pay of about 1.3 million UK public sector workers by an average 3.3 percent, payable in two stages.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major said in a written parliamentary answer that a first-stage payment of two percent would be made on April 1, with the balance of the recommended increases to be paid from December 1.  </p>
<p>Major said the pay award would meet the government's requirements on affordability, while implementing the increases recommended by the independent pay review bodies in full by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>He said pay setlements had to be consistent with the government's approach to public sector pay.</p>
<p>&quot;Specifically, under this approach, the cost of pay settlements should be met from existing spending plans, without recourse to the Reserve,&quot; Major said.  </p>
<p>Major said the main recommendations, accepted by the government, were as follows:</p>
<p>-- armed forces, 3.4 percent on average.</p>
<p>-- doctors and dentists, 3.4 percent</p>
<p>-- nurses, 3.3 percent.</p>
<p>-- teachers, 3.3 percent.</p>
<p>The senior salaries review body recommended the following increases:</p>
<p>-- a 2.75 percent rise in the minimum and maximum values of each of the pay ranges for the senior civil service, with individual salaries set within the ranges based on performance.  </p>
<p>Major said the government expects the cost of the settlement for mandarins to be offset by savings arising from staff cuts.</p>
<p>-- increases for senior military officers ranging from 2.75 to six percent and averaging 3.7 percent.</p>
<p>-- A restructuring of judicial pay, following a two-year review, with rises ranging from three to seven percent and averaging six percent.</p>
<p>Separately, armed forces personnel covered by the pay review board will get an extra 1.35 percent -- of which one percent is carried forward from last year's review -- as a pensions top-up.  </p>
<p>Major said the average 3.3 percent increase was lower than last year's rise of four percent.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a move in the right direction, but the recommendations are still high considering the general level of public sector pay settlements in the past year, and higher than the Retail Price Index,&quot; the Prime Minister said.</p>
<p>He said that, without staging the increases, it would have been difficult to meet the costs from existing spending plans without squeezing public services.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, staging reflects our view that settlements should be lower this year both generally throughout the public sector and specifically for the pay review body groups,&quot; Major said.</p>
<p>MPs and ministers, whose pay is linked to the ranges of the senior civil service, will be given an increase of two percent on April 1 and the balance on December 1.</p>
