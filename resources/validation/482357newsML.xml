<p>Industrial group Alusuisse-Lonza Holding AG will continue to focus on its core businesses of aluminium, chemicals and packaging, new chief executive officer Sergio Marchionne pledged on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Marchionne, who as a Canadian joins the growing circle of non-Swiss executives taking the helms of big Swiss companies, said the company would continue extensive investments to raise the value added in production.</p>
<p>But Marchionne also said the group would keep an eye open for ways to &quot;stretch&quot; the borders of its businesses in order to boost its know-how.</p>
<p>Talking about building on the group's strengths, he said: &quot;This must be pursued on the one hand by focusing clearly on our core competencies and on the other hand by expanding the borders of our activities by creative stretching.&quot;</p>
<p>Marchionne, who joined Alusuisse in 1994 as chief financial officer, was speaking to an annual shareholder meeting after being elected chief executive by the board to succeed Theodor Tschopp, who advanced to chairman of the board.</p>
<p>Marchionne said investments last year of 700 million Swiss francs in production plants and 600 million in acquiring new packaging businesses showed the group was intent on strengthening its strategic position.</p>
<p>&quot;It also makes clear that we will expand or cross over the traditional borders of industrial activity in cases where we can compliment our expand our know-how through acquisitions or through building greenfield production plants,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1997 the pace of this extensive investment programme will go on unabated,&quot; he said, pointing to plans for 900 million Swiss francs in investments this year.</p>
<p>&quot;It (Alusuisse) intends to fund its 1997 capital requirements from internally generated resources,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Alusuisse's investments last year included buying Wheaton, a U.S. packaging company, and Celltech Biologics Ltd, a biotechnology group, both as add-ons to its packaging division Lawson.</p>
<p>Packaging contributed 36 percent to operating results last year while aluminium added 33 percent and Lonza chemicals produced 31 percent. Net profit in 1996 was up eight percent to 417 million Swiss francs.</p>
<p>Marchionne was one of the key executives who worked out a new strategy since 1994 of concentrating on increasing value by growing divisions with high value-added potential.</p>
<p>Analysts have welcomed Marchionne's appointment, which they see as securing continuity while bringing an international financial perspective to the post.</p>
