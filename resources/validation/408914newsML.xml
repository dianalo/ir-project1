<p>The Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) said on Thursday that broadcasting profit from Australia's 44 free to air television licensees rose eight percent to A$439 million in 1995/96 to June 30.</p>
<p>The ABA said revenue in the same period rose by 4.4 percent to A$2.46 billion while expenses rose by 3.6 percent to A$2.02 billion. It said the number of profitable services went up to 41 from 40 in the 1994/95 year and losses from the three unprofitable services fell by 60 percent to A$2.4 million.  </p>
<p>&quot;The commercial television industry has managed to increase profitability by containing costs during a year of below average revenue growth,&quot; the ABA's acting chairman, Tim O'Keefe, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The 15 mainland state capital city services experienced a five percent rise in total broadcasting revenue to A$1.94 billion in 1995/96 representing 79 percent of industry revenue.</p>
<p>The six Sydney and Melbourne services generated 51 percent of industry advertising revenue.  </p>
<p>The ABA said the 15 licensees in multi-station regional markets increased revenue by 2.3 percent to A$442.3 million, representing 18 percent of industry revenue.</p>
<p>The remaining 14, single service market licensees lifted sales by 4.8 percent to A$79.9 million and the three unprofitable services were in this group.</p>
<p>The commercial television industry spent A$504 million on Australian programming in 1995/96, which was a six percent rise on the previous year, the ABA said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Expenditure on overseas programming decreased by two percent to A$196.5 million, reversing a trend experienced in the previous years,&quot; the authority said.</p>
