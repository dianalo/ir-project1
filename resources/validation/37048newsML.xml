<p>President Aleksander Kwasniewski said on Friday the current row between Poland's two ruling coalition parties would be settled and there would not be early elections.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no crisis,&quot; Kwasniewski told reporters, adding that he had agreed with members of the coalition that it should survive and elections should be held when due in late 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the elections should be held as planned, about a year from today, September 17 or thereabouts -- we need the time,&quot; Kwasniewski said at his palace after meeting Senate speaker Adam Struzik of the Polish Peasant Party (PSL).</p>
<p>&quot;Today, in talks among others with Speaker Struzik, we resolved that the coalition should be maintained, that we must find solutions,&quot; Kwasniewski said.</p>
<p>Some PSL leaders have threatened to quit the coalition and prompt early polls after one the party's ministers was sacked on Wednesday by the prime minister belonging to the larger, ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), which Kwasniewski led before becoming president.</p>
<p>Peasant Party chiefs were meeting on Wednesday to decide conditions for staying in the alliance, likely to include demands for key economic portfolios when ministries are reorganised in a reform of central government due to begin in next month.</p>
<p>Kwasniewski said the coalition should survive because the next year was essential, among other things, to pass a new Polish constitution to replace the current interim charter which was cobbled together to amend the communist-era document.</p>
<p>If the constitution now being drafted was not completed by the elections, the whole process would have to start again and might not be finished by the year 2000, Kwasniewski said.</p>
<p>Kwasniewski said that if, by early 1997, he saw there were problems with passing the constitution, he might submit a bill to set up a special 100 or 50 person body of lawyers and other experts, solely charged with drafting a constitution.</p>
<p>Kwasniewski said the government should also focus over coming years on sustaining high economic growth, especially as this was vital to close the gap separating Poland from Western countries it hopes to join soon within the European Union.</p>
<p>Kwasniewski said government appointments during the coming reform of economic ministries should reflect this priority.</p>
