<p>Cyprus on Tuesday accused Turkey of adopting hardline tactics on the dispute splitting the island in an attempt to force it to abandon U.N.-led peace talks and scupper its European Union entry talks next year.</p>
<p>Government spokesman Manolis Christofides said renewed calls by Ankara for the integration of occupied northern Cyprus was a ploy to force Greek Cypriots to quit negotiations on settling Cyprus's division in the hope that it would prompt the EU to put next year's scheduled start of entry talks with Cyprus on hold.</p>
<p>&quot;The cool-headedness and prudent manner in which Cyprus and Greece handled these unacceptable Turkish provocations made these Turkish aims untenable,&quot; Christofides told reporters.</p>
<p>On Sunday Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who as prime minister ordered the 1974 invasion of Cyprus, called for the integration of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state with Turkey.</p>
<p>Ecevit said integration of the self-declared Turkish Cypriot state was inevitable after the European Union gave a green light last week to Cyprus for membership and excluded Turkey.</p>
<p>Cyprus is due to start membership talks with the EU early next year.</p>
<p>Ankara says allowing Cyprus, run by a Greek Cypriot government that is internationally recognised, to join the EU before the division of the island is resolved would only reinforce the tensions between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.</p>
<p>A Nicosia-based diplomat said Christofides's assertion that Turkey wanted to trip up Cyprus's entry talks with Europe was &quot;probably correct&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a game. On the eve of certain big events in Cyprus one side will always try to make life difficult for the other. It is to prepare for a better negotiating position,&quot; the diplomat said.</p>
<p>Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides held a series of United Nations-sponsored talks with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in upstate New York this month.</p>
<p>The two leaders have tentatively agreed to meet for another round of talks in Switzerland in mid-August. They are also scheduled to meet within the next 10 days in Nicosia to discuss humanitarian issues associated with the Cyprus problem.</p>
<p>The international community has for years been trying to reunite the Mediterranean island as a bicommunal, bizonal federation without result. Although both sides agree with the form of the solution in principle, key differences remain on topics ranging from security to sovereignty.</p>
<p>Turkey invaded  and occupied the northern third of Cyprus on July 20, 1974 in response to a Greek Cypriot coup backed by the military then ruling Greece.</p>
<p>Cyprus has since been divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot sectors. The breakaway Turkish Cypriot state was declared in 1983 but is recognised only by Ankara.</p>
