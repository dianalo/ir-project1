<p>Tour of Spain fans were treated to their first successful breakaway on Wednesday after 11 days of racing as Italy's Marco di Renzo held on through 150 kilometres to take a windy 11th stage.</p>
<p>Alex Zuelle of Switzerland retained the overall race lead, with Spain's Miguel Indurain and Frenchman Laurent Jalabert just over a minute behind in second and third places.</p>
<p>All the earlier stages, apart from Tuesday's time-trial, had ended in mass sprints.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, in the final kilometre, Di Renzo surged ahead of Spaniard Ignacio Garcia Camacho, his partner in a breakaway which had started near the beginning of the 197-km stage.</p>
<p>It was Di Renzo's most important win and just reward after several earlier stages in which he had struggled to lead breakaways in difficult terrain and conditions.</p>
<p>For a time the pack seemed to try to haul in the pair, who stretched their lead to nearly 13 minutes. But they gradually appeared to lose interest in the chase and the gap was still more than eight minutes just 30 kms from the line.</p>
<p>Affected by head and side winds and the movement from rough narrow roads to smoother surfaces, the pack was broken at several stages. But all the chief contenders arrived together, more than 4-1/2 minutes behind in provisional timings.</p>
<p>The Vuelta moves to the Asturian coast for Thursday's 188-km 12th stage between Benavente and the classic mountain finish at Alto del Naranco.</p>
<p>Several riders have decided to pull out, notably Italy's Francesco Casagrande, who rode a bad time-trial on Tuesday and has decided to return home to prepare for the forthcoming world championships.</p>
