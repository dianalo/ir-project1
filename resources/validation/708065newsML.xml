<p>Iberian bonds will stay supported next week and yield spreads against 10-year Bunds should stay in a range between 60 and 70 basis points, analysts said.</p>
<p>Some analysts said at the beginning of the week, longer bonds would continue their recent climb and reach new highs.</p>
<p>But this surge may not continue amid fears Spanish June inflation, due next Friday, could show a slight rise over May.</p>
<p>Dealers said prospects for shorter Portuguese maturities prices were rosier than for Bonos because Portugal's June inflation rate was expected to be favourable, paving the way for further key rate cuts.</p>
<p>The Portuguese government's threat to resign over opposition proposals on local authority spending should have little impact on Portugual's bond prices, dealers said.</p>
<p>Analysts said Portugal was on track to join Europe's single euro currency despite Prime Minister Antonio Guterres' resignation threats on Thursday.</p>
<p>After U.S. Treasuries' rally on Thursday, Portuguese bonds and Bonos prices rose to their highs. The 10-year Portuguese bond yield fell to 6.32 percent as prices jumped and the Spanish equivalent yield was 6.27 percent.</p>
<p>Yield spreads between Bonos and Bunds are 67 basis points and 72 basis points between Portuguese bonds and Bunds. That compares with 68 and 70 basis points, respectively, last Monday.</p>
<p>On June 18, the spread between Bonos and Bunds hit a historic low of 61 basis points. At the end of May, the spread between Portuguese bonds abd Bunds hit a low of 50 basis points.</p>
<p>&quot;Bonos should continue to behave well and to converge (with Bunds). There was no profit taking this week, and I don't think there will be any next week,&quot; said Giovanni Polastri, analyst of 4Cast in London.</p>
<p>Nuno Godinho, analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said &quot;if the core countries correct from the present high levels, peripherals will fall less. And this favours a tightening of spreads (between Iberian bonds and Bunds.)&quot;</p>
<p>Valentin Fernandez, analyst at Credit Lyonnais in Madrid, said yield spreads between Bonos and Bunds could drop to 60 basis points early next week. But later in the week, expectations of a higher Spanish inflation rate in June could push up spreads to between 70 and 72 basis points.</p>
<p>&quot;We could see Spanish June (year-on-year) inflation of 1.6 to 1.7 percent, and this could spark a correction. At present levels, I would prefer to invest in U.S. Treasuries,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Though Spain's 1.5-percent May year-on-year inflation was the lowest in 30 years, some analysts said accelerating economic growth and wage inflation could delay a cut in the 5.25-percent repo rate until the end of the summer.</p>
<p>In contrast, Portuguese inflation is seen falling from May's disappointing 0.7 percent, due to exceptional factors like pork and potato price rises.</p>
<p>&quot;A more favourable inflation result in June in Portugal and improved possibilities for Portuguese rate cuts should mean that shorter Portuguese bonds will perform better than Bonos,&quot; Fernandez said.</p>
<p>Analysts consider Portugal's 6.00-percent repo rate and 5.7-percent draining rate too high when accounting for Portugal's fundamentals versus Spain's.</p>
<p>&quot;The wide spreads between Portuguese bonds and Bonos are not justified and will converge quickly towards zero,&quot; said Godinho.</p>
<p>March 1999 Portuguese bonds have a yield of 5.27 percent, 30 basis points above April 1999 Bonos.</p>
