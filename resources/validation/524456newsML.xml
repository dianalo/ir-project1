<p>The leader of a bloody army coup attempt that shook Venezuela's democracy five years ago announced on Monday he would run for the presidency next year.</p>
<p>Retired Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, head of the small, left-leaning Boliviariano Revolutionary Movement (MBR-200), said he had &quot;the firm intention of emerging a winner&quot; of the December 1998 election.</p>
<p>&quot;When a soldier goes to battle he wants to win not to lose, and I intend to be Venezuela's Commander in Chief,&quot; he told a news conference. He said an opinion poll his movement conducted in 15 cities showed 50 percent of the people were ready to vote for him.</p>
<p>Chavez led a failed rebellon on Feb. 4, 1992, and was jailed for two years until President Rafael Caldera pardoned the rebellious officers shortly after assuming power.</p>
<p>Chavez became the first political leader to proclaim his presidential candidacy officially. Former beauty queen Irene Saez, Venezuela's most popular politician, has hinted she will also run.</p>
<p>Political analysts say MBR-200 is no serious political threat but his populist message laced with leftist rhetoric is effective among the poor.</p>
