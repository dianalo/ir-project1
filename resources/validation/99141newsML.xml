<p>Luis Giusti, head of state monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela SA, said he doubts Venezuela can come up with much heating oil to help U.S. consumers from paying too much for heating oil this winter.</p>
<p>&quot;Our refiners are pretty much running full out,&quot; PDVSA chief executive officer Luis Giusti told Reuters.</p>
<p>Last week, U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said price spikes in the U.S. this winter might be averted by attracting supplies from Venezuela.</p>
<p>On a visit to New York, Giusti noted that the tightness in heating oil markets that O'Leary was addressing is due in large part to delays in implementation of the United Nations/Iraq oil-for-food deal, under which Iraq is allowed to sell about 700,000 barrel per day of crude over six months, on a renewable basis, to fund humanitarian relief.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody was expecting the oil-for-food deal and it didn't happen. So what happened was that everyone was caught with low stocks when demand was increasing,&quot; Guisti said.</p>
<p>Giusti has previously said Venezuelan heating oil exports are now at about 100,000 barrels per day, and are unlikely to be raised despite the high U.S. demand.</p>
