<title>NIGERIA: At least 291 striking Nigerian academics resign.</title>
<headline>At least 291 striking Nigerian academics resign.</headline>
<dateline>LAGOS 1996-09-11</dateline>

<p>At least 291 academics from a banned union resigned from their jobs at a Nigerian university on Wednesday, while others across the country gave up a five month strike and returned to work.</p>
<p>Nigeria's military government last week gave the lecturers a seven-day ultimatum to resume classes by Tuesday or quit.</p>
<p>A statement from the 291 lecturers at the University of Ilorin, in the opposition's southwestern heartland, said they were resigning because of &quot;the unwillingness of the government to amicably resolve the dispute between the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and the government through dialogue.&quot;</p>
<p>But reports from many of Nigeria's 37 other universities said staff had returned to work and begun teaching classes for the tens of thousands of students left idle for five months.</p>
<p>In Lagos, lecturers have begun teaching in law, philosophy and some other faculties, while others remain on strike.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still waiting for instructions from our union before we will know what the next line of action is,&quot; said Segun Odukomaya, a lecturer of mass communication in Lagos who had returned to work.</p>
<p>Lecturers in Nigeria's universities have been on strike since April, pressing for better working conditions.</p>
<p>The government last month banned ASUU and two smaller academic unions because of the strike.</p>
<p>Witnesses said police were deployed in heavy numbers around the campus of Lagos University on Wednesday, but there were no reports of violence.</p>
<p>Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, sank into political crisis in 1993, when a previous military government annulled a presidential election meant to restore democracy after a decade of army rule.</p>
<p>Students were in the forefront of violent protests against the poll's annulment in 1993 and against the detention of the presumed winner, Moshood Abiola, in 1994.</p>
