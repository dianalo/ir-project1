<p>Gaming machine maker Aristocrat Leisure Ltd said on Friday that it disagreed with a critical interim ruling by the Colorado Gaming Control Commission and would conduct a challenge at a full hearing late next month.</p>
<p>Aristoctat general counsel Louise Sexton said she would not details the concerns which led to the latest ruling.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not going to elaborate on them because we actually don't believe they are valid,&quot; Sexton told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of them are mistakes of facts and so we are not going to be talking about those.&quot;  </p>
<p>The company said in a statement, issued after the close of local share market trading, that the Commission had issued a &quot;notice of denial&quot; for the renewal of its manufacturing and distributors licence in the Rocky Mountains state.</p>
<p>Sexton said Colorado accounted for less than five percent of the company's U.S. market but could have flow-on effects.</p>
<p>&quot;It could have. Obviously all regulators talk to each other,&quot; she said, adding that nothing was likely to happen in other states until the Commission hearings had ended and a final ruling was issued.</p>
<p>The hearings are set for August 28, 29 and September 5.  </p>
<p>Sexton said she did not expect the Colorado interim ruling to have any impact on the company's plans to apply for a licence in the key gaming state of Nevada (Reno, Las Vegas) later in calendar 1997.</p>
<p>Aristocrat Leisure has a gaming licence in New Jersey (Atlantic City) and this licence had been reviewed without investigation over the last three years. She said this licence was due for review sometime in the future with no date set.</p>
<p>Aristocrat, which makes poker or &quot;slot&quot; machines for casinos and licenced clubs and hotels, assembles its product in California.  </p>
