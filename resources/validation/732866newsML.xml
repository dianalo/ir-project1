<p>The Spanish government is tightening the screws on the Basque guerrilla group ETA, barring demonstrations by its supporters and proposing new legal restrictions in retaliation for the killing of a politician.</p>
<p>The Basque government, with enthusiastic support from Madrid, blocked protest rallies planned for Saturday and Sunday by ETA's political wing, Herri Batasuna, for fear it would ignite more violence in the troubled region.</p>
<p>Basque politicial leaders and the central government in Madrid have vowed to isolate Herri Batasuna because it did not condemn the abduction and killing of Miguel Angel Blanco, a 29-year-old Basque town councillor.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government has promised a crackdown on the separatist rebels and is formulating tougher legislation to combat terrorism.</p>
<p>&quot;There are legal steps we must take (against ETA),&quot; Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja told reporters on Wednesday. &quot;We will be steadfast in applying those measures.&quot;</p>
<p>Spaniards, outraged at the attack on such an ordinary low-level functionary, mounted huge street protests against ETA. The government estimates that six million people have demonstrated across the country since Blanco's death on Sunday.</p>
<p>Though almost all the gatherings were peaceful, scattered clashes have erupted between ETA supporters and opponents around the Basque country. There have also been a number of attempts to burn Herri Batasuna offices.</p>
<p>Basques were once intimidated by the radical separatists but have become newly emboldened by the nationwide condemnation.</p>
<p>The clashes of the past few days have raised fears of a more widespread civil confrontation.</p>
<p>Herri Batasuna demonstrations have turned into violent confrontations with police in the past. But now there is also concern about sectarian violence.</p>
<p>A Herri Batasuna spokesman said he did not know if the group would go ahead with the demonstration despite the ban. But ETA has already shown its defiance of the public pressure by threatening a second Basque town councillor with death.</p>
<p>Aznar told the leadership of his Popular Party on Tuesday that he sees the street demonstrations as a call for government action.</p>
<p>However, too tough a crackdown could play into the hands of ETA by generating public sympathy for its claims that the government is authoritarian and violates human rights.</p>
<p>ETA began its armed campaign for an independent state in 1968 under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco who repressed any expression of Basque nationalism.</p>
<p>Support for the group has waned since Franco's death in 1975 and the subsequent transition to democracy which eventually gave the Basque region a high degree of autonomy. The rebels have killed more than 800 people in their 29-year struggle.</p>
<p>The reforms, which must be approved by parliament, include criminalising demonstrations by activists who mask their faces and banning counter-demonstrations against pacifist groups.</p>
<p>The government also wants to increase the jail terms for threats or any action construed as &quot;defence of terrorism&quot;.</p>
<p>While pressure grew from the outside, a rift within the radical camp was deepening. A growing number of ETA prisoners and Herri Batasuna members are speaking out against the killing and questioning the wisdom of continued armed struggle.</p>
<p>The criticism from within may signal ETA is becoming more divided than ever and possibly heading for a split, political analysts said. ETA, they said, is losing politican influence among Basques.</p>
