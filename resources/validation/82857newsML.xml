<p>Burmese police blocked the main road leading to the residence of democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Friday where her National League for Democracy had planned to hold a congress, witnesses said.  </p>
<p>&quot;They are trying to prevent our congress from taking place,&quot; said an NLD party member, who was standing near a roadblock erected along University Avenue where Suu Kyi's house is located. Police refused to let people or vehicles gather in the vicinity of her home, witnesses added.</p>
<p>NLD party sources told Reuters they had heard that police planned to prevent anyone from gathering near Suu Kyi's home where a congress of about 200 of the NLD's key members had been planned from Friday to Sunday.</p>
<p>A plan to hold a similar gathering in May spurred the arrest of some 260 democracy activists by the military government. They were later released.</p>
<p>So far no arrests of NLD supporters had been reported, NLD sources said. The scene at Suu Kyi's house was quiet with nobody gathering outside her home, although some NLD members were inside, witnesses added.</p>
