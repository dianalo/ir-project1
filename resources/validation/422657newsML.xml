<p>Pakistan is unlikely to achieve tough IMF-set economic targets in fiscal 1996/97 (July-June) but hopes the lending agency will be lenient with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's new government, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>An International Monetary Fund mission was due in Islamabad on Wednesday to start a two-week review of Pakistan's efforts to meet the terms of an IMF standby loan.</p>
<p>&quot;In my view there is a 70 percent chance that Nawaz Sharif will not fall out with the IMF,&quot; Jahanzeb Naseer, research head at Jardine Fleming Pakistan, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the IMF had given Pakistan a lot of leeway in the past despite several slippages and he hoped it would give Sharif's government, elected on February 3, some breathing space.</p>
<p>The IMF resumed the standby loan in December after a caretaker government promised to cut the budget deficit to four percent of gross domestic product this year from 6.3 percent in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Kalim Aziz, research head at ING Barings, said the government may not be able to achieve the four percent target, but said the IMF might reward Sharif's team for a good-faith effort.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the short span of time the new government has had, and the improvement in performance, we do not think that the fund is likely to punish Pakistan for trying,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sharif and Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz have said they doubt whether the four percent target can be met by the end of June, but have promised to abide by commitments to the IMF.</p>
<p>If the review team is satisfied, the IMF will release the next $122 million tranche of the standby loan in what would be an important signal that Pakistan is cooperating.</p>
<p>&quot;Both sides have an interest in seeing some deal emerge,&quot; said one international banker, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Some analysts believe Sharif's emphasis on stimulating growth and reviving industry may run afoul of IMF prescriptions aimed at bringing the fiscal deficit under control.</p>
<p>A report by ING Baring Securities this week said Pakistan faced a &quot;very high probability of default&quot; in the second half of 1997, when some $3 billion was needed for external obligations.</p>
<p>A report by Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia last week said default was a &quot;90 percent probability&quot;.</p>
<p>Naseer, however, said such talk was over-blown.</p>
<p>&quot;The risk has always been there but Pakistan has managed to avoid it in the past and will be able to do so again,&quot; he said, citing its escape from an even worse currency crisis in September.</p>
