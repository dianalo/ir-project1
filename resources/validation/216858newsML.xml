<text>
<p>Investors bailed out of South African gold shares on Tuesday as the bullion price continued weak shaving nearly three percent off the index and taking it to its lowest closing level in 10 months.</p>
<p>But industrial shares were boosted by futures-related trade although dealers said were it not for this activity, the index would have ended flat on a lack of fresh factors.</p>
<p>Anglo results helped to lift sentiment in the afternoon following the release of half year results stronger than analysts' forecasts.</p>
<p>The stronger rand also helped gains in industrials, dealers said.</p>
<p>The gold index ended down 48.4 points, or 2.99 percent, to 1,572.9 - its lowest since January 19 this year. The industrial index added 60.3 points to 8,015.4 points and the all-share index was up 30 points to 6,721.3 points.</p>
