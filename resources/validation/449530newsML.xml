<p>The government of Saskatchewan will go back to the drawing board on how to tender its Wascana Energy Inc shares now that a rival offer has been mounted, the minister in charge of the province's investments said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd on Tuesday launched a C$2-billion friendly cash bid for Wascana which eclipsed Talisman Energy Inc's C$1.7-billion cash and stock proposal.  </p>
<p>&quot;The options of whether or not to sell and whether to sell at this offer are opened up again for the bidding period,&quot; Berny Weins, Saskatchewan's Minister of Crown Investments Corp, said in a phone interview from Regina.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll be asking my advisers to monitor the developments around this bid and see whether there may be others or counterproposals and when decision time comes I'll be asking for a recommendation.&quot;</p>
<p>Saskatchewan owns about 7.3 percent of Wascana's shares.  </p>
<p>Weins said his officials had yet to make a decision on whether the government would prefer to sell their holdings in Wascana for cash or shares, but there were no government policies that sought to eliminate investments in publicly traded enterprises.</p>
<p>He also said CanOxy's proposal, like Talisman's, appeared to meet the stipulations of the Wascana Energy Act, legislation that required the company's head office to remain in Regina and employment levels in the province to be maintained.</p>
<p>CanOxy, which has offered C$20.50 per share, said Wascana would become a wholly owned subsidiary and remain headquartered in the Saskatchewan capital.</p>
<p>Wascana would also manage all the western Canadian oil and gas assets of combined entity under the plan, it said.</p>
