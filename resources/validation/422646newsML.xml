<title>THAILAND: Thai bank officials suspended for bungled case.</title>

<p>Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh on Wednesday suspended three senior central bank officials, including a deputy governor, in connection with the failure to bring former executives of ailing Bangkok Bank of Commerce Plc to court.</p>
<p>Government spokesman Varathep Ratanakorn told reporters that suspended deputy governor Jarong Nookhwun and two central bank officers would also face disciplinary reviews.  </p>
<p>Prosecutors said last month they were forced to drop a government case against some Bangkok Bank executives on charges related to Banking Act violations because a one-year statute of limitations had expired.</p>
<p>Former Bangkok Bank of Commerce chief executive Krirkkiat Jaleechan and two aides had been charged with alleged banking act violations and separate offences, including embezzlement of bank funds after the government took over the bank in May last year to save it from a heavy public run on its deposits.</p>
<p>Varathep said two other police officers handling the bungled civil case would also face disciplinary enquiries. He said a government panel ruled that the senior central bank officials could not claim ignorance of the statute of limitations on the case and they should have exercised greater vigilance in pursuing it.</p>
<p>The spokesman said reviews of the five suspended officials would be completed in one month.</p>
