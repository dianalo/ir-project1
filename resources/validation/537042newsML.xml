<title>UK: London gold carves small gains, propped up by $340.</title>
<headline>London gold carves small gains, propped up by $340.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>London precious metal prices were expected to wobble on Thursday, but gold's support at $340.00 an ounce became stronger, paving the way for slight gains, traders said.</p>
<p>Gold moved higher after early buying interest emerged from London-based dealing houses between the $340 and $341 levels. Spot bullion fixed at $341.15, just above Wednesday's $341.00.</p>
<p>Dealers might have been tempted to protect call options accumulated around the $340.00 strike before Monday's OTC expiry, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably we're looking up first, rather than down,&quot; said a London dealer adding that a small hike towards $342.00 could be expected today.</p>
<p>But activity was generally dampened by holidays, with the Jewish Passover all this week, while a week-long Moslem holiday has just finished.</p>
<p>Platinum and palladium moved sideways with no fresh news on delayed Russian platinum group metals (PGM) shipments.</p>
<p>But forward markets bubbled with good borrowing interest for short dates. That squeezed the lease rates, especially for one month.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of it is because nobody has got the liquidity so people are trading forwards rather than trading on the spots,&quot; said the London dealer.</p>
<p>One-month platinum lease jumped to 12.5 percent from around 10 while palladium was available at a steep 14 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>The prospect of continued delays in PGM shipments from Russia, the world's biggest producer, is buoying the market, but the bubble is expected to burst once talks with Japan resume.</p>
<p>Moscow has yet to set the date to begin talks.</p>
<p>Gold is seen hovering above $340, at least until the options expiry, but upside progress will be limited by stiff resistance at $342.50. A test of last week's lows of $337.50 is also not ruled out in the coming days.</p>
<p>&quot;People are trying to search for a bottom but we are going to manage to hold above the $340 support,&quot; said Magid Khoury, chief precious metals dealer at the Swiss-based Socofinance.</p>
<p>Silver moved in a thin range above $4.70, at $4.71/$4.73.</p>
<p>&quot;People are still short. That's why we are not going lower than $4.70-$4.68,&quot; said Khoury of Socofinance, adding that failure in New York to pierce $4.68 proved strong support there.</p>
