<p>Scientists in Iceland warned on Monday that massive flooding was imminent from a gigantic lake of glacier water, melted by a volcano erupting under Europe's largest glacier.</p>
<p>The eruption, which burst through the Vatnajokul glacier in the island's southeast five days ago, is rapidly melting glacial ice with radar measurements indicating water levels in the subglacial Grimsvotn lake are rising 10 metres (33 feet) a day, putting increasing pressure on the icecap.</p>
<p>Magnus Tumi Gudmundsson, head of aerial monitoring and geophysicist at the University of Iceland, said strong winds, snow blizzards and thick cloud were hampering monitoring but flooding was expected soon.</p>
<p>&quot;It can't be very long. I would expect it to happen any moment now,&quot; Gudmundsson told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;But we haven't been able to make any precise measurement of the water level in the lake for two days so there is uncertainty when the ice dam will be physically lifted.&quot;</p>
<p>Since the volcano burst through the remote Vatnajokul glacier last Wednesday, the volcano has spewed out a towering column up to six km (20,000 feet) high of smoke and gas.</p>
<p>Although the activity is in a largely uninhabited area of the barren North Atlantic island, ash from the eruption began settling in villages in the north and east of the country on Sunday and was continuing on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't see very much today but we could see that at the surface the eruption was going at the same rate, although we don't have any information about what is going on under the glacier,&quot; Gudmundsson said.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is no reason to believe the rate has been drastically changed.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the spread of ash in the surrounding countryside was no indication of the extent of the volanic eruption as much of the debris was contained under the ice.</p>
<p>&quot;But in terms of volume of magma or molten rock brought to the base of the glacier, it has been a substantial eruption,&quot; Gudmundsson said.</p>
<p>The erupting volcano is one of about six buried under the ice at the Vatnajokul glacier, located some 400 km (250 miles) east of the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik. The glacier stretches over 8,300 square kms (3,200 sq miles) and is separated from the coast by a fringe of farmland.</p>
<p>But Icelandic meteorologists said despite earlier concerns, the other volcanoes were quiet.</p>
<p>On Monday and over the weekend a steady stream of trucks travelled across the deserted roads towards Skaftafell with loads of rocks to reinforce dykes in the area.</p>
<p>Engineers braved freezing temperatures, driving rain and gale-force winds to try to detect the first signs that vast quantities of water were about to burst from the sub-glacial lake filled to the brim by the eruption.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like giving birth to a child. You know it's coming, but not when,&quot; said Einer Haflidasson, chief engineer for the Icelandic Public Roads Administration.</p>
<p>Scientists estimated that the torrents would reach a maximum speed of between 10 and 25 metres (yards) per second once the lake finally bursts through the icecap.</p>
