<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Wednesday were seen $0.50 per cwt lower amid weak pork demand and sufficient hog supplies, livestock dealers and packer buyers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We got all the hogs we needed today,&quot; one Indiana dealer said.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa/southern Minnesota top prices for hogs delivered to plants were seen at $56.00, with Illinois tops at plants projected at $55.50, sources in those areas said.</p>
<p>Indiana/Ohio top prices for delivered hogs was seen at $56.00, dealers there said.  </p>
<p>Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hog receipts Monday were 116,000 head, compared with an estimate of 110,000, USDA reported. Receipts Tuesday were estimated at 115,000 head.</p>
<p>Large hog marketings started to weigh on pork prices in the absence of aggressive demand, market sources said.</p>
<p>Fresh loins at midday were quoted weak, hams were steady to $1.00 per cwt lower, bellies were steady to $2.00 lower and lean trimmings were $2.00 to $3.00 lower in slow to moderate trading, USDA said in its central U.S. carlot pork report.</p>
<p>There were 33.0 loads of pork and 17.0 loads of trimmed and processed pork sold.</p>
