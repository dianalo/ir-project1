<p>Malawi commercial banks have cut their lending rates by an average eight percentage points to 29 percent from 37 percent as a result of lower inflation which is expected to fall to single digits by year-end.</p>
<p>The banks also lowered their deposit rates by 10 percentage points to 13 percent.</p>
<p>Reserve Bank Governor Matthews Chikaonda said on Tuesday banks had dropped their lending rates ahead of an anticipated fall in inflation to eight percent in December.</p>
<p>&quot;For the first nine months of the year, the inflation rate has been almost zero. Inflation is coming down (and) as inflation comes down, so do interest rates,&quot; Chikaonda told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Monthly inflation was running at 21.5 percent year-on-year in September -- the latest data available -- compared with August's 30.5 per cent.</p>
<p>He said that the country's economy had been turned around, the Kwacha currency had stabilised at 15 kwacha to the dollar and the inflation continued to slump.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rates in Malawi are liberalised. The commercial banks have to make a business decision,&quot; Chikaonda added.</p>
<p>Fred Kanjo, head of economic services at Commercial Bank of Malawi, said the banks had cut their deposit rates in order not to attract too many depositors.</p>
<p>&quot;If we keep our deposit rates high, people will come to us. We don't want to be flooded with too many depositors,&quot; Kanjo said.</p>
<p>The cuts in interest rates are effective November 1.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank cut its lending rates by 10 percentage points to 35 percent in September following a five percentage point cut in June.</p>
