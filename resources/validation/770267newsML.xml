<p>CSCE cocoa futures were called to open $5 lower Thursday, in line with losses in London overnight, traders said.</p>
<p>LIFFE cocoa futures were mainly weaker in thin trade Thursday as the market consolidated recent gains. At the midday break, September was unchanged at 1,024 stg, traded 1,028 to 1,021 stg. December shed six stg to 1,054 stg.</p>
<p>Wednesday, New York cocoa futures rallied to 1-1/2 week highs, bolstered by speculative buying. September settled up $28 at $1,538 a tonne after ranging between $1,550 and $1,500. Second-month December closed $26 higher at $1,585, while the back months also finished up $24.</p>
<p>Technically, traders said September faced some support at $1,535 and then $1,510. Resistance was seen at yesterday's high of $1,550, followed by a chart gap between $1,561 and $1,570.</p>
<p>On the fundamental side, the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) raised this season's cocoa deficit to 134,000 tonnes from its earlier estimate of 115,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>The ICCO said the higher cocoa deficit estimate reflected a 20,000-tonne cut in its crop forecast to 2.695 million tonnes. There was basically no change in the grinding estimate of 2.80 million.</p>
