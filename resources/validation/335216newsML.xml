<headline>OPINION-WEEKLY TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF BOMBAY SHARE INDEX.</headline>
<text>
<p>PYRAMID AT THE DECLINE, AS THE MINOR CORRECTION MAY</p>
<p>LOSE MOMENTUM AT 3334-3265 ... is a trend analysis of the 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index for the period January 27 to January 31 by analyst Mehmood Khan at Times Guaranty Financials Ltd.</p>
<p>								 -----oOo-----</p>
<p>Trading for the week ended on a steady note, with a gain of 13.27 points (0.39 percent) at 3435.62 levels over the previous week, with an intra-week high of 3478.63. A majority of the pivotals tracked after Friday's closing shows that the rise on Friday has been on declining volume, exhibiting that the minor rally from 3342.89 may sustain at best till Tuesday.</p>
<p>The trend following oscillators fail to confirm the sustainability of the minor trend, the intermediate trend which has been classified to be up, will become healthy with the correction that may last for three trading days. After the formation of the minor bottom at 3334-3265 (31 January, 1997), the Sensex may set triggers for the pre-budget rally. This pre-budget swing may lose momentum at 3570-3650 levels.</p>
<p>The cycle theory depicts the Change in trend (CIT) is due and may occur on 27/28 January 1997. The mechanical oscillators in conjunction with the volume justify that the top may be formed at 3465-3487. As per the time cycle theory, the Sensex may move into the CIT, time window on Monday. Hopefully, an upday is formed on Monday. An upday is said to be formed when the Sensex makes a higher high and a higher low with respect to the previous day's range of movement.</p>
<p>An upday formation on Monday would result in a clear three days trend running into the time zone. And if this were to happen then a minor top formation cannot be ruled out. The time cluster logic support the CIT date. The greater the number of clusters terminating on the CIT, date more powerful the turn date becomes. The present CIT, date enjoys seven clusters. Anything above eight clusters is considered high.</p>
<p>The price following oscillators on the weekly bar chart are exhibiting that the top may be formed at 3465-3487 levels - Relative Strength Index (14 RSI) is 56.85, Price Rate of Change (12 ROC) is placed at -5.69, short term stochastic is hovering at 70.37 and its trigger line is at 74.23, while the medium term stochastic is 73.09 and the trigger is 63.31, the Macd is -31.01 and its trigger is -91.74, the price oscillator is 4.03 and the 14 William's percent R is placed at -34.27.</p>
<p>For the current week, the BSE Sensex in the upmove may encounter resistance at 3465, 3485 and 3510 levels, on the lower end it may find support at 3334, 3279 and at the 200 weeks' average at 3203.78 level. The National Index may witness profit booking at 1526-1549 level and support at 1480 and 1439 level.</p>
