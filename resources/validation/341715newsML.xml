<headline>Philip Morris net up as tobacco, food businesses thrive.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Philip Morris Cos Inc., the maker of Marlboro cigarettes and Miller beer, Wednesday reported robust fourth-quarter profits and said it set several records in 1996 as its worldwide tobacco and food businesses thrived.</p>
<p>Profits rose about 16 percent to $1.47 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $1.27 million in the year-ago period. Earnings per share rose to $1.81 from $1.53, beating analysts' estimates of $1.80.</p>
<p>Revenues rose to $16.7 billion from $15.6 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;We are beginning 1997 in great shape, and while the strength of the dollar is a factor that we have to contend with, our prospects remain robust,&quot; Chairman Geoffrey Bible said in a statement.</p>
<p>The New York-based company's other cigarette brands include Merit and Virginia Slims. The company's food brands include Kraft and Oscar Mayer and products such as Kool-Aid and Jell-O.</p>
<p>Full-year profits jumped 15 percent to $6.3 billion, or $7.68 a share, from $5.5 billion, or $6.48 a share, in 1995. Revenues rose to $68.94 billion from $63.77 billion, excluding North American food businesses divested since the beginning of 1995.</p>
<p>Philip Morris U.S.A., the company's U.S. tobacco business, said its earnings rose 12.5 percent to $4.2 billion in 1996. Improvements were driven by higher volume and a shift in sales to more profitable premium brands and pricing, it said.</p>
<p>In the United States, Philip Morris shipped a record 230.8 billion cigarettes in 1996. Marlboro, the company's flagship brand, also set records for volume and shipment share, while capturing 33.3 percent of the retail market, an all-time high.</p>
<p>Philip Morris International, its international tobacco operations, saw operating income rise 18.1 percent in 1996 to $4.1 billion from 1995. The company sold a record volume of 660 billion cigarettes, up 11.3 percent from 1995.</p>
<p>Worldwide volume sales for Marlboro, the world's best-selling cigarette, grew by 8.7 percent to 458 billion cigarettes, a record.</p>
<p>North American food posted record volume growth of 4.5 percent, and income rose 8.5 percent to $2.6 billion, Philip Morris said.</p>
<p>Worldwide food continued its solid growth, with operating income rising 8 percent to $3.9 billion due to volume gains, improved margins, continued cost reductions and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Overall volume sales rose partly due to strong coffee sales and the acquisition of Lacta, Brazil's leading chocolate company.</p>
<p>Miller Brewing's income fell 1.3 percent on lower volume. Miller Lite shipments and retail sales improved, and the business launched new initiatives to reinvigorate its core brands, Philip Morris said.</p>
<p>Philip Morris' stock rose $1 to $115.375 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading.</p>
