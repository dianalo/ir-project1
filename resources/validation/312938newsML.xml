<p>London white sugar futures got off to a slow start as the benchmark March contract drifted higher and away from support at $300, traders said on Thursday. By 1255 GMT volume had amounted to a light 125 lots, predominantly in March. &quot;There's a little bit of buying around this morning but the voluem is pretty thin, there's nothing really going on,&quot; said one trader. March was $1.20 higher at an intraday high of $302.40 and May up 20 cents at $301.10.</p>
<p>Traders said the white premium could be a focus of interest when the raws market opened, as March/March has narrowed to around $67 from $69 earlier this week.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have thought that longer-term the premium does feel like it is going to narrow, if anything,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>&quot;But it hasn't happened yet and it will probably be the last week or so (before expiry),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Some traders have said the premium could fall to $60 before the March whites goes off the board on February 13.</p>
<p>Results are still awaited in Libya's buying tender while Turkey is expected to decide on its 50,000-tonne export tender after 1300 GMT on Friday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Indonesia said it would import around 500,000 tonnes of sugar in 1997 and a strike by Colombian dock workers at the Pacific port of Buenaventura has halted sugar exports.</p>
<p>Trading was extremely thin on the Paris market where only 27 lots of the spot March contract were posted. The position stood $1.10 higher at $302.10.</p>
