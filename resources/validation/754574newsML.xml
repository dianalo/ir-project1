<p>COFFEE: World market for July 23, 2997</p>
<p>Robusta futures in London were knocked down by local selling towards the close but the market still finished the day higher. Benchmark September finished $55 higher at $1,560 per tonnes after a high of $1,575. The gains were sustained in the afternoon by advancing New York arabica futures.</p>
<p>Arabicas jumped sharply in New York for the second day in a row as speculators continued to buy heavily in anticipation of a shortage of exchange-certified coffee for delivery against the September contract, dealers said. A late session rush of buying drove September thorough key chart resistance at 178 cents/lb, triggering buy stops and propelling the spot contract to an intraday peak of 184.50 cents/lb, its highest level in three weeks.</p>
<p>By the close, September stood at 181.65 cents, up 12.55 on the day. Second position December closed at 158.15 cents/lb, up 6.40 cents. The outer months closed 1.75 to 4.25 cents/lb higher. The September/December switch ballooned to 23.50 cents/lb, compared with 17.35 cents at the close on Monday. Technically, traders said September would face some resistance at today's high of 184.50 cents/lb with many market participants eyeing the 190 cent level.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>UNITED STATES - CSCE coffee stocks rose by 3,666 bags as of July 22. The total now stands at 90,897 bags. There were 5,609 bags pending grading, the CSCE added.</p>
<p>ECUADOR - Ecuador is likely to reduce its requested export quota with the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) by about 100,000 bags for the 1997/987 cycle. A dry spell during January and February followed by recent rains could hurt production and have Ecuador dropping its export quota from this year's 1.3 million bags to 1.2 million for 1997/98.</p>
<p>During the first half of this year Ecuador's coffee exports were down 43.33 percent compared to the year ago period, the ANECAFE reported. From January to June, Ecuador exported 179,844 bags of coffee compared to the 317,357 bags during the same period in 1997.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Coffee imports in May 1997 amounted to 11,914 60-kg bags, which brought cumulative imports bin January/May 19976 to 82,035 bags compared with 72,967 bags in the like period the pervious year. Total imports in 1996 reached 174,221 bags compared with 156,427 bags in 1995. Major countries of origin in 1997 were South Korea with 9,100 bags solubles compared with 7,100 bags and Indonesia with 8,600 bags of green coffee, up from 4,900 bags.</p>
