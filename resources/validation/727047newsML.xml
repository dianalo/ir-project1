<p>Britain will continue to enjoy one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, helped by a strong domestic economy and a flexible labour market, economists in a Reuters survey said on Monday.</p>
<p>The average of predictions from 26 economists showed unemployment declining to as low as 5.1 percent by the end of 1998 from May's 5.8 percent.</p>
<p>Nine of the 27 economists who gave numbers for unemployment saw the rate dipping below five percent at some point in 1998, with the vast part of the increase coming from service sector employment.</p>
<p>&quot;The domestic economy is roaring away. With the service sector bulletting ahead, that's where all employment growth will come from,&quot; said David Bloom, UK economist at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>Although growth is predicted to slow in the long-term, the adverse effect on jobs may not be felt immediately. Instead, the period of above trend growth over the next two quarters will help get still more people out of the dole queue and into work.</p>
<p>&quot;Any growth over trend causes a fairly strong knock-on in employment, particularly given the flexibility of the (labour) market,&quot; said Stuart Wetherby, UK economist at Panmure Gordon.</p>
<p>Richard Jeffrey, group economist at Charterhouse said &quot;if you've got a domestic economy growing by 3.5 to four percent per annum, it is going to be very good for getting unemployment down.&quot;</p>
<p>He forecasts unemployment at just 3.4 percent in the final quarter of 1998 and an average of 3.8 percent over the whole year.</p>
<p>The much-vaunted flexibility in Britain, where many workers are employed on temporary or short-term contracts, has put the country's unemployment rate well below the European Union's average, which was 10.8 percent in May.</p>
<p>But some economists reckoned unemployment had hits its natural level and was more likely to climb.</p>
<p>&quot;You still need a decent amount of growth to get unemployment to continue falling,&quot; said Mark Ramsden, economist at Stone and McCarthy Research.</p>
<p>&quot;If the (Bank of England's) monetary policy committee tries to keep growth below trend, then you'll no longer see employment fall at the same rate and it may even start to pick up slightly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bloom said he doubted the figures and the true rate could be up to a percentage point higher than official figures because people claiming disability living allowances would not be classified as officially unemployed.</p>
<p>&quot;The unemployment rate must be taken with a pinch of salt because there are so many people falling out of the labour force,&quot; he said.</p>
