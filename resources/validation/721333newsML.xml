<p>Following are some of the leading stories in the Swedish papers on Thursday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>DAGENS NYHETER</p>
<p>- Children of unemployed parents should be able to continue going to day-care and free lunches should still be served in primary school, a proposal by the ruling Social Democrat party says. The party is drawing up a set of guiding principles ahead of a congress later this year.</p>
<p>- In the first half of the year rents on commercial space in central Stockholm rose much more than in other European capitals.</p>
<p>- Threat of a strike by pilots of charter company Blue Scandinavia may wreck plans of hundreds of travellers.</p>
<p>SVENSKA DAGBLADET</p>
<p>- Young people may face tougher rules when applying for drivers' licenses. The authorities are planning to look into ways to cut down on the number of road accidents involving inexperienced drivers, possibly by forbidding very new drivers from driving at night.</p>
<p>- Television advertising aimed at children cannot be stopped, a European Union court decided on Wednesday. Swedish law currently bans advertising directed towards children under the age of 12.</p>
<p>- Market capitalisation of the Stockholm Stock Exchange is now larger than Swedish Gross Domestic Product (GDP). After setting records seven days running, the bourse's market capitalisation is over two billion crowns for the first time.</p>
<p>DAGENS INDUSTRI</p>
<p>- Published only on Fridays for the next three weeks because of summer holidays.</p>
