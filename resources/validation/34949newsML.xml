<title>ISRAEL: Israeli jailed for contact with Iranian agent.</title>

<p>A Jerusalem court jailed an Israeli citizen on Thursday for three years for having made contact with an intelligence agent of arch-enemy Iran, the domestic Itim news agency said.</p>
<p>Israel Radio said Herzl Rad had insisted he made the contact through the Iranian embassy in Turkey in March last year in a bid ultimately to persuade Israeli intelligence to take him into its ranks.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole intention was to help the country,&quot; Rad's brother Haim told the radio.</p>
<p>Itim said he was given a sentence of six years, three of them in jail.</p>
<p>But the defendant, described by Israeli security officials as a 33-year-old clothing merchant of Iranian descent who lived in Jerusalem, told the radio after the sentencing: &quot;I cannot say I'm satisfied.&quot;</p>
<p>An indictment had originally accused Herzl Rad of spying. But the judges found him guilty only of illegal contact with a foreign agent.</p>
<p>It said Iranian officials arranged his transport from Turkey to Iran where he was questioned by Iranian security officials and assigned to enter Israeli army installations and report back to a contact person in return for $10,000.</p>
<p>The indictment said he was later arrested in Israel.</p>
