<p>President Yahya Jammeh's party won an overwhelming majority in Gambia's new parliament on Friday after elections wrapping up a return to civilian rule in the West African nation following his 1994 military coup.</p>
<p>Final results from Thursday's poll showed Jammeh's Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC) had 33 of the assembly's 49 seats, giving it more than the two-thirds majority it requires on constitutional issues.</p>
<p>Jammeh has the power to nominate a further four lawmakers.</p>
<p>Lawyer Ousainou Darboe's main opposition United Democratic Party managed to win only seven seats.</p>
<p>The National Reconciliation Party of hotel manager Hamat Bah, like Darboe a defeated presidential contender in September, had two seats. Another former presidential candidate, Sida Jatta, won one seat for his leftist Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism. Independents had two.</p>
<p>Jammeh, a committed Moslem who had military training in the United States, staged a coup as a 29-year-old lieutenant in 1994, toppling the former British colony's civilian independence leader Sir Dawda Jawara.</p>
<p>Jammeh said at the time he had no political ambitions and that he simply wanted to put an end to government corruption, the tourist sex trade and drugs in the largely Moslem country of a million people.</p>
<p>But he banned established politicians with links with Jawara and then won a presidential election last September.</p>
<p>Jammeh's party won five of its 33 seats on Thursday by default in constituencies where it was unchallenged.</p>
<p>The Independent National Elections Commission which issued the final results put turnout at 73 percent, remarkable for the region but lower than the up to 90 percent in the presidential poll. More than 446,000 Gambians were registered to vote.</p>
<p>The comforting news for the opposition appeared to be the entry into parliament of two of Jammeh's challengers in the presidential race, both of them articulate politicians.</p>
<p>Chief opposition leader Darboe, who did not stand for parliament, took refuge in Senegal's embassy for days during and after the presidential poll saying he feared for his safety.</p>
<p>Thursday's poll was peaceful and without incident.</p>
<p>Under Gambia's new constitution, approved by referendum in August, parliament can impeach the president on a two-thirds majority. It can also block ministerial appointments.</p>
<p>Gambia fronts the Atlantic and is surrounded by French-speaking Senegal. Its economy is based on tourism, groundnuts and foreign aid.</p>
<p>Jammeh's coup estranged Western donors. Some advised nationals against visiting on security grounds, hitting tourism. Jammeh has since developed ties with Libya, Taiwan and Cuba.</p>
