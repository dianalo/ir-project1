<p>Look out Hollywood, President Bill Clinton is upset at the way he is being portrayed in a new hit movie, &quot;Contact.&quot;</p>
<p>In the movie about earth contact with an extraterrestrial civilisation, Clinton is pictured talking about the potential significance of the breakthrough.</p>
<p>It was actually sound bites from remarks he made last summer when scientists announced a meteorite from Mars contained a possible sign of life on the red planet.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said on Monday the movie went beyond typical satire and parody for which Clinton is caricatured frequently.</p>
<p>The White House told the director its policy prohibits the use of the president for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>&quot;You have manipulated images of the president's public statements, taken them out of the context in which they were uttered, and adapted them to fit the plot of your film,&quot; White House counsel Charles Ruff wrote in a sternly worded letter to &quot;Contact&quot; director Robert Zemeckis dated July 11.</p>
<p>&quot;By appropriating President Clinton's image and words in this manner, you have essentially given him a role in your film without his authorisation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The letter did not threaten a lawsuit. White House officials said the message was they would not like to see this done again in another movie.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Zemeckis said he needed no White House consent to digitally superimpose Clinton's image into scenes with the film's stars, Jodie Foster, Angela Bassett and James Woods.</p>
<p>&quot;No, the president is in the public domain. He works for us. I hear he's a big fan of Jodie's,&quot; Zemeckis said.</p>
<p>Zemeckis similarly incorporated footage of late presidents John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon for scenes in the 1994 Oscar-winning film &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot;</p>
<p>The White House has also feuded with a local fast food firm over radio advertising in which an actor who sounds a lot like Clinton calls in to order a sandwich.</p>
