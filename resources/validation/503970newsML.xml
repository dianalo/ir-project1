<dateline>PARIS 1997-04-11</dateline>

<p>French shares finished lower on Friday, with traders citing concerns over a possible further rise in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>The market took a tumble after U.S. data showed a stronger-than-expected rise in core March producer prices and retail sales were revised upward for February, fuelling fears of inflationary pressure and the need for a tightening by the Fed.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed down 33.41 points or 1.28 percent at 2,574.56. The index was up 2.25 percent on the week. The CAC-40 futures contract was down 39 at 2,567 from Thursday's close. Volume was 5.47 billion francs.</p>
<p>Wall Street and other centres fell sharply on the statistics, and the CAC duly followed.</p>
<p>&quot;In period of uncertainty and in low volumes, the market follows Wall Street,&quot; said one operator.</p>
<p>On the downside, various brokers see support at 2,550 but below the 2,550/2,500 area, strong support was seen at 2,450. However, one broker said once a correction had taken place, the index could end the year at 2,800.</p>
<p>Accor was among rare risers, which added 2.55 percent to 846, viewed as a cheap buy, with revaluation potential under the new head, Jean-Marc Espalioux.</p>
<p>PSA Peugeot Citroen was up 1.28 percent at 634, slipstreaming behind strong Volkswagen first quarter sales.</p>
<p>Bouygues was up 0.36 percent. Lyonnaise des Eaux chairman Jerome Monod said in a newspaper interview Bouygues was one of companies it was talking to for a telecommunications partner.</p>
<p>Lyonnaise was suspended, as was Cie de Suez.</p>
<p>Suez confirmed the board would ask shareholders to approve a merger plan with Lyonnaise and set a dividend of 24.6 francs per share, totalling 3.8 billion francs. Suez is also cancelling five percent of its share capital.</p>
