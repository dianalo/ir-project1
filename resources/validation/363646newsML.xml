<p>French stocks set a third consecutive closing record after rallying on Friday on the back of a strong rise on Wall Street and a U.S. jobs report that eased financial markets' interest-rate fears.</p>
<p>&quot;You just can't go against a market for which people want to pay,&quot; said Olivier Blitz at IFF. He wonders whether the market is overvalued, &quot;but apparently it's not for the buyers, especially foreigners&quot;.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index finished up 39.09 points, or 1.53 percent, at 2,597.52. It hit an all time intraday high of 2,598.42 points.  </p>
<p>The U.S. Labor Department said non-farm payrolls, key data for indicating the strength of the U.S. economy, rose by 237,000 in January after an increase of 262,000 in December. The U.S. unemployment rate edged up unexpectedly to 5.4 percent from 5.3 percent in December. Economists said the data were bound to quell concerns that U.S. interest rates are headed higher.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. jobs report was excellent,&quot; Blitz said.</p>
<p>The dollar's surge against European currencies also benefitted the bourse. Market operators say any statement from G7 leaders meeting this weekend in Berlin is more likely to focus on the yen's weakness than on the dollar's strength.  </p>
<p>* Bourse volume was a heavy 11.8 billion francs.</p>
<p>* Generale des Eaux rallied 5.59 percent to 775 francs after Thursday's announcement that it and Havas had agreed to reshuffle assets, turning CGE into Havas's biggest shareholder with 29.6 percent. CGE Chairman Jean-Marie Messier said the deal would boost earnings per share by 10 percent from 1997. Havas shares closed down 3.72 percent at 432.30 francs.</p>
<p>* Shares in the auto sector outperformed as investors turned their attention to cyclical stocks expected to benefit from a recovery. Michelin, the object of recent positive reports, rose 3.54 percent to 342.60 francs.  </p>
<p>PSA Peugeot Citroen rallied 4.17 percent at 624 francs after reporting a 5.1 percent rise in 1996 turnover to 66.17 billion francs on a 7.6 percent increase in volumes worldwide.</p>
<p>* Elf Aquitaine, which has risen sharply in recent sessions on positive recommendations, slipped 0.34 percent to 582 francs. Financial group Paribas sold its remaining stake in Elf, or 1.98 million Elf shares, in New York. Paribas closed up 0.41 percent at 395.50 francs.</p>
<p>* Suez closed up 3.36 percent at 280 francs, boosted by expectations of further asset sales.  </p>
<p>* Re-insurer Scor rose 5.04 percent to 219 francs after deputy managing director Francois Reach said he expected an increase in the dividend for 1996. BZW put a buy recommendation on the share.</p>
<p>* Credit Lyonnais certificates shot up 16.90 francs to 186.60 after soon-to-be-privatised Thomson-CSF said it would sell its Credit Lyonnais stake back to the government at a price based on a December 1995 share price of 306.70 francs that values the certificate at 274 francs. One analyst said minority shareholders may seek to be bought out at that price as well.</p>
