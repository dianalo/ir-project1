<p>The European Union representative in Warsaw raised questions on Thursday over the extent of freedom of the news media, notably of television, in Poland.</p>
<p>Rolf Timans said the European Commission, would probe media freedom and other controversial issues in a report on how well Poland is prepared for accession -- the &quot;avis&quot; -- due to be ready by mid-1997.</p>
<p>&quot;There are several question marks as regards freedom of media, especially television,&quot; Timans wrote in an article published on Thursday in the Rzeczpospolita daily.</p>
<p>He said other issues the Commission would examine closely in its report included civilian control over the armed forces and accessibility of the justice system to the average citizen.</p>
<p>&quot;Certain problems are to be noticed in the sphere of legislation and the justice system,&quot; Timans wrote.</p>
<p>The Commission's avis will be the base for accession talks, which Poland hopes to begin early next year so it can join the community around the year 2000 or 2002.</p>
<p>Brussels diplomats say that 2002 is the earliest realistic entry date for Poland and other former Soviet bloc countries aspiring to join, such as the Czech Republic and Hungary.</p>
<p>Poland's right-centrist opposition charges that the ruling leftist coalition of ex-communists and a Peasant party has grabbed substantial influence over public television, the country's main source of news, and aims to use it in the campaign for this year's parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a group of journalists and other employees published a letter, protesting against alleged attempts to politicise public television and the chaos stemming from frequent changes of management.</p>
<p>The changes began last year when the right-leaning head of the television Wieslaw Walendziak quit, alleging pressure from the two ruling parties.</p>
<p>Since then many senior television managers have quit or been fired and some hard-hitting current affairs programmes associated with the former management have been scrapped.</p>
