<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Indonesian President Suharto discussed human rights, including the contentious East Timor issue, on Monday, officials said.</p>
<p>German delegation sources said Kohl had also invited East Timorese Nobel Peace laureate Bishop Carlos Belo to meet him during his stay in Jakarta.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known whether Belo had accepted the invitation and there was no answer from his home in the East Timor capital, Dili. Church sources said he might see Kohl before the chancellor leaves for Manila on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>A major focus of the visit is trade and economic ties, with a number of ministers and businessmen accompanying the chancellor.</p>
<p>Germany is Indonesia's largest European market with two-way trade estimated at US$4.46 billion in 1995, up 75 percent from 1990.</p>
<p>Indonesia's State Secretary Murdiono told reporters after the meeting between Suharto and Kohl that they had discussed human rights issues.</p>
<p>Kohl, who arrived for his fourth visit to Indonesia on Saturday and spent Sunday relaxing and fishing with Suharto, had been expected to raise the matter of human rights.</p>
<p>&quot;The president (Suharto) explained about the implementation of human rights in Indonesia and also about the development in East Timor,&quot; Murdiono said.</p>
<p>&quot;The implementation of human rights certainly cannot be separated from the nation's historical values,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Bishop Belo was joint recipient of the 1996 Nobel peace award with self-exiled East Timorese resistance leader Jose Ramos-Horta. The award to Ramos-Horta -- who called on Kohl to raise East Timor during his Jakarta visit -- has angered many Indonesians.</p>
<p>Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in December 1975 and declared it Indonesia's 27th provinces the following July in a move the United Nations has refused to recognise.</p>
<p>Suharto presented Kohl with an honorary membership in the Indonesian Engineers' Association during the chancellor's official visit to Merdeka (Freedom) Palace, where he was greeted with an artillery salute under overcast skies.</p>
<p>In a speech following the award, Kohl said the future achievement of political leaders would be measured by their capability to meet challenges based on the principles of social justice and democracy.</p>
<p>He said that in this regard human rights was &quot;central to the future&quot; and was an issue that should be discussed among friends.</p>
<p>Kohl also praised Indonesia for having one of the world's dynamic economies.</p>
<p>&quot;The general situation which is stable, with sustained high economic growth and high achievements in education and the sciences, has made Indonesia one of the key countries in the Southeast Asia region,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also called for increased trade and cooperation between the two countries, which he said should also involved small and medium industries.</p>
<p>&quot;I see possibilities for further cooperation, including the development of infrastructure and Indonesia's natural resources,&quot; Kohl said.</p>
<p>He specifically mentioned such areas as expansion of regional airports and air transport, the railway network, power generation and telecommunications.</p>
