<title>UK: British minister playing politics over bomb-Labour.</title>

<p>The two suspected IRA bombs in northern England provoked a row between British politicians on Wednesday when the opposition Labour Party accused a minister of trying to make political capital out of it.</p>
<p>Interior minister Michael Howard used the explosions on a railway line near the town of Wilmslow to attack Labour leader Tony Blair over his record in opposing guerrilla violence.</p>
<p>Howard issued a statement saying Blair had never voted for renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act which gives British police special powers to fight violence by the Irish Republican Army and other guerrilla groups.</p>
<p>Parliament holds an annual debate on renewal of the act, and in recent years Labour has abstained or voted against because of its criticism of some of its provisions.</p>
<p>Howard said that even in 1994, when news that the IRA had mortar-bombed London's Heathrow Airport had come in while the parliamentary debate was going on, Blair, then his party's home affairs spokesman, told Labour MPs to vote against renewal.</p>
<p>&quot;His vote -- and the votes of his party -- show you cannot trust Labour to be tough on terrorism,&quot; Howard said.</p>
<p>But Blair, whose party is apparently cruising towards victory in a May 1 election, immediately accused Howard of breaching an agreement between senior British politicians that they would coordinate their response to bombings.</p>
<p>&quot;For anyone to try to make political capital out of a terrorist outrage is unacceptable. For the home secretary to do so is reprehensible,&quot; Blair said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;This issue is too serious to become a political football for a home secretary whose desperation to score points has exceeded his judgement.&quot;</p>
