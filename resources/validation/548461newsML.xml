<p>Portugal's Credit Institute opted to launch its 13 billion yen dual currency bond because it offered cheaper finance than the domestic market, its chairman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Vitor Bento, President of the Institute for Public Credit Management (IGCP), which sets the country's debt policy, said that he would continue to raise funds abroad whenever conditions were advantageous.</p>
<p>He told Reuters that the yen bond was a swap deal into escudos at an &quot;all-in&quot; cost of three-month Lisbor less 27 basis points. Lisbor was set at 5.84 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Institute's last issue of three-month Treasury bills on April 23 was made at an average 5.7037 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever there is the possibility of raising finance (abroad) at a lower cost compared with internally, the IGCP will do it,&quot; Bento said.</p>
<p>The 13 billion yen dual currency bond, with a coupon of 5.36 percent, expires on May 15, 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;The internal market displays spreads that are difficult to justify, the external market is the proof,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Bento said that as the market risk of the operation was in escudos, it was neutral in terms of liquidity creation.</p>
