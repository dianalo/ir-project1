<p>The Polish zloty closed nearly unchaged against the basket of currencies pinned up against a weeks-old resistance level at two percent from the parity rate trading band centre, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said small-scale early currency purchases could not erode the market's pro-zloty sentiment, sparked on Tuesday by an expected inflow from a $75 million privatisation deal.</p>
<p>&quot;Light currency seling in the morning could not dent the market's overall dollar-selling mood and the zloty remained around two percent from parity for most of the day,&quot; said Pawel Gajewski of Creditanstalt in Warsaw.  </p>
<p>The zloty closed at 2.05/2.01 percent from the trading band centre, nearly flat from Tuesday's close at 2.03/1.99 percent.</p>
<p>It was at 2.8093/13 to the dollar, down from 2.8070/80 on Tuesday and at 1.8373/83 to the mark, up from 1.8397/07.</p>
<p>Dealers said banks were inclined to keep foreign currency positions short, which pushes the zloty upwards, after the Polish central bank said credit action was growing too quickly and that real interest rates would rise in the near-term.</p>
<p>Lending to the non-financial sector grew 4.1 percent in September, against a 1.2 percent rise in broad money supply, which rose 18.2 percent in the January-September period.  </p>
<p>One-day rates eased to around the market's main 14-day drainage rate of 19.14 percent as more banks found excess cash after squaring their monthly required reserve levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates fell to drainage levels after holding high early this month as banks overinvested in NBP-bills in September and started the October reserve with very little cash on required reserve accounts,&quot; said Maciej Ratulowski of Bank Zachodni SA.</p>
<p>Overnight rates closed at 18.90/19.15 percent, down from 19.00/19.50 on Tuesday, and tomorrow/next were at 18.85/19.25 percent down from 19.0/19.5 percent.</p>
