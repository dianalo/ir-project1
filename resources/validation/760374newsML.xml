<p>Nepal plans to privatise a state-owned telecommunications company and a publishing house, Finance Minister Rabindra Nath Sharma said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Telecommunications Corporation and Gorkhapatra Corporation under the Ministry of Information and Communications have been selected for study under the third phase of privatisation,&quot; Sharma told parliament in a statement.</p>
<p>Under the first two phases the Himalayan kingdom sold off 15 public enterprises under an economic reform programme launched in 1992.</p>
<p>The Nepal Telecommunication Corporation (NTC) has a monopoly of telecommunication services and meets 41 percent of the total demand of 340,000 connections with its 140,000 telephone lines.</p>
<p>The Gorkhapatra Corporation has six publications including two daily newspapers, the English language Rising Nepal and the Nepali language Gorkhapatra, the country's oldest newspaper.</p>
<p>The communists, who dominate the nation's four-month-old centre-left coalition government, had criticised the privatisation drive while in opposition, saying some corporations had been undervalued.</p>
<p>&quot;The study (for the third phase) will take into account the financial and management status of the corporations, their business and market positions and prospects for growth,&quot; Tanka Khanal, privatisation chief at the Finance Ministry, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Sharma said the government will take care of employee interests while moving ahead with privatisation.</p>
<p>Last year, the government invited private firms to start radio paging, wireless in local loop (WLL) and mobile phone services to meet the country's increasing demand for telephone lines.</p>
<p>But the move was challenged in the Supreme Court which has yet to give its verdict. Without the court's ruling the government cannot implement its privatisation plan.</p>
