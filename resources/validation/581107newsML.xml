<p>The Indonesian rupiah was steady against the dollar in slow early trading on Tuesday, with the focus on liquidity, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said operators were mostly sidelined on a lack of fresh factors. The focus was on liquidity, which was anticipated to be tight this week, one local bank dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a lethargic market in general. Some trades were seen but they are for position squaring,&quot; one dealer in Singapore said, adding trading in other currencies was slow too.  </p>
<p>Dealers said overnight rupiah was relatively stable at 13.0/14.0 percent in the morning, but operators were cautious because of weekly tax payments due Tuesday.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was at 2,427.75/28.00 at 0245 GMT against an opening of 2,427.0/28.0. Tomorrow and today rupiah were at 2,427.25/27.50 and 2,426.75/27.00, respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;The market appears to be directionless. Operators tend to stay on the sidelines,&quot; the Singapore dealer said.</p>
<p>He said the market was short in the forward market while long on dollars on the spot side, reflected by continuously high tom/next swap rates of late.  </p>
<p>Some dealers said going long on dolalrs appeared to be justified because of some uncertainty over the ongoing campaign for the May 29 general elections. But others said it was not profitable because of expensive daily roll-over cost.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know whether it's advisable to go long on dollars as the day-to-day rolls are some 0.5 points,&quot; one said, adding that it was expensive to extend those positions since the rupiah was not depreciating as fast as it usually did.</p>
<p>Overnight swap was at 0.60/0.65 and tom/next at 0.51/0.53.</p>
<p>&quot;Tom/next swaps are very well bid,&quot; the dealer said.  </p>
<p>Another dealer said the low attraction of holding long dollars although it could be justified because of political concerns was one reason for the lethargy in the market.</p>
<p>One-month swaps were at 13.75/14.65, two at 26.5/27.5, three at 39.0/39.5 and six at 77.50/78.25 points.</p>
<p>The central bank lowered its intervention band by one point to 2,406/2,598 and the conversion band also by one point to 2,406/2,454 on Monday, following a similar one-point appreciation last Friday.</p>
