<p>Romania will start the second phase of a road rehabilitation programme worth $550 million but lack of funds will push plans to build highways into the next century, Transport Minister Traian Basescu said on Thursday.</p>
<p>He told a news conference the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development had agreed to disburse $83 million to finance upgrading works on some 400 km (250 miles) of roads in the Transylvania region.</p>
<p>The loan is part of a $553 million project to improve Romania's potholed road network. The second phase aims to continue the rehabilitation of 1,000 km (625 miles) of roads, Basescu said, ading that works will start early next year.</p>
<p>The roadworks would improve existing carriageways as well as several bridges and retaining walls, ministry sources said.</p>
<p>Basescu said his ministry hoped to secure from the World Bank a $150 million loan to supplement funds for the project.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to finalise those talks in January,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Romania's roads and railways were neglected under the communists and have since deteriorating further due to lack of funds for repairs and growing traffic.</p>
<p>&quot;Our priority is to upgrade roads heading to Western countries. Romania cannot integrate in the European Union without an acceptable infrastructure,&quot; Basescu said.</p>
<p>Basescu said the new centrist cabinet which emerged from November's general election had all but abandoned a project to build a high-speed motorway across Romania.</p>
<p>&quot;For the time being we can't finance such a project. We might talk again about it in a few years,&quot; he said. &quot;This doesn't mean that we are giving up plans to build highways. The project is feasible through concessions and foreign capital.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, parliament passed a draft law awarding road concessions in a bid to improve the infrastructure.</p>
<p>In 1995, Romania announced plans to award concessions worth $1.8 billion to foreign investors as part of a broader programme to improve roads. Official estimates say Romania needs about $30 billion to repair and develop its road, rail, air and sea transport by the year 2005.</p>
<p>Ministry sources recently said two-thirds of Romania's road network of 14,500 km (9,000 miles) needed immediate repairs.</p>
