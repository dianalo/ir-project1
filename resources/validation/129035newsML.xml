<p>In an election marred by initial confusion and delays, Nicaraguans voted on Sunday for a new president with the main choice between a former Sandinista revolutionary leader and a right-winger backed by allies of the late former dictator Anastasio Somoza.</p>
<p>The election for president pits Washington's old bogeyman, former leftist Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega, against burly right-winger Arnoldo Aleman.</p>
<p>Confusion and technical glitches delayed the scheduled start of voting at 7 a.m. local time (1300 GMT) in many of the 8,995 polling stations and electoral authorities said 100,000 eligible voters had been left off electoral rolls by mistake.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't eaten, I haven't slept, I haven't bathed since yesterday when they gave me the voting material,&quot; Antonio Moreno, head of one voting booth that failed to open on time told Reuters. &quot;But even now I can't install the booth because none of the other officials have shown up.&quot;</p>
<p>Dutch ambassador to Central America Frans Van Haren, part of a European Union team of election monitors, told Reuters that of the 13 booths he visited during what was meant to be the first hour of voting &quot;only one has everything ready to open&quot;.</p>
<p>First results from the 2.4 million registered voters were expected early on Monday. The winner must poll 45 percent to avoid a second round run-off in late November or early December.</p>
<p>Although 23 candidates are on the ballot only those of the left or the right have any real chance of winning. The bitter battle at the ballot box mirrors the left-right struggle that has torn Nicaragua, the second poorest country in the Americas after Haiti, for much of this century.</p>
<p>Topping voter preferences going into Sunday's poll was Aleman, a lawyer running for the right-wing Liberal Alliance. His backers include Miami exiles formerly allied to the brutal Somoza family dictatorship which ruled Nicaragua for much of this century -- and which Aleman refuses to condemn.</p>
<p>Just behind him was Ortega, the leader of Nicaragua's revolutionary Sandinistas who overthrew Somoza, fought U.S.-backed contra rebels and governed the country from 1979 to 1990 before losing power in an election to current centrist president Violeta Chamorro.</p>
<p>A final opinion poll taken by CID-Gallup last week measured Aleman's support at 40.5 percent, 2.6 percentage points ahead of Ortega.</p>
<p>Analysts say the deciding factor in a race dominated by two old-style political strongmen is the allegiance of the poor.</p>
<p>In a country where more than half the population lacks a proper job, both Aleman and Ortega have pledged economic recovery and strong leadership after the rudderless six-year rule of Chamorro -- Latin America's only female head of state.</p>
<p>&quot;I got here at 4 a.m. to vote, so that the future holds something to eat and so that we don't return to repression,&quot; said Josefa Gomez, 71, an Aleman supporter who said Nicaragua would be ruined if it returned to Sandinista rule.</p>
<p>Ortega supporters call Aleman the candidate of the rich, who did nothing for the poor as mayor of Managua.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be a sad day for the poor if Aleman wins,&quot; said Jose Laguna, 39, a street sweeper.</p>
<p>Both Aleman and Ortega have sought to paint themselves as modern, business-friendly moderates with development and reconciliation at the top of their agendas.</p>
<p>The United States has assured voters it will respect the vote whichever way it goes.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not taking sides in this election. We can accept whoever the Nicaraguan people select,&quot; Brian Atwood, President Bill Clinton's envoy to the elections, said late on Saturday.</p>
<p>Aleman, who was once a prisoner of Ortega's government, has raised tensions among his opponents by demanding that top Sandinistas pay for state-owned properties they seized before leaving office.</p>
<p>He has also refused to denounce former dictator Somoza, saying the Sandinistas that toppled him are a greater evil.</p>
<p>Apart from choosing the president, voters will also choose a vice president, 145 mayors and 145 councilors, 90 federal deputies and 20 members of the Central American parliament.</p>
