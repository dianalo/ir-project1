<p>President Bill Clinton and Republican rival Bob Dole end their marathon campaigns for the White House on Monday before heading home to await the voters' choice in Tuesday's election.</p>
<p>For both career politicians, it is a last campaign hurrah.</p>
<p>Underdog Dole is hoping for a Truman-like miracle finish. A confident Clinton is hoping to hold on to his big lead in pre-election polls. Both are ending their campaign careers with nostalgic nods to the political past.</p>
<p>Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who is the Reform Party candidate and is given no chance in the polls, planned to broadcast several half-hour-long commercials on Monday evening.</p>
<p>At campaign stops in Florida on Sunday, Clinton likened himself to Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, two Republicans. Across the country in California, Dole claimed the mantle of feisty Democratic President Harry Truman and planned to end his last campaign sprint in Truman's hometown of Independence, Missouri, after charging across Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Tennesee and Iowa.</p>
<p>Dole hopes to repeat Truman's 1948 upset win over heavily favoured Republican Tom Dewey.</p>
<p>Well after midnight, he will go to his prairie crossroads hometown of Russell, Kansas, to vote with his wife, Elizabeth, who has been at his side throughout a whirlwind 96-hour rush to the finish line that started last Friday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't stayed up around the clock since I fought the Nazis in World War II,&quot; said Dole, whose right arm remains useless from combat wounds that nearly killed him.</p>
<p>The 73-year-old campaigner remains well behind Clinton in most polls, except for a Reuters/Zogby tracking poll on Sunday that put him within four percentage points of Clinton.</p>
<p>At a pre-dawn rally outside a Phoenix, Arizona diner, Dole told the crowd &quot;there is a poll out this morning that shows it's a dead heat. It's tied across America. If that poll is accurate and it's tied today, we'll win tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Other polls gave Clinton a commanding lead. An ABC Television tracking poll gave Clinton a 51-40 lead and an NBC Television/Wall Street Journal poll put Clinton ahead 49-37.</p>
<p>A confident Clinton spent the final hours of his last campaign trying to make sure his supporters go to the polls. He campaigned along the eastern seaboard on Sunday, starting in sunny Florida and ending in Maine well after midnight with an airport rally in Bangor. As he walked to the plane after the rally, he said, &quot;It's going to be a good last day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is an election of enormous moment,&quot; he told more than 20,000 people who turned out to cheer him in Springfield, Massachusetts. &quot;I want us to do more together. It takes a village to raise a child and build a country and create a future.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton's election-eve stumping on Monday began at the Merrimack Restaurant in Manchester where President John F. Kennedy, Clinton's boyhood idol, launched his campaign in 1960.</p>
<p>He planned to travel to Cleveland for a noontime rally with Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Tipper Gore. He then flies across the Midwest, stopping in Lexington, Kentucky, Des Moines, Iowa, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota, before flying home to Little Rock, Arkansas where he will vote and await word on who will be the next president.</p>
