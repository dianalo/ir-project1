<title>NETHERLANDS: France and Netherlands kiss and make up on drugs.</title>
<headline>France and Netherlands kiss and make up on drugs.</headline>

<text>
<p>France and the Netherlands kissed and made up, literally, on Thursday to celebrate their new-found accord on drugs policy.</p>
<p>To celebrate an accord struck on Monday to set aside differences over drugs policy and instead to work together to fight drugs smuggling, French Justice Minister Jacques Toubon gave his Dutch counterpart Winnie Sorgdrager a kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the conclusion which can be drawn is that we enjoy excellent relations,&quot; Toubon told a news conference on the sidelines of a meeting of EU justice ministers.</p>
<p>The two sides had been at loggerheads over drugs policy, with France accusing the Netherlands, through its liberal drugs policy, of making it possible for young people to buy drugs to circulate elsewhere.</p>
<p>Although drugs are illegal in the Netherlands, small amounts of soft drugs can be bought in so-called coffee shops and the police turn a blind eye to the possession of small amounts of hard drugs.</p>
<p>Under the accord the two sides will increase cooperation at customs.</p>
<p>Sorgdrager said the two sides, along with their EU partners would also investigate the availability of drugs in prison and cooperate with eastern European governments to try to stem the flow of designer drugs like ecstasy and crack.</p>
