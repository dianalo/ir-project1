<p>Healthy cover and the absence of either a price or yield tail at this morning's five-year gilt auction bode well for the next auction, due Thursday, analysts say.</p>
<p>The Bank of England auctioned 1.5 billion stg of 7.0 percent gilts due 2002, garnering cover of 3.03 times.</p>
<p>The strength of demand was also indicated by the absence of difference between the lowest accepted price and the average price as well as between the highest accepted yield and the average accepted yield.</p>
<p>&quot;The five year is relatively cheap on the curve so it's no surprise it's gone so well,&quot; said HSBC bond economist Philip Tyson.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll expect the same for the ultra-long auction on Thursday -- practically no tail and good cover,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>On Thursday, the central bank will be auctioning 1.5 billion stg of 8.0 percent stock due 2021.</p>
<p>Domestic players are expected to be the main buyers of the long-dated stock as they were of today's issue with foreign interest largely restricted to 10-year paper.</p>
<p>But where five-year gilts are usually swallowed up by banks and building societies, pension funds and insurance firms -- those with long term liabilities -- are the main buyers of longer maturities.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Thursday probably looks to go pretty well,&quot; said Kleinwort Benson gilt analyst Steve Scott.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect with the flattening of the yield curve we have had over the last couple of weeks people might use the long auction on Thursday to fill in any short positions,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The gilt futures market tried to go better on the announcement but failed, possibly because traders are awaiting the outcome of today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, to see if interest rates are going to rise.</p>
<p>By 1042 GMT, LIFFE June gilts were up 4/32 compared with Monday's close, standing at 113-18/32 after a brief visit up at 113-21/32 on optimism before the auction result.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very good result but the market hasn't really responded. It may be we need to come back to around 113-12/32 before we can go on,&quot; one saleswoman at a market-maker said.</p>
<p>&quot;It may be that the FOMC is putting a bit of a cap on the market,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Dealers said they thought the bonds had gone into fairly safe hands although there was some concern about a rumour that a market-maker was sitting on a sizeable chunk of the stock.</p>
<p>&quot;It perhaps hasn't gone into hands that are quite as safe as we'd like,&quot; a salesman at a UK brokerage said.</p>
<p>He added that he thought much of the demand for the bonds came from operators who were switching out of other gilts rather than from an influx of new money.  </p>
<p>But overall, the funding outlook remains encouraging with the government likely to undershoot its forecast of a 19.2 billion stg public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR), and therefore also undercut the central governent borrowing requirment which gilts sales are supposed to fund.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the likely profile of the PSBR this year, even if you go with our view that there won't be a significant fiscal tightening in the forthcoming budget, just the general health of economy should ensure the receipt side performs well should mean there isn't too much pressure on funding,&quot; Morgan Stanley economist Mark Miller said.</p>
<p>Gilt sales also have to fund some 20 billion stg of redemptions in the 1997-98 fiscal year -- the highest ever level -- but the authorities are carrying forward an overfund of some 4.0 billion stg from fiscal 1996-97 which will partially offset the level of sales needed.</p>
