<p>Germany's tax reform, aimed at substantially reducing tax levels, is still on course despite the estimated 18 billion marks of 1997 tax shortfalls, the Free Democrat (FDP) government coalition partners said on Thursday.</p>
<p>FDP general secretary Guido Westerwelle told a news briefing that his party was &quot;confident&quot; that the tax reform would go ahead as planned.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the direction of this will be maintained,&quot; Westerwelle said.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures show that high taxes do not equate to high revenues for the state...We must loosen the tax screw so that the economy can pick up again,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The finance ministry said earlier Germany's overall tax revenues will fall 18.0 billion marks short of target in 1997, raising questions as to how Bonn would ensure state deficits were in line with requirements for the euro.</p>
<p>Westerwelle said he did not believe however that the tax shortfall would have any effect either on the proposed cut to the &quot;solidarity tax&quot;, which funds east German development, or made any likelier a much-speculated increase in fuel taxes.</p>
<p>Peter Struck, parliamentary business manager for the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), had earlier said on German radio he believed the FDP would change its tack on fuel taxes directly after its party congress, due to start next week.</p>
