<headline>H&amp;R Block reports widening loss, cites CompuServe.</headline>
<dateline>KANSAS CITY, Mo. 1997-02-20</dateline>

<p>H&amp;R Block Inc., the nation's biggest tax preparer, said Thursday, its losses more than quadrupled in its fiscal third quarter and blamed nearly half the red ink on the ailing CompuServe online service.</p>
<p>CompuServe, the world's No. 2 online service, also reported a loss and said its membership had dropped.</p>
<p>&quot;Returning CompuServe to profitability is our No. 1 goal,&quot; H&amp;R Block Chief Executive Frank Salizzoni, whose company owns 80.1 percent of CompuServe, said in a statement.</p>
<p>H&amp;R Block posted a loss of $25.3 million, or 24 cents a share, for the quarter ended Jan. 31, compared with loss of $5.5 million, or 5 cents a share, in the previous fiscal year's third quarter.</p>
<p>The loss was below industry analysts' expectations. Analysts on average had forecast a loss of 30 cents a share, according to the First Call service.</p>
<p>Kansas City, Mo.-based H&amp;R Block reported record revenues of $363.1 million for the quarter, a 16 percent increase over the year-ago quarter's $311.8 million.</p>
<p>H&amp;R Block stock dropped 25 cents to $29.875 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, CompuServe Corp., reported a loss of $14.2 million, or 15 cents a share, for its third quarter. H&amp;R Block said that worked out to a loss for it of $11.4 million, or 11 cents per H&amp;R Block share.</p>
<p>The remaining 19.9 percent of CompuServe was spun off in a stock offering last April. CompuServe stock was up 62.5 cents at $11.125 on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Columbus, Ohio-based CompuServe, whose Chief Executive Robert Massey resigned Monday, also reported a drop in overall membership. It said it would continue to invest in its commercial networking business, which has been successful.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue to invest for growth (in CompuServe) but only if we are convinced that growth will be profitable,&quot; said Salizzoni, who is CompuServe's chairman and acting chief executive in addition to heading H&amp;R Block.</p>
<p>H&amp;R Block also suffered a pre-tax loss in its tax preparation business, which it said handles one in every seven returns filed with the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>H&amp;R Block Tax Services Inc. reported a third-quarter pretax loss of $21.4 million, compared with a loss of $23.7 million in the previous year's quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;The tax business is benefiting from continuing investments which began last May,&quot; Salizzoni said. He said the company had added 250 new offices and had significantly improved its technology. The company had nearly 8,300 U.S. offices last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Milder winter weather has also contributed to increased business, unlike last year when January snowstorms hit the East,&quot; Salizzoni said.</p>
<p>Salizzoni said the company was extremely pleased with the company's tax business, but cautioned it was premature to predict results for the entire tax season ending April 15 and noted the tax season in Canada was just beginning.</p>
<p>Its international tax services -- the company has offices in Australia and 15 other countries and territories -- saw a loss of $5.8 million, up from a loss of $5.6 million in last fiscal year's period.</p>
<p>H&amp;R Block saw greatly improved profits from its Block Financial Corp., which is involved in loans based on anticipated tax returns and home equity loans.</p>
<p>Block Financial's income hit $7.8 million in the quarter, a 270 percent rise from $2.1 million a year ago.</p>
