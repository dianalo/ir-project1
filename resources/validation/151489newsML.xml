<p>Analysts on Tuesday said they would stand behind their views of telecom group Nokia's outlook after its Swedish rival Ericsson reported nine-month results squarely in line with predictions.</p>
<p>Ericsson's report did not change their assessments on Nokia, which is due to release January-September results on November 14. Analysts were, however, still working on their forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;The result was entirely as expected and won't change my outlook for Nokia at all,&quot; said Jyrki Hilli of Arctos Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think anybody will be making very big adjustments in their Nokia forecasts on the basis of this,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The trend in Ericsson's net sales, rising to 78. 20 billion crowns in the nine months to end-September from 66.90 billion in the year-ago period, boded well for Nokia's earnings prospects, Hilli said.</p>
<p>That view was backed by Protos Securities analyst Jari Vayrynen: &quot;The third quarter was even a shade better than expected ... It shows that the underlying business is doing well,&quot; he said. &quot;There was no bad news.&quot;</p>
<p>Ericsson said it was strengthening its position as a leading supplier of digital mobile phones, but analysts did not expect this to be at the expense of Nokia's market share.</p>
<p>&quot;It is Motorola Inc who is losing and will continue to lose for some quarters,&quot; said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>&quot;Nokia will at least hold its (market) share,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Though Ericsson's result brought no surprises, Ericsson and Nokia fell after the report as investors took profits from steady gains since end-July.</p>
<p>Nokia earlier fell to a session low of 207.00 markka, down four percent from Monday's 215.50 close, but firmed to 213.00 markka in late afternoon trade.</p>
<p>General softness on the bourse also dragged the share.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole environment has been soft today,&quot; Hilli said, adding that Ericsson had been expected to weigh in with good news and so the in-line result did not boost the market as it could have if expectations had been dimmer.</p>
<p>&quot;Ericsson has risen 13 percent in a month, Nokia has gained 6-7 percent, and Motorola has fallen 8 percent,&quot; Vayrynen said.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems obvious that some people thought it was now time to take a few profits.&quot;</p>
