<p>A world conference on solar energy ends in Zimbabwe on Tuesday after winning resounding pledges of political support, but with some delegates unhappy over lack of concrete financial backing for an ambitious plan to provide energy to all.</p>
<p>Several speakers said at the opening of the two-day World Solar Summit on Monday they were solidly behind a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organistion (UNESCO) World Solar Programme that aims to provide energy to 2.4 billion people living without electricity.</p>
<p>But some added -- after Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe opened the conference calling for political and financial support -- that the emphasis should shift to winning financial help to implement about 300 projects presented at the summit.</p>
<p>Pakistani President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari commended the World Bank for its recent pledge to help promote the use of solar and other renewable sources of energy.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that other multilateral agencies such as the Asian Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank and also enlightened donor countries will commit themselves to the idea of the solar energy system and all such organisations will truly reflect this commitment through their programmes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mugabe lamented poor funding for renewable energy sources, which he said averaged only three percent of multilateral banks' lending portfolios. He said this was ironic in view of the value of the emerging worldwide market for renewable energy technologies estimated at $40 billion a year.</p>
<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who on Sunday criticised rich Western countries for showing little interest in the Harare summit, said on Monday there was need for technological and financial cooperation between the developed nations and the Third World.</p>
<p>&quot;Our agenda should focus on development of a more effective partnership,&quot; he said hours after complaining about the absence of leaders from industrialised states.</p>
<p>The conference has attracted only 10 heads of state and governments from an original 25 organisers were expecting.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the world needed new sources of energy because conventional power sources not only damaged the environment but were inadequate to meet increasing global energy demands.</p>
<p>&quot;It is estimated that global demand for fuel will increase by 30 percent over this period (the next 30 years) while demand for electricity will rise by well over two-and-a-half times,&quot; Boutros-Ghali said in a statement to the meeting held under a scorching sun in Harare.</p>
<p>&quot;Conservation and efficiency measures alone will not be enough to cope with this increase in demand. New sources of energy need to be found, developed and exploited quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>Christos Papoutsis, a member of the European Commission in charge of energy policies, urged the delegates from 100 countries to mobilise financial resources to make the development and use of renewable energy sources a reality in each of their countries.</p>
<p>&quot;The implementation of hundreds of strategic and priority projects on a global level now has to be our first priority,&quot; he said, in reference to the projects outlined at the conference under UNESCO's 1996-2005 World Solar Programme.</p>
