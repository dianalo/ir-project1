<p>Shenzhen's B share index edged higher on a cautious mood on Friday morning, with thin trading volume expected to provide weak support for short term gains, analysts said.</p>
<p>The foreign currency B index added 1.10 points or 0.73 percent to 152.26 on thin turnover of HK$23.1 million.</p>
<p>&quot;People are holding back, and I think the index is going to fluctuate in a narrow band in the afternoon,&quot; a trader at China Southern Securities said.  </p>
<p>&quot;People who sold on government crackdown rumours are now keeping their hands away from the markets,&quot; an analyst at a foreign investment bank said.</p>
<p>Talk of government measures to cool the markets began to swirl at the start of May, by which time the A and B indices had surged more than 50 percent from the beginning of 1997.</p>
<p>Trading in B shares is likely to remain thin in the near future, judging from the domestic stock market, traders said.</p>
<p>The A share index gained 1.41 points or 0.32 percent to 434.75 on light turnover of 2.6 billion yuan.  </p>
<p>Shenzhen Nanshan Power Station Co Ltd was the star on the B share market, gaining HK$0.25 or 5.75 percent to HK$4.60.</p>
<p>Among the A shares, market leader Shenzhen Development Bank, which has been under investigation for stock trading misconduct, was the most heavily traded at 25.2 million shares. Its price fell 0.35 yuan to 32.70 yuan.</p>
