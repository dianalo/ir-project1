<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures ended lower on Tuesday as the market succumbed to profit-taking after failing to climb above an early high due to strong technical resistance and a lack of fresh buying incentives.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market looked set to continue trading within its recent range as the downside remained supported by bargain hunting interest while players lacked conviction about the scope for further gains.</p>
<p>The lead Nikkei 225 September contract ended 150 points lower at 20,405 after testing a high of 20,680, partly on the back of the dollar's strong hold above 117 yen.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market's looking toppish in the near term. I think we could see a correction down to 20,200,&quot; a trader with a U.S. futures house said.</p>
<p>Taiwan stock index futures ended higher with activity dominated by players switching positions to the August contract ahead of July's expiry on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The August contract ended up 0.7 at 426.4 on volume of 2,439 lots. July was up 0.6 at 431.4 on 1,871 lots.</p>
