<p>Argentine Economy Minister Roque Fernandez said Sunday peso parity with the dollar will not only be maintained while President Carlos Menem is in office but also by whomever succeeds him in 1999, the Clarin daily reported Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is just not viable to think of a modification in the exchange rate. I believe we will have this parity for at least 10 years,&quot; he told Clarin in an interview from Washington where he is meeting International Monetary Fund officials.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of our history, floating the peso would introduce a level of volatility we are not ready to tolerate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Some economists have suggested Argentina should consider getting out of the convertibility plan that pegs the peso to the dollar one-to-one, which has has been widely credited for allowing Argentina to beat decades of high inflation.</p>
<p>Fernandez also told Clarin the government will continue with a project to eliminate VAT exemptions and reduce the levy to 18 percent from 21 percent. Fernandez unveiled a tax package in August that extended VAT to a number of services, as well as hikes in fuel and income tax.</p>
<p>Argentine lawmakers, who approved the package last week, scrapped the VAT clauses from the government's bill.</p>
