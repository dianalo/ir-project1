<p>Italian shares closed mostly higher in very high volume trading with banks and insurances making the running while energy group ENI slid in late trading on rumours a broker had called on its clients to take profits on the stock.</p>
<p>The all-share mibtel index finished 1.79 percent higher at 12,653 with the blue chip mib30 index closing 1.96 percent up at 18,967. Brokers estimated that trading volume was in excess of 2.5 trillion lire.</p>
<p>ENI, which had opened at 9,210 lire, slightly down from Wednesday's close, dropped sharply in late trading to 9,110 lire on the sell rumour before closing at 9,140 lire, a fall of 1.55 percent on the day.</p>
<p>Telecom stocks also lost ground or were almost unchanged after the steady gains of recent sessions as investors rotated their buying from one sector to the next. Brokers said that most domestic fund managers were now up to weight in telecoms which eased on a lack of buying interest.</p>
<p>State telecom group Stet ordinary shares closed 0.19 percent higher at 7,980 lire, Telecom Italia finished 1.67 percent lower at 4,650 lire and Telecom Italia Mobile was fractionally higher at 0.04 percent.</p>
<p>With banks and insurance stocks firmly in the sights of domestic buyers, San Paolo closed 5.09 percent higher at 11,300 lire, outstripped by Ambroveneto, 5.94 percent ahead at 4,440 lire.</p>
<p>The biggest gainer was Marzotto savings stock, up 9.65 percent to close at 12,500 lire, followed by savings shares in Banca Nazionale Agricoltura, closing 9.18 percent up at 723 lire.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi's planned meeting with metal and engineering industry unions and employers was expected to be a domestic talking point on Friday.</p>
