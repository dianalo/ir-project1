<p>Bondholders have no plans at present to file a lawsuit against a Florida power plant partnership that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last week, an attorney for the bondholders said Monday.</p>
<p>Almost $300 million of industrial development municipal revenue bonds were sold to finance the construction of the plant and those bonds are now in technical default because of the bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p>&quot;The partnership had informed us of its intent to file. We were supportive of the filing. At this point, we are very much co-operating with the partnership,&quot; said Nancy Mitchell, an attorney with the Chicaco law firm McDermott, Will and Emery.</p>
<p>Asked if the bondholders planned to sue the power plant owners, Mitchell said, &quot;At this point we don't anticipate that.&quot;</p>
<p>She said it had not been determined whether the plant owners would meet the next debt service payment on June 1.</p>
<p>However, Mitchell said, &quot;They certainly have not informed us that they don't intend to make it.&quot;</p>
<p>Mitchell said the power projects were still operating and their assets protected under the banktrupcy filing.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point, were not really looking at much of anything except successful resolution of the FPL situation,&quot; itchell said, adding that there were 10 to 15 bondholders, mostly institutional, and that at least 90 percent of them were part of the commitees that hired her firm.</p>
<p>Palm Beach County, Fla., issued three series of industrial development bonds totalling $288.5 million in 1993 and 1994 to finance construction of two cogeneration plants in Okeelanta and Osceola, Fla.</p>
<p>The plants are owned by the Okeelanta Power and Gator Generating Company Limited Partnerships, which are affiliated with Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co, a unit of PG&amp;E Corp and Bechtel Enterprises and Flo-Sun Inc, one of Florida's largest sugarcane growers.</p>
<p>The partnerships said the bankruptcy filing was necessary because of a legal dispute with Florida Power &amp; Light Co over FPL's obligation to buy power produced by the plants.</p>
<p>Bondholders include Goldman Sachs &amp; Co, which was the original underwriter, Dreyfus Co., Eaton Vance Management Corp. and Franklin Resources.</p>
<p>Mitchell said the bondholders had formed committees and hired her firm to represent them back in February, shortly after FPL sued the partnership to terminate an agreement to buy power from the plants.</p>
<p>&quot;We view the bankruptcy as an opportunity to effectively deal with the FPL litigation,&quot; she said. &quot;This bankruptcy really is about Florida Power &amp; Light. It's not about the long-term health of the projects from a financial point of view.&quot;</p>
<p>FPL officials were not immediately available for comment, but have said previously that power was available at significantly lower costs elsewhere and that its lawsuit was filed to protect customer interests.</p>
