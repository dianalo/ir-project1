<p>Indonesians generally reacted with surprise on Saturday to the Nobel peace prize award to two East Timorese, and with indignation over one of the choices, resistance leader Jose Ramos-Horta.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee on Friday named East Timor's Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo and the Australian-based Ramos-Horta as joint recipients of the 1996 award.</p>
<p>There was no immediate public reaction in East Timor itself, which President Suharto is scheduled to visit next Tuesday to inaugurate several projects.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is calm here. There has been no visible reaction to the bishop winning the Nobel prize. People are just following developments,&quot; a journalist on the Suara Timor Timur (Voice of East Timor) newspaper told Reuters by phone from the capital Dili.</p>
<p>Indonesian newspapers reported the awards without comment, but included in their front-page stories critical comments, particularly about Ramos-Horta. Some newspapers carried front-page photographs of both men.</p>
<p>The exception was the armed forces newspaper, which did not mention the awards. The military has basically been responsible for East Timor, with sometimes brutal effect, since Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in December 1975 and annexed it the following year.</p>
<p>The Nobel committee's decision was highly praised by ex-colonial ruler Portugal, the United States, the United Nations and the Vatican.</p>
<p>But Indonesia condemned the award. Foreign minister Ali Alatas said he was &quot;astounded&quot; Ramos-Horta had won, calling him a &quot;political adventurist&quot;. He had no comment on the outspoken and often fiery Belo.</p>
<p>A senior Asian diplomat said Indonesian officials had expressed suprise and indignation over the awards. Belo might be acceptable, he said, but not Ramos-Horta.</p>
<p>The Nobel committee said on Friday the awards were a recognition of the role played by the two men &quot;towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor&quot;.</p>
<p>It also made clear it had the political aim of spurring &quot;efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict in East Timor based on the people's right to self-determination&quot;.</p>
<p>Dewi Fortuna Anwar, an analyst with the private Centre for Information and Development Studies, told Reuters that Belo was acceptable as &quot;a credible fighter for the betterment of the East Timorese, so I don't think we object to that&quot;.</p>
<p>But she said she was suprised anti-Indonesian leader and spokesman Ramos-Horta was included.</p>
<p>&quot;What he has done so far has not been for the advance of peace. It has just exacerbated tension between the Indonesian government and the local people, and that in fact has delayed the peaceful integration of East Timor,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Anwar and other diplomatic and political analysts said naming Ramos-Horta could have a contrary effect to the Nobel committee's stated purpose, and in fact could perpetuate conflict.</p>
<p>Anwar said there was no question of Indonesia renouncing sovereignty over East Timor, and noted a number of countries had recognised the Indonesian position. The problem was one of human rights and peaceful integration.</p>
<p>Clemintino Amaral, an East Timorese member of the official National Commission on Human Rights, welcomed Belo's prize.</p>
<p>&quot;It is proper as he has struggled for the human rights of the people of East Timor. From the perspective of humanitarianism, we can accept that and I am privately proud,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Amaral said he had reservations, however, over Ramos-Horta.</p>
<p>&quot;From my perspective, up until now, Ramos-Horta's struggle has had a negative effective on the young people of East Timor,&quot; Amaral said.</p>
<p>&quot;Every time he moves, the young people are affected in a bad way. Personally, I think it is not suitable for Ramos-Horta.&quot;</p>
