<p>After a week of solid gains, the dollar is likely to regroup before trying to resume its climb, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>But failure to break through key resistance levels vs. the mark and the yen could bring the bears back and lead to another round of dull consolidation, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar/mark is in a topping out-process,&quot; said Scott Siller, analyst at MCM CurrencyWatch, while noting the &quot;dollar just overshot 1.5165 marks&quot; on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;It may take a week or so, the dollar may trickle higher, but not much higher before it retreats,&quot; Siller predicted.  </p>
<p>In late Friday trade, the dollar was quoted at 1.5140/50 marks vs. 1.5122/27 at the open, and at 110.37/44 yen, virtually unchanged from the morning.</p>
<p>Late in the session, the dollar set its high for the day at 1.5173 marks -- just above the 1.5165 level that Siller said represents a 62-percent retracement of the decline between 1.5485 on May 28 and 1.4635 on July 31.</p>
<p>Still, the MCM CurrencyWatch analyst did not rule out the loss of intermediate support at 1.5090 marks, near term.</p>
<p>&quot;We may dip through 1.5090 or even 1.5065/70, the low on September 11, and maybe get a bounce there,&quot; Siller added.  </p>
<p>A bounce from the 1.5065-, 1.5090-mark area would allow the dollar to test strong resistance at 1.5180 and pave the way for a raid on the daunting 1.5240-mark level.</p>
<p>&quot;There still is room for further improvement, but we are getting signs of a near-term top,&quot; Siller said. &quot;At 1.5240, there is a lot of static resistance up there.&quot;</p>
<p>Dollar/yen looks to have retained more momentum and ready to march to a major resistance at 111.20.</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar/yen could go to 111.20 yen,&quot; said Siller who sees the upside intact unless support at 109.85 is lost. &quot;A move to 110 might be a buy, actually.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Looking at the weekly studies, we have a strong bull channel, with projections to 113.50 yen or so, the last significant peak since we plunged to record lows (79.75 yen on April 19, 1995),&quot; Siller added.</p>
<p>A dollar/yen rally could pull dollar/mark along -- though the two exchange rates do not always move in tandem.</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar/mark and dollar/yen diverge occasionally. Dollar/yen could stay fairly flat and dollar/mark may go lower,&quot; Siller concluded.</p>
