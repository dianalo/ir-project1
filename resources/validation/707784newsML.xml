<p>India's Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) at New Bombay plans to build a chemical terminal and an oil terminal, its chairman R. Vasudevan said.</p>
<p>JNPT is located at a new industrial and residential development on the mainland across the water from its namesake Bombay, which is sited on an island and reclaimed land.</p>
<p>&quot;We are planning a new oil terminal and a chemical terminal at JNPT,&quot; Vasudevan told Reuters late on Thursday.</p>
<p>Vasudevan said JNPT was planning to build a five-berth chemical terminal at an estimated cost of 17.50 billion rupees ($489 million) which would have an annual handling capacity of 16 million tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;For this, global bids will be invited and a lot of foreign companies have shown interest in it,&quot; Vasudevan said. He declined to name the firms.</p>
<p>Vasudevan said JNPT also plans to build an oil terminal at an estimated cost of one billion rupees which would have an annual handling capacity of seven million tonnes of petroleum prroducts.</p>
<p>He said JNPT had received a joint proposal by state-run oil firms Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) for the project. The project has also been recommended by the Petroleum Ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;We have received the feasibility proposal and we have now sought clearance from the Ministry of Environment,&quot; Vasudevan said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will take a decision soon whether we should float tenders for the project or give it to IOC and BPCL,&quot; Vasudevan said. Vasudevan did not give a time frame for both the projects.</p>
