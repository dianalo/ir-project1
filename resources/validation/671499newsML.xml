<p>International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus said momentum for the European Union's planned common currency, the Euro, is strong and he believes it will be launched by January 1999.</p>
<p>Camdessus, speaking to reporters at a briefing, added that even if a delay beyond that date were to occur, it would not mean an end to the process.</p>
<p>&quot;The progression towards EMU (economic and monetary union) is so strong, that even a delay should not derail it.</p>
<p>&quot;But my belief at this stage is that it (delay) will not be necessary and that the Euro will be launched effective January 1999,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If further delay was needed, it wouldn't necessarily be a catastrophe, but the decision should be explained pretty well as well as the next deadline for completing the process,&quot; he said, referring to Europe's ambitious political project.</p>
<p>Camdessus said he welcomed an accord reached this week by France and Germany that kept the Euro on track.</p>
<p>&quot;I see it as a compromise and an extremely constructive one,&quot; he said, referring to the pact which balanced French demands that the European Union make jobs and growth a priority and Germany's insistence on continued fiscal discipline.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a more balanced approach of European policy,&quot; Camdessus said, adding, &quot;I welcome that and I hope it will provide these countries with renewed enthusiasm.&quot;</p>
<p>Later, in a speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, Camdessus discussed the risks associated with large capital inflows into emerging markets, noting that private flows to developing and transition economies reached a record high of $235 billion last year, or about five times the level in 1990.</p>
<p>He said large capital inflows can complicate domestic economic management, pressure exchange rates and can lead to a widening of the current account deficit in some countries.</p>
<p>He said the risks are great in countries where domestic banking systems and supervisions are weak.</p>
<p>&quot;Having seen the state of banking systems around the world, the IMF has pointed to the need for a set of 'best practices' in the financial area that are intentionally recognized and applicable to countries at varying stages of development,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Camdessus said the IMF is also encouraging all countries, especially those tapping, or hoping to tap, international capital markets to improve economic and financial data they provide to the public.</p>
<p>Transparency is one of several ways the IMF is hoping to raise the returns and reduce the risks in global capital markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Better information makes for better investment decisions and fewer market surprises,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Camdessus also said there is movement toward giving the IMF oversight over restrictions on capital movements.</p>
<p>&quot;The emphasis will be on fostering the smooth operation of capital markets,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;this is good for recipient countries, good for investors and good for the world economy.&quot;</p>
