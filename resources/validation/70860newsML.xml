<title>USA: Big B rejects $332 million Revco offer.</title>
<headline>Big B rejects $332 million Revco offer.</headline>
<dateline>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</dateline>
<text>
<p>Big B Inc., the drug store chain, said Monday it has rejected the latest takeover offer from Revco D.S. Inc., calling the $332 million bid inadequate and not in its best interests.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Revco, the nation's largest chain of drug stores, offered $15 a share in cash for the family-owned company after its initial offer in August of $14 per share was turned down.</p>
<p>In the latest twist to the hostile takeover, Big B said it would consider other offers and will explore alternatives to maximize shareholders' value.</p>
<p>Big B has said that it has already received inquiries from other interested parties, who were not identified.</p>
<p>However, Revco said it remains committed to its offer to acquire Big B despite Big B's rejection of the offer and adoption of a shareholder rights plan that would make the deal more difficult to complete.</p>
<p>&quot;We remain committed to completing a combination of Revco and Big B,&quot; Revco said in a statement. &quot;We are confident the shareholders of Big B -- the owners of the company -- will recognise the superior value of our offer.&quot;</p>
<p>Revco said it will review the terms of Big B's rights plan and its board's recommendations to devise future actions.</p>
<p>Big B has approximately 22 million shares on a fully diluted basis, giving Big B a value of $330 million based on Revco's bid.</p>
<p>Revco said it currently owns 1,190 shares of Big B, representing 5.4 percent of Big B's shares on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Big B's board of directors has authorised the company to provide confidential information to interested parties who enter into a confidentiality agreement, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Big B said it has made no decision to sell the company but will consider appropriate offers.</p>
<p>With 397 units throughout the nation's southeastern states, the Bessemer, Ala.-based drug store chain has had a tough time competing in the cost control environment of managed health care and against huge discount retailers.</p>
<p>Big B has been hurt by shrinking profits, and Wall Street analysts say the company has little chance of staying independent.</p>
<p>In a defensive play, Big B also said it has adopted a shareholder rights plan to distribute, as a dividend, one right for each share of common stock held by shareholders of record on Oct. 3.</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, if an individual or group were to acquire 10 percent or more of the company, or otherwise tried to gain control of the company, the rights would allow stockholders to acquire discount shares of common stock.</p>
<p>The rights plan is to expire June 30, 1997, or earlier under circumstances that were not specified.</p>
<p>Big B said Monday that it rejected the offer in part because of advice from Robinson-Humphrey Corp. Inc., its financial adviser, that the bid was financially inadequate.</p>
<p>Big B's stock was up 37.5 cents at $16.625, while Revco was up 12.50 cents at $25.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
