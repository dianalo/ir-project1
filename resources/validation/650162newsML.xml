<p>Russia is making progress in negotiations to join the Paris Club but an agreement may not be reached in time to be announced at next week's Group of Seven summit in Denver, a senior U.S. official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Christian Noyer, the French Treasury director who chairs meetings of the informal group of creditor countries, said last month there were technical issues to be resolved before Russia could join.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not be surprised if they could resolve these by next week, but at this juncture I'm not counting on that happening,&quot; said the U.S. official, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;They seem to be making progress, but whether it can be wrapped up by next week seems iffy (doubtful),&quot; he said. He added: &quot;It'll happen, I think, fairly soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia's entry into the Paris Club would pave the way for negotiations on debt owed by former allies of the the old Soviet Union in Africa and Latin America.</p>
<p>For Russia to join, the Paris Club must decide how to treat that debt and what modern exchange rate to apply to it. Much of the debt was taken out in roubles many years ago.</p>
<p>Russia itself has in recent years reached agreement on rescheduling $40 billion it owed members of the Paris Club, removing a major obstacle to its joining the group.</p>
<p>Russia has also been pressing for membership in a series of institutions that were once the exclusive preserve of the West, including the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>In one measure of its growing integration with the West, Russian President Boris Yeltsin will attend most of the meetings at the annual G7 Denver summit from June 20-22. The G7 members are the United States, Canada, France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Britain.</p>
