<p>General Motor Corp's decision to invest 300 million pounds ($474.9 million) in Vauxhall Motors reflected confidence in its British operation and the international prospects for its Astra model, Vauxhall said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The company said the three-year investment would be used to modernise its Ellesmere Port plant in north-west England, which makes Astra cars and vans.</p>
<p>The announcement, made at the British International Motor Show, guarantees the livelihoods of the 4,200 people employed at the plant and will create at least 200 new jobs.</p>
<p>Vauxhall Motors chairman and managing director Nick Reilly said in an interview that a possible decision on increasing the number of shifts at the plant to three from two could create hundreds more jobs.</p>
<p>Any decision, likely to be taken over the next two years, would depend on the market and demand for the model at that time.</p>
<p>The Astra model has been consistently one of Britain and Europe's top five sellers since its launch five years ago, with the development of an estate model boosting its position.</p>
<p>Reilly said the 300 million pound investment was won against intense competition within GM and reflected the transformation of Ellesmere Port from a domestically-oriented plant to &quot;a very important source of manufacturing within General Motors.&quot;</p>
<p>He predicted strong growth for the Astra in Latin America and Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>Reilly said the British car market is currently &quot;the most competitive in Europe,&quot; with a number of importers using huge U.K. fleet sales as a way of offloading cars which remain unsold in sluggish domestic markets. Europe remained &quot;flat,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said Vauxhall hoped to keep its market share at around 14.5 percent in 1996, and said its profitablity was &quot;going in the right direction&quot; after a tough 1995.</p>
<p>Last year a stagnant car market saw the GM unit's profits slump to three million pounds from 79 million in 1994. ($1=.6317 Pound)</p>
