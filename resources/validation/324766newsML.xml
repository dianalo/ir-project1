<p>This is a particularly good time to get a copy of your credit report, and not just because you are trying to make a fresh start in 1997.</p>
<p>Experian, the company that used to be a part of TRW, has announced it will end its complimentary credit report offer in just over a month. For years, that firm (operating as TRW Information Systems) has been the only credit reporting firm that will give you a freebie if you're not already having credit problems.</p>
<p>So, get one while they are still free.</p>
<p>To get your free credit report from Experian before their offer ends on March 1, 1997, dial 1 800 682-7654 for instructions on how to order the report.</p>
<p>Or write to Experian Complimentary Report, PO Box 8030, Layton, Utah, 84041-8030 with the following information: full name, current address, previous address if you've lived at your current address fewer than five years, Social Security number, year of birth, signature, spouse's first name and a photocopy of some document, such as a utility bill or driver's license, that shows your name and your current address.</p>
<p>If you live in Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts or Vermont, you don't have to rush to get your free Experien report: your state laws require the credit reporting agencies to send you one free report a year.</p>
<p>You can also get a free credit report if you've been turned down for credit recently. Starting next fall, you'll also be able to get free credit reports if you are unemployed and looking for work, on public assistance, or believe that you have been defrauded in a way that would harm your credit rating.</p>
<p>Otherwise, expect to pay a few dollars (usually under $10) to get this report from Experien after March 1, or the other credit reporting agencies, Trans Union Corporation (Consumer Disclosure Centre, PO Box 390, Springfield, Pa. 19064-0390) and Equifax (Information Service Centre, PO Box 740241, Atlanta, Ga. 30374-0241).</p>
<p>What will you find? Probably more open credit accounts than you thought you had. Remember all those store cards you applied for so you could get an extra 10 percent off of your Christmas shopping two years ago? Still there on your report, even if you haven't used them since.</p>
<p>Use this opportunity to cancel every card you still have an active account for that you don't really intend to keep or use. Too many accounts can keep you from qualifying for the card or loan you really want.</p>
<p>You may also find a black mark or two, or some grey, in your credit report. Some department stores, in particular, are infamous for reporting you as soon as your bill is a day or two late. If the bulk of the report looks good, but you've occasionally paid a bill in 30 to 60 days instead of immediately, don't sweat it.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, there are lots of black marks on your credit report, be concerned. These reports are being used more widely than ever: by insurance companies deciding whether or not you are a good risk, by mortgage, car and business lenders, and, in some cases, by prospective employers.</p>
<p>Some credit card companies now use these reports to decide what kind of rate they'll give you on your cards. You don't want to come across as a deadbeat or even a person who pays his bills on time but appears overly dependent on credit.</p>
<p>Decide whether these black marks are mistakes (which can and do happen) or legitimate reflections of your financial style. If the latter, resolve to limit your credit spending while you pay off your bills.</p>
<p>If your credit report includes errors, or you feel you are being unfairly blamed by a lender for a late payment for which you have a good explanation, you can dispute the report with the agency that sent it to you.</p>
<p>If you are into Web browsing, you can get good information for free from each of the three credit reporting agencies. Check out: http://www.experian.com, http://www.tuc.com/ and http://www.equifax.com.</p>
