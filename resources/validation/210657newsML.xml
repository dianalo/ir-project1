<p>Virtually every carrier that flies through Miami International Airport has slapped fuel surcharges on cargo, and base rates have inched up, but despite the higher tariffs, MIA carriers are very busy, a Reuters survey shows.</p>
<p>Fuel surcharges vary from three cents a kilo to 10 cents per kilo and the charge is generally higher for the longer distances.</p>
<p>Although one forwarder said &quot;it seems like they just put on whatever they felt like.&quot;</p>
<p>Many of the surcharges went into effect Oct. 1, and the rest mostly followed effective Nov. 15, forwarders and carriers said.</p>
<p>Because the surcharges are supposed to be temporary, they are not included in the rates quotedthat appear in the chart.</p>
<p>A few carriers raised rates in addition to the fuel surcharge, boosting base rates from MIA to some Latin American destinations.</p>
<p>Thus, the base rate to Sao Paulo increased to $2.05 from $1.90 per kilo in the prior survey. Buenos Aires was up to about $1.98 from $1.90. Bogota was essentially unchanged.</p>
<p>The vacation flights from Europe have eased off, boosting the London rate to $1.20 from the $1.00 of the last survey when holiday charters were still bringing rates down.</p>
<p>All the carriers and forwarders said that despite the higher rates, they are busier than last year at this time.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally our really busy time is the second week in November, but we have been super busy for several weeks now,&quot; one forwarder said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our season started mid-September instead of mid-November,&quot; said Pam Rollins, vice president of Amerijet International, the Fort Lauderdale all-cargo carrier.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect November and December to be very strong,&quot; said Peter Reavely, director of route development at MIA.</p>
<p>Besides the seasonal surge, more textile business is flowing to Central America, said Hymie Sliva, sales manager for the TACA group of Central American airlines which includes TACA, Aviateca, NICA, LASCA and COPA.</p>
<p>&quot;The Central American countries are more politically and economically stable,&quot; said Silva. The garments, called &quot;807 goods,&quot; are cut in the United States and sewn elsewhere and returned to the United States for sale.</p>
<p>Bolivia, which many feel is safer for investment, is privatizing some big industries and cargo is heavier than normal to that country, said one executive. The phone company, now in the in hands of private investors, is using air for many imports, he said.</p>
<p>Some forwarders even complained that Latin American bound frieght is not getting off when it is scheduled to be flown.</p>
<p>&quot;The carriers are overbooking flights,&quot; complained one forwarder, &quot;even when you have a reservation and are confirmed, the freight is not getting on.&quot;</p>
<p>Cargo headed for destinations other than Latin America seems to be moving more smoothly, the forwarder said. &quot;Most of the carriers to Europe are larger and more reliable.&quot;</p>
<p>An executive for one cargo carrier that flies to Latin America explained some delays, &quot;these freighters are not new aircraft and during the busy season, these planes might need unexpected maintenence.&quot;</p>
<p>The passenger carriers have already restricted cargo space. &quot;The first destination restricted is Central America, the luggage is already picking up,&quot; said one cargo manager for a big passenger carrier.</p>
<p>&quot;It is more a matter of space management now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One big player in the Latin American market, all-cargo Millon Air has been grounded during this busy season, shifting some of its business to other carriers.</p>
<p>Millon stopped flying after its Boeing 707 crashed into a town in Ecuador. Scores of people on the ground and the aircraft's crew were killed and dozens more were injured, many badly burned.</p>
<p>Millon carried the ninth most international freight through MIA in the first nine months of 1996, handling 34,309 tons, according to statistics compiled by Dade County Aviation Department.</p>
<p>Millon has leased some aircraft, but could not replace all its lift. And like other MIA operators, it was heavily booked during these busiest weeks for Latin America's cargo hub.</p>
<p>&quot;Somebody has to move their freight,&quot; said Rollins of Amerijet. But forwarders and carriers said it is hard to trace which airlines are handling Millon's cargo.</p>
<p>Millon hopes to be back in the air soon, a Millon executive told Reuters last week, but he could not estimate when that might occur. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017</p>
