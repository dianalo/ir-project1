<headline>FOCUS-German stocks surge, markets await Greenspan.</headline>

<p>European share markets recovered lost ground on Tuesday, with Germany leaping three percent, but few investors elsewhere took big risks before Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan reported on the American economy later in the day.</p>
<p>Bank stocks set the German market alight after news of a big merger in the overcrowded sector, and a strong dollar also helped to reverse the profit-taking of recent days.</p>
<p>But turnover was thin on many other markets as investors waited for the U.S. central bank chief to start his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress at 1800 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is basically as dead as a dodo. Everyone is just waiting for Greenspan,&quot; said a senior dealer at a London stock brokerage.</p>
<p>Markets are fairly confident that Greenspan will not drop any bombshells when he addresses the House of Representatives banking sub-committee on Tuesday and the Senate banking committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p>U.S. inflation seems to be well under control despite a strong economy, meaning interest rates should remain stable for the time being.</p>
<p>But Greenspan can always surprise, as he did last December when he warned investors on Wall Street against irrational exuberance. The comment sent stock markets around the globe tumbling, but not for long.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 16.26 points to 7,906.72 on Monday -- 26 percent higher than its close on December 16, the low point after the Greenspan comments.</p>
<p>Greenspan could make markets jittery if he said strong economic growth could put upward pressure on prices and interest rates later in the year. This would hurt stocks and bonds, but it would support the already strong dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe he will make reference to the exuberance in stocks that he referred to last December, since when the (U.S.) market has gained 25 percent, and he may talk about the outlook for stronger growth,&quot; said one senior stock dealer in London. &quot;But ... providing he's not too severe then the markets will probably be OK.&quot;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the Greenspan jitters, European stock markets took heart from Wall Street's firmer close on Monday after two sessions of heavy profit-taking.</p>
<p>By midday London's FTSE-100 index, which tumbled 143 points in the past two sessions, was up 23.1 points or 0.48 percent at 4,828.8.</p>
<p>Germany excelled with the DAX index surging 123.13 points or 3.0 percent to 4,231.53. Dealers said that the dollar's rise to around 1.81 marks, a level not seen since 1991, boosted stocks of exporters.</p>
<p>Banks also jumped after Monday's news that two of Germany's largest commercial banks, Bayerische Vereinsbank AG and Bayerische Hypobank, would merge.</p>
<p>This encouraged hopes of a consolidation in the banking industry. Commerzbank AG led the way, gaining 6.40 marks or 11.4 percent to 62.50.</p>
<p>Wall Street and the dollar also helped the Paris bourse, which shrugged off Monday's announcement of company tax rises. Investors took a positive view, saying they would help France to qualify for European monetary union by cutting the state deficit closer to the qualifying target.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 was was up 36.68 points or 1.28 percent at 2,910.80 by the early afternoon.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange markets were also waiting for Greenspan, but the dollar still strode to a 71-month high against the mark. &quot;What we saw really was mark weakness rather than anything particularly on the dollar,&quot; said Robert Hayward, an analyst at Bank America.</p>
<p>Dealers said worries that the single European currency would have a large number of founder members and would be weak continued to weigh on the mark. This was fuelled by Monday's announcement of French tax rises and spending cuts which are expected to cut the 1997 budget deficit to around 3.2 percent of GDP, just above the 3.0 percent EMU target.</p>
<p>&quot;The French measures were expected but they provide more ammunition for the market's stubborn belief the euro will be a weaker currency,&quot; said a German bank dealer.</p>
<p>The dollar hit 1.8115 marks but volume was low as the market awaited Greenspan. It was also firm against the yen at 116.28 but failed to hold above last week's high of about 116.50.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1100 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.8115 marks and 116.28 yen, compared with 1.7952 and 115.70 in late trading on Monday.</p>
