<headline>Teens plead not guilty in baby's death.</headline>

<p>Two New Jersey teenagers charged with murdering their newborn baby pleaded not guilty on Tuesday while a defence lawyer questioned the viability of the infant, who was found in a trash bin.</p>
<p>Amy Grossberg and Brian Peterson were denied bail by presiding Delaware Superior Court Judge Henry du Pont Ridgely, 47, who set a trial date of September 9.</p>
<p>He also scheduled another hearing for January 21 at which defence attorneys will argue bail should be granted unless the state can show it has enough evidence to convict the two.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old high school sweethearts have not seen each other since November 12, when authorities said Peterson helped Grossberg deliver a 6-pound (2.7 kilogram), 2-ounce (57 gram) baby boy in a motel room near the University of Delaware campus where Grossberg was a first-year art student.</p>
<p>Later that day police found an infant's corpse in a large trash container behind the motel.</p>
<p>Their secret was discovered when Grossberg of Wyckoff, New Jersey, was admitted to a hospital for a birth-related infection, officials said.</p>
<p>She has been at the Baylor Correctional Institution in New Castle, Delaware since being released from the hospital. Peterson, who was suspended from Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania, has been in the Gander Hill Prison in Wilmington, isolated from the general inmate population.</p>
<p>Before the proceeding began Peterson of Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, glanced tentatively at Grossberg, who looked straight ahead, biting her lip and fighting back tears.</p>
<p>In response to the charges of murder in the first degree and murder by abuse or neglect in the first degree handed up by a grand jury last week, Grossberg's and Peterson's lawyers separately pleaded &quot;Not guilty.&quot;</p>
<p>The arraignment was completed in five minutes. But the hearing continued as lawyers for the defendants argued a series of motions.</p>
<p>An attorney for Peterson, Jack Litman of New York, in asking for expedited discovery of the state's evidence, told Ridgely, &quot;Neither Amy nor Brian intended to cause or did cause any harm to the deceased infant ... or intended to kill the infant.&quot;</p>
<p>Litman then discussed the viability of the infant, saying, &quot;the infant had congenital brain damage which occurred months before the baby came into the world, which seriously compromised&quot; the health of the infant.</p>
<p>He also said Grossberg's &quot;serious medical problems&quot; also compromised the baby health of the baby inside and outside the womb.</p>
<p>Among materials being sought by defence attorneys were tissue slides, photographs, audio recordings made during the autopsy and notes related to the autopsy.</p>
<p>Before the couple was arrested, Delaware Attorney General Jane Brady said she would seek the death penalty for both of them under state law which makes the murder of a child under 14 a capital offence.</p>
