<p>Bonds of United Parcel Service on Wednesday began to feel the pressure of a Teamsters strike entering its 10th day, high-grade traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The 8-3/8 percent bonds had been unchanged since the strike began but are now quoted two (basis points) wider at 43 bid, 40 offer,&quot; said one trader.  </p>
<p>UPS bonds rarely trade and have been widely regarded by market participants as museum pieces because of their AAA credit status. When Teamster drivers and other employees launched the first company-wide strike in history last week, UPS bonds were not expected to suffer significantly because the company's financial profile remained strong.</p>
<p>Bonds of Atlanta-based UPS, the biggest U.S. package delivery service, had been quoted around 41 bid, 39 offer, since the strike began on August 4th.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, however, credit rating agency, Standard &amp; Poor's said it revised UPS' outlook to negative from stable, though it affirmed the company's AAA senior debt rating.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said the outlook revision reflected its concerns regarding the possible negative impact of the strike on the long-term competitive position of UPS.</p>
<p>UPS has said the strike was costing it about $5 million a day in business lost to competitors such as the U.S. Postal Service and Federal Express Corp.  </p>
<p>The rating agency said there was little concern over the near-term financial position as the firm's liquidity is superb, with an unused $4.5 billion bank facility and significant cash balances, and no near-term debt maturities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, United Parcel Service chief executive officer James Kelly said Wednesday that talks with the Teamsters were at an impasse.</p>
<p>&quot;I would characterize them as being at an impasse,&quot; he told Cable News Network when asked about the negotiations.</p>
<p>UPS, with 1996 revenues of $22.4 billion, handles 3.15 billion parcels and documents, shipped annually to countries around the world.</p>
