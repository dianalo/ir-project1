<p>PALM OIL FUTURES - Extended losses on weak fundamentals and weaker Chicago soyoil futures overnight. Falls limited by a weak ringgit against U.S. dollar. Seen steady unless ringgit strenghtens. Support for Oct futures pegged at 1,140 ringgit.</p>
<p>PALM OIL PHYSICALS - Also recovered from lows on ringgit's fall. Activity again focussed on nearby crude palm oil and RBD palm olein.  </p>
<p>The ringgit was at 2.6370 to a dollar at 1000 GMT, against its close of 2.6230 in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A weak ringgit is seen as a supportive factor for the palm oil export market, which traded mostly in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>Local palm oil prices were expected to hold steady if the ringgit stayed weak, they said. Immediate support for third position contract is pegged at 1,140 ringgit.</p>
<p>Weak fundamentals and overnight losses in Chicago soyoil futures had pressured prices earlier.  </p>
<p>Traders said concern about rising stocks continued to cloud the market. They said production remained robust and offtake was not sufficient to keep stocks from piling up.</p>
<p>Private crop forecaster Ivan Wong has estimated stocks to reach 1.06 million tonnes by end-September. For end-July, he forecast stocks at 865,000-875,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Official figures from the Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority (PORLA) placed stocks at the end of June at 786,123 tonnes.</p>
