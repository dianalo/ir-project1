<p>The Italian cabinet will review on Friday the problem of thousands of teachers suddenly seeking early retirement, Minister for Equal Opportunities Anna Finocchiaro said.</p>
<p>Newspapers reported on Wednesday that the government intended to introduce a temporary block on early retirement in schools after receiving requests from some 65,000 teachers in the last few months to quit the profession.</p>
<p>&quot;We did not talk about this today. It will be examined on Friday,&quot; Finocchiaro said at the end of Wednesday's cabinet.</p>
<p>Newspapers said the government was planning to allow only people who had worked for at least 35 years to go into retirement. Everyone else will have to wait for up to a year before drawing a pension, the reports added.</p>
<p>Italian state pensions body Inps has reported a recent surge in people seeking early retirement across various sectors as worries rise that the government might crack down on pension benefits.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi started talks with union leaders on Tuesday over a reform of the welfare state with economists urging a cutdown on overall pension spending.</p>
<p>Wednesday's cabinet reviewed administrative plans for the agriculture sector. -- Rome newsroom +396 6782501</p>
