<text>
<p>Algerian President Liamine Zeroual on Monday signed into law the 1997 state budget, which envisages a deficit of 84.7 billion dinars ($1.54 billion) against a forecast provisional deficit of 31.5 billion dinars in 1996.</p>
<p>The official Algerian news agency APS said Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia and the government-appointed Transitional National Council speaker Abdelkader Bensalah were among officials who attended the signing ceremony.</p>
<p>The budget forecasts receipts of 829.4 billion dinars, an increase of 19.3 billion dinars over 1996, against expenditure of 914.1 billion dinars, up 72.5 billion dinars on the 1996 budget, official figures showed.</p>
<p>Officials expect to wind up the 1996 actual budget with a slight surplus because of higher-than-expected oil income and a good harvest. Ouyahia is expected to give final details on the 1996 budget results early in January.</p>
<p>For the 1997 budget, taxes from the gas and oil sectors provide more than half the envisaged receipts, at 451 billion dinars, slightly down from last year's 485.6 billion taxes drawn from hydrocarbon sales, the official data showed.</p>
<p>The government used a figure of an average $17.50 per barrel for crude oil sales in 1997 against $16.50 per barrel in 1996.</p>
<p>Crude oil prices in the international market hovered around an average $22 per barrel in 1996 for Algerian oil exports, bringing a windfall to the violence-torn North African country's economy.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry has said the budget aims to stimulate investment and improve production through fiscal incentives, including putting many companies on the lowest rate, seven percent, for Value Added Tax.</p>
<p>More than 100 billion dinars of the budget is to be devoted to modernising Algeria's ailing non-oil and gas industry which had swallowed more than 650 billion dinars in subsidies from the state in the past six years.</p>
<p>State-owned non-oil and gas industry production fell by 7.4 percent in the first half of 1996 as the industry sought to recover from ineffective management under nearly three decades of a centrally controlled economy.</p>
<p>The government since 1995 has been striving to shift the economy to a free market under a three-year accord with the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>The prime minister said on Sunday the inflation rate fell to 16.5 percent at the end of 1996 from 29 percent in the previous year and would be no more than 10 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>The bank interest rate was down to 15 percent at the end of 1996 from 18.5 percent in 1995, which he said would foster investment from both private and state-owned sectors.</p>
<p>The economy's reforms began yielding first results with more than four percent gross domestic growth in the first half of 1996, the same rate for the whole of the previous year, reversing successive falls in 1993 and 1994.</p>
<p>Algerian authorities have been confronting a five-year-old conflict with radical Moslem fundamentalists whose ranks, according to officials, have been reinforced in the last years by young people frustated by a 28 percent unemployment rate and a chronic housing shortage.</p>
<p>About 60,000 people have been killed in Algeria's violence since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a huge lead.</p>
