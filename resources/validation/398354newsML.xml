<p>In the third major change of ownership on Switzerland's private asset management scene in a month, a Malaysian conglomerate will buy the Geneva private bank  Banque Financiere de la Cite SA (BFC), a bank official said.</p>
<p>Andre Hintermann, president of BFC, told the Swiss news agency ATS that the acquisition by the Malaysia's George Town Holdings would be completed this year. The group will also acquire BFC's offshore operation based in the Cayman islands.</p>
<p>ATS put the value of the deal at 45 million Swiss Francs.  </p>
<p>Hintermann said Switzerland's Holding Financier de la Cite (HFC), which controlled the two banks, decided to sell its stake in order to concentrate on its core real estate business and get out of banking.</p>
<p>He said no lay-offs were foreseen for BFC's 25 staff. The bank does not publish the volume of assets it manages.</p>
<p>Swiss bankers say tough competition and worries over fee erosion is likely to prompt more mergers and acquisitions in Switzerland's private banking industry, where assets under management are estimated at $1.8 trillion.</p>
<p>On February 13, Geneva private banks Banque D'Investissements Prives (BIP) and Compagnie Bancaire Geneve (CBG) announced a merger plan to join forces against competition in a deal put at more than 50 million Swiss Francs by bankers.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, U.S. brokerage house Lehman Brothers sold its fully-owned Swiss private bank in Geneva to Vancouver-based Canadian asset management and financial services group MFC Financial Corp for an undisclosed sum.</p>
