<p>LaserSight Inc said Thursday it expects to report a first-quarter loss of between $550,000 and $700,000 or $0.06 to $0.08 per share compared to the 1996 first-quarter loss of $1.2 million or $0.19 a share.</p>
<p>The company said it would report progress in turning around its technology segment while reporting membership and revenue growth with existing contracts in its managed vision care segment.  </p>
<p>LaserSight said first-quarter revenues are estimated to be $6.5 million, about 40 percent higher than the $4.6 million in revenues reported during the 1996 first quarter.</p>
<p>Besides favorable prior-year comparisons, quarter-to-quarter comparisons beginning in the third quarter of 1996 also are favorable, the company said. Revenues have increased while gross profit margins have been maintained, operating expenses are declining and net income improving, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Steps we took last year to improve cash flow and strengthen operations are working,&quot; president Michael Farris said in a statement. &quot;During the first quarter, we sold 15 laser systems with zero system returns. If we had sold 20 systens, two systems less than the number of systems sold in the fourth quarter not counting returns, we would have reported a profit.&quot;</p>
<p>LaserSight is engaged in manufacturing lasers, third-party managed vision care administration and ophthalmic practice management.</p>
