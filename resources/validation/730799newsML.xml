<p>The start-up of Japan's 52nd commercial nuclear reactor this month -- the last planned for this century -- marks a milestone in this island nation's battle to cut its dependence on imported oil, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But a near five-year gap between this launch and the next scheduled reactor in 2002 reflects Japan's dilemma in staking its future on a technology surrounded by political opposition and environmental risks.</p>
<p>The new 1.18 million kilowatt (KW) Kyushu Electric Power Co reactor, set to start sales of electricity on July 25 in the major southwestern island of Kyushu, will be the 19th new commercial reactor to go on line in Japan since 1987 and the 39th to feed Japan's ravenous power grid since 1977.</p>
<p>Experts agree that Japan's heated pace in building new plants -- about two new reactors coming on line each year over the last two decades and an effective quadrupling in the number of Japan's commercially viable reactors in the same timeframe -- testifies to Tokyo's commitment to nuclear power.</p>
<p>But the same experts say the future of new construction in Japan is far less clear, largely because of the difficulty in funding and locating sites for new capacity.</p>
<p>&quot;The absence of new facilities coming on line in the next four years can be generally explained by (the 1986 explosion at the Soviet facility of) Chernobyl,&quot; said Shunsuke Kondo, a member of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
<p>New nuclear facilities can take seven to 10 years to complete on average, meaning that the global nuclear policy shake-up which followed Chernobyl in the late 1980s is only now taking its toll on actual reactor start-ups.</p>
<p>&quot;But any difficulty in creating new capacity after 2002 will be in finding new sites for the facilities,&quot; Kondo added.</p>
<p>Japan plans some 23 gigawatts of new capacity -- or $50 billion to $80 billion worth -- atop its current 40 gigawatts by 2010, a target widely believed to be overly optimistic because of the heavy financial burden involved.</p>
<p>&quot;These projections are an impossibility,&quot; said Jinzaburo Takagi, executive director of Japan's Citizens' Nuclear Information Centre.</p>
<p>&quot;New capacity will likely have to be created by expanding existing sites, because the Japanese public's growing aversion to new facilities will make identifying new sites increasingly difficult,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Two years of repeated nuclear mishaps and cover-ups in Japan have led to a change in public attitudes toward nuclear energy and a growing outcry from communities unwilling to embrace new facilities in their own backyard.</p>
<p>Just last week Japan's Chubu Electric Power Co said it was halting development of a 2.7 million KW nuclear power plant project in central Japan until the end of 1999 because of safety concerns voiced by one of the towns bordering the facility.</p>
<p>And earlier this month, intense local public protests accompanied the start-up of Tokyo Electric Power Co's (TEPCO) newest reactor in northern Japan.</p>
<p>The reactor, which made TEPCO's seven-reactor facility the world's largest, rekindled public concern over Japan's growing stockpile of spent nuclear fuel.</p>
<p>Japan's next new reactor, a Tohoku Electric Power Co reactor, is slated to begin commercial operations in January 2002.</p>
