<p>India must agree to discuss the future of divided Kashmir with Pakistan for bilateral ties to improve, Islamabad's ambassador to New Delhi said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>High Commissioner Ashraf Jehangir Qazi said his country had high hopes for peace talks which were launched in March and will resume next week when the two nations' prime ministers meet on the fringes of a regional summit in the Maldives.</p>
<p>But progress will be slow, and Islamabad will not allow the normalisation of relations unless the half-century quarrel over the Himalayan region of Kashmir is addressed concurrently with other issues, Qazi said.</p>
<p>&quot;This time things are looking relatively good. Without minimising the difficulties in normalising relations, the mood is very positive,&quot; Qazi, who recently took up his post in Delhi, told the Foreign Correspondents' Club in the Indian capital.</p>
<p>&quot;People want to find a way forward. The (Pakistani) government is committed to giving its best shot to this dialogue,&quot; said Qazi, a five-time ambassador who has served as his nation's top envoy in Syria, Germany, Russia and China.</p>
<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart, Inder Kumar Gujral, are set to hold talks next Monday ahead of a meeting of the leaders of the seven-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).</p>
<p>The South Asian neighbours, which have fought three wars since independence, resumed talks in March after a three-year hiatus marked by bitter recriminations and a separatist insurgency in the two-thirds of Kashmir ruled by India.</p>
<p>Gujral met Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan last month before becoming prime minister in a political shakeup.</p>
<p>Qazi said the tete-a-tete between Gujral and Sharif, their first as prime ministers, would be a &quot;courtesy meeting&quot; that could lead to the scheduling of a second round of talks between the nations' foreign secretaries, either in late May or June.</p>
<p>The Pakistani diplomat said his country would not allow Kashmir -- the cause of two of the three wars between India and Pakistan -- to be overlooked while negotiations moved forward in other areas such as trade.</p>
<p>&quot;For us, Kashmir is the core problem. Even if you put something on the back-burner or under the carpet or in cold storage, there is something. What is it? That something is the problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless we are able to get down and constructively address this core issue, trade and other issues won't be able to be normalised.&quot;</p>
<p>The envoy reiterated his government's longstanding attachment to United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for a referendum of Kashmiris to determine whether the region would join India or Pakistan.</p>
<p>He also played down expectations of quick progress.</p>
<p>&quot;We realise this is going to take a long time for us to begin to narrow down the differences. At the same time we are looking towards exploring the opportunities for greater cooperation in other fields,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Qazi said Pakistan generally favoured increased two-way trade, currently estimated at about $1.5 billion a year, including black market commerce.</p>
<p>But before offering India most favoured nation status, Islamabad wanted to study the impact that liberalised trade would have on its industries and examine India's tariffs and export subsidies, he said.</p>
