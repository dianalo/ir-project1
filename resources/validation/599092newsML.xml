<title>USA: U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS -- Fed watch continues.</title>
<headline>U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS -- Fed watch continues.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. municipal bonds marked time Tuesday as players waited to see whether Federal Reserve policy makers would raise short-term interest rates.</p>
<p>One trader said while he sold some bonds at slightly better levels than where they came a few days ago, the Fed watch was stifling action.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything that has taken place is against an order, and it's mostly wirehouses buying just so they have inventory for the retail (customer),&quot; the trader said. &quot;There is very little Street playing going on at all.&quot;</p>
<p>While some players expected today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting to yield a 25 basis point hike in short-term rates, just as many expect no change, market players said. An announcement is expected at 1415 EDT.</p>
<p>&quot;I just think that there is more downside potential than upside,&quot; one trader said. If they don't change, maybe that's built into the market, and they sell it. If they bump it, it's just going to give a reason to sell.&quot;</p>
<p>The trader said the potential for a 7.0 percent long U.S. Treasury bond appears much more likely than the potential for a 6.75 percent bond.</p>
<p>&quot;And I think that seems to be the feeling throughout most of the street right now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the government market, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 5/32 at 96-4/32 to yield 6.93 percent. In debt futures, the June municipal contract was down 3/32 at 116-14/32. The June T-bond contract was down 9/32 at 109-20/32. The MOB spread was 218 ticks.</p>
<p>Tuesday's actively quoted municipal issues included Oregon State Department of Administrative Services 5.8 percent certificates were bid at 99-3/4, down from Monday's closing dollar price of 100.</p>
<p>Turning to new issues, Nevada is expected to sell $285 million of general obligation bonds via competitive bidding at 1030 EDT on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On the negotiated side, New York City is expected to sell about $740 million of GOs Wednesday via Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>The City on Monday sold $63 million of bonds to retail investors during the second day of a presale order period, bringing the total so far to $133 million.</p>
