<headline>PLO official warns of settler acts against peace.</headline>
<dateline>AMMAN 1996-12-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Top Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas said on Wednesday that Jewish settlers were planning to derail progress in ongoing Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the settlers to undertake acts to obstruct the peace process and we have to be alert as should the Israeli government because this obstructs the peace process,&quot; Abbas was quoted by the Jordan's state news agency Petra as saying after meeting Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti in Amman.</p>
<p>Israeli security forces chased on Wednesday Jewish settlers across Hebron rooftops to break up a protest against an imminent deal to hand over most of the West Bank town to Palestinians.</p>
<p>Jewish settlers in Hebron are angry that a U.S.-brokered Israeli-PLO summit made progress on Tuesday towards a long-overdue Israeli transfer to the Palestinian Authority of 80 percent of the volatile town holy to Moslems and Jews.</p>
<p>Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, on a short visit to brief Kabariti on progress in the talks, told Petra that Jewish settlers &quot;believe that an accord over Hebron would limit the freedom they got in the past period&quot;.</p>
<p>The 400 settlers in the heart of the town of 100,000 Arabs fear Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu will risk their security if he signs the deal within a week as both sides predict.</p>
<p>Abu Mazen confirmed that an agreement would be signed within a week on &quot;Israeli withdrawal from Hebron and resumption of implementing the other post-Hebron accords in order to reach the final status stage.&quot;</p>
<p>Abu Mazen also predicted that negotiating teams, who resumed talks in Jerusalem on Wednesday joined by U.S. special Middle East envoy Dennis Ross, would make new progress in the next 48 hours &quot;on some of the existing issues&quot;.</p>
<p>But no accord could last without creating mutual trust between the two sides, the Palestinian official warned.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever the measures the Israelis take, they will not be useful and the situation will become more difficult if trust is not present...mutual trust is more important than all this and if trust and good treatment is found, then relations will be normal between us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Israel cites security fears for its delay in transfering Hebron to Palestinian self-rule under a 1995 peace deal. It was occupied by Israel with the rest of the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
