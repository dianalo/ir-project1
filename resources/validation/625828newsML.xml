<p>Bosnian Suad Katana and Ghanaian international Yaw Preko were pronounced fit on Friday and ready to play for Anderlecht in Sunday's Belgian Cup final against Ekeren.</p>
<p>Katana, who suffered a thigh injury earlier this week, was badly needed to shore up Anderlecht's defence against in-form Ekeren, scorers of 21 goals in their last five league games -- all of them victories.</p>
<p>The recovery of Preko, who received a calf injury playing for Ghana in a World Cup qualifier against Gabon last month, also sparked a sigh of relief at Anderlecht, whose main striker Gilles De Bilde left in mid-season.</p>
<p>Six other regulars nursing injuries earlier this week, including goalkeeper Geert De Vlieger, were also available, team doctor Raymond Edelman said.</p>
<p>Bosnian midfielder Cvijan Milosevic and Hungarian defender Ervin Kovacs had resumed normal training at Ekeren.</p>
<p>Milosevic had been out for a week with a groin problem and Kovacs was sidelined with a calf injury for three weeks.</p>
<p>Ekeren only miss suspended defender Nick Descamps.</p>
