<p>British birds are starting to lay their eggs more than a week earlier than before, probably owing to global warming, experts reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said their findings added to evidence that global warming was affecting plants and animals alike.</p>
<p>Humphrey Crick and colleagues at the National Centre for Ornithology in Thetford studied records going back to 1975. Every year 1,000 volunteer bird-watchers keep a close account of when and where birds lay their eggs.</p>
<p>&quot;We found significant trends towards earlier laying dates for 20 species,&quot; they wrote in a letter to the science journal Nature.</p>
<p>Some species set up house 17 days earlier while some had just moved their dates forward by four days, Crick's group said. The average was 8.8 days.</p>
<p>In April, researchers at Boston University in the United States said the growing season for plants in the northern hemisphere had moved forward by about a week.</p>
<p>Crick's group said laying eggs a week early could be an advantage for birds if it gave their young more time to grow before winter. But it could be a disadvantage if food supplies, such as plants or insects, were not seeing the same changes at the same time.</p>
