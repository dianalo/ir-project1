<p>Rights campaigners and political analysts have dismissed assertions by Turkey and its close ally the United States that the country is at last tackling its poor human rights record.</p>
<p>Rights workers at home and abroad say the most recent reforms, announced by the Foreign Ministry last week, are little more than another sop to Western Europe, where concern for abuses has limited integration with its big eastern neighbour.</p>
<p>And they say that while the number of torture cases reported has dropped, &quot;disappearances&quot; and extrajudicial killings remain high despite repeated government promises of reform.</p>
<p>Turkey also leads the world, for the third year running, in the number of journalists behind bars, according to the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been no improvement in the human rights situation in Turkey,&quot; Akin Birdal, chairman of the independent Human Rights Association, told Reuters at the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever the European Union puts pressure on Turkey over human rights, (Foreign Minister) Tansu Ciller mentions a package of reforms and then nothing happens,&quot; said Birdal, mirroring the comments of a number of rights workers and Western diplomats.</p>
<p>The Association says 114 people &quot;disappeared&quot; in the second half of 1996. Police say many were &quot;terrorists&quot; who went underground.</p>
<p>The European Parliament has blocked millions of dollars in aid to Turkey, largely as a result of its rights record.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, EU centrist and Christian Democratic leaders said Turkey did not have the requisite &quot;cultural&quot; values to join the Union. Overwhelmingly Moslem Turkey charged that the EU was a &quot;Christian club&quot; intent on staying that way.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Foreign Minister Ciller effectively admitted that abuse of prisoners was common but said she would tour police stations and personally put a stop to it.</p>
<p>&quot;Any act that we consider inhuman, be it the 'Palestinian hook', electrical shocks, or any other form of torture, cannot be perpetrated in our police stations,&quot; Ciller said.</p>
<p>The president's office also announced final approval of a change in the detention laws, reducing the time a prisoner can be held in custody without charges -- a time, rights experts say, when a suspect is most at risk of torture or even death.</p>
<p>The moves won quick praise from Paris, which said human rights improvements should bring Turkey closer to its goal of eventual membership in the European Union.</p>
<p>The United States, Turkey's steadfast patron and ally, said last week the reforms deserved &quot;high marks&quot; from Europe and it urged the EU not to close the door to Turkish membership.</p>
<p>On the ground, however, the picture is not so clear cut.</p>
<p>Amnesty International called the new measures, which still allow authorities to hold prisoners incommunicado for days, unlikely to deter torture. Turkish political analysts ridiculed the renewed rights push as lacking in credibility.</p>
<p>&quot;Ciller saying she is going to investigate police stations in order to remove torture devices is unbelievable,&quot; said commentator Bilal Cetin.</p>
<p>&quot;She has been in power since 1991 -- as prime minister or in the cabinet -- so she is now admitting there was torture during her tenure,&quot; Cetin told Reuters. &quot;Which democracy package is this, what number? How many more will there be?&quot;</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1995, Turkey amended its Anti-Terror Law to ease restrictions on freedom of expression. However, the country's jails today hold 78 journalists, tops in the world for the third consecutive year.</p>
<p>A year later, Ciller promised the Europeans to introduce human rights &quot;of the highest international standards&quot;. However, major rights reports, including the latest from the U.S. State Department, show no improvement and even some deterioration.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot see any evidence things have changed for the better,&quot; said Vincent McGee, vice chairman of the Human Rights Watch Arms Project's advisory committee.</p>
<p>&quot;In reality, there has not been any continuity of positive results,&quot; he said.</p>
