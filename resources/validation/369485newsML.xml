<p>The private sector is planning to set up a third brewery in Egypt, where there is a market opportunity for improved-quality beer after decades of state monopoly, a private-sector executive said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Construction (of the brewery) will start by the end of this year,&quot; chairman of the Egyptian Finance Company (EFC), Farid Wadie Saad, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Saad, whose company has a licence to set up a plant, declined to say what capacity his brewery would have, saying engineering studies now under way would decide this.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign partnership or technical assistance are possibilities,&quot; he said, but he declined to name any potential partners. &quot;But we will not make, for instance, German beer without (German) partnership,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Egyptian private firm Orascom is also planning to brew beer, in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada, in a partnership with Germany's Loewenbraeu.</p>
<p>EFC's plant will target &quot;a substantial portion of the existing and potential local market&quot;, Saad said. &quot;But we also hope to export.&quot;</p>
<p>Saad said the new brewery's target would include foreign tourists to Egypt. &quot;They are reported to complain about the existing beer quality,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to render a service to tourism in Egypt.&quot;</p>
<p>Domestic output is currently about 400,000 hectolitres, which is supplied by al-Ahram Beverages, the only existing brewer.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based Luxor Group bought 75 percent or 3.37 million shares of al-Ahram, also known as Pyramids Breweries, from the Egyptian government last year in a deal worth 231 million pounds ($70 million). EFC was among the bidders.</p>
<p>The state-owned Holding Company for Housing and Tourism has said that Luxor is committed to invest 221 million pounds. Sources close to the deal said that Danish brewers Carlsberg will technically revamp the firm and that it might produce beer in Egypt under licence. Carlsberg has said cooperation is a possibility but nothing has been decided.</p>
<p>Luxor will transform 70 percent of its holdings into a global depositary receipt, the agent for the offer has said.</p>
