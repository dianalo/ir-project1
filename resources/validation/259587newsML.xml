<p>The British opposition Labour Party's chief parliamentary manager Donald Dewar said on Monday the party may put down a motion of no confidence in the government if Prime Minister John Major loses a Commons vote later on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we will meet that when we come to it. But it is certainly a possibility,&quot; Dewar told reporters.  </p>
<p>Dewar said, however, he was not certain of winning Monday night's vote on fisheries policy.</p>
<p>The government lost a similar vote last year but ignored the result. However, the government has lost its majority and is now on level pegging with all the opposition parties.</p>
<p>&quot;It's up to the smaller parties. If they support us, then it will be very close,&quot; Dewar said. Some of the smaller parties, in particular those from Northern Ireland, have been demanding concessions from the government in return for their support.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe (the government) is time exhausted, time expired and it is in the public interest that it should go,&quot; he said.</p>
