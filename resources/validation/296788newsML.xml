<p>Tamil Tiger rebels attacked a key northern Sri Lanka government-held town but were repulsed after suffering some 500 dead or wounded in the fiercest battle since September, the Defence Ministry and military officials said.</p>
<p>The fighting raged for most of the day after a pre-dawn rebel raid on Paranthan, a Defence Ministry statement said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The ministry said 500 rebels were killed or wounded. Nine government soldiers were killed and 232 wounded, it added.</p>
<p>A Paris-based spokesmen for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) denied the government's assessment but did not give further details.</p>
<p>&quot;The figure of our own troops killed in action is likely to increase as the search is still going on,&quot; the ministry statement said. The fighting had mostly ended by the late afternoon, military officials said.</p>
<p>The military rushed aircraft and reinforcements to Paranthan, on the mainland just south of the Jaffna peninsula, military officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Tigers overran part of our FDL (forward defended locality),&quot; a senior military official told Reuters. &quot;Two gun positions came under very heavy attack and the guns were destroyed by our troops to prevent them from falling into enemy hands.&quot;</p>
<p>The Defence Ministry said soldiers had repulsed the raid and the LTTE guerrillas were withdrawing.</p>
<p>&quot;Troops prevented the LTTE from taking any guns,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Defence analysts said the Tigers had been trying for a long time to acquire long-range artillery in their effort to tip the military balance in their favour.</p>
<p>Last July, the rebels overran the northeastern Mullaitivu army base, killing or capturing more than 1,000 government troops and dealing the military its biggest blow in the war, now in its 14th year.</p>
<p>Two 120 mm artillery pieces and two 120 mm mortars captured in the Mullaitivu raid were believed to have been used in Thursday's fighting, the heaviest since the battle for the town of Kilinochchi last September, military officials said.</p>
<p>The Tigers used human-wave tactics and suicide bombers to overrun defences at Paranthan, a junction town 280 km (185 miles) north of the capital Colombo, in the new year's first major battle, the officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The area had fallen to the enemy for a little while but it has now been recaptured,&quot; another military official said.</p>
<p>The ministry said soldiers from the nearby Elephant Pass base, about nine km (six miles) to the north on the neck of the Jaffna peninsula, linked up with the defenders of Paranthan around 3.30 p.m. (0930 GMT).</p>
<p>Bodies of soldiers and rebels were seen in several places as army reinforcements, backed by air force helicopter gunships, were assessing battle damage, other military officials said.</p>
<p>A large number of guerrillas had penetrated the town's defences shortly after midnight and bombarded its military positions with artillery and mortars, they said.</p>
<p>Paranthan sits astride the main north-south highway from Colombo to Jaffna and controls the road junction connecting to the rebel-held northeastern town of Mullaitivu.</p>
<p>Government forces, which captured Paranthan from the rebels last July, pushed further into LTTE territory and took control of Kilinochchi in August, the last major town controlled by the rebels.</p>
<p>The LTTE, which is fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in this predominantly Sinhalese Indian Ocean island, were driven out of their Jaffna peninsula stronghold by government forces in April last year.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the war. The LTTE says the toll is much higher.</p>
