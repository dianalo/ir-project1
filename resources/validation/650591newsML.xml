<p>Chrysler Corp. said Tuesday it would make 180,000 minivans that can run on either gasoline or ethanol, the second major automaker in a week to unveil a large-scale alternative fuel vehicle programme.</p>
<p>The vehicles will be available starting in the 1998 model year, which begins this autumn, a Chrysler official said at the Governors' Ethanol Coalition Conference.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. said last week it plans to produce 250,000 flexible-fuel pickup trucks, sedans and minivans starting in the 1998 for the 1999 model year. Ford plans to spend about $300 per vehicle so they can run on gasoline or a mixture of gasoline and ethanol, alcohol made from corn and grains that burns cleaner than gasoline but is less fuel-efficient.</p>
<p>General Motors Corp., the world's largest automaker, offers a limited number of alternative fuel vehicles but has not announced a large-scale production programme.</p>
<p>The Chrysler official would not comment on how much it will cost the nation's third largest automaker to adapt the flexible-fuel technology, but he said it will not affect the retail price of the minivans.</p>
<p>Chrysler said flexible-fuel minivans that run on E85 -- a combination of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline -- will get about 33 percent fewer miles per gallon than minivans that run on gasoline.</p>
<p>All of Chrysler's 1998 Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town and Country minivans that come with the standard 3.3-litre, six-cylinder engine will be able to run on either fuel.</p>
<p>The metallic blue minivan unveiled Tuesday looked similar to other Chrysler vans, except that it had the word &quot;Ethanol&quot; emblazoned on its side. The logo will not appear on vehicles sold to the public, officials said.</p>
<p>Bill Rotramel, a Chrysler spokesman at the unveiling, said that in addition to helping the enivronment, flexible-fuel vehicles helped lower U.S. dependence on oil imports.</p>
<p>Chrysler will manufacture the vehicles at its assembly plants in Windsor, Ontario, and in Fenton, Mo.</p>
<p>Members of the National Corn Growers Association and officials from corn-growing states welcomed Chrysler's move.</p>
<p>&quot;If 250,000 of these vehicles used as little as 100 gallons each year of E85, that would produce a market for 25 million gallons of ethanol or about 10 million bushels of corn,&quot; NCGA Vice President Ryland Utlaut said.</p>
<p>Chrysler officials said little about the federal fuel credits automakers receive for offering flexible-fuel vehicles. Such credits allow automakers to raise their corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE. That, in turn, allows them to sell more of the highly profitable -- but less fuel-efficient -- pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.</p>
<p>The federal government sets CAFE limits to force automakers to offer a certain number of fuel-efficient vehicles.</p>
<p>Rotramel said Chrysler will benefit from the credits obtained from the ethanol programme, but he declined to give the number of CAFE credits Chrysler will get for each one sold.</p>
<p>At present only about 40 gas stations across the country offer E85 to the public, but an ethanol industry official said more stations would be added this year and next.</p>
<p>Chrysler stock added 12.5 cents to $33 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
