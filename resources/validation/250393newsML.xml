<p>Switzerland's parliament gave final approval on Wednesday to speeding ahead with a sweeping study of Swiss financial dealings with Nazi Germany and the fate of Jewish wealth stashed in Swiss banks during the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Both houses of parliament waived the normal three-month waiting period for laws to take force, allowing a panel of independent historians and financial and legal experts to begin their probe of Switzerland's wartime role early next year.</p>
<p>The group, still to be named, will be empowered to lift tight banking secrecy rules for an historical accounting of Swiss commerce with Nazi Germany. Swiss purchases of Nazi gold were a crucial source of funds to finance the German war effort.</p>
<p>It will also review how much wealth was deposited with Swiss banks and finance companies by Jews and other victims of Nazi persecution and whether the Swiss have done enough to identify the lost assets of those killed in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>The commission, expected to start work next month and wrap up its work within five years, will have full access to bank archives from the war era, but bank secrecy will not be lifted from modern accounts.</p>
<p>The government decree approved by parliament followed accusations by foreign critics that Switzerland could still be hoarding Nazi gold or holding millions of dollars in dormant assets of people who perished during Hitler's reign of terror.</p>
<p>A foreign ministry spokesman said officials were trying to identify panel members before the cabinet meets for the last time this year next Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are fully involved in talking with potential candidates, but it is still open whether we can finish by next week,&quot; he said. &quot;The goal is to have them start work by January.&quot;</p>
<p>A Swiss historian will chair the commission, likely to have seven members and include two or three foreigners as well as representatives of Jewish groups.</p>
<p>Parliament's upper chamber paved the way to passage on Monday by withdrawing a controversial amendment giving people who feared being identified in the study the right to ask the Swiss high court to block their names from being published.</p>
<p>Critics, including the head of the Swiss Jewish Federation, had said the amendment would create the impression of a cover-up by allowing individuals to hide their names in the final report.</p>
<p>The commission is separate from an international panel set up by Swiss banks and world Jewish groups last May to search for any lost Holocaust accounts and help return the assets to their rightful owners.</p>
<p>The government says it wants to await the results of these probes before deciding whether to approve calls by some Jewish leaders for Switzerland to make a significant financial gesture to Holocaust victims, many of whom will not live five more years.</p>
