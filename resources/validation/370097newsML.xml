<p>American Airlines and its pilots resumed talks Tuesday to avert a strike set for midnight Friday that would shut down the second biggest U.S. carrier and disrupt plans for hundreds of thousands travelers.</p>
<p>The contract negotiations, under the guidance of the National Mediation Board, opened on Monday with American and the Allied Pilots Association both saying their aim was to reach a deal.</p>
<p>Mediators described the initial session in a downtown hotel on Monday as &quot;businesslike, very serious.&quot;</p>
<p>In shuttle negotiations Tuesday, the two sides met separately and then with mediators, who were trying to bring management and the pilots to an agreement to avert a strike.</p>
<p>The union, representing 9,300 pilots, is seeking an 11.5 percent pay raise and stock options. American, a unit of Fort Worth, Tex.-based AMR Corp., has offered 5 percent.</p>
<p>Also at issue is American's plan to add jets to its regional carrier American Eagle and use lower-paid pilots in another union to fly them.  The APA wants its members to fly those planes.</p>
<p>But American said it needed lower paid pilots at American Eagle to better compete with other low-cost regional carriers.</p>
<p>The pilots have said that without a new contract, they would strike at 0001 EST (0501 GMT) on Saturday. American typically carries about 200,000 passengers on 2,200 routes worldwide every day.</p>
<p>American has said a strike would force the unpaid furlough of most of its 90,000 American and American Eagle workers, and cost the company up $50 million a day. It says it has arranged bank loans of up to $2 billion to help it through any strike.</p>
<p>Travel agents leery of a strike have been steering customers away from American, which has said it has arranged for other airlines to honour its tickets.</p>
<p>But the agents said many airlines flying American's routes would be fully booked and unable to carry American passengers.</p>
<p>The hardest hit cities would likely be American's home base of Dallas-Forth Worth and its hubs in Chicago, Miami, New York, Los Angeles and San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Citing some random reports of threats against pilots, an American spokesman said the carrier did not condone such actions and any employee found making threats would be disciplined.</p>
<p>Federal Aviaton Administration spokesman Eliot Brenner said the agency had increased its inspections of American last month when it became clear there was a potential for a labour dispute. He said heightened scrutiny was routine in labour disputes.</p>
<p>Federal mediators stepped into the talks after union members rejected a tentative agreement in January and later negotiations failed to bridge the management-union gap.</p>
<p>American says its pilots are among the highest paid in the industry and that new demands would cripple its ability to compete, threatening its growth and a $6.5 billion order for up to 103 jetliners from Boeing Co..</p>
<p>But union leaders are quick to point to the company's announcement last month that it ran up record profits of $1.02 billion last year.</p>
<p>The Senate aviation subcommitee has urged President Clinton to help mediate the dispute, but the White House said it would not act unless asked by both sides, although it would closely monitor the negotiations.</p>
