<p>Bruce Robinson persuades foreign companies to invest in Northern Ireland on the site of Europe's longest guerrilla war. He says he is winning.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen a significant increase in the level of inward investment,&quot; Robinson, Chief Executive of the Industrial Development Board (IDB) said in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably the best measure is the profile of jobs offered. Up until two years ago that was running at 3,200 a year. Now we are running at 4,200 - we've seen a 50 percent improvement,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;We are doing a lot better than okay.&quot;</p>
<p>Robinson and the IDB shrug off questions about the 28-year political and sectarian conflict which has killed 3,200 and forced the 12,000-strong police force not only to carry arms but to be protected by 18,000 highly-armed British troops.</p>
<p>They say it has not affected the Northern Ireland economy, which has turned the corner from being a backwater into one of the best-performing regions in Britain, including a drop in unemployment from 17.2 percent in 1986 to 8.4 percent in May.</p>
<p>&quot;Any company considering an investment in any part of the world will broadly have the same checklist and the issue of security and stability is on that checklist,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously if there was not the political uncertainty that there is, it would be an easier job to get investment. But I think it's also important to see that we have been attacting investment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Robinson was speaking days after Irish Republican Army guerrillas fighting British rule of Northern Ireland shot dead two policemen in an attack that silenced speculation of a new IRA truce and raised fears of wider sectarian violence.</p>
<p>Next month sees the start of the Protestant Orange Order &quot;marching season&quot; which last year sparked the worst civil violence in years and sent pictures of police being rained upon with petrol bombs and buildings ablaze around the world.</p>
<p>Robinson declined to say what a feared re-run of that violence would do to Northern Ireland's investment image.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very hard to predict what may happen this July both what may happen and then in turn what the impact could be on attracting new investment. I don't think any of us has a crystal ball to see what will occur,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he acknowledged that peace would enhance investment.&quot;I think that that is evident. It would be easier to sell Northern Ireland against that backdrop.&quot;</p>
<p>The IRA called a ceasefire in August 1994 which they broke with two London bombs in February 1996. The guerrillas have been at war ever since but violence has not reached pre-1994 levels, when about 100 people were killed in the province each year.</p>
<p>This year's death toll, against a background of concerted Anglo-Irish attempts to get all sides to peace talks, is 17.</p>
<p>Last year was a record for the IDB, which attracted investment worth 490 million pounds ($801.5 million) in 35 projects featuring high-profile hi-tech foreign firms.</p>
<p>The biggest was an expansion by U.S. disc drive manufacturer Seagate Technology Inc, which joined Korea's Daewoo Elelctronics, Fruit of the Loom Inc of America, Ryobi Ltd of Japan and others who set up operations in the British province.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland offers, among other incentives, zero-rated property tax and no tax on capital grants to lure investors and believes its package is as good if not better than anything offered by another British region.</p>
<p>But its achievements are dwarfed by those in the neighbouring Irish republic, whose IDA investment arm created 13,180 jobs in 1996 and has succeeded in making Ireland the first choice for U.S. greenfield investment.</p>
<p>&quot;You're talking about the market leader,&quot; Robinson said of his next-door rival. &quot;It has a very succesful track record but it is significantly in the U.S. and in othe rparts of the world we have been succeeding.</p>
<p>&quot;We've significantly more Korean investment in Northern Ireland than the Republic and in terms of far Eastern investment generally we have higher level of Japanese investment,&quot; he said.</p>
