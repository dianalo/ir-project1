<headline>Stg calms vs mark in Europe, data impact fleeting.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-09</dateline>

<p>Sterling settled down against the mark during the London morning session, off new 4-1/2-year highs set in early trade while shrugging off the latest UK manufacturing data, traders said.</p>
<p>Analysts said sterling strength is still being heavily driven by deteriorating sentiment toward the mark, although independent support is being derived by expectations of a post-election UK interest rate rise of up to half a percentage point.</p>
<p>News of a slightly lower-than-expected 0.2 percent rise in UK manufacturing output in February did little to alter that expectation and the pound was left relatively unscathed.  </p>
<p>Analysts had expected a 0.3 percent rise in output during the month. The rise in January manufacturing output, however, was revised higher to 0.5 percent and output in the three months to February was up 0.6 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The data was slightly weaker than consensus and the survey evidence does show manufacturers suffering to some degree from a higher pound,&quot; said Brian Martin, chief economist, forex at BZW.</p>
<p>&quot;But still strong growth in private demand is at least partly offsetting this, and together with rising cost pressures we see a rise of up to 50 basis points in UK rates shortly after the election,&quot; said Martin.  </p>
<p>UK bank base lending rates are 6.00 percent at present. The last UK policy-making monetary meeting before the May 1 election is scheduled for Thursday afternoon but no change in interest rates is expected unntil a new government takes power.</p>
<p>At 0951 GMT, the pound was trading at 2.7870/80 marks, up almost a pfennig from 2.7785/95 late Tuesday but off the early peak at 2.7940. Chart analysts said 2.7940 would be sticky for now and 2.8000 acts as psychological resistance.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling's basically been trading sideways this morning but we're still in a weak-mark environment with worries over a political watering of the EMU criteria,&quot; said Martin at BZW.  </p>
<p>The robust dollar/mark in particular is buoying sterling, with a stagnant cable illustrating the market belief that UK and US economic and interest rate cycles are more in synch than the UK and the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>Sterling has firmed independently however during its latest surge and its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies is up more than one percent in the past week, setting a 4-1/2-year high on Monday.</p>
<p>On the domestic front, the latest adjusted opinion poll by ICM for The Guadian newspaper showed the opposition Labour Party's lead over the ruling Conservatives narrowed by two points.  </p>
<p>The ICM poll, which accounts for a perceived unwillingness of voters to declare support for the Conservatives, shows labour with a 12 point lead. This poll has typically shown a much lower Labour lead than the majority of unadjusted polls.</p>
