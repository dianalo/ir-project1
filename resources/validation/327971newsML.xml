<p>--------------------------- Jan 23 -------------------------</p>
<p>*Banks seen holding on to dollars</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Philippine peso was pulled down on Thursday by corporate demand for dollars to close at its day-low of 26.336 against the dollar from 26.325, traders said.</p>
<p>The day's average was at 26.332 from 26.325, with volume down to $135.0 million from $240.1 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was just trading sideways. Corporate reuqirements were just being serviced,&quot; a foreign bank trader said, adding that some $50 million were sold to clients. </p>
<p>Another trader said some $17 million were also sold to oil companies.</p>
<p>The peso traded in a narrow band in thin volume since most banks did not want to let go of their dollars in anticipation of the early full deregulation of the oil industry which has now been scheduled on February 8, traders said.</p>
<p>The deregulation would mean the elimination of the foreign exchange cover given by the government on oil imports.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks are quite defensive on the dollar,&quot; a trader said.</p>
