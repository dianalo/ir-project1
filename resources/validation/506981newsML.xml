<title>USA: Dynamics rejects WHX's increased bid.</title>
<headline>Dynamics rejects WHX's increased bid.</headline>

<p>Dynamics Corp. of America said Monday it has rejected WHX Corp.'s sweetened $45-per share offer for 17 percent of the company's stock, calling the $11 million bid &quot;inadequate.&quot;</p>
<p>Dynamics, which makes electrical appliances and electronic devices, said its board had voted unanimously to reject the offer and recommend that shareholders do the same.</p>
<p>The Dynamics board also voted to &quot;explore alternative transactions to maximize shareholder value,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>WHX increased its bid to $45 a share after Dynamics rejected a $40-a-share offer made on March 31.</p>
<p>WHX officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>Dynamics also said it has postponed its annual meeting to Aug. 1 from May 2, and has added two new board members, expanding the board to nine members.</p>
<p>The two new board members are John Thompson, a principal at the consulting firm IMCOR, and Ronald Steiner, president of International Electronic Research Corp.</p>
<p>WHX last week offered $45 a share for 649,000 Dynamics shares, or 17 percent of the total, and said it would eventually seek to buy all Dynamics shares at $45 each.</p>
<p>WHX said that if it succeeded in buying the additional 17 percent, it would name its own members to Dynamics's board and adopt special by-laws permitting owners of more than a 9.9 percent stake to call special company meetings.</p>
<p>WHX already owns a 2.9 percent stake in Dynamics. Another 17 percent would put its ownership just under Dynamics's anti-takeover provision, or &quot;poison pill,&quot; which kicks in when one party acquires a 20 percent stake.</p>
<p>Dynamics' stock rose $1.25 to $44.75, while WHX was unchanged at $6.50 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.</p>
