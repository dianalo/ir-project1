<headline>Nasdaq ends higher after late-session rally.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>A late rally in several large capitalization technology shares pushed the Nasdaq higher Monday, ending three consecutive days of losses.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index gained 9.52 points or 0.79 percent to close unofficially at 1216.42. The Nasdaq had closed lower in five of the previous nine sessions.</p>
<p>The session was mixed, however, with declining issues beating gaining issues 2343 to 1874 on total volume of 482 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;The day was pretty light, so I'm not sure the gain is a good test of renewed optimism. Solid earnings by Intel and some other heavyweights could be the spark tech shares need for a more sustained rally,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Intel Corp, the most active Nasdaq issue, gained 3-1/4 to 133-3/4 ahead of its first quarter earnings report. After the market closed, Intel said it earned $2.20 a share compared to $1.02 a share last year.</p>
<p>Less fortunate was Novellus Systems Inc, which plunged 22 points to 53 after the company warned it may face potential financial damage from a patent infringement lawsuit.</p>
<p>United Waste Systems Inc fell 4-1/4 to 33-3/8 after it agreed to be bought by USA Waste Services Inc.</p>
