<p>Positive captaincy from Western Province's John Commins was reciprocated by Australia's Mark Taylor as the two teams set up a potentially exciting run chase on the second day of their three-day match at Newlands on Sunday.</p>
<p>Commins, who struck a positive 59 not out, declared his first innings on 261 for five, a deficit of 178, before Taylor, having clearly agreed to set a target on the last day, juggled his batting line-up and encouraged his batsmen to attack. At the close the Australians had reached 78 for four, an overall lead of 256.</p>
<p>Earlier, replying to the tourists' 439 for four declared, W.P. added 78 in 30 overs for the first wicket before South African opener Gary Kirsten smashed a gentle half volley from Jason Gillespie to Steve Waugh in the gully to depart for 37.</p>
<p>Greg Blewett's occasional medium pacers accounted for Kirsten's fellow opener Sven Koenig who also steered a delivery into the gully for a patient three-hour innings of 45.</p>
<p>South Africa's likely test match number three, Jacques Kallis, made 31 before edging a fine Paul Reiffel away swinger into the slips and Herschelle Gibbs, another test player, reached 28 but then gloved an attempted hook off Andy Bichel to Ian Healy behind the stumps. Blewett picked up another victim with an off-cutter that trimmed H.D.Ackerman's off stump but Commins completed a positive half-century with eight fours and one six, off Matthew Elliott's occasional left arm spin, before the declaration.</p>
<p>When Australia batted, another ex-international, left-arm paceman Brett Schultz, forced Justin Langer to glove a hook to the keeper after blasting 21 from 22 balls and then Kallis, a useful outswing bowler, removed Michael Bevan plumb lbw third ball.</p>
<p>Healy and Reiffel were both caught in the gully trying to cut Kallis but Blewett steadied things with an unbeaten 39.</p>
