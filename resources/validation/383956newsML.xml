<headline>SOCCER-WEDNESDAY'S ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE MATCHES.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Matches scheduled for this Wednesday in the English premier league (kick-off times 1945 GMT unless stated, league positions in parentheses):</p>
<p>    Arsenal (3) v Manchester United (1)     (2000 GMT)</p>
<p>Arsenal, linked with Dutch international brothers Frank and Ronald De Boer as they seek to strengthen their title challenge, will be without England goalkeeper David Seaman as they bid to take over at the top. Two points separate the sides and Arsenal, boasting the only unbeaten home record in the division, will need goals from strikers Dutchman Dennis Bergkamp and England's Ian Wright, after three blanks.</p>
<p>Manchester United beat their London title rivals 1-0 earlier in the season, but will be without influential Frenchman Eric Cantona who is starting a two-match ban. Defenders Denis Irwin and Ronny Johnsen return while David May, Nicky Butt and Dutchman Jordi Cruyff are all available.</p>
<p>Aston Villa (7) v Coventry (16)</p>
<p>This local midlands contest sees Villa aiming to rekindle their challenge for a European place while Coventry will be out to consolidate their FA Cup fourth round 2-1 win at Blackburn last Saturday to ease their relegation worries. It is Villa's first game in 17 days. Midfielders Andy Townsend and Mark Draper have recovered from shoulder and hernia problems.</p>
<p>Coventry will be out to avenge a 2-1 defeat by Villa earlier in the season. Defender Gary Breen, recently signed from Birmingham, may return after being cup-tied at the weekend. Dion Dublin will be absent again, for the final time in a seven-game suspension.</p>
<p>Derby County (13) v Sheffield Wednesday (8)</p>
<p>These two teams won last Saturday against West Ham, 1-0 in the league, and Bradford, 1-0 in the FA Cup fifth-round, respectively.</p>
<p>Derby manager Jim Smith will be without Ron Willems (hamstring), Jacob Laursen (calf), Dean Yates (knee ligament) and Matt Carbon (groin). Daryl Powell will be suspended, but striker Ashley Ward is available for selection.</p>
<p>The visitors have drafted in ONeill Donaldson from a reserve game fixture as a possible replacement for the doubtful midfielder Graham Hyde.</p>
<p>Liverpool (2) v Leeds (11)  </p>
<p>Liverpool have had more than two weeks to recover from their 4-2 defeat by Chelsea in the FA Cup and will be aiming to reassert their title bid.</p>
<p>Manager Roy Evans will be without Irish defender Phil Babb for a minimum of three weeks. Babb underwent a cartilage operation after injuring himself in training on international duty.</p>
<p>Leeds, stinging from a 3-2 home defeat by first division Portsmouth in the FA Cup last Saturday, need to bounce back to form. Coach George Graham has a fully-fit squad apart from long- term injuries Richard Jobson and John Pemberton, but faces a dilemma over the selection of former Wales and Liverpool striker Ian Rush because of his indifferent form.</p>
<p>West Ham United (18) v Newcastle (4)</p>
<p>Struggling West Ham will be without Danish defender Marc Rieper, who injured his left ankle in last Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Derby. He joins long-term injured Australian midfielder Stan Lazaridis (groin) and John Moncur (knee ligament) out of action. But coach Harry Redknapp will expect his new 7.3 million pounds ($11.7 million) strike-force of Welsh international John Hartson and Paul Kitson to make up for a dismal joint debut last weekend.</p>
<p>Newcastle need a win to stay in touch with the title race. They drew 1-1 against West Ham last November, but will expect to improve on that result as manager Kenny Dalglish remoulds the side for the championship run-in. He is not expected to select French winger David Ginola who has been linked with Italian club Internazionale.</p>
