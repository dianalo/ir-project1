<p>The mandate for an expected 1.0 billion mark 10-year fixed-rate Eurobond for Greece is soon to be announced, new issues traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>The bidding process is underway and the announcement is due early next week, they said.</p>
<p>But some syndicate officials in Frankfurt said a 10-year maturity would not be easy to achieve.</p>
<p>Some said a launch spread of around 100 basis points over Bunds could be seen, others said 90 b.p. over the April 2006 Bund was also probable.  </p>
<p>&quot;The long-term (mark) sector is extremely difficult to achieve. Institutional investors are not buying long-dated paper and I don't think the yield pick-up will be enough to attract them,&quot; a syndicate official said.</p>
<p>&quot;A shorter maturity would be more advisable, but I think Greece has already set their mind on a 10-year transaction,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But another syndicate official in Frankfurt said the five-year mark sector was crowded and they would do better to tap the seven or 10-year sectors.</p>
<p>Greece is rated Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB- by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>In mid-August, the country privately placed a 120 million mark FRN to yield 55 b.p. over six-month LIBOR.</p>
<p>It launched a 1.0 billion mark seven-year Eurobond off its EMTN Programme in mid-January via joint lead managers WestLB and Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>The bond yielded 100 b.p. over the 7.125 percent Treuhand due January 2003.</p>
