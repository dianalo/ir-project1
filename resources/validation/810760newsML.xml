<p>After two and a half days, prayers for a miracle were finally answered here early on Saturday when a muffled voice called from the depths of the rubble of a landslide.</p>
<p>Buried beneath big slabs of concrete, trapped in a black pocket of space almost 10 metres into the rubble, despondent rescuers found what even they had begun to feel was beyond their reach -- signs of life.</p>
<p>After three nights of freezing temperatures, when the mercury dived as low as minus-12 degrees Celsius (about 10 degrees Fahrenheit), a man's voice called to rescuers, sending a shudder of excitement and disbelief through the exhausted rescue party.</p>
<p>&quot;A miracle has occurred,&quot; a triumpant police Chief Superintendent Charlie Sanderson told reporters.</p>
<p>A thumb raised in triumph was the only sign to onlookers, crowded on a hillside facing the landslide, that the mood of depair gripping Australia's main winter playground had broken.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the half-light of dawn in hand-numbing cold, about 100 rescuers sprang into action, feverishly trying to tunnel toward the man, working up to their neck in rubble so unstable that police held serious fears of another landslide.</p>
<p>Human chains formed to ferry buckets of dirt away from the tunnel, as rescuers inched their way toward the man, said by local media and people on the site to be local ski instructor Stuart Diver, who told them he felt numb. Police have declined to identify the man.</p>
<p>A team of specialist ambulance officers stood by with a thermal blanket and appeared to be setting up an intravenous drip.</p>
<p>Among the debris that came to the surface were ironing boards, sheets, a pair of jeans and a microwave oven. Sensors were fed into the rubble and detected muscle movement.</p>
<p>The excitement was palpable.</p>
<p>Crowds of onlookers gathered, a look of anxiety replacing the stony expressions of the past days, since a landslide engulfed two ski lodges late on Wednesday night, entombing the 20 people believed to have been inside.</p>
<p>&quot;It's fantastic,&quot; said Rebecca Thompson, a tourist from the west Australian city of Perth.</p>
<p>She has been in Thredbo village, nestled in a valley of the Snowy Mountains southwest of Sydney, for the past week and has seen the picturesque village become a ghost town.</p>
<p>&quot;It's awful that we have lost lives, but they have got some fantastic workers out there. They never give up hope.</p>
<p>&quot;It's pretty surreal. It's hard to believe you are watching it (the rescue effort) on the news and then seeing it out your kitchen window,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>For the victims' family and friends, who prayed for survivors inside Thredbo's small sunlit church on Friday just as police told them to expect the worst, it is still a nightmare.</p>
<p>Three bodies have been found and another 16 are missing.</p>
