<headline>Toyota sees 10,000 Cavaliers sold in 1998.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-08-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Toyota Motor Corp expects to sell about 10,000 Toyota Cavaliers in Japan next year, and has not given up on the car despite poor demand in the past, executive vice president Iwao Okijima told reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>Okijima, speaking at a dinner conference in New York, said Toyota is trying various different marketing approaches for Cavalier, a model based on General Motors Corp's Chevrolet Cavalier.</p>
<p>He said Toyota had originally hoped to sell 20,000 units a year, but &quot;sales have been disappointing.  However I do think people are starting to recognize (Cavalier).&quot;  </p>
<p>Sales in Japan of the GM-made Toyota Cavalier totalled about 11,400 units in calendar 1996. Toyota started selling the model in Japan in January 1996 after reaching agreement that Toyota would market GM cars under the Toyota brand name.</p>
<p>Okijima, in New York to discuss Toyota's recent business performance with the financial community, also stated that Toyota has benefitted from the weakening of the Japanese yen, which helped boost Toyota's net income by more than 50 percent for the fiscal year ended March 31.  </p>
<p>He added that while the company has experienced an increase in manufacturing costs due to the weaker yen, improved efficiencies have minimized the impact and enabled Toyota to absorb the higher costs.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as the yen floats between 110 and 120 (yen to the dollar), we should be able to absorb the higher manufacturing costs,&quot; Okijima said.  &quot;Quick moves in either direction can make it difficult for us however.&quot;</p>
<p>Toyota believes a yen to dollar rate of 110-120 is an appropriate rate for the Japanese car industry, Okijima said.  </p>
<p>Okijima said Toyota is focused on finding ways to continually enhance shareholder value. Among the company's plans is to buy back up to 100 billion yen of its own shares this fiscal year. &quot;We did 100 billion yen last year and we plan to do 100 billion yen again this year also,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Okijima said that 1996 was the first year that such repurchase programs were permitted in Japan, following the deregulation of Japan's commercial code. Toyota has also implemented a stock option program for directors this year &quot;to encourage a shareholder-oriented perspective in management.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Toyota will continue to focus on five main themes: (1) strengthening its product line, particulary in North America, (2) asserting its competitive edge in technology, (3) reasserting leadership in the Japanese market, (4) globalizing operations further, (5) developing business in nonautomotive sectors.</p>
<p>Okijima said the company plans to sell six million vehicles a year by the early 21st century, while maintaining an operating profit margin of about nine percent. Last year, Toyota produced about 3.5 million vehicles in Japan and about 1.4 million in other nations.</p>
<p>Okijima said nearly all of the one million vehicle per year increase will take place outside of Japan.</p>
