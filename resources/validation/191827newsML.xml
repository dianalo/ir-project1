<p>Copper prices climbed to their highest levels for 2-1/2 months on the London Metal Exchange (LME) on Friday, on heavy speculative buying by traders nervous about low world stocks.</p>
<p>The LME reported that stocks of copper in its recognised global worldwide warehouses had fallen 8,000 tonnes to a 6-1/4 year low of just 101,175 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;The market reacted to that (in moving higher), because it had been pushed lower on some talk of a stock increase. That has forced the shorts to cover,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Market movements were extreme, with the benchmark three months price moving from an early low of $2,010 a tonne up to just under $2,130. On Thursday, the market had ended at $2,032.</p>
<p>Analysts said wide price moves were typical of a market gripped by uncertainty over the nature of total copper stocks.</p>
<p>Although the LME, the world's biggest non-ferrous metals market and COMEX, the New York copper futures market publicly declare their stock levels, inventory is also stored in other warehouses that is not reported.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue has been clouded by the reports of statistical errors in counting the level of stock movement in and out of Rotterdam over the past few years,&quot; analyst Martin Squires of LME trader Rudolf Wolff and Co said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week the UK-based statistical body World Bureau of Metal Statistics (WBMS) stunned the market saying nearly 600,000 tonnes of copper not previously reported may have built up in Netherlands bonded warehouses between 1991 and 1995.</p>
<p>Traders are sceptical that so much copper could be hidden, and after some price weakness, the market appears to have put this aside and responded to the visible metal shortage.</p>
<p>Analysts at LME trader Brandeis (Brokers) Ltd said that to store this tonnage would require a warehouse of a substantial size, since copper stored outside patinates (turns green).</p>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile, the costs of financing a stock build of 500,000 tonnes would be over $1 billion at current prices - not an insignificant amount,&quot; Brandeis said in a daily report.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever the situation is, the focus should be on what level of stocks are readily available,&quot; Squires said, noting that total reported commercial stocks stand at under four weeks consumption - a critical level.</p>
<p>In the short-term, the copper market is likely to go higher still, as LME cash premiums increase (backwardation) and big short positions mature, traders said.</p>
<p>But prices will eventually weaken as oversupply accelerates - the result of the Sumitomo Corp affair when prices were maintained at artificially high levels for years. In June, Sumitomo fired its former head trader Yasuo Hamanaka after it alleged that he admitted running up losses now put at $2.6 billion in 10 years of unauthorised trading. Hamanaka has since been arrested and charged with fraud.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that the legacy of the supported copper price during the early 1990s has led to a devastating tidal wave of new low cost supply which encroaches by the day,&quot; analyst Nick Moore of the Flemings Global Mining Group said.</p>
<p>The market is already moving away from supply/demand balance, despite robust consumption, and surpluses lie ahead. There is likely to be an accumulated surplus in excess of one million tonnes by the dawn of the next millenium, Moore said.</p>
