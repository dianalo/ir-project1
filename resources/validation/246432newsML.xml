<p>President Bill Clinton criticised Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday for having cancelled local elections, saying that &quot;the voice of the people should be heard.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked at a White House event if he had anything to say to Milosovic, Clinton replied: &quot;That elections should be respected and that the voice of the people should be heard and that the human, political and civil rights of the people should be respected.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Neither we nor anyone else would seek to interfere in the internal events of Serbia,&quot; Clinton said after naming Evelyn Lieberman, his deputy chief of staff, to head the Voice of America government-run radio broadcaster.</p>
<p>&quot;But our sympathies are always with free people who are struggling to express their freedom and want to have the integrity of their elections respected,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Street protests began in Belgrade three weeks ago when Milosevic's socialist government annulled local election victories, including in Belgrade, by the opposition.</p>
<p>On Monday, Washington increased pressure on Milosevic by cancelling a senior-level meeting with him, and one U.S. official said, &quot;We are cutting him off little by little.&quot;</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Secretary of State John Kornblum, the special envoy on Bosnia, had been scheduled to meet Milosevic in Belgrade this week after a NATO meeting but had decided to call off the visit, a senior U.S. official said.</p>
<p>Kornblum acted after Serbia's top court awarded control of the Belgrade city council to the ruling Socialists after an election that the opposition was widely viewed as having won.</p>
