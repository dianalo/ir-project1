<headline>Malaysia says surprised by Singapore paper claims.</headline>

<p>Malaysia's foreign minister voiced surprise on Tuesday at a Singapore newspaper report that former Singapore prime minister Lee Kuan Yew was probably justified in making remarks about a Malaysian state which created a fierce row between the two neighbours.</p>
<p>&quot;I certainly am surprised and certainly don't understand the motive of The Straits Times...to want to continue this debate,&quot; Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said in a late-evening news programme over private television channel, TV3.</p>
<p>He said the row between the two nations should have ended with a Singapore High Court order on Monday to expunge Lee's remarks about alleged crime levels in Malaysia's southern Johor state from his affidavit.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Abdullah had said he welcomed the Singapore court's decision to delete the remarks.</p>
<p>&quot;If that is the case, then I think it is a good development,&quot; Badawi told reporters, adding he had not yet read the report. &quot;Hopefully, this will lead to better ties between the two countries.&quot;</p>
<p>In a report on Tuesday, the pro-government Straits Times said it had analysed press reports of crime in the Malaysian city of Johor, to which Singapore opposition politician Tang Liang Hong fled after January general elections saying he had received death threats at home.</p>
<p>Lee, one of a dozen members of the ruling People's Action Party suing Tang for libel, said in an affidavit it was irrational to flee to Johor, a city &quot;notorious for shootings, muggings and car-jackings&quot;.</p>
<p>Malaysia reacted to what it perceived as a major insult with fury. Lee, in a rare move, offered an unreserved apology. Kuala Lumpur still seethed and Lee promised to have the remarks stricken from the record.</p>
<p>Kuala Lumpur accepted the promise, but stressed that it would take time for the wound to heal.</p>
<p>The Singapore High Court agreed on Monday to let Lee delete the remarks.</p>
<p>In his public statements, Lee never said he was wrong. In evidence to the court on Monday, Lee said he had based his remarks on newspaper reports that gave him the impression Johor was a dangerous place.</p>
<p>The Straits Times said it has examined those reports and had concluded Lee was justified in his perception.</p>
<p>&quot;An analysis of these reports shows that anyone reading them might well form a picture of Johor as being an unsafe place,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It said that in 1995 there were 46 muggings, shootings and car-jackings. In 1996 there were 39 and there had been 12 so far this year, the newspaper said in a full-page report.</p>
<p>The newspaper said several victims of such serious crimes were among the tens of thousands of Singaporeans who regularly cross the causeway linking Singapore to the Malaysian peninsula to visit Johor.</p>
<p>It also noted that two policemen were shot and wounded on March 12, the day news broke of Lee's comments in what he had understood to be an affidavit not meant for public consumption.</p>
<p>The comments, released by Tang and Malaysian lawyer Abdul Razak Ahmad in Johor, enraged Malaysians. Many took to the streets to demonstrate their anger, some carrying banners bearing unprecedented insults directed at Lee.</p>
