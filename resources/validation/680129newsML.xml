<p>Integrated access equipment company Poh Lian Holdings Ltd said on Monday it had won a Singapore $97 million building works contract for a Singapore housing development project.  </p>
<p>Poh Lian said in a statement the Regentville project would be its biggest construction contract to date and marked its continued diversification into private sector building works.</p>
<p>&quot;The Regentville project is in line with our strategy of diversification into the construction of private property projects which are targeted to meet the requirements of our customers,&quot; said Poh Lian chief executive Tan Eng Khiam.</p>
<p>Tan said the firm would continue to tender for new building projects and was currently negotiating four other private sector contracts.  </p>
<p>Regentville is a 15-storey, five-block apartment development, due to be completed in 25 months, and takes to S$213 million the value of construction projects on Poh Lian's books which it expects to complete within the next two to three years.</p>
<p>The statement also said Poh Lian's CME Industries Pte Ltd unit had secured advance orders of about S$1 million for a range of hoists made by Dutch firm HEK Manufacturing BV.</p>
<p>CME was named on Monday as exclusive dealer for the range, the statement said.</p>
