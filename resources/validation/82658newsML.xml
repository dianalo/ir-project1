<p>A court in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City has rejected an appeal against the death sentence by a man extradited from Cambodia on embezzlement charges, a state newspaper said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Tuoi Tre newspaper said the southern city's appeals court had decided to uphold the highest penalty against Nguyen Than Tai who was sentenced to death in June.</p>
<p>The report gave no date for an execution.</p>
<p>Vietnam's official media reported in July that Tai, a cashier at an agricultural firm, had been found guilty of embezzling some $138,000 in trade bills and cash and fleeing to Cambodia. He was later extradited.</p>
<p>His parents and another woman were sentenced to jail terms of between three and 10 years for living off the proceeds.</p>
<p>The human rights group Amnesty International said earlier this year it was concerned about the growing use of the death penalty in Vietnam with its use in cases involving economic crime.</p>
