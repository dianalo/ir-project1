<text>
<p>Following are some of the main factors likely to affect Indonesian stocks on Wednesday:</p>
<p>* U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, as falling bond interest rates lifted blue-chip shares, but a series of profit warnings sparked a sell-off in technology shares. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.75 points to 7,312.15.</p>
<p>* The government will announce the consumer price index for May and trade figures after its monthly cabinet meeting. Reuters reported on Monday that the May consumer price index was seen rising 0.18-0.20 percent month/month vs 0.56 percent in April.</p>
<p>* Indonesia will run an unprecedented revote on the East Java island of Madura on Wednesday. Electoral officers said there would be a revote at 86 polling stations in Sampang town after an angry crowd alleging election rigging burned ballot boxes after last Thursday's polls.</p>
<p>MARKET</p>
<p>* On Tuesday, Jakarta stocks ended down due to profit taking after recent sharp gains, brokers said. The Jakarta index fell 1.33 points, or 0.19 percent, to close at 698.40 points.</p>
<p>* On Wednesday, the rupiah was quoted at 2,426.00/60.50 at 0140 GMT, compared with an opening of 2,427.00/28.00.</p>
