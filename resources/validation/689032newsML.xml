<p>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Friday forecast annual underlying inflation declining to around 1.0 percent by the end of 1997 and stabilising there through 1998 and 1999.</p>
<p>It is then projected to rise gradually to slightly above the middle of the bank's government mandated 0-3 percent target, the bank said in its six monthly Monetary Policy Statement (MPS).</p>
<p>&quot;The Reserve Bank is increasingly confident that inflation pressures are dropping away, and for the second time in six months we are able to ease monetary policy,&quot; RBNZ Governor Don Brash told journalists.</p>
<p>In his MPS Brash sanctioned a 100 basis point easing compared to the central bank's previous projection in March.</p>
<p>Although the RBNZ expresses its opinion on monetary conditions, including the level of short market rates and the currency, it does not have a single steering rate which it sets.</p>
<p>Brash said inflationary pressures had been easing as the economy had weakened in recent months.</p>
<p>&quot;As well, previous rises in the exchange rate are now more clearly reducing prices.&quot;</p>
<p>However, Brash said that the effect of increased government spending over the next 12-18 months and planned tax cuts in 1998 would halt the decline in inflation pressures.</p>
<p>The bank forecast underlying inflation in the June 1997 quarter would be 0.3 percent, the same as for the next two quarters in 1997. Core inflation is seen falling to 0.1 percent in the March 1998 quarter.</p>
<p>In the March 1998 year it is seen at 1.0 percent, rising to 1.1 percent in 1999 and 1.7 percent in the March 2000 year.</p>
<p>In its March Economic Projections, the bank saw underlying annual inflation falling from 2.2 percent in March 1997 to 0.8 percent in June 1998, staying there for three quarters and then rising again to 2.0 percent by March 2000.</p>
<p>However, March 1997 quarter inflation actually came out at 1.97 percent and since the March statement the economy has shown itself to be weaker, with less inflation pressure than economists had predicted.</p>
<p>The bank has altered the method of how it projects inflation. Previously, it projected inflation on straight line assumptions about how monetary conditions would behave, whereas now the bank is projecting how it believes conditions would need to behave to deliver inflation into the middle of its target.</p>
<p>Brash's easing move was a response to the lower inflation track, though he noted that since March markets had already eased conditions so the bank was not seeking a further easing at the present time.</p>
<p>The bank estimated underlying inflation to be 1.5 percent in the years to June 1997 and September 1997.</p>
<p>The projected inflation rate would be affected by uncertainties surrounding the fiscal policy outlook, particularly relating to a referendum in September on compulsory pensions.</p>
<p>There would also continue to be uncertainty on the effects of the passthrough of exchange rates into the inflation rate.</p>
<p>Brash said that as the low inflation regime was bedding in for longer, the bank expected to see rates of credit growth and real interest rates move closer to those found in other low inflation countries.</p>
