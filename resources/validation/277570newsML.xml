<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-12-27</dateline>

<p>IMM currency futures finished mixed, with March yen and Swiss franc each setting new contract lows while sterling surged to sharp gains and a new contract high.</p>
<p>Traders attributed the divergence between yen and sterling partly to cross activity on interest rate differentials.</p>
<p>They cited perceptions that Japan's sputtering economy could not withstand a rate hike, even though that might help keep investors attracted to yen-denominated assets.</p>
<p>Conversely, they viewed Britain's economy as robust enough to warrant another inflation-fighting rate rise soon.  </p>
<p>March yen continued its overnight erosion and near the close of European trading slumped to its contract low price of $0.008690.</p>
<p>The dollar hurdled 116.00 yen and hit a ceiling at 116.20 during North American hours as March yen futures slightly overshot $0.008695, which roughly corresponds to 116.20.</p>
<p>Some brokers noted signs the some players who were short dollars from 113.00 were finally squaring up before year-end.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody's who was short dollars at 113.00 is getting out,&quot; one floor broker of the yen's slide. &quot;It's really just some people getting stuck.&quot;  </p>
<p>Brokers said one firm was seen selling a couple of hundred March Swiss francs as that unit sagged to another new contract low, this one at $0.7452, at midday on sales against higher-yielding units such as marks and sterling.</p>
<p>March sterling popped up to a new contract high, at 1.6926, with some saying buying traced partly to small fund purchases. One arm of a French-owned bank bought some 2,200 March sterling on the day as that unit jumped, brokers said.</p>
<p>But brokers looked for sterling buyers to turn leery as that contract nears 1.70, with some selling pressure expected to emerge between the 1.70 and 2.00 levels.  </p>
<p>Additional weight on currencies stemmed from a rise in U.S. Treasury bond futures coupled with early firming in U.S. stocks, which later erased the bulk of gains.</p>
<p>Futures edged up slightly after much weaker than expected November U.S. durable goods orders, which fell 1.6 percent versus forecasts for a 0.1 percent rise. Ex-defense, orders fell 3.4 percent, well below forecasts for a 0.5 percent fall.</p>
<p>March yen fell $0.000053 to $0.008750, marks eased $0.0001 to $0.6464, Swiss fr lost $0.0028 to $0.7465, sterling rallied $0.0218 to $1.6918, Can dollar lost $0.0026 to $0.7350, Aus dollar up $0.0009 to $0.7949, Mex peso off $0.000050 at $0.121675.
