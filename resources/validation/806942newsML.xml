<p>Egon Krenz, East Germany's last hardline communist leader, told a Berlin court on Monday he bore no responsibility for the killings of people trying to escape to the West during the Cold War.</p>
<p>But Krenz, 60, who is accused on four counts of manslaughter, told the court, due to give its verdict next Monday, that he would be ashamed to be acquitted at the end of what he called a political trial.</p>
<p>&quot;I would feel shame at an acquittal as long as the unjust verdicts handed to border soldiers and to my friends under arrest are not quashed,&quot; he said, referring to previous convictions on charges related to border killings.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have demanded an 11-year jail sentence for Krenz, saying he bore direct responsibility for the killings as a member of East Germany's ruling Politburo.</p>
<p>In his hour-long closing speech, Krenz repeated his defence that East German border policy was dictated by the former Soviet Union and he said border guards had never been issued with an &quot;order to shoot&quot;.</p>
<p>More than 900 people were killed between 1949 and 1989 trying to flee the communist country.</p>
<p>Krenz, who succeeded Erich Honecker as leader of the East German state as it began to crumble in 1989, said he felt some blame for the collapse of what he called the &quot;better Germany&quot;.</p>
<p>Also on trial on three counts of manslaughter are the former East Berlin communist party chief, Guenter Schabowski, and East German economic policy supremo Guenther Kleiber, who could face nine and seven and a half years' jail respectively if convicted.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers have asked for acquittals in all three cases, arguing that no individual blame can be attached to the border killings.</p>
