<p>James Fox, former head of the FBI's New York office who ran the World Trade Centre investigation and helped put reputed mobster John Gotti behind bars, died Friday at age 59.</p>
<p>Fox, who retired from the FBI in 1994, died of bacterial peritonitis, an infection of the abdominal lining, said his assistant, Maria Aleman.</p>
<p>He had been hospitalized since last week, she said.</p>
<p>Fox led investigations into some of the most high-profile criminal cases in New York, including the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre.</p>
<p>He also headed the investigation that ended with the 1992 conviction of Gotti, the reputed head of the Gambino crime family. Gotti was convicted of murder and racketeering and is serving life without parole in federal prison.</p>
<p>Fox left the FBI after a 31-year career. The month before his planned retirement, he was suspended for commenting on the World Trade Centre case in a television interview while the trial was going on.</p>
<p>He became executive vice president of Mutual of America insurance company.</p>
<p>Fox died at New York City's Mount Sinai Medical Centre, where he had been since Monday. He originally checked into New York Hospital last Friday, his assistant said.</p>
<p>Fox lived in Manhattan. He leaves his wife Elaine and two daughters.</p>
