<p>The Swedish crown is being weighed down by uncertainty about financial policies and Europe's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and is fundamentally undervalued, economists said on Friday.</p>
<p>The uncertainty is leading to increased volatility in the currency, which has weakened significantly in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters on average forecast the crown will trade in a range of 4.35-4.50 to the mark over the next six months. Late Friday the crown was trading at 4.4440 to the mark.</p>
<p>The Trade Currency Weighted (TCW) index, which indicates the strength of the crown against a weighted basket of currencies, has climbed to over 120 points.</p>
<p>It has remained at that level over the past two days despite the central bank intervening to buy the crown against the mark.</p>
<p>The index has not been as high since February last year when the index hit 122.57 but economists saw the weakness as temporary.</p>
<p>&quot;The weakening is temporary and the crown will probably stabilise when Sweden has taken a position to ERM and EMU,&quot; said Agnete Fich of Den Danske Bank. Sweden has yet to say if it will join monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we will see a lot of volatility in the crown until the (ruling) Social Democrats make a decision on EMU,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The fundamentals of the Swedish economy were seen as strong and against that background economists said the crown was undervalued.</p>
<p>But the political risk was weighing the unit down and causing uncertainty among overseas players who are concerned that the government is loosening its grip on financial policies and about its unwillingness to take a stand on EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;We have difficulties seeing how the concerns about the crown will be dispersed in the next six months,&quot; one Stockholm analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;The volatility is expected to increase as a result of the good economic fundamentals standing against the political risk.&quot;</p>
<p>The crown has weakened sharply. On April 24 1995 the crown was trading at 7.4741 crowns to the dollar and traded on Friday at 7.4161. Against the mark the crown has shown similar weakness.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to analyse. The crown could possibly weaken against the TCW-index because of continuing dollar strength,&quot; one economist said. &quot;Against the mark the crown has been volatile but it is now relatively stable.&quot;</p>
<p>Another analyst expected a fall in the TCW index which is viewed increasingly by economists as a key indicator of monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the TCW-index will come down to 117 again. Last time the Riksbank lowered its reverse repurchase rate (on December 17 to 4.10 percent) it came down to 116.95 at the end of the day,&quot; he said.</p>
