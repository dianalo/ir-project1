<p>The key September 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) futures contract closed at a four-month high on Tuesday, retaining firmness from the morning.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was looking for somebody who would give it a push from behind, but there was no such person in the afternoon,&quot; said a dealer at a &quot;Big Four&quot; brokerage house.</p>
<p>JGBs were boosted by panic buying towards midday partly due to comments by Economic Planning Agency Minister Taro Aso, who said a report from the United States earlier this month that had him saying it was possible Japan's official discount rate would be raised by the year-end was not entirely correct.  </p>
<p>Aso told a news conference the interviewer did not refer to a time frame in his question and he only said it was possible the Bank of Japan (BOJ) would raise rates.</p>
<p>The September closed at 127.12, the highest close since April 10. Monday's finish was 126.95.</p>
<p>Turnover was 33,679 contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;Aso's denial fit the view, now becoming dominant in the market, that there will be no rate rise by the year-end,&quot; said a dealer at an agricultural financial institution. The remarks triggered buying at the long end of the JGB yield curve, sending the key 182nd 10-year JGB yield to a new low.  </p>
<p>&quot;But compared with today's rally in JGB futures, the gains in the cash benchmark were limited. That suggested operators are still very cautious about buying at the current high levels,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The yield of key 182nd issue stood at 2.065 percent at 0649 GMT after falling to an all-time low for any benchmark JGB of 2.060 percent in early afternoon.</p>
<p>The yield closed at 2.085 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>There was also some talk in the morning that the BOJ's next &quot;tankan&quot; quarterly survey of business sentiment would be poor and that its release might be delayed as a result.  </p>
<p>But traders said many considered the talk confusing because the September tankan has been scheduled for release in early October since January of this year.</p>
<p>Asked about the talk, a BOJ spokesman told Reuters that he had no comment to make on the market rumours.</p>
<p>The market has been waiting for institutional investors to return to the market after summer holidays, as their moves are seen as essential to help bonds find direction.</p>
<p>But traders said no significant investor activity was detected, except for option-related JGB trading and buying of the 197th 10-year issue, probably by public funds.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere, bank debentures firmed as they caught up with the recent rally in JGBs, traders said.</p>
<p>Few traders felt a try for the all-time high for any key JGB futures contract of 127.34 was likely this week amid a continuing shortage of fresh factors and ahead of a 10-year JGB auction expected early next week.</p>
<p>&quot;If the September rises to 127.40-127.50, the Finance Ministry would set a new coupon rate at 2.2 percent, much lower than the record low of 2.4 percent. I don't think that is likely to happen,&quot; said the first dealer. -- Risa MAEDA Tokyo Treasury Desk (813) 3432-8570 email: tokyo.newsroom@reuters.com</p>
