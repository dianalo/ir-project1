<p>European efforts to bring together Palestinians and Israelis floundered on Tuesday despite intensive negotiations, Palestinian officials said.</p>
<p>The European Union had hoped to bring Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy together to discuss the Middle East peace crisis on a fringes of a European-Mediterranean conference in Malta.</p>
<p>&quot;The chances of a meeting between Mr Levy and the president almost do not exist. The president is not going to meet with Mr Levy because of certain issues that need to be discussed,&quot; Arafat spokesman Marwan Kanafani told Reuters.</p>
<p>Kanafani said even a meeting between Levy and a Palestinian minister now looked unlikely.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a quasi-agreement that Levy would meet a Palestinian minister. The president authorised a meeting. Now there has been a retraction on this position,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said he would meet Levy.</p>
<p>In his speech to the Malta conference, Levy urged the Palestinians to resume negotiations without conditions. Diplomats say the Palestinians are pressing for an Israeli gesture, especially on Israel's construction of a settlement in East Jerusalem which has plunged the peace process into crisis.</p>
<p>After a plenary conference session, 15 European ministers met separately with Arafat and then with Levy to try to bridge differences.</p>
<p>None of the ministers, nor the Palestinian president, made any statements on leaving the talks.</p>
<p>Earlier, Arafat and Levy briefly shook hands during a reception hosted by Maltese Prime Minister Alfred Sant. It was the highest level contact since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave the go-ahead for the settlement.</p>
<p>But the rancour returned as Arafat and Levy addressed the conference.</p>
<p>&quot;With the current Israeli government we have faced many obstacles and impediments,&quot; Arafat said. &quot;Instead of continuing to build and reinforce fruitful cooperation and mutual respect ... the Israeli government continues its settlement policy.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been running around in closed circles without reaching any kind of positive agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>In response, Levy appealed for &quot;the Palestinian Authority to broadcast, to publicise an unequivocably clear message against terrorism, refuting terrorism, returning to the dialogue, making the peace objective a common goal&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the efforts of the European Commission to promote the Malta conference as a showcase for EU-Mediterranean cooperation, the Middle East crisis dominated.</p>
<p>In recognition of the gravity of the crisis, Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo -- the conference chairman -- agreed to give double speaking time to Levy, Arafat and Algeria, coordinator of the Arab group.</p>
<p>With other ministers overstepping their alloted time, the meeting adjourned at 1615 GMT with nine delegations still to be heard. It will resume on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>EU efforts to bring about a breakthrough in the Middle East are being matched by U.S. efforts to end the impase.</p>
<p>On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeliene Albright despatched envoy Dennis Ross back to the region for talks with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Senior Arab officials met earlier on Tuesday and Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf said they wanted a reference to the Middle East stalemate in the final statement, but EU officials said they would try avoid this.</p>
<p>&quot;We want the final declaration to make a reference to this situation and express a position regarding the stalemate the peace process is facing.&quot; Attaf said.</p>
<p>Other controversies, bracketed in a recent draft of the final statement, are over human rights, recognition of NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and the rights of emigrants -- mainly a reference to foreigners working in Europe.</p>
