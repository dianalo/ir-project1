<p>New Clicks Holdings Ltd has bought Compact Disc Wherehouse for an undiscolsed sum as part of a drive to expand and diversify its music business.</p>
<p>&quot;Although this is a small deal in relative terms, it has huge potential for us as we intend to double our exposure to the music and related entertainment market within the next three years,&quot; New Clicks chief executive Trevor Honneysett said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In terms of the deal, which goes into effect on September 1, New Clicks will take over the stock, fixtures and Compact Disc Wherehouse trademark, under which it will open between seven and 10 new stores over the next three years.</p>
<p>The existing store will remain in Johannesburg's Rosebank suburb.</p>
<p>The new music warehouses will be run as a completely separate division from the group's present Clicks, Diskom and Musica divisions.</p>
<p>A family-owned business, the specialist Compact Disc Wherehouse was started in 1988 by music experts Lennie and Dina Berolsky, who will remain involved in order to ensure continuity.</p>
<p>Honeysett said the acquisition would have a positive but minimal impact on group earnings in the short term but would enhance returns in the long term.</p>
<p>It was expected that the new stores would average an annual turnover of 20 million rand each with the return on sales expected to be more than 10 percent, which compared favourably with the retail music industry average of between four and six percent.</p>
<p>The second Compact Disc Wherehouse would be opened within six months at a location still to be determined, Honeysett said.</p>
