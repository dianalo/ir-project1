<p>Uzbek President Islam Karimov and Pakistani President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari on Saturday urged an immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan, peace talks between all factions and the imposition of an arms embargo.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the Afghan problem can only be decided with peace negotiations between all political forces in Afghanistan,&quot; Karimov told a news conference after talks with the Pakistani leader at a government residence on the outskirts of the Uzbek capital Tashkent.</p>
<p>For his part, Leghari said: &quot;We are in full agreement with Uzbekistan that there must be a total arms embargo in Afghanistan.&quot;</p>
<p>There was no official comment on reports in the Pakistani press that Uzbek chieftain General Abdul Rashid Dostum was meeting at the same time with his supposed foe, the leader of the radical Islamic Taleban militia, Mullah Mohammad Omar.</p>
<p>The warm words between Karimov and Leghari and the signing of two agreements to combat terrorism and drug trafficking contrasted with their widely-assumed positions as backers of the two factions.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Uzbek leader, at a Commonwealth of Independent States summit, called for support for General Dostum, saying he was all that stood between the Taleban and the former Soviet republics of Central Asia.</p>
<p>On Saturday, however, he appeared to change his tune, saying: &quot;This government wants to emphasise that without the participation of all ethnic, religious and regional groups of Afghanistan, there will be no durable and substantive peace there.&quot;</p>
<p>Karimov said peace talks should take place under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. Diplomats have said Uzbekistan has provided low-key support for Dostum's faction while Pakistan is widely believed to have provided substantial backing for the Taleban.</p>
<p>The governments of Central Asia fear the turmoil in neighbouring Afghanistan could spill over into their territories, bringing with it radical Islam and potentially explosive ethnic unrest.</p>
<p>Afghanistan borders three of Central Asia's five states: Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Economics appears to have outweighed Uzbekistan's and Pakistan's support for the main opposing factions.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan is desperate for a land route south to ports on the Arabian Sea instead of the traditonal route north through Russia while Pakistan is anxious to break into Central Asia's emerging markets. Afghanistan stands in the way.</p>
<p>Leghari told reporters on Saturday: &quot;The development of overland routes, whether through railway or roads or even the laying of pipelines for gas and oil (through Afghanistan), is the major infrastructure that would transform this region.&quot;</p>
