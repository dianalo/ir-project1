<p>Romanian soccer fans set fire to grandstands minutes before the start of a match between two rival Bucharest rival teams in one of the worst incidents in the growing problem of post-communist soccer violence.</p>
<p>About 30 fans were arrested but no one was seriously hurt. The match pitting first division Steaua against Dinamo Bucharest was briefly delayed. Steaua eventually won 3-1.</p>
<p>Police and soldiers who had been posted to the Steaua stadium in anticipation of trouble evacuated some 2,000 fans and herded them into car parks to find those responsible, officials said.</p>
<p>Marcel Puscas,  the Steaua president, said about 700 seats were destroyed after the fire broke out 10 minutes before the derby's scheduled kick-off with about 16,000 fans in attendance.</p>
<p>&quot;After the evacuation, police near the stadium questioned large groups of fans to determine who had caused the trouble,&quot; Puscas told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The vast majority of the 2,000 fans evacuated and the 30 now in detention were teenagers. They were taken to a district jail in special vans waiting outside the stadium. There was also a water cannon ready but police didn't use it.&quot;</p>
<p>Soccer violence has become a recurring problem in Romania in the seven years since the end of Communist rule.</p>
<p>Steaua, the traditional military team, and Dinamo, representing the police, have a long history of rivalry, with clashes frequently erupting between supporters. Steaua currently leads the Romanian first division.</p>
<p>Last month, first division side Craiova was banned for four matches after their fans smashed car windscreens in the southern town.</p>
<p>In the most violent incident of recent years, fans of a third Bucharest team, Rapid, hurled stones at a train carrying supporters back to Pitesti, northwest of the capital, in 1995. Three carriages were destroyed and one person was killed.</p>
<p>In the most celebrated incident between Steaua and Dinamo, dating from the Communist era, Ilie Ceausescu, deputy defence minister and brother of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, reversed a referee's decision and awarded the 1988 Romanian Cup to Steaua.</p>
