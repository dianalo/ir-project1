<p>Israel charged two policemen with aggravated assault and abuse of power on Sunday for the beatings of Palestinians captured on videotape, the Justice Ministry said.</p>
<p>The two paramilitary border policemen, Tsahi Shamaya, 19, and David Ben Abu, 20, were shown in an amateur video beating and abusing six Palestinians after detaining them in Jerusalem without work permits.</p>
<p>&quot;The accused dealt the detainees blows, punches, slaps and kicks to all parts of their bodies. The accused brutalised the detainees and degraded them by compelling three of them to do push-ups. One sat on the head of a detainee and rode him,&quot; a state charge sheet said.</p>
<p>It said one of the policemen punched a passerby in the face after he tried to convince the officers to cease their beatings.</p>
<p>Israel Radio said that the two had been expected to be kept under house arrest during legal proceedings but that prosecutors had asked the Jerusalem magistrate court to order they be held in custody.</p>
<p>The video, shot by a Palestinian from a nearby apartment last month and broadcast worldwide last week, embarrassed Israeli leaders and outraged Palestinians.</p>
<p>Palestinians have often complained of abuse by border policemen stationed throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the incident and said it was rare. Israeli human rights groups said the incident was rare only in that it was captured on video.</p>
