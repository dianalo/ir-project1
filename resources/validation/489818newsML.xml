<p>Human rights group Amnesty International said on Sunday the sedition trial of a Malaysian opposition figure showed that the government misuses repressive laws to silence critics.</p>
<p>Lim Guan Eng, a member of parliament from the west coast state of Malacca, was tried under Malaysia's Sedition Act and the Printing Presses and Publications Act for statements he made during the 1995 general election.</p>
<p>The trial, which began in January 1996, concluded on February 28 and a verdict is expected by the end of this month.</p>
<p>&quot;Amnesty International considers the charges against Lim Guan Eng were politically motivated to intimidate dissenting voices and to limit debate on an issue of genuine public concerned,&quot; the London-based group said in a statement.</p>
<p>Lim could face up to six years in jail and disqualification from parliament if found guilty.</p>
<p>Amnesty said it was concerned that if convicted &quot;Lim Guan Eng's constituents will be denied their elected representative simply because he spoke out on their behalf&quot;.</p>
<p>Malaysian police arrested Lim in 1995 after he publicly criticised the government's handling of allegations of statutory rape against the former chief minister of Malacca, Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik in 1994.</p>
<p>The attorney general decided not to charge Rahim saying there was insufficient evidence. The 15-year-old girl who made the accusation was detained by police for investigation of the complaint before being placed in a state home for wayward girls.</p>
<p>Lim was charged with &quot;maliciously printing&quot; a pamphlet that described the girl as an &quot;imprisoned victim&quot;.</p>
<p>Amnesty said the government continues to use security laws from the British colonial period &quot;for political purposes which far exceed the primary justification put forward by their colonial originators -- namely that these Acts served to preserve security and social stability at times of national emergency&quot;.</p>
<p>Amnesty said the government has used the laws to deter opposition politicians and non-governmental organisations from commenting on sensitive issues.</p>
<p>&quot;The sedition charges against Lim Guan Eng, apart from being an apparent move to silence a leading critic, appear to be part of an established government strategy of selectively using repressive laws in prominent cases to engender a wider public reluctance to criticise the authorities,&quot; Amnesty said.</p>
