<title>FINLAND: Eurosceptics take early lead in Finnish Europoll.</title>
<headline>Eurosceptics take early lead in Finnish Europoll.</headline>

<text>
<p>Finland's two firmest Eurosceptics took an early lead in the country's first direct European parliament elections on Sunday and the opposition Centre Party looked set to become the biggest party.</p>
<p>Early results from Finland's first poll for the Strasbourg-based parliament were based on a count of advance votes and first returns from polling stations, and represented about one-third of the 4.1 million eligible voters.</p>
<p>Turnout was low, estimated roughly at just over 60 percent against over 70 percent in general elections, Finnish television said.</p>
<p>Current Euro-MP Paavo Vayrynen -- a former foreign minister and the opposition Centre Party's top Eurosceptic -- and Esko Seppanen -- a rogue anti-European member of the governing Left Wing Alliance -- were standing first and second, it said.</p>
<p>Vayrynen said the mood during his campaign had been very critical of the European Union. &quot;The result reflects grass-roots opinion quite well,&quot; he told the STT news agency.</p>
<p>But Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen told reporters he did not see &quot;any significant Euro-protest&quot; in the result.</p>
<p>The advance count, which in the past has been a reliable indicator of final results, is based on voting in post offices by anyone who wants to cast their vote before polling day.</p>
<p>Early results from the European parliament elections pointed to a 26.0 percent showing for the opposition Centre Party, up from 19.8 in general elections in 1995, with the Social Democrats at 22.1 percent, down from 28.3.</p>
<p>In municipal elections, Lipponen's SDP, which leads the five-party coalition government, was also behind the Centre Party with 24.5 percent against the Centre's 25.1 percent.</p>
<p>Centre Party leader Esko Aho called the shift in his party's favour &quot;staggering&quot;, saying: &quot;It is quite clear that this has great significance for general policy.&quot;</p>
<p>Finland joined the European Union with Austria and Sweden in January 1995 after a referendum in which membership won 57 percent support, but this is the first direct poll for Euro MPs, who were previously named by parliament.</p>
<p>The vote comes a week after Finland linked its currency to Europe's stability mechanism, a major step towards a single currency. Only Seppanen had made this a major campaign issue.</p>
<p>Recent opinion polls said less than one-tenth of Finns felt very negative about EU membership, but about 60 percent opposed a single currency.</p>
<p>However, the results pointed to an unchanged distribution of seats. The Centre Party led the coalition that took Finland into Europe and had the biggest mandate with five of the country's 16 seats.</p>
