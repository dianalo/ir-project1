<p>U.S. Treasury bond futures are likely to consolidate a little in the near term as upward momentum was tapering off after last week's strong rally, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>Terence Gabriel, a technical analyst at I.D.E.A. Inc, said the daily candlestick chart showed that advances in June T-bonds were clearly slowing down after the big two-point breakout on April 29.</p>
<p>&quot;Since then, the bodies (of the candles) have been getting smaller and smaller...culminating in a tiny doji pattern yesterday,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Monday's candle had a barely visible body, with an open-close width of only 1/32 point.</p>
<p>The June contract stood at 110-2/32 at 1205 CDT/1705 GMT, only 1/32 above where it opened today and finished on Monday.</p>
<p>Shrinking candlestick bodies were more pronounced in Eurodollar futures, Gabriel added. September Eurodollars have been opening and closing near the 93.88-level ever since the big April 29 leap.</p>
<p>He also noted that the daily relative strength index and stochastic were turning lower at overbought levels, also suggesting a near-term correction.  </p>
<p>However, he stressed that the trend was still positive and the market was likely to eventually test the trendline from the December 1996 highs that came in at 111-17/32 today and was declining by about 2/32 a day.</p>
<p>&quot;It's possible that we're not going to get much of a breakdown and we are going to get a lateral continuation pattern,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jim Grauer, president of Omnitrage, said the daily stochastic will likely downcross today if the market fails to pierce last Friday's 110-10/32 high and pulls back from its 110-7/32 high touched overnight.  </p>
<p>But he, too, was positive on bonds in the longer term because the weekly stochastic had upcrossed in deeply oversold area last week and the monthly was close to making an upcross.</p>
<p>When the daily stochastic refreshes itself after a 20-day downcycle toward the end of May, the monthly will likely have upcrossed, presenting a positive confluence of the daily, weekly and monthly stochastics, Grauer said.</p>
<p>He added that such a scenario coincided with growing expectation the Federal Reserve would be finishing, or close to finishing, the present credit-tightening cycle with a rate hike at the May 20 Federal Open Market Committee.  </p>
<p>&quot;If they raise (interest rates), the market is going to embrace it. If they raise half a point, I think the market is going to be overjoyed,&quot; Grauer said, noting that a 3/4 point tightening in November 1994 was followed by the start of a strong bull market a few days later.</p>
<p>He said the Fed had probably learned a lesson from the 1994 tightening sequence, in which it was forced to make bigger rate hikes toward the end of the cycle because the small increases in the early stages were insufficient.</p>
