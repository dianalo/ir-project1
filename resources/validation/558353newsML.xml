<p>British scientists said on Monday they had found more evidence that a virus could cause certain types of cancer.</p>
<p>They said cases of acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), the biggest cause of leukaemia in children, clustered in the summer in their study of 4,200 people.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever is causing this cancer is also seasonal,&quot; said Padmanabhan Badrinath of Cambridge University, who worked on the study. &quot;We think the potential candidate is a viral infection.&quot;</p>
<p>The study, published in the Cancer Research Campaign charity's British Journal of Cancer, found that ALL was 40 percent more likely to be diagnosed between May and October than in other months.</p>
<p>Their study covered all cases of cancer reported in a region of eastern England between 1971 and 1994.</p>
<p>Other studies have tried to find a seasonal link to cancer but have had mixed results. Badrinath said the pattern was only clear in ALL.</p>
<p>This made sense, he added, as ALL had been identified as a possible candidate for having a viral cause.</p>
<p>ALL affects one in 100,000 children. Victims are lethargic and feverish, pale, irritable and have joint and bone pain. They are anaemic and their immune systems are damaged.</p>
<p>A few cases seem to have genetic factors and there was a six-fold increase in leukaemia, mostly ALL, in Japanese children exposed to radiation from atomic bombs in World War Two.</p>
<p>Several studies have shown a small increase in ALL among children living near power plants or nuclear reprocessing plants.</p>
<p>One British researcher, Dr Leo Kinlen, has suggested this could be due to workers coming in to relatively isolated communities to build the plant and carrying a virus with them.</p>
<p>Other studies have linked ALL to human t-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-1). But Badrinath said: &quot;We do not know what virus it is and viral infection is only one possible cause.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;The next step should be to confirm this and identify the possible agent.&quot;</p>
<p>Badrinath said ALL was clearly seasonal and there could be no other explanation for the cluster of cases in summer.</p>
<p>&quot;ALL is quite sudden in onset,&quot; he said. &quot;It only takes a week or two weeks for them to present. We found a 40 percent summer excess which can't be due to chance.&quot;</p>
