<p>Expressing disappointment over the failure of authorities to solve the murder of his six-year-old daughter JonBenet, John Ramsey Wednesday said he would take out advertisements in local newspapers describing the profile of his child's killer.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that with the help of one key phone call, this killer can be brought to justice,&quot; John Ramsey said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We will begin a series of newspaper ads and fliers to alert people to the elements of the behavioural profile and ask them to contact our investivators with information about persons who might fit the profile,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the past seven months, I have grown increasingly frustrated with some of the investigating authorities who have limited their investigation into the murder of my daughter, JonBenet Ramsey, to me and members of my family,&quot; his statement said.</p>
<p>Soon after the murder, suspicion fell on the parents because there was no sign of forced entry into the home. When the Ramseys initially refused to speak with the police public opinion turned against them.</p>
<p>No arrests have been made and no suspects named in the seven-month-long investigation.</p>
<p>Boulder, Colo. police were not available to comment.</p>
<p>The body of the young beauty pageant winner was found Dec. 26 in the family's home in Boulder by her father after her mother Patricia said she found a ransom note demanding $118,000.</p>
<p>The statement said the killer may have been suffering from stress in the weeks before the murder and since the murder may be paying extraordinary attention to news accounts of the case. The person may have turned to religion and increased alcohol or drug consumption, according to a profile that private investigators have fitted together for the Ramseys.</p>
