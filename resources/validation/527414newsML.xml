<headline>FOCUS-Oil and wheat retreat from recent highs.</headline>

<p>Oil prices shied away from a recent rally and wheat was slightly easier on Tuesday as weather and supply concerns were seen as largely factored into the markets, at least for now.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in world commodity trading coffee also slipped back from a surge last week, while gold remained trapped within its range of the last few days. Copper and aluminium were stronger against the backdrop of tight nearby supply.</p>
<p>World oil prices came off after early gains sparked by the possibility of lower exports from Nigeria and heightened tensions between Iraq and the United States, as traders said the underlying market tone still remained soft.</p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell Group's Nigerian unit said it had declared force majeure on the export of Bonny crude oil because of a strike by contractors that handle the berthing and loading of tankers.</p>
<p>Shell said there would be delays loading tankers but that no cancellations were expected.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iraqi helicopters arrived safely at Iraq's southern border with Saudi Arabia to pick up Moslem pilgrims, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The White House on Monday had urged Iraq to reconsider the flight, saying it would &quot;respond appropriately&quot; to any such flights within the &quot;no-fly&quot; zone.</p>
<p>U.S. Defence Secretary William Cohen said Iraq could not flout no-fly rules by arbitrarily sending helicopters to pick up the pilgrims, but it might be eligible for a humanitarian exemption allowing the flights if it followed proper procedure.</p>
<p>Benchmark North Sea Brent blend crude oil futures for June fell back to touch $18.03 a barrel in London's Tuesday afternoon, having reached an intra-day high of $18.64.</p>
<p>Weakness in the wheat market after a strong advance recently were seen linked to the idea that the markets were severely overbought after recent sharp gains on the back of freezing weather conditions and floods in North America and a long dry spell in much of Europe.</p>
<p>Chicago Board of Trade soft red winter wheat futures opened with moderate losses in Chicago, trading on the idea that any deterioration in the U.S. hard red winter wheat crop had already been factored into prices.</p>
<p>Damage from a recent freeze in U.S Central Plains was still being assessed, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Monday the winter wheat crop was 46 percent good to excellent as of Sunday, below the 63 percent in that category the previous week.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the damage is already in the market,&quot; said one Chicago floor trader.</p>
<p>CBOT soft red winter wheat futures retreated to $4.36 a bushel in London's afternoon.</p>
<p>Copper was seen stronger in a tight market, exacerbated by a continuing strike at the Escondida mine, the world's largest copper mine, in Chile.</p>
<p>Traders were still cautious about being short in the market as stalled labour talks at Phelps Dodge's Chino mine in New Mexico were due to resume on Thursday and Friday, and the strike at Escondida was affecting some stages of the production process.</p>
<p>&quot;It's probably not Escondida on its own that has caused prices and backwardation to rise. But it has heightened awareness of a continual drawdowns of stocks we have been seeing. It all mounts up,&quot; said analyst Martin Squires of Rudolf Wolff.</p>
<p>Copper continued to  drive higher through the $2,300 a tonne level on Tuesday after drifting in a lower range in recent days. Aluminium looked firmer around $1,600 a tonne.</p>
<p>Coffee futures of the robusta type ended trading in London at the day's low of $1,628 per tonne, dragged down as arabica coffee futures in New York headed lower.</p>
<p>Traders said the reversal was expected after Monday's meteoric rise to new contract highs for the May contract in New York.</p>
<p>Gold remained trapped in the narrow range of $340 to $345 it stalked for much of last week, running into selling pressure each time it surfaced above $342.00 an ounce.</p>
<p>One dealer noted producer selling at $343.00. He expected that producers were likely to hedge more and further out.</p>
<p>&quot;Each time it gets up there ($343) it gets stopped. It looks like the market is going to go and test lower levels. If it doesn't hold above $336 then I think we'll see it down to $300,&quot; said the dealer.</p>
<p>Fears of interest rate hikes in the United States and rising stock prices are also keeping hot money away from the gold market.</p>
