<p>Spanish bonds welcomed a widely expected official rate cut on Thursday, and analysts said bonds could climb even higher if the European convergence process continues.</p>
<p>The market has hit record highs since August, as dealers increasingly become convinced the peseta can join a European single currency from the start in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;Another rate cut is likely before year-end, but what is more important for the bond market is the convergence process,&quot; said Luca Jellinek, economist at Paribas Banque in London.</p>
<p>Spain's path towards a unified Europe was being paved by a positive falling trend in the budget deficit and inflation, foreign rate exchange stability and above all, political will, he added.</p>
<p>The 10-year spread over German Bunds has fallen dramatically from 440 basis points in September 1995 to 172 basis points on Tuesday. And nobody expects it to stop there.</p>
<p>&quot;The sheer momentum on the spreads is still there...we'll probably see the Spanish spread moving towards 150 basis points,&quot; Phillis Reed, economist at BZW in London, told Reuters Financial Television (RFTV).</p>
<p>But bigger spreads at the short-end of the curve, such as 328 basis points on the two-year segment or 214 on the five year, attest the market is less convinced by European economic and monetary union (EMU) in the short-term, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market thinks the longer the horizon, the more likely is the union,&quot; Jellinek said.</p>
<p>More people were convinced the short-end of the curve could gain further if the convergence process was right on schedule.</p>
<p>On Thursday, shortly after the Bank of Spain cut its key money market rate by 50 basis points, the three-year 7.80-percent bond was trading at 102.13, yielding 6.83 percent, versus Wednesday's close at 101.99.</p>
<p>The 10-year December future contract was at 107.50, 12 basis points above Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>Analysts said another key was what other European nations will do with rates, after the last Bundesbank repo rate cut from 3.30 to 3.00 percent on August 21 triggered a spate of rate reductions.</p>
<p>Benjamin Serrano, economist at Analistas Financieros in Madrid, said the Bank of Spain &quot;had scope to cut one-half point, and they took advantage of it. The Bundesbank's cut in August gave the Bank of Spain room.&quot;</p>
<p>But European central banks' room for manoeuvre is narrow due to the inflation criteria imposed by the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>Taming the inflation trend means they have to keep short-term interest rates relatively high while trying to hinder any currency appreciation.</p>
<p>After the Spanish consumer price index came in lower than expected in August at 3.7 percent, the market is now focusing on the September inflation data due on October 11.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very likely the Bank of Spain will wait to see an inflation rate around 3.3 percent and then, they will cut again,&quot; said Jellinek.</p>
<p>Others said a cut could come even sooner.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank of Spain will do its damnedest to keep (the peseta) from gaining much further,&quot; said Henrik Lumholdt, chief economist at Bank of America in Madrid.</p>
<p>At 1045 GMT, the peseta was trading at 84.09/11 against the German mark, almost unchanged from Wednesday.</p>
