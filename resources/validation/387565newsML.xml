<title>RUSSIA: Russian PM to check strategic missile systems.</title>

<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will visit the command centre of Russia's strategic missiles on Friday to check the reliability of the systems that control Moscow's nuclear forces, Interfax news agency said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin is expected to check the efficiency of communications down the chain of command and the reliability of systems preventing unauthorised access to nuclear weapons, it said.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin, who has ordered the checks, will in due course receive a report containing proposals to be taken on the basis of Chernomyrdin's findings.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted a military expert as saying that Russia's strategic missile system is currently in a state of &quot;full battle readiness&quot; and is functioning effectively.</p>
<p>&quot;However the failure to strengthen and modernise the system could mean that early in the next century a series of components, including information infrastructure, will be in a critical state,&quot; Interfax quoted the expert as saying.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Igor Rodionov has recently issued dire warnings about the decrepit state of the once-mighty Russian military and has called into question Moscow's long-term ability to control its nuclear forces.</p>
<p>Russian Public Television said this week that communications were the biggest problem affecting Russia's strategic missile systems, saying the quality was often little better than that of an average telephone network in Russia.</p>
<p>Last year a leaked Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report, quoted in the Washington Post, said controls in Russia had become less strict because of dramatic social change and accompanying economic problems and low morale in the military.</p>
<p>But the report was also quoted as saying the chance of an unauthorised launch or blackmail remained low.</p>
<p>Rodionov and Igor Sergeyev, commander-in-chief of the strategic missile forces, will accompany Chernomyrdin on his visit to the central command on Friday.</p>
