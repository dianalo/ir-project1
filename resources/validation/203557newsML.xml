<p>Two names have surfaced as favorites for appointment to the Bank of France's Monetary Policy Council when a double vacancy appears at the end of the year, the daily Le Monde reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Jean-Rene Bernard, an advisor to former French president Georges Pompidou and Pierre Guillen, the honorary president of the French mining and metalurgical union were the two most likely candidates, Le Monde said.</p>
<p>The mandates of Jean Boissonat and Bruno de Maulde, appointed to the Council when it was founded in 1994, will expire at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>The heads of the Senate, National Assembly and the Economic and Social Council are to draw up a list of six candidates from which the government will choose the two replacements.</p>
<p>The appointments are considered important because the choice of candidates will be seen as a measure of the government's commitment to the strong franc policy championed by Bank of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet.</p>
<p>Le Monde reported it was unlikely that President Jacques Chirac, who has de facto veto rights over the appointments, would approve the reappointment of either Boissonat or de Maulde, since that would be seen as a vote of confidence in Trichet, with whom Chirac has chilly relations.</p>
<p>Le Monde said Chirac would probably push for candidates who were &quot;neutral&quot; from a policy point of view but with the authority to stand up to Trichet.</p>
<p>The end result of such of appointments would be broadly unchanged monetary policy in France, with its goals of price stability and the construction of a single European currency, Le Monde said.</p>
<p>But Chirac, were he to execute such a strategy, would hope to inject some sensitivity to the real economy into the debate with the new appointments.</p>
<p>Lionel Stoleru, a former minister and Robert Pelletier, managing director of the French association of credit companies, were two other names Le Monde reported as possible candidates.</p>
