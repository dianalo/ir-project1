<p>At age 94, on the brink of becoming the longest-serving senator ever, Strom Thurmond says daily exercise, morning prunes and a zest for life keep him going every day.</p>
<p>A stalwart conservative symbol of Deep South politics for more than a half-century, Thurmond last year became the oldest ever senator.</p>
<p>This Sunday, he adds another longevity mark, becoming the longest-serving senator in American history, surpassing the 42-year record set by Carl Hayden of Arizona on Jan. 2, 1969.</p>
<p>Thurmond plans on marking the day by giving a speech back home in South Carolina, not far from Edgefield, where he was born in 1902.</p>
<p>Many around the Capitol believe Thurmond is past his prime and his chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee is semi-ceremonial, with younger colleagues doing the hard work.</p>
<p>But saying the felt &quot;like a million dollars,&quot; he held an energetic and funny news conference Thursday celebrating the milestone, and said he has given no thought to retirement.</p>
<p>&quot;I intend to serve my term out,&quot; he said, meaning he could mark his 100th birthday in office.</p>
<p>Thurmond said he rises each day and does 20 minutes of calisthenics, including pushups, followed by 20 minutes on a stationary bike and some stretching.</p>
<p>Breakfast religiously includes &quot;a half-banana, a half-apple, prunes and grapes.&quot; He fills out the meal, alternating between oatmeal one day, and artifical eggs, grits and cheese the next.</p>
<p>Thurmond doesn't just show up in the Senate every day. He shows up early. He is president pro tempore of the Senate -- a largely ceremonial post that puts him third in line for presidential succession after the vice president and speaker of the House -- and he opens the Senate session every day.</p>
<p>His genes, he acknowledged, probably have something to do with his vigour. That, he said, &quot;and an optimistic attitude toward life.&quot;</p>
