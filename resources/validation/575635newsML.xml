<p>The mayor in the main city of Romania's Transylvania region threatened on Monday to picket a visit by the Hungarian president unless he agreed to renounce what nationalists say are still claims to Romanian territory.</p>
<p>Gheorghe Funar, a colourful nationalist who has twice run unsuccessfully for president, demanded that Hungarian President Arpad Goncz formally recognise Transylvania's 1918 attachment to Romania before his visit to Cluj at the end of this month.</p>
<p>He also urged Goncz to withdraw what he said were published remarks saying Transylvania was an inseparable part of any Hungarian state and to atone publicly for alleged wartime misdeeds against Romanians and Jews.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Goncz can come to Transylvania's spiritual capital and be received at city hall only after he formally recognises Romania's unification of 1918,&quot; Funar said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;If the visit goes ahead without these conditions being fulfilled, the local council mandates the mayor to organise public meetings and protest rallies.&quot;</p>
<p>The statement, signed by the mayor, is to be submitted for approval this week to the local council in Cluj, a city of 300,000 people 400 km (250 miles) north of Bucharest.</p>
<p>A quarter of Cluj's residents are ethnic Hungarians and both groups view the city as the region's main cultural centre.</p>
<p>In Budapest, the Hungarian president's office refused to comment on the statement.</p>
<p>Goncz's visit, which includes stops in Bucharest and Cluj, is the first to Romania by a top Hungarian leader since the neighbours signed a post-communist treaty last year ending longstanding rivalries and mutual suspicion.</p>
<p>Transylvania was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire but reverted to Romania after the empire's collapse at the end of World War One.</p>
<p>Adolf Hitler gave the region back to fascist Hungary in 1940 and local wartime leaders killed and forced into exile tens of thousands of Transylvanian Romanians and Jews.</p>
<p>The area was returned to Romania at the end of the war.</p>
<p>Funar has led nationalist campaigns to curb the rights of Transylvania's 1.6 million Hungarians, including the use of Hungarian at the local university and in administrative offices and the posting of bilingual signs.</p>
<p>He opposes plans to open a Hungarian consulate in Cluj which Goncz is certain to discuss during his visit.</p>
<p>Funar has lost political clout nationally in recent months after being ousted as leader of the Romanian National Unity Party, but still wields influence in Transylvania.</p>
