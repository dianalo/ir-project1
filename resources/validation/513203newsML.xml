<title>AUSTRALIA: Tasmania legislators move to scrap anti-sodomy laws.</title>

<p>Legislators in the Australian state of Tasmania on Wednesday approved in principle the scrapping of the conservative island community's harsh laws against sodomy.</p>
<p>Tasmania's tiny upper House of the state parliament narrowly voted for a bill to repeal the existing laws, unique in Australia for making anal sex a crime punishable by up to 21 years' jail.</p>
<p>A packed public gallery clapped and cheered as the 19-member Legislative Council, which had three times before blocked moves to scrap the laws, resolved by a two-vote margin on Wednesday night to ditch sections 122 and 123 of the state Criminal Code.</p>
<p>The sections outlaw consenting sexual intercourse &quot;against the order of nature&quot; and &quot;indecent practice between male persons&quot;. They have been condemned by the United Nations, international human rights bodies and AIDS groups.</p>
<p>The vote followed almost seven hours of emotional debate in the council. The Criminal Code Amendment Bill must now survive another, final vote expected on Thursday before it becomes law, but never before has such a bill reached this stage.</p>
<p>The lower chamber, the House of Assembly, has resolved to scrap the laws four times in the past five years. But the council has the final say on all state legislation.</p>
<p>Homosexual activists, who have long lobbied for the laws to dropped and had sought to challenge them in the High Court, hailed the vote as a historic victory for Tasmanian homosexuals.</p>
<p>Tasmanian Gay and Lesbian Rights Group spokesman Rodney Croome told reporters after the vote that for the first time in Tasmania's history, a majority of legislators had given in-principle support for homosexual law reform.</p>
<p>But he warned that amendments to the bill could yet make the victory hollow.</p>
<p>Tasmanian Health Minister Peter McKay, a councillor who has previously supported the anti-sodomy laws, said he felt bitter public debate over the laws had fostered a climate of hate.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want my family to grow up in an atmosphere of bitterness and hate,&quot; McKay told parliament. &quot;We're just feeding hate in our community, and I don't want to be part of that.&quot;</p>
