<p>The U.N. World Food Program intends to appeal on Wednesday for 129,000 tonnes of food, worth $45.7 million, to aid malnourished North Korean children, sources at the United Nations said.</p>
<p>The appeal, on behalf of hundreds of thousands of children under 6 years of age, is to be made in Geneva by Catherine Bertini, executive director of the Rome-based agency. It follows films she showed of children reduced to pitiful, skeletal figures, too weak even to eat emergency rations sent to them.</p>
<p>The WFP earlier this year asked for 200,000 tonnes of food, worth about $95 million, all of which has been raised. Bertini has said the country requires 1.8 million tonnes to avoid large-scale starvation.</p>
<p>The United States is expected to announce later this week its contribution to the new appeal for children, having waited for Bertini to issue it, the sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation in North Korea is getting worse, and we are seeing children who are just skin and bone, who have had nothing to eat and who cannot even consume the ground-up corn that we have available for them, &quot; Bertini said in Rome on Tuesday when she distributed the film to media organizations.</p>
<p>&quot;We are having to find increased amounts of special baby food that is highly nutritious to be able to feed malnourished children,&quot; Bertini, an American, said.</p>
<p>The agency has become increasingly alarmed in recent weeks at the food shortages, caused by two years of flooding that ruined farmland in the country of 23 million people. The damage was particularly severe because trees had been cleared for firewood and agriculture.</p>
<p>People have survived on bark, dried vegetable leaves, ground corncobs and ground sweet potato stalks. Small, irregular farm markets had formerly provided some food, but most have closed as supplies have dwindled.</p>
<p>UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund, has estimated that malnutrition is affecting 800,000 children under 5 years of age, or 37 percent of that age group.</p>
<p>Ole Gronning, the Pyongyang representative of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said last month that government food stocks throughout the country had virtually been exhausted.</p>
<p>He said more than 5 million North Koreans were near starvation and could die in coming months.</p>
<p>Contributions of food aid to Korea have been fraught with politics and at times have been indirectly linked to peace talks between North and South Korea and the United States.</p>
<p>Dire economic problems and a lack of friends in the post-communist world pushed North Korea into a breakthrough agreement earlier this month to start talks with South Korea, the United States and China on a peace treaty for the Korean peninsula, U.S. officials say.</p>
