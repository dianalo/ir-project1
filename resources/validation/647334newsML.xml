<p>The National Bank of Poland President Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz on Monday said a change in official interest rates was unlikely in the near-term as credit growth remained a key issue for the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Credit growth is too strong,&quot; Gronkiewicz-Waltz told Reuters in an interview, when asked about the central bank's most pressing problem. She was in Basle attending the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) annual meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;I have increased the reserve requirements twice (this year) to curb credit growth...(and) for the moment I am waiting for the results,&quot; she added.  </p>
<p>Gronkiewicz-Waltz said the central bank would likely refrain from increasing rates because such a move would cause unwanted foreign capital inflows.</p>
<p>&quot;If I increased rates I could have a problem with capital inflow,&quot; Gronkiewicz-Waltz said.</p>
<p>On the other hand she said a reduction in rates would not be possible as this would create a problem with money supply, and added that there was too much money in the system.</p>
<p>The central bank last increased obligatory reserves on zloty term deposits and all foreign currency deposits to 11 and five percent respectively at the start of May. @</p>
<p>In February, the central bank increased reseves on zloty call deposits to 20 percent and to four percent on foreign currency deposits.</p>
<p>The central bank's official interest rates, now at 25 percent for the lombard and 22 percent for the discount, have remained unchanged from July last year.</p>
