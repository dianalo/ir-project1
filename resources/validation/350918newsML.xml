<p>The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Monday forecast real GDP growth for 1997 of 4.0-5.0 percent, after expected growth of 4.1 percent for 1996.</p>
<p>It added in a statement containing a wide range of economic forecasts that average annual inflation should ease to 7.5-8.0 percent from 8.8 percent in 1996 while the current account deficit should grow to 137-145 billion crowns from an estimated 110.6 billion crown shortfall in 1996.  </p>
<p>The CSU said that it forecast the trade deficit to widen to 202-212 billion crowns from a shortfall of 160.3 billion crowns last year.</p>
<p>Growth in average nominal wages -- a factor the central bank has warned must be brought under control if inflation targets are to be met -- is expected to be 14.5-16.5 percent, down from the CSU's 1996 forecast increase of 18.4 percent.</p>
<p>The CSU said that it sees unemployment rising in 1997 to between 3.6-4.0 percent, after finishing last year at 3.5 percent.  </p>
<p>The statement said the central bank's money tightening measures in 1996 helped influence the slowdown of GDP growth, &quot;(But we) expect GDP growth to accelerate in 1997. The reasons for the slowdown of growth in 1996 are only expected to be temporary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The growth (however) of GDP may not be seen until the second half of 1997 due to the influence of investment into new technologies and some pro-export measures,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Czech imports grew by some 12.7 percent in 1996, due in large part to firms investing in new machinery and materials, badly-needed as part of the country's economic restructuring.</p>
<p>Meanwhile exports stagnated, rising only 3.5 percent for the year. But the CSU said it expects exports to grow 4.5-6.5 percent in 1997, while import growth should ease slightly to 9-12 percent.</p>
<p>The CSU said the current account deficit should grow to about 8.6-9.1 percent of GDP in 1997, up from an expected 7.8 percent level last year.</p>
