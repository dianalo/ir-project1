<p>Usinor Sacilor chairman Francis Mer said on Tuesday he expected improved earnings in the first half of 1997 when compared to the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;All the conditions are there so that the first half of 1997 will show an improvement when compared to the mediocre figure that I just announced,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;The horizon cleared up during the summer but it is only in the first half of 1997 that we will see an improvement in results,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>But Mer cautioned that 1997 would remain a difficult year for the steel sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We are at the end of a disagreeable period but we are not at the beginning of a very sharp upturn,&quot; Mer said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is obvious that the year 1997 in our core sector (steel) will be a year of transition, a difficult year, but it will be less difficult than 1996,&quot; he said at the news conference.</p>
<p>Earlier, the company reported that first half net attributable profit dived to 833 million francs from 2.36 billion francs on turnover that fell to 37.39 billion francs from 41.63 billion.</p>
<p>It warned that 1996 second half results would be weaker than those of the first half but would still be positive.</p>
<p>&quot;Taking into account the seasonal nature of Usinor Sacilor's business, the group currently expects the results for the second half to be weaker than the first but to remain clearly positive,&quot; the company said in a statement that accompanied the results</p>
