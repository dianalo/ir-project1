<headline>Dlr/mark ends lower in U.S., victim of asset drop.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-11</dateline>

<p>The dollar dropped sharply against most European currencies, falling victim to a steep decline in U.S. stocks and bonds as a nervous Wall Street questioned whether its record-breaking run was faltering, dealers said.</p>
<p>Wednesday's broad sell-off revived fears that washed over the markets last week after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan questioned whether central bankers should be concerned about the dizzying height that stock prices had reached.  </p>
<p>Dealers said trade in dollar/mark mirrored movements in the Dow Jones industrial average stock market index.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost all of the dollar trade activity tracked the Dow. Even when the Dow tried to stage a small recovery this afternoon, the dollar followed suit,&quot; said Mike Malpede, senior foreign exchange analyst at Refco Group Ltd.</p>
<p>The dollar touched a low of 1.5342 marks in early trade after opening at 1.5437/42 marks. The greenback attempt to recapture the important 1.54 mark level in the early afternoon, but failed and closed at 1.5376/81 marks.  </p>
<p>Against the yen, the dollar inched higher in U.S. trade to end at 112.92/02 from 112.83/88 at the open, but fell from its 113.32/42 close on Tuesday. Dealers remarked they were surprised at the dollar's resilience against the yen in the U.S. session and could muster no concrete explanation beyond strong buying on the dips.</p>
<p>The Dow opened off sharply, falling nearly 120 points by mid-morning. Stocks tried, but failed, to pare early losses until late in the session. The Dow crawled higher to end down 71 points. U.S. Treasuries also suffered heavy losses, closing shy of a two point drop.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was no question once the asset market opened the way it did, the dollar was going to trade lower,&quot; said Bob Near, a vice-president at Bank of New York.</p>
<p>&quot;The drop just underscores the fact that the markets are extremely skittdish in the wake of Greenspan's comments on (last) Thursday.&quot;</p>
<p>Market participants have fretted that the Dow, which has advanced by nearly a third this year, could be headed for a major correction.  </p>
<p>Market jitters started in Asian and European markets due to a column in the Wall Street Journal which questioned whether Japanese financial institutions were losing interest in U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>Several large investors later bought Swiss francs for marks and dollars, putting additional pressure on the U.S. currency.</p>
<p>The dollar also suffered as dealers flocked to the yen and sold the Australian dollar following a Reserve Bank of Australia official cash rate cut to 6.0 percent from 6.5 percent.  </p>
<p>Some dealers interpreted the rate cut as a signal Australian officials want their currency lower.</p>
<p>Despite the fall in the dollar on Wednesday, dealers remained optimistic that the dollar's recent rally against most continential European currencies will soon resume.</p>
<p>&quot;The long-run view according to technical analysts and others is that the dollar should go up and that has not really changed, but right now the dollar looks very offered on the Dow Jones and bond market,&quot; said Hans Boman, chief spot dealer at Swedbank in New York.</p>
<p>In other trading, the dollar closed lower at 1.3090/00 Swiss franc compared to 1.3180/90 at Wednesday's open and Canadian $1.3600/05 from $C1.3631/36. Sterling fell to $1.6527/37 from $1.6545/55. The Australian dollar</p>
