<p>&quot;The market is firmer today, buying interest is seen both among Russian and Western operators,&quot; National Reserve Bank dealer Andrei Ivanov-Golitsyn said.</p>
<p>He added arbitrage trading was mainly seen today, with banks selling one tranche and buying another.</p>
<p>Dealers said the third, fourth and sixth tranches were traded most actively. They were meeting resistance at 84.25, 61.25 and 49.15 respectively.</p>
<p>Dealers said trading was more active compared with the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>&quot;News that Russia will pay some of the tsarist debts provoked some demand from London operators. The market has become lively after a pause,&quot; Sberbank dealer Pavel Sool said.</p>
<p>Russian and French prime ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and Alain Juppe reached the debt deal on Tuesday at Paris talks which required Moscow to pay $400 million to holders of the bonds, which were issued before the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.</p>
