<p>Greece's CPI will treat heating oil as a seasonal good for the first time ever this May, ignoring a tax hike and helping push inflation lower, the general secretary of the National Statistics Service (NSS) told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Heating oil will be treated as a seasonal good this year and therefore May's CPI will not reflect the tax hike in heating oil,&quot; said Nickos Karavitis, general secretary at NSS.</p>
<p>Greece regularly raises the consumption tax on heating oil in May and cuts it in October.</p>
<p>Asked to gauge the impact on May's CPI from the change in the treatment of heating oil, Karavitis said he had no estimate. But he admitted that the non-inclusion of heating oil tax in CPI computations would help the disinflation process.</p>
<p>Press reports see inflation falling below 5.5 percent year-on-year in May from 5.9 percent in April.</p>
<p>Headline inflation eased to 5.9 percent year-on-year in April from 6.0 percent in March.</p>
<p>But core inflation which does not include food and energy prices was unchanged at 7.5 percent year-on-year in April according to foreign bank estimates.</p>
<p>Official figures showed that the price of heating oil surged 31.4 percent month-on-month in May 1996 when the old consumer price index using 1988 as its base year was in place. Heating oil weighed 1.753 percent in the old CPI.</p>
<p>Greece introduced a new CPI re-based to 1994 in January 1997. Heating oil carries a weight of 2.23 percent in the new CPI.</p>
<p>Economists have said that the newly constructed CPI helped lower inflation by 0.3 percent. --Dimitris Kontogiannis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
