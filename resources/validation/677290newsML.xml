<p>South Africa's textile industry said on Friday that the beating it had taken on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange since the beginning of last year due to a rise in illegal imports and a sharp cut in tarriff protection was overdone.</p>
<p>Since February 12, 1996 the clothing, footwear and textiles index has fallen from a record high of 1,517.7 points to 883.7 points. In the same period it underperformed the all-share index by 55 percent.</p>
<p>Textile Federation president Mervyn King told a media briefing that despite the tough times, companies still had confidence in the future.</p>
<p>Frame Group Holdings , of which he is chairman, had invested 300 million rand to upgrade and modernise its factory.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important to understand that we have confidence in the industry. We have put our money where our mouth is because we believe there is massive growth potential in the future,&quot; King said</p>
<p>&quot;Our mills are full and we have started manufacturing 24 hours a day,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>King said the market rating given to textile companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange was too low. Romatex Ltd was trading at a 73 percent discount to net asset value while Frame was trading at a 64 percent discount.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the market rating is quiet unwarranted,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Government started a seven-year programme in 1996 to reduce tarriffs in the industry to about 22 percent from 39 percent on fabrics, 15 percent from 28 percent on yarns and 30 percent from 49 percent on household textiles.</p>
<p>The World Trade Organisation had recommended a 12-year phasing down period.</p>
<p>The industry, which has an annual output of nine billion rand, was using the phasing-down period to upgrade its technology and was investing about three billion rand in new equipment, King said.</p>
<p>Capital expenditure in 1995 was 800 million rand, grew to 1.1 billion rand in 1996 and was forecast at 700 million rand this year. About 400 million rand would be spent on upgrading worker skills and management methods.</p>
<p>&quot;We have moved from a labour intensive to a technologically driven industry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>King said the capex and training efforts would improve efficiencies, reduce unit costs and lead to quicker response times and improved stockturns.</p>
<p>The industry is the sixth largest employer in South Africa with 75,000 jobs and rationalisation had resulted in loss of 3,000 jobs over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>&quot;There is going to be rationalisation. The world is getting smaller and competition greater. While the number of (industry) players might shrink, we will become significant players in the world market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he acknowledged that illegal imports resulting from a collapse of customs controls were putting pressure on margins.</p>
<p>&quot;If the flow of illegal imports is not stemmed and customs controls not dramatically improved, the restructuring efforts of South Africa's manufacturing base will be undermined and manufacturers are likely to be irreversibly damaged, resulting in severe job losses,&quot; he said.</p>
