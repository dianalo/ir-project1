<p>Southeast Asian nations expressed their concern on Wednesday over cuts in aid to the region by the United States at the opening of a two-day meeting.</p>
<p>Indonesian co-chairman of the 13th ASEAN-U.S. Dialogue, Izhar Ibrahim, said the seven members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) still saw development cooperation as an integral part of relations between Washington and the group.</p>
<p>&quot;ASEAN appreciates the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) contributions and its support for ASEAN projects. However, I would like to reiterate the concern of ASEAN due to diminishing USAID commitment towards ASEAN,&quot; Ibrahim said in an opening address.</p>
<p>&quot;The funding through the Private Investment Trade Opportunities ended in June 1995, leaving only the Environmental Improvement Programme as a funding force,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Ibrahim said ASEAN could understand that the United States was developing an economic and commercial relationship with other countries and organisations.</p>
<p>&quot;But I would also like to stress here that three Southeast Asian countries, namely Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar (Burma) will join ASEAN in the not-too-distant future,&quot; said Ibrahim, who is also Indonesia's foreign ministry's director-general for political affairs.</p>
<p>The U.S. delegation leader, Under-Secretary of State Winston Lord, did not address the aid issue in his opening remarks after Ibrahim's statement.</p>
<p>Lord said the dialogue, being held on the Indonesian special industrial zone and resort island of Batam near Singapore, would cover political and economic issues including trade, investment, the Korean peninsula, the South China Sea and the United States' regional security role.</p>
<p>Cambodia and Burma would also be touched on, he told the opening session.</p>
<p>ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
