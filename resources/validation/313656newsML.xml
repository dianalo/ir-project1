<p>Thai Airways International Plc said on Thursday it will weigh options on business expansion in the next few years after a government request for the carrier to change its aircraft acquisition plans.</p>
<p>At a board meeting on Thursday, Thai Airways management was due to review a government guideline for it to lease, instead of buy, 21 new planes between 1996-2000.</p>
<p>The government owns 93 percent of Thai Airways.</p>
<p>Government officials said the change would trim Thailand's short-term spending on foreign exchange and help narrow its current account deficit.</p>
<p>Under its original expansion plan, the airline planned to invest about 68.8 billion baht ($2.75 billion) on the planes.</p>
<p>Thai Airways had planned to place orders for six Boeing 777-300s, four Boeing 737-400/500s, two Boeing 747-400s, five Airbus 300-600S, and four Airbus 330-300s.</p>
<p>Thai Airways executives said early this month that leasing aircraft may not be a good business decision because it would raise long-term operating costs. They also cited problems of finding specific aircraft available for leasing.  </p>
<p>But a Thai Airways executive, who declined to be identified, hinted that the airline's management might compromise by agreeing to lease 10 of the 21 planes, especially those originally earmarked for delivery in 1997 and 1998.</p>
<p>He proposed that options on the remaining 11 planes be left open as the airline could still buy them later when the country's current account position improved.</p>
<p>Thailand's current account deficit widened to a six-year high of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product in 1996 from 8.1 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>Market analysts have expressed scepticism on another idea proposed by finance ministry officials for Thai Airways to consider acquiring the planes through a counter-trade arrangement.</p>
<p>The analysts said counter-trade deals are complicated and time consuming.</p>
<p>The executive said another option would be for Thai Airways to delay retiring some planes in its current fleet.</p>
