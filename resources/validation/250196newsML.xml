<p>Banque Libanais pour le Commerce (BLC) on Wednesday completed a $60 million capital increase through a simultaneous local and international share offering, which it said was 3.5 times oversubscribed.</p>
<p>&quot;Banque Libanais pour le Commerce (BLC) is pleased to announce the successful completion of its $60 million capital increase, of which two thirds represented a GDR offering and one third an offering of shares,&quot; BLC said in a statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;The issue also represents the first IPO since the re-opening of the Beirut Stock Exchange as well as the first bank listing on the exchange,&quot; BLC said.</p>
<p>The bank said that more than 40 percent of the GDRs were placed in the United States, 30 percent with UK institutional investors while investors in Asia and Continental Europe split the rest equally.</p>
<p>Nomura International was global co-ordinator for the capital increase and lead-managed the GDR issue. Middle East Capital Group (MECG) was lead manager for the domestic offering and co-manager of the international offering.  </p>
<p>BLC, which operates the second largest branch network of any privately-owned bank in Lebanon, said the capital increase will cover acquistion of BLC France, its Paris subsidiary which was split from the parent bank during the 1975-90 civil war, and its four branches in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>It will also cover the consolidation of the group's regional banking operations.</p>
