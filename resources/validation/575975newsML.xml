<p>Singapore naphtha firmed slightly on Monday reversing a recent near month long downward trend, traders said.</p>
<p>Late Monday, a light naphtha cargo was heard traded at 45 cents per barrel for mid June loading free-on-board Singapore discounting talks that premiums had fallen to flat, traders said.</p>
<p>At the same time a June 1-3 cargo was offered on a fixed price basis at $22.50 per barrel fob Singapore but there were no takers to close the deal</p>
<p>Despite the fresh offers, traders said the market is on the verge of recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the market is recovering though the prompt market may be bearish,&quot; said a Japanese trader.</p>
<p>Traders said the prompt naphtha market continued to be weak with ample supplies still seeking outlets. But they said the forward market in July and August market will see less suplies as the arbitrage window from the West is closed.</p>
<p>&quot;This would coincide with stronger demand from Japan and South Korea and would boost prices,&quot; said a South Korean trader.</p>
<p>Rumours were rampant that India's tender to sell May 17-19 low aromatic and high aromatic naphtha cargo were met with low bids and India had asked traders to re-submit their bids, traders in Singapore said.</p>
<p>The tender is scheduled to close May 14 and will be valid for one day.</p>
<p>Talks between Saudi Aramco and its 13 potential term buyers begins today and would last through Thursday. Hyundai Petrochemical and India's Reliance were heard to have started talks with Saudi officials earlier in the day. No details were available at press time.</p>
<p>In the naphtha swaps market, both June and July were up by 10 cents at $21.10/$21.30 and $21.30/$21.50 respectively.</p>
<p>Mogas prices held steady. Late Monday a 97 octane cargo was offered at $25.20 for May 27-31 loadinag by a Dutch major but there were no takers.</p>
<p>Taiwan is expected to issue a tender to buy 95-octane unleaded reformate for late June or early July loading on Tuesday, traders said.</p>
