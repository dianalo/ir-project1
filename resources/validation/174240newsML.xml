<p>The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell in the latest week, the government said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Labour Department said 331,000 people filed first-time claims for unemployment insurance in the week ended Nov. 2, compared with 342,000 claims in the previous week.</p>
<p>The new data brought the average weekly rate of new claims in the past four weeks to 333,500, up from 331,250 in the prior week. Economists consider the average to be a more reliable indicator of employment trends.</p>
<p>Overall benefit rolls rose to nearly 2.49 million in the week ended Oct. 26, the latest period for which those data were available. That was up from 2.44 million in the previous week, the department said.</p>
<p>The department said 12 states reported increases in initial claims exceeding 1,000 on an unadjusted basis in the week ended Oct. 26, the latest period for which those data were available.</p>
<p>Among states with the largest increases were Michigan with 8,049, Ohio with 6,993, California with 3,829, Pennsylvania with 2,751, Illinois with 2,407 and New York with 2,026.</p>
<p>Michigan reported automobile industry layoffs associated with the General Motors strike in Canada. Ohio reported layoffs in various industries. California cited layoffs in the food and agricultural industries.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania cited layoffs in the food, rubber, plastics and fabricated metals industries, and in manufacturing.</p>
<p>Illinois had layoffs in the trade and service industries and in manufacturing, while New York linked the increase to layoffs in the transportation equipment industry.</p>
<p>Mississippi had a 1,012 drop in initial claims exceeding 1,000 in the Oct. 26 week while Puerto Rico had 1,566 fewer filings, the department said.</p>
