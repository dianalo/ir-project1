<p>Belgian shares, in need of a breather after their further rise into record territory, failed to join neighbouring markets in a turnaround on Friday afternoon as Wall Street moved higher.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's getting a bit tired,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;The stocks losing are the big gainers of the past few days.&quot;</p>
<p>But analysts added that there was plenty of cash still waiting to be invested and with interest rates at historically low levels there was little alternative to stocks.</p>
<p>The Bel-20 index  .BFX finished 7.72 points or 0.35 percent lower at 2,185.81 after earlier dropping to 2,161.38.  </p>
<p>The index hit the day's low just after U.S. February payrolls data.</p>
<p>Payrolls were higher than expected but accompanied by a downward revision in January and December figures, and the data showed little upward pressure on wages. Wall Street took a positive view, and had risen 0.8 percent by the time the Belgian market had closed.</p>
<p>Of the Bel-20 index components, six ended higher, 11 fell and three were unchnaged. BBL bank, which had risen ahead of results last Wednesday, closed 1.6 percent lower on profit taking at 8,090 francs with 11,718 shares traded.  </p>
<p>Insurer Fortis AG shed 3.1 percent to 6,250 francs after rising 2.7 percent on Thursday. Dealers said the stock had been overvalued in recent weeks and was returning to more acceptable levels.</p>
<p>They also noted arbitrage between Fortis shares and the 1,628,556 Fortis scrips which were put up for sale on the Brussels bourse on Friday.</p>
<p>The bourse said the scrips were sold at 91 francs each. Because 12 scrips give the right to buy one new Fortis share at 5,040 francs, this meant the new Fortis share could be bought for 6,132 francs.</p>
