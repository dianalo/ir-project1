<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Friday were seen mostly steady, instances $0.50 lower, amid ideas that pork prices were poised to recover from recent declines, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>Top prices for interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hogs delivered to plants could range $48.00 to $49.50 per cwt and Illinois top prices could range $49.00 to $50.00.</p>
<p>Indiana/Ohio top prices at plants were seen ranging from $49.50 to $50.00.</p>
<p>The prospect for stronger pork prices could boost packer operating margins and spur higher cash hog bids, they said.  </p>
<p>Fresh hams at midday were quoted by USDA at mixed prices with lean trimmings selling $1.00-$3.00 per cwt higher. Loin prices were not established. There were 33.5 loads of pork cuts and 9.0 loads of trimmed, processed pork sold, USDA said. Pork cut-out values Wednesday were down $3.25 from a week ago.</p>
<p>Hog prices could be supported by projections for a slowdown in hog runs as producers may hold back some animals in opposition to this week's lower prices, some dealers said.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa/southern Minnesota top hog prices at the plant Thursday were $50.00, down $3.50 from a week ago, USDA statistics showed.</p>
