<p>The security situation in Colombia is likely to worsen, especially ahead of next year's elections, raising further risks for oil producers in the area, according to a senior British Petroleum Co executive.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they won't make permanent progress there until the guerillas are brought into talks,&quot; said Rodney Chase, head of BP's international upstream division, in a briefing for journalists. &quot;It's been a tough six months...and I thing it will be a very tricky year, right through to the elections,&quot; which begin next May.</p>
<p>BP, Colombia's dominant foreign oil company and operator of the giant Cusiana-Cupiagua development, is ramping up production from 215,000 barrels per day (bpd) currently to around 500,000 bpd by early next year.</p>
<p>To handle the extra production BP and its partners built the OCENSA pipeline, completed last month and running 800 kilometers from the Cusiana-Cupiagua fields in the country's eastern plains to the port of Covenas, making it the longest in the country.</p>
<p>With rebels increasing both the number and effectiveness of their attacks on the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, which ships oil from the Occidental Corp operated Cano Limon field in the north, there are fears that they may turn their attention on OCENSA as its importance grows.</p>
<p>Chase said that recent attacks on the Cano Limon pipeline, which had caused severe disruption and led to lost production and exports, was a worrying sign.</p>
<p>&quot;The sad and disturbing feature of recent bombings is that the attacks have become much more ferocious,&quot; Chase said. Whereas in the past the rebels had sought to cause just enough damage to the pipeline to slow the throughput, recent attacks have been aimed at splitting it apart, regardless of any environmental damage. Also, the rebels have shown more ruthlessness in attacking and killing those trying to repair bomb damage.</p>
<p>&quot;Will they now start to target OCENSA more? We have absolutely no way of knowing,&quot; Chase said.</p>
<p>But BP has contingency plans to deal with disruptions and hopes OCENSA, being less isolated, will be less vulnerable than Can Limon.</p>
<p>Chase also said that BP's stalled talks with the Colombian government about developing its large natural gas finds in the Piedmonte foothills were not likely to get going again until after elections.</p>
<p>So far, BP has spent between $240 million and $300 million in exploratory drilling alone in the Piedmonte gas area and those costs would rise substantially in the development stage, making it unlikely that another oil company would step in, Chase said.</p>
