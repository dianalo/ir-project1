<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday blasted the United Nations over a General Assembly vote that urged member states to actively discourage the building of Jewish settlements in occupied areas.</p>
<p>He dismissed the settlements issue as a &quot;red herring&quot; and called on the Palestinians to negotiate it in peace talks with Israel in place of stirring up world condemnation in the United Nations.</p>
<p>&quot;There's so much happening in the world. There's fighting. There are wars. There is genocide. And this is what the U.N. has to do?&quot; Netanyahu said on the U.S. Cable News Network (CNN).</p>
<p>&quot;To convene a whole General Assembly special session because we are building some housing for young couples, incidentally for Arabs and Jews alike?&quot;</p>
<p>Tuesday's General Assembly resolution, sponsored by 15 Arab and Moslem nations, condemned Israeli settlement activity and, in a move toward sanctions, demanded Israel provide information about goods produced in the settlements.</p>
<p>The vote was 131-3 with 14 abstentions. Israel, Micronesia and the United States voted against.</p>
<p>An aide to Netanyahu, David Bar-Illan, called the decision &quot;shameful&quot; and &quot;morally bankrupt&quot;.</p>
<p>The resolution follows a report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemning Israel for not abandoning settlement construction at a site in Arab East Jerusalem called Har Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic.</p>
<p>The Assembly demanded at an emergency special session in April that Israel halt work at the Jerusalem site, where bulldozers are preparing the infrastructure for 6,500 homes.</p>
<p>The start of construction last March plunged Israel-PLO peacemaking into crisis and triggered waves of Palestinian unrest in the West Bank and Gaza, captured in the 1967 Middle East War.</p>
<p>Israel, which captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it in a move the international community has not recognised, says all of Jerusalem is its united capital.</p>
<p>Arabs view the Jerusalem construction and other settlement activity as an attempt to pre-empt future peace talks on the West Bank, wanted by Palestinians as part of a future state with its capital in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Netanyahu scoffed at charges that Israel was pre-empting talks.</p>
<p>&quot;The total area of the settlements as a proportion of the built-up areas of the West Bank is about one percent...the whole idea that we're pre-empting the other 99 percent is ridiculous,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a non-issue. A red herring.&quot;</p>
<p>The new resolution recommends that the parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which bars settlements in occupied territory, convene a conference on measures to enforce the convention and asks the secretary-general to provide a report in three months.</p>
<p>The resolution recommends that U.N. members &quot;actively discourage activities which directly contribute to any construction or development of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem.&quot;</p>
