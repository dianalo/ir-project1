<p>Prices of Russian MinFin bonds rose further on Wednesday ahead of the announcement of Russia's country debt rating for its planned Eurobond issue, but fell back from earlier highs, dealers said.</p>
<p>Finance minister Alexander Livshits said on Tuesday that the rating should be known in the 10 days. Dealers said some Western operators were expecting the announcement in the next two days.</p>
<p>		 tranche  Oct 2		   Oct 1</p>
<p> 1999 maturity (3)    78.45-78.75	   78.25-78.50</p>
<p> 2003 maturity (4)    53.80-54.10	   53.15-53.40</p>
<p> 2008 maturity (5)    35.80-36.10	   35.25-35.50</p>
<p> 2006 maturity (6)    42.00-42.30	   41.00-41.25</p>
<p> 2011 maturity (7)    31.00-31.30	   29.90-30.15</p>
<p>&quot;Buying interest is very active on rating expectations. Foreign operators are buying, while Russian banks are following the trend which is set from abroad,&quot; an ICFI Moscow Partners Bank dealer said.</p>
<p>But dealers said prices had eased recently on profit-taking. The most actively traded third, fourth and fifth tranches met resistance at 79.00-79.30, 54.50-54.80 and 36.50-36.80 respectively, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors have already bought what they wanted and left the market. Prices are going down on a technical correction and profit-taking,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers forecast more price fluctuations ahead of the rating announcement and in the following weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices could ease after the rating is known as they have reached too high levels,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>But the ICFI Moscow Partners Bank dealer said prices could still rise a few big figures, while short retrenchments were possible on corrections and news about President Boris Yeltsin's health.</p>
