<headline>Argentine gov't, unions near deal on reforms - paper.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1996-12-13</dateline>

<p>The Argentine government and the labor federation CGT have resumed key talks on proposed labor reforms and health-care deregulation and hope to strike a deal this month, the daily Clarin said Friday.</p>
<p>Quoting congressional sources, the paper said President Carlos Menem was following progress closely and officials hoped consensus could be reached as early as next Tuesday.</p>
<p>The government believes an accord with the unions, which adamantly oppose the labor reform plans and have staged strikes this year, will ease the bill's passage through a reluctant Congress.  </p>
<p>Clarin quoted government sources as saying Menem, although buoyed by the talks, has told his aides that if necessary he will still pass the labor reforms by presidential decree.</p>
<p>Contact between unions and the government had broken down and the CGT held a 24-hour general strike in August and a 36-hour strike in September.</p>
<p>Menem hopes the package of laws, which would end collective bargaining and replace compensation payments for dismissal with unemployment insurance, will cut Argentina's 17.1-percent joblessness rate.</p>
<p>The CGT also opposes government plans to deregulate the unions-run health care system from January 1997 to allow the free choice of health system and the participation of private companies from 1998.</p>
