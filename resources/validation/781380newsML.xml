<p>The Czech PX50 index rose strongly on Wednesday, closing 11.6 points, 2.2 percent, higher at 530.9 boosted by powerful gains to SPT Telecom and Komercni Banka.</p>
<p>Komercni, the largest Czech commercial bank, surged 145 crowns, 8.1 percent, to 1,932 on increasingly positive foreign sentiment about its first half results.</p>
<p>Last week, Komercni posted sharpy lower first half net profits. Many local dealers and analysts received the results with alarm but Dan Gladis of Atlantik Financial Markets said foreign investors were beginning to take a more optimistic view.</p>
<p>&quot;People look at the figures and realise that the earnings that Komercni reported was actually not bad...The main reason why the earnings were down was due to huge unrealised loss on their securities holdings,&quot; Gladis said.</p>
<p>&quot;But by the end of this year most of this money will be back because bonds are going up and equities are going up as well,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dealers said that SPT, which gained 183 crowns, 4.5 percent, to 4,223, was also rising on its first half results but cautioned that a round of profit taking may be imminent.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a little overpriced...I would hold it or I would sell,&quot; said Vaclav Verner of Zivnostenska Banka.</p>
<p>SPT was one of the few Czech major issues to post first half earnings which were immediatly welcomed by domestic and foreign analysts.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, power utility CEZ managed a two crown gain to 921 while Ceska SporitelnA fell three crowns to 255.</p>
<p>In the broader market, Prazske Pivovary, 55 percent owned by Britain's Bass plc lost two crowns to 226.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, the brewer, whose main brand is Staropramen, posted heavier first half losses although it noted that the 1997 figures were consolidated to include results from two regional breweries, Vratislavice and Ostravar, which became part of Prazske Pivovary on Febraury 1.</p>
<p>Overall, activity was much higher with turnover rising to 1.8 billion crowns.</p>
