<p>Spreads on Brazilian Eurobonds are poised for further tightening early in 1997, which could make them too pricey for yield-hungry investors, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The new issues coming out this year are getting expensive. My concern is spreads will get tighter and tighter, which is not good for the market because it will send investors looking for other alternatives,&quot; said a head trader at a leading Brazilian investment bank.</p>
<p>Improving fundamentals in Brazil and stiff competition among banks to lead manage a record number of new deals helped drive down launch prices in 1996 and will continue to do so early this year, traders said.</p>
<p>Many Brazilian companies like OPP Petroquimica, a unit of Odebrecht, saw launch prices fall sharply last year. OPP's $125 million eight-year bond  NZ4C priced at 637 basis points over U.S. Treasuries in February and in October, its $100 million eight-year  ZPQ0 priced at just 460 basis points over Treasuries.</p>
<p>But with some $1.0 billion in new issues pricing in the last few weeks of 1996 and another $1.5 billion in the pipeline, many traders say too much Brazilian paper is hitting the market.</p>
<p>&quot;There is just no placement for all this paper,&quot; said a trader at a large international bank in Brazil.</p>
<p>The trader noted that many Brazilian issues have traded down after their launches, especially the three- to five-year issues. And many expected the trend to continue as the market remains well supplied with Brazilian paper.</p>
<p>Brazil leads Latin America with 234 debt issues in the Eurobond market, compared with 151 for both Mexico and Argentina. The nation issued an estimated $17 billion in Eurobonds and commercial paper in 1996, surpassing 1995's record of $11.5 billion.</p>
<p>An anticipated wave of privatizations in 1997 is expected to push debt issuance to new heights as Brazilian firms tap external markets to raise money. Local and foreign investors are gearing up to bid for more than $15 billion in federal and state-owned assets bound for the auction block.</p>
<p>And although interest rates in Brazil fell substantially last year, it is still far cheaper for top-name Brazilian banks and corporations to borrow abroad than at home.</p>
<p>For example, Brazilian bank Bradesco, Latin America's largest retail bank, raised some $1.95 billion last year and plans to borrow 20 percent more than that in 1997.</p>
<p>Despite the well supplied market, launch prices have remained relatively expensive because of strong competition among banks to lead manage the new deals, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The banks are getting aggressive to get mandates, which is keeping prices down,&quot; said one trader.</p>
