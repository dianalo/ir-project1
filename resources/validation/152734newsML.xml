<p>Serb winger Ljubimko Drulovic was Porto's man of the match, scoring once and setting up two goals as they beat Norway's Rosenborg 3-0 on Wednesday to reach the last eight of the European Cup.</p>
<p>The Portuguese champions, who moved on to 12 points at the top of group D of the Champions' League, opened the scoring in the 31st minute when Drulovic slipped a pass through the legs of Rosenborg defender Otto Bragstad for Slovenian midfielder Zlatko Zahovic to hit home.</p>
<p>In the 40th minute Drulovic extended Porto's lead with a free kick from just outside the area. His team mates ducked to allow his left-foot shot to fly over their heads into the right-hand corner of the net.</p>
<p>Porto went 3-0 up on the hour when Drulovic set up Brazilian striker Artur Oliveira, who charged past two defenders to score.</p>
<p>Oliveira, Porto's top scorer in the European games with four goals, had been in doubt until the very last minute because of a minor injury.</p>
<p>Rosenborg set up several good scoring opportunities in the second half.</p>
<p>Right after the break Roar Strand, alone in front of Porto's goal, forced keeper Henrique Hilario to make a spectacular sideways dive.</p>
<p>Bent Skammelsrud, the Norwegian side's most dangerous player, hit the bar in the 72nd minute.</p>
<p>Norwegian coach Nils Eggen said his team had lost energy too early on: &quot;We were imprecise. We didn't play well enough and Porto knew how to take advantage.&quot;</p>
<p>Porto coach Antonio Oliveira said his team had deserved their victory: &quot;Now we're going to give it all we've got to make the final,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Porto last won the European Cup in 1987.</p>
<p>Porto's victory was slightly marred by defender Paulinho Santos's yellow card in the 67th minute which will leave him out of his team's return match against AC Milan. Porto beat the Italian side 3-2 last month.</p>
<p>Rosenborg's Bragstad and Bjorn Kvarme also received yellow cards in the 40th and 64th minutes respectively.</p>
