<p>Indian Petroleum Minister Janeshwar Mishra said on Monday the ruling United Front coalition may have to postpone a crucial meeting on oil prices this week because he could not attend.</p>
<p>The meeting, set for July 4, is widely expected to result in a decision to raise some petroleum prices in order to plug the government's mounting oil subsidy bill.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying to postpone the date because I myself will not be present here on the fourth,&quot; Mishra told Reuters. He was speaking after inaugurating a new government office in the capital.</p>
<p>Asked when the 15-party coalition would make its decision, Mishra said: &quot;I think in the month of July anyhow.&quot;</p>
<p>The meeting has already been postponed twice from an original June 27 date amid divisions within the United Front over how to control the rising cost of oil imports.</p>
<p>The government owes state oil companies an estimated 155 billion rupees ($4.3 billion) and the companies have complained they cannot keep importing crude unless domestic prices are raised.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram favour raising the prices of some petroleum products, but they are strongly opposed by left-wing parties.</p>
<p>The Communist Party of India (Marxist) wants customs and excise duties on oil eliminated and has submitted an alternative plan to avoid higher petroleum prices which it says would hurt the poor.</p>
<p>The plan suggests the government returns to state-run oil firms funds the firms contributed to the so-called &quot;oil pool&quot; account.</p>
<p>High prices on some petroleum products, such as petrol, had yielded funds that were put into the account in order to offset the cost of subsidies on other products such as diesel and kerosene.</p>
<p>The government regularly dipped into the account when it was in surplus, but now it owes the companies large sums of money because it is in deficit.</p>
<p>Because the government would have to absorb the payment to the oil companies, the communists' plan has met stiff opposition from alliance leaders, including Chidambaram, who are keen to reduce the fiscal deficit.</p>
<p>Any increase in petroleum product prices would be the second by the United Front in its one year in power.</p>
<p>Last July the government raised the price of gasoline by 25 percent and the prices of high-speed diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking, paraffin wax and fuel oil by 30 percent.</p>
<p>It was forced to scale back the rise in diesel prices to 15 percent after nationwide protests supported by left-wing parties. ($1 = 35.8 rupees)</p>
