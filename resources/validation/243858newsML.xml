<p>British truckdriver Alan Kendall sips a beer and stares at the forest ahead without hope. For the past eight days he has been stranded in the middle of Greece with a cargo of meat and it is in danger of spoiling.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time in 35 years that I won't be home for Christmas,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;I was held up in France by a truckers' strike and now here by the farmers. I want a hot shower and a good meal but above all I want to move on.&quot;</p>
<p>Kendall's truck, with 20 tonnes of frozen meat destined for Azerbaijan, is among hundreds of trucks trapped in this central Greek forest area by a farmers' barricade.</p>
<p>The drivers come from Britain, Turkey, Bulgaria, Germany, Iran, Italy, Denmark. They are preparing dinner, mostly chicken and rice, on camp-stoves but a sudden downpour sends them running back to their cabs.</p>
<p>&quot;We are people not animals,&quot; says Kendall, who was caught in France by last month's truckers' strike there.</p>
<p>This time, he says, he hasn't shaved in four days. &quot;We have been using the forest for a toilet. The farmers brought us some pork chops and chips for the first time after seven days.</p>
<p>&quot;But the gesture didn't make colleagues from Iran and Turkey happy because they are Moslems and don't eat pork. The farmers told them, that's it. Take it or leave it.&quot;</p>
<p>When the television news comes on, the drivers gather in front of a battery-powered set hoping for an announcement that the Greek farmers' nationwide blockades, pressing economic demands and now in the 12th day, have been dismantled.</p>
<p>&quot;Please tell me what this guy is saying,&quot; asks Bulgarian driver Pimcho Atanasov pointing at farmers' representative Yannis Pattakis, the most frequent face on television since the blockades began.</p>
<p>&quot;I am out of diesel, trying to keep warm and keeping my cargo of margarine from going bad. Now it's spoiled,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't care anymore... I just want to go back home to Sofia.&quot;</p>
<p>He pulls 3,000 drachmas ($15) out of his pocket. &quot;This is all I have left. I don't know what's going to happen if I stay here another day.&quot;</p>
<p>But Pattakis has no good news. &quot;We will continue our struggle until the government gives in to our just demands. We understand the problems we have caused but the government holds the key to freeing up the roads.&quot;</p>
<p>A thick fog begins to cover the area. The drivers go silent and trudge back to their trucks for another cold night with only cheap brandy to keep them warm.</p>
<p>The mood at the barricades is different. In Tempi, farmers roast a lamb on a spit, sitting on plastic chairs around a fire which gleams through the fog.</p>
<p>They play cards under a makeshift tent. A band plays bouzouki songs.</p>
<p>They drink shots of ouzo and make jokes about the government as the smell of smoked meat mixes with burning rubber from tyres in the fire.</p>
<p>The farmers have set up 90 barricades on the national road network -- about 10,000 tractors are blocking traffic.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't have to go back into the fields until March. If the government doesn't give us cheaper fuel and better prices it had better have a lot of patience,&quot; cotton grower Aris Manolopoulos says.</p>
