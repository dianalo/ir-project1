<p>Thai consumer prices are set to jump following the baht's flotation and, unless the government intervenes, import bills for oil products and animal feed ingredients could swell, industry sources and analysts said.</p>
<p>The baht sank to 28.00/29.00 per dollar in the offshore market on Wednesday from 24.80/25.10 at the close on Tuesday after the surprise move was announced.  </p>
<p>Exports of the country's primary commodities such as rice, rubber and sugar were seen having a field day after the de facto devaluation, but the benefits were expected to be outweighed, at least near-term, by higher imports bills.</p>
<p>Although Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh pledged that the government would do its best to stabilise prices of public utilities such as water and electricity and other necessities for six months, what the state could do in a free market environment for basic commodities remained a big question.  </p>
<p>Thailand's oil imports during the first four months of 1997 cost 51 billion baht ($1.82 billion), a 4.6 percent rise from the same period last year as the country's refining capacity has expanded. With the falling baht, the bill was seen rising.</p>
<p>Non-oil imports topped 550 billion baht for the same period, falling 5.9 percent from the corresponding period in 1996.</p>
<p>Food prices could also soon rise if the government does not intervene, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Thailand's expanding animal and poultry industry has raised demand for feed ingredient imports such as soybeans, soymeal and corn and the country has spent billions of baht importing millions of tonnes of such products.</p>
<p>Any higher cost to importers of these commodities was seen being passed on to consumers.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as the government can control the prices to pacify the public, things will be okay,&quot; said an economist with a European investment bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Once people get panicked by rising inflation and find incentives to hold dollars, a real crisis will occur,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Thailand has not faced problems with price stability so far as its most severe economic downturn in over a decade has slowed spending generally. The latest June consumer prices index rose 4.4 percent year-on-year against 4.3 percent in May and the six- month moving average has also been at 4.4 percent.</p>
<p>Supavudh Saicheau, vice president of Phatra Thanakit Plc, forecast more inflationary pressure but downplayed its effect.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government manages the monetary policy well after the float there's no need to worry. The inflation will be high, so will the interest rate and the return. That will make it attractive to hold on to baht,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>However, the silver lining for commodities exports will be the boost they will get as a result of the cheaper baht.</p>
<p>Vorapong Pitchpongsa, president of Thai Rice Exporters Association, forecast rice exports will pick up after the float.</p>
<p>&quot;The float will make Thai exports cheaper in foreign markets. Thai rice premiums over competitors' prices such as Vietnam will narrow and give it a better chance to compete.&quot;</p>
<p>Thailand's natural rubber producing sector, the largest in the world, will also benefit from the baht float although the move was expected to initially put further pressure on an already very bearish market.  </p>
<p>Sanit Samosorn, a senior agriculture ministry in charge of rubber, told Reuters a floating currency will bring lower rubber prices and this will partly boost exports.</p>
<p>&quot;We see it as a good move. But other exporting countries might find the move depressing initially as it will pressure their prices as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the price is only one side of the coin. It will help to a certain extent. The market is looking forward to a real improvement in demand,&quot; he said.</p>
