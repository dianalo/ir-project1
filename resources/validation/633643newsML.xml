<p>The Peruvian economy grew 13.4 percent year-on-year in April, compared with a 1.8 percent year-on-year growth in the same month last year, the government said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The government daily El Peruano reported year-on-year Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the first four months of the year was 7.3 percent, compared with a 0.7 growth in the January to April period 1996.  </p>
<p>The country's April year-on-year growth was led by the fishing sector at 37.4 percent, followed by construction with 23.7 percent, the newspaper said, using figures from the National Institute for Statistics and Information (INEI).</p>
<p>El Peruano did not give comparative figures by sector for April 1996.</p>
<p>The worst performing sector in April was agriculture, which grew year-on-year 4.6 percent.  </p>
<p>Among other sectors in April, manufacturing grew 20.4 percent, commerce 16.3 percent, while the INEI's miscellaneous category rose 9.2 percent. Electricity and water rose 8.5 percent and the mining sector grew 6.1 percent.</p>
<p>The government estimates Peru is headed for overall year- on-year GDP growth of four to five percent in 1997. Peru's GDP rose 2.8 percent in 1996 versus 7.0 percent the previous year.</p>
<p>GDP figures provided by the INEI often differ slightly from those of the central bank, which are published later, because the bank collects additional information from the country's customs agency SUNAD, according to bank officials.</p>
