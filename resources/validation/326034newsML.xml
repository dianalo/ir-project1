<title>USA: Senate support of chemical treaty urged.</title>

<p>Republican Senator Richard Lugar urged the U.S. Senate on Tuesday to support a treaty banning chemical weapons even though Senate ratification of the treaty is at an impasse.</p>
<p>Ignoring the impasse, Lugar introduced a non-binding sense of the Senate resolution that would declare ratification of the treaty to be crucial to U.S. and international efforts to control and prevent the use of chemical weapons.</p>
<p>An aide said Lugar, an Indiana Republican and former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, hoped by raising the issue to build Senate support for the treaty that might help break the impasse.</p>
<p>Sen. Jesse Helm, a North Carolina Republican and present chairman of the committee, has blocked Senate action to ratify the treaty, saying there is no way to verify that countries that sign the treaty carry out its requirement that they destroy their chemical weapons.</p>
<p>Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott agreed last year to put ratification to a vote but President Bill Clinton's administration won cancellation of the vote because ratification was likely to lose.</p>
<p>All legislation must start over again in the new Congress that convened this month and Helms' committee has said again it has no plan to clear the treaty for Senate ratification.</p>
<p>Administration officials are trying again to win a Senate vote and were heartened by a letter Lott wrote Clinton raising the possibility of a Senate vote on the chemical weapons treaty if Clinton sends the Senate other arms agreements that Republican senators want to ratify.</p>
