<p>United Airlines Chairman Gerald Greenwald said Wednesday that United's participation in the Star Alliance airline partnership did not change its opposition to the proposed pact between American Airlines and British Airways Plc.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a misconception about what we're doing compared to what American is proposing to do. There's only similarity and it's the word 'alliance.' Beyond that, we part company,&quot; Greenwald said.  </p>
<p>The Star Alliance -- which includes UAL Corp's United, Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Air Canada, Scandinavian Airlines System and Thai Airways International Ltd -- was formally announced earlier today.</p>
<p>Although no merger will take place among the airlines, the carriers will have common branding in marketing and advertising and will coordinate routes and offer code-sharing, when possible.</p>
<p>The alliance is a bid to cut costs and offer integrated, seamless travel for passengers and cargo.  </p>
<p>Robert Crandall, chairman of AMR Corp, the corporate parent of American Airlines, said the Star Alliance was a &quot;good news/bad news&quot; story.</p>
<p>&quot;The good news is that the unveiling of the Star Alliance, which is far larger than the proposed American/BA alliance, will presumably end United Airlines's hypocritical opposition to our planned alliance,&quot; said Crandall, who is also chairman and chief executive of American Airlines.  </p>
<p>The &quot;bad news&quot; is that the Star Alliance highlights the regulatory delay on both sides of the Atlantic that &quot;have prevented American and British Airways from moving forward with an alliance we need in order to restore competitive balance in the transatlantic airline market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We seek no special favor, only the right to compete with existing alliances and to offer our customers a wider choice,&quot; Crandall said.  </p>
<p>In a conference call with U.S. reporters, United's Greenwald said the Star Alliance did not alter United's opposition to the American-BA pact, proposed by the carriers last year but mired in regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>United and other critics contend that the proposed BA-American alliance would monopolize travel between the U.K. and the U.S.</p>
<p>Greenwald said the Star Alliance would not prevent rival carriers from competing.</p>
<p>&quot;Any U.S. carrier is free to fly to anywhere in Germany. Any German airline if free to fly to anywhere in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;In contrast, the U.K. is a very restricted, protected market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;American and BA are proposing to combine their resources without any tangible plan for a full opening of that (UK) market so other airlines can compete freely ... If they're going to have that alliance, we want to be free to compete,&quot; Greenwald said.</p>
