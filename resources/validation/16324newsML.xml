<p>Moldovan parliamentarians opposed to President Mircea Snegur spurned awards he offered to mark Tuesday's fifth anniversary of independence from the Soviet Union in protest at Snegur's support of ties with Romania.</p>
<p>The president offered the Civic Merit medal to all 272 members of the local Soviet-era parliament who adopted the country's declaration of independence on August 27, 1991.</p>
<p>But 37 signatories, now members of the majority Agrarian Democratic Party, did not turn up at a solemn ceremony arranged to present the awards.</p>
<p>The Agrarians' press service called Snegur's award &quot;populist&quot;, drawing an angry response from the president.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want to be decorated together with those, who later launched a fierce fight against Moldova's independence and headed towards unification with Romania,&quot; one deputy said.</p>
<p>Most of Moldova comprises the former Romanian province of Bessarabia, annexed by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin under a secret pact with Nazi Germany in 1940.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union in late 1991, many Moldovan politicians formed the Unification Council which proclaimed merger with Romania as its main goal.</p>
<p>Pro-independence Agrarians and their candidate, Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli, will be the main challenge to Snegur seeking re-election in Moldova's presidential elections due on November 17.</p>
<p>Several pro-Romanian parties have said they would back Snegur in the elections, but the president have repeatedly stressed he remains devoted to the country's independence.</p>
