<title>ITALY: SOCCER-FORMER PARMA BOSS SCALA HINTS AT MOVE ABROAD.</title>
<headline>SOCCER-FORMER PARMA BOSS SCALA HINTS AT MOVE ABROAD.</headline>
<dateline>TRENTO, Italy 1996-12-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Former Parma coach Nevio Scala may be leaving Italy shortly.</p>
<p>&quot;I could soon be coaching a foreign team,&quot; he said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Scala, who guided Parma to the UEFA Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup, did not mention any destination. But he said it &quot;will not be Barcelona or Borussia Moenchengladbach&quot;.</p>
<p>The coach, who has been spending time on his farm near Vicenza since he left Parma at the end of last season, also appeared to have ruled himself out of the race to take over the job of Italy coach left vacant by Arrigo Sacchi.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the decision's made and the choice of Cesare Maldini is certainly adequate,&quot; said Scala, one of three main candidates for the job with Lazio's Dino Zoff.</p>
<p>Italian newspapers have reported that under-21 coach Maldini, father of Italian international defender Paolo Maldini, has the post sewn up. The announcement is expected after the Italian federation elects a new chairman on Saturday.</p>
