<p>Czech broadcasters and legislators are battling over whether non-prescription medicine can be advertised on television in a court case that highlights a fierce debate over how advertising should be regulated.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a complicated issue. It's a jungle,&quot; Vladimir Zelezny, director general of TV NOVA, a private Czech television network, told an advertising conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Zelezny, whose network is one of two which has sought a court ruling on whether over-the-counter drugs can be advertised on television, said the confusion over the law is symptomatic of the regulatory problems plaguing the Czech advertising industry.</p>
<p>Drug advertising is regulated by the Czech Ministry  of Health Care in a country that is trying to adopt Western models of self-regulation for advertising while still maintaining a role for the law in certain cases.</p>
<p>Like other current advertising regulation in the Czech Republic, the ban on drug advertising was introduced after the fall of communism in 1989 heralded a new era in free market economics. But without a tradition of capitalism and advertising, legislators and advertisers have struggled to find the right blend of freedom and oversight.</p>
<p>The court case on advertising over-the counter drugs has been pending for seven months, following a ruling by the Ministry of Health Care that the current legislation prohibits advertising drugs on television.</p>
<p>But deputy health minister Alex Dvoulety and Jan Kasal, vice president of the Czech House of Representatives, admitted the law is ambiguous.</p>
<p>&quot;My personal view is OTC advertisement is is legal,&quot; Dvoulety said. &quot;The ministry thinks otherwise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have to agree ... that the law is not very clear,&quot; said Kasal. But he cautioned that one has to understand the climate in which the law was introduced.</p>
<p>Zelezny argued that much of the problem lies with legislators learning to understand the workings of a free press -- one that should not be subject to the kind of censorship that the communist regime imposed on what it termed the information media..</p>
<p>&quot;There are problems with the Ministry of Health Care, because the Ministry of Health Care has no experience with TV,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope in the future we'll be able to learn from the European countries,&quot; he added.</p>
