<p>The Bank of Italy is likely to take half a percentage point off key interest rates when it next eases monetary policy, but a rate reduction will not come until early December, economists said in a survey.</p>
<p>The Reuter poll of 13 economists showed only one expected the central bank to ease before the month end, directly in the wake of the lira's return to Europe's exchange rate mechanism.</p>
<p>Eight analysts polled on Monday, the day after European finance ministers readmitted the lira to the currency grid, said they expected a rate cut within the first half of next month, once final inflation data for November had been published.</p>
<p>Analysts have revised their expectations slightly from last week, shortly before the lira's ERM return, when four of them thought a rate cut was possible before the month's end.</p>
<p>Preliminary figures last week showed consumer prices running at 2.6 percent year-on-year compared with 3.0 percent in October and final data are due on December 5.</p>
<p>Ten analysts in Monday's survey saw the Bank of Italy lopping 50 basis points off the discount rate when it makes its next move, a cut which would take the rate down to 7.0 percent.</p>
<p>Italy last lowered its discount rate 75 basis points to 7.5 percent and its fixed term advances or Lombard rate to 9.0 percent on October 23.</p>
<p>Following are the results of the survey:</p>
<p>1 - Will there be further cuts in Italian interest rates?</p>
<p>	  Yes						    13</p>
<p>	  No							0</p>
<p>2 - When?</p>
<p>	  By the end of November			    1</p>
<p>	  Within the first half of December	     8</p>
<p>	  By the year end				     3</p>
<p>	  In first quarter of 1997			  1</p>
<p>3 - By how much?</p>
<p>	  50 basis points				    10</p>
<p>	  50-75 basis points				  2</p>
<p>	  75 basis points				     1</p>
<p>The following banks participated: Banca di Roma, Banco di Sardegna, Chase Manhattan, BCI, HSBC, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Nomura, Paribas Capital Markets, San Paolo Bank, Salomon Brothers, UBS.</p>
