<p>Polish construction firm Mostostal Zabrze SA plans to invest about 50 million Polish zloty ($17.8 million) in the next two years, a company official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to be competitive we must modernise....(and) next year will will invest about 30 million zlotys and in 1998 about 20 million,&quot; Adam Konopka, a director at the holding's headquarters, told a news conference.</p>
<p>The investment will modernise production lines in six firms grouped under Mostostal, expand the firm's holding by another two firms and increase the share capital in its existing companies, Konopka said.</p>
<p>Mostostal Zabrze now controls 14 firms, and has at least a 70 percent stake in all but one of those companies.</p>
<p>The president of Mostostal Zabrze Leszek Pietrzak said until 2000 his firm planned to become a financial holding, meaning it would end its production activities which would, in turn, be taken up by its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>&quot;In the upcoming years we want to become a financial holding, we will manage the finances and subsidiaries will carry out the production,&quot; Pietrzak said.</p>
<p>Until 2010, Mostostal Zabrze plans to double its sales every three years because of the high pace of industrial development of southern Poland, Pietrzak said.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that until 2010 our firm will be doubling its sales every three years, because the southern region will be the focal point of large-scale investment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said several large automobile concerns, a refinery and super market chain already decided to expand in the region and that Mostostal was well equiped to take part in the investment.</p>
<p>Mostostal Zabrze group's revenue, at 190.5 million zlotys in 1995, is expected to surge to 280 million this year, 380 million in 1997 and some 500 million in 1998.</p>
<p>Mostostal's group net is expected to rise to 14 million zlotys this year and 20 million in 1997 from 6.2 million in 1995.</p>
