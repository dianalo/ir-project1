<p>The German Banking Federation (BdB) said on Monday that German growth could reach around 2.5 percent in 1997 but said it did not expect a stabilisation on the jobs market until the second half of the year.</p>
<p>BdB president Karl-Heinz Wessel said in the text of a speech to be delivered at a news conference that German domestic product had not kept pace with developments in gross national product.</p>
<p>&quot;In the light of the first glimmer of hope on infrastructure spending, we consider growth of around 2.5 percent to be achieveable for 1997, however only if the investment outlook improves,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The BdB also said that the jobs market was a major worry and that it did not expect the situation to stabilise until the second half of 1997 at the earliest, even if the economy improved.  </p>
<p>The official government forecast for GDP growth this year is 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>Wessel said that the monetary environment provided positive signals for growth, both in Germany and in Europe as a whole.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices in Germany are broadly stable. We do not expect any change in the Bundesbank's monetary policy this year. This has created an ideal environment for low capital market interest rates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;From this perspective, there are very favourable conditions for investment,&quot; he added.</p>
