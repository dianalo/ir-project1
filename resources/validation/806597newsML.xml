<p>A chunky UK public sector debt repayment in July bodes well for the government meeting this year's PSBR forecast and adds to the picture of a booming economy, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;These are fundamentally good numbers and the improvement we are seeing as the months go by confirm that the budget forecast is easily achievable,&quot; said Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Nikko Europe.</p>
<p>Data released on Monday showed a public sector debt repayment of 3.875 billion pounds ($6.2 billion), well above analysts' expectations of a 1.9 billion pound repayment.</p>
<p>In the fiscal year so far the government has had to borrow 4.367 billion stg to make up the shortfall between tax receipts and public spending.</p>
<p>This compares with 8.11 billion stg in the same period last year. In July, the government forecast a total PSBR of 10.9 billion stg for the 1997/98 fiscal year.</p>
<p>The dramatic improvement in the public finances was largely due to a flood of value-added tax (VAT) receipts in July, partly due to technical changes in collection and partly due to robust consumer spending on goods eligible for VAT.</p>
<p>New rules mean substantial inflows of VAT will take place at the beginning of each quarter.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics said VAT receipts to the tune of 5.032 billion sterling in July were the highest since records began and analysts said this showed consumer spending was still thriving.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the  bigger-than-expected surplus seems to have been driven primarily by a large increase in VAT receipts. That is a reflection of the strength of the domestic economy here,&quot; said Rob Hayward, economist at Bank America.</p>
<p>&quot;It's partly also a reflection of the fact the PSBR now is far more responsive to the economic cycle. The economy now seems to be driven by surging consumer spending.&quot;  </p>
<p>But despite the technical boost from timing to VAT payments, analysts said the underlying numbers still looked good and this buoyancy in revenue was likely to continue for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;It does seem as if the changes to VAT payments have affected the timing of VAT receipts and July has benefited at the expense of some other months,&quot; Briscoe said. &quot;But the general buoyancy of all of the tax receipts is something which cannot be ignored.&quot;</p>
<p>As well as the climb in VAT payments, other tax receipts such as corporation tax and income tax also came in strongly.</p>
<p>And while the most dramatic growth came on the revenue side, analysts pointed out that tight control over departmental spending in July was also encouraging for the prospects of the government meeting its public debt forecast.</p>
<p>&quot;There was good news on spending too, with departmental outlays up by just 0.2 percent year-on-year, suggesting that the impressive spending restraint seen in the second half of last year continues,&quot; said Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC Markets.</p>
<p>Although optimistic about the government's chances of reaching its public debt forecast for the fiscal year, economists were much more wary about the chances of public finances moving into the black in the near future.</p>
<p>Some were doubtful that the current levels of economic growth could be sustained in the long term, as well as forecasting rising pressures to increase public expenditure.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's a close call as to whether they will (move into surplus), because I think we will find there are increasing pressures on them to spend money,&quot; Briscoe said.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is currently growing at a rate which is unlikely to be sustained. I think we will get close to a balance, but I don't think we're looking at a significant, sustainable move into surplus.&quot;</p>
<p>Bank America's Hayward agreed that, depending on the economy, a move towards a zero balance was possible but a tip over into surplus less likely.</p>
