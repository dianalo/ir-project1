<p>Japanese patrol ships on Monday expelled five boats of Taiwan and Hong Kong activists trying to land on a chain of disputed East China Sea islands to defy Tokyo's claim to sovereignty, Taiwan radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;Two of the ships tried to force their way at full speed to the Diaoyu islands but were stopped by Japanese police vessels about 200 metres (yards) away,&quot; the broadcast said.</p>
<p>&quot;The atmosphere was very tense.... They are returning to Taiwan now because the Japanese force is really big,&quot; the broadcast said. Japan used 17 coast guard and police ships, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Get out of Chinese territory!&quot; Taiwan and Hong Kong activists shouted through loudspeakers, the radio reported.</p>
<p>Officials aboard the Japanese ships demanded the vessels immediately leave what they called Japanese territory.</p>
<p>&quot;We are confident that next time we will succeed,&quot; Taipei county assemblyman and protest organiser Chin Chieh-shou told the radio, pledging another attempt in late October.</p>
<p>The five vessels, carring about 20 activists from Taiwan and Hong Kong and up to 60 journalists, set sail on Sunday aiming to challenge Japan's claim of sovereignty to the uninhabited islands, which it calls the Senkakus.</p>
<p>A makeshift lighthouse built on one of the islands in July by a Japanese right-wing youth group has rekindled a festering dispute over the islands, claimed by Beijing, Taipei and Tokyo.</p>
<p>Chinese anger swelled in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and the communist mainland after Japanese patrol ships frustrated earlier Taiwanese attempts to approach the islands.</p>
<p>&quot;If we have a chance we will definitely land on the island. We'll tear down the lighthouse, burn the Japanese flag and hoist our own national flag,&quot; Chin said before the latest journey.</p>
<p>The Taiwan activists hoped to plant the flag of the island's exiled Republic of China. The Hong Kong protesters were carrying that of the mainland's People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>On Sunday, up to 10,000 drum-beating demonstrators chanted &quot;Down with Japanese militarism&quot; and &quot;Protect the Diaoyus&quot; as they marched through Taipei streets, the latest in a series of anti-Japanese protests in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.</p>
<p>An effigy of Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was tied to a car and flogged during the march, also attended by dozens of Hong Kong and Macau activists.</p>
<p>&quot;The Diaoyu islands belong to the Chinese,&quot; protester Wei Tsu-chun said. &quot;We Chinese people cannot be bullied by any country. We can't tolerate any country invading our territory.&quot;</p>
<p>Taiwan pledged on Saturday to defend the Diaoyus by force, but only as a last resort. Taiwan's foreign ministry planned to hold a second round of talks with Japan in October on rival claims to fishing waters around the islands.</p>
<p>Japan has claimed sovereign rights to the islands and refused to acknowledge that the dispute is still open for discussion with China.</p>
<p>Tokyo's claim dates to 1895, when Japan defeated China and seized Taiwan and other territories. Beijing and Taipei say Chinese claims go back centuries but both have resisted calls to expel Japan by force.</p>
<p>Taiwan and China have been bitter rivals since a civil war split them in 1949 and the Republic of China government, defeated by the communists, took refuge on Taiwan.</p>
