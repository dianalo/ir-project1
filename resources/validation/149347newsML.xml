<p>A breezy half-century by</p>
<p>Jonty Rhodes helped South Africa score their third consecutive</p>
<p>victory over hosts India in the Titan Cup limited-overs</p>
<p>triangular series on Tuesday.</p>
<p>South African openers Gary Kirsten and Herschelle Gibbs,</p>
<p>chasing an Indian score of 186 in 50 overs, scored freely in a</p>
<p>stand of 62.</p>
<p>But the South Africans lost two quick wickets and the run</p>
<p>rate dropped against the wiles of the Indian spinners.</p>
<p>Man-of-the-Match Rhodes made 54 off 77 balls, including four</p>
<p>fours and a mighty six, before he was caught by Ajay Jadeja off</p>
<p>Venkatesh Prasad with victory in sight.</p>
<p>Indian captain Sachin Tendulkar won the toss and elected to</p>
<p>bat but his team failed to prosper. Both Navjot Sidhu and Rahul</p>
<p>Dravid were run out.</p>
<p>Javagal Srinath, batting number three, hit a determined 53</p>
<p>in an otherwise lacklustre Indian batting performance.</p>
<p>India's total of 185, their lowest in the competition,</p>
<p>looked an easy target but the South Africans reached it with</p>
<p>only eight balls to spare.</p>
<p>&quot;We did not want to treat it as an easy task and wanted to</p>
<p>concentrate on the job at hand,&quot; South African skipper Hansie</p>
<p>Cronje said.</p>
<p>&quot;And it wasn't easy either, especially when the spinners</p>
<p>came on.&quot;</p>
<p>Tendulkar accused his team of failing to play to their</p>
<p>potential.</p>
<p>&quot;The senior players ought to show greater responsibility,&quot;</p>
<p>he said. &quot;You cannot have experienced players getting run out so</p>
<p>early.&quot;</p>
<p>South Africa have 10 points from five matches and play</p>
<p>Australia in their last match at the north eastern city of</p>
<p>Guwahati on Thursday.</p>
<p>India have three points from a win and an abandoned match</p>
<p>against Australia, who are third with one point. India and</p>
<p>Australia meet for the third time on November 3.</p>
