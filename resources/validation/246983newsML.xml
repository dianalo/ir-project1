<p>Nepal's King Birendra has summoned a special session of parliament to take up a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's coalition government, state-owned radio said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The palace issued a statement read on Radio Nepal saying the monarch had called the session for 1 p.m. (0715 GMT) on December 16.</p>
<p>On Sunday, 11 breakaway deputies of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), holding a crucial balance of power in parliament, announced they were withdrawing support for Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's 15-month-old coalition government.</p>
<p>Seven of 13 RPP ministers resigned from Deuba's 46-member government.</p>
<p>The three-party coalition has controlled 108 seats in the 205-seat lower house, where Deuba's Nepali Congress party has 86 lawmakers. RPP has 19 seats and Nepal Sadbhavana Party (NSP) has three members.</p>
<p>But the opposition United-Marxist-Leninist (UML) party, with 87 deputies, has joined the 11 breakaway RPP lawmakers and had asked King Birendra to convene a special parliamentary session to take up the motion against Deuba.</p>
<p>To topple Deuba's government, his opponent would need at least 103 votes in the 205-seat Lower House of parliament.</p>
<p>The communist and rebel RPP faction claimed they control at least 102 votes while Deuba's Nepali congress has 86 seats.</p>
<p>In March, six RPP ministers resigned from the government, but they quickly patched up their differences with the government in time for Deuba to survive a no-confidence motion.</p>
