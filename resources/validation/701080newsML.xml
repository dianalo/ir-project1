<p>The build-up for England's third test against Australia, which starts at Old Trafford on Thursday, has been dominated by that perennial subject of English conversation - the weather.</p>
<p>After the wettest June in Britain this century, the forecast is for more showers, though there should be more play than the 182 overs - less than two full days - that were possible in the second test at Lord's.</p>
<p>Even in that restricted period, England were uncomfortably close to losing the one-nil lead they established in the six-match Ashes series by winning at Edgbaston last month. They will be happy with overcast conditions and another slow, seaming pitch.</p>
<p>That would encourage them to give a debut to Mike Smith, the 29 year-old Gloucestershire bowler whose left-arm seamers would add a different dimension to the attack. Devon Malcolm, entrusted with only seven overs in the Lord's match, would drop out, leaving Dean Headley of Kent as the 12th man.</p>
<p>After a first practice session at the ground on Tuesday, also delayed by rain, the option of adding another spinner to the team was discounted and Phil Tufnell was released from the 14 originally selected.</p>
<p>Australia, their confidence renewed at Lord's after heavy defeat in the opening test, found further encouragement, and respite from the rain, on the south coast earlier this week, defeating Hampshire by an innings.</p>
<p>Mark Waugh, having made only 39 runs in three test innings, scored 173 and his captain Mark Taylor also recorded a century.</p>
<p>Jason Gillespie pressed his claims for a recall by taking five for 33 in the second Hampshire innings and will dispute the third seamer's position with Mike Kasprowicz.</p>
<p>Taylor has happy memories of Old Trafford, where he made 124 on Australia's last visit, four years ago.</p>
<p>So does leg-spinner Shane Warne, whose first delivery in test cricket in England was in that same match.</p>
<p>Known since then simply as &quot;The Ball&quot;, it pitched outside Mike Gatting's leg-stump and knocked the bail from the off-stump, mesmerising Gatting and the rest of the English team.</p>
<p>Warne became the dominant individual of the series, which Australia won by four matches to one.</p>
<p>He has not been as impressive this time, while England's results and spirit under a new regime led by coach David Lloyd suggest a substantial improvement since then.</p>
<p>The Manchester public, denied a test match last year, have bought every ticket available for the first four days and are hoping that neither the England team nor their city's reputation for wet weather betray their faith.</p>
<p>Probable teams:</p>
<p>England - Michael Atherton (captain), Mark Butcher, Alec Stewart, Nasser Hussain, Graham Thorpe, John Crawley, Mark Ealham, Robert Croft, Darren Gough, Andy Caddick, Mike Smith.</p>
<p>Australia - Mark Taylor (captain), Matthew Elliott, Greg Blewett, Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh, Mark Bevan, Ian Healy, Shane Warne, Paul Reiffel, Jason Gillespie (or Mike Kasprowicz), Glenn McGrath.</p>
