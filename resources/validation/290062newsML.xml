<p>* Toronto stocks ended higher on Tuesday, led by sharp gains in transportation * Laidlaw Inc soars on US$2 billion deals * 112 million shrs traded worth C$1.5 billion  </p>
<p>Toronto stocks ended higher on Tuesday, carried aloft by a sharp rally in transportation shares and an early start to the retirement savings season.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Composite Index climbed 26.16 points to close at 5946.87 in heavy turnover of 112.9 million shares worth C$1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Advancing stocks outnumbered declines 496 to 463 with 282 issues unchanged. The transport group led 11 of 14 sub-groups higher, adding 272 points to close at a high of 6502.75. Investors drove Laidlaw Inc's shares to new heights after it announced two major waste and transportation deals late Monday.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the annual influx of retirement savings money into equities appeared stronger than usual this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Cash flows into mutual funds are running pretty strongly. In Canada, that seems to be a touch ahead of expectations so that is a fortifying factor,&quot; said John Kellett, vice-president of equities for Royal Bank of Canada.</p>
<p>Individual stocks have been stronger leaders than groups on the TSE recently. &quot;It tends to be the specific story that gets people's attention, but the oils continue to do well and the banks have held most of their gains since June,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>--- HOT STOCKS ---</p>
<p>* Laidlaw Inc class B soared 1.80 to 18, a 52-week high, in brisk volume of 9.5 million shares. The company's class A stock gained 1.45 to a close at a high of 17.95.</p>
<p>Analysts applauded the US$1.12 billion acquisition of American Medical Response Inc. which will make Laidlaw the biggest ambulance operator in North America. It also announced plans to spin off its hazardous waste holdings into a new merged company with Rollins Environmental Services.</p>
<p>* Manitoba Telecom Services was also active, ending at 13.80 on 4.5 million shares after trading as high as 13.95. The stock was issued at C$13 a share.</p>
