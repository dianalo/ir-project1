<p>Cuba again featured as an origin on London's sugar freight market on Thursday as a number of fixtures emerged but no fresh inquiry, shipbrokers said.</p>
<p>Genoc was said to have covered its earlier order for 14,000 tonnes of bulk sugar from Cuba to Baltic with options of Casablanca, Mediterranean, Black Sea and Portugal for mid-March dates.</p>
<p>Nissho Iwai fixed 18,000 tonnes of bulk sugar from Cuba to Japan for March dates, shipbrokers said.</p>
<p>Louis Dreyfus fixed 12,000 tonnes of bagged sugar from Thailand to Sri Lanka for mid-March, shipbrokers said. Details of the rate achieved have yet to emerge.</p>
<p>E D &amp; F Man fixed between 20,000 and 25,000 tonnes of bulk sugar from Corinto to lower Baltic with option of Casablanca for prompt dates.</p>
<p>No new inquiry was reported although Lorico is expected to quote on the freight market shortly as it was named as the supplier of 13,000 tonnes of raw sugar to Syria for April in Wednesday's tender.</p>
<p>In other news, Iraq has rescheduled its tender to buy sugar under the U.N. oil-for-food deal to March 7, although the exact amount required is still unclear.</p>
<p>Bangladesh tendered to buy 12,500 tonnes of white sugar with offers to be submitted on March 1. Specified shipment dates are March 11/April 11.</p>
