<p>Zairean rebels agreed on Saturday to a repatriation airlift for up to 100,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees trapped deep inside Zaire, European Union special envoy Aldo Aiello told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I've got a message just a few minutes ago from Mr (Laurent) Kabila that the Kisangani airport will be open and will be made available for the repatriation of refugees,&quot; he said in Kasangani.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council, the European Union, Belgium, France and aid groups have called on Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL) rebels to allow access to Rwandan refugees dying of malnutrition and disease.</p>
<p>Filippo Grandi of the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said he hoped the airlift with chartered aircraft could start in a few days. He said it might last two to three months and would cost less than his earlier estimate of $50 million.</p>
<p>Kabila's senior official dealing with the United Nations, Emmanuel Kamanze, flew to Kisangani with Aiello from rebel headquarters in Goma in eastern Zaire to confirm the airlift agreement.</p>
<p>Zairean rebels had angrily rejected accusations by the international community that they were hindering aid groups trying to help refugees in the east of the country.</p>
<p>Rebel representatives in South Africa for peace talks with the Zairean authorities said earlier they had done their utmost to help relief organisations.</p>
<p>&quot;We have compromised...because we believe that those refugees are, like our population, victims of a dictatorial regime which has been using them as human shields,&quot; rebel spokesman Bizima Karaha told reporters.</p>
<p>Kabila's forces, who have seized a third of the Central African Country, had compromised except where this might harm their own security, said a visibly angry Karaha outside South African government headquarters in Pretoria.</p>
