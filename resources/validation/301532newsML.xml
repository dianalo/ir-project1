<p>After a lightning advance, rebels trying to overthrow Zaire's president Mobutu Sese Seko are facing not only a possible army counter-attack but also sporadic inter-ethnic violence behind their lines.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether to advance further or consolidate is the question. I don't believe they've yet answered that question themselves,&quot; said one western diplomat in neighbouring Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;They have a huge area of territory to defend and run, and they have to do that with only a small number of troops and virtually no money.&quot;</p>
<p>In little over three months, Laurent Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces has taken over a 600 km (400 mile) strip of eastern Zaire bordering Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.</p>
<p>Mobutu faces a challenge as great as any in the 31 years of his rule, which has left the vast mineral-rich country at the heart of Africa as one of the poorest in the world.</p>
<p>But the rebels' own supply lines have grown ever longer and the length of the front ever wider. On top of which Mobutu is reported to have strengthened the ragged band that is his army with foreign mercenaries and soldiers of the former Hutu-dominated Rwandan army.</p>
<p>&quot;We are willing to negotiate, we want to negotiate and our troops are not on the offensive,&quot; said Kabila in Goma, the largest rebel-held town, which has become his base.</p>
<p>&quot;We will only attack if we are attacked ourselves and then nobody will be able to stop us.&quot;</p>
<p>If the rebels manage to capture Kisangani, their previously stated goal, their base would be much more secure, but beyond eastern Zaire's largest city lie thousands of kilometres of virtually roadless forest and swamp that could make any further advance immensely slow.</p>
<p>Kabila's shortage of troops is being addressed by a rapid training programme of thousands of young men who have enlisted in the areas the rebels control -- even including former soldiers of the Zaire army.</p>
<p>Whether or not there is enough time to train them to the level of discipline of the Rwandan-trained ethnic-Tutsis who led the first assault, Kabila already needs to use them.</p>
<p>North of Goma the alliance has fractured and some groups of village warriors, known as Mai-Mai and armed with magic spells as well as guns, have begun attacking their former allies.</p>
<p>To the West lie pockets of Hutu soldiers of the former Rwandan army and militias who did not follow at least 700,000 other refugees home in November.</p>
<p>The Hutus, who fled Rwanda in 1994 after the genocide of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis, are bitterly opposed to the Alliance -- which is backed by Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated army.</p>
<p>While they may not pose a significant military threat, Kabila also has to try and keep the people in the areas he controls satisfied -- or at least persuade them that he is better than what went before.</p>
<p>The only system he can work with is the notoriously corrupt administration left by Mobutu -- and he has no money to run it.</p>
<p>&quot;We can only go on working without money for so long, before we will have to stop or make our grievances known,&quot; said customs inspector Felicien Samosha.</p>
<p>Tiny revenues are now coming in, from exports of hand-dug alluvial gold, coffee and some taxes, and the Alliance was able to give a rice ration to a few of Goma's civil servants early in January.</p>
<p>But the significant potential income that could come from exploiting huge foreign-owned gold concessions in the rebel-controlled territory is not an immediate prospect.</p>
<p>&quot;When we get the mines working we will have everything we need.  The mining companies have been in contact, but they need better guarantees that we are here to stay before they can get back to work,&quot; said one Alliance official.</p>
<p>More than anything the fate of the rebellion depends on Mobutu, the man it has set out to overthrow.</p>
<p>After cancer treatment last year the military strongman spent less than a month in Zaire, where he appointed a crisis government and new army commander, before returning to his home in the South of France last week.</p>
<p>The country that he said would fall apart without him waits anxiously to see how long he will live, and who or what will take over when he dies.</p>
<p>&quot;I am certain that if there is a government or a new military leader to negotiate with, then Kabila will try and look for a place for himself. Even with his current position he has a strong claim,&quot; said one western diplomat.</p>
