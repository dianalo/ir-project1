<title>SINGAPORE: Asia Fuel Oil- Stable with firm swaps and crude.</title>
<headline>Asia Fuel Oil- Stable with firm swaps and crude.</headline>

<p>The high sulphur fuel oil market was stable on Wednesday amid cautious sentiment with most traders focusing on the movement of a local trading company which had been aggressive since last week.</p>
<p>The aggressive bids from a local trading company pushed up prices early last week but did not succeed in maintaining prices at high levels.</p>
<p>The 180-cst grade was heard offered at $98/$99 per tonne.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a Japanese trader bought two 20,000-tonne cargoes of 180-cst grade at $99 and $98.5 per tonne respectively for April 5-9 and April 6-10 lifting.  </p>
<p>&quot;The local trading company is not bidding up prices, but it has been preventing prices from going down,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The 180-cst grade was offered at $99 per tonne on Monday and $101 on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think prices should continue coming off,&quot; the trader added.</p>
<p>One or two cargoes are coming in from Kuwait, adding to supplies in Singapore where some maintenance turnarounds will take place this month, a trader said.  </p>
<p>&quot;But there should not be any significant changes in supply and demand. The turnarounds have been planned before hand,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Fuel oil swaps edged higher, with March last quoted at $98.50/$100.00 and April at $96.50/$97.50 compared with $97.50/$98.50 and $95.50/$96.50 respectively.</p>
<p>Chinese buyers remained absence and inactive in the Singapore market, though traders said China has been getting supplies from South Korea and Japan since they stayed away from Singapore in early February.  </p>
<p>The LSWR market is quiet with buying interest seen swayed towards the Duri market.</p>
<p>Traders said current LSWR prices are too high compared to alternative burning crude like Duri which priced more competitively.</p>
<p>&quot;I would rather buy Duri,&quot; said one potential buyer. Duri is currently assessed at $17.00 per barrel.</p>
