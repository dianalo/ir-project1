<p>Xerox Corp. may have a hard time finding buyers for its five Talegen insurance units after buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s surprise decision to walk away from a $2.7 billion deal to buy the entire group, analysts said Thursday.</p>
<p>Both parties announced the decision Wednesday but declined to say why the deal, potentially one of the industry's largest, was called off.</p>
<p>Industry analysts pointed to a possible actuarial dispute over reserves and concerns about deteriorating industry fundamentals since KKR struck the deal with Xerox in January.</p>
<p>Stamford, Conn.-based Xerox said it believed that the reserves for its various Talegen units are adequate and that the companies are healthy. KKR declined to comment.</p>
<p>The document processing company also said it was prepared to sell the Talegen group in pieces and still expected to get about the same price that KKR had agreed to pay.</p>
<p>The news drove Xerox shares down about 5 percent or $3.25 to $54.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>KKR's decision to call off the deal also could have a chilling effect on other property-casualty insurance deals, which have featured prominently in this year's booming corporate merger market.</p>
<p>&quot;This transaction is interesting because it could mark the beginning of a shift in the other direction in which it's no longer quite such a sellers' market and in that respect it would have implications for other deals and for stock valuations,&quot; Oppenheimer analyst Alice Schroeder said.</p>
<p>Although other potential KKR targets would benefit from the collapse of this deal, it still may send a negative signal about the industry, Lehman analyst Peter Wade said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think any time you have a big deal like this (that falls apart) that's going to have a negative impact on other deals,&quot; Wade said. &quot;I don't think it's a good day for mergers and acquisitions in the insurance industry as a whole.&quot;</p>
<p>Although Xerox is likely to find buyers fairly quicky for one or two of its Talegen units, the others -- especially Crum &amp; Forster -- will be a tough sell, analysts said.</p>
<p>Crum &amp; Forster, a middle market commercial insurer, wrote a substantial amount of asbestos and environmental coverage and has little to attract prospective buyers, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Crum and Forster is in the most competitive part of the insurance industry with only limited competitive advantages,&quot; Wade said.</p>
<p>Xerox will find a buyer for it, he said, but the question will be at what price.</p>
<p>But Xerox's professional liability insurer Coregis was likely to attract a buyer quickly, analysts said. Its workers compensation insurer, Industrial Indemnity, and its excess and surplus lines insurer, Westchester Speciality, also may be fairly marketable, analysts said.</p>
