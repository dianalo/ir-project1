<p>Alliance national director Matt McCarten on Wednesday said a series of misunderstandings led to Green Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons threatening to resign as deputy leader of the left-wing Alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;Some issues were raised and we all have our perspective ... and it has all been resolved. There were a number of misunderstandings,&quot; McCarten said in a telephone interview.  </p>
<p>The threat, made in a memo to the Alliance's caucus which was leaked to the New Zealand Herald, painted a picture of long- standing resentment over Fitzsimons' treatment during and since the 1996 election campaign.</p>
<p>Green co-leader Rod Donald, who has championed a separate identity for the Greens within the Alliance, said it was wrong to say the leaked memo showed tensions between the Greens and the strongest party in the Alliance, NewLabour, had grown.</p>
<p>&quot;If we tried to portray things as always rosy, no one would believe us, but we are not actually at each others' throats either,&quot; he told Reuters.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is no growth in the tension. There is always a creative tension in any organisation ... and in a coalition those tensions tend, but do not always, manifest themselves along party lines.&quot;</p>
<p>The opposition Alliance's vote dropped sharply to 10 percent at the November 12 election and some in the five party grouping have questioned the way McCarten, a NewLabour stalwart, had handled his role.  </p>
<p>McCarten said he had a role to play and if people took different views, that was healthy. Asked if there were personal differences between him and Fitzsimons, he said: &quot;I never take anything personally. It is all political and I deal with it on that basis.&quot;</p>
<p>He said there was no deliberate attempt to exclude Fitzsimons from decisions.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes people are getting on with things and communications are not as good as they could be. I understand she is satisfied with the answers she had.&quot;  </p>
<p>He stopped short of taking responsibility for the misunderstandings.</p>
<p>In the January 22 memo, Fitzsimons said she would resign as deputy Alliance leader if she was again excluded from decisions &quot;where it is suspected that I might have a different point of view from those who run this organisation&quot;.</p>
<p>She complained at the treatment of herself and a Green colleague who was rejected for a job in the &quot;party building unit&quot;.  </p>
<p>&quot;If we run our own affairs and treat our own people this way, we are not fit to run the country and will never deliver anything better to New Zealanders,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Fitzsimons told the Herald the resignation threat was a last resort. Tuesday's caucus and an earlier meeting with Alliance leader Jim Anderton had addressed those issues seriously. With the commitment to improve, she was not resigning.</p>
