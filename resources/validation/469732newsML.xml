<p>Belgium's largest steel maker Cockerill Sambre said on Wednesday it plunged into the red in 1996, weighed down by an extraordinary loss, but it was hopeful of a small profit in 1997.</p>
<p>Cockerill booked a 9.00 billion franc group loss in 1996, reversing a 3.2 billion franc net profit in 1995, partly because of a 7.7 billion franc exceptional loss.</p>
<p>The company said it had made six billion francs of provisions to cover a part of its &quot;Horizon 2000&quot; plan, which aims to make the company competitive and which will entail 2,000 job losses.</p>
<p>Consolidated turnover dipped slightly to 203.1 billion francs from 206.7 billion a year earlier, while crude steel production edged up to 6.35 million tonnes from 6.33 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Steel prices have fallen throughout 1996 and the first quarter of 1997 started with very low prices. Steel price rises have been registered for second-quarter deliveries. If this trend continues, integrated steel results would become positive again in 1997,&quot; Cockerill said.</p>
<p>Cockerill also said that profits of its distribution and building divisions should compensate for the losses which could continue to hit its mechanical and automobile equipment divisions.</p>
<p>It added that the group should start to fully benefit from the positive impact of its competitivity plan in 1998.</p>
<p>Because of the large 1996 loss, Cockerill said it would pay no dividend. The group paid a gross dividend of 25.6 francs per preferred share on 1995 earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is a little profit in 1997, there will be a dividend, though perhaps not a full one,&quot; Cockerill chairman Jean Gandois said.</p>
<p>He also said that an alliance with another group was a possibility for the long term.</p>
<p>However Cockerill would have to become more competitive before he would enter into any partnership negotiations.</p>
<p>Asked whether he feared Cockerill would be left isolated after the merger of the steel divisions of German industry giants Krupp and Thyssen, he said: &quot;I don't fear isolation. I'm ready to negotiate (for a partner) when it appears necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>This could be &quot;sooner than previously thought&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there are some people who would be interested but I want to have made progress on Cockerill's Horizon 2000 plan first,&quot; he added.</p>
