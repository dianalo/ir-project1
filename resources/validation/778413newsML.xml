<p>Airlines flying to and from Kenya cancelled, diverted or rescheduled flights on Tuesday on the fourth day of a go-slow by air traffic controllers demanding Aviation officials said talks collapsed on Monday when the Bair controllers rejected a government request to return to work and give Kenyan authorities two weeks to study their demands.</p>
<p>They said air controllers believed the government wanted only to buy time instead of meet their demands for more pay and benefits and the controllers might step up their action, which began at midnight on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation might get worse unless some agreeement is reached. At the moment there are three-hour delays, but they could delay things for six hours,&quot; said an airport official.</p>
<p>&quot;If by Wednesday there is no solution they might intensify the go slow,&quot; said the official, adding no talks were planned on Tuesday and the case would probably go to the labour minister.</p>
<p>National carrier Kenya Airways said it was forced to cancel six flights on Tuesday and Wednesday and reschedule others.</p>
<p>A Saudi Arabian Airlines plane was turned back to Jeddah without landing in Nairobi on Monday, an airline official said.</p>
<p>Aviation sources said flights due to land in Nairobi were also being diverted to airports in Tanzania or Ethiopia.</p>
<p>&quot;We have cancelled most of our flights for the day and there will be other measures as air controllers have increased the time they delay departures or landings,&quot; said a Kenya Airways official.</p>
<p>Cargo and tourist carriers are particularly hard hit with flowers for export stuck without any chance of catching connections . Airlines are having to pay for tourists to stay in hotels.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an inconvenience we can do without,&quot; Samuel Mwaura, chairman of the Kenya Association of Tour Operators told Reuters. &quot;Any new roadblock in the path of tourism is not good for business.&quot;</p>
<p>Airports at Nairobi, the coast city of Mombasa, Kisumu and the tourist resort of Malindi were affected by the go-slow.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers are demanding a 50-fold increase from what they say is pay of about $90 a month, plus benefits.</p>
<p>Tour operators, hotel managers and taxi drivers said they were losing business as a result of the go-slow which, like a dispute in December, coincided with a busy tourist season.</p>
<p>Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International airport is the main cargo and passenger hub for East Africa and for some air cargo carriers is even more important than airports in South Africa, the continent's economic leader.</p>
<p>Air cargo giant Lufthansa Cargo said the go-slow could cost the industry millions of dollars if it continued much longer.</p>
<p>The go-slow increased pressure on a government hit by the International Monetary Fund on Thursday halting a $205 million aid package to Kenya, citing concern at high-level corruption.</p>
<p>Tourism is Kenya's largest single hard currency earner with 717,000 visitors in 1996.</p>
<p>An opposition-backed alliance pressing for constitutional reform in Kenya has called for a national strike on Friday.</p>
<p>Nine people were killed in violence across Kenya last month when police violently dispersed rallies calling for reforms.</p>
