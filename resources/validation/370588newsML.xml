<p>The parents of Nicole Brown Simpson Monday said they were pleased with the $25 million punitive damages awarded against O.J. Simpson for the deaths of their daughter and her friend, Ronald Goldman.</p>
<p>In a rare public expression of their feelings, Lou and Juditha Brown said they sought the damages on behalf of their grandchildren, Justin and Sydney Simpson, who are now living with their father.</p>
<p>&quot;Our intent was completely and totally for the two children,&quot; said Lou Brown.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar amount does not come to us. It's very significant that it shows that our attorneys finally got through to a jury and we are very happy with the reaction of the jury,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Simpson won custody of the children in December.</p>
<p>Asked how the Browns felt about their grandchildren living with Simpson, Juditha Brown said, &quot;There's nothing I can do and I'm not going to make myself bitter about it either.&quot;</p>
<p>Fighting back tears, she said, &quot;Life goes on, every day is a step of healing.&quot;</p>
<p>Immediately following the punitive damages verdict Monday, Gloria Allred, the attorney who was involved in the custody battle on behalf of the Browns, declined to comment on whether the award would have any effect on the custody of the children.</p>
<p>But she said, &quot;there's more to come,&quot; adding she expected an announcement Tuesday.</p>
<p>The punitive damages of $12.5 million for each victim were in addition to the $8.5 million compensatory award the jury imposed last Tuesday when it found Simpson responsible for the 1994 killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</p>
<p>Jurors voted 10-2 in favour of awarding $12.5 million in punitive damages to Goldman's divorced parents and 10-2 again to give $12.5 million to the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson, whose heirs are her children -- Sydney, 11, and Justin, 8.</p>
<p>Simpson was cleared of murder charges in the criminal trial in October 1995 but the victims' families pressed ahead with a wrongful-death lawsuit in civil court.</p>
