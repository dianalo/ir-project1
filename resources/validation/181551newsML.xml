<p>The Athens bourse failed to open on time on Monday in a continuing dispute about clearing deals.</p>
<p>Brokers association members were locked in an angry meeting on how to resolve problems after one firm defaulted with the exchange's clearing house last week.  </p>
<p>Discussion continued among the brokerages with Athens bourse president Manolis Xanthakis joining a stormy meeting at the Association of Athens Stock Exchange Members (SMEXA).</p>
<p>&quot;The prevailing sentiment is that we won't open, the odds are aginst this happening. As it stands, there are 65 different opinions on how to tackle the problem,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>All 65 SMEXA members were present and arguing continued well past the opening time for the session.</p>
<p>On Friday, Apostolos Fotiadis, the national economy ministry's general secretary in charge of the bourse had predicted that trading would resume normally on Monday.</p>
<p>He told reporters that exchange member Delta Securities was in the red with the clearing house for 2.6 billion drachmas and that any shareholder losses would be covered by the exchange's guarantee fund.</p>
<p>Conservative opposition leader Miltiadis Evert issued a statement saying the bourse was facing an unprecedented crisis and that the problem with Delta was only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>&quot;There is great corruption. If the investigation is limited to only one brokerage we will soon face new problems that will undermine the stock market's credibility. The public prosecutor must step in and investigate all aspects of the problem,&quot; Evert said. --George Georgiopoulos, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
