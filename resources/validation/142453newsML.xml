<p>Despite the dire effects of sanctions on the Iraqi people, implementation of a U.N. oil-for-food plan continues to be delayed, with some envoys saying they do not expect the deal to go ahead for months.</p>
<p>At issue is an arrangement that would allow Iraq to sell $2 billion of oil over six months, on a renewable basis, to buy food, medicine and other necessities to help offset the impact on ordinary Iraqis of sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.</p>
<p>Iraq, in a 14-page memorandum to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday, said the sanctions threatened its society with a &quot;horrendous disaster that may lead to its collapse,&quot; and accused Washington of attempting genocide.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Iraq says the plan cannot be implemented until the United States approves an oil pricing formula that all other Security Council members have endorsed. Iraq has also put restrictions on U.N. staff that would help carry out the plan that U.N. officials find unacceptable.</p>
<p>U.N. Under-Secretary-General Chinmaya Gharekhan told reporters on Wednesday that &quot;Iraq cannot move ahead with implementation&quot; of the plan unless the Security Council's sanctions committee agrees on oil pricing formulas, which serve as the basis for contracts determining the cost of Iraq's petroleum.</p>
<p>The last formula was presented to the Council's sanctions committee in August. It was approved by U.S., Norwegian and Russian oil experts appointed by the United Nations but blocked by the United States.</p>
<p>An agreed-on pricing plan would avoid the necessity of individual contracts' going through the committee and allow the oil experts or overseers to approve them.</p>
<p>The envoys said Iraqi diplomats, in private conversations, had stressed their fear that Washington wanted the ability to stop the deal at any point by forcing each contract to go through the full committee, where any one member can oppose it.</p>
<p>The commitee, headed by German Ambassador Tono Eitel, consists of all Security Council members.</p>
<p>At the same time, U.S. officials believe that some Iraqi authorities, opposed to the deal from the start, are looking for reasons to continue postponing it.</p>
<p>Arrangements to launch the plan were close to completion when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent troops into the largely Kurdish-inhabited north of the country at the end of August to back one side in an inter-Kurdish conflict.</p>
<p>Since then Iraq has told the United Nations it would decide what local staff members would work with the United Nations and restrict the movement of U.N. personnel in the north.</p>
<p>Both demands are unacceptable, but the diplomats said Iraqi officials appeared hopeful these issues could be resolved if the pricing formula controversy was solved.</p>
<p>The United Nations said an advance team of three U.N.-hired oil inspectors from the Dutch-based Saybolt firm would arrive in Baghdad on Thursday and stay about a week. The inspectors were pulled out of Iraq in September when the fighting in the north began.</p>
