<p>China's zinc exports are expected to continue to rise if international prices hold at present high levels, metals officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>China's exports of unwrought zinc and zinc alloys hit 198,386 tonnes in the first five months of 1997, a rise of 129.3 percent compared with the year-ago period, customs figures showed.</p>
<p>&quot;It will depend on the international prices,&quot; an official of the China National Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corp told Reuters by telephone. &quot;Exports could continue rising if prices remain at current high levels.&quot;</p>
<p>Three-month zinc on the London Metal Exchange (LME) notched up a fresh high of $1,415 since October 1990 on Monday, before losing ground to finish $9.50 stronger at $1,408.50.</p>
<p>However, the official said it was hard to predict the level of China's zinc exports this year because of the uncertainty on the international market as well as other factors that could affect China's zinc supply.</p>
<p>&quot;Zinc exports could be restrained by shortages of raw materials, such as zinc ore,&quot; she said, without giving details.</p>
<p>China's zinc sales could also be limited by export quotas issued by the government, she said. The government sets export quotas to guarantee sufficient supplies for domestic use.</p>
<p>Some of China's major smelters have won the right to export without going through state trading firms, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is normal to boost zinc exports when prices are high,&quot; said an official of the China National Non-ferrous Metals Import and Export Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;But current prices are a bit too high,&quot; he said, &quot;Prices could slip in the future.&quot;</p>
<p>Western traders have voiced doubts over whether China's zinc producers can maintain current production levels unless zinc ore imports increased.</p>
<p>Sources at China's Huludao and Zhuzhou smelters said domestic supplies of zinc ore posed no problem.</p>
<p>Huludao zinc smelter, in northeastern Liaoning province, had 35,000 tonnes of zinc ore in stock, a source there said this week. This was enough for about two months production of zinc metal.</p>
<p>Sources at Zhuzhou Smelter have said the smelter kept two months supply or ore, or about 40,000 tonnes, on hand.</p>
<p>Two tonnes of ore produces one tonne of metal.</p>
<p>Zhuzhou smelter exported 60,000 tonnes of zinc ingots and zinc products, including alloys, in the first five months, up 135 percent from the same year-ago period, a company official said. -- Beijing Newsroom (8610) 6532 1921</p>
