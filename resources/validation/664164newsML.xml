<title>UK: Two Northern Irish police officers shot dead.</title>

<p>Two Northern Ireland policemen were shot dead by suspected Irish republican guerrillas in the town of Lurgan on Monday.</p>
<p>Police sources said the officers were on routine patrol in a built-up area when they were shot in the head at close range.</p>
<p>&quot;The two police officers are dead. They were fatally wounded at the scene,&quot; a security source told Reuters.</p>
<p>Security forces sealed off the ambush area, some 20 miles (35 km) southwest of Belfast.</p>
<p>The attack happened shortly before before 1100 GMT. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland has been tense for months since the main guerrilla group seeking to unite Northern Ireland with the neighbouring Republic of Ireland, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), resumed attacks on security forces there after abandoning a ceasefire in February 1996.</p>
<p>Last month a republican splinter group, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), shot dead an off-duty police officer in a crowded pub in Belfast.</p>
<p>It was widely feared that Monday's attack would put further pressure on a shaky truce by &quot;Loyalist&quot; groups, who want Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very clear that this was carried out by republicans of one description or another,&quot; said Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party.</p>
<p>Loyalists have killed two people in the past year and set off sporadic bombs aimed at republicans, apparently in retaliation for republican hostilities.</p>
