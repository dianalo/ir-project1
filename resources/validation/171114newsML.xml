<p>Hardware, engineering and shipping group Howard Smith Ltd said on Wednesday it expects to see improvements in all its operating divisions in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Managing director Ken Moss repeated forecasts at the annual general meeting of a rise in profit before abnormals in 1996/97, although he said later the first half would be &quot;line-ball&quot;.</p>
<p>This followed the company's withdrawal from shipping, which meant earnings before interest and tax from this division would fall to about A$2 million in 1996/97 from about A$12 million in the 1995/96 year.  </p>
<p>The shortfall would be made up in other divisions during the year but not necessarily in the half year, he said, although the first quarter performance was up ON last year's.</p>
<p>&quot;The half year is going to be satisfactory under the circumstances, but I don't expect it to be greatly up on last year's first half,&quot; Moss told reporters.</p>
<p>The sale of the company's remaining two ships, to be completed by February 1997, is expected to generate an abnormal profit of A$30 million over 1996/97 and 1997/98.</p>
<p>Moss said the expansion of BBC Hardware Houses would be the key to growth for the company.  </p>
<p>The number of stores was expected to rise to 30 by the end of 1997 from 16 at present, increasing both profit and margins due to the high retail content of the stores.</p>
<p>Chairman Frank Conroy earlier told shareholders BBC Hardware group sales were marginally up in the first quarter, although trade sales remained subdued with no evidence of a pick-up in the domestic housing market.</p>
<p>Moss said improved profits from the Goninin engineering division would flow mainly from its A$840 million contract to supply locomotives and other rolling stock to the National Rail Corp.  </p>
<p>The first locomotive was due to be handed over in a ceremony at Newcastle on November 28.</p>
<p>The Blackwood's industrial and engineering supplies distribution business would also improve, while marine towage would be up on last year, but not significantly.</p>
<p>Howard Smith reported a 1995/96 full year net profit of A$86.13 million in August, up from $A77.06 million previously.</p>
