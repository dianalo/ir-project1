<p>North Korea on Tuesday marks the third anniversary of the death of its founding father, &quot;Great Leader&quot; Kim Il-sung, with no sign yet of his eldest son taking the formal titles to crown communism's first dynastic succession.</p>
<p>The July 8 anniversary, which ends the formal three-year mourning period in Korean culture, has long been regarded as the trigger for &quot;Dear Leader&quot; Kim Jong-il to assume two key posts held by his father -- general secretary of the ruling Workers' Party and state president.</p>
<p>However Korea watchers believe the long-awaited announcement on a power transfer is likely to be delayed now because of North Korea's economic woes and famine.</p>
<p>Kim, 55, supreme commander of North Korea's one million strong military, and undisputed leader in all but name of the Stalinist nation, is now more likely to be crowned towards the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as economic turmoil grips the country, there may not be a formal power succession,&quot; said Noriyuki Suzuki, chief analyst at Radiopress, a Tokyo-based news agency that monitors North Korean media.</p>
<p>Suzuki said Kim was likely to delay taking over the top government and party posts until Pyongyang secured enough food to feed its 22 million people and stave off famine.</p>
<p>&quot;Formal succession is not expected to come before the end of August because of fears that the country could be hit by floods again in that month,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Kim would take the posts only after confirming Pyongyang had secured enough food to feed its people,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has said North Korea could run out of food some time this month, the result of two consecutive years of record floods.</p>
<p>North Korea formally agreed last Monday to attend a meeting on August 5 in New York of senior officials from the two Koreas, the United States and China to arrange four-nation talks on a peace treaty for the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>Threatened by famine and with its economy in ruins, North Korea linked its participation to a specific commitment on food aid and an end to U.S. trade sanctions.</p>
<p>Washington and Seoul have made clear the issues will be discussed as part of peace negotiations.</p>
<p>Masao Okonogi, a Korea expert at Tokyo's Keio University, said it was highly likely that North Korea would get the food to survive the food crisis at least for the next several months.</p>
<p>&quot;But even if the food crisis is resolved, Kim Jong-il then has to go through the tough test of economic reconstruction within a year or two,&quot; Okonogi said.</p>
<p>He said Kim would most likely assume the top party post in October when North Korea celebrates the 52nd anniversary of the founding of the North Korean Workers' Party.</p>
<p>He said Kim might even change the power structure by giving the symbolic post of state president to someone loyal to him.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an outside chance that someone other than Kim Jong-il could become state president,&quot; Okonogi told Reuters.</p>
<p>As part of his efforts to consolidate his power base, Kim earlier this year promoted 120 young officers loyal to him to the rank of general.</p>
<p>Japan's Sankei Shimbun newspaper said on Saturday Kim planned more government and military changes in the next few months to strengthen his hand in taking formal charge.</p>
<p>Radiopress's Suzuki said Kim's skilful handling of the nation despite daunting odds like the food crisis had made the whole succession question less of an issue.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no challengers to him,&quot; Suzuki said. &quot;Therefore there is less pressure on him to to take on the titles.&quot;</p>
