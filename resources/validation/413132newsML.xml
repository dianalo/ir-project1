<title>INDIA: India sees GDP growth at over 7.0 pct in 1997/98.</title>
<headline>India sees GDP growth at over 7.0 pct in 1997/98.</headline>
<dateline>NEW DELHI 1997-03-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>India said on Saturday it was confident its economy would grow at a real rate of seven percent or more, and inflation would stay in the 6.5-7.0 percent rate in the fiscal year starting on April 1.</p>
<p>&quot;Our view is that we will see real GDP growth of seven percent-plus and we will see perhaps inflation at most for the average of the year at 6.5 to 7.0 percent,&quot; Shankar Acharya, chief economic adviser in the Finance Ministry, told a news conference.  </p>
<p>India's year-on-year inflation rate measured by the wholesale price index (WPI) rose to 7.99 percent in the week ending February 8 from 7.73 percent in the previous week.</p>
<p>The government estimates that GDP will expand by 6.8 percent in the 1996/97 fiscal year ending on March 31, compared with 7.1 percent in the previous year.</p>
<p>Acharya said he thought WPI might go up by one or two percentage points in the remainder of the current fiscal year. &quot;But I am quite confident that with this budget you will see a decline in the rate of inflation throughout next year.&quot;</p>
<p>He was speaking a day after Finance Minister P. Chidambaram unveiled a bold, business-friendly budget for the 1997/98 year that slashed taxes and tariffs and took the six-year-old reform of the Indian economy forward in a big leap.  </p>
<p>* Licensing, price control and requisitioning under the Cold Storage Order; 1964 will be removed. The Edible Oils and Edible Oil Seeds Storage Control Order, 1977 and the Cotton Control Order, 1986 will be invoked only in well-defined emergency situations. Domestic futures trading would be resumed in respect of ginned and baled cotton, baled raw jute and jute goods. An international Castor Oil Futures Exchange will be set up. I urge State governments to follow this lead and abolish as many controls as possible.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>SMALL SCALE INDUSTRY:</p>
<p>* As Hon'ble Members are aware, government has recently enhanced the investment ceiling for plant and machinery of small scale industries (SSIs) to 30 million rupees and of tiny units to 2.5 million rupees. In order to ensure that credit is available to all segments of the now-enlarged SSI sector, the RBI is issuing instructions that out of the funds normally available to the SSI sector, 40 percent will be reserved for units with investment in plant and machinery upto 500,000 rupees, 20 percent for units with investment between 500,000 rupees and 2.5 million rupees and the remaining 40 percent for other SSI units.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>* Government also announced recently that it will examine carefully the other recommendations of the Abid Hussain Committee on the SSI sector. With a view to reduce wastage in agricultural commodities, improve quality and hygiene and promote exports, the Advisory Committee on reservation and dereservation has recommended that 14 items, now reserved for manufacture in the SSI sector, may be dereserved. 822 items would still remain reserved for production in the SSI sector. Government has accepted these recommendations. The dereserved items include rice milling, dal milling, poultry feed, vinegar, synthetic syrups, biscuits, ice cream, a variety of automobile parts and corrugated paper and boards. It is expected that new investment and improved technology will flow into these businesses.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>HOUSING:</p>
<p>* A constraint on adding to the housing stock of the country is the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976. It is the intention of the government to move a Bill for amending the Act in this session of Parliamnet.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>* Indira Awas Yojana was launched to build houses for the poor in rural areas. Housing finance companies provide credit but the bulk of such credit flows into the urban and semi-urban areas. There are some rural housing credit programmes but they lend meagre amounts upto Rs.10,000. There is virtually no source of credit for the farmer who wishes to build a modest house on his freehold land or to improve or add to his old dwelling. This gap must be filled. In consultation with the National Housing Bank (NHB) and others, I have worked out a plan. Loans, upto Rs.2 lakhs will be given for building houses on freehold land in rural areas at normal rates of interest, subject to the borrower putting in one-third of the value of the house. NHB has been requested to prepare a scheme in which other organisations will also participate. The Prime Minister will launch the scheme on August 15, 1997 and it is our goal to sanction 50,000 loans in the first year.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>EMPLOYEES' PROVIDENT FUND &amp; GRATUITY</p>
<p>* The Central Board of Trustees of the Employees' provident Fund (EPF) has made specific proposals to make the EPF schemes financially more attractive. Government has also looked at the matter from the point of view of augmenting savings. I am happy to announce the following decisions:</p>
<p>+ The rate of contribution in all industries and establishments will be increased from 8.33% to 10% for both employers and employees with effect from March 1, 1997.</p>
<p>+ In the scheduled industries where the rate of contribution is now 10%, the Act will be amended to make the rate 12% for both employers and employees.</p>
<p>+ The requirement of keeping 20% of incremental PF amounts in the Special Deposit Scheme (SDS) will be withdrawn with effect from April 1, 1997 and the Board of Trustees will be free to invest this portion of the funds in any of the other three kinds of permitted securities.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>* In 1995 the Central government enhanced the ceiling on the amount of gratuity payable from Rs.1 lakh to Rs.2.5 lakh for Central government employees. I am now pleased to announce that the benefit will be extended to all employees covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, which will be amended for this purpose.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>PUBLIC SECTOR AUTONOMY</p>
<p>* The CMP promised that &quot;the United Front government will identify public sector companies that have comparative advantages and will support them in their drive to become global giants.&quot; To begin with, nine well-performing public sector enterprises, the Navaratnas, have been identified. These are IOC, ONGC, HPCL, BPCL, IPCL, VSNL, BHEL, SAIL and NTPC. The Industry Minister will shortly unveil a package of measures that will help them achieve this objective. He will also make a full statement on managerial and commercial autonomy  to all PSUs.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>* In the meanwhile, government has decided to delegate more monetary powers to the Boards of profit-making enterprises. for these PSUs, the existing limits for capital expenditure that can be incurred without the prior approval of the government is being doubled straight-away and where the gross block is over Rs.500 crore, the limit will be Rs.100 crore.</p>
<p>. DISINVESTMENT</p>
<p>* The Disinvestment Commission was constituted in August, 1996 and 40 PSUs were referred to the Commission for advice. The Commission has submitted its first report. It has made specific recommendations in respect of three companies. We intend to proceed with the disinvestment in these companies along the lines suggested by the Commission. While the Commission will make further reports every month, a second batch of PSUs has been referred to the Commission. As the Commission has observed &quot;The essence of a long-term disinvestment strategy should be not only to enhance budgetary receipts, but also minimise budgetary support towards unprofitable units while ensuring their long-term viability and sustainable levels of employment in them.&quot; Government agrees with this view and I would appeal to Hon'ble Members to take a positive view of disinvestment.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>OIL AND GAS:</p>
<p>The country's demand for petroleum products is growing at over 8 percent per annum, which is faster than the growth of domestic supply. We cannot choke this growth. At the same time, we must reduce our dependence on imported petroleum products. There is no real alternative to increasing the supply. Just 6 of the 26 basins that have potential for oil and gas in India have been explored, and that too only partially. The Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas will be making a detailed statement on the new exploration licensing policy (NELP) shortly. The highlights of the policy are the following:</p>
<p>+ Companies, including ONGC and OIL, will be paid the international price of oil for new discoveries made under the NELP.</p>
<p>+ Royalty payments will be fixed on an ad valorem basis instead of the present system of specific rates;</p>
<p>+ Royalty payments for exploraton in deep waters will be charged at half the rate for offshore areas for the first seven years after commencement of commercial production;</p>
<p>+ Freedom for marketing crude oil and gas in the domestic market;</p>
<p>+ Tax holiday for seven years after commencement of commercial production for blocks in the North-East region.</p>
<p>+ ONGC and OIL will get the same duty concessions on import of capital goods under the NELP as private production sharing contracts.</p>
<p>+ Cess levied under the Oil Industry Development Act, 1974 will be abolished for the new exploration blocks; and</p>
<p>+ A separate petroleum tax code will be put in place as in other countries to facilitate new investments.</p>
<p>It is my fervent hope that Indian and foreign companies will respond positively to this package of measures.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>* In order to ensure that adequate domestic refining capacity is created. I propose to allow refineries to import capital goods during the Ninth Plan period at a concessional duty on par with the fertiliser sector. Domestic capital goods suppliers will also get deemed export status.</p>
<p>.  </p>
<p>INFRASTRUCTURE:</p>
<p>* The Infrastructure Development Finance Company has been incorporated. Section 80IA of the Income Tax Act grants a five year tax holiday for certain infrastructure projects. Last month, I announced that telecommunication will qualify as infrastructure. I now propose to add Oil Exploration and Industrial Parks to this category.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>* I am also glad to announce that the vexed question of assignability of telecom licences has been resolved and that tripartite agreements are proposed to be entered into among the Department of Telecommunications, the licencee and the lenders.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>* As Commerce Minister, I proposed in the Exim Policy that supply of goods to oil, gas and power projects, if the supplies are made under the procedure of international competitive bidding, should be given the benefits of 'deemed exports'. As Finance Minister, I am glad to accept this wholesome proposal. Details are being notified separately.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>* The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is now geared to implement the new policy on roads and highways. I propose to enhance budget support for NHAI to Rs.500 crore which is a significant step up from Rs.200 crore provided in the current year.</p>
<p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT:</p>
<p>* Foreign Institutional investors (FIIs) continue to repose great confidence in India. Net FII investment in India is now over U$$ 7 billion. During the course of this year I have expanded the opportunities for such investments. I propose to take one more step at the instance of Indian companies. The limit of aggregate investment in a company by FIIs, NRIs and NRI-OCBs is now 24%. I propose to allow companies to raise this limit to 30%, subject to the condition that the Board Directors of the company approves the limit and the general body of the company passes a special resolution in this behalf.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>* Venture capital funds are important vehicles for stimulating investments in new ventures. Under the present guidelines they can invest upto 5% of their corpus in the equity of any single company. This is unduly restrictive. The limit is being increased to 20%.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>CAPITAL MARKET</p>
<p>* Over 20 million Indians have invested their savings in the capital market. The establishment of the first Depository was an important step taken to bring the Indian capital market upto world standards and to protect the interests of the investors. SEBI was asked to suggest more measures. The committee appointed by me to draft a new Companies Bill has also made valuable suggestions. After considering these suggestions, I propose to accept five recommendations.</p>
<p>+ The principle of buy-back of shares by companies subject to certain conditions will be introduced in the Companies Act;</p>
<p>+ The provision of Sections 370 and 372 of the Companies Act will be merged and an overall ceiling of 60 percent will be kept for intercorporate investment and loans;</p>
<p>+ The Companies Act will be amended to provide for nomination facilities for holders of securities;</p>
<p>+ Companies raising funds from the capital market will be required to give an annual statement disclosing the end-use of such funds; and</p>
<p>+ One time permission will be given to stockbrokers to corporatise their businesses without attracting tax on capital gains, which will be exempted.</p>
<p>I am of the firm view that markets will prosper when economic growth continues to be strong, the fiscal deficit is reduced, interest rates decline and investors are reassured that their interests are secure.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>FERA AND MONEY LAUNDERING:</p>
<p>* As we progress towards a more open economy with greater trade and investment linkages with the rest of the world, the regulations governing foreign exchange transactions also need to be modernised. It is generally acknowledged that the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 needs to be replaced by a new law consistent with full current account convertibility and our objective of progressively liberalising capital account transactions. Hence, I propose to introduce, later this year a Bill titled 'The Foreign Exchange Management Act'. An RBI appointed group is expected to complete the drafting of the Bill shortly.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>* While FERA is being replaced, we will not let up in our effort to curb the laundering of ill-gotten money. A Bill dealing with money laundering is under preparation and I propose to introduce it during this session of Parliament.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>CAPITAL ACCOUNT CONVERTIBILITY:</p>
<p>* A little while ago I made a reference to capital account convertibility. We are proud of our foreign exchange earners. They have been given the facility of the Export Earners Foreign Currency (EEFC) Account. At present, the total amount in these accounts is a modest Rs.2000 crore, I propose to expand the scope of the account by allowing the following facilities:</p>
<p>+ To open offices abroad and to meet the expenses thereof; and</p>
<p>+ To make investments from the balance in the account in overseas joint ventures upto the limit of U$$ 15 million, without reference to the RBI.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>* I also believe that the time has come for preparatory work towards capital account convertibility. This is a cherished goal. It is also a matter of great sensitivity. Hence, I shall not make any commitment. For the present, I am asking RBI to appoint a group of experts to lay out the road map towards capital account convertibility, prescribe the economic parameters which have to be achieved at each milestone and work out a detailed time table for achieving the goal. I believe the appointment of such a group will send a powerful signal to the world about our determination to join the ranks of front-line nations.</p>
<p>SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY:</p>
<p>* My last budget was viewed in certain quarters as science and technology-friendly. Flattery has its rewards, and I intend to strengthen my friendship with the scientific community. I propose to take the following initiatives;</p>
<p>+ The scheme to match every additional commercial rupee earned by CSIR and ICAR laboratories, as well as the IITs, will continue on a permanent basis.</p>
<p>+ The Technology Development Board, established to accelerate the commercialisation of indigenous technology has identified 16 projects that are commercially viable in the fields of agriculture, health, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. In 1996-97, I provided Rs.30 crore to the Technology Development Fund. I propose to increase the allocation in 1997-98 to Rs.70 crore.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>* Tomorrow's technology is based on today's science. I am concerned that there is declining interest in the learning of sciences in schools and colleges. I hold the view that an MBA - even if he is from Harvard - is not a patch on a scientist. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of our Independence, we will launch the &quot;Swarnajayanti&quot; fellowships. Outstanding scientists below the age of 45 will be assisted to attain and sustain world class levels in science. A sum of 500 million rupees in the Department of Education's budget will be used to create a corpus. The Minister of State for Science and Technology will announce the details of the science.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>* Closer linkages have to be developed between Indian industry and publicly-funded research laboratories. Hence, I propose to allow government-promoted societies recognised by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and notified under the Income Tax Act to invest in the equity of private sector companies. These institutions will invest not money but their knowledge and know-how as their equity.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY:</p>
<p>* If there is one science that will dominate the 21st century, it is information technology. If there is one industry in which India can emerge as a world leader, it is information technology. However, for this potential to be realised, we need a completely new policy for manufacturing and marketing IT products. The Electonic Hardware Technology Park (EHTP) Scheme, presently in force, gives limited flexibility. There is an imperative need to increase production volumes and attract foreign direct investment. Accordingly, it has been decided that EHTP/EOU/EPZ units in electronic hardware may be permitted to sell one half of the value of their products, during any 12 month period, in the domestic market will be on payment of excise duty equivalent to full customs duty, including the additional duty of customs. Details of the new unified manufacturing scheme will be incorporated in the new EXIM policy that will be effective from April 1, 1997.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>COMPANIES ACT AND DIRECT TAXES ACT:</p>
<p>* Hon'ble Members will recall that  I had set up an expert group to draft a new Companies Bill and another expert committee to prepare a new Direct Taxes Bill. Both groups have done splendid work and have submitted their reports. Copies of the reports will be placed in the Parliament Library next week. They will also be distributed widely. A working draft of each Bill will also be circulated as soon as it is ready. It is my hope that there will be wide and informed debate on this bill. It is my intention to bring the new Companies Bill before this House in the monsoon session and the New Direct Taxes Bill in the winter session.</p>
