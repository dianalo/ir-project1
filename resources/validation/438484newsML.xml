<headline>California Amplifier sees Q4 oper loss.</headline>
<dateline>CAMARILLO, Calif. 1997-03-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>California Amplifier Inc said on Thursday it expects to report an operating loss for its fourth quarter ended March 1, due to sharply lower sales.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement revenues for the fourth quarter were about $8.9 million compared to $18.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996. Sales for fiscal 1997 were about $49.2 million compared to $61.6 in the previous year.</p>
<p>The company said the lower sales will result in a fourth quarter operating loss when it reports its results on April 9.  </p>
<p>&quot;The fourth quarter sales continued to reflect the softness in sales of wireless cable and satellite television products,&quot; said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ira Coron.</p>
<p>Coron said that both the domestic and international markets showed softness. The company's domestic customers bought at lower levels than in the third quarter as the move to digital technologies caused them to review their analog expansion plans.</p>
<p>Despite the loss, the firm's cash position improved to $3.15 million mainly due to inventory and accounts receivable improvements.</p>
<p>The company said it expects sales in the first fiscal quarter of 1998 will better those of the fourth quarter because of anticipated shipments to certain international markets as well as initial sales of digital products to domestic operators.</p>
