<p>Dutch master Ruud Gullit said on Friday discontent in his Chelsea ranks would help the beat Wimbledon in Sunday's F.A. Cup semifinal.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes it is good to have confrontation before important matches and that is my way of doing things,&quot; Gullit said.</p>
<p>&quot;I did it with the Dutch national team and so did Johan Cruyff. Angry players often perform better, I know I did when I was criticised in Italy.</p>
<p>&quot;You want a reaction and I saw that in training today,&quot; Gullit said after Chelsea's last practice session before the most important match of their season. &quot;The players were really focused on the game which gives me great confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>Gullit has openly criticised his players in recent weeks after watching Chelsea crash to three consecutive league defeats.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night the players took over in the slanging match, blaming each other for conceding three second-half goals in 10 minutes in their 3-1 defeat at struggling Coventry.</p>
<p>Gullit also launched a verbal attack on Gianluca Vialli, who has been consigned to the bench for most of the season.</p>
<p>But on Friday he said he had spoken to the Italian, who assured his coach he wanted to stay at Stamford Bridge.</p>
<p>&quot;We spoke for about 10 minutes and said what we wanted to,&quot; Gullit said. &quot;He was hurt but that's what I expected...he loves it here and wants to stay which is good news for me as a coach.&quot;</p>
