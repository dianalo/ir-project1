<p>CBOT corn futures closed lower in a volatile weather market, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The weather basically has broken and it doesn't look like we'll have a problem,&quot; said Charlie Sernatinger, analyst for E.D. and F. Man International.</p>
<p>Weather Express Chief Forecaster Fred Gesser said a tropical storm developing in the U.S. Gulf could bring widespread rains next week to the dry areas of central and southern Illinois.</p>
<p>But there were some private forecasters who cut back on the amount of rain expected for the U.S. Midwest.</p>
<p>Dave Taylor, Weather Services Corp meteorologist said spotty showers may develop further south in the Midwest next week, but generally the area should be dry.</p>
<p>The U.S. crop is entering its key pollination or reproductive stage of development. The crop would benefit from warm and damp weather but could be harmed by hot and dry weather. Wednesday's National Weather Service six- to 10-day outlook was for below- to much-below-normal temperatures and normal- to above-normal rain in the Midwest from July 22-26.</p>
<p>Corn closed unchanged to 2-3/4 cents lower, with July down one at $2.65-1/2. September was down 2-3/4 at $2.47-1/4.  </p>
<p>Crop experts said the Illinois corn crop was beginning to show signs of heat and moisture stress but if moisture is received soon it would stem further deterioration of the crop.</p>
<p>&quot;In northwestern and south-central Illinois there's some serious (moisture) stress going on. Around Champaign and in southwestern Illinois the crop is proceeding into pollination and much of the soil water has been depleted. I think we're losing yield every day it doesn't rain, but we're not losing a lot of yield. It's high time for rain,&quot; said Emerson Nafziger, University of Illinois extension agronomist.</p>
<p>Wednesday's National Weather Service six- to 10-day outlook was for below to much below normal temperatures and normal to above normal rainfall in the U.S. Midwest from July 22 to July 26.</p>
<p>Some cash dealers reported increased farmer selling Thursday and cash basis markets were lower. Traders said USDA's weekly export sales report released early Thursday was bearish for nearby contracts and bullish for new crop contracts.</p>
<p>USDA said net export sales of U.S. old crop corn during the week ended July 10 totalled 263,900 tonnes, near the low end of expectations for 200,000 to 400,000 tonnes. Net export sales of new crop corn totalled 490,200 tonnes, near the high end of expectations for 300,000 to 500,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>In spread trading, Cargill Inc did three million bushels of September/July at 16-3/4 to 17 cents, E.D. and F. Man Interntional did 1.5 million September/December at 3/4 to one cent, premium December, and Merrill Lynch Futures spread one million bushels of September/December at 3/4 to one cent, premium December, traders said.</p>
<p>Cargill Inc bought four million bushels of December, Cargill Investor Services bought six million bushels of December, Continental Grain sold two million bushels of December and ABN Amro, The Chicago Corp sold two million bushels of December, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 78,000 contracts, above the 74,094 traded Wednesday.</p>
<p>In corn options, Lind Waldock bought 1,000 December $2.60 calls at 12-1/2 cents and sold 1,000 September $2.60 calls at 7-1/2 cents, traders said. Lind Waldock also bought 1,500 December $2.50 puts at 13 to 13-1/2 cents and Cargill Investor Services sold 1,000 December $2.30 puts at 5-1/4 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 30,000 contracts, below the 31,848 traded Wednesday.</p>
