<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>

<p>Dutch bonds closed 10 to 20 cents firmer but some dealers predicted that they would soon surrender some of their recent gains to profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices rose but volume was pretty light and it doesn't feel right to me. One strong figure would be enough to drive it back down again,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Several dealers noted that 10-year yields were again approaching the 6.20 percent level where they have previously encountered resistance.</p>
<p>Ten-year Dutch yields have not been significantly below this level since early February.  </p>
<p>But some players felt that idle stockpiles of cash could soon be set to work in the bond market, helping push yields back towards the six percent level.</p>
<p>&quot;You should not rule out a move to six percent because there is still a lot of cash waiting to be invested,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
