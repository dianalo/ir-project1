<p>European Union negotiators are close to agreement to make an existing accord on border-free travel part of the EU treaty, with opt-outs for Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>If successful, the deal would ensure the end of border controls within 13 of the EU's 15 countries and boost the bloc's efforts to create what it hopes will be a vast area of freedom and security.</p>
<p>The Schengen Agreement, named after the Luxembourg town in which it was signed, came into effect in March 1995. The pact calls for border controls between members to be removed and cooperation on police matters enhanced</p>
<p>Under a proposal submitted to treaty negotiators by the Dutch EU presidency late on Monday, Britain and Ireland would retain their borders but could participate in other Schengen activities such as sharing information on crime.</p>
<p>Officials said there were many details left to hammer out, notably over what role -- if any -- the European Commission and other institutions should have.</p>
<p>But they said the outline of an agreement that could be adopted at the EU's June summit in Amsterdam was now apparent.</p>
<p>&quot;Ireland and Britain will remain as islands,&quot; French European Affairs Ministers Michel Barnier said.</p>
<p>Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal are full members. Austria, Italy, Greece, Denmark, Finland and Sweden have signed but not yet fully implemented the pact.</p>
<p>Non-EU countries Norway and Iceland, which share a passport-free union with the EU's Nordic nations, have cooperation agreements under the pact.</p>
<p>Britain has long ruled out lifting its passport controls, arguing that because it is an island there is no benefit to it to open its borders. Ireland cannot join Schengen while it retains open borders with Britain.</p>
<p>Officials said Doug Henderson, Britain's new minister for Europe, had told his fellow treaty negotiators that the new Labour government would cooperate on incorporating Schengen into the EU, providing Britain's position was safeguarded.</p>
<p>Making Schengen part of the EU is seen in a number of European capitals as a key element in the bloc's integration, including the eventual sharing of immigration and visa policy.</p>
<p>It is also seen as a test case for the the concept of &quot;flexibility&quot; in which the EU would incorporate in its treaty the right of some countries to integrate, without others if necessary.</p>
