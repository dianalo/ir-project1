<p>- Mozambique's National Tourist Board says it has received proposals for investment of more than $140 million in tourism projects since the beginning of last year. The industry has been picking up since a civil war ended in 1992 and the board estimates that 500,000 tourists visited the country in 1996.</p>
<p>- A judge in the Mozambican port city of Beira has ordered the release of 31 people who were arrested over the last fortnight while taking part in anti-government demonstrations organised by the opposition Renamo party. But the judge said they will still have to appear in court to establish whether they broke the law.</p>
