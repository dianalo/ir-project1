<p>Europe's divisions over which countries will qualify for a single European currency burst into the open on Wednesday amid reports that a plan was being prepared to let Italy miss out gracefully on becoming a founder member.</p>
<p>London's Financial Times newspaper reported that under the plan Italy would be allowed to join economic and monetary union (EMU) in 2000 or 2001, but not in 1999 when banks begin using the new euro currency.</p>
<p>Rome could be given sweeteners such as a seat on the new European Central Bank, the report suggested.</p>
<p>European Union officials confirmed privately the idea of delaying Italy's entry into the next century was being considered by several governments.</p>
<p>But official denials came fast and furious.</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi angrily dismissed any idea that his country would not be in the first wave of a single currency, a matter of intense pride for Italy, a founder member of the EU and a Group of Seven nation.</p>
<p>&quot;The Italian government...deplores the constant repetition of false stories and unjustified statements, including from authoritative media, which have no foundation whatsoever,&quot; a statement from Prodi's office said.</p>
<p>Prodi's foreign minister, Lamberto Dini, said he excluded any plan to keep Italy and other Mediterranean economies out when a hard core group melds its currencies.</p>
<p>Portugal and Spain also insisted they would be in the first round.</p>
<p>&quot;We are certain Spain is going to be where it should be, in the first wave of countries which constitute the European Monetary Union in the agreed timetable,&quot; Spanish Economy Secretary Cristobal Montoro said.</p>
<p>The European Commission, which will provide early in 1998 the data that will determine which country qualifies for EMU, repeated its mantra that the economic criteria contained in the EU's Maastricht Treaty was the only measure that would count.</p>
<p>&quot;The treaty, the whole treaty and nothing but the treaty,&quot; a Commission spokesman said.</p>
<p>Finance ministers from likely hard core countries took the same line.</p>
<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who takes a tough line on which countries should be allowed in, said he knew of no plan to exclude Italy.</p>
<p>Asked in Bonn whether Italy would be in the first group, Waigel said: &quot;That depends on the criteria.&quot;</p>
<p>In Brussels, Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm, another hardliner, said any country that met the requirements laid out in Maastricht would be let in.</p>
<p>&quot;Member states that fulfil all of the five criteria...have to be allowed to join,&quot; said Zalm, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency.</p>
<p>To qualify for the single currency, countries must meet tough standards on inflation, debt, deficits, interest rates and exchange rates.</p>
<p>Reaction on financial markets was mixed.</p>
<p>The lira weakened against the German mark in the morning, but rebounded later. Italian and Spanish markets shrugged off the report once the denials started coming in.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is saying what they're supposed to say and as long as they continue to do so the markets won't be shaken,&quot; said Alfredo Urrutia, chief economist at Societe Generale in Madrid.</p>
<p>The report nonetheless underlined the political dilemma facing Europe as it tries to get its finances in order for monetary union.</p>
<p>Germany and the Netherlands are adamant that they will not allow the criteria to be fudged in order to allow the bloc's southern tier countries to get in on the first wave.</p>
<p>Such a move is seen as an invitation for markets to attack the new currency. But saying publicly that a country should not be allowed in triggers intense anger.</p>
<p>A report in 1995 that Germany's Waigel had told a parliamentary group that Italy was unlikely to qualify for the euro triggered outrage in Italy, prompting diplomatic smooth talk from Bonn.</p>
<p>In January, at the beginning of the Dutch presidency, comments by Zalm that some countries should take their time trying to qualify set off a similar reaction.</p>
<p>The division had led to speculation even before Wednesday's report that a way must be found to let in the weaker economies without undermining the stronger ones.</p>
