<p>Turkey's prime minister, Necmettin Erbakan said on Sunday the Turkish army's 25-day-old operation in northern Iraq was coming to an end, state-run Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;Erbakan said the operation in northern Iraq was coming to an end,&quot; the agency said, quoting Erbakan who was speaking at a party meeting in Ankara.</p>
<p>Thousands of Turkish troops, backed by air power, poured into northern Iraq on May 14 in a cross-border operation against Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) bases used for raids into southeast Turkey.</p>
<p>The operation has attracted condemnation from the Arab League secretariat and a demand that Turkish forces withdraw immediately. Some of NATO-member Turkey's Western allies and the United Nations secretary-general have criticised the operation.</p>
<p>Turkey admitted on Friday that Kurdish rebels had used sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles to shoot down two army helicopters on a mission in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>The Turkish military say they have killed 2,252 guerrillas in the operation for the loss of 95 of their own troops. The rebels put losses by the army and its Iraqi Kurd allies at almost 800 men.</p>
<p>A military spokesman said on Friday that the army had asked the government for funding for the Iraq operation, but had received no answer.</p>
<p>Erbakan said the government would supply the army with the necessary funds, Anatolian said.</p>
<p>More than 24,000 people have died in the 12-year struggle between Turkish security forces and the PKK who are fighting for independence or autonomy in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey.</p>
