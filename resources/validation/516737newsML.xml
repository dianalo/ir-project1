<p>IPE Brent crude futures touched a session high in mid-afternoon trade after NYMEX products futures held key support levels, brokers said.</p>
<p>June Brent was trading nine cents up at $17.90 a barrel at 1446 GMT, having hit a high of $17.91.</p>
<p>&quot;Every time the market drifts off to important support levels, particularly on U.S. products, it seems to recover,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Traders said that investment funds were quite aggressive sellers but there had been no follow through from trade players.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was no follow-through on the selling so a bit of short-covering came in,&quot; a broker said. &quot;The locals have run it up in the States.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers GNI said that heating oil demand in the U.S. Northeast would rise for the next few days due to cold weather conditions, the worst of which is expected to last until Saturday.</p>
<p>NYMEX heating oil came off a low of 53.20 cents a gallon to 54.15 cents a gallon, 0.62 cents up on the day, while unleaded gasoline mostly retraced early losses despite Wednesday's bearish stock data.</p>
