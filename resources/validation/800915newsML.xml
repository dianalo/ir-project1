<p>Sydney Harbour Casino Ltd expected to announce within days a syndicated bank debt facility worth about A$800 million through the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to refinance its existing credit lines, chairman Dick Warburton said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're actually refinancing the whole facility which I recall was about A$800 million and it's about the same this time,&quot; Warburton told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have made the decision and we're in the process of finalising the details,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will still be with the Commonwealth Bank,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the announcement) will be probably within days rather than weeks.&quot;  </p>
<p>Warburton said he expected refinancing would help cut costs in the second half of the current calendar 1997 financial year.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect that (interest expense) to drop off a bit in the second half as the debt is refinanced,&quot; Warburton said.</p>
<p>Sydney Harbour Casino wanted to take advantage of the more attractive climate for borrowing, he said.</p>
<p>The casino's non-current borrowings rose to A$484.87 million in the six months to June 30 from A$334.80 million at December 31, 1996 and A$200.50 million at June 30, 1996.</p>
<p>The borrowings have risen as the Casino builds its permanent Star City site, expected to cost at total A$876 million.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, Sydney Harbour Casino announced a A$7.34 million net loss in the six months to June 30, due to an abnormal loss before tax of A$42.99 million.</p>
<p>The abnormal loss was linked to set-up costs for the Star City site which the Sydney Harbour Casino will move into in December. Operating profit before abnormals and taxes fell to A$32.45 million from A$33.80 million a year earlier, despite an 11.1 percent rise in revenues to A$201.57 million.</p>
<p>Earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and abnormals (EDITDA) rose to A$47.3 million from A$47 million as labour costs rose to cope with an expansion in patronage.  </p>
<p>Warburton said revenues and earnings were unlikely to rise much from this level in the second half because the Casino's current temporary site had reached capacity limits.</p>
<p>He said, however, that the casino's expected move to the new Star City site would boost revenues, particularly in December.</p>
<p>&quot;One should expect a pretty substantial boost, but the real effect will be in the second half of next year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Warburton said Sydney Casino expected daily attendances to rise to about 25,000 a day from its current 15,000 a day once it moved into the new site.  </p>
<p>The hype surrounding the launch of Star City and the initial Christmas period may see higher daily attendances in the first month of operation, December. U.S. casino operator Showboat Inc has a 25 percent stake in Sydney Harbour Casino and owns the management rights for the casino.</p>
<p>Australian media mogul Kerry Packer and his Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd had an option to buy 10 percent of Sydney Harbour Casino and 85 percent of the management contract from Showboat. But he cancelled the deal in May because of difficulties with the Casino Control Authority here.</p>
<p>Sydney Harbour did not declare a dividend.  </p>
<p>Its shares closed down two cents to A$1.92 on Thursday.</p>
