<p>The California Medical Association Wednesday backed a bill allocating $6 million for research of the medical benefits of marijuana and the best ways to administer and distribute it.</p>
<p>The group, which represents 34,000 doctors in the state, had not backed Proposition 215, the &quot;medical marinjana&quot; initiative, which voters approved last fall. But it said it could change its view if research confirmed that smoking pot had medicinal benefits.</p>
<p>The research bill was authored by California Sentator John Vasconcellos, a Democrat. It was expected to go to a Senate vote in early June.</p>
<p>Despite anecdotal evidence that marijuana brings relief to people suffering from AIDS, cancer, glaucoma and other illnesses, there is no conclusive data showing it is safe and effective.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been no controlled studies,&quot; a spokesman for the California Medical Association said Wednesday. &quot;That is what we have been pushing for.&quot;</p>
<p>He said one particular question was whether inhaling marijuana brings different benefits than ingesting it. Opponents of the medical marijuana movement argue that doctors can prescribe a pill form of the drug as a substitute for smoking pot.</p>
<p>Under the medical marijuana initiative that voters approved last fall, doctors who recommend marijuana as a medical treatment and their patients who smoke it are supposed to be protected from prosecution.</p>
<p>The measure has led to the formation of so-called cannibas buying clubs throughout the state, set up to insure the safe distribution of marijuana to people with medical needs. But lawmakers opposed the measure and complained it conflicted with federal drug laws.</p>
