<p>Oman said on Monday Israel's current policies damaged previous rapprochement between the two states and ruled out normal ties with Arab countries.</p>
<p>&quot;If Israel continues with its current policies which contradict agreements with the Palestinians and deviate from the peace process...it will necessarily have a big impact on all past achievements between Oman and Israel,&quot; Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah said.</p>
<p>Oman and Qatar have gone further than all other Gulf Arab states to establish ties with Israel, which has set up trade offices in both countries.</p>
<p>But Oman said in early December that it had frozen ties with Israel. Qatar put its contacts with Israel on ice in September.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel cannot have normal relations with us or with other Arabs as long as it continues its occupation and settlement of Arab territory,&quot; Abdullah told reporters.</p>
<p>Arabs have criticised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for its decision to grant financial benefits to Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank and its failure to implement an agreement to withdraw its forces from the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>Asked how the freezing of ties would affect Israel's trade office in Muscat, Abdullah said: &quot;If the Israeli position remains as it is then I believe the man in the street or the Omani businessman will not accept contacts with Israel.&quot;</p>
