<p>Sweden's largest bank, Handelsbanken, said on Tuesday its takeover of Stadshypotek had created more business with new customers than it had expected.</p>
<p>The bank posted a 26 percent rise in operating profit for the first half of the year to 3.78 billion crowns, which was slightly higher than market expectations of 3.66 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Handelsbanken said margins between lending and deposit interest rates, excluding Stadshypotek, were largely unchanged in the first six months.  </p>
<p>Net interest income rose 18 percent to 5.39 billion crowns on the back of increased lending volumes following Handelsbanken's acquisition of Stadshypotek for 22.9 billion crowns earlier this year.</p>
<p>Net commission income advanced 11 percent to 1.58 billion crowns, mainly helped by increased volumes for fund management and securities trading.</p>
<p>Loan losses plummeted 75 percent to 234 million crowns or 0.1 percent of lending, down from 0.6 percent.</p>
<p>The net result of financial transactions dropped to 233 million crowns from 795 million as a result of lower earnings on interest trading operations.</p>
<p>Costs rose 19 percent to 3.65 billion crowns, of which 13 percentage points were attributable to the acquisition of Stadshypotek.</p>
<p>&quot;The remaining part of the increase is due to higher systems development costs, setting up new branches in the Nordic countries and also to exchange rate changes,&quot; Handelsbanken said in a statement.</p>
<p>Swedish retail banking operations had unchanged expenses, it said.</p>
<p>The work of integrating Stadshypotek has continued, with loans being transferred between Stadhypotek, Handelsbanken Hypotek and the bank. Stadshypotek's other banking business had also been moved to Handelsbanken.</p>
<p>&quot;This extra business with new customers has been much greater than expected, and during the second quarter the increase in the volume of bank loans has therefore compensated for an anticipated fall in mortgage loans,&quot; the bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;This implies that the group's share of the total Swedish lending market was more or less unchanged during the second quarter at 30.4 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>The Handelsbanken share came off intra-day highs of 254 crowns after the report, and was trading three crowns up at 250.5 crowns at 0940 GMT.</p>
