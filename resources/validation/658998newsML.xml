<title>ROMANIA: Romania leu dips in overliquid money market.</title>
<headline>Romania leu dips in overliquid money market.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1997-06-13</dateline>

<p>The Romanian leu currency ended weaker at 7,240/280 to the dollar from about 7,205/250 in early trading but recovering from a mid-day low of 7,300/400, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>Dealers said a cash-heavy money market put the leu under pressure. They said a large dollar buying order quickened the leu's downswing at noon before a slight recovery at close.</p>
<p>&quot;High leu liquidity in early trading affected the currency,&quot; said a trader with a large state bank. &quot;Dollar supply was lower than on previous days.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the leu's short-term trend depended on the central bank's (BNR) moves to drain the currency, as well as on the level of hard currency supply. They saw that supply on the rise amid growing foreign interest in Romanian capital markets.</p>
<p>Short-term money market rates hovered at about 38 percent, with most banks seeking a good placement for their funds as the BNR stayed away from the market, operators said.</p>
<p>&quot;There were large dollar inflows earlier this week which prompted the BNR to purchase them and keep exports attractive,&quot; said another trader. &quot;This boosted leu liquidity.&quot;</p>
<p>Most operators said an auction for rollover treasury bills next week was unlikely to soak up excess lei from the market and urged the BNR to implement new tools to regulate the flows.</p>
<p>&quot;A way to solve overliquidity is badly needed,&quot; said one trader, adding that the BNR could either raise rates on minimum reserves or ask banks to hold those reserves only in the leu.</p>
<p>Commercial banks have now a choice on their minimum reserves, which they can hold in lei or in hard currency.</p>
<p>Dealers said licensed money changing bureaux also had hard currency in excess and were actively throwing it into the market. Leu-dollar retail prices bobbed at 7,140/250 on Friday, weaker than 7,000/100 earlier in the week.</p>
