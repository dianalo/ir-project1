<headline>NZ sends back 33 Thais deemed illegal workers.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1997-05-16</dateline>

<p>New Zealand's Immigration Service on Friday sent back a group of 33 Thais believed to be trying to enter the country to seek work, officials said.</p>
<p>The seven women and 26 men arrived at Wellington airport together on a flight from Bangkok via Sydney, Australia, on Thursday afternoon but were stopped by immigration officers.</p>
<p>&quot;It became clear they were not genuine visitors, and the Immigration Service believed they were planning to work illegally in New Zealand,&quot; immigration spokeswoman Ann Howarth told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is believed to be the largest group (of any nationality) turned back,&quot; she said, adding that so far this year about 230 Thais had been refused entry.</p>
<p>Data for other nationalities was not immediately available, but Howarth said such occurences &quot;happen every day -- though not usually in such large numbers&quot;.</p>
<p>Under New Zealand's entry rules, citizens of about 30 countries do not need to have a visa if they intend to only make a short visit. Thai nationals do not need to apply for a visa and are issued visitor permits on arrival.</p>
<p>The group of Thais was moved to the larger Auckland airport and, after spending the night in the terminal there, left on a direct flight back to Thailand without incident, Howarth said.</p>
