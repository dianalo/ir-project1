<p>Military ruler Pierre Buyoya has said parties to Burundi's crisis will meet for negotiations in Tanzania in August and he hoped all Hutu armed factions would attend.</p>
<p>Buyoya, a retired army major who seized power in a coup on July 25 last year, told reporters on Tuesday night negotiations would start in August in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to be present with the political parties and hopefully all the armed factions as well,&quot; said Buyoya, but he added that some parties had certain conditions for attending.</p>
<p>He said talks would be chaired by African elder statesman Julius Nyerere, a former Tanzanian president and the international mediator trying to end Burundi's civil war and political crisis.</p>
<p>Buyoya said his government had opened secret talks with the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), the political wing of the largest Hutu rebel movement, and in March in Rome they signed an agreement for the basis of negotiations.</p>
<p>Buyoya dismissed as inaccurate a report last week from the London-based human rights group Amnesty International that Burundi's mainly Tutsi army had forced majority Hutu civilians into &quot;regroupment&quot; camps, leading to massacres of hundreds.</p>
<p>&quot;People were regrouped because of security and only because of security. This is only a temporary solution...When I read the Amnesty report I got the impression the whole country had been regrouped,&quot; Buyoya said.</p>
<p>Amnesty said estimates of the number of people confined to regroupment camps in Burundi were between 350,000 and 500,000.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 people have been killed in massacres and civil war pitting the Tutsi-dominated army against Hutu rebels since the killing of Burundi's first Hutu president in 1993.</p>
