<headline>NBA basketball-HEAT BEAT THE KNICKS TO FORCE SEVENTH GAME.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tim Hardaway and Dan Majerle combined for 16 points in an 18-7 fourth-quarter run to lead the Miami Heat to a 95-90 victory over the New York Knicks on Friday and to force a seventh game in their Eastern Conference semifinal series.</p>
<p>Game Seven will be Sunday in Miami. The winner will play the Chicago Bulls in the East finals.</p>
<p>Six players were suspended for Friday's game after a brawl in Wednesday's game in Miami.</p>
<p>The Heat played without starting power forward P.J. Brown, who will also miss Game Seven.</p>
<p>The Knicks were without their top two scorers -- Patrick Ewing and Allan Houston -- and reserve point guard Charlie Ward for Game Six. New York will be without starting forward Larry Johnson and guard John Starks for Game Seven.</p>
<p>Alonzo Mourning led Miami with 28 points and nine rebounds. Hardaway had 20 points and Majerle finished with 18.</p>
<p>Chris Childs led the Knicks with 22 points and Johnson added 20.</p>
<p>Despite the absence of Ewing, Houston and Ward, the Knicks led by as many as 10 points after the first quarter and led 44-40 at halftime.</p>
<p>Miami tied the game, 64-64, on a three-point play by Isaac Austin with 51 seconds left in the third quarter and took the lead, 68-67, on a dunk by Jamal Mashburn with 9:36 remaining in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>But Johnson converted a three-point play and Charles Oakley hit a corner jumper to give New York a 72-68 advantage.</p>
<p>Hardaway then started the decisive 18-7 run with a three-pointer with 7:12 left.</p>
