<title>SINGAPORE: Thailand's PTT ceases refinery talks with Kuwait.</title>
<headline>Thailand's PTT ceases refinery talks with Kuwait.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1996-10-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Thailand's state-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) is seeking other partners for its proposed 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) refinery project, Adul Leelapatranurak, PTT's executive director for refining, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>PTT has been holding talks with Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC for several years over building the refinery by 2002, but Leelapatranurak said bilateral discussions were on hold.</p>
<p>&quot;Talks have stopped for the moment,&quot; he said, in an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of a downstream energy conference in Singapore.  </p>
<p>He did not specify if the two sides had differing views on the future of the project. However, he said there were a number of issues to be considered before the project could go ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;The southern seaboard export-orientated refinery is a big investment project. We must make sure of the finances and the commitment to offtake and export the product,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the feasibility of the project would depend on refining profits, which currently were under pressure.  </p>
<p>&quot;If margins remain less than $6 (per barrel), I believe no new refinery will come onstream because the banks are very sticky (about) financing the new refinery, especially in the situation of the imbalance of supply and demand. The banks also need to see the margins and also see the commitment of the refinery to have the top operation rate of the refinery,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Margins were currently as low as $4 a barrel, short of the $6 needed to break even, he told Reuters.  </p>
<p>It estimated Thailand's would show a deficit of 23,360 bpd of naphtha and natural gas, 23,300 bpd of diesel and 23,200 bpd of fuel oil by next year.</p>
<p>&quot;If one or more of the three refineries that are on the drawing table today is actually built, the product surplus will be aggravated,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Two local companies plan to enter Thailand's refining sector.</p>
<p>Thai Petrochemical Industry Plc (TPI) proposes to build a 300,000 bpd refinery by 1999 while Sukhothai Petroleum Co Ltd a 125,000 bpd refinery by 2004.  </p>
<p>Thailand's refining capacity was boosted to 760,000 bpd when the new 145,000 bpd Rayong refinery and 130,000 bpd Star Petroleum refinery started commercial production in mid-1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Refinery production slates (in 1997) will not be balanced with demand, resulting in surpluses of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and gasoline while imports of middle distillates and fuel oil will continue,&quot; Leelapatranurak said.</p>
<p>He estimated Thailand would have a surplus of 22,600 bpd of gasoline, 13,770 bpd of LPG and 2,490 bpd of kerosene/jet fuel by next year.  </p>
<p>If the various projects go ahead, Thailand would have a deficit in diesel of 81,700 bpd while the rest of the products would be in excess - gasoline 57,790 bpd, fuel oil 29,060 bpd, naphtha/natural gas liquids 27,260 bpd and kerosene/jet fuel 25,280 bpd, Leelapatranurak.</p>
<p>&quot;Margins are quite low than expected before,&quot; he said. &quot;One thing we have to do, the most urgent, is the refinance of the company in order to solve the short term financial situation.&quot;</p>
<p>PTT is planning to become a public company by the end of this year and seek a listing on the Thai stock exchange by the end of 1998.  </p>
