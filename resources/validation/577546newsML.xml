<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian dollar swept aside by resurgent yen.</title>
<headline>Australian dollar swept aside by resurgent yen.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-05-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian dollar drifted sideways against its U.S. counterpart Monday but the calm belied wild conditions on the crosses where the currency was hammered by the yen before making a desperate, last-minute bounce.</p>
<p>The day was dominated by an on-going seachange in sentiment over the U.S. dollar which saw it extend last week's already scary slide to four month lows under 118.00 yen. Such was the speed of the decline Japanese officials, perhaps alarmed by the effectiveness of their latest verbal assault, called for calm.</p>
<p>Both dollars steadied as a result, but traders reckoned the aftershocks could well overshadow Tuesday's Australian budget.  </p>
<p>By 4.45 pm (0645 GMT) the dollar was keeping its head down at US$0.7775/80 having drifted up from an early US$0.7759/64, but was still short of Friday's late US$0.7782/87.</p>
<p>Immediate support had appeared at US$0.7755, with further chart bulwarks put at US$0.7735 and US$0.7720, while resistance was expected at US$0.7795 and US$0.7810, with last week's US$0.7860 peak looking a distant target now.</p>
<p>Likely trading ranges were far harder to assess on the crosses where the currency had plunged from more than 99.00 yen this time last week to a four month low of 91.30 at one point this morning.  </p>
<p>The local currency had managed to clamber back to 92.41/51 yen by the close, but remained far short of Friday's late 95.64/74 and hostage to the uncertain fortunes of US$/yen.</p>
<p>Traders were greeted by a deluge of sell orders on US$/yen this morning from Japanese investors spooked by talk of G3 intervention and narrowing interest differentials between Japan and the U.S. In this they were just following the cue of U.S. hedge funds which had wiped two yen off the dollar Friday to leave it at 120.20 in New York.</p>
<p>Today's early selling saw it dive almost another three yen to a 117.50 low, a drop which even unsettled Japanese officials.  </p>
<p>That desire should have been reinforced by today's muted domestic economic data which showed housing finance commitments fell 1.3 percent in March when a 1.0 percent rise had been expected. It was balanced somewhat by a 1.5 percent rise in the value of commitments which remained at historically high levels.</p>
<p>Manufacturing output price figures confirmed the lack of inflationary pressure in the economy by falling 0.1 percent in March, the first drop since June last year, on the back of a drop in car and petrol prices.</p>
<p>Analysts also expected Tuesday's Federal Budget to take some of the pressure off monetary policy.  </p>
<p>Median expectations are the government will cut between A$1.5-2.0 billion from the budget deficit for 1997/98 leaving a shortfall of around A$2.0 billion.</p>
<p>The headline balance will be well in surplus, perhaps by as much as A$10 billion, thanks to privatisation receipts so the government will have no net need to issue bonds that year.</p>
<p>Further out, analysts expect the Treasurer to forecast a balanced underlying budget for 1998/98 or maybe even a small surplus. Such an outcome would also take Australia a step closer to earning a credit upgrade from ratings agencies like S&amp;P and Moody's, they added. -- Wayne Cole 61-2 9373 1800</p>
