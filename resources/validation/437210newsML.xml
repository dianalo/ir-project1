<p>Sri Lanka has issued emergency orders cracking down on illegal video parlours which it said offended public morality and corrupted schoolchildren.</p>
<p>A government statement on Wednesday said the government had increased penalties against video parlours which showed pornographic films.</p>
<p>And anyone found running one was liable to a fine of 100,000 rupees ($1,750) or a jail term of between two and 10 years, or both.</p>
<p>Until now, running a video parlour without a licence carried a fine of up to 1,000 rupees and a jail term of no more than six months.</p>
<p>&quot;These video parlours have become notorious for pornographic films which tend to attract not only the adolescents but at times even schoolchildren,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>It said the government had also decided to close down illegal gambling centres.</p>
<p>Police had already arrested 130 people and closed down 25 video parlours and 79 gambling centres in and around Colombo under the new rules, the statement said.</p>
