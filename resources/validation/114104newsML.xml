<title>MEXICO: Half a cheer for Mexico's petrochemical retreat.</title>
<headline>Half a cheer for Mexico's petrochemical retreat.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1996-10-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexico's retreat on the privatization of state oil monopoly Pemex's secondary petrochemical units drew half a cheer Monday from traders and analysts, who said it was not clear the government would find any takers for a minority stake.</p>
<p>The Energy Ministry announced Sunday that instead of an outright sale of its petrochemical plants to foreign and Mexican firms it would create a series of subsidiaries, maintain a 51 percent stake in them and offer the remainder to private investors.  </p>
<p>The move was widely seen as a compromise between the government's initial privatization plans -- backed by the United States and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) -- and the strong nationalist opposition from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the leftist Democratic Revolution Party (PRD).</p>
<p>But it also raised questions about whether Pemex can raise enough capital through offering minority stakes, said Luis Acevedo, a columnist for El Financiero newspaper.  </p>
<p>Acevedo said Pemex hoped to generate $5 billion from the petrochemical sales, a figure he called &quot;without foundation&quot; and moreover &quot;a very small quantity for such a complex industry.&quot;</p>
<p>In a rare show of support for the government, the conservative National Action Party (PAN) backed the plan as a means to generate the capital needed to improve the largely outdated petrochemical technology in Mexico.</p>
<p>One PAN legislator said her party is likely to give the new plan a chance -- though the government's large majority in Congress means opposition opinions are largely irrelevant to legislative decisions.  </p>
<p>&quot;In some form or other, (the new strategy) is strengthening these plants that are in poor conditions,&quot; PAN congresswoman Teresa Gomez Mont told Reuters. &quot;This is not too far divorced from what the PAN has proposed.&quot;</p>
<p>But the representative of one company that had planned to bid on petrochemical businesses told a Mexico City newspaper he was unimpressed with the government's plan.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't go just half-way, so we'll have to move forward in other areas (of privatization) like railroads,&quot; Roberto Rodriguez Puente, director of operations for Grupo Cydsa, told Reforma newspaper.  </p>
<p>&quot;With a (private) participation of only 49 percent, we'd have to think twice about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Reforma's main headline called the decision a &quot;retreat&quot; while its economic columnist Enrique Quintana said the new rules must allow stockholders to impose conditions on the use of their capital in order for the plan to work.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be necessary for Pemex to define clearly the mechanisms,&quot; Quintana said. &quot;If not, it is unlikely that anyone would accept the commitment of their capital in this partnership.&quot;  </p>
<p>One Mexico City-based economist, however, thought the compromise was at least a step forward.</p>
<p>&quot;It's better than nothing, which is what people were expecting, at least until after the (congressional) elections next year,&quot; Ann Ginsberg, an economist at Valores Finamex, told Reuters. &quot;It's the best they could do because of the difficult political situation they were in,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>One Mexican equities trader said he expected the stock issue to be well-received by investors in general but doubted whether the companies interested in buying some of the petrochemical businesses would be interested in the new stock.</p>
<p>&quot;There are similar precedents from other countries, so I think it could be well-accepted,&quot; the trader said. &quot;But everything depends on the terms of the issue.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokesman for one company that planned to bid on part of the petrochemical business said his firm would wait for the terms of the stock issue before commenting publicly.</p>
