<p>Hedda Nussbaum, whose former live-in lover Joel Steinberg fatally beat their illegally adopted daughter in a notorious case of child abuse almost a decade ago, has won the right to sue him for physical and psychological injuries, her attorney said Monday.</p>
<p>The decision by a special court referee suspends New York State's one-year statute of limitations for assault and the intentional infliction of emotional distress, said her attorney Betty Levinson.</p>
<p>&quot;I could not be more thrilled and gratified at the decision handed down ... which gives me the right to sue Joel Steinberg for the torture he inflicted on me from 1978 to 1987,&quot; said Nussbaum, whose face still bears the dramatic scars of battering despite extensive plastic surgery.</p>
<p>During Steinberg's highly publicised trial in 1989, pictures of Nussbaum's bruised face and broken nose as well as those of wide-eyed, 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg became a familiar and poignant sight in newspapers and on television broadcasts around the world.</p>
<p>Nussbaum, who now lives in obscurity outside New York City, appeared at a news conference on the steps of Manhattan Supreme Court to announce the legal decision that permits her to proceed with a case against Steinberg for monetary damages.</p>
<p>The decision was handed down Thursday by Steven Liebman, a referee for the New York State Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Steinberg, a lawyer, was found guilty of first-degree manslaughter in January 1989 of beating his illegally adopted daughter, Lisa, to death and is in prison. The case drew widespread attention to the issue of child abuse and battered women.</p>
<p>Lisa Steinberg was found on the bathroom floor of the family's filthy Greenwich Village apartment Nov. 1, 1987, after Nussbaum called police and told them the child had stopped breathing. Lisa died two days later.</p>
<p>Court testimony revealed Steinberg brutally beat the child and then went out to dinner without calling for medical help.</p>
<p>Another illegally adopted child, Mitchell, then 17 months old, was found unharmed but tethered to a chair and wallowing in excrement. He was returned to his biological mother.</p>
<p>Charges against Nussbaum were dropped after she agreed to testify against Steinberg.</p>
<p>A former children's book editor, Nussbaum said she now works with a support group for battered women and is writing a book about abuse to tell children how to find help.</p>
