<p>The main Conservative opposition party on Wednesday demanded the resignation of Lord David Simon, minister for trade and competitiveness in Europe and former chairman of British Petroleum Plc, because of an alleged conflict of interest.</p>
<p>John Redwood, the Conservatives' trade and industry spokesman, said he had evidence that Simon had approved a European Union action plan that covered four areas that directly affect BP, including liberalisation of the EU gas market.</p>
<p>Redwood told reporters this put Simon in breach of procedures for ministers and said he should resign. &quot;It's a disgrace... The only decent thing that can happen now is that he should resign.&quot;</p>
<p>The Department of Trade and Industry had no immediate comment on Redwood's complaint, but ministers have said arrangements are in place to ensure Simon will not be involved in any matters concerning BP.</p>
<p>But Redwood was dismissive of this explanation and said the DTI's assurances that no conflict of interest can arise were flimsy and lacked credibility.</p>
<p>&quot;If gas liberalisation doesn't have anything to do with BP, I'm a Dutchman,&quot; the former cabinet minister and Conservative leadership challenger said.</p>
<p>Redwood said he intended to keep up pressure on Simon and predicted the affair would do grave damage to the government's credibility.</p>
<p>But an aide to Prime Minister Tony Blair was dismissive of the challenge, saying Simon's willingness to give up a big salary at BP to work as an unpaid minister spoke volumes for the government's pro-business credentials.</p>
