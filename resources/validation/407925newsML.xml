<p>Swiss hopes of repairing the country's battered image after months of fueding with world Jewish groups could be put in jeopardy by far-right threats to seek a national referendum on whether Berne should pay into a Holocaust survivors fund.</p>
<p>Political analysts agreed on Thursday there was potential for a &quot;no&quot; vote based on a deep-seated Swiss mistrust of the outside world.</p>
<p>But they questioned whether rightist politicians were willing to be stamped as anti-semitic for campaigning against Berne contributing to the fund, which is starting on March 1 with bank donations.</p>
<p>At issue is a threat by Christoph Blocher, an industrialist and right-wing member of parliament, to call a referendum if the federal government contributes to the aid fund for impoverished Holocaust survivors.</p>
<p>&quot;Blocher wants to make use of the fact that a big part of the population is fed up with the Holocaust debate and that many people are annoyed by the accusations of someone like U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato,&quot; the newspaper Berner Zeitung commented.</p>
<p>World Jewish groups and other critics, including New York Republican D'Amato, have accused Swiss banks of sitting on accounts left by victims of Nazi genocide and the country as a whole of profiting cynically from its neutral status in World War Two.</p>
<p>Berne politicians say the government is wary of a popular backlash that could sink its effort to restore Switzerland's tarnished humanitarian image by having the government join in the financial goodwill gesture.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be more than a catastrophe,&quot; one official close to the government's damage control efforts said.</p>
<p>Blocher made his threat on Wednesday, the same day the cabinet agreed to administer the Holocaust fund as a gesture of atonement after months of mounting conflict with the World Jewish Congress (WJC) that threatened to damage Switzerland's key banking sector.</p>
<p>The fund will start with 100 million Swiss francs ($68 million) donated by the three biggest Swiss banks and is expected to grow with more corporate donations, but Berne has delayed a decision on joining while it grooms broad political support for the step.</p>
<p>&quot;When the issue is taxpayers' money for foreign organisations, it is very hard to get support in a referendum,&quot; Hans Hirter of the Institute for Political Science in Berne said.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, and this is what militates against a referendum, the right-wing and conservatives have reservations about a campaign against the fund because it could be stamped as anti-Jewish,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Zurich daily Tages-Anzeiger, on the biggest Swiss papers, brushed aside concern about a ballot box defeat and challenged rightists to seek a show-down.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that a clear majority of the people would decide in favour of a well organised foundation for Holocaust victims,&quot; it wrote.</p>
<p>Still, Hirter noted the federal government has been hit by popular rejection of many of its major policy initiatives in referendums in the past decade.</p>
<p>Swiss voters in 1986 rejected joining the United Nations, cancelled plans in 1992 to join the European Economic Area free-trade zone and in 1994 blocked a Swiss &quot;blue helmet&quot; U.N. peacekeeping role.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Swiss voters in 1994 also approved a government plan to introduce a law against racism.</p>
<p>Under Swiss direct democracy, a binding referendum can be forced by gathering 50,000 signatures.</p>
<p>Blocher, from the Swiss People's Party (SVP) that is on the far right of Berne's four-party centre-right coalition government, was a leader of the campaigns against U.N. and EU ties.</p>
