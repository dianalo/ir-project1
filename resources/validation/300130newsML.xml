<p>U.S. West Coast crude prices ended lower on Thursday, as flat differentials forced local trade to follow a weaker WTI market, traders said.</p>
<p>The discount for Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude has tightened over the last three deals, traders said. A key refiner continued to hold out for February barrels, but declined to give a bid.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ANS prices fell 15 cents from Wednesday to $24.67/24.87 a barrel.</p>
<p>With several refiners supplied for February, the low volume market turned quiet.  </p>
<p>Alyeska, which operates the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, said on Thursday a loaded ship weighing more than 150,000 dead-weight tonnes was unable to leave the Port of Valdez, until high winds abated.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a vessel that hasn't been able to leave,&quot; said a spokeswoman for the pipeline operator.</p>
<p>Ship traffic through the Valdez Narrows was stopped by the U.S. Coast Guard early Thursday but was reopened to smaller ships by midday, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;That's not serious unless it lasts about four or five days,&quot; a West Coast trader said.</p>
<p>The differential off February WTI has tightened from $1.65 last Friday, to $1.53 Wednesday.</p>
<p>A cargo of San Joaquin Valley heavy crude was bought earlier this week at 15 cents below postings, and traders saw the next deal getting done around 25 under, with supply ample as refineries head into turnaround season.</p>
<p>Mobil, Texaco, and Chevron are planning partial shutdowns while Exxon is expected to bring its entire Benecia plant off line during February.</p>
<p>Bargaining for Line 63 crude turned active, with one trader saying the market stood at $1.00 over Buena Vista crude.</p>
