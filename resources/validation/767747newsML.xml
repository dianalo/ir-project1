<p>Morocco might delay a general election planned in September to November or even later, local newspapers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Al-Bayane said that Interior Minister Driss Basri, presiding over a meeting of the national commission in charge of following up elections, on Monday proposed postponing polls to be held before the general election until September and October.</p>
<p>These ballots are to elect members of a workers' college and some regional bodies.</p>
<p>Al-Bayane added: &quot;Following a certain logic, this makes it likely for general elections to be held in November.&quot;</p>
<p>Liberation newspaper also said the general election, for a lower house of parliament, might be delayed. After the election of the lower house, Morocco's existing one-chamber assembly is to become a two-house parliament.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the national commission had decided that the lower house would have 300 seats and the upper house 255. The official news agency MAP earlier this month had said the two houses would have 330 and 285 seats respectively.</p>
<p>In September last year, Moroccans voted for the creation of a bicameral parliament.</p>
