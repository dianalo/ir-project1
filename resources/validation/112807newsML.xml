<p>Finland will link its currency, the markka, to Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), the government and central bank said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The ECU central rate of the Finnish markka has been agreed to be FIM 5.80661,&quot; the government said in a statement after officials met in Brussels with the European Union's monetary policy committee.</p>
<p>The central bank confirmed that this meant a central rate of 3.0400 markka to one German mark.</p>
<p>&quot;Through participation in the exchange rate mechanism, the Finnish government wants to guarantee that Finland will fulfil all the convergence criteria related to the third stage of economic and monetary union,&quot; the government statement said.</p>
<p>The markka was trading at 2.986 to the German mark at the close of business on Friday. Analysts polled by Reuters on Thursday had expected a central parity rate around 3.03 per mark, in a range of 3.00 to 3.052.</p>
<p>The markka has been floating freely since September 8, 1992. It was briefly linked unilaterally to the European Currency Unit (Ecu) between June and November 1991, when it was devalued by around 12 percent and then re-linked to the Ecu.</p>
<p>But strong foreign exchange market speculation forced it further down in value, and it has since been left to float freely.</p>
<p>The government committee said the markka would be allowed to fluctuate by up to 15 percent against other currencies in the grid, the normal margins since the ERM bands were widened in August 1993 after severe speculative pressure on the system.</p>
<p>&quot;Exchange market developments in Finland and elsewhere in Europe in 1991-93 show that participation in the ERM is not risk-free,&quot; the government statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Wide ... fluctuation limits provide shelter against unwarranted speculation,&quot; it said.</p>
