<title>USA: Enron to provide Amtrak power.</title>
<headline>Enron to provide Amtrak power.</headline>
<dateline>PHILADELPHIA 1997-05-01</dateline>

<p>Enron Capital &amp; Trade Resources said Friday it has agreed to provide the electricity used by Amtrak between New York City and Washington and west to Harrisburg, Pa.</p>
<p>Under the new wholesale power contract, the Enron Corp subsidiary said, Amtrak will reduce its electric traction power costs by more than half, from about $40 million a year.</p>
<p>Amtrak's maximum load for these tracks is 250 megawatts, according to Amy Linden, vice president business development, Northeast Corridor for the National Railroad Passenger Corp -- Amtrak's formal name.  </p>
<p>That powers nearly 600 Amtrak and commuter trains a day on the Northeast Corridor between New York and Washington and another 100 commuter trains on the Keystone line between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Enron said.</p>
<p>Amtrak's average annual useage on these tracks is 600 million kilowatt hours, Linden said.</p>
<p>She said &quot;a little over half of this&quot; was previously provided by PECO Energy Co. The rest came from PP&amp;L Resources Inc and Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co, she added, declining to be more specific.  </p>
<p>Linden said the power to be supplied by Enron powers Northeast Corridor trains from Washington through New York's Pennsylvania Station and under the East River to just short of Amtrak's Sunnyside Yards in the borough of Queens.</p>
<p>Across most of the U.S., Amtrak passenger trains travel on tracks owned by other railroads.</p>
<p>But these tracks are owned by Amtrak and used by communter trains operated state authorities in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Marlyand.  </p>
<p>Amtrak is a wholesale purchaser of power in that it buys energy from a number of suppliers in interstate commerce, Northeast Corridor President George Warrington explained.</p>
<p>Amtrak comingles the purchased energy and transmits it over its own transmission system of power lines in the Northeast Corridor and then resells more than half to commuter rail authorities under set-rate contracts, he said.</p>
<p>The four commuter lines purchasing electric traction energy from Amtrak are NJ TRANSIT; the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, known as SEPTA; Maryland Mass Transit Administration's MARC service, and the Delaware Department of Transportation which purchases power for extended SEPTA service.</p>
<p>&quot;What is particularly exciting about this contract will be our ability to provide significant cost savings to the commuter railroads,&quot; Warrington said.</p>
<p>Amtrak will pass the reduced power costs on to the state commuter agencies, spokesman Rick Remington said.</p>
