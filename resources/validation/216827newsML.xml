<p>Canadian bonds closed stronger on Tuesday, with long-term spreads to U.S. bonds narrowing, amid some overseas buying and term-extension trades, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was buying interest overseas overnight and that sort of set the positive tone for the market. It was more a matter of positive flows rather than fundamental news,&quot; said Arve Bendiksrud, fixed-income analyst with TD Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond rose C$0.50 to C$115.65 to yield 6.727 percent. The U.S. 30-year bonds fell 7/32 to yield 6.44 percent.  </p>
<p>The spread between the two narrowed to 29 basis points from 34 basis at Monday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;There was Japanese buying to start the day very early this morning and there was a little bit of term extension,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;It was just a series of small good things.&quot;</p>
<p>The Canadian market was hit by a wave of new supply. Canada Trustco Mortgage Company set C$250 million in three-year notes and C$350 million in five-year notes.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't that busy, except that the Canada Trust deal did sell. It's been marketed for the last day and a half,&quot; the dealer said.  </p>
<p>The Province of Quebec set a C$400 million, 5.25 percent debenture due April 1, 2002. The issue was priced at C$98.564 with an offering yield of 5.563 percent and a spread of 26 basis points over the Government of Canada 8.5 percent bond due April 1, 2002. The issue was assigned a rating of 'A (low)' by Dominion Bond Rating Service.</p>
<p>Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen's comments before the House of Commons Finance committee were in line with expectations and had little impact on prices, dealers said. Thiessen said the effect of recent rate cuts will not be felt until 1997.  </p>
<p>In other prices, the Government of Canada's 7.0 percent of 2006 rose C$0.23 to C$106.75 to yield 6.088 percent. The U.S. 10-year bond fell 1/32 to yield 6.14 percent.</p>
<p>The negative spread between the two widened to five basis points from almost zero on Monday.</p>
<p>Canada's three-month cash bill traded at 2.73 percent against the U.S. bill at 5.16 percent.</p>
