<p>Indonesian cocoa prices held steady on Wednesday and sustained active short-covering was expected to keep values firm next week despite steadily rising supply, regional traders said.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, buyers were sidelined on the back of ample supplies although average prices quoted by the Malaysia Cocoa Board showed an increase over last week.</p>
<p>The traders said sentiment in Indonesia was also lifted by gains posted in London and New York overnight on short-covering and light speculative buying, respectively.  </p>
<p>&quot;The exporter has been paying very high prices for his beans, and the talk is that the company has large contracts to fill for May,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The company bought some 250 tonnes on Tuesday alone. I reckon it has several thousand tonnes at hand,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Traders said crop arrival at Ujung Pandang had been increasing steadily as the main crop harvest proceeded unhindered, adding that the peak was likely to come in May.</p>
<p>&quot;Supply is improving and more beans are expected to come over the next two months,&quot; he said. &quot;But price increases in London and New York are making some sellers...hold back.&quot;  </p>
<p>The trader said he was finding it difficult to get beans from his regular suppliers because of the active short-covering and higher prices paid by those seeking to fill contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;I am about to ship out a couple of thousand tonnes,&quot; he said. &quot;But getting fresh supply is becoming a problem because sellers are either holding back or selling to buyers who are paying a premium over market prices.&quot;</p>
<p>In Malaysia, the market hardly moved over the last week with both traders and consumers saying they had ample stocks of beans and were not pressed to buy.  </p>
<p>The Malaysian Cocoa Board quoted Standard Malaysian Cocoa (SMC) Grade 1 A out of Tawau, the country's main growing area in the eastern state of Sabah, at an average of 3,310 ringgit a tonne, up 28 ringgit from last week.</p>
<p>The board quoted the SMC 1B grade out of Tawau at an average of 3,258 ringgit, up 18 ringgit from the previous week.</p>
<p>Traders offered the SMC 1A at 3,260 ringgit a tonne and the SMC IB at 3,333-3,343 ringgit.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market's been extremely quiet,&quot; said a trader in Singapore who monitors the Malaysian market. &quot;Everyone seems to have enough bean stocks and there's no fundamental news to urge any buying.&quot;</p>
