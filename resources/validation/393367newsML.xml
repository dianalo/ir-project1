<p>The release of three men jailed for life for the murder of a schoolboy cast new doubts on the fairness of the English justice system on Friday and fuelled fears that more miscarriages of justice are likely to occur.</p>
<p>Britain's Law Society, the national lawyers association, said the release of Michael Hickey, his cousin Vincent Hickey, and James Robinson highlighted the importance of defence lawyers being able to get access to background material to the prosecution's evidence.</p>
<p>&quot;Like other miscarriages of justice it was the result of analysis of how the police investigating the crime came up with the evidence that was presented at the initial trial,&quot; the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>The men, known as the Bridgewater Three, walked free after an Appeal Court ruled that their conviction for the 1979 murder of 13-year-old Carl Bridgewater was unsafe.</p>
<p>They were released on unconditional bail pending on appeal on April 8. Their lawyers said police had tricked a fourth man, Patrick Molloy, who died in prison, into signing a confession.</p>
<p>English legal experts said if access to police notebooks and information about unknown fingerprints found at the scene of the crime were available to the defence at the time of the original trial the Bridgewater miscarriage might never have happened.</p>
<p>Key forensic evidence that a confession by Vincent Hickey had been fabricated was left overlooked in the files for seven years, the court heard on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;You will always get police officers who take a short cut to get a conviction. You will always get forensic scientists who will interpret evidence in a way that suits the people who are instructing them,&quot; said Roger Ede, a defence lawyer and co-author of a book on evidence.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as we have an adversial (justice) system each side has got to have the equality of arms. We have got to have access to the same information.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bridgewater case is the latest in a series of judicial reversals in England. The &quot;Guildford Four&quot; and &quot;Birmingham Six&quot; were released following lengthy prison terms after being wrongly convicted of Irish Republican Army bombings on pubs that killed a total of 26 people.</p>
<p>Lawyers warned that if the British government enforces a new criminal procedure act, similar miscarriages of justice are likely to follow.</p>
<p>Under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 which comes into force in April police will decide what details they believe should be disclosed to the defence, especially any information about weaknesses in their investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the lessons of significant miscarriages of justice, including the Bridgewater case, the government has reduced a defendant's right to comprehensive disclosure of prosecution evidence,&quot; said lawyer Robert Roscoe, chairman of the Law Society's Criminal Law Committee.</p>
<p>Under the new act, defence lawyers wanting to see undisclosed information will have to show the court that it is relevant to the case. Roscoe described it as a classic Catch 22 situation because lawyers won't know if the information is relevant unless they have seen it.</p>
<p>&quot;This can only further imbalance the criminal justice system and further undermine public confidence,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ede added that the needs for checks and balances has been proven by the recent miscarriages of justice, but the government did not seem to have learned the lesson.</p>
<p>&quot;The evidence that the police collect belongs to everyone, not just the prosecution,&quot; he said.</p>
