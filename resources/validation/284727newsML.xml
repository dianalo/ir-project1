<title>SINGAPORE: SIMEX Brent crude plays catch-up to NYMEX gains.</title>

<text>
<p>Brent crude futures rose in thin Thursday trade catching-up with gains in NYMEX crude and heating oil chalked up on the eve of New Year, dealers said.</p>
<p>Sentiment remained bullish on arctic-like weather in Europe and possibly higher prices ahead due to tight inventories.</p>
<p>February Brent on SIMEX traded up to a high of $24.25 per barrel, up 44 cents from its previous close.</p>
<p>&quot;These are just adjustments to where WTI and heating oil went on Tuesday. The arbitrage had widened more than $2.00,&quot; a commission house broker said, noting NYMEX February crude oil had risen 55 cents on Tuesday to $25.92 per barrel.  </p>
<p>IPE's February Brent ended its Tuesday session at $23.81 per barrel, but was expected to open shortly at markedly higher levels aided by prolonged freezing weather in Europe.</p>
<p>But dealers said that while weather remained the driving force of the markets near term, volume was still thin.</p>
<p>&quot;(SIMEX) Brent is valued around $24.20. There is no real market to justify anything higher before London comes in,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>IPE's gas oil futures were expected to resume trading today at up to $3-4 a tonne higher. Cold weather and historically low stocks were seen keeping the firm trend intact.</p>
