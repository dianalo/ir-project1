<p>Malaysia's ambitious Proton car company and its powerful chairman Yahaya Ahmad took a bold step on to the world automotive stage on Wednesday by buying control of Lotus, the troubled British sports car company.</p>
<p>For an investment of 51 million pounds ($82.7 million), partly from Proton and partly from Yahaya himself, the Asian group secured an 80 percent stake in the specialist firm.</p>
<p>It pledged to apply Lotus's well-known technical and product design skills immediately and to start manufacturing its latest sports car, the lightweight Elise, in Malaysia soon.</p>
<p>At a news conference at the Lotus home base in a converted manor house near Norwich, eastern England, Yahaya and the company's outgoing owner and chairman -- Italian entrepreneur Romano Artioli -- explained they had wanted a deal that kept Lotus intact.</p>
<p>&quot;Lotus is a legend -- it's a name that conjures excitement all over the world. It gives Proton an instant capacity to have products in showrooms that have the Lotus image,&quot; Yahaya said.</p>
<p>Artioli said he was glad to have finally found a partner to secure the future of the group's three main businesses -- sports car making, engineering consultancy and motor racing.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I have done my part to ensure that Lotus can now expand its activities,&quot; the Italian entrepreneur told reporters.</p>
<p>The deal ends months of uncertainty for the British firm, when Artioli has struggled to find a big investor to restore its financial muscle, and should help distance Lotus from Artioli's failed attempt to revive the classic Bugatti marque in Italy.</p>
<p>Proton planned an immediate increase in British production of the newly-launched Lotus roadster, the $32,500 Elise, and would then add production capacity in Malaysia, Yahaya said.</p>
<p>&quot;With our contribution we can expand Lotus production here...we will expand capacity immediately,&quot; he said, adding that he could forsee about half of future Elise production of some 5,000 cars per year coming from Proton plants.</p>
<p>Although by far the bigger company, Proton is an industry newcomer and has an immediate need for product and project advice from consultancy arm Lotus Engineering, Yahaya added.</p>
<p>He stressed, however, that Proton would only call on 15 to 20 percent of the capacity of these specialists and wanted to preserve the engineering team's independence so it could keep working for a wide client base of international manufacturers.</p>
<p>Started by motor racing engineer Colin Chapman in 1948, Lotus was once a leading name in Grand Prix racing, winning world championships with drivers Graham Hill, Jim Clark, Jochen Rindt, Emerson Fittipaldi and Mario Andretti.</p>
<p>Though it has consistently made agile and beautiful cars in small numbers, it also has a long history of turbulent finances.</p>
<p>In 1986 it was taken over by General Motors but piled up losses of 50 million pounds in the five years before its sale in 1993 to Artioli's Bugatti International.</p>
<p>Yahaya, dubbed Malaysia's car czar for his wide-ranging interests in the domestic automotive industry, is the controlling shareholder of Proton. He also chairs its parent industrial conglomerate DRB-HICOM.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal he will take a 16.25 percent personal stake in Lotus alongside Proton's 63.75 percent. Artioli will remain on the board, but not as chairman.</p>
<p>Industry analysts in Malaysia lauded Yahaya's latest move.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very strategic buy. The deal is very positive for Proton in terms of technology transfer and bringing Proton into the luxury sports car sector,&quot; said Patrick Lim, automotive analyst at Jupiter Securities in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>The deal should also bring Proton the advanced engine technology it has long sought, analysts added.</p>
<p>Lotus has just finished development of a new engine, its first in 24 years, which powers its large Esprit sports coupe. It intends to offer it to other manufacturers in various forms.</p>
