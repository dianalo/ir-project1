<title>MEXICO: Mexico stocks defy Dow, rise rate hopes.</title>
<headline>Mexico stocks defy Dow, rise rate hopes.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks posted solid gains Tuesday, shrugging off a sharp drop on Wall Street.</p>
<p>&quot;Gains were very firm, the market discounted positive factors like expected falls in domestic primary rates,&quot; said Diego Candano, equity research director at the IXE brokerage in Mexico City.</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index ended up 36.50 points, or 0.97 percent, at 3,797.05. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 58.92 points, or 0.85 percent, to 6,896.56.</p>
<p>Investors said there was a growing belief the U.S. Federal Reserve would not raise U.S. rates next week and a drug policy dispute between Washington and Mexico City was losing steam.</p>
<p>In addition, Mexico City money market traders said they expected rates on government bonds to fall almost a full point, according to a Reuter survey.</p>
<p>Some dealers said favourable industrial output figures helped bolster share prices. The Finance Ministry announced industrial output in January had climbed 8.8 percent from year-ago figures.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was very selective. Dealers picked up low-priced blue chips. I feel the industrial output figures fuelled buying,&quot; a desk trader said.</p>
<p>Trading volume was a moderate 75.5 million shares. An initial public offering by Minsa accounted for 14.2 million shares.</p>
<p>A total of 105 stocks changed hands on the broad market, with gainers beating losers by 53 to 32.</p>
<p>Corn flour firm Minsa C shares closed unchanged from their issue price of 11.19 pesos ($1.41).</p>
<p>Financial group Banacci was a prominent gainer, up 80 centavos (10 cents) to 18.80 pesos ($2.37 pesos), followed by food company Grupo Corvi, which gained 19 centavos (two cents) to 4.50 pesos (57 cents) on speculative buying, traders said.</p>
<p>Serfin financial group declined five centavos (less than one cent) to 3.45 pesos (43 cents).</p>
<p>Serfin announced it was about to finalise a partial sale to &quot;an Asian bank,&quot; but news of a 1996 net loss totalling almost 7 billion pesos was still ringing in traders' ears.</p>
<p>&quot;The market had discounted the Serfin deal. It was the only viable option, so there was little reaction,&quot; a desk trader said.</p>
<p>Debt-ridden holding company Sidek headed the losers' list, off six centavos (less than one cent) to 40 centavos, followed by its tourism arm Situr, which fell three centavos (less than one cent) to 24 centavos (three cents).</p>
