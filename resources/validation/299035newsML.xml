<p>The Brazilian government has agreed to refinance 11.3 billion reais of debt owed by the state of Rio de Janeiro, a Rio official said.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Rio will repay its debts to the central government over 30 years and has agreed to retire 20 percent of its debt stock through selling off assets, Rio state planning secretary Marco Aurelio Alencar told reporters.  </p>
<p>Rio also agreed to dedicate 11 percent of its tax revenues for debt servicing, rising to 13.5 pct.  The state will pay interest of six percent above inflation on its debt, Alencar said.</p>
<p>However, given that Rio may not be able raise 20 percent of its debt through asset sales, the state may also opt to sell off an equivalent of 10 percent of its debt stock and pay interest of 7.5 percent above inflation on the rest, he said.</p>
<p>Those assets would include Banerj, the bank Rio twice tried to privatize in December but failed to after court orders held up the auction.  </p>
<p>&quot;The financial situation (of the state) is going to be tight but it is the price we have to pay,&quot; Alencar said.</p>
<p>The deal, which has yet to be approved by the Brazilian Senate and the Rio state legislature, is the latest in a series to be struck by central and state governments in a bid to straighten out the states' precarious finances.</p>
<p>By insisting on privatization and other measures to boost fiscal probity, the central government hopes to reduce the contribution of the states to Brazil's public sector deficit.</p>
