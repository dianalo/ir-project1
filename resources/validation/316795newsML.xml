<p>Peru's deputy energy minister Jorge San Roman, one of 73 hostages held by Marxist rebels in Lima, was serenaded on Friday with a rendition of Elvis Presley's &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; to mark his 57th birthday.</p>
<p>San Roman's staff, accompanied his wife and relatives, sang to him from outside the residence, and also sang the traditional birthday song &quot;Las Mananitas.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are both hostages of this situation,&quot; his wife Marta de San Roman told reporters.</p>
<p>The minister is known to be a big music fan, and earlier in the standoff mediators took in a guitar for him to use to entertain his fellow hostages.</p>
<p>Rebels of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement stormed the residence of the Japanese ambassador to Peru on December 17 to demand the release of some 400 jailed colleagues.</p>
<p>They were still holding 73 captives following the release on Friday of Luis Valencia Hirano, whom the Red Cross said was freed for medical reasons. He was the first hostage to be released in 17 days.</p>
