<p>Sunni Moslem militants, angered by a bomb blast that killed their leader and 25 other people, set an Iranian cultural centre on fire in the Pakistani city of Lahore on Sunday.</p>
<p>Saturday's bombing, which Sunni hardliners blamed on Iran and the local Shi'ite group Tehrik-i-Jafria Pakistan, raised fears of sectarian unrest just two weeks before elections on February 3. Tehrik-i-Jafria condemned the blast.</p>
<p>Witnesses said activists of the Sunni Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan  group attacked and burned the Iranian centre in a two-storey building in central Lahore, capital of populous Punjab province.</p>
<p>People were evacuated from upper-floor offices. There were no reports of casualties.</p>
<p>The Iranian embassy in Pakistan condemned the attack on the Lahore centre as &quot;terrorism&quot; and asked Pakistani authorities to arrest those who carried it out, Iranian radio said.</p>
<p>Thousands of people watched the body of Sunni leader Zia-ur-Rahman Faruqi being taken through Lahore. He was later buried in the central Punjab town of Jhang. Many joined in prayers for him at a Lahore mosque.</p>
<p>Faruqi was killed in a bomb blast outside the Sessions Court in Lahore on Saturday, shortly before he and his deputy Azam Tariq were due to appear on charges of involvement in the sectarian murders of a score of Shi'ites.</p>
<p>The official news agency APP quoted police as saying the bomb death toll had climbed to 26, including 19 policemen, while 25 of about 90 wounded remained in critical condition.</p>
<p>Tariq, who survived a grenade and rocket attack in 1994, was seriously wounded. APP said his mother died of shock after hearing about Saturday's bombing.</p>
<p>The remote-control bomb, apparently left on a motorcycle, went off shortly after noon as Faruqi and Tariq arrived at the court and supporters showered them with flowers.</p>
<p>President Farooq Leghari condemned the bombing as &quot;a dastardly act of terrorism&quot;.</p>
<p>No group has claimed responsibility. The attack appeared to be the latest in a long-running feud between militants in Pakistan's majority Sunni and minority Shi'ite communities, which cost about 170 lives last year.</p>
<p>Shi'ites form about 15 percent of Pakistan's population of over 130 million, but are a majority in neighbouring Iran.</p>
<p>The secretary of Iran's National Security Council, Hassan Rowhani, urged Islamabad last week to crack down on what he called terrorist groups and prevent killings of Shi'ites.</p>
<p>The Sipah-i-Sahaba called the Iranian statement an interference in Pakistan's internal affairs.</p>
<p>On Sunday, newspapers quoted a spokesman from the Sunni group as saying that Iran was providing Shi'ite groups with guns and money.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been warning the government about Iranian backing for the Pakistani Shi'ite community,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shi'ite militancy in Pakistan was fuelled by the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, brnging a backlash from well-armed Sunni groups.</p>
