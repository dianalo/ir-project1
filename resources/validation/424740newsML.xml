<p>French bond futures never really recovered from a weak start on Thursday after a spate of short selling on GLOBEX, but survived tests of support close to 131, prompting some traders to say the worst of the falls was over.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all said the French bond market would struggle to make much progress until key U.S. February non-farm payrolls figures, due at 1330 GMT on Friday, were out of the way although a relatively strong rise in jobs had already been priced in.</p>
<p>Some said the March bond contract, which closed down 0.26 at 131.28, would have been better positioned for a technical rebound if it had settled above 131.40/50.  </p>
<p>&quot;I'm reasonably confident going forward because the reaction of the market was healthy at the levels hit following U.S. investor selling, notably from funds,&quot; a trader at a French brokerage said.</p>
<p>He said the selling had not been followed by other non-residents nor domestic investors. &quot;We've gone back to 10-year yield levels between 5.55 and 5.60 percent which are more normal given the background of EMU scepticism,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Andrew Davies, analyst at London Bond Broking said there was no doubt U.S. dollar bonds were the &quot;flavour of the month&quot; and it looked as though the core European rally had run its course.  </p>
<p>&quot;Core Europe' has not got much to benefit from a breakdown in EMU and they're not going to cut German rates,&quot; he said. &quot;The markets are pretty tightly rangebound while they wait for the U.S. numbers tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>A futures trader at a French brokerage in Paris said &quot;the jobs numbers shouldn't unsettle to the extent that the market's psychology towards them has totally changed&quot;. He said even an increase of more than 250,000, there wouldn't be panic selling.</p>
<p>He said the March contract had Elliot wave support at 131.14/18 and a Fibonacci support at 130.98, and today's session put it in good shape for a rebound to 131.74/76.  </p>
<p>An options broker at a French brokerage said while he advised caution ahead of the U.S. jobs numbers, investors had been selling &quot;strangles&quot; on the grounds that they believed the bond market correction had nearly come to an end. He said they were selling puts on the bond future at 129 and calls at 133.</p>
<p>He also said investors who had covered their positions during the rally by buying puts were now unwinding these options positions as they took profits on bond futures.</p>
<p>French 10-year bonds recovered after underperforming German bonds leading into the OAT auction this morning and the spread returned to minus 12 from minus seven earlier in the day.  </p>
<p>The Treasury sold 24.23 billion francs of fixed and variable rate OATs at auction with an overall bid to cover ratio of 2.6 which was higher than some had feared. Demand for the new 2009 TEC 10 was fairly buoyant despite the less favourable market conditions for the instrument.</p>
<p>June PIBOR contracts remained stuck in a narrow two-basis point range, surviving an early test of support at 96.60. The spread between June Euromarks narrowed one basis point to 14.</p>
<p>The franc was steady against the mark but continued to decline, along with the mark, against the dollar. It touched a low 5.8042, down from 5.1885 at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Both the intervention rate and call money were left unchanged.</p>
