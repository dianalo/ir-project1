<p>Dade County, Fla., Finance Director Ed Marquez said the county was satisfied with the level of disclosure Grigsby Brandford &amp; Co Inc provided for a $183 million a bond refunding deal it underwrote for the county.</p>
<p>Sources told Reuters that another syndicate member on the deal, Howard Gary &amp; Co, had written Grigsby Brandford a letter questioning whheter the firm had properly disclosed a key feature of the offering to investors.</p>
<p>Company president Howard Gary wrote Grigsby Brandford four days before the Dade County deal closed on September 10 asking why it did not disclose in the official statement that the swaps provider, GBR Financial Products, is part owned by Calvin Grigsby and Napolean Brandford, owners and founders of Grigsby Brandford, the sources said, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Marquez said the relationship was not revealed in the offering statement for the deal, but that the county was aware of it.</p>
<p>&quot;We've done a swap with them before and were well aware of it and were quite comfortable with the level of disclosure they had in their OS,&quot; Marquez said.</p>
<p>Smith Barney Inc was co-senior manager and AIBC Investment Services Corp and Howard Gary &amp; Co were co-managers in the syndicate.</p>
<p>Marquez said the county was also satisfied that it got market rate on the transaction, although the county did not know how much profit Grigsby Branford made on the swap portion.</p>
<p>&quot;We got confirmation from our financial adviser that the prices we were paying for the swap, which included all the costs and fees and profits, et cetera, was the market rate,&quot; Marquez said. &quot;We know what rate we paid and we know what we paid was a market rate.&quot;</p>
<p>Grigsby Brandford declined to comment.</p>
