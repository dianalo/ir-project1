<p>If upward momentum in New Zealand business confidence can be sustained over the next few months it may signal an end to the trough in economic activity, the National Bank of New Zealand said on Monday.</p>
<p>A NBNZ survey shows business confidence rose for the third consective month in September, with a net 21 percent of respondents seeing better business conditions over the next year.</p>
<p>&quot;In Spring things blossom; flowers, trees, romance and business confidence,&quot; the bank said.  </p>
<p>In August, a net six percent of respondents expected business conditions to improve over the next year and in July, while confidence rebounded, net confidence remained firmly negative with 16 percent expecting a deterioration in business conditions.</p>
<p>NBNZ said the September results were enormously encouraging, adding: &quot;If the rise is sustained over the next few months then the trough in economic activity can genuinely be declared over.&quot;  </p>
<p>The September gain was across all groups, with the service sector leading the charge. The largest turnaround came from the agricultural sector, from a net 25 percent expecting a downturn last month, to balance this month.</p>
<p>NBNZ said that last month it lamented the torrid time exporters had been undergoing, and had also commented that the domestic economy continued to slow.</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing that has changed this month is that respondents are more confident, leaving us in search of the x-factor.&quot;  </p>
<p>Possible explanations included encouraging signs from the global economy and positive sales and profit growth in the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>NBNZ said a key to the relative optimism was the net 42 percent of respondents anticipating lower interest rates -- a significant swing from the net 40 percent expecting an increase as recently as June.</p>
<p>However, the bank noted, its survey was taken before the Reserve Bank's September economic projections, which firmly crushed any hope of immediate interest rate relief.  </p>
<p>&quot;They (the RB) have left the door open though for lower rates in the new year, and fixed rate mortgages have already edged downward,&quot; the bank observed.</p>
<p>A net 30 percent of respondents anticipated an increase in their own business activity. This was reflected in expected gains in profits, exports, investment and employment, but inflation expectations remain unchanged at 2.6 percent.</p>
<p>NBNZ said the Reserve Bank could continue to bask in the subdued outlook for residential construction over the next year. Investment intentions in that area revealed the number of optimists exactly offsetting the pessimists.  </p>
<p>NBNZ said while the survey was &quot;unambiguously positive&quot;, the optimists should keep the champagne corks in for a while yet as several hurdles had yet to be cleared, including an election.</p>
<p>New Zealand goes to the polls on October 12 for a general election under a new proportional voting system which favours a minority or coalition government.</p>
<p>&quot;Ongoing confidence appears linked to the scent of lower interest rates, strengthening international activity, and the rising possibility that politicians may not yet tamper with the fundamentals. Touch wood,&quot; the bank said.</p>
