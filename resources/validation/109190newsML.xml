<p>A government panel is expected to recommend opening Israel's domestic telecommunications market to unlimited competition over the next seven years, the daily Yedioth Ahronoth reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The newspaper said a draft being prepared by a joint committee of the Finance and Communications ministries called for limited competition on inter-city calls starting in 1998 and local calls from the year 2000. By 2005, telecommunications would be opened to full competition.</p>
<p>Officials at the Telecommunications Ministry were unavailable for comment. A spokesman for the Finance Ministry could not confirm any details of the panel's draft.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Bezeq Israel Telecom, the state-controlled phone monopoly, said the company was not involved in the committee's deliberations.</p>
<p>Yediot said the draft called for opening inter-urban telecommunications between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, Israel's two biggest cities, and between Haifa and Tiberias in two years' time. It said the most likely competitors would be the Railroads Authority and state-owned Israel Electric Corp because they have right-of-way on which to run cable.</p>
<p>The full opening of telecommunications to competition in 2005 would enable cable television companies to offer phone and other services over their networks. Bezeq in return would be permitted to offer cable television and other services now prohibited to it.</p>
<p>Bezeq's monopoly has been whittled away over the last few years. Cellular phone service was opened to limited competiton at the end of 1994, when a consortium called Cellcom was licensed as a second operator. A tender for a third licensee is expected to be published soon.</p>
<p>In addition, six groups have bid in a government tender for two licences to operate international phone service in competition with Bezeq. The tender has yet to be awarded.</p>
<p>If the draft recommendations are adopted, parliament will have to amend the law which still reserves certain monopolies for Bezeq.</p>
