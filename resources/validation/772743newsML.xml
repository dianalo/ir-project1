<p>Japanese operator of cram schools Dai-Ichi  Kyoken Co Ltd said on Friday that it had agreed to merge with Gakukikusha  Co Ltd, which manages preparatory schools.</p>
<p>A Dai-Ichi Kyoken official could not immediately give further details  on the planned merger.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is true that we have agreed to merge with Gakuikusha,&quot; the company  official said, without specifying the possible date for the merger  or other details.</p>
<p>Gakuikusha meanwhile said in a statement that the company plans to  hold a news conference in Tokyo on the planned merger with Osaka-based  Dai-Ichi Kyoken at 11.30 a.m. (0230 GMT).</p>
<p>Earlier, the Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA) said it would  temporarily suspend trading of the firms' shares, which are registered  on the over-the-counter market, in order to confirm information which  could affect investment decisions.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Dai-Ichi Kyoken shares ended the session at 624 yen,  while Gakuikusha stood at 740 yen at the close.</p>
<p>The financial daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported on Friday that the  two companies had agreed to merge by spring 1998 in order to strengthen  business in the increasingly competitive education industry at home.  The two firms have had a business tie-up since April, when Dai-Ichi  Kyoken obtained 10 percent of exsisting shares of Gakuikusha.</p>
