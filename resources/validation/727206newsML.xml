<headline>F.O.Licht - Daily sugar report.</headline>
<text>
<p>The following is a direct contribution from commodity statistician F.O. Licht in Ratzeburg, Germany. Please address any queries to Helmut Ahlfeld on +00 49 4541 88920.</p>
<p>SUGAR - World market for July 11, 1997</p>
<p>White sugar futures in London closed marginally higher across the board. Front month August finished at $321.90, up $0.70, while October added $0.90 to close at $315.60 per tonne.</p>
<p>Raw sugar futures in New York ended a thinly traded session higher with front month October adding 3 points to close at 11.09 cents/lb. March closed at 11.25 cents/lb, up 1 point. Prices could come under pressure on Monday following Brazil's decision to practically free sugar exports. Even though that will not materially affect the supply and demand balance, the decision could have a psychological impact.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>BRAZIL - After Brazil's Industry and Commerce Ministry increased export quotas for 1997/98 by 1.67 million tonnes, tel quel, the Central Bank the same day released a circular reducing the tax on all exports of sugar and derivatives to zero which effectively makes the quota increase irrelevant. Sugar exports traditionally have been governed by quotas set out in the government crop plan issued at the beginning of the season and which are allocated by individual factory.</p>
<p>These quotas can be exported tax-free, otherwise they are liable to a 40 per cent export tax. Any additional quotas have to be negotiated with the government although in the past this has proved to be a lengthy process. The other key issue is the fact that the export tax is still being retained, albeit at zero. This still gives the government the power to increase the tax if it believes that internal sugar and alcohol supply is being compromised.</p>
<p>UKRAINE - Sugar exports in May 1997 reached 91,185 tonnes, raw value, down from 122,294 tonnes exported in April 1997.

Major countries of destination in 1997 were Russia with 313,899 tonnes whites, Belarus with 32,900 tonnes, Turkmenistan with 16,600 tonnes and Azerbaijan with 15,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>DENMARK - Sugar imports in April 1997 amounted to 10,177 tonnes, raw value, up from 2,148 tonnes imported in April 1996.
