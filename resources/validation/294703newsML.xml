<p>Several carriers have increased cargo rates on prime routes from Paris during the traditionally quiet first fortnight of January a Reuter survey has shown.</p>
<p>Trans World Airlines increased its ex-Paris cargo rates by an average of three percent on its daily Boeing 767-300 passenger service between Paris and New York and Boston, effective January 1.</p>
<p>&quot;The increases do not indicate an upturn on transatlantic routes but are rather an attempt at recovering lost ground in terms of cargo yields over the past couple of years, particularly in 1995,&quot; Jean-Claude Turlier, TWA's cargo manager France/Switzerland, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said abundant capacity continues as the dominant feature on transatlantic routes, with the trend accentuated during the first half of January when demand is traditionally flat.</p>
<p>&quot;Introducing rates increases at this time of the year is a bit of gamble but one we have been obliged to take out of economic necessity. We'll only have a clear idea of any negative reaction by forwarders later in the month or in February,&quot; Turlier said.</p>
<p>&quot;A rise of around three percent may appear minor, but it is put into perspective when one considers that there are carriers on routes to North America who are still more than ready to cut rates.&quot;</p>
<p>The rise in the U.S. dollar, against the French franc and other continental European currencies over the past six weeks had not yet had an impact on export traffic to North America but if the trend continued it could only have a beneficial effect, Turlier added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on France-Japan routes, All Nippon Airlines (ANA) and Japan Airlines (JAL), announced 50 centimes/kilo increases on ex-Paris cargo rates from January 1.</p>
<p>The increases work out at between three and four percent on the average per kilo rate on the Paris-Japan route.</p>
<p>&quot;In Autumn 1996, our rates remained unchanged, having previously increased, on a regular basis, every six months, nor did we apply a fuel surcharge. These factors gave us scope to increase rates early in 1997 on a route where demand is very buoyant at present,&quot; said ANA's Paris-CDG cargo manager, Marc Foussel.</p>
<p>As for the  market's outlook, Klaus Pfab, chairman of France's air freight forwarding agents association, SNAGFA, says 1997 will be a better year than 1996.</p>
<p>He forecasts market growth of between four and five percent in tonnage terms compared to two percent in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Frankly, we expected better from 1996 but this didn't materialise. However, one positive note was that a strong final quarter raised hopes of an underlying recovery beneath the traditional end-of-year-rush.&quot;</p>
<p>The economic cycles of peaks and troughs are becoming shorter and for that reason low growth can only prevail for so long and 1997 will probably mark a turning-point, Pfab said.</p>
<p>The prospect of a strong U.S. dollar in relation to the French franc should provide a boost to exports to North America, the major air cargo market from the Paris airports gateways, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;With a few exceptions, it appears most of the major carriers are planning to increase cargo capacity next year which should check any upward spiralling in rates. However, that's not to say there won't be rates increases in 1997,&quot; Pfab stated.</p>
<p>Two main cargo carriers, Lufthansa and KLM, have already indicated their intention to up rates in the Spring.</p>
<p>KLM's Paris cargo office told Reuters the Dutch carrier planned to increase ex-Paris rates &quot;probably by between ten to 12 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The last quarter of 1996 saw us utilising cargo capacity more or less to the full on routes to the Far East, North America and South America and we are optimistic for 1997,&quot; a cargo official for the airline said.</p>
<p>Ulrich Link, Lufthansa's managing director for cargo in France and Switzerland said the airline plans increases of between five and ten percent on its ex-France rates, to several destinations, effective March 1.</p>
<p>Lufthansa recently increased its France-India rates by six to seven percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Cargo rates at their current level are undervalued and simply do not allow airlines to make sufficient yields. In the past, we operated in a tightly-regulated industry with largely state-owned airlines not too concerned whether they made money from cargo activities or not. However, it is now a drastically different environment where cost-consciousness is the keyword,&quot; Link stated.</p>
<p>&quot;When one considers the healthy profits made by some of the industry's principal customers - luxury goods and telecoms equipment manufacturers, for example, - perhaps they should be paying more for air cargo services,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>On Far East routes, Korean Airlines (KAL) is one airline anxious to see rate increases.</p>
<p>Having last adjusted its ex-Paris rates in April 1996, KAL had pencilled in increases of five to ten percent from autumn 1996. However, these had to be shelved because the market had not provided the necessary impetus to carry them through.</p>
<p>&quot;We are optimistic about 1997 with market indicators showing strong demand in Korea for European consumer goods and also a growing preference among shippers and forwarders for 'direct' routes to Seoul. However, the positive outlook aside, it is imperative that rates increases are implemented given the erosion in yields and the spring period would be an opportune time,&quot; a Paris-based KAL cargo official said.</p>
<p>Apart from increases in ex-Paris rates to Japan, the past month or so has seen rates firming on routes to Hong Kong and Taipei, as the increases implemented in the last quarter of 1996 by carriers such as Cathay Pacific and Eva Air, filtered through to the market.</p>
<p>Ex-Paris rates to North America are largely stable.</p>
