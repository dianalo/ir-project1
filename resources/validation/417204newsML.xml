<p>Long-suffering villagers have turned on their former tormentors in north western Liberia, hunting down former fighters and hacking them to death with machetes and spears, peacekeepers and survivors say.</p>
<p>But with a peace deal being implemented and elections due on May 30, West African peacekeepers say the villagers must forgive and forget the horrors of seven years of civil war and have condemned such attacks as criminal and illegal.</p>
<p>&quot;The Liberian citizens have now formed the habit of terrorising disarmed fighters in an attempt to (take) revenge for the years of suffering they went through at the hands of the fighters before disarmament,&quot; the commander of the Nigerian-led peacekeeping force said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The chasing around and molesting of former fighters who have been disarmed in the quest of national peace is criminal and illegal,&quot; General Victor Malu added.</p>
<p>Vilagers hacked to death six former fighters from the ethnic Krahn ULIMO-J faction loyal to former warlord Roosevelt Johnson in Grand Cape Mount last week. Their local commander reported fleeing for his life in the face of the onslaught.</p>
<p>Peacekeepers say villagers, once terrorised by armed young men whose word was law, were turning on known ex-fighters.</p>
<p>&quot;Civilians are going about, especially in northwestern Grand Cape Mount and Bomi counties, armed with cutlasses (machetes) and sticks in the name of vigilante groups waylaying known former fighters,&quot; Malu said.</p>
<p>He urged villagers to put the past behind them and divert their energies into uncovering hidden arms caches and telling the peacekeepers about them. &quot;We can recover all unsurrendered weapons and further make the country safe for all,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Liberia's warlords have rallied around a peace plan brokered by their West African neighbours to restore peace to the nation that freed American slaves and was founded in 1847.</p>
<p>A formal disarmament exercise ended in early February with Malu saying he was satisfied that presidential and parliamentary elections could go ahead on May 30 as scheduled even though some weapons were not handed over.</p>
<p>Charles Taylor, who launched the war from Ivory Coast in 1989, and rivals Alhaji Kromah and George Boley plan to run for president. All three resigned from the transitional ruling state council as required under the peace plan.</p>
<p>Johnson has spurned politics, saying he will go into business.</p>
<p>The United States, with which Liberia has strong emotional ties, has been flying in extra West African peacekeepers from Mali and Ghana to boost the force to more than 11,000.</p>
<p>Well over 150,000 people were killed in the war.</p>
