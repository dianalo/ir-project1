<p>Hundreds of foreigners were airlifted out of Phnom Penh on Tuesday, fleeing political turmoil and looting in Cambodia as co-Premier Hun Sen told the world to stay out of the country's affairs.</p>
<p>Eight flights of Thai Air Force C-130s brought 800 people, mainly Thais and some foreigners, from the Cambodian capital after three days of violence that has claimed at least 58 lives. More planes were due to fly out later in the day.</p>
<p>The fate of some 200 tourists and aid workers trapped by fighting around the northern town of Siem Reap, home to the fabled Angkor Wat temple complex, was less clear.</p>
<p>A military official said they were being evacuated to Phnom Penh by helicopter after earlier plans to flee to the Thai border by road were aborted following overnight clashes nearby.</p>
<p>Police in the southern port city of Sihanoukville said rival forces were also confronting each other there.</p>
<p>The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) called for an immediate ceasefire between the two sides -- forces loyal to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and those of First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who fled to France last week before the fighting began.</p>
<p>&quot;ASEAN is dismayed by and deeply regrets the unfortunate turn of events in Cambodia, resulting in the loss of innocent lives, both of Cambodian citizens and of foreigners,&quot; the seven-member grouping said in a statement on Tuesday. Cambodia, along with Burma and Laos, was scheduled to join the seven-member ASEAN later this month, but the collapse of the troubled coalition has thrown this in doubt. ASEAN foreign ministers plan a special meeting on Thursday in Kuala Lumpur to discuss the situation.</p>
<p>The Phnom Penh fighting began on Saturday after Hun Sen's troops moved against Ranariddh's men.</p>
<p>Hun Sen announced in a Sunday night radio broadcast that the prince, son of King Norodom Sihanouk who is now in Beijing, was no longer First Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Ranariddh denounced the move as a coup and on Tuesday told reporters in Paris that a new civil war could sweep Cambodia if Hun Sen refused to share power with him.</p>
<p>&quot;I am willing to see Hun Sen to solve this problem in an existing legal framework, but if we cannot, there would be, alas, a civil war in my poor country,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ranariddh and Hun Sen agreed to rule Cambodia together after a U.N.-sponsored election in May 1993.</p>
<p>Royalist defence minister Tea Champat, well respected by soldiers of both sides, was planning to fly to Phnom Penh from Thailand on Wednesday to try to maintain a role for Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party in the government.</p>
<p>A senior FUNCINPEC official said Tea Champat would go to Phnom Penh as the party's representative and suggested he might even be able to take Ranariddh's place in the ruling coalition.</p>
<p>The official, who asked not to be named, appealed to the international community to help mediate.</p>
<p>But earlier Hun Sen said the world should stay out of Cambodia's affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;Let the Cambodian people solve this problem by themselves without any interference and external pressure,&quot; he said in a speech broadcast on television.</p>
<p>Phnom Penh was quiet on Tuesday but markets, shops and offices remained closed after a night broken by bursts of apparently random rifle fire.</p>
<p>Siem Reap was also quiet following overnight fighting which occurred when forces loyal to Ranariddh were withdrawing from Siem Reap to join comrades nearby.</p>
<p>&quot;Last night the remaining FUNCINPEC forces were able to extricate themselves from the town after a two-day standoff,&quot; a western source said.</p>
<p>Siem Reap town was under the control of Hun Sen's forces, while large areas of the surrounding countryside were held by Ranariddh's troops.</p>
<p>Hun Sen's forces have long outnumbered those under Ranariddh in Phnom Penh and in the east. The First Prime Minister's forces have greater strength in the north and northwest of the country.</p>
<p>Khmer Rouge guerrillas, with whom Ranariddh were negotiating peace before the fighting erupted, control remote countryside in the far north while a powerful faction of Khmer Rouge defectors controls territory along the Thai border in the west.</p>
<p>Hun Sen had said he had to take action against Ranariddh because the co-premier was trying to smuggle Khmer Rouge defectors into the city to boost his troop strength.</p>
<p>There were still no official casualty figures from the two days of fighting and a subsequent day of looting and random violence in the capital. A police source said preliminary investigation showed there were 58 deaths, both combatants and civilians, and as many as 200 wounded in the violence. Phnom Penh hospital sources said most casualties were civilians caught in crossfire and one city centre hospital said it was caring for 77 wounded.</p>
