<p>An official at Japan's Postal Life Insurance Bureau (Kampo) said on Monday that the bureau expected to erase all of its currency losses on its foreign bond holdings because of the strong dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect currency losses to have been eliminated as of the end of fiscal 1996/97,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Generally speaking, this makes it easier for us to invest in foreign bonds compared with the time we had huge forex losses in the past. But we'd like to keep watching which direction the dollar/yen rate moves (before investing in foreign assets),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The official said the actual figures for the 1996/97 fiscal year ended March would be announced later this year.</p>
<p>Kampo's currency losses totalled 223.9 billion yen in the year ended March 31, 1996, down from the 904.2 billion yen in 1994/95 and the record high of 912.1 billion in 1993/94.</p>
<p>Kampo is the largest institutional investor in Japan with total assets of 97.22 trillion yen as of the end of February.</p>
<p>The latest survey of Kampo's assets showed that foreign bond holdings totalled 4.27 trillion yen, or 4.4 percent of the total.</p>
<p>Kampo's investment in Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and bonds from other government-related institutions stood at 35.04 trillion yen, or 36 percent of the total.  </p>
<p>Asked if Kampo thought JGB yields had hit bottom, the official declined to comment.</p>
<p>Kampo has said it plans to cut the volume of new lending to government-affiliated financial institutions and other quasi-government bodies for the fiscal investment and loan programme (FILP) in the year started on April 1.</p>
<p>Instead, it plans fresh investment of 6.6025 trillion yen in domestic and foreign bonds in 1997/98, up by 64.4 percent from the previous year, out of total investment funds of 14.2944 trillion yen in 1997/98.</p>
