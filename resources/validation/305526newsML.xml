<p>Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, delighted at Russian leader Boris Yeltsin's call to speed a proposed merger of their states, opened a new chamber of parliament and ignored new Western censure of his rule.</p>
<p>Lukashenko on Monday inaugurated the Council of the Republic, the upper house of a new assembly packed with his supporters, created after he secured victory in a November referendum on expanding his powers. The old parliament, many of whose members opposed him, was dissolved.</p>
<p>&quot;You have nothing to be ashamed of. You are not pretenders. You are elected by the people,&quot; Lukashenko told the chamber.</p>
<p>&quot;The most dreadful thing before was legislation which did not work in our poor country. Your job is to check laws passed by the lower house to ensure they do work.&quot;</p>
<p>In the French city of Strasbourg, the Council of Europe suspended Belarus's special guest status, saying the new legislature had no democratic legitimacy.</p>
<p>Leni Fischer, president of the parliamentary assembly of the Council, which oversees human rights in Europe, pronounced Belarus's new constitution illegal and falling short of minimum democratic standards. Belarus remains the only country outside former Yugoslavia yet to be admitted to the Council.</p>
<p>Lukashenko expressed pleasure at an announcement in Moscow that Yeltsin, bedridden with pneumonia, wanted to speed up efforts at union. He has long complained that a pact creating a &quot;community&quot; signed last April has made little progress.</p>
<p>&quot;If Boris Niklolayevich is ready, you know my position -- I have long been ready,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;This is our baby, mine and the Russian president's. And I think we should promote this process, and implement it.&quot;</p>
<p>Lukashenko brushes aside accusations that he runs roughshod over elementary freedoms in his country of 10 million.</p>
<p>Last month, he bluntly told leaders attending a summit of the 54-nation Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe not to meddle in the affairs of his former Soviet republic sandwiched between Russia and Poland.</p>
<p>Belarus's new 64-member upper house is made up of officials elected to generally conservative local councils plus a number of members appointed by Lukashenko.</p>
<p>Lukashenko's five appointees were conservatives and included officials who once acted as chairman of parliament, head of the supreme court and health minister.</p>
<p>The representatives from local government were virtually unknown to the Belarussian public and included state and collective farm directors, teachers and doctors.</p>
<p>Deputies stood to the Soviet-era national anthem, entitled &quot;Belarussians together with fraternal Russia&quot;, and voted in rapid succession to approve unanimously candidates for the chamber's chairman and his deputy.</p>
<p>&quot;You can see we have professionals here and not the whining bunch we had before,&quot; Lukashenko said in applauding the votes.</p>
<p>The new lower chamber, the House of Representatives, has already begun its sessions and has all but completed debate on the budget with little dissent.</p>
<p>Since coming to power in July 1994, Lukashenko has suspended trade unions, kept strict controls on the press and tried to derail elections even before November's referendums.</p>
<p>Openly nostalgic for the defunct Soviet Union, he reinstated in past referendums a flag and coat of arms almost identical to those used before the collapse of the superpower.</p>
<p>He also enhanced the status of the Russian language alongside the rarely-used Belarussian tongue which the country's first post-Soviet leaders tried to encourage.</p>
