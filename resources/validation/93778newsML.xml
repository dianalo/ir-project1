<p>Diesel prices in Asia rallied to a post-Gulf War high on strong European and U.S. prices as well as firm crude levels, trading sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A 220,000-barrel cargo of diesel traded at $29.70 per barrel on an FOB basis -- the highest level since the 1990/1991 Gulf War. The cargo was bought late on Wednesday by a U.S. trader from a European oil major in the Singapore market, which sets Asian prices.</p>
<p>The previous record was set in early September when diesel traded at $27.95.</p>
<p>Traders said the high price of diesel would exacerbate weak demand and reduce sales outlets.</p>
<p>&quot;Other than U.S. and Europe, where heating oil inventories are low, there is not much demand in Asia other than normal requirements from Indonesia and latent demand from China,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;The (Asian) market should be well balanced. I don't think fundamentals are strong enough to support the $29.70-level traded,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Traders said the U.S. buyer of the diesel needed a 45,000-tonne cargo to cover a previously-arranged sale to India, so was willing to pay a high price.</p>
<p>But the high diesel price is providing little cheer for refiners. The sustained strength of crude prices and relative price weakness of other products, especially gasoline, is pressuring profit margins.</p>
<p>Gross margins for primary processing, or the first stage of refining, are around 60 cents a barrel, while complex processing margins are a dollar higher, one refiner said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's difficult to cover costs,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Traders said despite the shutdowns of two Indonesian refineries between September and November, the country's diesel imports have been steady at around two million barrels.</p>
<p>Chinese buyers, returning to the market on Thursday after a three-day holiday, were likely to be put off by the sudden price spike during their absence.</p>
<p>Last week China was bidding around $218 a tonne c&amp;f of diesel, but sellers were not expected to offer below $220.</p>
<p>Traders said the reemergence of smuggling in southern China has cut purchases from the international market.</p>
<p>India, the other big buyer of diesel, has shown little demand over the past three months and even cancelled its tender for November barrels to try to help clear congestion at its ports.</p>
<p>Traders said the strong diesel market since early September was largely due to tensions in the Gulf, lesser Middle East exports and the constant attempt by the Asian market to catch up with the west.</p>
<p>They said despite Wednesday's record trade, Singapore prices were $20.50 a tonne under London futures prices for gas oil (diesel) compared with last year when they were $13-$14 a tonne above western prices.</p>
<p>Traders said high western prices were expected to hold for some time as Europe switches to 0.05-percent sulphur diesel from the 0.2-percent grade, starting October 1, and as winter nears.</p>
<p>The change is tightening supplies as refiners there switch to producing lower sulphur diesel, while the higher sulphur material is being blended with kerosene, which is also in demand, traders said. But since refinery upgradings were already underway, stocks should soon return to normal, they added.</p>
