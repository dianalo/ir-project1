<title>NEW ZEALAND: Contributions to pension schemes rising - NZ's LOA.</title>
<headline>Contributions to pension schemes rising - NZ's LOA.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-11-25</dateline>

<p>Regular contributions into superannuation schemes rose by around 20 percent in the September year, The Life Office Association said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Releasing its 1996 Statistical Review, the LOA said single premiums or lump sum contributions for superannuation were up 60 percent for the September year, at NZ$284 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Over $524 million per year is being invested into superannuation schemes managed by life offices,&quot; association chief executive Arthur Davis said.  </p>
<p>He said a Reserve Bank of New Zealand survey showed life offices continued to be the dominant manager of superannuation funds, with more than $6.5 billion under management. Banks followed next with $3.8 billion.</p>
<p>Davis said there had been a dramatic increase of nearly 50 percent in the investment income of life offices in the June year, and a rise of 23 percent in the September year showed those levels were being sustained.</p>
<p>However, traditional life insurance business in force showed a slight reduction for the June year, which Davis said was in line with world wide trends.  </p>
<p>In August this year the LOA announced it would join with the Investment Funds Association of New Zealand to form a new organisation, the Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand. The new association will represent the life insurance, superannuation and managed funds industry.</p>
<p>Davis said it was expected the new association would continue to collect statistics on life insurance activity to ensure the series was maintained.</p>
