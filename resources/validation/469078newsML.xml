<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates ended off 15 basis points at a session low of 21.25 percent on Wednesday as early speculation eased, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market came under pressure this morning from those who were liquid and wish to buy paper at good rates prior to the long weekend,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Overnight Cetes rates reached a high of 21.65 percent in early trade.</p>
<p>Mexican financial markets will close on Thursday and Friday, March 27 and 28, to celebrate Easter.  </p>
<p>Other traders noted that secondary rates also came under upside pressure from the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond, which was down 8/32 to yield 6.99 percent in late trade.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile opened down 20 basis points at 22.55 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing out of the ordinary happened, the session was quiet. Every one just wanted to get away early and closed their books this morning. They grabbed their cash, paper, squared positions and off they went,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico drained 2.431 billion pesos from the market through five secondary market auctions, which it assigned at rates of between 22.54 and 22.85 percent.</p>
<p>Liquidity of 4.282 xillion pesos was scheduled to return to the system from prior central bank participation.</p>
