<p>Boris Nemtsov, a liberal named first deputy premier by President Boris Yeltsin, said on Monday he was ready for unpopular decisions to force through reforms, including telling ministers to dump their foreign cars.</p>
<p>&quot;I will not tell lies, I will not take bribes or steal, I will explain to people everything I do, even the most unpleasant things,&quot; Nemtsov, 37, governor of Nizhny Novgorod region, told Russian Public television.</p>
<p>As he left an executive jet in his home city of Nizhny Novgorod on the Volga river, 400 km (250 miles) east of Moscow, he said he had abandoned earlier refusals of a government job because he was impressed by Yeltsin's commitment to giving a new start to Russia's stalled free market reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;Only one thing could change my mind -- the president's will,&quot; he said. &quot;The president is full of committment to restore order. We will do this together.&quot;</p>
<p>Nemtsov, whose efforts at market reform at a local level secured him comfortable re-election as governor last year, described his new task -- kickstarting a painful overhaul of the welfare state -- as &quot;suicidal&quot;.</p>
<p>He agreed to join the government only after Yeltsin promised to him the right to hire and fire any officials under him and vowed to back him up on the difficult decisions to come.</p>
<p>&quot;The president will back me even in the unpopular decisions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nemtsov said one of his first acts would be to force government officials from their foreign cars and put them back in Russian-made marques -- Nizhny Novgorod's GAZ factory produces the ubiquitous Volga sedan.</p>
<p>&quot;All officials should switch to home-produced cars. This will be one of our first decisions,&quot; he said. &quot;Enough riding Mercedes, Rolls Royces and so on.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he had already discussed the matter with Yeltsin, who himself uses a German Mercedes.</p>
<p>Nemtsov also said he would work well with fellow reformist first deputy prime minister Anatoly Chubais, 41.</p>
<p>&quot;I met Chubais, we will work together and I hope we will work in team,&quot; he said. &quot;We have good working relations.&quot;</p>
