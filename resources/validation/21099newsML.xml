<p>Two mixed superplus/Eurograde cargoes were thought available out of Italy, one containing low benzene Eurograde material.</p>
<p>Naphtha was relatively tight. Various players were seen seeking N+A product but little activity was heard about.</p>
<p>Gas oil was firmer. There was a fair amount talk over low sulphur ahead the introduction 0.05 percent sulphur on regulations on October 1 approaches.</p>
<p>Premiums were put at anything between +$8 to $12 over 0.2 percent prices. While most Med-based refiners remain confident they can meet requirements traders outside of the region were sceptical</p>
<p>On the Russian material front, traders said there was talk of premiums of quotes cif high +$1.50/+$2.50, basis Genoa.</p>
<p>Good quality fuel oil of bunker spec remains tight with shortages in Italy and Spain. There was only a small parcel out of Augusta on the supply side and the two ISAB cargoes available in second half September will not be of sufficient quality.</p>
<p>A trader was understood to have split a 50,000 tonne high sulphur cracked cargo with 10-15,000 tonnes heading into Gibralter and around 35,000 tonnes sold into Tunisia. An unconfirmed price was cif high cif Med +$2/3. An ISAB cargo was also sold at high fob Med +$1 for end September loading.</p>
