<p>Romania's anti-Communist opposition is poised to take control of government after a resounding general election victory but tough negotiations remain ahead to form a workable coalition.</p>
<p>With official results reported from nearly three-quarters of Romania's 15,000 polling stations, the centrist Democratic Convention (CDR) had some 30 percent of the vote, thrashing the ex-Communists of president Ion Iliescu, with 23 percent.</p>
<p>It remained unclear who would emerge as president. Iliescu led a field of 16 in Sunday's voting with 33 percent and went through to a November 17 run-off with the CDR's leader, professor Emil Constantinescu.</p>
<p>The Convention, which has accused Iliescu's cautious reforms of creating mass poverty, was euphoric about turfing his Party of Social Democracy (PDSR) out of office and implementing its &quot;Contract with Romania&quot; of faster reforms.</p>
<p>Its most likely coalition partner is former Prime Minister Petre Roman, third in the presidential race with 20 percent.</p>
<p>But the Convention made it clear it expected Roman to endorse Constantinescu in the run-off round for the presidency as the price of allowing it into government.</p>
<p>&quot;First we must have concrete support for the presidential campaign,&quot; CDR campaign manager Remus Opris told state television. &quot;That is a key element to strengthen our relations and help negotations on a coalition.&quot;</p>
<p>Constantinescu's relations with Roman are cool at best.</p>
<p>He attacked Roman in the campaign, demanding explanations for &quot;serious errors&quot; during 22 months in office in the aftermath of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's 1989 execution.</p>
<p>But the CDR's options are limited as it has rejected outright any alliance with Iliescu's PDSR.</p>
<p>The only other groups clearing the three percent minimum barrier into parliament are a party representing 1.6 million ethnic Hungarians and two extreme nationalist parties.</p>
<p>Constantinescu received support in the presidential run-off from an unexpected quarter -- one of the two nationalists, Gheorghe Funar, the mayor of the Transylvanian city of Cluj, accused of curbing the rights of the Hungarian minority.</p>
<p>&quot;If I have to choose between two evils, let it be Constantinescu,&quot; he told private ProTV television.</p>
<p>Other coalition combinations remain possible, including a minority CDR government relying on tactical support from Roman's Social Democrats and the Hungarian party.</p>
<p>Analysts warned that a CDR-led government would have to abandon populist promises and take unpopular measures to kick-start the weak Romanian economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The new government will have to rebalance the economy by restructuring, allowing prices to rise and accepting a further depreciation of the leu (currency), independent economist Ilie Serbanescu told Reuters.</p>
<p>Iliescu's opponents say his cautious approach to reforms plunged millions of Romanians into poverty and left the country well behind its neighbours opting for a fast-track approach to the market -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.</p>
