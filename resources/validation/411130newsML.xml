<p>Luxury retailer Barney's Inc said Friday it had not yet reviewed with its advisers a takeover offer from Dickson Concepts (International) Ltd of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Barney's, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year, said Dickson's proposal was &quot;to invest in the company as part of Barney's recapitalization&quot; under a company-sponsored plan of reorganization.</p>
<p>Dickson, an upmarket retailer, offered current Barney's ownbers $240 million cash and a minority stake in Barney's non-U.S. store licensing income.  </p>
<p>Barney's said it has had &quot;numerous discussions&quot; with Dickson and its various representatives regarding elements of a potential investment proposal.</p>
<p>It said it did not receive Dickson's formal takeover proposal until early this morning and has not had a chance to review the offer with its financial and legal advisers.</p>
<p>Barney's said it had anticipated the Dickson proposal as part of the Hong Kong company's completion of a &quot;due diligence&quot; review of the Barney's books and records.  </p>
<p>Barney's said it has been involved in talks with potential investors as part of its efforts to develop a reorganization plan that maximizes its value.</p>
<p>Barney's emphasized that it retains the exclusive right to file or advance such a plan.</p>
