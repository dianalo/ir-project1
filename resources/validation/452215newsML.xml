<headline>SOCCER-FIORENTINA INTEND TO STAY SILENT BUT DEADLY.</headline>

<p>Fiorentina, who have been silent in the Italian league for most of the season, should display the killer touch against Portugal's Benfica in the European Cup Winners' Cup on Thursday.</p>
<p>The unsettled and embattled Italians, surrounded by ever increasing criticism from their fiery fans as well as the media, take a 2-0 lead into the home leg of the quarter-final and will surely keep the Portuguese at arm's length.</p>
<p>Benfica's morale is also low, their confidence hardly helped by a 4-3 loss at home to Salgueiros in a Portuguese league match on Sunday when their leaky defence allowed in two goals in the last two minutes.</p>
<p>But if as forecast Fiorentina reach the semifinals of a competition they won in the very first year of its existence in 1961, expect little enlightenment from the team.</p>
<p>The players, including Argentine star striker Gabriel Batistuta, have retreated behind a wall of silence with a protest press blackout since late last year.</p>
<p>The club, which started the season with high expectations after winning the Italian Cup for their first trophy in 21 years, have underperformed more than anyone feared.</p>
<p>They have lost their last two serie A matches, going down 2-0 to AC Milan on Saturday, and are 12th. The Cup Winners' Cup looks their only route back into Europe.</p>
<p>Club owner and media magnate Vittorio Cecchi Gori, dissatisfied with the way his investment has performed, wrote an open letter to the team that was published in the local Florence paper and which offered a clear warning.</p>
<p>&quot;If you let us down, then like betrayed lovers we will find it hard to pardon you,&quot; he wrote. &quot;You are champions, there is no room for indifference or calculations.&quot;</p>
<p>The fans have turned against several players, notably Brazilian-born Belgian Luis Oliveira. Even Batistuta was the target for some abuse on Sunday. Newspapers reported he stopped his car and wound the window down to remonstrate.</p>
<p>&quot;Why are you attacking me? I'm doing all I can for the team,&quot; the Argentine told the group of fans.</p>
<p>Oliveira looks doubtful with a twisted left ankle, but coach Claudio Ranieri has striker Francesco Baiano back and goalkeeper Francesco Toldo is recovering fast from a cold.</p>
<p>Midfielder Sandro Cois is suspended, while Russian winger Andreij Kanchelskis is cup-tied.</p>
<p>Baiano will partner Batistuta in attack while Anselmo Robbiati and Giovanni Piacentini return to midfield alongside former Benfica team mates Stefan Schwarz of Sweden and Portuguese international Manuel Rui Costa.</p>
<p>Benfica have no reported injury problems.</p>
<p>Teams:</p>
<p>Fiorentina (probable) - Francesco Toldo; Vittorio Pusceddu, Giulio Falcone, Pasquale Padalino, Daniele Carnasciale, Rui Costa, Giovanni Piacentini, Stefan Schwarz, Anselmo Robbiati, Francesco Baiano, Gabriel Batistuta.</p>
<p>Benfica (probable) - Michel Preud'Homme; Jose Calado, Jorge Soares, Jorge Bermudez, Hadrioui, Tahar El Kalej, Bruno Caires, Valdo Filho, Edgar Pacheco, Joao Pinto, Mauro Airez.</p>
