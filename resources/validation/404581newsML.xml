<p>New York Gov. George Pataki said Wednesday the state will get an even bigger windfall by the time its fiscal year ends on March 31 than he first estimated, but it would not be as much as $2 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it might be higher than the $1.3 billion we were talking about but I don't think that's the number,&quot; he told reporters in Albany, when asked if the surplus would be as big as $2 billion. The $2 billion estimate has been put forward by some legislative sources, who declined to be named.  </p>
<p>Pataki took much of the credit for the improvement in the state's finances, which has gotten a big boost from surging profits at Wall Street banks and brokerage houses, a sector that last year earned an estimated $11.5 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's a very positive sign that we have been controlling, in all seriousness, the cost of state government. And we are seeing economic growth, investment and confidence in New York State, that we haven't seen for a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>The Republican governor did not appear to have decided precisely how the extra funds will be used. &quot;I would hope that at most we would use it for a one-time expenditure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's why I said it's very important that we look at long-term structural balances as we look at any additional revenues that are there, and not simply say that we can balance the budget this year,&quot; he said.</p>
