<title>UK: LIFFE cocoa remains under siege after fund sell-off.</title>
<headline>LIFFE cocoa remains under siege after fund sell-off.</headline>

<p>Cocoa was nursing its wounds on Thursday after a raid on Wednesday that left players with extremely bleak technical prospects.</p>
<p>Benchmark May futures absorbed more selling as it fell to a new contract low and an 18-month low on second month continuation.</p>
<p>Traders said weak price levels tempted some buyers, but industry were only prepared to commit for scale-down purchases and with more sellers waiting in the wings, 850 stg looked to be a reasonable downside target to expect.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a fair volume of selling but people don't want to buy the selling,&quot; said one. &quot;There is a reluctance to pay up.&quot;</p>
<p>May cocoa stumbled to an intraday low of 871 stg initially but managed to trim its losses at the close, ending seven stg down at 873 stg a tonne. At one stage it even moved to positive territory.</p>
<p>&quot;Some support may be found at around 880 but new targets can be set at 850 for the slightly longer term,&quot; said analyst Elli Gifford of Investment Research.</p>
<p>She recommended stops on shorts be put at 900 stg basis May.</p>
<p>Thursday's volume was a strong 12,660 lots which included a substantial amount of switches across the board. March/May traded at 23 stg after close to 30 stg on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Funds, put off by gloomy charts, continued to expand shorts, but trade houses were on both sides of the market. Origins were selling to tap higher margins created by sterling's strength in European crosses, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders continued to blame sterling for reversing cocoa's fortunes this week after a blip to 938 stg on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Currency is the scariest bit,&quot; commented one trader.</p>
<p>But other analysts pointed at the latest West African cocoa arrivals, which showed no sign of tailing off this week, for injecting a chill.</p>
