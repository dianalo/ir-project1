<p>Japan's Sumitomo Corp, which one year ago sent shock waves through the financial world by revealing massive copper trading losses, has largely returned to business as usual, albeit with a damaged corporate image.</p>
<p>And a greyer-haired Yasuo Hamanaka, Sumitomo's former star copper trader, is now appearing in Tokyo court, facing fraud and forgery charges which could put him in jail for up to 15 years.</p>
<p>&quot;We ran into the red in the last business year for the first time, and our copper sales plunged, but the other departments are doing well and there's no serious impact now,&quot; a Sumitomo Corp spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On May 20, Sumitomo announced that it posted losses in the last business year, which ended on March 31, for the first time since the giant trade house was founded in 1919.</p>
<p>Sumitomo said an internal inquiry into its copper losses is still going on and it is fully cooperating with U.S. and British authorities, but it has not yet decided whether to make the results of its in-house probe public.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as the trial is going on, we'd like to make no comment on the case,&quot; the company spokesman said.</p>
<p>Despite the business-as-usual attitude, however, the copper market losses, which Sumitomo estimated at $2.6 billion, have not been entirely painless for Sumitomo's employees.</p>
<p>The company has proposed to its labour union that summer bonuses for all employees be cut this year as the trade house attempts to pull up its socks.</p>
<p>&quot;Our top management and the (non-ferrous) metal department should be blamed for their lax controls and the huge losses. Why should other sections share the burden?&quot; said a junior manager in Sumitomo's grain department.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former star trader Hamanaka, nicknamed &quot;Mr Five Percent&quot; and &quot;Mr Copper&quot; for his influence in the global market until he was fired last June, continues to appear in Tokyo District Court.</p>
<p>He has already pleaded guilty to charges of fraud and forgery in connection with unauthorised trades that Sumitomo blames for the $2.6 billion loss.</p>
<p>Despite the guilty plea, his defence lawyers have said they hope to achieve a lighter sentence for their client by demonstrating that lax checks and controls at Sumitomo were partly to blame for the huge loss.</p>
<p>Toru Yoshiki, one of the lawyers on Hamanaka's defence team, said: &quot;There's a possibility that Sumitomo could have stopped Hamanaka's unauthorised deals if its system of checks and controls was working properly.&quot;</p>
<p>During the five hearings held so far in his trial, which began in February, the defence team has continued to grill senior officials from Sumitomo's credit control section. The Tokyo District Court is likely to pass judgment on Hamanaka by early next year, Yoshiki said.</p>
<p>The lawyer also quoted Hamanaka as denying any manipulation of the world copper market. &quot;If somebody accuses him of manipulating copper prices, they would have to prove that such was his intention,&quot; Yoshiki said.</p>
<p>Since his release from the Tokyo Detention Centre in February, Hamanaka, 49, has been living quietly with his family in his modest two-storey house in a middle-class suburb of Tokyo.</p>
<p>Despite the swirl of publicity around him, Hamanaka is maintaining his silence.</p>
<p>A long-time friend of Hamanaka said she recently received a postcard from him. &quot;He was so sorry to worry us, and stressed that he and his family are doing well,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;But Yasuo didn't mention the scandal in the postcard at all. It may be better to leave him alone for a while.&quot;</p>
