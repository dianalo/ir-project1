<title>USA: Five escape fiery FedEx plane crash at Newark.</title>
<headline>Five escape fiery FedEx plane crash at Newark.</headline>
<dateline>NEWARK, N.J. 1997-07-31</dateline>

<p>Five people miraculously walked away virtually unscathed from a Federal Express cargo plane that crash-landed, overturned and burst into flames at Newark airport early Thursday, officials said.</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon, pieces of the charred, smoky aircraft lay scattered across a runway, destroyed in the impact and fire. The burning plane came to a halt about 200 yards (183 metres) from an airport terminal and the fuselage was missing both wings and the tail section.</p>
<p>National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator John Goglia told reporters at Newark International Airport that one of the flight recorders had been found, but not yet removed from the plane.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears to me to be a fuel fire, there's many thousands of gallons on an airplane even at the end of its trip and there is a strong smell of kerosene all over the place,&quot; Goglia said.</p>
<p>The cause of the crash, which happened at 1:35 a.m. EDT (0535 GMT), could not be immediately known, Goglia said.</p>
<p>The airport, one of the busiest in the United States, had two of its three runways open for arrivals and departures by Thursday afternoon. Passengers were being delayed for up to several hours and many flights were cancelled, said a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</p>
<p>The two crew members and three passengers crawled to safety through a cockpit window, Port Authority spokesman Allen Morrison said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very hard landing,&quot; Morrison said. &quot;The plane, on impact, flipped over and began to burn.</p>
<p>&quot;They all walked away from it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Federal Express said in a statement the five people aboard the plane were taken to Elizabeth General Hospital in nearby Elizabeth, N.J., treated for minor injuries and released.</p>
<p>Company spokesman Greg Rossiter identified the two crew members as Captain Robert Freeman and First Officer Donald Goodin. The other people on the plane were two FedEx employees and an employee of another airline.</p>
<p>The passengers were in &quot;jump seats&quot;, which are reserved for business or pleasure travel for FedEx employees or employees of other airlines.</p>
<p>&quot;Without very, very fast response on the part of police officers who are also our fire safety people this could have been a real tragedy,&quot; said Robert Boyle, executive director of the Port Authority.</p>
<p>The company said Federal Express Flight 14, an MD-11F aircraft, was en route from Anchorage, Alaska and carrying international freight to be delivered in the United States.</p>
<p>It said the flight contained about 145,000 pounds (65,770 kgs) of revenue payload, including less than 400 pounds (181 kgs) of &quot;routine hazardous materials&quot; that the company is accustomed to carrying.</p>
<p>Federal Express is the world's biggest cargo airline, carrying 3.77 million scheduled freight tonnes in 1996, ahead of Lufthansa with 2.88 million tonnes, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).</p>
<p>Federal Express, which has 23 MD-11s in its fleet, is also the biggest U.S. domestic cargo carrier, with 2.97 million tonnes last year, ahead of UPS with 2.60 million.</p>
