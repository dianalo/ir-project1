<title>USA: KCBT wheat ends lower, July posts broad losses.</title>
<headline>KCBT wheat ends lower, July posts broad losses.</headline>

<p>KCBT hard red winter wheat futures settled lower and new crop contracts posted broad losses amid fund- and technical-related selling, traders said.</p>
<p>Early fund-related selling in July wheat triggered sell-stops, which pushed the market sharply lower at the midsession. A late bout of short covering helped erase some earlier losses, but the rally lost steam and the July contract tumbled four cents in the session's final five minutes.</p>
<p>Traders said various forecasts for much-needed rain next week in dry areas of western Kansas and eastern Colorado weighed on the July contract.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw fund-selling early and then stops were hit,&quot; a trader said. &quot;It's also a little bearish if we get rain next week (in western Kansas) as is being forecast.&quot;</p>
<p>KCBT wheat settled 1/2 to 12 cents per bushel lower, and July traded in a 16-1/2 cent range before closing down 12 cents at $4.16-1/4.</p>
<p>Strong cash basis bids for old crop wheat helped limit losses in the May contract. May settled down three cents at $4.55.</p>
<p>Brokerage house Refco, which has ties to fund holdings, was easily the session's featured player. Traders said Refco sold six million KCBT July bushels, and ADM's Benson-Quinn Commodities sold four million July and one million September.</p>
