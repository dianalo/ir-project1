<p>Britain's Labour government said on Monday its new, constructive approach to Europe was already bearing fruit, with a deal on job creation and signs European states were about to agree to London's demands to keep its border controls.</p>
<p>After just one day of a two-day European summit -- the first full summit attended by Tony Blair as Prime Minister -- Britain appeared to be in the unusual position of getting its own way.</p>
<p>Even France and Germany, doughty opponents who regularly locked horns with former Conservative premier John Major and his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, were complimentary.</p>
<p>&quot;(Chancellor of the Exchequer) Gordon Brown was very helpful,&quot; French finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn told reporters. &quot;I want to thank him very much.&quot;</p>
<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel, while being carefully diplomatic, also hailed the change in tone ushered in by Labour's landslide victory in the May 1 election.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be unfair to say that I can work better with Tony Blair or Gordon Brown,&quot; he told a news conference. &quot;But it has paid off that I spent at least as much time with Gordon Brown (before the election) than all other socialist policy makers put together.&quot;</p>
<p>What Britain is claiming so far is agreement on a pact to promote jobs without any softening of the strict economic criteria for countries who wish to join the European Union's single currency, due to start in 1999.</p>
<p>Blair has said it is &quot;highly unlikely&quot; Britain will join in 1999, but he wants to keep open the option of joining later -- a policy he says is genuine compared to the previous Conservative government which was being pushed into a harder line by anti Europeans in the divided party.</p>
<p>Britain also seems on course to win the &quot;watertight&quot; legal protection for its border controls as other European states move to harmonise their frontier regulations.</p>
<p>British officials said they also expect a letter from the Commission promising a tougher line on quota-hoppers -- Spanish fishermen who have bought up British fishing quotas and take their catches to Spain.</p>
<p>British officials gleefully pointed out that the language of opt-outs and vetos had not been used by Blair to secure agreements which the defeated Conservatives had failed to reach despite threats.</p>
<p>But, resisting the temptation to crow about their achievements or to score points off other European states, Britain's Europe Minister, Doug Henderson, said the deal was a &quot;balanced, a measured agreement&quot;.</p>
<p>Some tensions remain.</p>
<p>The new administrations of both France and Britain, vying for the European spotlight after their decisive election victories, both claimed original authorship of the jobs pact.</p>
<p>But British officials dismissed media reports of strained relations between Blair and France's new premier Lionel Jospin.</p>
<p>And other nations began to see a glimmer of hope that easier days were ahead.</p>
<p>One British official, who asked to remain anonymous, quoted Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm as saying: &quot;Having France and Britain agreeing with each other means we can get things done.&quot;</p>
