<p>Hungarian chemicals company Tiszai Vegyi Kombinat Rt (TVK)'s handicaps would be offset by relatively cheap production in the second half of 1996, ING Barings said in a report, rating the shares as &quot;accumulate&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;TVK's cost advantage, which is partly due to its low energy costs...should offset the company's twin drawbacks - its relatively small-scale plants and the higher transportation costs to western Europe during the second half of 1996,&quot; ING Barings' Budapest-based analyst Barna Papay said in the report.</p>
<p>TVK's 1996 first half results slightly surpassed expectations, with net earnings of 5.4 billion forints on revenues of 31.1 billion forints, the report, published in the September issue of ING Barings' &quot;Eastern European Equity Insights,&quot; said.</p>
<p>However, &quot;margins were somewhat tighter due to the high average price of naphta,&quot; Papay said.</p>
<p>A 28.3 percent year-on-year energy price rise was the other factor that squeezed margins, the report said, adding that the gross margin for the full year is expected to improve to around 33.9 percent from 29.3 percent in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>The company remains vulnerable to the olefin cycle &quot;as the olefin and polyolefin plants generate approximately 95 percent of TVK's gross profit,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>These plants, however, should become more profitable in the medium term, due to reorganisation, focus on distribution and shift to higher added-value products.</p>
<p>On the Budapest Stock Exchange TVK shares closed unchanged at 1,345 forints.</p>
