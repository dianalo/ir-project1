<p>French travel company Nouvelles Frontieres and Alexandre Courvelaire, the president of French carrier AOM, are studying offers for troubled Air Liberte to block a bid by British Airways, the newspaper Le Monde reported in its Thursday edition.</p>
<p>It said Jacques Maillot, president of Nouvelles Frontieres and charter airline Corsair, &quot;may seek to play the white knight and buy both AOM and Air Liberte&quot;, while Courvelaire may form a bidding group to buy the two companies. AOM is held by the state agency Consortium de Realisation (CDR), which groups the assets of state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais to be sold off.</p>
<p>British Airways, which has a foothold in France through its French carrier TAT, has expressed an interest in acquiring Air Liberte, merging it with TAT and investing the money needed to make the entity viable. Last week it asked Europe's Transport and Competition commissioners to block any bid by AOM to acquire Air Liberte, saying it would be an illegal use of state aid.</p>
<p>CDR was created as part of a state bailout of the bank.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm seriously looking at the AOM and Air Liberte dossiers and will take a decision soon,&quot; Maillot was quoted as saying in Le Monde. The newspaper said he would drop Air Liberte's routes to France's overseas territories. They are served by Corsair.</p>
<p>Bids for Air Liberte, which was placed under bankruptcy protection by a Paris court on September 26, are due by October 14.</p>
<p>Le Monde said French Prime Minister Alain Juppe told the Finance Ministry, which oversees the CDR, to back &quot;a national solution&quot;.</p>
<p>Before Air Liberte was placed under creditor protection, its chairman Lotfi Belhassine was in merger talks with AOM chairman Courvelaire but the two could not find common ground.</p>
<p>French domestic airlines, such as AOM, Air Liberte and Air France's Air Inter -- renamed Air France Europe-- are engaged in a bitter price war following liberalisation on some key routes in France ahead of a full opening up of the market.</p>
