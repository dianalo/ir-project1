<text>
<p>Mace Security International Inc said Monday three of its board members have disclosed that they have entered a voting pact covering more than 50 percent of the company's outstanding stock.</p>
<p>The members include Chairman Jon Goodrich, who has a 29.2 percent stake on the company, and director Robert Gould, who has a 27 percent stake.</p>
<p>The company had said in August that some of its top executives were negotiating a sale of their stakes, which represent a controlling interest in the company, to a competitor.</p>
<p>The company did not immediately return calls for further comment.</p>
<p>Mace said additionally that five board members, including company president Robert Norman, have resigned.  It said Norman is being replaced by Marvin Brown, a former executive for a New York-based investment group.</p>
