<p>Firmer crude helped propel high sulphur cracked fuel oil up $2, but low sulphur was unable to capitalise because of long positions, traders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Good bunker demand helped push barge prices several dollars higher with early deals done at $123 fob ARA, ($124 fob Rotterdam). Prices eased in the afternoon with to peg barges around $120-121 fob.</p>
<p>Bunker demand was estimated as high as 30,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been a lot of volume and I think we may have stronger numbers again tomorrow as people try and cover themselves over Christmas,&quot; said one barge trader.</p>
<p>The high sulphur cargo market rose up on the back of barges to about $116-118 cif NWE, but activity was quiet.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not tight, but it's not exactly awash,&quot; said one player who had secured product last week.</p>
<p>The low sulphur market took little comfort from Electricite de France's tender to buy 36,000 tonnes for January. &quot;It's split up into little parcels - 10kt here, 25kt there, 5kt down there,&quot; said one trader, adding &quot;It's too fragemented to give support.&quot; An early Jan 25kt cargo was heard offered at $127.50 fob NWE while a 45-50kt end month cargo was looking for $130 fob NWE.</p>
