<p>A stronger-than-expected &quot;tankan&quot; survey of Japanese corporate sentiment took financial markets by surprise on Wednesday, boosting the yen amid fresh speculation about a rise in interest rates.</p>
<p>While a sizable chunk of Asian offshore debt is denominated in yen and was taken on when the yen was much lower than it is at present, the benefits of a stronger Japanese economy and the help it will give to the region as whole outweighs the downside of a more expensive debt burden, analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;In the short-term a stronger yen won't help and yes they do owe Japan a lot of money, but I believe that a strong currency and turn-up in the Japanese economy is going to help the region as a whole,&quot; said Tim Lucas, treasury manager at Bank of Bermuda in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the day Asian regional countries are going to benefit more from the economic boost Japanese growth will give to the region. If Japan falls by the wayside it's going to drag everyone else down.&quot;  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, market talk was for a weaker than previously expected survey so the plus seven figure for the key index of business confidence, compared with market forecasts ranging from minus four to plus four, came as something of a surprise.</p>
<p>The currency reaction was striking with both dollar/yen and dollar/mark, both immediately sinking around a yen.</p>
<p>The official discount rate (ODR), which the Bank of Japan charges on overnight loans to commercial banks, is currently at a record low of just 0.5 percent.  </p>
<p>In the wake of the strong survey analysts reckon the ODR could rise as early as the third quarter, but others are looking toward the end of the year.</p>
<p>Analysts said the biggest impact of a higher yen in terms of debt would be on Indonesia, and after that Malaysia, although to a significantly lesser degree. They said around 40 pecent of Indonesia's offshore debt was denominated in yen.</p>
<p>But with current account deficits a problem around the Asian region, a strengthening of the Japanese economy is bullish in terms of investment flows.  </p>
<p>&quot;If there was a regional interest rate, ex-Japan, it would be higher than anywhere else in the world and the Japanese are going to want to access that,&quot; Bank of Bermuda's Lucas said.</p>
<p>On top of this, if Japanese flows grow on the back of a better economic performance they are more likely to remain in Asia.</p>
<p>Uncertainty over European monetary union, and the fact that many investors are starting to have fits of vertigo about the lofty levels U.S. asset markets have achieved of late, will tend to put off long-term Japanese investors.  </p>
<p>&quot;The crucial thing is that we don't get a long drawn-out strengthening of the yen like we did a couple of years ago,&quot; said Chiang Yao Chye, economist at CIBC Wood Gundy in Singapore.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as that situation doesn't repeat itself I think Japanese investors will be going into the Asian region and looking for yield.&quot;</p>
<p>Moreover, the flipside to a stronger yen is an easier dollar and in the case of Thailand's ongoing baht crisis this can only be good news.  </p>
<p>&quot;In the case of Thailand, if the dollar weakens further there is less of a case for people to say the baht is overvalued,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;For some parts of the region there is a good side to this number in the short-term in terms of the currency.&quot;</p>
