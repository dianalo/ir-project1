<headline>SOCCER-BRANCO OF 1994 WORLD CUP FAME, TO PLAY FOR METRO STARS.</headline>
<dateline>EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey 1997-07-20</dateline>

<p>Brazilian defender Branco, who played in the last three World Cups, signed a contract with Major League Soccer on Sunday and was assigned to the New York/New Jersey Metro Stars for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>Branco, 33, whose full name is Claudio Ibraim Vaz Leal, is expected to make his debut against D.C. United next Sunday, if the league can have his visa approved in time.</p>
<p>Branco is probably best known for his 35-yard free kick that lifted Brazil to a 3-2 victory over The Netherlands in the 81st minute of the World Cup quarterfinals in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a new challenge for me,&quot; Branco said. &quot;I have played in many different leagues and have gained valuable experience. It's a new experience, so I will learn something here too.&quot;</p>
<p>Branco has played in the top leagues of Italy, Britain, Portugal and Brazil, but has not played competitively for two months.</p>
<p>&quot;I have known Branco since he is 19 years old and I believe he would be a great player for the Metro Stars and the league,&quot; Metro Stars' coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said. &quot;His experience would go a long way in helping the young American players.&quot;</p>
