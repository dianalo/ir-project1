<p>New entrants in the Philippine oil industry are expected to invest at least 7.69 billion pesos in the coming years, officials from the new oil companies said on Thursday.</p>
<p>About 5.0 billion pesos would be invested in the next two years, mostly to build gasoline stations, the officials told reporters after calling on Energy Secretary Francisco Viray.</p>
<p>The local RFV Group of Companies said it would invest 2.7 billion pesos for its venture into the oil industry. It would participate in all segments of the downstream oil industry, except refining.</p>
<p>RFV chief executive officer Ramon Villavicencio said his company would set up subsidiaries to operate its distribution and bulk marketing network, storage facilities and liquefied petroleum gas refilling plants.</p>
<p>&quot;In the next five years, we expect to be competing toe-to-toe with the big players. But for now, our aim is to establish a decent market share,&quot; Villavicencio said.</p>
<p>PTT Philippines Inc, the local subsidiary of Petroleum Authority of Thailand, said it is spending 2.25 billion pesos in the next five years to put up 150 gasoline stations.</p>
<p>PTT vice president Somchai Jiranuntarat said its gasoline stations would be located in the northern Luzon island.</p>
<p>Local firm Unioil Philippines Inc said it would allocate 1.1 billion pesos to put up five gasoline stations, storage facilities and LPG bulk marketing facilities in the country.</p>
