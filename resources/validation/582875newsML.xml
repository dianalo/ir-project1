<headline>CBOT corn closes lower on sharp break in soybeans.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-14</dateline>

<p>A sharp drop in soybean futures plus overall good crop weather in the U.S. Midwest pressed CBOT corn futures to a lower close, traders said.</p>
<p>Active speculative selling led the way down with several key managed fund accounts combining to sell roughly 18 million bushels of corn futures, traders said.</p>
<p>The market also was pressed by aggressive corn seeding in the U.S. Midwest and by routine exports of U.S. corn, traders said.</p>
<p>USDA Monday reported U.S. corn seedings as of Sunday at a level well above a year ago and above average and rapid corn plantings were expected this week, traders said.</p>
<p>Thursday's USDA weekly export sales report was expected to show net U.S. corn sales at 300,000 to 600,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch Futures sold 4.5 million bushels of July, Rosenthal Collins sold three million July and Cargill Inc sold 5.5 million bushels of July, traders said. Griffin Trading sold three million bushels of December and FIMAT Futures sold five million bushels of December, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn closed 3/4 to 3-1/2 cents per bushel lower, with May down 3-1/2 at $2.85-3/4. July was down one at $2.83-1/2 and December was down one at $2.65-3/4.  </p>
<p>In spread trading, Lind Waldock did two million July/September at 15-3/4 cents, Goldenberg Hehmeyer did 1.5 million July/December at 19 cents and Refco Inc spread one million July/December at 18-1/2 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 65,000 contracts, below the 73,123 traded Tuesday.</p>
<p>In corn options, Lind Waldock sold 1,100 July $2.90 puts at 12 to 12-1/2 cents, Cargill Investor Services bought 400 July $2.90 calls and bought 400 July $2.80 puts at 6-1/4 cents and Goldenberg Hehmeyer bought 200 July $3.40 calls at 5/8 cent, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 16,000 contracts, below the 17,502 traded Tuesday.</p>
