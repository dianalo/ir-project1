<p>Italy's economy in 1997 will grow slower than earlier expected, weighed down by the government's tough budget and its tax for Europe, economists said.</p>
<p>A Reuter quarterly poll of 15 analysts, carried out in the week of October 7, showed average forecasts for gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 0.8 percent in 1996 and 1.5 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Three months ago, analysts forecast 1996 growth of 1.1 percent, rising to 2.0 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Latest government forecasts are for GDP growth of 0.8 percent this year and 2.0 next year. But Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio said only last week it was highly likely that 1997 GDP would be less than 2.0 percent.</p>
<p>National statistics office Istat said GDP grew one percent in the first six months of this year and third-quarter growth was expected to be basically stagnant.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi's 1997 budget, which aims to slash 62.5 trillion lire off next year's deficit, includes a &quot;tax for Europe&quot; of some 12.5 trillion lire.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly there will no longer be the expected increase in households' disposable income and consumption will feel the effects of this,&quot; said Ottavio Ricchi, economist at DRI McGraw Hill.</p>
<p>&quot;Either Italian families reduce their traditionally high rate of savings or a recovery in demand will be delayed until 1998,&quot; said Ricchi.</p>
<p>DRI forecast consumer demand growing by just 0.6 percent in 1996 and 0.7 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Paolo Casadio, economist at Credito Italiano, agreed that the budget would have a negative impact on consumption in 1997. &quot;Spending on major items will be put off,&quot; he said, pointing to the already depressed state of the domestic car market.</p>
<p>But Marco Ratti, analyst at Banca Commerciale Italiana, said next year could see &quot;a better climate of household confidence, linked to the return of the lira to the European exchange rate mechanism, which would balance the budget's negative impact.&quot;</p>
<p>BCI sees 1997 consumer demand growing 0.9 percent.</p>
<p>Ernesto Puttini, analyst at Cariplo, said stagnating consumer demand derived in part from a slowly developing trend of families to put money into private pension schemes.</p>
<p>But not all was gloom. Exports were continuing strongly thanks to the competitiveness of Italian products, added to the undoubted benefit of the lira's depreciation, Casadio said.</p>
<p>Credito Italiano, which expected an increase in investment, forecast GDP growth this year of 1.2 percent and 1.4 percent next year.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth rate is pretty good despite the poor performance of industrial production,&quot; Casadio said.</p>
<p>Latest Istat data showed industrial output fell an unadjusted 11.3 percent year-on-year in August after a 4.1 percent rise in July.</p>
<p>DRI saw GDP growth this year of just 0.7 percent, but the most pessimistic forecast was from BCI, seeing 0.5 percent this year.</p>
<p>Cariplo saw 0.9 percent growth this year, based on expectations of a rebound in industrial output towards the end of the year. For 1997 it saw 2.0 percent growth due to a Europe-wide economic recovery.</p>
