<headline>Magazine says Ovtiz having troubles at Disney.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-11-03</dateline>

<p>Michael Ovitz, who as head of the talent agency CAA was called Hollywood's most powerful man, is having a hard time settling in as president of the Walt Disney Co., Vanity Fair magazine said Sunday.</p>
<p>In an article by Bryan Burrough and Kim Masters, Ovitz is described as having lost &quot;his aura of omniscience, unlimited power and Zen-like control and (now) is perceived as a confused and diminished figure who is no longer in charge of much of anything.&quot;</p>
<p>The authors add, &quot;To hear insiders tell it, he has spent his 15-month reign as president of Disney in a frustrating limbo of bungled personnel moves, strained relationships and wasted time.&quot;</p>
<p>One former Disney executive is quoted as saying, &quot;(Ovitz) is in a goddamn snake pit and I don't know how he gets out ot it.&quot;</p>
<p>When Disney Chairman Michael Eisner made Ovtiz the company's president, the move was hailed by the film and entertainment industry as a master stroke, especially since MCA had tried under its new owner, Edgar Bronfman Jr., to make Ovtiz its chief but found his asking price too steep.</p>
<p>Vanity Fair said that despite Ovitz's rocky start, few predict his imminent departure.</p>
<p>&quot;Conventional wisdom in the industry now holds that both Eisner and Ovitz have too much at stake to let their partnership founder,&quot; the authors said, adding that a recent spate of negative articles about him was producing a blacklash of support.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem for Mike is, this company is in such good shape that there's nothing for him to do,&quot; said a long-time associate of Ovitz.</p>
