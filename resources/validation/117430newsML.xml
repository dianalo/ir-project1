<p>The Supreme Court Tuesday cleared away an obstacle to executing California death-row inmates in gas chambers by setting aside a ruling that had deemed the method cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
<p>The justices by a 7-2 vote set aside a ruling by a U.S. appeals court that California's method of execution by lethal gas violates the Constitution because inmates may not become immediately unconscious and may experience some pain.</p>
<p>The justices sent the case back to the appeals court for further review because the California legislature recently amended the law to provide for lethal injections unless the inmate requests the gas chamber.</p>
<p>Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissent joined by Justice Stephen Breyer, said the court's action will only create more unnecessary delay in the case of the two death-row inmates.</p>
<p>Stevens said the high court &quot;has exhibited a callous indifference&quot; to concerns of excessive, unconstitutional delays for death-row inmates. He added that further review was not needed because lethal injection ultimately would be used.</p>
<p>California has more than 440 inmates awaiting execution.</p>
<p>Arizona, California, Maryland, Mississippi and North Carolina all employ the gas chamber or lethal injection. Other methods of execution used by the 38 states with the death penalty include electrocution, firing squads and hanging.</p>
<p>The case before the Supreme Court had been brought in 1992 by the inmates who had been sentenced to death. They challenged the state's use of the gas chamber as unconstitutional, cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
<p>After a seven-day trial, a federal district court judge in San Francisco agreed in 1994, declaring use of the gas chamber &quot;inhumane&quot; and saying it &quot;has no place in civilised society.&quot;</p>
<p>The appeals court upheld the decision.</p>
<p>&quot;The district court's findings of extreme pain, the length of time this extreme pain lasts and the substantial risk that inmates will suffer this extreme pain for several minutes require the conclusion that execution by lethal gas is cruel and unusual,&quot; the appeals court ruled.</p>
<p>California Attorney General Daniel Lungren appealed to the Supreme Court. He argued that the ruling conflicted with numerous other decisions by state and federal courts upholding the use of lethal gas as a method of execution.</p>
<p>Thirteen other states supported California's appeal, noting that lethal gas has been used for 72 years.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that other methods of execution have been developed that may appear more desireable does not render unconstitutional a method of execution that has been used for years,&quot; the 13 states said.</p>
<p>Between 1977, a year after the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment, and 1994, nine inmates have been executed in the gas chamber, Justice Department statistics show.</p>
