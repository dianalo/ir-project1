<p>Special U.N. envoy Terje Roed Larsen, Norway's troubleshooter in the Middle East peace process, is moving back to peaceful Oslo from turbulent Israel to head a newly created portfolio for national planning.</p>
<p>Larsen was perhaps the biggest surprise of 18 ministers selected by new prime minister Thorbjoern Jagland for his Labour government which took office on Friday following the resignation of veteran politician Gro Harlem Brundtland.</p>
<p>Larsen, 48, a diplomat who helped broker the historic 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace pact and has been U.N. coordinator in Gaza for the past few years, had been expected to stay and help negotiate the current crisis between Israel and Palestinians.</p>
<p>&quot;I won't hide that the job has been tough and that there have been times when I have been worn out, but there is no connection to the crisis they are having for the moment in the Middle East (and the new position),&quot; he told reporters after taking office.</p>
<p>&quot;I am afraid the Middle East will move from crisis to crisis for many years to come and I felt I had now reached a point where it was natural for me to take on other tasks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jagland, discussing Larsen's work in the Middle East, told reporters: &quot;He has been working there for two and a half years under enormous pressure and I can understand he wants to be at home for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>Larsen said three weeks ago that vital issues in talks between Israel and the Palestinians may not be resolved before the U.S. presidential elections on November 5.</p>
<p>In an unusually blunt interview, Larsen told Norwegian television he was pessimistic about early chances for a rapprochement between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing I have learned is that the only thing you can predict in the Middle East is that nothing is predictable,&quot; he said grimly.</p>
<p>Jagland said Norway would continue to work actively to help bring about peace in the Middle East, and he assumed Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal would draw informally on Larsen's experience although the latter now would devote his time to domestic politics.</p>
<p>Some commentators said it was unwise to bring home Larsen at a time when the troubleshooter had sought to help pull the flagging Middle East peace process back on track.</p>
<p>But others said Norway's current influence in the process had been exaggerated in Norwegian newspapers and that Oslo no longer played the role it did when it supervised secret 1993 peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;Terje Roed Larsen has been good at bringing the parties together in the Middle East conflict but Norway's role is probably not as predominant as people seem to believe in this country,&quot; Ketil Volden, a researcher at peace think-tank PRIO told the daily Aftenposten.</p>
