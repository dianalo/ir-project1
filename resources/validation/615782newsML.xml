<title>USA: Judge to rule Tuesday on curbing Fla Medicaid suit.</title>
<headline>Judge to rule Tuesday on curbing Fla Medicaid suit.</headline>

<p>A Florida judge said he would rule on Tuesday on whether to slash the scope of the state of Florida's more than $1.4 billion lawsuit against tobacco companies.</p>
<p>Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge Harold Cohen heard arguments Tuesday morning on the tobacco industry's bid to reduce the number of sick smokers that Florida can claim compensation for treating. The industry wants that number cut to just 25 patients, while the state's suit seeks repayment for the Medicaid costs of treating 400,000.  </p>
<p>Earlier in the run-up to the start of an August 4 trial, the judge had given Philip Morris Cos Inc and other cigarette companies permission to examine in detail the medical records of 25 Medicaid patients. Tobacco lawyers had argued they were entitled to test the validity of the state's claims.</p>
<p>In urging Cohen to limit the number of Medicaid claimants in the suit to 25, tobacco industry attorney Murray Garnick said the court had provided tobacco companies no way to check whether Medicaid claims were legitimate.  </p>
<p>&quot;Discovery shows that fraud and abuse -- to say nothing of misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment -- run rampant in the system,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Attorneys representing Florida said the state does indeed check for fraud. &quot;The fact is that they (tobacco companies) don't want to find out the truth. They don't want to know a precise figure, because it would be something they don't want to handle,&quot; said Wayne Hogan, a Jacksonville attorney who represents Florida in the Medicaid case.</p>
<p>Mark Schlein, director of the Medicaid Fraud Control unit of the Florida attorney general's office, and Edward Turner, director of Medicaid Program Integrity for Florida, said in depositions presented to Cohen they had no idea of the full extent of fraud and abuse. There are about 1.2 million Medicaid claims filed each month in Florida.</p>
