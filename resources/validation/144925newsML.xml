<p>Brewing company Lion Nathan Ltd is expected to report flat operating earnings when it releases its result on Thursday, mostly due to market share slippage in Australia, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>Forecasts for Lion's tax-paid net profit vary because of different estimates of its tax bill, but analysts generally expect a bottom line number of around NZ$140-150 million, down from $202.3 million in the year to August, 1995.</p>
<p>At an operating level, a marginal increase over last year's profit of NZ$382 million was expected.  </p>
<p>Lion last month confirmed that its market share in Australia, where 75 percent of its operations are based, had fallen to 42.0 percent from 43.1 percent in February.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Douglas Myers has said shifts in market share were a natural occurrence in a mature market occupied by just two big players, the other being Fosters .</p>
<p>But John Cairns, head of research at Cavill White Securities, said the decline was of some concern.</p>
<p>Analysts have cited the market share question as the reason behind Lion's relative underperformance in the share market.  </p>
<p>&quot;They may say that when you get slippage in market share ... that it's just the normal functioning of a mature market, but I think that there are some things at work there that go a little deeper. Their strategy is not really paying off in both of those key markets (New South Wales and Victoria),&quot; Cairns said.</p>
<p>But Lion had identified a number of cost savings in Australia including centralising a number of brewing and sourcing functions.</p>
<p>&quot;Although we may see a bit of slippage in the volumes, their margins could still show a bit of expansion due to aggressive cost savings,&quot; Cairns said.  </p>
<p>He expects a net profit after tax of NZ$160.8 million but not much growth at the earnings before interest and tax level.</p>
<p>Lion would undoubtedly update the market on how it is faring in China, where its Wuxi brewery is up and running and another is in its construction phase in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Analysts expect Wuxi to at least break even or maybe contribute a small profit, but they said it was too early to judge whether the company had got it right in China.</p>
<p>Guy Hallright at First NZ Capital agreed the question of market share was of concern, but that he said the situation had stabilised.  </p>
<p>Lion's Pepsi franchise was not expected to show much of an improvement after reporting a loss in the first half.</p>
<p>Overall, Hallright said he expected Lion's Australian earnings to come in slightly lower than last year's and an slight improvement in New Zealand earnings.</p>
