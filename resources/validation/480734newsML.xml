<p>Blackburn's Kevin Gallacher scored twice as Scotland opened up a commanding seven point lead in World Cup qualifying group four by beat Austria 2-0 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Gallacher scored his first international goal for three and a half years to put the Scots ahead after 24 minutes at a blustery Celtic Park.</p>
<p>He then swept home a spectacular volley from the edge of the area late in the second half before leaving the pitch before the final whistle to a standing ovation from the 43,295-strong crowd.</p>
<p>Scotland have yet to concede a goal in their six World Cup matches to date. They lead the group on 14 points from Austria, who have seven points from two fewer matches.</p>
<p>But Scotland manager Craig Brown refused to accept a place in the World Cup finals was a formality.</p>
<p>&quot;We have still four games to go and there's a lot of football to be played,&quot; he said. &quot;Though we fully deserved to beat Austria tonight they're not out of it. They could afford to lose this one and qualify. If we had lost we'd have had problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown described his side's performance as their most controlled of the campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been developing a European style of play and we're getting better at keeping possession,&quot; he said. &quot;I was delighted for Kevin Gallacher who has suffered two broken legs in his career. He deserved the goals he got.&quot;</p>
<p>On 24 minutes a superb flick from Gallacher to Darren Jackson, who was in full flight down the left flank, had the white-shirted Austrians in retreat.</p>
<p>Jackson's shot was blocked by goalkeeper Michael Konsel but Jackson then managed to knock the rebound across goal for Gallacher to score.</p>
<p>Scotland's second goal came from another piece of combination play in the 77th minute.</p>
<p>Paul Lambert pushed forward on the right flank and his cross reached Gallacher, whose powerful volley swerved past Konsel into the far corner.</p>
<p>Austrian manager Herbert Prohaska said: &quot;Scotland are now in the best position but I think things are still in the balance as they've got to go to Sweden and Sweden have still to come to Vienna.&quot;</p>
