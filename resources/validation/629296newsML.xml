<p>The leaders of Turkey's crumbling Islamist-led government met their party elders ahead of talks on Sunday on ways to resolve the deepening crisis surrounding their coalition.</p>
<p>Advisers to Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and his secularist deputy, Tansu Ciller, said the two were to meet in the afternoon ahead of a news conference expected to set out the future of their 11-month-old alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not clear when the two are meeting, but a news conference is set for four o'clock (1300 GMT) at the prime minister's office,&quot; a spokesman for Erbakan told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Turkish press said the two leaders would discuss a government reshuffle and early elections.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a leading member of Erbakan's Islam-based Welfare Party told a news conference that early polls were needed.</p>
<p>&quot;Early elections have become a necessity...Delaying elections would be risky for our democracy,&quot; Welfare deputy leader Riza Ulucak told reporters at party headquarters.</p>
<p>A minister from Ciller's True Path Party (DYP) said on Saturday elections could be held as early as October to end the crisis in the coalition since the military demanded a crackdown on Islamist activism.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not know the certain date but elections could take place in mid-October,&quot; state-run Anatolian news agency quoted Health Minister Ismail Karakuyu as saying.</p>
<p>The DYP has been locked in bargaining with its Islamist coalition partners over a possible date for early elections to save the coalition.</p>
<p>Ciller promised her party she would press Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist leader, to let her lead the country to polls as caretaker head of government.</p>
<p>However, the two sides have been unable to agree on a date. Turkish press reports say Erbakan wants a quick poll, but Ciller was holding out for a date next spring. Elections would normally be due by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Under the existing coalition protocol, Ciller was to take over the prime minister's office in June of 1998.</p>
<p>Erbakan met for four hours on Saturday evening with leading members of his Welfare Party after a monthly meeting of the National Security Council (NSC), state-run Anatolian news agency reported.</p>
<p>At the NSC meeting, the secularist armed forces renewed pressure on Erbakan to curb a rise in Moslem activism since he became prime minister last June.</p>
<p>Erbakan has dragged his feet, setting him at odds with Ciller's conservative and secularist party members. That has caused a steady flow of defections of True Path MPs and ministers decrying Erbakan's failure to implement the army directives.</p>
<p>On Friday the resignation of a senior True Path deputy and former minister cost the government its absolute majority in parliament, leaving it one seat short of the 276 votes needed.</p>
