<headline>CFM drops on warning pricing will hurt margins.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of CFM Technologies Inc dropped about 24 percent after the West Chester, Pa.-based company said agressive pricing will hurt gross margins for the rest of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>CFM Technologies lost 8-5/8 to 28-3/4.  More than one million shares changed hands before midday, which is about 10 times the normal trading volume.</p>
<p>CFM Technologies makes wet processing equipment for makers of semiconductors and flat panel displays.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, CFM said second quarter net sales nearly doubled to $20.1 million from $10.1 million in the second quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Second quarter net income was $1.9 million or $0.25 per share, on 7.9 million weighted average common shares outstanding, compared with net income of $625,000 or $0.16 per share on 3.9 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Gross margin for the second quarter ended April 30 was 46.5 percent, lower than 49.6 percent a year ago but slightly above 46.1 percent in the first quarter of 1997.  </p>
<p>CFM said its gross margins will continue to be affected by various factors, including the mix and average selling prices of systems, sales of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) automation equipment, which yield relatively lower gross margins, and the costs associated with new system introductions.</p>
<p>CFM said no orders for flat panel displays (FPD) were received during the second quarter and total orders for the quarter trailed the first quarter's orders.</p>
<p>Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $25.3 million, with FPD systems represented 64 percent of the backlog.</p>
<p>&quot;While total quarterly orders represent a decline from those reported in the first quarter, we anticipate continued growth in demand for our products,&quot; CFM said in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>The company also said it expects increases in spending in support of research, development and engineering.</p>
