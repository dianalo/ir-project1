<p>Swedish fashion retailer H&amp;M Hennes &amp; Mauritz put on a show on Monday by presenting a higher than expected pre-tax profit for the first six months of its fiscal year 1996/1997 which sent its share to a record high.</p>
<p>The group said pre-tax profit surged 63 percent to 1.01 billion crowns ($130.1 million) in the first half of its fiscal year while analysts in a Reuter poll targeted 832 million on average.</p>
<p>Shares rocketed 26 crowns to an all-time intra-day high of 293 on the Stockholm Stock Exchange just after the report but slipped back somewhat to trade at 282.5 crowns at 0915 GMT, up 15.5 or six percent.</p>
<p>Profit was boosted by a sales increase of 31 percent to 10.18 billion crowns despite a fairly weak market.</p>
<p>&quot;The general retail sales development in Europe has remained weak, even if some of H&amp;M's markets showed a positive development,&quot; the group said.</p>
<p>&quot;The exceptionally favourable sales development...mean that the H&amp;M group have taken relatively large market shares on all markets in the first half year.&quot; ($ = 7.763 Swedish Crowns)  </p>
<p>The amount of sales outside Sweden edged higher to 78 percent from 74 percent.</p>
<p>Sales rose both in comparable stores -- stores that H&amp;M operated during the first half of 1996/1997 and in the same year-earlier period -- and in new stores, the company said.</p>
<p>H&amp;M opened 21 new stores in the six-month period, compared to 27 in the corresponding previous half year.</p>
<p>&quot;During the remaining part of the fiscal year, H&amp;M plans to open about 35 new stores (up from 32),&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Investments fell to 327 million crowns from 345 million, including a fall in set-up costs to 47 million crowns, from 70 million, the company said.</p>
<p>Operating profit after depreciation rose to 1.01 billion crowns from 646 million, while earnings per share jumped to 3.16 crowns from 1.94.</p>
