<p>The British economy continued to make solid progress in the third quarter with healthy increases in company orders, profits and performance for the second consecutive quarter, a leading business group said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Institute of Directors (IoD) said its September survey of business opinion suggested the Treasury's revised forecast of 2.5 percent growth for 1996 may not be totally out of reach.</p>
<p>&quot;The increases in company performance and employment, combined with benign price and costs pressures, show the economy is continuing to make solid progress,&quot; said Ruth Lea, head of the IoD's policy unit.  </p>
<p>&quot;Moreover, directors are optimistic about their prospects for the forthcoming quarter suggesting that the Chancellor's GDP growth forecast of 2.5 percent for 1996 may well be within grasp.&quot;</p>
<p>The revival in the manufacturing sector, which became evident in the June survey results, appeared to have flattened out over the past three months. A significant lower rate of increase was reported this quarter.</p>
<p>The outlook for the next three months continues to be positive with the majority of directors optimistic about their prospects for the forthcoming quarter.  </p>
<p>The level of optimism had, however, fallen since the last quarter and there was an element of uncertainty over whether the upturn that had taken place in sectors such as construction would be consolidated.</p>
<p>Although there was some evidence that pay awards were still running ahead of the rate of inflation, price and cost pressures appeared, on the whole, to have been kept in check over the past three months, the survey said.</p>
<p>As such, it looks likely that the government will also succeed in bringing inflation within its target limits during the next year although the longer term prospects for inflation are somewhat more uncertain.</p>
<p>The best performing sectors were construction and non-business services. Companies in the construction industry reported especially strong growth in key areas such as orders, output and profits, suggesting an end to the long period of stagnation which had blighted this key sector.</p>
