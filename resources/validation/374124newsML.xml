<p>Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori believes some Japanese companies or families may have paid ransoms to leftist rebels holding hostages in Lima, a major Japanese newspaper reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Mainichi Shimbun said Fujimori raised the possibility in a meeting with Japanese reporters during a visit to London earlier this week.</p>
<p>&quot;President Fujimori told a news conference with Japanese news organisations held in a hotel in London it is possible a ransom has been paid by Japanese companies whose employees are being held in the (Japanese ambassador's) residence or the families of the hostages,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some suspicion that Japanese companies or the families of the hostages have paid some sum as a ransom,&quot; the Mainichi quoted Fujimori as saying.</p>
<p>About 15 members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) took over the residence on December 17 demanding that Peru free imprisoned comrades in exchange for the lives of about 500 hostages.</p>
<p>Since the takeover, the rebels have released most hostages but still hold 72 captives, including elite members of Peru's armed forces, judiciary and government, Japanese diplomats and top executives of Japanese companies.</p>
<p>The Mainichi said that when asked by reporters if ransoms had been paid only for released hostages, Fujimori replied:</p>
<p>&quot;I can't say for sure if it's only those who have been released.&quot;</p>
<p>Commenting on the report, Japan's top spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama said the government had no knowledge of ransoms being paid.</p>
<p>&quot;From our contacts with firms and families with hostages in the residence, we understand that no ransom has been paid,&quot; Kajiyama told reporters.</p>
