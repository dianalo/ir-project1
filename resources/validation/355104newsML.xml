<p>Turkey's biggest leftist party said on Tuesday it would file a censure motion against the Islamist-conservative government to preserve the secular democracy of the country.</p>
<p>&quot;We decided it was necessary to start the legal process to free the country from this government,&quot; Bulent Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left Party, told his MPs. He said the motion would focus on problems of the &quot;secular, democratic republic, foreign affairs, economic and social issues and security.&quot;</p>
<p>Ecevit said the Islamist Welfare Party was the target of the censure and that many members of the junior conservative alliance partner would support the motion.</p>
<p>He did not say when his party would present the motion.</p>
<p>Necmettin Erbakan, Turkey's first Islamist prime minister, apparently renounced his radical pro-Islam and anti-Western election pledges when he came to power at the head of a coalition in June.</p>
<p>But he has angered the secularist wing of his coalition government and the powerful, secularist army in recent weeks with plans to build mosques and other Islamist programmes.</p>
<p>A new furore broke out at the weekend over an anti-Israel rally in Ankara's Welfare-held Sincan district, which was roundly condemned by secularist parties.</p>
<p>Twenty tanks and 15 armoured personnel carriers on Tuesday paraded through Sincan in an apparent show of strength by the army.</p>
<p>Military officials said the march was part of routine training exercises and denied any link to Friday's rally in Sincan.</p>
<p>The interior ministry has launched an investigation into Sincan Mayor Bekir Yildiz over the &quot;Jerusalem Night&quot; protest. His comments at the rally have been criticised in the media as a call for the implementation of the strict Islamic sharia law.</p>
