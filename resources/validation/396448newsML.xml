<p>Top seed Michael Chang bounced back after dropping the first set and celebrated his 25th birthday by defeating Todd Martin on Saturday to reach the finals of the $825,000 St. Jude tennis tournament.</p>
<p>Chang, who played his first professional match at the tournament a decade ago, reached the Memphis final for the first time after five semifinal appearances by rallying past third-seeded Martin 3-6 6-4 6-4.</p>
<p>Chang's opponent in Sunday's final will be eighth seed Todd Woodbridge of Australia.</p>
<p>The red-hot Woodbridge, who won the Australian hardcourt tournament in Adelaide last month, beat 13th seed Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden 6-1 7-5 in his semifinal.</p>
<p>Woodbridge, 12-1 in singles this year, has beaten Chang only twice in 12 career meetings.</p>
<p>First prize is $120,000.  </p>
<p>Martin, a two-time Memphis champion, was attempting to reach his fifth straight final here and appeared on track from the outset. He broke Chang in the third game of the opening set by whipping a forehand return down the line. He broke Chang again to close the set.</p>
<p>But Chang was up to the challenge. He broke Martin to open the second set and it was all that he needed. He got another break early in the third set to go up 2-1 and relied on his trademark speed and quickness to finish the victory.</p>
<p>Martin, 1-5 lifetime against Chang, was impressed with the comeback and the speed.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not how fast he is when you've got him running from side to side, it's his knack of positioning himself so he can take advantage of his speed,&quot; said Martin.</p>
<p>Chang, who has spent the week answering questions about his inability to reach the Memphis final, said he was glad to finally reach the Sunday match.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels great,&quot; he said. &quot;Obviously the goal isn't to get to the final, but to win here. This is a special place for me, this is where I made my professional debut (in 1988).&quot;</p>
<p>Woodbridge, best known for his outstanding doubles play, dominated early and then proved he was up to the challenge in the second set. Bjorkman broke to tie the set at 5-all, but Woodbridge broke back and served out the set.</p>
<p>Bjorkman, broken once in three matches leading to the semifinals, was broken twice in the first set.</p>
<p>Woodbridge, ranked 32nd, broke the Swede in the second game of the match with a crosscourt forehand that ended a lengthy rally. He broke Bjorkman again in the sixth game to go up 5-1, winning with another cross court forehand off a drop shot. The first set lasted just 25 minutes.</p>
<p>It's tough to play that standard for a whole match,'' he said. You know you are going to have a lapse.&quot;</p>
<p>In the second set, Woodbridge was the victim of an overrule by chair umpire Norm Chryst that brought a break point against Woodbridge. He followed with his first double fault of the match, slamming his racket down in disgust still upset by the overrule.</p>
