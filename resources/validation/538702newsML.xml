<title>RUSSIA: Russian draft tax code not seen widening deficit.</title>

<p>The Russian government will lose 72.6 trillion roubles after the new tax code comes into force in 1998, but the deficit will not grow as the government will cut social spending, a top government official said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The government plans to control the budget deficit very strictly,&quot; Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Shatalov told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We intend to carry out a social reform, which will provide for a cut in all sorts of privileges and cuts in government costs. It is a tough decision, of course, but it can stimulate economic development.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the government expected tax volumes to start growing in two to three years after the code comes into force, tentatively in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;But the first year will be very difficult,&quot; Shatalov said.</p>
<p>The government will pass the draft tax code to the State Duma lower house of parliament by April 30, he said.</p>
<p>International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus has said that submitting the code to the Duma is a condition for the IMF releasing money to Russia from its $10 billion three-year loan.</p>
<p>&quot;The government hopes the code will be passed this year, so that it starts working in 1998,&quot; Shatalov said. &quot;We are asking the Duma to discuss it as a top priority issue.&quot;</p>
<p>The government today discussed the second, third and fourth parts of the draft tax code and the new version increased the budget's losses to 72.6 trillion roubles from 40 trillion roubles, he said.</p>
<p>Under the new code taxes will account for 32.5 percent of gross domestic product against 35.2 percent currently, he said.</p>
<p>The new tax code provides for serious tax relief for companies, Shatalov said.</p>
<p>Profit, income and wage fund taxes, which now exist in two forms -- the federal and the local -- will be replaced by one tax, he said.</p>
<p>The replacement of the two wage fund taxes with one tax will mean a seven percent cut in taxation for companies, he said.</p>
<p>He said the wage fund tax would not exceed 35.5 percent. Individuals will have to pay 12 percent income tax for an annual income of up to 60 million and 30 percent for more than 60 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Those companies which do not have any privileges will feel the change in full,&quot; Shatalov said.</p>
<p>The government plans to raise Value Added Tax to 22 percent from 20 percent and cancel a low 10 percent VAT band, he said.</p>
<p>The new draft code provides for a 30 percent excise duty for cars with an engine of over 2.5 litres, he said.</p>
