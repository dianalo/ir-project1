<p>The BBC's share of Britain's television viewing audience in the 12 months ended June 30 edged down for second consecutive quarter, Britain's television watchdog said on Monday.</p>
<p>The BBC1 and BBC2 channels together claimed 43.4 percent of the viewing audience, down from 43.9 percent in the 12 months ended March 31, the Independent Television Commission (ITC) said in its quarterly report on audience share.</p>
<p>The flagship BBC1 station held 31.9 percent of the viewing audience, down from 32.2 percent in the 12 months ended March. BBC2 won 11.5 percent of the audience, off from 11.7 percent in the prior period, the ITC said.</p>
<p>The ITV, the mass market, commercial network which includes multiple regional licensees as well as GMTV, slipped to a 34.2 percent share in the 12 months ended in June from 34.6 percent in the period ended March 31, the ITC said.</p>
<p>Both the BBC and ITV fell at the expense of Channel 5, Britain's fifth terrestrial television channel and its third commercial network which debuted Easter weekend. Channel 5 claimed 0.7 percent of the viewing audience in the 12 months ended June, based on the channel's viewing for the April to June quarter and expressed as a percentage of all television viewing in the complete 12-month period, the ITC said.</p>
<p>Channel 4's audience share was unchanged at 10.3 percent, the ITC said.</p>
