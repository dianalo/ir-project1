<p>An Israeli soldier escaped death in the mid-air crash of two army helicopters because a stubborn commander enforcing passenger limits forced him off just before takeoff, his family said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to tell the story of what was in fact a miracle,&quot; said the soldier's uncle Nissim Danna in a call to Israeli army radio two days after all 73 Lebanon-bound soldiers aboard were killed in Israel's worst military air disaster.</p>
<p>The nephew Raz Albahari, 20, boarded one of the two Sikorsky CH-53 transporters but was forced off along with a friend because of army regulations limiting the number who could fly. The two were told they would go next week.</p>
<p>&quot;At the last second they took him off,&quot; Danna said, describing a tug-of-war between two officers over what to do with Albahari. Both officers died in the crash.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the commanders said he had to have him at the post because he is a professional guy, an ordnance expert, and the second commander, the senior commander, simply disagreed. Under no circumstance was he prepared to let him board,&quot; Danna said.</p>
<p>Albahari, who has served 11 months in Lebanon and was due to spend up to two weeks on duty in Israel's self-declared Lebanon security zone, left on the helicopter a bag of sweets and milk and other items for a friend at the front.</p>
<p>He called his mother to say he was coming home.</p>
<p>It was close to 7 p.m., about the time of the crash. The mother Malka Albahari, 42, told Reuters her son caught a bus and arrived at his home in northern Israel at 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p>News of the crash was first broadcast on Israeli television at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>&quot;Then he put it together these were his friends. All of them were killed,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Albahari, who received psychological and medical treatment at a hospital, raced from funeral to funeral on Wednesday and Thursday, his mother said. The army spokesman barred him from speaking to reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I got my son as a gift,&quot; she said. &quot;It's the hand of God.&quot;</p>
