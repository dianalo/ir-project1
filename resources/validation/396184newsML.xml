<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her South Korean counterpart confirmed on Saturday that preliminary peace talks with North Korea would take place next month in New York.</p>
<p>Albright and South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong told a news conference in Seoul that their governments had agreed to meet North Korean representatives on March 5 to discuss a proposal for four-party talks including China to work for a lasting peace on the divided peninsula.</p>
<p>They spoke after several hours of talks held against the backdrop of dramatic changes in the reclusive North Korean leadership.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day Pyongyang announced the death of its powerful defence minister, Choe Kwang.</p>
<p>He was the third top official to disappear from the Stalinist state's ruling hierarchy in 10 days following the defection of a leading ideologue to the South on February 12 and Friday's news that premier Kang Song-san was being replaced.</p>
<p>South Korean officials believe the changes will lead to a major shake-up in Pyongyang's ruling elite at a time of heightened tensions on the peninsula.</p>
<p>At Saturday's news conference Yoo described the North Korean situation as &quot;volatile&quot;, adding: &quot;We have to avoid any active and armed clashes&quot; between the two sides.</p>
<p>Albright, who had earlier flown to Seoul after a whirlwind tour of major European capitals, told the conference: &quot;I am pleased to announce that we have agreed with North Korea on a joint Republic of Korea-U.S. briefing about our presidents' proposal to conduct four-party peace talks which will take place on March 5 in New York.&quot;</p>
<p>North Korea had announced the &quot;briefing&quot; plans on Friday but U.S. officials refused to confirm the meeting until after Albright's talks in Seoul with President Kim Young-sam and Yoo.</p>
<p>U.S. and South Korean officials were burned twice before when Pyongyang scheduled and then cancelled the briefing, deemed a necessary preliminary step to substantive peace talks.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. official acknowledged there was no certainty the North Koreans would attend this time until they actually showed up in New York.</p>
<p>But he said that previously, Pyongyang had played &quot;hard to get&quot; on the briefing issue and this time &quot;they acknowledge they want to come to this meeting&quot;.</p>
<p>Albright and Yoo also reaffirmed support for the 1994 agreement under which Washington and Seoul would provide $5 billion in light-water nuclear reactors to North Korea in return for Pyongyang freezing its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>Yoo said North Korea's desire to improve its devastated Stalinist economy was the &quot;most obvious answer&quot; to why Pyongang had now agreed to attend the New York briefing.</p>
<p>The New York Times in an editorial on Saturday accused South Korea of deliberately fanning tensions with North Korea. The senior official said he did not agree.</p>
<p>When North Korea announced on Friday that it would attend the briefing, some analysts saw it as a sign the communist North was trying to put on a normal face after the embarrassing defection of top ideologue Hwang Jang-yop, currently hol;ed up in Seoul's Beijing mission.</p>
<p>North Korea had twice in the past month put off attending a peace talks &quot;briefing&quot; in what was seen as an effort to press Washington to provide more food aid for its hungry population.</p>
<p>Washington insists it never promised Pyongyang a specific amount of food aid in return for the Stalinist regime's participation in the briefing.</p>
<p>Pyongyang reneged on its promise to attend earlier briefings when it was unable to close on a deal with U.S.-based Cargill Inc. on 500,000 tonnes of grain. That deal still has not been completed.</p>
<p>This week, however, the United States and South Korea acted to alleviate the North's food needs by pledging $10 million and $6 million in new assistance, respectively, through the World Food Programme, a United Nations agency.</p>
<p>Washington and Seoul proposed the four-way talks last April to defuse tensions -- and eventually bring about a permanent peace -- on the peninsula.</p>
<p>The two Koreas remain technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace pact.</p>
<p>Asked if North Korea was manipulating the United States and South Korea with its erratic behaviour, Albright said: &quot;I believe no country plans a famine and to be the beggar on the international stage.&quot;</p>
<p>Yoo said South Korea's food shortage is &quot;one of the important issues that we are dealing with&quot;. Once Pyongyang came to the peace talks, he added, serious discussions about larger food assistance could take place.</p>
<p>After her talks with Yoo and President Kim Young-sam, Albright was due to visit the demilitarised zone between North and South, where 37,000 U.S. troops help keep the uneasy peace.</p>
