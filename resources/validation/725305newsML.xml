<headline>IBCA cuts Dalgety l-term, s-term ratings.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-14</dateline>

<p>IBCA, the European rating agency, said on Monday it had cut the long-term rating of Dalgety Plc to BBB plus from A minus, and the short-term rating to A2 from A1.  </p>
<p>&quot;The problems it (Dalgety) experienced in financial year (FY) 1996 look set to continue for FY97 with the integration of the QEPF pet foods operation proving to be much more expensive and time consuming than originally anticipated,&quot; IBCA said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said the May 1997 announcement of 36 million sterling exceptional charges that were likely to adversely affect FY97 profit, was followed in July by a trading statement suggesting they may rise to 138 million sterling.</p>
<p>It said the cash element, originally 26 million sterling had risen to 37 million. &quot;Petfoods alone will account for 67 million sterling exceptional charges with the rationalisation process difficulties compounded by reduced production due to technical problems in two UK plants,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>It said BSE continued to affect Dalgety with stock write-downs totalling 11 million sterling required in the petfood and agribusiness division.</p>
<p>&quot;The combined effects of these problems have led to worsening operating performance, a likely FY97 retained loss of around 70 million sterling and a net cash outflow,&quot; IBCA said.</p>
<p>It said net debt should fall slightly to around 250 million sterling because of favourable currency translation effects, but added coverage ratios and gearing would deteriorate with no definite signs of improvement and much dependent on the new rationalisation and cost saving measures being put in place. -- International bonds unit +44 171 542 8682</p>
