<title>USA: Elections, economic data captivate U.S. markets.</title>
<headline>Elections, economic data captivate U.S. markets.</headline>

<p>For the next six weeks U.S. financial markets will fret over a possible leftward tilt in the next Congress and a slew of economic data that could clear up a muddy view on official interest rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>Congressional and presidential elections on November 5 will determine the fate of federal budget-balancing efforts and remove a big stumbling block for a Federal Reserve edging ever closer to raising short-term rates.</p>
<p>When Fed policy-makers next meet on November 13, they are unlikely to show as much patience as they did when they held rates steady at a meeting last Tuesday, the analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Prior to the election, one needed very compelling numbers to give the Fed enough reason to raise rates. After the election, the numbers needn't be quite as compelling,&quot; said Robert Hormats, vice chairman at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Economists disagree over how hesitant Fed officials were to raise rates so close to the elections, but none disputed that a return of Democratic control of the House of Representatives would dishearten investors hoping for an end federal deficits.</p>
<p>&quot;The Democratic leadership is pretty liberal and balancing the budget is not one of their priorities. A Democratic House would probably rattle the markets quite a bit -- and the Fed,&quot; said Sung Wohn Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp.</p>
<p>Ahead of the election, and the November 13 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, investors will glean what they can from crucial reports on September and October employment, third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth, plus retail sales and inflation data for September.</p>
<p>The FOMC will have to make its decision without October retail sales and consumer price index data due November 14.</p>
<p>Stocks and bonds will likely sell off in anticipation of tighter monetary policy if the data fail to show a significant slowdown from the 4.7-percent growth in the second quarter, analysts said.</p>
<p>Third-quarter GDP growth above 3.0 percent, with continued job growth near 250,000 a month and rising wage pressures, would virtually guarantee a Fed rate hike, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Strong job gains and retail sales would tip the Fed toward moving. But numbers that show a healthy deceleration would be very bullish for the markets,&quot; said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker.</p>
<p>Stocks could weather a Fed rate hike better than bonds, with signs of stronger economic growth offsetting fears of inflation and higher borrowing costs, analysts noted.</p>
<p>&quot;My guess is after an initial correction because of higher rates, the equity market would be buoyed becaused of reduced concern about earnings,&quot; Hormats said.</p>
<p>Markets have led a charmed life in 1996. Even after months of talk of imminent Fed tightening, the Dow Jones industrial average is near its record high.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield has hovered near 7.0 percent for nearly six months, staying between 6.75 and 7.25 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts believe that solid performance could continue if the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, a quarter point to 5.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Fed moves in a reasonable fashion, to some extent that will remove some of the current (monetary policy) uncertainty. The market might go down, but it would recover quickly,&quot; said Cripps.</p>
<p>In the currency market, the dollar remains somewhat immune to Fed deliberations since the U.S. trade deficit has deteriorated, analysts said.</p>
