<p>The EU commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Yves-Thibault de Silguy, said on Thursday the French budget probably conformed with Maastricht treaty provisions governing deficits but would be examined on its technical merits by the Commission.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably the French Plan is in conformity with the rules,&quot; de Silguy told Reuters before he addressed an Irish parliamentary select committee on Finance and General Affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;There are very strict legal rules and standards in the European system of economic accounts and we will apply on a technical basis the rule of these economic accounts.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier the chairman of the German parliament's European Affairs committee Norbert Wieczorek voiced doubts about the French government's use of a one-off payment of 37.5 billion French francs from France Telecom to cut the central state deficit. He said the measure was against the spirit of the European Union's Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a question of spirit or not spirit,&quot; de Silguy said. &quot;We will examine the details of the plan and we compare it with the rules and will apply it.&quot;</p>
<p>Some European analysts had expressed concern that the French budget might manipulate government finances to smooth France's entry into European Monetary Union (EMU).</p>
<p>The Maastricht Treaty requires that countries proceeding to the European single currency have a general government deficit not exceeding three percent of GDP.</p>
<p>French Prime Minister Alain Juppe unveiled a draft 1997 budget on Wednesday which indictated next year's overall public deficit would be at three percent of national output, the ceiling figure to gain entry to EMU.</p>
<p>De Silguy said the Commission had not yet seen the detail of the French Plan but there was no room for political debate on whether the French budget was mere &quot;window dressing&quot;.</p>
<p>Wieczorek said the decision to rely on the France Telecom payment diminished the French budget deficit by 0.4-0.5 of a percent, adding that this was a cause of concern to Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no room for a political appreciation. It is purely a technical examination,&quot; de Silguy said.</p>
