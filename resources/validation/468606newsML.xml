<p>South African wholesale liquor producers said on Wednesday they had resolved their dispute with the KWV co-operative over its plans to convert to a private company.</p>
<p>&quot;All the concerns we had identified were placed on the table, negotiated and satisfactorily concluded with the KWV,&quot; Andre Steyn, corporate and industrial affairs director at the Stellenbosch Farmers Winery Ltd (SFW), told Reuters.</p>
<p>SFW is a member of the Cape Wine and Spirits Institute (CWSI) which originally shared some of the concerns of Agriculture Minister Derek Hanekom about the KWV plan.</p>
<p>Hanekom has brought a court action to block KWV's conversion to a company. The Cape Town Supreme Court on Wednesday postponed the case to April 2.</p>
<p>Hanekom's legal advisor Steven Goldblatt said the KWV-CWSI agreement should be probed by the competition board.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems prima facie to fly in the face of a transparent, open and accessible market,&quot; Goldblatt said, adding that the accord appeared to mitigate against the entry of new players into the wine industry.</p>
<p>But Steyn said the CWSI intended to refer the agreement to the board anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be inviting their comments. There's no hidden agenda or anything underhand about this whole thing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;(The KWV plan) held certain implications for us. We needed to have those implications clarified. A lot of emotion has surrounded the whole issue,&quot; Steyn said.</p>
<p>He said one of the issues was the fear that the KWV, statutory regulator of the wine industry under the Wine and Spirits Control Act, would provide unfair competition in the local market as a private company.</p>
<p>&quot;The basis of the fear was that KWV as a statutory body had acquired an asset base that it could then, as a company unfettered by any regulatory framework, utilise in an unfair way if it was allowed to compete with us directly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our suppliers would be their members, and then shareholders, in direct competition with us, and that's a very unhealthy situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Steyn said other issues included the KWV's supply of planting material, competition for grapes and wine, provision of information, and &quot;a whole variety of different aspects&quot;.</p>
<p>Other CSWI members include Distillers Corp Ltd , Douglas Green Bellingham, Gilbeys and Seagram.</p>
<p>Sources close to the agreement who did not want to be identified said KWV had given the CWSI assurances that its marketing efforts would remain focused on exports, at least in the short term.</p>
<p>&quot;All the infrastructure needed for KWV suddenly to have products in the domestic market -- lorries, distribution channels, marketing channels -- all these things cost an incredible amount of money if you start from scratch,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>The sources said KWV believed its current activities were generating sufficient profits and that trying to break into the domestic market would not be attractive to the co-operative.</p>
<p>They said that because of a shortage of quality wine in South Africa, KWV did not have enough product to service its foreign customers.</p>
<p>KWV, with 4,400 winefarmer members, operates in about 50 countries but is barred by law from selling in Africa south of the equator unless its members agree.</p>
<p>It provides about 50 percent of the brandy sold in South Africa under various labels. According to court papers, KWV has accumulated assets of more than one billion rand ($230 million).</p>
