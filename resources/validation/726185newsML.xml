<p>Mild-mannered U.S. inflation continues to astound economists, and could muzzle the Federal Reserve's inflation bloodhounds for several months to come, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>Few experts could have predicted it, but price growth has declined steadily since 1991 and could go even lower, even as the economy has continuously expanded.</p>
<p>&quot;It definitely looks as if inflation in general is much better behaved than anybody has a right to expect,&quot; said Steve Wood, economist at BankAmerica Securities.  </p>
<p>Having watched producer prices fall for a sixth straight month in June, economists predicted only modest gains in the June Consumer Price Index, due Wednesday at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT.</p>
<p>The consensus forecast of a Reuters poll showed CPI up 0.2 percent overall and 0.2 percent excluding volatile food and energy components, the so-called core rate.</p>
<p>That follows a CPI gain of 0.1 percent in May, 0.2 percent on the core rate, and should keep trailing 12 months CPI near 2.2 percent, below the 2.4 percent CPI growth in 1996, analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Everywhere you look the inflation news continues to be favorable, not just in the inflation gauges themselves. Even looking down the road I'm having trouble coming up with danger signals,&quot; said Steve Slifer, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>Analysts cite falling energy prices, down 2.4 percent in May, crumbling gold prices, strong and possibly undermeasured productivity gains, a weak global economy and a generally strong dollar as keys to reining in price growth.  </p>
<p>Those factors more than offset strong U.S. economic growth, low unemployment and high resource utilization -- factors that have sparked past wage and price spirals, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy has a great deal of strength to it and ultimately, there will be some pricing response, but it will be much reduced in this cycle,&quot; said Wood.  </p>
<p>The whopping growth rate and low jobless rate in the first few months of 1997 induced Fed policymakers to raise the federal funds rate to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent on March 25. The economy grew an astounding 5.8 percent in the first quarter of 1997, pushing the jobless rate as low as 4.8-percent, a 23-year trough.</p>
<p>But the only notable sign of faster inflation has come from average hourly earnings, which had blipped toward a 4.0 percent annualized rate earlier this year before retreating to 3.5 percent in May and June.  </p>
<p>&quot;Whatever upward pressure there has been on wages, it's wearing off,&quot; said Slifer.</p>
<p>The economy is widely expected to have grown about 2.0 percent in the second quarter, below the 2.2 percent or so many analysts previously considered its potential, or maximum sustainable rate without faster inflation.</p>
<p>That would likely keep monetary policy on hold in coming months, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fed may just figure: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'&quot; said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Bank Corp.</p>
<p>In fact, the persistent decline in inflation probably helps raise the economy's potential growth rate toward 2.7 percent, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The longer inflation stays low, the better inflation expectations become. That changes people's behavior, which means you can probably grow the economy a little faster,&quot; Wood said.</p>
<p>Wood specifically cited wage demands, which tend to wane when inflation stays low.</p>
