<p>Sally Barsosio ran alone over the last three laps to clinch the first global title for a Kenyan woman in the world women's 10,000 metres final on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Barsosio, a bronze medallist at the 1993 championships in Stuttgart, broke away from Olympic and world champion Fernanda Ribeiro to win in 31 minutes 32.92 seconds.</p>
<p>Ribeiro hung on to take second in 31:39.15 with Japan's Masako Chiba third in 31:41.93.</p>
<p>Barsosio was fortunate to be reinstated after disqualification in Stuttgart because she caused problems in the race by running across several runners.</p>
<p>In the ninth lap on Tuesday, Ribeiro pointed at the Kenyan as if she were complaining about her position just outside her at the front of the pack.</p>
<p>After a slow start, Chiba and Chinese Yang Siju made the early pace before Ribeiro hit the front in the seventh lap with Barsosio right behind.</p>
<p>With eight laps remaining, Ethiopia's Olympic bronze medallist Gete Wami dropped out after hurting her foot.</p>
<p>Barsosio picked up the pace with three laps to go and burst away from the pack. She managed to quickly take a 10 metres lead over Ribeiro and was a good 50 metres ahead at the finish.</p>
