<p>Jerome Monod, chairman of French utilities firm Lyonnaise des Eaux, has resigned from the board of Havas, spokeswomen at the two companies said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They were commenting on reports in daily papers Les Echos and Le Figaro which said Monod was critical of some aspects of a recent accord between Havas and Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE).</p>
<p>The Lyonnaise spokeswoman declined to give a reason for Monod's move. The company currently owns &quot;less than one percent&quot; of Havas's capital, she said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month CGE became the biggest shareholder in Havas under an accord which also involved Havas becoming the largest shareholder in pay TV company Canal Plus.</p>
<p>Les Echos said Monod questioned the valuation of Generale des Images, a subsidiary of CGE, and of the 19.3 percent of Canal Plus in the deal.</p>
<p>He sought an independent valuation of Canal Plus, including its merger with the European interests of South Africa's Nethold,  but was turned down, the paper said.</p>
<p>Le Figaro said Lyonnaise des Eaux only learnt about the accord with CGE from press reports.</p>
<p>The Havas and Lyonnaise spokeswomen declined to comment.</p>
<p>Havas is to hold a shareholders' meeting on March 28 to approve the accord with CGE, the capital increase reserved for CGE and the appointment of new board members from CGE.</p>
<p>Five seats on the board will be held by CGE. These will be Guy Dejouany, CGE's honorary chairman who already had a seat, CGE chairman Jean-Marie Messier and three of his advisers, Guillaume Hannezo, Eric Licoys and Jean-Pascal Tranie, the Havas spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The Havas-CGE-Canal Plus accord has shaken up some of Havas's established alliances, because it has linked up with competitors of its existing partners, notably in television and telecommunications.</p>
<p>Among the television interests of Lyonnaise des Eaux are Lyonnaise Cable, a cable TV network which cables 2.2 million homes, 34 percent of M6, which is now France's second largest privately-owned terrestrial TV channel, and thematic channel Paris Premiere.</p>
<p>It also has a 10 percent direct holding in TPS (Television par satellite, one of two French digital satellite TV offerings).</p>
<p>In telecommunications, Lyonnaise has said it is interested in competing in operating local loop connections using its cable networks once European telecoms markets open to competition from next January.</p>
<p>CGE is active in the mobile telephony market and has said it aims to become the main competitor of France Telecom after telecommunications liberalisation.</p>
<p>Michel Bon, chairman of France Telecom, still has a seat on the Havas board. France Telecom has declined to comment on whether he will stay.</p>
