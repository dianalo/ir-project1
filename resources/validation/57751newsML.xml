<headline>Stocks, bonds fall; dollar up on rate hike fears.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Blue-chip stocks edged lower, bonds tumbled and the dollar rose Tuesday as renewed expectations of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve gripped Wall Street.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended off just 0.37 of a point at 5,888.83 after setting records on Monday and Friday.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,423 to 956 on active volume of 442 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;We're just giving a wee bit of ground after a sharp move on the upside,&quot; said Alan Ackerman, a market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co. &quot;All signs show the market is working higher but we have some weakness. There's the fear the Fed will move to raise interest rates.&quot;</p>
<p>The interest-rate sensitive blue-chip stocks took their lead from bonds after comments by a senior Federal Reserve official led the market to believe interest rates might be raised. At one time, the Dow index was down 40 points before it staged a late afternoon recovery.</p>
<p>The unidentified official told Reuters that eight out of 12 Fed banks had asked for an increase in the discount rate, the rate the Fed charges banks for direct loans.</p>
<p>The 30-year Treasury bond lost nearly a full point and its yield rose above the psychologically important 7 percent level to close at 7.03 percent vs. 6.95 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>Last week, the Dow Jones index rallied 178.66 points to its second-biggest weekly point gain ever as economic reports for August pointed to moderating growth and tame inflation.</p>
<p>The market extended its run on Monday, with the index climbing 51 points to close at an all-time high of 5,889.20.</p>
<p>Wall Street had been betting that the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee would keep short-term interest rates unchanged at its Sept. 24 meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;Stocks are doing great against bonds. If the Fed tightens, it will get very ugly in the stock market next week,&quot; said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers. He said the market had risen on expectations that the Fed would keep its interest rates steady.</p>
<p>&quot;We priced it out and would undo a lot of the advance of the past two weeks,&quot; Shulman said.</p>
<p>The technology-studded Nasdaq Composite index closed up 9.35 points to 1,203.31 after Intel Corp., the world's No. 1 computer chip maker, said its third-quarter revenues would be better than previously predicted.</p>
<p>It was the first close above 1,200 for the Nasdaq index since June 17 when it ended at 1,207.64.</p>
<p>The dollar rose in New York to a high of 1.5161 German marks and 110.44 Japanese yen.</p>
<p>In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 1.5143 marks, up from 1.5110 marks on Monday. The American currency stood at 110.35 yen vs. 110.20 yen on Monday.</p>
<p>Crude oil prices ended higher as tensions built again about a U.S. military buildup in the Mideast Gulf, the largest oil producing area.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange, October crude oil ended 12 cents a barrel higher at $23.31 after a senior Iraqi official said he expected a U.S. attack soon.</p>
<p>October heating oil closed up 0.30 cent to 65.59 cents a gallon but October gasoline ended down 0.13 cent to 62.74 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Board of Trade fresh concerns about cold weather in the Midwest possibly hurting this year's late-planted soybean crop supported prices. November soybeans closed 3 cents a bushel higher at $7.96.</p>
<p>Corn, which looks to be in better shape across the Midwest, closed mostly lower. September corn fell 5-3/4 cents a bushel at $3.51-1/4.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE index finished with a loss of 4.9 points at 3,972.3. The Tokyo stock market's benchmark Nikkei 225 average galloped higher in late afternoon trade to close 467.95 points higher at 21,310.59 after briefly recording 500 point gains in the afternoon session.</p>
