<p>Business travelers who find working on the road is expansive in an unwelcome way may have plenty of company.</p>
<p>A recent survey found that half of more than 500 business travelers polled said they ate more while on out-of-town assignments than at home, and one in four said they hit the bar In addition, 57 percent said they ate later when travelling.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted for Hilton Hotels Corp. as part of its research into finding ways to help guests get a better night's sleep.</p>
<p>Avoiding heavy meals, especially late in the evening, and staying away from alcoholic beverages at least three hours before bedtime are two of the keys to a proper night's sleep, according to the company and the National Sleep Foundation, which helped conduct the research.</p>
<p>The hotel chain has been investigating what makes people sleep better away from home and plans soon to offer experimental sleep-friendly rooms with various amenities in several cities.</p>
<p>Among the items in or around the rooms may be extra insulation for soundproofing, live plants, devices that produce neutral sound or &quot;white noise,&quot; a store of pillows in a variety of shapes and textures and a sleep mask and earplugs.</p>
<p>On another hotel room topic, a survey conducted by Fodor's Travel Publications Inc. found that about six out of 10 guests always check the bedsheets first when they get into a new room.</p>
<p>Thirty-seven percent order room service, about one in four can't resist unlocking the in-room bar, whether they buy anything from it or not; and 31 percent take the complimentary toiletries when they check out.</p>
<p>In another area of interest to frequent travelers, the trend toward charging guests a fee for early checkout, which began earlier this year, appears to be spreading in the lodging industry.</p>
<p>Frequent Flyer Magazine reports in its September issue that Inter-Continental is testing a $50 early departure fee for convention guests at its hotel in Chicago, and Renaissance is trying out a fee of the same size at hotels in Dallas and Washington.</p>
<p>Fifty-dollar fees are also being tested by Wyndham at the Anatole in Dallas and by Lowe's at Washington, Annapolis, Md., and Nashville, Tenn., the publication said.</p>
<p>Variations of the fee concept are already in place at many Westin, Hyatt and Hilton properties.</p>
