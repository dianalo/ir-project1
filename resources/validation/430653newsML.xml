<p>German construction investment should fall another 2.5 percent this year, forcing 10 percent of contractors into bankruptcy and adding to the country's jobs crisis, the ZDB builders' association said on Monday.</p>
<p>Investment in the building sector, which accounts for about 10 percent of the German economy, dropped 2.7 percent last year.</p>
<p>Losses plus lower sales and orders should remain the rule at least until the second half of this year, ZDB president Fritz Eichbauer told a news conference.</p>
<p>About 7,000 building workers protested on Monday against mass unemployment in the sector by stopping work on Berlin's Potsdamer Platz, where a towering forest of cranes overlook Europe's largest construction site.</p>
<p>The IG Bau union said construction workers would hold a vigil all week at the Brandenburg Gate.</p>
<p>Construction Minister Klaus Toepfer said last year's 6.8 percent decline in public construction investment had amplified the industry downturn and had to be stopped.</p>
<p>The government would be looking harder at possibilities for private financing of public works projects such as water treatment plants, which can cut costs sharply, Toepfer said.</p>
<p>Thousands of coal miners fearing for their jobs also grabbed headlines by blocking Bonn's main thoroughfare on Monday. But Eichbauer said the employment outlook in the construction sector was even bleaker. &quot;The construction industry will shed more jobs this year than there are coal miners in all of Germany,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Construction employment was likely to fall to 900,000 by the end of the decade from 1.3 million today, he said, a trend that ran counter to the government's goal of halving unemployment in the same period.</p>
<p>He estimated that 400,000 workers in the highly seasonal industry were out of work in January, when a 25 percent month-on-month decline in construction output was the main reason behind a 1.7 percent fall in industrial production.</p>
<p>Bad weather, changes to winter payments for idle workers and the lapsing of tax incentives for construction in east Germany were cited as the main reasons for the January slump.</p>
<p>About 150,000 of those construction workers might now be back at work but by the end of March unemployment in the sector would still be 200,000 to 250,000. The industry should show a net 90,000 decline in jobs this year, he said.</p>
<p>There are fewer than 100,000 hard-coal miners in Germany.</p>
<p>Eichbauer estimated that 7,000 of Germany's 70,000 building contractors could go bust this year as building prices fell another two percent. ZDB, which represents construction industry employers, projected building investment would fall by two percent in western Germany this year and four percent in the east.</p>
<p>Even the construction of new government buildings in Berlin could not outweigh a slackening of momentum from German unification and reconstruction of the former communist region.</p>
<p>Investment in housing would fall by 2.5 percent, in commercial construction by two percent and in the public sector by three percent, the ZDB said.</p>
<p>Eichbauer called on the government to boost public spending on construction. As bright spots of latent demand, he said 50 billion marks ($29.3 billion) in investment was needed for energy conservation measures in public buildings and 30 billion marks for remodelling railway stations.</p>
<p>But he acknowledged that government at all levels was under pressure to slash spending and reduce deficits. Germany aims to reduce its budget deficit this year to three percent of total economic output to qualify for European monetary union.</p>
<p>Eichbauer forecast that the industry could be back on the upswing next year or the year after but might never again see the surges of demand it experienced periodically in Germany's postwar and even post-unification history.</p>
<p>Still, a long-term forecast by the respected Ifo economic research institute, showing average 0.3 percent growth in the construction sector through to 2006, was too pessimistic, he said.</p>
<p>Eichbauer said the industry would be forced to reduce sick pay as the law now allowed and was not in a position to offer wage rises that kept pace even with Germany's current low level of inflation.</p>
