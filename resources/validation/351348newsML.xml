<p>MGE spring wheat futures ended lower after warmer weather graced the northern Plains over the weekend, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said the warmer temperatures had allowed grain movement to normalize as elevator operators caught up on loading railcars.</p>
<p>&quot;It's important to note that we've gained relative to Chicago as we've had this bitter cold weather,&quot; a MGE trader said. &quot;I think you saw that premium being erased today after we got nice weather this weekend. But that could change tomorrow -- there's a new big storm headed our way.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said some areas of the Dakotas and Minnesota could receive up to a foot of snow by Tuesday.</p>
<p>MGE spring wheat closed 1/2 to 2-1/2 cents per bushel lower, with March down 1-1/2 cent at $3.76-1/2. MGE spring wheat bucked the trend seen in other U.S. wheat markets when it failed to follow CBOT soybeans higher at the close.</p>
<p>Traders said a number of commercial firms were scale-down buyers of the March contract.</p>
<p>MGE barley futures closed three to five cents per hundredweight lower, with March down five cents at $6.55.</p>
