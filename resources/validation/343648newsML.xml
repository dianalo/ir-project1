<p>The Tajik government has released seven members of the armed Islamist opposition captured in the former Soviet republic's civil war, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a gesture of goodwill,&quot; said Zafar Ikromov, a Tajik government representative on a United Nations-sponsored commission on prisoners. The men were released on Wednesday evening in a region east of the capital Dushanbe.</p>
<p>&quot;The seven former anti-government fighters have already been brought to the Garm region and handed over to local opposition field commanders,&quot; Ikromov told Reuters.</p>
<p>Last month, Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov and opposition leader Sayid Abdullo Nuri agreed a ceasefire at talks aimed at ending the conflict which has killed tens of thousands of people in the last four years.</p>
<p>The ceasefire appears to be holding and the government has released 13 prisoners since December.</p>
<p>But the opposition says it has released 111 government servicemen in similar gestures over the same period, and that more than 600 of its fighters are languishing in government prisons.</p>
<p>For its part, the government says 300 of its servicemen are still held hostage in the country's central Tavildara region alone.</p>
