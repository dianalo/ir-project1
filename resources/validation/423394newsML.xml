<p>Albania's military forces, pitched against armed insurgents, are desperately short of modern equipment, according to Western experts.</p>
<p>Army conscripts have been clothed in cast-off uniforms from the old East German People's Army, according to the authoritative Jane's Sentinel in its latest annual security assessment of the Balkans.</p>
<p>Training areas are believed to be located close to barracks in order to save fuel, the publication said.</p>
<p>In a country that once relied on 700,000 small concrete pillboxes built by its Stalinist leadership during the Cold War to ward off invasion, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps have provided training assistance since Albania joined Nato's Partnership for Peace programme. But modern weapon systems are still lacking.</p>
<p>The 45,000-strong army is equipped with an estimated 720 Chinese Type-59 main battle tanks while 138 T-34 tanks are in storage, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.</p>
<p>Albania's 10,000-strong air force has nearly 100 combat planes including a handful of relatively recent MiG-21s but also some MiG-15s, a type of warplane that first saw service in the now defunct Soviet Union nearly 50 years ago.</p>
<p>Jane's said Albanian troops had not been supplied with any major weapons systems for some time.</p>
<p>&quot;After 40 years of diplomatic isolation and the five years of economic hardship that followed, all equipment of the Albanian armed forces has become obsolete,&quot; Jane's said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an urgent need to re-equip and modernise the Albanian armed forces for the nation's self-defence. This is unlikely to be achieved in the short term because of a critical lack of funding.&quot;</p>
<p>Some reorganisation has already begun. Army Chief of Staff General Sheme Kosova was on Wednesday dismissed and replaced by Major General Adem Copani, President Sali Berisha's military adviser.</p>
<p>Kosova had failed to prevent military posts being stormed and looted of their weapons by &quot;terrorists&quot;, an official statement said.</p>
<p>While former army officers have been taking inventories of seized weapons and marshalling rebel fighters, two air force pilots defected to Italy in a MiG-15. &quot;All air force aircraft and equipment are obsolete in current Western terms and have lacked effective technical support since Albania's break in relations with China in 1978,&quot; Jane's said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the meantime, the air force has reportedly achieved a surprisingly high standard of serviceability using its elderly aircraft.</p>
<p>&quot;There is concern that flight safety has been reduced because of a lack of training flights,&quot; Jane's said.</p>
<p>Despite Berisha's courting of the West, Western powers have been reluctant to provide Albania with arms for fear of upsetting the strategic balance in the region following the outbreak of war in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
