<p>AMLC COMMENTARY: The rain in Queensland and northern New South Wales, coupled with continued hot and dry conditions across the lower half of Australia created a divergence between cattle markets in these areas.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the improvement in seasonal conditions across the north should increase restocker activity in southern saleyards.  Some areas in the north are emerging from a prolonged period of drought and producers will no doubt be keen to rebuild herds if financial positions permit.  </p>
<p>The U.S. beef market moved higher this week as traders who have sold product forward moved to cover their positions.</p>
<p>Prices for boxed beef increased 1-2 USc/lb, while those for U.S. manufacturing beef moved five USc/lb higher.  This in turn jolted futures prices, which moved between 1-3USc/lb higher with the February and April contracts showing the greatest gains. U.S. fed cattle prices gained one USc/lb to 65USc/lb.</p>
<p>In Japan, the beef market stabilised this week to some extent as currency markets settled down.  </p>
<p>Demand in Japan, however, remains fairly stagnant.  New business in response to imminent spring market sales is not yet apparent.</p>
<p>Demand for frozen beef did start to surface this week, according to trade sources, in response to decreasing inventories and also the imminent drop in the import duty.</p>
<p>In the interim, buyers not wanting to get caught with expensive meat and the higher tariff have only been buying to cover immediate needs.  With market demand already slow, little is expected to change before early March.</p>
