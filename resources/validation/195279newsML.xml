<p>A shooting and reports of bribery and intimidation marred Thailand's elections on Sunday after one of the dirtiest and most violent campaigns in memory.</p>
<p>A gunman shot and seriously injured a policeman and an election official in the western Bangkok suburb of Bang Khae, but was arrested shortly afterwards, police said.</p>
<p>Television stations reported that some voters in the northern province of Petchabun claimed they had received marked ballot papers at polling booths in the area.</p>
<p>Election supervisors were investigating the allegations.</p>
<p>Pollwatch, the election watchdog, said it had received 75 complaints of voters being offered cash to vote for certain candidates and heard of seven cases of physical intimidation.</p>
<p>Sunday's vote brings an end to what many are calling the dirtiest and most violent campaign in decades.</p>
<p>Billions of baht have been used by politicians in this election. At least eight political workers have been shot dead by gunmen and dozens of others have been attacked while campaigning, police said.</p>
<p>Voter turnout was strong as people walked, drove or rowed to vote under mixed skies in most of Thailand. Polling stations were opened at 8 a.m. (0100 GMT) and are due to close at 3 p.m.(0800 GMT).</p>
<p>More than 38 million Thais are eligible to vote in the election, seen as a close race between the Democrat Party led by former premier Chuan Leekpai and the New Aspiration Party (NAP) of Defence Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.</p>
<p>Opinion polls are divided over the outcome and the Democrats and the NAP, which are expected to win about 125 seats each, project a wafer-thin victory margin.</p>
<p>Premier Banharn Silpa-archa was also running in the election. Although he was expected to easily win a seat in parliament, his Chart Thai Party -- which won the most seats in the last July 2, 1995, election -- was not expected to garner enough votes to be a major force in the next government.</p>
<p>Unofficial results are expected to trickle in from about 1100 GMT. Official numbers should be available by about 1700 GMT.</p>
<p>Residents in Pathum Thani, 46 km (28 miles) northwest of Bangkok, rowed through flooded streets to get to the polling booths. Others in the northeast rode elephants to get through rough terrain to cast their ballots.</p>
<p>Former army chief Chavalit, whose party was a partner in the last two coalition governments, was surrounded by crowds as he went to cast his ballot at a Buddhist temple in Nakhon Panom in northeastern Thailand.</p>
<p>Chuan, Thailand's longest-serving, democratically elected prime minister before he was forced to dissolve parliament after a land scandal in May 1995, walked hand-in-hand with his mother after voting in southern Trang province.</p>
<p>A total of 2,310 candidates from 13 parties are vying for 393 seats in this election, the country's second in 16 months after Banharn dissolved parliament in September.</p>
<p>The party winning the most seats in the election has the right to form a new government. But no one party has ever won enough seats to hold a parliamentary majority, so the government is traditionally a coalition of several parties.</p>
<p>Thai business generally prefers a Democrat win because the party is seen to have the strongest economic team to tackle the troubled economy. The sector viewed the NAP as an incohesive party because it had many defectors from other parties.</p>
<p>Small parties were in big demand as potential coalition partners of the big two. The Chart Pattana Party of former premier Chatichai Choonhavan, which is expected to win more than 50 seats, was being wooed by the NAP and the Democrats.</p>
<p>Thailand's powerful military, which has engineered 17 successful or attempted coups since 1932 when absolute monarchy ended, reiterated its neutrality in the polls.</p>
