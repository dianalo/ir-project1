<p>MinFin bonds edged up on Thursday, echoing Western optimism after a U.S. Federal Open Market Committee decision not to change its rates last week, dealers said.</p>
<p>    tranche		 Feb 13		  Feb 12</p>
<p>    1999 maturity (3)   86.88-87.13	   86.60-86.80</p>
<p>    2003 maturity (4)   63.25-63.63	   63.15-63.15</p>
<p>    2008 maturity (5)   44.38-44.75	   44.10-44.40</p>
<p>    2006 maturity (6)   50.38-50.75	   50.20-50.50</p>
<p>    2011 maturity (7)   37.50-37.88	   37.30-37.60</p>
<p>&quot;The trend of small growth is continuing with tiny corrections during the day, mainly on Western demand,&quot; said a dealer with a major bank.</p>
<p>He said the recent FOMC decision not to change its rates was still affecting the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors have defined their priorities and are now forming their portfolios,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said there was a shortage of paper and most demand in tranche 3, 6 and 7.</p>
<p>The market lost some steam in the evening as prices stabilized and no clear direction emerged, an International Moscow Bank dealer said.</p>
<p>He said he saw narrowing spreads and a lot of choices, which meant the future trend was unclear.</p>
<p>He said the market was resting after a strong rise of about 0.5 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The other dealer forecast a further price rise with periodical corrections on hopes about Russia's second Eurobond issue planned for March and the closing of the London club re-scheduling at the end of March or start of April.</p>
