<p>Vietnam's President Le Duc Anh is lying in a coma at the Hanoi 108 Army Hospital after suffering a brain haemorrhage about nine days ago, medical sources said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Earlier in the week he'd been getting better, but in the last few days his condition became very serious,&quot; one source said, adding doctors were unwilling to operate on the 75-year-old general or move him as his condition was so bad.</p>
<p>That was at odds with a government source's comment on Saturday that Anh, one of the communist country's leadership troika, had begun to recover.</p>
<p>That source said said news reports indicating the situation was more serious were exaggerated and rumours that he was more seriously ill or had even died should not be believed.</p>
<p>There have been widely conflicting reports about Anh's condition over the past week.</p>
<p>Political sources and medical staff have said that Anh was paralysed down one side of his body by a stroke, while the government's only official comment has been that he is tired and is in need of some rest.</p>
<p>There has been no announcement that Anh's deputy, Nguyen Thi Binh will stand in -- constitutional procedure if the president is incapacitated -- or that any successor is being considered.</p>
<p>Anh, who holds a key position of influence over the military and security apparatus, is part of leadership triumvirate which includes Communist Party Secretary-General Do Muoi, 79, and reformist Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, 73.</p>
<p>Analysts say Anh's departure could reopen an internal debate over leadership succession which had simmered ahead of a key Communist Party congress earlier this year.</p>
