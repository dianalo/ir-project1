<p>Germany's new tax code would tighten rules on short-term gains from share and property sales while cutting company taxes for non-distributed profit and earnings, Bonn's tax work group said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1998, investors would be allowed to sell shares tax-free after holding them one year instead of six months, and property after 10 years instead of two, a commission member told Reuters.</p>
<p>The commission, which unveils its reform proposal Thursday evening, would also cut company tax to 28 percent for distributed earnings and to 40 percent for non-distributed profits, the member said.  </p>
<p>The new corporate tax rules would also go into effect in 1998, while the tax on life insurance profits would become effective immediately, the commission member said.</p>
<p>The proposals are part of a broad overhaul of Germany's heavy-handed tax code that has strained Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition.</p>
<p>After months of haggling between Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) and junior partner Free Democrats (FDU), the group reached a compromise last night on a package that lowers taxes by a net of 30 billion marks.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel is scheduled to introduce the proposal Thursday evening.</p>
