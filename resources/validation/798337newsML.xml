<p>A brouhaha at electronics giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Co over whether a member of the founding family should inherit the firm's top post has highlighted a growing contrast in management style with rival Sony Corp .</p>
<p>The controversy was sparked by an adviser to the firm, who said last month that vice president Masayuki Matsushita, the son of chairman Masaharu Matsushita, was &quot;inexperienced and not qualified&quot; to take over the leadership of what is one of the world's biggest consumer electronics and household appliance groups.</p>
<p>Matsushita produces the Panasonic, Technics and Quasar range of electronic goods and is a leading provider of small app, awash with cash and strong technological muscle,&quot; said Jardine Fleming analyst Masami Fujino. &quot;Unlike Sony, it works without strong leadership.&quot;</p>
<p>Sony and Matsushita, two of Japan's flagship companies, have pursued contrasting business strategies since 1995, after Matsushita failed in the film and game software business.</p>
<p>Matsushita was forced to sell a majority stake in Hollywood film maker MCA Inc in 1995, after a string of disagreements with MCA management, and was nudged out of the videogame market in 1996.</p>
<p>Since then it has focused its prowess on hardware manufacturing, particularly of advanced electronics parts such as displays and semiconductors.</p>
<p>Sony, on the other hand, is rapidly diversifying into music, films, videogames and broadcasting, while moving away from manufacturing.</p>
<p>Analysts agree that Matsushita's most serious problem is the slow pace of change.</p>
<p>&quot;Matsushita, after all, is too large to change quickly,&quot; said Takanobu Murakami, an analyst at Yamaichi Research Institute.</p>
<p>The difference between the two companies is also apparent in their profits and share prices.</p>
<p>While Matsushita is clearly recovering from a consumer electronics slump in the early 1990s, forecasting a net group profit of 152 billion yen ($1.31 billion) in the year to March 1998, up six-fold from four years ago, profits are still well below the peak of 259 billion yen ($2.23 billion) in 1990/91.</p>
<p>Sony, by contrast, rang up a record group net profit of 139.46 billion yen ($1.20 billion) in 1996/97, becoming a darling of investors in the stock market.</p>
<p>Sony's share price hit a record high of 12,600 yen on August 1. On that same day, Matsushita's shares traded up to 2,520 yen, their highest in nearly eight years, but were still well below their 1988 record of 3,070 yen.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Sony shares closed at 11,600 yen, up 200 yen, while Matsushita closed at 2,380 yen, up 20 yen. ($1=116 yen)</p>
