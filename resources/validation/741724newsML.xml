<p>Mother Teresa returned on Sunday from her first trip abroad after recovering from serious illness last year and headed back to Calcutta to resume her work with the poor.</p>
<p>The 86-year-old Roman Catholic nun, back from her first trip after she stepped down as the head of the Calcutta-based religious order she founded, said she was feeling good and was very pleased with her trip.</p>
<p>&quot;Very good, it was very good,&quot; she told Reuters in New Delhi after arriving from her two-month-long trip that included visits to Rome, Poland and the United States.</p>
<p>When asked how was she feeling, the gentle nun known as the saint of the gutters for her work with the poor and the destitutes said: &quot;Good! very good!...I introduced Sister Nirmala to Pope.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the main purpose of her visit to Rome was to formally introduce Sister Nirmala, her successor as superior-general of the Missionaries of Charity, to Pope John Paul.</p>
<p>The silver-haired nun was forced to step down as head of her religious order in March as she battled against heart disease.</p>
<p>Sister Nirmala took over as the head of the Missionaries of Charity when Mother Teresa stepped down after being admitted to hospital three times last year for emergency care and heart surgery.</p>
<p>She was accompanied by four other nuns and her doctor Patricia Aubanel on the trip.</p>
<p>Aubanel, who was part of the team that carried out Mother Teresa's three heart operations in 1991, 1993 and 1996, said the frail nun had coped well with the trip.</p>
<p>&quot;She tolerated the trip very well,&quot; said Aubanel.</p>
<p>The 1979 Nobel peace laureate, wearing her traditional white and blue saree, blessed and smiled at onlookers as she was taken in a wheelchair to a waiting car.</p>
<p>She left for the eastern city of Calcutta.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa initiated a group of new nuns into her renowned missionary order at a church ceremony in Rome.</p>
<p>She also accepted an award from the U.S. Congress for her lifetime of service to the world's least powerful and influential during her visit to the U.S.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa, whose recent tours outside India had been marred by ill health, held up well on the visit barring a brief illness on her arrival at Rome airport.</p>
<p>On a visit to Europe in 1993, she injured three ribs in a fall. On a trip to the United States in 1991, she fell ill midway through the visit and had to undergo the first of her three heart operations.</p>
