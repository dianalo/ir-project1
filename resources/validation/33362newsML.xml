<p>New Zealand Labour leader Helen Clark has welcomed Alliance leader Jim Anderton's statement that he would be prepared to conditionally support a minority Labour government after next month's election.</p>
<p>She said in an interview with Reuters she was prepared to include the left-wing Alliance in policy negotiations, a key Anderton condition, once it had committed itself to supporting Labour on confidence votes.  </p>
<p>It is widely expected Labour and economic nationalist New Zealand First would be able to strike a deal after the October 12 election, but on current polling trends they would need the support of the Alliance to oust the ruling conservative National-United coalition and to stay in power.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the first bridge the Alliance has to cross is indicating what government it will give its vote of confidence to, and they have clearly ruled out National,&quot; Clark said.</p>
<p>&quot;Having given a vote of confidence to Labour I think then they do have a very real interest in input into policy and a legitimate one and I would welcome that.&quot;  </p>
<p>She said the Alliance's position was &quot;inevitable&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;For all the rhetoric there are areas where they are wholeheartedly in agreement with us -- on housing policy and the Employment Contracts Act, for instance.&quot;</p>
<p>She said a Labour government was &quot;more than possible&quot;. The polls had consistently given a majority to the parties which were not the natural partners of National, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;So the only way National can be sustained in government is for the Alliance to back them, and they were very specific in ruling that out. That is their role. There is no precedent for parties like the Alliance on the left of the main social democratic party supporting a party on the right to form a government.&quot;</p>
<p>Clark added: &quot;The question of whether New Zealand First will support National is more of an open question. If it throws its vote of confidence with Labour we will make it. If it throws it with National we won't. It is as simple as that.&quot;</p>
<p>She said she favoured a minority Labour government &quot;but our support would have to come up a bit for that to happen&quot;.</p>
<p>She said at the moment Labour had no relations with either NZ First or the Alliance.  </p>
<p>&quot;We don't have any. It is one of the myths put about by (Prime Minister Jim) Bolger that we have some kind of agreement. We don't&quot;.</p>
<p>She also dismissed suggestions the right of the Labour caucus may split and support National after the election.</p>
<p>&quot;If they did switch, it would in essence be the end of their career in politics. I don't think it's a real possibility.&quot;</p>
