<p>Govett Global Smaller Companies Investment Trust plc said on Friday it had finalised plans for unitisation, and would seek shareholder approval to create two unit trusts to manage the current portfolio.</p>
<p>It said its board had decided to offer shareholders a choice of units in a unit trust with an investment policy similar to that of the trust, or in a unit trust investing in cash or near-cash instruments.</p>
<p>Warrantholders would receive a fixed cash payment of 20 pence per warrant -- a 25 percent premium to the average price of the ten days to July 24.</p>
<p>Govett first announced the plans in early June amid concern about the trust trading at deep discounts to net asset value.</p>
<p>The proposals provide for the company to be put into voluntary liquidation and the transfer of its investments to the two unit trusts.</p>
<p>Shareholders will be able to exchange their holdings of shares for one, or a combination, of the two unit trusts -- the Govett Global Strategy Fund and the Govett Cash Fund.</p>
<p>Shareholders seeking a cash exit will be able to redeem their GCF Units for cash immediately after their issue.</p>
<p>Net assets of the trust at July 23 were 21.05 million stg and the unaudited net asset value per share was 96.9 pence a share. The discount to net asset value was about nine percent.</p>
<p>It estimated the cost of cancelling the warrants would be about four pence per share and that total other expenses will absorb about three pence.</p>
<p>Extraordinary general meetings to vote on the proposals are planned for August 18 and 27.</p>
