<p>The leaders of Canada and the European Union (EU) will sign an action plan on Tuesday to tighten relations and press for freer trade, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jean Chretien's office announced a hastily arranged Tuesday meeting with Irish Prime Minister John Bruton, who holds the rotating EU presidency, and European Commission Vice President Sir Leon Brittan.</p>
<p>Canada has long pushed for a transatlantic free trade agreement to provide a substantive rationale for good relations in the absence of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Officials said such an agreement remained the long-term goal and could be examined under the Canada-EU Political Declaration and Action Plan. But meanwhile they would look at other ways of liberalising trade short of a free-trade deal.</p>
<p>&quot;The ultimate goal is a free trade agreement, but what we're trying to do now is further liberalisation of trade,&quot; one senior Canadian official said.</p>
<p>The agreement will not be just about trade. It will help broaden cooperation in a full range of issues from science and technology to immigration and Bosnia.</p>
<p>The two sides finally agreed on the text of the plan during transatlantic phone and fax contacts on Friday, and the deal was approved by the European foreign ministers in Dublin on Friday evening.</p>
<p>The two sides scrambled to arrange a meeting, conveniently setting it in Ottawa on Tuesday because Bruton and Brittan were already to be in Washington on Monday.</p>
<p>Relations between Canada and the EU were set back for about a year in the spring of 1995 when both sides were locked in a fierce dispute in the North Atlantic over the rights to fish off Canada's coast for scarce turbot.</p>
<p>Spain was the main EU protagonist, and it only cleared the way to a reference relating to fisheries as the result of a meeting in Lisbon between Chretien and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar about 10 days ago.</p>
<p>Another clause on labour standards was cleared as the result of language agreed last week during the World Trade Organisation (WTO) meeting in Singapore.</p>
<p>The Canadian-EU deal paralleled an accord signed between the United States and the EU in Madrid a year ago.</p>
<p>Officials said the United States did not seem keen at this point to move ahead with a free trade deal, and on the EU side countries like France were likely to resist free trade in agriculture.</p>
