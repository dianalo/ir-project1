<p>China's Finance Ministry is considering establishing a treasury bond market-maker system to promote public trading in state debt, the Shanghai Securities News said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Under the system, the ministry would require major banks and securities houses to maintain a certain volume of trading and work to keep stable prices on the T-bond secondary or public trading market, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The ministry is also making efforts to set up a national T-bond clearing system to cope with increasing demand for T-bond trading on the secondary market, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Establishing a national clearing system and a market-maker system is aimed at supplying better services for individuals to trade on the secondary market,&quot; the newspaper quoted unnamed sources at the ministry as saying.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the ministry was considering the new moves after the successful implementation of a number of reforms to the T-bond primary or issue market this year, prompting the need for the further development of the secondary market.  </p>
<p>The most outstanding feature of the reforms was the use of public tender system for most issues, which brought coupons of state debt closer to market needs and ensured a smooth issue, the newspaper quoted the sources as saying.</p>
<p>The ministry is also looking into setting up special T-bond investment funds to enable individuals to invest on the secondary market through the funds, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>It will gradually introduce a unified way of calculating T-bond prices and yields to lead the the secondary market settlement system in comformity with international practice, the newspaper said, but giving no details.</p>
<p>China issued a total of 220 billion yuan T-bonds this year, the third successive year of record state debt issues.</p>
<p>Treasury bills and bonds have been best sellers this year due to falling inflation and lower bank interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The Finance Ministry as the issuer and manager of state debt is optimistic about the prospects of the development of the T-bond secondary market,&quot; the newspaper quoted the sources as saying.</p>
