<headline>IMM currency futures finish mixed, pound sags. [CORRECTED 23:00 GMT]</headline>

<text>
<p>IMM currency futures ended pit trading mixed, with the pound taking a late tumble to the minus side.</p>
<p>Sterling slumped hard during the final half-hour, slapped down from lofty morning heights after Bank of England Governor Eddie George said during a visit to Lisbon that the speed of sterling's rise since autumn suggested the rise might not persist.</p>
<p>The comment sent March sterling futures skidding by some $0.0100 (Corrects from $0.000100) to the day's low of $1.6460 from its perch near $1.6562, just shy of day's peak, minutes earlier.  </p>
<p>But floor brokers said even that big swing, which briefly drew power from sell stops, occurred on relatively skimpy volume, which typically dries up after Europe closes.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, it (volume) wasn't as heavy as it should have been,&quot; said one floor broker, noting that the price boards showed estimated volume of roughly 15,000 sterling, 32,000 yen, 40,000 Swiss francs and 30,000 marks for Wednesday.</p>
<p>Brokers looked ahead to Thursday's November U.S. consumer price index, expected to rise 0.3 percent overall and gain 0.2 percent excluding food and energy.  </p>
<p>But the retail-level inflation figures might need to stray far from estimates to provoke much response, especially after the muted reaction to Wednesday's tame producer price index.</p>
<p>Instead, they expected attention could remain riveted -- at least temporarily -- on the U.S. stock and bond markets, both of which slumped on Wednesday and lifted currencies.</p>
<p>But brokers voiced differing opinions about whether the dollar's recent rise will resume.</p>
<p>One broker said the unit appeared poised on the cusp of a move lower especially if it breaches some key technical levels and makes &quot;weak&quot; dollar longs flock for the exits at yearend.  </p>
<p>Indeed, March Swiss francs briefly shot higher through resistance near $0.7690 when U.S. stocks opened sharply lower.</p>
<p>Currencies rose as U.S. Treasuries slid after a Wall Street Journal article said traders are worried Japanese institutions may slow their purchases of U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>Currencies also fretted about another WSJ article that said a Smith Barney survey shows that as many as 40 percent of mutual-fund holders would sell some or all of their holdings if the stock market fell 15 percent in a short period.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar fell after a surprise 50-basis-point rate cut by the Australian central bank.  </p>
<p>At settlement, March yen rose $0.000029 to $0.008968, marks rose $0.0063 to $0.6540, Swiss franc jumped $0.0090 to $0.7699, Sterling eased $0.0008 to $1.6480, Canadian dollar lost $0.0015 to $0.7393, Australian dollar dropped $0.0105 to $0.7892, and the Mexican peso fell $0.000575 to $0.120075.
