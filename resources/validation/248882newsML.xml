<p>Chechens on Wednesday marked the second anniversary of Russia's failed military campaign to crush their independence bid but their celebrations, overshadowed by the region's economic ruin, were low-key.</p>
<p>&quot;Our republic is ruined but we are free,&quot; Aslan Maskhadov, head of the Chechen government, told a military parade of around 400 rebel fighters on the outskirts of the capital Grozny.</p>
<p>&quot;When we started our struggle two years ago we were very few but our ranks grew and grew. It has taken us a long time to reach this day,&quot; said Maskhadov, one of 19 candidates now running for the Chechen presidency.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin sent thousands of Russian troops, backed by tanks and combat planes, into the tiny oil-rich region on December 11 1994 to &quot;restore constitutional order&quot;.</p>
<p>Now the last servicemen are trickling out of Chechnya, leaving behind thousands of dead comrades, tens of thousands of dead civilians and a devastated land firmly in the hands of the separatists Russia had tried to subdue.</p>
<p>Another top candidate in the presidential contest, which will take place on January 27 along with parliamentary elections, is rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, who also addressed a rally on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us always honour the memory of those who died for the independence of the Chechen republic of Ichkeria,&quot; Yandarbiyev told a crowd of 1,500 people in central Grozny. Ichkeria is the name the Chechen separatists give to their region.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall restore everything that has been ruined but nobody can bring back those who gave their lives,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The general mood in the capital, much of it still devastated by long months of Russian shelling, was quiet and businesslike, with shops and markets open as usual.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has admitted that the decision to send troops into Chechnya could have been the biggest mistake of his life. The Kremlin's political and military drubbing at the hands of the lightly armed but determined rebels was a humiliating defeat.</p>
<p>Under an August 31 peace deal that halted 21 months of fighting Moscow and the separatist leaders agreed to put off by five years a decision on Chechnya's future political status. But the rebels make little secret that they want independence.</p>
<p>Moscow is now trying to keep Chechnya within the Russian Federation by providing economic incentives and has mooted the idea of setting up a free trade zone in the region.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya, Ivan Rybkin, said last weekend that preparations for the January polls were progressing smoothly.</p>
<p>But political analysts say that organising voting by some 400,000 refugees who fled Chechnya during the war -- about half the population -- will pose a big problem.</p>
<p>Most refugees, many of whom are staying with relatives in neighbouring Russian regions, have no papers to prove that they lived in Chechnya before the conflict.</p>
<p>Russia's leading human rights campaigner Sergei Kovalyov has called for the elections to be postponed due to the confusion.</p>
<p>The 19 presidential candidates, who also include field commander Shamil Basayev whose fighters held hundreds of hostages in the Russian town of Budennovsk last year, must present petitions signed by at least 10,000 supporters in order to get their names on the ballot.</p>
