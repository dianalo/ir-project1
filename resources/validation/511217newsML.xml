<p>Italy received encouraging words from one major economic body on Tuesday in its battle to qualify for a single European currency but appeared to get a warning from another key organisation.</p>
<p>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said heavily indebted Italy was &quot;within reach&quot; of meeting key goals laid out in the Maastricht Treaty for founder members of European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>A report by the Paris-based group said Prime Minister Romano Prodi faced a daunting task as he tried to halve Italy's budget deficit this year to meet one of the key EMU criteria but added:</p>
<p>&quot;Such a reduction is not unprecedented among OECD economies.&quot;</p>
<p>Prodi's centre-left government has introduced a string of tough budget moves over the past 12 months in a bid to wrestle the deficit down to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from 6.7 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>The OECD said many of the measures introduced so far had been tax hikes or financial operations and urged the government to embark on structural spending cuts to keep a lid on the deficit in coming years.</p>
<p>However, the annual report of the European Monetary Institute (EMI) lashed out at one-off measures to reduce deficit to GDP ratios, saying they &quot;cannot be regarded as contributing to sustainability&quot;.</p>
<p>The forerunner of a European Central Bank said heavy reliance on higher revenues rather than spending cuts to rein in deficits was &quot;a ground for concern&quot;.</p>
<p>While not mentioning any countries by name, many analysts took the remarks to be aimed at Italy, among others.</p>
<p>Only about one year remains before the European Commission reaches a final decision, based on 1997 data, on which EU states would qualify for EMU.</p>
<p>Prodi said in an interview published on Monday that he was confident Italy would meet the strict Maastricht parameters, adding that Italians knew that joining European monetary union was &quot;a battle that counts for centuries&quot;.</p>
<p>The prime minister told Time magazine that if Italy failed to join from the start: &quot;I would feel compelled to resign.&quot;</p>
<p>Aware of unease in the EMI and Germany over the methods being used to get Italy to the starting line for a single currency, Prodi has pledged to introduce an overhaul of the politically sensitive welfare state before the end of the year.</p>
<p>While Italy's social spending is slightly less than the EU average, analysts say the system is unbalanced, with too much money being channelled into generous state pensions. As the population ages, this represents a budget time bomb.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is committed to start examining this over the coming weeks,&quot; Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But analysts said the main problem for Italy remained the huge servicing costs on its debt mountain. &quot;The crucial point is interest spending,&quot; said Andrea Conti, an analyst with Deutsche Bank in Milan.</p>
<p>The more the markets believe that Italy will lower its deficit, the more interest rates will fall and the OECD said Italy could expect significant interest savings this year as the country's economic credibility improved.</p>
<p>It called on Prodi and Ciampi to stick to their guns.</p>
<p>&quot;The task faced by macroeconomic policies is unusually demanding and, with the outcome remaining subject to considerable uncertainty, success requires a sustained policy effort, to which the government is committed,&quot; the OECD added.</p>
