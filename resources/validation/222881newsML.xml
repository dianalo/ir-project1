<title>USA: Year-end pitfalls await fund investors.</title>
<headline>Year-end pitfalls await fund investors.</headline>

<p>The average stock fund has climbed nearly 19.8 percent since the end of 1995 -- and the year isn't over yet. Typically, the funds that record the biggest gains during a good year for stocks also draw the most new investors, and this year should be no different.</p>
<p>Trouble is, many of those investors are stepping squarely into a tax trap that could cost them sizable sums. If you invest in a fund that delivered big gains earlier this year, you might have to pay taxes on those gains -- even though you didn't share in the fund's profits.</p>
<p>Here's what you need to know to avoid that trap. In late December, many equity and income funds will make year-end distributions of capital gains earned during the past year. Some funds also will make year-end income distributions.</p>
<p>Now, assume you invest in a fund trading at $21 a share just before it makes its yearly capital gains distribution. Assume that the distribution equals $1. When the distribution is made, the share price will decline from $21 to $20, and you will receive a $1 payment for each share you own. Your total holdings -- the fund shares ($20) and the distribution cash ($1) -- still equal the original $21.</p>
<p>But here's the rub: You now owe taxes on the $1 distribution -- even though the distribution represents part of your original $21 investment.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, some brokers will even try to get you to buy a fund just before a distribution by arguing that you will get a quick dividend to boost your returns. But the only thing you'll boost will be your tax bill.</p>
<p>Before you invest in a fund's shares, call the sponsor and find out when it plans to make a capital gains or income distribution. Then ask them to give you an estimate of how large the distribution will likely be. Finally, ask for the &quot;date of record&quot; for the distribution. You can buy shares after that date without worrying that you'll owe taxes on the distribution.</p>
<p>That phone call could save you a lot of money, especially if you're checking out a fund that has performed very well during the past year. But even a fund that has delivered average gains can be a tax trap for investors. For example, T. Rowe Price Science &amp; Technology Fund (800-638-5660; $2,500 minimum investment; no load) has gained 18 percent so far this year. It will make a projected payout of $3.50 per share on Dec. 27. Assuming the share price remains stable around $34, an investor who puts $5,000 to work in the fund on Dec. 24, 1996 -- just before its distribution date -- will receive a distribution of about $514. If he or she is in the 40 percent combined federal and state tax bracket, that could amount to a $205 tax bill next year.</p>
<p>Some funds will make smaller distributions, of course, and they are not likely to saddle you with such a large tax bill. But who wants to pay taxes -- no matter how small the amount -- on another investor's profits?</p>
