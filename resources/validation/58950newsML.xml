<headline>Service Corp. makes $2 billion bid for Loewe.</headline>
<dateline>HOUSTON 1996-09-17</dateline>

<p>North America's top funeral home operator, Service Corp. International, Tuesday made an unsolicited bid valued at $2 billion Tuesday for No. 2, Canada's Loewen Group Inc.</p>
<p>Loewen, whose stock rose sharply on U.S. and Canadian stock markets after Service Corp. proposed a stock swap valuing Loewen at $43 a share, said its board would review the bid.</p>
<p>Houston-based Service Corp. said it might raise its bid, which was based on public information, after reviewing Loewen's confidential information.</p>
<p>With 48 million common shares in Vancouver-based Loewen outstanding as of April 1, the $43-a-share offer would be valued at about $2 billion.</p>
<p>Service Corp. said the offer was made in a letter to Loewen Chief Executive Raymond Loewen after it failed to get a response to repeated calls to Raymond Loewen's office starting Sept. 11.</p>
<p>&quot;This proposal will create a combined company with unparalleled resources,&quot; Service Corp. Chief Executive Robert Waltrip said in a statement.</p>
<p>If completed, the merger would result in a company operating about 3,750 funeral homes and 600 cemeteries around the world, Service Corp. said.</p>
<p>Service Corp. operated 2,832 funeral homes, 331 cemeteries and 146 crematoria as of June 30.</p>
<p>Service Corp. said the combination would raise earnings.</p>
<p>The offer boosted Loewen stock, which rose $7.65 to $54.15 ($39.45) in afternoon trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Service Corp., however, was unchanged at $30.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading in the stock was halted for the announcement.</p>
<p>Both companies have been buying privately owned funeral homes in the United States and Canada. In June, Loewen teamed up with investment bank Blackstone Group to buy Prime Succession Inc., the largest privately held funeral home operator in the United States, for $295 million.</p>
<p>Wall Street takeover traders, however, hurt recently by a slew of unsolicited bids that failed to materialise, reacted warily to Tuesday's development. Although Loewen's stock rose, it remained well below Service Corp.'s bid.</p>
<p>Traders cited uncertainty about whether Service Corp. would be willing to pursue a hostile takeover if its offer were rejected.</p>
