<p>The outlook for Nordic forestries may be brightening, but analysts do not expect runaway gains overall, saying that even though forestry stocks have lagged behind local markets, they already reflect optimism.</p>
<p>Market pulp prices are rising, sales volumes have gathered pace, price increases for some grades are tabled for autumn and strength in the dollar and sterling is helping some earnings.</p>
<p>Further, signs of optimism from Stora and Metsa-Serla in H1 reports this week have given shine to forestries -- their indices up over one percent in Sweden and more than two percent in Finland on Thursday.</p>
<p>More reports are due from UPM-Kymmene, Enso, AssiDoman, SCA and MoDo next week.</p>
<p>Forecasts vary widely with individual factors, like asset sales at UPM, weighing heavily in the numbers for each company.</p>
<p>But the fundamental view seems to be that the sector is on the brink of recovery from a sudden downturn, after a boom yielded record profits for many in 1995.</p>
<p>However, with no one expecting clear profit gains until 1998 and 1999 and a number of variables clouding the exact earnings picture for that time, investors have been holding off.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are not ready to pay a fair price so soon,&quot; said Jaakko Niemela at Opstock Securities, adding that he felt there was a risk long-range forecasts may be downgraded.</p>
<p>A key reason the forest sector is running at a discount is sustained fears among investors of the risk an upturn may trigger a capacity boom, analysts say.</p>
<p>&quot;We aren't willing to pound the table on the sector overall, as most stocks look optimistically valued,&quot; said Hakan Ostling at Goldman Sachs in London, pointing to selective picks which for him would mainly focus on packaging grades.</p>
<p>Many forestry stocks, dogged by doubts on the cycle, have this year lagged behind local markets: moves in the Finnish and Swedish forest indices and have recently started to track the general indices but remain clearly behind.</p>
<p>Analysts say Finnish firms particularly have relatively low valuations and have underperformed -- for example UPM, Europe's largest forestry group, is lagging the Helsinki HEX index by about five percent on the year.</p>
<p>Not that forestry stocks have lost money: prices have risen by between 20 and 40 percent over the year.</p>
<p>Yet held against high-tech darlings like Ericsson or Nokia which are already putting in double-digit profit growth, it is easy to see forestries may lack appeal for investors.</p>
<p>Lars Kjellberg at Credit Suisse First Boston was hopeful forestries could gather pace as the sector turns up again, but stressed the upside potential lay also in mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally I'd say at this stage in the cycle they (forestry stocks) should be in-line or better than the market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Niemela saw scant chance that positive earnings surprises next week could trigger a major rally.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they might be quite positive but it's not enough to give any upward momentum to the shares,&quot; he said.</p>
