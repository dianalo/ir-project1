<p>The International Coffee Organization (ICO) will assist the market in exploring new centres of consumption and in creating niches in existing ones, ICO Executive Director Celsius Lodder said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;My view is that the ICO has to remain flexible, should seek the widest possible consensus and must build upon the co-operation that we have achieved with trade experts,&quot; said Lodder, who was addressing a two-day F.O. Licht World Coffee conference.</p>
<p>&quot;You can expect a proactive, analytical and flexible approach from the Organization.&quot;</p>
<p>The ICO would help promote quality coffee through a special Gourmet coffee project and, on the production side, it was pooling research findings on combatting the coffee berry borer.</p>
<p>Outside the established markets, the ICO had a vision of coffee becoming the predominant beverage in developing country markets as well, which would secure future sales.</p>
<p>Lodder said the ICO was aware the coffee market was increasingly dependent on risk management as trade participants and consumers reduced stocks in the wake of the 1994 price explosion.</p>
<p>As a result, the private sector at origin needed to hold more stocks and this was adding to their costs.</p>
<p>The ICO needed to address ensuing problems -- coffee being stored in remote areas and in unsuitable warehouses as consumers, for the time being, appeared unlikely to abandon their just-in-time strategy.</p>
<p>Lodder in a quesiton-and-answer session said it was unlikely the U.S., which pulled out of the 55-member ICO in 1993, would return.</p>
