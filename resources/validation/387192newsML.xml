<p>Members of South Africa's ruling ANC called on Wednesday for the head of rugby union boss Louis Luyt, alleging he tried to cover up the racism scandal which led Springbok coach Andre Markgraaff to quit his post.</p>
<p>&quot;We call on Luyt, president of rugby, to resign with immediate effect,&quot; Lulu Xingwana, chairwoman of a parliamentary committee on sports policy, told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;He knew, and decided to keep quiet about, the disgusting racial incident involving Markgraaff as early as November 30, 1996. We firmly believe he tried to cover up,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Markgraaff quit on Tuesday after acknowledging that he had used the term &quot;fucking kaffirs&quot; about black sports administrators in a telephone conversation taped without his knowledge.</p>
<p>The coach said he learned of the tape's existence in November and told Luyt about it then. Luyt has said he learned only in recent days of the racist remarks on the tape.</p>
<p>The man slurred by Markgraaff came to the defence of the game in Johannesburg on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mluleki George, the senior vice-president of the South African Rugby Football Union said: &quot;South Africa lived under racism for centuries and it would be naive to think that it would disappear overnight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I deal with this issue every day in my position as chairman of the National Sports Council and it happens in many other sports as well, such as netball and athletics.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a challenge to all right-thinking South Africans and the best way is not to deny that it exists but to commit ourselves to eradicating it,&quot; George told reporters.</p>
<p>Despite the Markgraaff scandal, South African rugby appeared to flirt with the added embarrassment of a commission of inquiry on Wednesday by hinting it would not cooperate with a government probe of alleged financial irregularities.</p>
<p>The SARFU executive committee was due to meet sports minister Steve Tshwete in Cape Town on Friday, when the scope of the task force investigation would be outlined.</p>
<p>However, the presence of a member of the National Olympic Committee of South Africa (NOCSA) in the task force has angered SARFU. The Union are not members of NOCSA nor is rugby an Olympic sport.</p>
<p>A SARFU spokesman told Reuters earlier on Wednesday that the meeting would probably not take place, prompting Tshwete's office to hint at serious consequences.</p>
<p>This could well have included SARFU's worst-case scenario of a commission of inquiry.</p>
<p>Later on Wednesday, the SARFU executive relented, albeit rather sniffily, and said it would attend.</p>
<p>&quot;The executive committee said that the delegation is not attending the meeting because we are threatened by a commission. SARFU is attending the meeting because we are displaying that we have nothing to hide whatsoever in South African rugby,&quot; the embattled Union said in a statement.</p>
