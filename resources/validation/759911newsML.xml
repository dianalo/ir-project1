<title>USA: Dollar highest against mark since Berlin Wall fell.</title>
<headline>Dollar highest against mark since Berlin Wall fell.</headline>

<p>The dollar rose Monday to its highest level against the German mark since the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p>The dollar also gained against the British pound amid uncertainty over British interest rates and climbed to its highest level against the Japanese yen in 2-1/2 months.</p>
<p>The dollar has risen almost 20 percent against the mark this year on concerns that the planned single European currency would be weaker than expected and persistent weakness in the German economy.</p>
<p>The dollar's rise vs. the German currency has accelerated recently as investors have gained confidence that the U.S. economy was growing steadily with little inflation.</p>
<p>Traders said the dollar's rally probably had further to go.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still a continuing move higher and I think it can run to 1.85 to 1.90 marks,&quot; said Tom Benfer, director of foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal, adding that the rally would continue if key economic reports due this week contained no surprises.</p>
<p>Late Monday in New York, the dollar stood at 1.8440 marks after earlier hitting 1.8490, its highest level since November 1989. The dollar closed at 1.8378 marks on Friday.</p>
<p>The mark's weakness when the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989 stemmed from concerns that the currency would be weakened by unification with what was then East Germany, and lose its status as one of Europe's strongest currencies.</p>
<p>The U.S. economic reports start on Tuesday with the release of the second quarter index of employment costs, a key barometer of inflation. That will be followed by the first estimate of second quarter gross domestic product on Thursday and July's employment data on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;People want to be careful because they don't want to see any surprises,&quot; Benfer said. &quot;If the inflation number picks up a bit that may help the dollar but it will not be good for the bond and stock markets.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traders said heavy profit-taking in the pound and concerns that British interest rates would not rise soon, as some had expected, knocked the pound lower against the mark. Investor selling of pounds for marks also indirectly stemmed the dollar's rally vs. the German currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The (sterling) market was well overbought, so in that type of situation the risk is to the downside,&quot; said James Powers, vice president at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale.</p>
<p>The pound also fell to $1.6327 from $1.6640.</p>
<p>Dealers speculating that the dollar would soon reach 2 marks also boosted the U.S. currency.</p>
<p>The dollar's rally has also been fed by concerns that the euro, the planned single European currency, would be weaker than the German unit. The fear that some European countries would fail to meet tight fiscal guidelines for the planned single currency has heightened investors' concerns, dealers said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the dollar broke through 117 Japanese yen and stood at 117.87 yen late in New Yori, its highest level in 2-1/2 months, and up from 116.95 late on Friday.</p>
<p>The dollar edged lower to 1.5150 Swiss francs from 1.5160 on Friday. It rose to Canadian $1.3859 from C$1.3847.</p>
