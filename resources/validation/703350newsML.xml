<p>German shares surged to a new record high at the outset of bourse dealings on Wednesday, catching up to Tuesday's late IBIS session gains tied to overnight Wall Street gains and the dollar above 1.74 marks.</p>
<p>Traders expected the DAX index to keep up the advance due to fresh buy orders but said market may face consolidation and bouts of profit-taking in the near-term.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX was up 29.87 points at 3,849.72 points after setting a new record high at 3,871.13 points.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to see whether more fresh buy orders show up this morning. The volumes have been relatively thin,&quot; said one Frankfurt trader. &quot;If we don't see some new action, the market is certainly going to come under some pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>Gains may also be limited due to cautious trading ahead of the Federal Reserve releasing the results of its FOMC policy meeting later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX in late afternoon dealings on Tuesday surged toward all-time high levels, fuelled by gains on Wall Street and the dollar holding onto its gains.</p>
<p>The German market has also found strength from investors taking a renewed interest in the chemical sector and Hoechst AG, which rose nearly six percent on buy recommendations from some brokerage houses.</p>
<p>&quot;The chemicals are still in demand this morning but they are due for some consolidation after Tuesday,&quot; said a trader. &quot;The uptrend, however, is still there and the shares have only just begun to climb.&quot;</p>
<p>Hoechst rose 15 pfennigs to 78.45 marks, while BASF was up 49 pfennigs at 66.55 marks and Bayer was up 70 at 70.85.</p>
<p>Banking shares were also in the spotlight on Wednesday, in part due to the higher dollar, traders said.</p>
<p>Detusche Bank AG helped lead the advance and reached a new all-time high at 105.35 marks in bourse dealings. Deutsche shares were later up 2.70 marks at 104.75 marks.</p>
<p>Banking rivals Commerzbank AG and Dresdner Bank AG were also higher, with Commerzbank up 95 pfennigs at 50.10 marks and Dresdner up 1.25 pfennigs at 62.50 marks.</p>
