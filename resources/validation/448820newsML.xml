<p>Four people died in a suspected overnight arson attack on a cafe in the Belgian capital which burned down a six-storey building, police said on Monday.</p>
<p>A police spokesman told a Reuter correspondent on the scene the death toll rose to four after two bodies were found in a stairwell. The victims apparently died as they tried to escape.</p>
<p>Police were treating the fire in the Brussels commune of Molenbeek as suspicious. Belga news agency said neighbours had heard the sound of breaking glass and screeching car tyres shortly before the blaze.</p>
<p>BRTN radio said an explosion had been heard. The speed with which the fire raged through the building also pointed to a petrol bomb attack.</p>
<p>The station said four suspects had been arrested. The motives for the attack on the cafe, where there had been problems with drugs and gambling, were unclear.</p>
