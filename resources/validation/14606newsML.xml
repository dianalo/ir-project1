<p>A 12-year-old Florida boy hanged himself in his backyard just hours before he was due to start at a new school on Monday, police said.</p>
<p>Samuel Graham, who told his family earlier that he was nervous about starting at a new school because he feared teasing about his weight problem, had been due to spend his first day at Parkway Middle School Monday, police said.</p>
<p>The boy was last seen alive Sunday night when he joined his two younger brothers and father in a bedtime prayer. Two younger brothers found him hanging from a tree early Monday morning. His father cut him down and tried to revive him but paramedics pronounced him dead when they arrived.</p>
<p>The Broward County Sheriff's Office found a step stool and a flashlight under the tree where the boy was hanged. They said there was no sign of foul play and that investigators believed the death was a suicide.</p>
