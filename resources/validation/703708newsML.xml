<headline>HK chief gets mixed, cautious press on policy plans.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-07-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hong Kong newspaper editorials ranged from praise to caution on Wednesday on chief executive Tung Chee-hwa's inaugural speech setting a policy blueprint for this newly-autonomous region of China.</p>
<p>On the first day of Hong Kong's reversion to Beijing rule, the post-colonial leader proposed initiatives in housing, education and economic policy fields.</p>
<p>Some of his aims were too ambitious, the English-language South China Morning Post said. &quot;He has an inspiring vision for the SAR (Special Administrative Region), but some goals may be elusive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There were times when his words had the ring of a politician seeking election, rather than a leader who has the future of 6.3 million people in his hands,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The chief executive's views were shared by the Hong Kong people, but he might find it difficult to put substance into form, the English-language Hong Kong Standard said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is in bringing this vision to reality that there are some doubts,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Chinese language newspapers echoed this view.</p>
<p>&quot;The 'One country, two systems' concept is encouraging, but there is still a long and harsh way to put it into reality,&quot; Ming Pao Daily News said. &quot;There is no need for either pessimism or praise-singing.&quot;</p>
<p>Pro-China newspapers however exuded optimism.</p>
<p>Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong-based Beijing mouthpiece, hailed Tung's speech as a foundation for continued prosperity, under a headline, &quot;Hong Kong will have a better tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hong Kong people absolutely have the power and wisdom to plan Hong Kong's future,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Other newspapers said Tung gave only a brief sketch of his future policy on issues.</p>
<p>&quot;He did not say much about concrete measures,&quot; the Apple Daily said.</p>
<p>&quot;The speech might disappoint those who had expected a major announcement from him,&quot; it said.</p>
