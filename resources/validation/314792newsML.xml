<p>The Brazilian economy will offer few surprises in 1997 and the government will make little headway with its &quot;twin deficits&quot; in trade and fiscal accounts, ING Barings said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;From an economic standpoint, 1997 promises to resemble 1996 in various aspects: inflation will decline somewhat more, the economy will grow moderately and there will be no dramatic changes in macroeconomic policy,&quot; ING said in the report.</p>
<p>&quot;Brazil's 'twin deficits' - fiscal and foreign trade - are unlikely to be alleviated,&quot; ING (corrects from Schneider) said in the report.  </p>
<p>ING forecasts a public sector operational deficit, which includes interest payments, of 4.0 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, down slightly from an estimated 4.5 percent of gdp in 1996.</p>
<p>The bank forecasts a 1997 trade deficit of $6.0 billion, up from an estimated $5.0 billion in 1996.</p>
<p>ING also commented on the following issues:</p>
<p>* RE-ELECTION - President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's bid to push through a constitutional amendment allowing his re-election stood a very good chance of succeeding, although it might take longer than expected.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is no effective opposition to the Cardoso administration's push for a re-election amendment... There is little enthusiasm among legislators for mounting a systematic opposition to the government when there is no alternative to the political power that the Cardoso administration possesses.&quot;</p>
<p>* INFLATION - ING said inflation should continue to fall and Brazil's varied inflation indicies should move toward convergence. &quot;On the demand side the main contributor to lower inflation has been the continued deindexation of wages and salaries.&quot;  </p>
<p>ING added: &quot;Few labor unions have managed to secure wage agreements from private-sector companies that compensate workers for past inflation... This situation should not change.&quot;</p>
<p>* CAPITAL FLOWS - ING noted that despite deterioration in trade and current accounts, the capital account of the balance of payments has improved over the past 12 months and will continue to improve next year.</p>
<p>&quot;An increase in foreign direct investment is the highlight: for instance, the country received a record $7.7 billion in FDI during the first 11 months of 1996, a 20 percent increase from the year-earlier period, which financed two-fifths of Brazil's current account deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;This FDI flow is sure to grow further in 1997 to at least $10 billion in the wake of privatizations and the opening up of strategic sectors to private investment,&quot; the report said.</p>
