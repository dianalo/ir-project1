<title>SOUTH AFRICA: Macmed to raise cash, may list Zimbabwe arm.</title>
<headline>Macmed to raise cash, may list Zimbabwe arm.</headline>

<p>South African medical firm Macmed Heath  Care Ltd said on Friday it plans to raise 40 million in cash and that  its Zimbabwe arm was considering certain acquisitions which may lead  to a listing on that country's stock exchange.</p>
<p>The announcement follows news this week of Macmed's purchase of a  distributor of medical products, The Scientific Group, from South  Africa's Jasco Electronics Ltd.</p>
<p>Macmed said the purchase price for the group was 88.6 million rand  which would be settled by the issue of 22.15 million new Macmed shares  at 400 cents each to be placed, on behalf of Jasco, with various financial  instituions.</p>
<p>The cash raising exercise would see Macmed issuing 10 million new  shares of five cents each to financial institutions for 400 cents  each.</p>
<p>The firm said that the Scientific Group exported products to various  African countries, especially Zimbabwe. Exports contributed between  15 and 20 percent to the group's turnover.</p>
<p>It said that Macmed Zimbabwe, in which Macmed owns a 64.25 percent  stake, was mulling certain buys which would double the size of the  business and afford the firm the opportunity to list on the Zimbabwe  Stock Exchange in the near future.</p>
<p>Macmed said that all acquisitions since April 1, 1997, coupled with  the new cash issue, had increased shareholder funds to around 220  million rand after goodwill and tradmarks were written off.</p>
<p>This would leave Mamed debt free and with sufficient cash to fund  working capital arising from an increase in turnover which would soon  exceed 40 million rand a month.</p>
