<p>Turnover climbed sharply on a firmer Saudi Arabian stock market last week in a session shortened by SAMA's implementation of new trading software, the Riyadh-based Bakheet Financial Advisors (BFA) said.</p>
<p>The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency cancelled trade on Thursday to implement a new software version of the trading system ESIS.</p>
<p>The value of trade rose more than 66 percent in the week to around 599 million riyals ($160 million) and the number of shares dealt climbed 55 percent to 2.7 million, BFA said.</p>
<p>&quot;These increased volumes signal a healthy uptrend for the market,&quot; BFA said in a commentary on Sunday.</p>
<p>Of the 70 shares listed on the market, 58 were dealt in the week. Most stocks moved higher, with 38 climbing, eight falling and 12 unchanged.</p>
<p>The all-share index rose 1.64 percent to a 160.92 point close on Wednesday, from 158.32 the previous Thursday.</p>
<p>BFA said blue-chip shares with market capitalisation above one billion riyals were the main winners in the week.</p>
<p>&quot;The only exception was Mecca Real Estate and Development which was down by a small 0.8 percent,&quot; BFA said.</p>
<p>It closed at 249 riyals from 251. The previous week it had lost 10 riyals from 261 riyals.</p>
<p>Zoujaj was the biggest gainer, adding 12 riyals, or 7.8 percent, to 165.</p>
<p>Taibah was another large climber, adding 6.4 percent to 50 riyals &quot;due to a management announcement that the company did not intend to call in any unpaid capital&quot;, BFA said.</p>
<p>Banking stocks were the most active in the week, accounting for 244 million riyals, or 41 percent, of total turnover.</p>
<p>Al-Rajhi Banking and Investment Corp witnessed heavy trading in the week, BFA said, with 88 million riyals worth of shares changing hands. It closed 1.4 percent up at 1,168.</p>
<p>Services sector stocks followed banks, with 24 percent of volume. More than 100 million riyals worth of Mecca Real Estate and Development stock were traded, representing about 70 percent of trade in services sector shares in the week, BFA said.</p>
<p>&quot;The company has just completed its seventh round of residential unit selling in the holy city of Mecca,&quot; BFA said.</p>
