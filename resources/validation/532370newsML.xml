<title>USA: CME pork bellies end sharply higher but off highs.</title>
<headline>CME pork bellies end sharply higher but off highs.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>CME pork belly futures closed sharply higher but down from new contract highs in frozen contracts late as profit taking pared best levels at the close, traders said.</p>
<p>Bellies closed 2.600 cent per lb higher to 0.200 lower with July up most at 91.675 cents. All contracts traded except the November fresh contract set a new high with May surging to a new high of 92.825 cents before closing 2.300 cent higher at 92.125 cents. July posted a new high of 92.075 cents before closing up 2.600 cent at 91.675 cents.</p>
<p>Hog slaughter cutbacks this week and lighter stored stocks added to recent pork belly strength linked to export demand, and lifted pork bellies to new highs, traders said.</p>
<p>Pork bellies rose from the start on Tuesday's CME weekly out-of-town report, which showed 409,000 lbs of bellies were moved out of CME-approved warehouses outside Chicago. Analysts and traders had expected a small net in-movement.</p>
<p>&quot;If we're not storing now, there's not going to be anything (stocks) for the summer&quot; when demand for bacon peaks, said Julia Bussie, analyst for AG Edwards.</p>
<p>Bussie also cited a strong technical market and expected further tightening of stocks due to slaughter cutbacks. Export demand should also stay active, she said. But there is concern that high prices are killing domestic demand, she added.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're pricing out domestic demand,&quot; Bussie added.</p>
<p>Cash bellies traded at $85 per cwt for 14-16 lbs again Wednesday, the highest price level since August 27.</p>
<p>Speculator and commercial short covering and fund buying sparked the upward impetus while some commercials sold on the scale up. E.D.&amp;F. Man notably bought May and July while Spike Trading and Smith Barney bought August on the rally. Locals and Rand Financials sold May into the close and LFG sold July and ABN Chicogo Corp sold August to clip gains, traders said.</p>
<p>Hog futures ended mixed after setting new highs.</p>
<p>Spillover demand from the rally in pork bellies boosted August and October hog contracts to new contract highs before prices slipped late on this week's slow packer demand for hogs, traders said.</p>
<p>Hog futures closed 0.450 cent per lb higher to 0.300 lower with June off 0.050 at 84.950 cents. August set a new high of 83.200 and October 75.950 cents.</p>
<p>Light hog runs are being offset by the reduced packer buying. Packer margins remain deep in the red and they will continue to reduce kills and try to buy hogs as inexpensively as possible.</p>
<p>USDA estimated U.S. hog slaughter through Wednesday at 946,000 head, well under 1,038,000 in the same period last week and 1,055,000 last year.</p>
<p>There is also growing concern that recent gains in cash pork prices have cut domestic demand, traders said.</p>
<p>Commission houses bought June and sold July late while Rand Financials sold June. RBH sold August, pit sources said.</p>
