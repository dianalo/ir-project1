<p>Poland's economy should grow between 5.5 to six percent annually until 2000, but this would not be enough to catch up with poorer European Union countries in 15 years, planning ministry officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Various estimates already see Poland's gross domestic product (GDP) growing by about 5.5 percent this year and next year after a seven-percent rise in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;If current policy is realised there's a chance we can maintain the quick pace of five-to-six percent to the end of the 90s,&quot; Jozef Zajchowski, a senior CUP analyst, told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said that even six-percent annual growth would leave Poland behind the poorer EU countries such as Portugal, Spain and Greece at the end of the next decade and Poland would need growth of 9-14 percent annually to achieve similar levels.</p>
<p>Zajchowski and Tadeusz Chroscicki, head analyst at CUP, said a positive signal was a 9.5-percent increase in industrial output over the first ten months this year, with October production up 13.9 percent.</p>
<p>Zajchowski said construction output growth had also gained pace, increasing by 15.8 percent in the third quarter but only 5.7 percent on the year, largely because of harsh weather in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Chroscicki said fourth-quarter construction could increase by 20 percent.</p>
<p>He also said this year's nine-month 26.5-percent growth in investment by firms employing more than 50 was a good sign, especially the 36-percent growth in machinery investment. @</p>
<p>But Chroscicki said a negative signal was the balance-of- payments deficit, which should reach $8 billion this year and $11 billion next year.</p>
<p>Chroscicki said the finance ministry's forecast of 13-percent year-on-year inflation at the end of next year was realistic as an expected slow-down in farm food-price growth should help reduce inflation from this year's levels.</p>
<p>The finance ministry sees inflation at about 18 percent at the end of this year.</p>
