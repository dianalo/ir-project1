<p>President Bill Clinton called together his political advisers on Friday to map strategy for the last lap of the presidential race, and a spokesman said Clinton was optimistic but not overconfident.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in a point now, having gone through the cycle of three debates, having worked through our schedule and the allocation of our resources, where we will make some final decisions about how to spend the final two weeks of the campaign,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.</p>
<p>McCurry said Clinton would huddle with his advisers and pollsters on Friday evening &quot;and then the campaign will be mapping out a game plan for the close-out of the campaign.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton, who continues to lead Republican Bob Dole in the pre-election polls by anywhere from nine to 14 percentage points, is &quot;obviously very encouraged ... but by no means do we take anything for granted,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The Democratic president was to return to the campaign trail on Sunday with a four-day trip to the battleground states of New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Michigan and Florida.</p>
<p>Signaling an increased emphasis on energizing support for Democratic congressional candidates, McCurry said Clinton would work hard &quot;both to further his own interests ... but also to help those in the Democratic Party who share his values.&quot;</p>
<p>With just two and one-half weeks left before the Nov 5. election, Dole is trying to persuade voters that Clinton is unfit for leadership with relentless attacks on his ethics.</p>
<p>The Clinton campaign struck back on Friday by circulating newly released documents on Dole's defense of then-President Richard Nixon in the 1970s Watergate scandal even though the White House said it was unconcerned about Dole's attacks.</p>
<p>Clinton is &quot;not going to spend a lot of time responding to Senator Dole, because Senator Dole is increasingly, day by day, excessively shrill and sort of outside the mainstream of this debate,&quot; McCurry said.</p>
<p>However, at a picture-taking session with visiting Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri of Lebanon, Clinton did respond to Republican accusations that the Democratic Party may have taken money from foreign sources.</p>
<p>He said he had asked the Democratic National Committee to review its contributions and make sure they were appropriate.</p>
<p>McCurry contemptuously dismissed Dole's challenge to Clinton to engage in another debate, calling it &quot;theater of the absurd.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We had three debates negotiated between the two campaigns and we agreed that was going to be it,&quot; the White House official said, referring to the two presidential debates and the one vice presidential encounter.</p>
<p>He added that the Clinton and Dole campaigns &quot;specifically agreed that people wouldn't come along with some stunt like calling for additional debates.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And they know that,&quot; McCurry said. &quot;But they're left now to resorting to that type of -- that type of theater.</p>
