<p>Mexican stocks closed slightly lower Friday, after the bulk of the day's losses were erased by a recovery in U.S. blue-chips and late buying ahead of the close of the month.</p>
<p>&quot;The market tended to recover towards the close, due to (portfolio) valuations that need to be made at the close of the month and the quarter,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;Also, the Dow turned around and that obviously helped.&quot;</p>
<p>The blue chip IPC index fell 2.74 points to 3,236.79, compared to a session low of 3,203.17. Volume was sluggish at 60.3 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;With the low volume we had it could easily have fallen through, but the rebound was at low volume and there are no indications of a change in downtrend,&quot; said a technical analyst.</p>
<p>Lagging stocks and selective speculative buying stood out in a session otherwise marked by low volume. The percentage gainers list was led by video rentals stock Video nominal series shares, which gained 2.10 pesos (28 cents) to 14.89 pesos ($1.97), and are not frequently traded.</p>
<p>In second place was financial group Abaco B series, which gained 26 centavos (3 cents) to 2.74 pesos (36 cents), which traders put down to speculation that its banking division would raise capital.</p>
<p>Other gainers were traded at very low volume.</p>
<p>On the broad market, of a total of 107 stocks traded, gainers outnumbered losers 44 to 43, with the remaining 20 unchnaged.</p>
