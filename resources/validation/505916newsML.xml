<p>The Kremlin, under pressure from nationalist critics, sounded a tough note on Monday ahead of new talks with NATO and announced plans to help home-grown industry with a nationwide appeal to &quot;Buy Russian&quot;.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's spokesman told Itar-Tass news agency that the president, who has ordered officials to change their foreign cars for less glamourous Russian models, would focus on his new campaign in a radio address on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;He plans to develop his call to Russians to show a preference for home-made products,&quot; Tass said, quoting presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky.</p>
<p>&quot;Buy Russian goods, they are our goods,&quot; Yeltsin said last week, announcing his campaign, but made clear it would not mean restrictions on imports.</p>
<p>Some reports say up to half of the food consumed by Russians is imported. Russians prefer in many cases to buy Western products, particularly electronic goods, because equivalent Russian made items do not meet world standards.</p>
<p>The 66-year-old Kremlin leader is trying to counter public discontent about the state of affairs in Russia and nationalist criticism that he has sold out to the West.</p>
<p>On Monday Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky sounded a jarring note on the eve of a visit by NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, saying NATO was showing little flexibility in talks to forge a partnership between the former Cold War foes.</p>
<p>Some NATO members &quot;are not showing enough desire to seek a compromise,&quot; said Yastrzhembsky, reflecting pessimism among some Russian officials about a deal with NATO, which plans to expand eastwards despite fierce Russian opposition.</p>
<p>Yeltsin reshuffled his cabinet last month to reinforce it with young reformers and launched a crusade against corruption.</p>
<p>In recent weeks he has criticised one official after another, partly to show he is back at the helm after months of illness and that he is tackling Russia's problems.</p>
<p>But he also offered some praise.</p>
<p>He told Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin the government had worked better since the reshuffle, Tass said.</p>
<p>Some of Chernomyrdin's responsibilities for overseeing the economy have gone to two young first deputies -- Boris Nemtsov, 37, and Anatoly Chubais, 41.</p>
<p>Chubais and Nemtsov have vowed to take radical measures to end chronic non-payments in industry and delays in wages and pensions which are strangling the economy.</p>
<p>Vitaly Artyukhov, head of the Russian State Tax Service, resigned last week complaining of uncertainty surrounding his position as a result of the sweeping cabinet changes.</p>
<p>Yeltsin dismissed him on Monday. He also named Nikolai Aksenenko to replace Anatoly Zaitsev as Railways Minister and fired deputy foreign minister Ivan Kuznetsov, replacing him with Ivan Sergeyev, who had overseen services for foreign diplomats.</p>
<p>But he commended the recent work of Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, an opponent of NATO expansion and an advocate of closer ties with neighbouring Belarus whose president, Alexander Lukashenko, the West has criticised as authoritarian.</p>
<p>He praised Primakov's mediation at talks between the former Soviet republic of Moldova and its breakaway Dnestr region which brought moves last week towards a normalisation of their ties.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's praise represented a vote of support for Primakov, who had been accused by Russian media of pushing too hard for a union deal with Belarus.</p>
