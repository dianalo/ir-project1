<p>U.S. spot natgas prices were up only marginally in most markets Monday, despite the significantly below-normal temperatures in the eastern half of the U.S., industry sources said.</p>
<p>Sources attributed the lack of rally to forecasts for warmer air seen returning next week.</p>
<p>Gulf Coast gas traded in the high-$2.60s to mid-$2.70s, unchanged to about two cents higher from Friday's levels.</p>
<p>At the New York city-gate, however, prices soared into the high-$3.20s to low-$3.40s as temperatures are expected to be at least 10 degrees below-normal in the Northeast this week.  </p>
<p>In the Midcontinent, where temperatures are expected to be about 10 to 20 degrees below-normal this week, prices gained two to four cents to the low-$2.60s.</p>
<p>The Chicago city-gate market was steady to slightly stronger in the high-$2.80s to mid-$2.90s.</p>
<p>In west Texas, Permian prices climbed about three cents to the low-to-mid $2.50s, while at Waha gas traded in the mid-$2.50s to low-$2.60s.</p>
<p>At the southern California border, traders reported closing deals in the mid-$2.60s as temperatures hovered just above-normal.</p>
<p>To avoid moving the spot market much higher, buyers may be turning to storage supplies to meet the strong heating demand in the Northeast and Midwest, traders said.</p>
