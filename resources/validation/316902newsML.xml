<p>A government analysis has challenged some findings of a recent private-sector report on the U.S. Consumer Price Index, the head of a joint House-Senate economic committee said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) identified several weaknesses in the so-called Boskin report, including the suggestion that the bureau inaccurately measured quality changes in CPI basket goods, Rep. Jim Saxton said.</p>
<p>Saxton, a Republican from New Jersey, requested the BLS analysis in his capacity as head of the House-Senate Joint Economic Committee.  </p>
<p>The report, written by a panel headed by Stanford University Economist Michael Boskin, said the BLS overestimated U.S. consumer inflation by about 1 percentage point annually.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the next 12 years, the Boskin Commission recommendations would amount to a trillion dollars in tax increases and benefit restraint,&quot; Saxton said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The immense impact of these changes affect too many people to permit hasty decisions on the basis of incomplete information,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The BLS analysis said the Boskin report failed to take account of adjustments that are currently made to account for quality changes in CPI basket goods.</p>
<p>The analysis also said the formula for CPI revision suggested by the commission assumed a degree of substitution among goods and services that is not always appropriate.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, it is clearly wrong to assume that the CPI does nothing to take increased durability adjustments to auto prices made in the CPI since 1992,&quot; the analysis said.</p>
