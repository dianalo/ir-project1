<title>JORDAN: British supercar trundles across Jordanian desert.</title>

<p>Britain's jet-powered car Thrust SSC gingerly rolled out on its first test run in the Jordanian desert on Monday since flash floods washed away its hopes of breaking the world land speed record last year.</p>
<p>Current world record holder Richard Noble said the car, powered by twin jet engines from a Phantom warplane, trundled across the mudflats of Al-Jafr at around 100 mph (160 kph).</p>
<p>Noble's Thrust Supersonic Team are using their trials in Jordan to prepare for an assault later in the year in the United States on his own world speed record of 633.47 miles per hour (1,019.44 kph).</p>
<p>They also hope to go one stage further and exceed the speed of sound (about 750 mph/1,200 kph).</p>
<p>Last year, after announcing they would break the speed record on a daily basis in Jordan, they failed to match even half that speed. The 9.5 tonne car suffered suspension problems and rear steering of its solid aluminium wheels caused trouble.</p>
<p>Noble finally gave in when the heaviest rains in five years turned their track, mapped out on the parched desert where scenes from &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; were filmed, into a lake.</p>
<p>He said the team hoped to turn up the power on Tuesday to nudge the car up to 300 mph (480 kph).</p>
<p>&quot;Once we pass that point we'll have a higher level of confidence in the steering and the rear suspension,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Thrust team say they will not attempt to break the world record in al-Jafr, an arid basin about 125 miles (200 km) south of Amman, because it is not wide enough.</p>
<p>To notch up a world record the car's speed must be measured over the same one mile (1.6 km) strip on two separate runs, in opposite directions. The car, with powerful brakes and a parachute, needs about seven miles to slow down.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll try to set a one-way mark. It won't be considered a record,&quot; Noble's younger brother Andrew told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Thrust car, driven by British Royal Air Force pilot Andy Green, is racing to beat the speed of sound before U.S. driver Craig Breedlove.</p>
<p>Breedlove had to postpone his own challenge last year when his car, the Spirit of America, was damaged in a high speed accident in the Black Rock desert of Nevada.</p>
