<p>CSCE world sugar futures settled barely higher as trade scale-down buying and light local short-covering blunted earlier losses and lifted the market over unchanged near the close, dealers said.</p>
<p>May ended 0.01 cent higher at 10.96 cents per lb, having ranged from 10.98 to 10.86. Most-active July gained 0.03 cent on the day to close at 10.88, while the remaining months finished 0.01 lower to up 0.02.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 23,086 lots compared with Wednesday's official 45,708 lots.</p>
<p>Persistent speculative selling in the May/July spread kept the market under pressure during the first half of the day, when the spread traded from 0.11 to 0.07 before closing at 0.08.</p>
<p>Traders said the spread should remain supported from 0.10.</p>
<p>The locals, expecting the market to break down under Wednesday's low of 10.87 basis May, covered short positions when they failed to locate sell stops at the day's low of 10.86 cents, dealers said.</p>
<p>The trade, meantime, remained an excellent buyer on a scale-down basis.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like a consolidation from the selloff yesterday,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;We tested the lower levels early but there is no incentive to pressure the market down further.&quot;</p>
<p>Open interest remains high in May at 43,728 lots, down 11,894 lots as of Tuesday's close. The market could remain under pressure until the end of the month as speculators roll out May contracts, dealers said.</p>
<p>The last trading day for the spot month is April 30.</p>
