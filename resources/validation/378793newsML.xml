<p>Public Service Co of New Mexico said on Friday that the New Mexico Public Utility Commission ordered the company to cut its natural gas rates by nearly $7 million.</p>
<p>The commission had also ordered on February 13 that both its Public Service Co of New Mexico Electric Services and Public Service Co of New Mexico Gas Services units file new rate cases based on 1996 revenues and expenses.</p>
<p>The electric rate case is to be filed by May 1, 1997, and the gas rate case is to be filed by August 1, 1997.  </p>
<p>The commission also reviewed the purchasing and billing policies for Public Service Co's customers in January.</p>
<p>After finding that the company understated the cost of gas factor for December, the commission disallowed $1.6 million of gas costs in December.</p>
<p>A penalty in the case was imposed but then suspended.</p>
<p>The commission ordered an independent audit of all 1996 cost of gas filings, and scheduled a new investigation.  </p>
<p>The commission disallowed the recovery of certain deferred regulatory assets, amortization of losses on reacquired debt, and a portion of the costs the company incurred in preparing and filing the rate case.</p>
<p>It ordered a 30-year weather normalization adjustment which accounts for $3.7 million of the rate decrease.</p>
<p>Originally, Public Services of New Mexico Gas Services had requested a $13.3 million increase in rates for its customers. The commission refused to consider the agreement.</p>
