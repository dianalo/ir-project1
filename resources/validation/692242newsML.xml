<p>With its bid of 3.15 billion pesos (about $393.75 million), the sole consortium vying for Mexico's mammoth Pacific-North railroad appears to have won the concession at a bargain price.</p>
<p>The bidders in the consortium, miner Grupo Mexico with a 74 percent stake, builder Empresas ICA and U.S. Union Pacific, each holding 13 percent, came back from losing the coveted Northeast railroad in December to offer the only bid for the competing Pacific-North railway, at less than a third the price.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they got a great bargain,&quot; Credit Lyonnais analyst David Bodenberg said.</p>
<p>The bid by Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano (GFM), as the consortium is known, topped the government's minimum requirement of $341 million.</p>
<p>A final decision on whether the group will win the concession for 80 percent of the railway's assets is subject to government approval.</p>
<p>But analysts are already hailing the virtual win as a boon for GFM, especially in contrast with the recently privatized competing Northeast Railway.</p>
<p>In December, Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM) and Kansas City Southern Industries 's TFM consortia won the Northeast concession for a whopping $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>The two railways run north and south through Mexico, and touch many of the same key industrial cities, such as Mexico City and Monterrey.</p>
<p>The Northeast was considered the jewel of Mexico's railway system, at half the Pacific-North's 6,521 kilometers (4,075 miles) and superior rail condition.</p>
<p>But now analysts are now noting the competitive advantage of the lower GFM bid price.</p>
<p>&quot;At twice as long and a third the price, I think you've got yourself a good deal,&quot; said an analyst who declined to be named. &quot;This is bad news for TFM.&quot;</p>
<p>Grupo Mexico Planning Director Javier Garcia told reporters that the companies in the consortium had the cash to pay for the concession, and would not have to look for outside financing.</p>
<p>GFM said it also planned to opt to buy the remaining 20 percent stake in the Pacific-North in addition to the Topolobampo-Ojinaga route, key transport to Grupo Mexico's copper interests.</p>
<p>The total price tag it proposed was $527.39 million, as well as a commitment to invest 5 billion pesos (around $630 million) in the line over the next ten years.</p>
<p>In contrast, TFM had to raise $593.5 million in debt offers and to invite the government to take a stake in the Northeast Railway.</p>
<p>Analysts also cited the advantage of Union Pacific's participation in the GFM venture.</p>
<p>&quot;If Union Pacific wanted to diversify traffic from the Northeast line to the Pacific-North, it most likely would be able to do so given its market clout above the border,&quot; said James Valentine of Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>For the Pacific-North, the key U.S. border cites are at Nogales and at Piedras Negras-Eagle Pass, whereas the Northeast connects to U.S. railways at Nuevo Laredo-Laredo and Matamoros-Brownsville.</p>
<p>&quot;Given that the U.S. is expanding westward, the Pacific-North could be the railroad of the future,&quot; Bodenberg said.</p>
<p>In 1995, the Pacific-North carried about 8.86 million tonnes of cargo, while the Northeast shipped 6.25 million tonnes of imports.</p>
