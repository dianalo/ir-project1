<title>MEXICO: Mexican judge confirms Colosio suspect not guilty.</title>
<headline>Mexican judge confirms Colosio suspect not guilty.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1996-11-07</dateline>

<p>A Mexican appeals court on Thursday affirmed a not guilty verdict for a suspect in the 1994 assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio.</p>
<p>Appeals Judge Gerardo Jaime Escobar said he agreed with the original August 7 ruling by Judge Jorge Pardo Rebolledo, which freed alleged gunman Othon Cortes Vazquez for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>Cortes was arrested in February 1995 on charges he shot Colosio, the heavily favoured presidential candidate of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He was shot in the abdomen at the end of a campaign rally in the northern city of Tijuana.</p>
<p>Cortes's arrest was a key component in prosecutors' efforts to prove the killing was a plot but his release 18 months later seriously undermined their conspiracy case.</p>
<p>He cannot be tried again on the same charges.</p>
<p>Another man, Mario Aburto Martinez, is serving a 45-year prison sentence after being convicted of shooting Colosio in the head at the March 23, 1994, rally. Aburto is the only man in prison for the assassination.</p>
<p>Attorney General Antonio Lozano said on Thursday he thought the latest ruling was &quot;unfounded and unjustified&quot; and pledged the investigation would continue.</p>
<p>Investigators still believe the killing of Colosio, who would almost certainly have become Mexican president, was a plot.</p>
<p>Colosio's place as PRI candidate was taken by his campaign manager Ernesto Zedillo, who went on to win the August 1994 presidential election.</p>
<p>The August release of Cortes led to the dismissal of Pablo Chapa Bezanilla, the third special prosecutor to investigate the case. His replacement, Luis Raul Gonzalez Perez, has said he will reopen the investigation.</p>
