<p>Easynet Group Plc, a fast-growing internet service provider in Britain and France, expects to continue to grow quickly during 1997 and aims to be cash generative by the year-end, its chairman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>David Rowe, who is also chief executive, told Reuters in a telephone interview after the release of its 1996 results that Easynet's development was closely tied to organic growth in its base of corporate clients who contribute most of its revenue.</p>
<p>&quot;On the corporate side we are looking for sales orientated growth in 1997 because not many people are able to provide the service as well as the access as we do,&quot; Rowe said.</p>
<p>In 1996, Easynet's turnover increased by 239 percent to 2.16 million stg as its customer base expanded more than fourfold in both consumer and corporate categories.</p>
<p>Its losses deepened, however, increasing to 884,000 stg at the pretax level from a 130,000 loss in the 17-month period to December 31, 1995.</p>
<p>Rowe said that as well as aiming to generate cash by the end of 1997 the company aimed to be in the black in 1998.</p>
<p>The main competition in connecting business clients comes from WorldCom Inc's UUNET Pipex and British Telecommunications Plc, Rowe added.</p>
<p>He said that Easynet's advantage was that both these rival firms were essentially telecoms companies, while Easynet could only be characterised as an information technology specialist. Looking to the future, he said Easynet would keep eyeing its options to start up a compact, business-oriented German network to complement its existing British and French activities.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been looking at Germany for about nine months. It is one that is possibly on the cards, but we don't want to stretch ourselves too much,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Looking at the earning potential of its various areas, Rowe said he saw the provision of internet access becoming more and more of a commodity business with less attractive margins.</p>
<p>&quot;So each year we will move more and more into the value added stuff,&quot; he said. These areas include network management, website services and providing bespoke network connections.</p>
<p>&quot;The key challenge in 1997 is to manage growth by recruiting the right people and getting the right financial information to allow us to remain repsonsive,&quot; Rowe added.</p>
