<headline>NZ consumer confidence static in December - survey.</headline>

<p>New Zealand consumer confidence remained unchanged in the December 1996 quarter but spending intentions were down, according to the WestpacTrust McDermott Miller Survey of consumer confidence published on Wednesday.</p>
<p>WestpacTrust said the consumer confidence index stood at 121.2 in December 1996, compared with 121.2 in September 1996 and 122.1 in December 1995.  </p>
<p>Graham said the implication was that although consumers remain positive regarding the future outlook, demand pressures were relatively weak in December 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Retail sales data for Deecember should confirm a comparatively weak December quarter. However, this could foreshadow a similar pattern to that seen across the holiday season last year; a poor Christmas for retailers until post Christmas 'sales' started.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Despite the fact that overall consumer confidence remained constant in December, some components of consumer confidence recorded very significant changes,&quot; WestpacTrust chief economist Bevan Graham said.</p>
<p>&quot;The most striking shift in sentiment occurred in consumers' attitude towards purchasing a major household item. Net positive responses to this question plunged to the lowest level since December 1990. This effect was most pronounced in metropolitan centres, most notably in Auckland.&quot;  </p>
<p>Graham said depite the relatively high levels of confidence overall, &quot;we do not expect this to translate into another prolonged surge in property market activity following recent falls in variable mortgage interest rates&quot;.</p>
<p>It appeared anecdotal evidence of weak December quarter data would be confirmed and the weak response in the survey to purchases of large ticket items did not bode well for retail sales over the March quarter.  </p>
<p>From a regional perspective, the already significant disparity between consumer confidence levels in metropolitan centres and rural areas increased over the December 1996 quarter. The index rose 2.6 points to 130.1 for metropolitan centres but fell 0.2 to 112.4 in rural areas.</p>
<p>Similarly, the difference between the North and South Islands increased over the quarter; up 2.1 points to 123.7 in the North Island and down 5.6 points to 115.0 in the South Island.  </p>
<p>&quot;From the Reserve Bank's perspective this result certainly does not preclude a further easing in monetary policy, but highlights the undesirable mix of current conditions,&quot; Graham said.</p>
<p>Richard Miller of McDermott Miller said consumers in most rural regions showed signs of faltering confidence. &quot;They appear hesitant while they work out what the new form of government means for them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the growing consumer expectation of improved personal finances and better economic times over the year ahead is a hopeful sign that consumer sentiment will remain optimistic.&quot;</p>
