<p>China's local currency interbank market has admitted seven foreign banks as second-tier members, the Shanghai Securities News said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Only those foreign banks which have approval to do Chinese yuan business can be admitted to the interbank market, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The move allows the foreign banks to borrow and lend short-term money through the short-term financial centres, money brokerages run by the People's Bank, the central bank, who are full first-tier members, according to exchange rules.</p>
<p>The market now has 20 major state banks' head offices and 35 short-term financial centres as its first-tier members. Hundreds of other banks, major state bank branches and brokerages are second-tier members trading through the centres.</p>
<p>The central bank has set limits for the amount of yuan business foreign banks can do on the interbank market as it does with Chinese financial institutions, industry sources said.</p>
<p>The limits differ from one bank to another and from time to time, the sources said but declined to give further details.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi had become the first bank to put a deposit on the Chinese yuan market, but gave no details.  </p>
<p>A bank official told Reuters on Monday that the bank had put 10 million yuan on 18-day deposit at an annual rate of 10.98 percent. He said the bank had used its own capital for the deposit.</p>
<p>Formerly, foreign banks had only been allowed to make small transactions for a maximum of 48 hours through the yuan interbank market to cover settlement of accounts by foreign-funded firms.</p>
<p>China's central bank, the People's Bank, has approved eight foreign banks to do yuan business and it was not immediately clear which of the banks had not been admitted into the interbank market.</p>
<p>The Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp and the Industrial Bank of Japan announced the start of yuan business last week, but only referred to loan pre-agreements.</p>
