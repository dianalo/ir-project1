<title>DUBAI: UAE Al-Khazna Insurance offering oversubscribed.</title>
<headline>UAE Al-Khazna Insurance offering oversubscribed.</headline>
<dateline>DUBAI 1996-09-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>United Arab Emirates investors subscribed to more than seven times the 2.09 million shares on offer in the newly formed Al-Khazna Insurance Co (AKIC), brokers and bankers said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Subscription managers Union National Bank said it received orders worth nearly 1.5 billion dirhams against the 209 million dirhams worth of shares on offer, which represent 55 percent of the company's authorised capital.</p>
<p>AKIC, with authorised capital of 380 million dirhams, will be the largest of 10 UAE insurance firms in terms of capital.</p>
<p>It said in August it was offering 2.09 million shares with a nominal value of 100 dirhams each to UAE nationals. The offering closed on Saturday.</p>
<p>It said minimum subscription would be 200 shares and maximum subscription should not exceed five percent of the authorised capital, but brokers said AKIC may have to drop the minimum subscription requirement.</p>
<p>&quot;Share appropriation will reduce the minimum subscription level to less than the 200 shares. Minimum subscription could be dropped to 100 shares,&quot; Zuhair Kaswani, financial analysts at al-Sharhan Stocks and Bonds told Reuters.</p>
<p>Analysts attributed the large capital to AKIC plans to expand its operations to other Gulf states and to establish itself as the first re-insurance company in the region.</p>
<p>AKIC's public offering is the third flotation on the UAE unofficial stock exchange since March 1995. Public offerings by Dubai Investment Co and Abu Dhabi Shipbuilding Co were three times oversubscribed.</p>
