<headline>France urges Zaire ceasefire, relief access.</headline>

<text>
<p>France called on Wednesday for an immediate ceasefire in Zaire and said it was trying to get its allies to persuade advancing rebels to let relief teams get through to tens of thousands of refugees fleeing the fighting.</p>
<p>A Foreign Ministry spokesman said relief groups had been repeateadly denied access to the refugees whose situation, especially that of children, was worsening by the day.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a tragedy. We must act fast,&quot; spokesman Yves Doutriaux told a news briefing.</p>
<p>He said Paris was trying to mobilise all its partners and to put pressure on the rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;We are approaching countries that can have an influence on the (rebel) Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL) so that a solution can be found and the populations in need rescued before it is too late,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;A ceasefire, which has been agreed in principle by Zairean delegations at the OAU summit, must take effect immediately,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Talks between representatives of Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko and the rebel movement of Laurent Kabila will probably be held in South Africa on Saturday, with key U.N. negotiator Mohamed Sahnoun attending.</p>
<p>A ceasefire date and the agenda remain to be worked out by the two sides. Kabila's rebels have been fighting Mobutu's</p>
