<headline>Frankfurt bourse seen boosted by dollar, Dow gains.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-19</dateline>

<p>The Frankfurt bourse was expected to perk up somewhat ahead of the weekend -- boosted by a firmer dollar and strength on Wall Street -- after a rather lacklustre day of trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX, reflecting all-day computerised dealings in the DAX index of 30 top German shares, jumped off earlier lows in the afternoon to trade up 15.80 points, or 0.56 percent, at 2,830.03 points by 1520 GMT.</p>
<p>The market was encouraged as Bunds, the dollar and Wall Street rose after a larger-than-expected drop in the U.S. trade deficit in October to $7.99 billion.  </p>
<p>Dealers said hopes for an out of court settlement in VW's legal battle with General Motors Corp. had crept back into the market, despite GM saying on Wednesday no talks with VW were planned.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar, Bund and Wall Street all contribute to the favourable outlook,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Dealers said the DAX index, which ended bourse dealings at 2,807.75 points, had the potential to climb to 2,850 on Friday.</p>
<p>Dealers said that ahead of the settlement of the December DAX future contract on Friday, most activity was centred in the futures market with dealings limited in the cash market.</p>
<p>They said the fact that Friday was a so-called triple-witching day, when the settlement of the DAX future is accompanied by the expiry of futures in individual DAX component stocks, could cause some volatility.  </p>
<p>The dollar's rise above 1.56 marks in the afternoon gave a boost to export-oriented stocks, in particular the chemical sector, which had been dragging its heels earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, shares in Henkel KGaA, powered ahead, gaining three percent or 2.24 marks to 74.50 marks, after its said it planned to acuire the remaining 23 percent of consumer products group Hans Schwarzkopf that it does not already own.</p>
<p>Shares in Volkswagen were up seven marks at 626.50.</p>
