<p>Loss-making Finnish sporting goods group Amer-Yhtyma Oy's CEO Roger Talermo promised in the annual report on Friday that a new focus would give shareholders competitive returns on investment in the longer term.</p>
<p>&quot;For Amer's shareholders, the group's new focus ... will result in a better balanced risk together with competitive returns on their investment in the longer term,&quot; Talermo wrote in the report.</p>
<p>The turnaround would take time, he warned.</p>
<p>&quot;Our ship cannot be turned around in a day, it will take two, three years,&quot; Talermo said.  </p>
<p>&quot;As the problems are broadly based, the measures introduced will need several years to take full effect,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the future, Amer would operate in branded sports and leisure products. In the group's sports division, Wilson (golf, tennis, team sports), Atomic (skis) and Oxygen (snowboards, in-line skates) were brands given &quot;top priority&quot;, Talermo said.</p>
<p>&quot;In accordance with the new strategy, both Wilson and Atomic's organisations are committed to premium products which are innovative, enhance game improvement and are targeted to the average consumer,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Amer would offer wholesalers and retailers &quot;a comprehensive sports portfolio from winter and summer sports, indoor to outdoor games, from traditional to trend sports,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Amer's smaller units, Amer Tobacco and Time/system now had &quot;clear strategies&quot; for the short and medium term, Talermo said.</p>
<p>In 1996, Amer fell to a 234 million markka loss before extraordinary items and tax from a 140 million markka profit.</p>
<p>Return on investment was negative at 2.3 percent last year from a positive reading of 5.9 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>The annual report repeated that earnings would improve in 1997, but that overall, Amer &quot;may remain lossmaking.&quot; --Helsinki newsroom +358-9-680 50 245, e-mail news@reuters.fi</p>
