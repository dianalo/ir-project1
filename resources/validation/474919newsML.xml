<p>U.S. Vice-President Al Gore on Friday met 10 Chinese academics in Shanghai to discuss the state of Sino-U.S. relations and political issues in China, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>Gore's press secretary Ginny Teranzo said the vice-president &quot;met with Chinese academics to discuss the political situation in China&quot;, but declined to give any details of the talk or to identify the academics involved.</p>
<p>Gore had two days of tough talks with Chinese leaders in Beijing earlier in the week covering sensitive issues which continue to dog relations between the two Pacific powers, including human rights, trade and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Another official in Gore's party said the vice-president had breakfast with the academics at his hotel and discussed the overall state of U.S.-China relations. He said two of the academics present currently also hold Chinese government posts.</p>
<p>Gore later met the mayor of Shanghai, Xu Kuangdi at the city hall, and later walked across People's Square in the centre of the city to inspect the new Shanghai Museum.</p>
<p>He was due to leave Shanghai later en route to Seoul, the last leg of his Asian trip before returning to Washington on Saturday.</p>
