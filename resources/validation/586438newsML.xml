<p>The Central Bureau of Statistics issued the following economic indicator on Thursday:</p>
<p>ISRAEL CONSUMER PRICES   Apr 97    March 97  Apr 96</p>
<p>Month-on-month change    + 0.7     + 1.0     + 1.7</p>
<p>Year-on-year change	+ 9.4     +10.4	 N/A</p>
<p>Index (base 100=1993)    147.9     146.8     135.2</p>
<p>Note: To compare previous indices based on 1987=100.0, multiply indices from January 1994 by 2.421.</p>
<p>The April index came in well below analysts' forecasts of about 1.1 percent and marked a comparative slowing of inflation from February and March.</p>
<p>The bureau said the April CPI was lifted mainly by increases in prices for clothing, footwear, health services and education. Produce and housing prices, which analysts expected to be high, in fact helped moderate the index. Housing prices rose only 0.7 percent and produce prices fell 0.7 percent (corrects the direction of change of produce prices).  </p>
<p>The financial markets were cheered by the news, which raised hopes that the Bank of Israel would move later this month to cut interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The CPI was surprisingly low and the options (market today) reflects hopes for a substantial rise on Sunday,&quot; said Shaar Gazit of Betucha Securities and Investments.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the Bank of Israel may decide to lower its key lending rate, but it won't lower it by more than half a percentage point,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The central bank last cut its key rate at the end of February to 13.9 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The slowdown in the economy is beginning to effect prices. (Bank of Israel's Governor Jacob) Frenkel's policy is showing its fruits,&quot; said Ilan Doron of Solid Financial Markets.</p>
<p>He said it was premature for the central bank to lower interest rates this month but said a cut was now inevitable.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the stock market -- if we don't have any surprises from New York -- to open strongly on Sunday with big demand,&quot; Doron said.  </p>
<p>The bureau said annualised inflation in the first four months of the year was about 10 percent, which puts it at the upper end of the government's target of seven to 10 percent.</p>
<p>The wholesale price index rose one percent, higher than in previous months, the bureau said.</p>
