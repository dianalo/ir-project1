<p>The Tokyo financial markets shrugged off news of the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping on Thursday, with the key stock market barometer rallying to its strongest level since January 7.</p>
<p>The dollar meanwhile dropped to below 124 yen on profit-taking, but Deng's death has been already discounted overnight in New York, where traders' reaction to his death was much less than the market had previously expected.</p>
<p>Japanese stocks powered higher on Thursday morning, with the key market index rallying above the 19,000 level by midday for the first time since January 7.</p>
<p>The Nikkei average of 225 leading issues jumped 413.16 points or 2.22 percent to end the morning session at 19,012.28. Its March futures rose 350 points to 19,000.</p>
<p>&quot;The death of Deng Xiaoping is only seen by a few to be a big factor in the stock market as his deteriorating health has already been reported for some time,&quot; Takahisa Matsuura, general manager at Nomura Securities Co, said.</p>
<p>There are currently no Chinese firms listed on the Tokyo bourse. Hong Kong's Henderson Land Development Co  8990.T listed its shares in Tokyo earlier this month.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese government apparently does not want major changes as a result of Deng's death ahead of Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty and a Communist Party convention slated for later this year,&quot; said a Nikko Research Center analyst.</p>
<p>Deng, who died on Wednesday evening, had retired from government leadership in 1989.</p>
<p>Construction and real estate shares staged a sharp recovery on a Japanese newspaper report that the government may use public funds to buy land held by loan-collecting bodies.</p>
<p>The influential financial daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the Japanese government plans to use more public funds to buy collateralised land held by failed &quot;jusen&quot; mortgage companies and other troubled financial firms.</p>
<p>The move would be designed to activate the sluggish property market and help dispose of the firms' non-performing loans, it said.</p>
<p>A Finance Ministry official, however, told Reuters that Japan was not mulling the use of new public funds to buy collateralised land formally owned by troubled financial firms.</p>
<p>&quot;The (Nihon Keizai report) had an impact,&quot; said Ryoichi Ohta, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co Ltd. &quot;But the buying has not gone beyond short-covering so far, as the construction shares had been sold off very hard recently.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar stood at around 123.70 yen and 1.6900 marks at Tokyo noon against its New York close of around 124.55 yen and 1.6980.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar's reaction (to Deng's death) was surprisingly marginal in New York after all these years of rumours about Deng's health, which sometimes gave a strong boost to the dollar,&quot; said a U.S. bank trader.</p>
<p>Japanese government bonds (JGB) and bond futures were down sharply at midday on the reported possible land purchase by the government and the stock rally.</p>
<p>The key March JGB futures contract ended the morning at 125.70, sharply down from Wednesday's 126.40 close.</p>
