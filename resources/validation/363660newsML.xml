<p>Voters in India's northern state of Punjab cast ballots peacefully on Friday in elections that were expected to thrust a pro-Sikh party into power.</p>
<p>The state's chief electoral officer Brajendra Singh said except for minor skirmishes between supporters of the ruling Congress party and its arch-rival Akali Dal party, polling had been trouble-free.</p>
<p>Officials said the elections to the 117-seat Punjab state legislature were the first in two decades not overshadowed by Sikh separatist violence. Some 65 percent of eligible voters cast ballots, Singh said.</p>
<p>India poured in 100,000 paramilitary soldiers to oversee elections. Police tightened security and sealed the borders of Punjab state with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Punjab police chief Sube Singh said all vehicles entering the rich farming region were searched for weapons.</p>
<p>Most opinion polls have predicted a victory for former chief minister Prakash Singh Badal's pro-Sikh Akali Dal party.</p>
<p>Surjit Singh Barnala, the last Akali Dal member to serve as Punjab chief minister and a member of the federal parliament, said his party was pleased with the relatively high turnout and predicted it would win at least 85 of 117 assembly seats.</p>
<p>Even the ruling Congress party admitted it would lose its majority. The party won 87 seats in February 1992, mainly because of an Akali Dal boycott.</p>
<p>But Congress politicians were sanguine. &quot;No party is expected to get a majority,&quot; said Malkiat Singh Dakha, a minister in the outgoing government and Congress candidate from a Ludhiana constituency.</p>
<p>Voters hailed the return of peace to Punjab.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time I have dared to vote in an election,&quot; said Shailendra Kumar, a 30-year-old car mechanic, as he waited for his turn at a polling booth in Ludhiana.</p>
<p>Sikh separatist violence peaked after Indian troops were sent into the Golden Temple in Amritsar in 1984 to flush out militants holed up in the Sikhs' holiest shrine.</p>
<p>The showdown triggered a bloody spate of violence in the state. The then prime minister Indira Gandhi was killed by two Sikh bodyguards on October 31, 1984, in what was believed to be a revenge killing for the army assault.</p>
<p>State polls in 1992, which revived local democracy after more than a decade of separatist violence, were held in an environment of fear and overbearing security.</p>
<p>The counting of ballots in Punjab is expected to start on Sunday and results are likely to be announced on the same day, officials said.</p>
