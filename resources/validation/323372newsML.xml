<p>Vice-President Abdel-Halim Khaddam has voiced Syria's support for Sudan's unity and its rejection of any foreign interference in Sudan's internal affairs, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said Khaddam made the remarks during a meeting on Monday night in Damascus with Sudanese Vice-President al-Zubeir Mohammad who is touring Arab states to brief leaders on the military conflict in Sudan.</p>
<p>&quot;The Sudanese vice-president explained the external military intervention against Sudan which is aimed at harming Sudan's unity...&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Khaddam affirmed Syria's support for the unity and territorial integrity of Sudan against any foreign intervention because Sudan's security is part of the Arab national security,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>The Sudanese military government has called for mobilisation against what it says are attacks from troops of neighbours Eritrea and Ethiopia. Both states deny these charges.</p>
<p>Rebels said they launched the fighting to put pressure on the Sudanese government and bring about a popular uprising.</p>
<p>Diplomats said that Khaddam and Shara discussed the Sudan issue during talks with Egyptian leaders in Cairo on Friday. Syria maintains good ties with Sudan and Egypt.</p>
<p>The Sudanese opposition says it has seized several towns and garrisons in the Blue Nile area but the government only admits to the loss of Kurmuk and Qeissan near the Ethiopian border.</p>
<p>The rebels say their goal is to advance on Damazin, site of a hydroelectricity plant which supplies Khartoum with most its power.</p>
<p>The Sudanese vice-president, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ali Osman Mohammad Taha, arrived in Damascus on Monday from Saudi Arabia where he had similar talks with King Fahd. They already visited Egypt and Yemen.</p>
