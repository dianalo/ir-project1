<p>China's A and B share indicies ended up on Friday on improved sentiment, with domestic investors the main buyers on the markets, brokers said.</p>
<p>Shanghai's B index edged up 0.17 points or 0.25 percent to 67.157 points on volume of 17.64 million worth $7.88 million. Brokers said rises on the A share market prompted increased buying by domestic investors on the B share market. The A index rose 16.018 points or 1.5 percent to 1,087.423 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic investors dominated recent market movements because they believe that most B share prices are better value than A shares,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Another broker said he expected the index to move in a narrow range early next week as the market awaits the issue of annual reports. All listed companies are required to issue annual reports by April 30.</p>
<p>Tientsin Marine Shipping was the star on a technical rebound after sharp losses over the past few days, rising $0.024 or 5.42 percent to $0.466 on volume of 1.1 million shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai Haixin, the most active counter, followed, helped by talk of better 1996 results. It gained $0.022 or 4.7 percent to $0.490 on volume of 1.9 million shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai A shares reversed early losses on market expectations of an exchange announcement after the close, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Shanghai stock exchange issued a circular late in the afternoon ordering all brokerages to publicise each day's five most active stocks and the major traders starting next Monday.</p>
<p>A total of 628 million shares worth six billion yuan were traded. The SSE30 index rose 18.162 points or 0.65 percent to 2819.398 points.</p>
<p>Yanzhong Industry was the biggest gainer on speculative buying, surging 0.94 yuan or 10.04 percent to 10.3 yuan on volume of 9.5 million.</p>
<p>Shenzhen's B share index gained 1.4 points or 0.92 percent to 153.15 points on turnover of HK$87 million, supported by official reports that Shenzhen securities authorities and officials from major listed firms are stepping up efforts to promote B shares, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Market sentiment was improved by the news, which reflects the government's attitude towards the B share market,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is certainly good news for the B share market,&quot; an analyst with a major Chinese brokerage said. &quot;If successful, it will lead to an expanded base of B share investors.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected the market to move slowly higher early next week, with buying focussing on companies expected to post good 1996 results.</p>
<p>China Bicycle was the best performer on institutional buying, rising HK$0.15 or 4.41 percent to HK$3.55 on heaviest trade of 2.03 million shares on institutional buying, brokers said.</p>
<p>The A share index firmed 3.06 points or 0.81 percent to close at 382.63 points on turnover of 9.54 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected the gains to extend into next week.</p>
<p>Building materials producer Shenzhen Universe rose 0.79 yuan or 10 percent to close at limit-up of 8.65 yuan on speculative buying.</p>
