<p>Energy trading in Asia is on threshold of major change as giant New York and London exchanges, plus the smaller Singapore market, vie for region's oil futures business, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) met traders on Wednesday to discuss plans to launch a revised gas oil contract.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, SIMEX announced plans to list a revised fuel oil contract on April 22.</p>
<p>In March, the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) of London said they were looking for ways to quote their crude contract jointly on a 24- hour electronic trading system.</p>
<p>And the Asia-Pacific Advisory Commitee, formed last year to develop NYMEX energy products for Asia, recommended that NYMEX pursue gas oil futures and crude futures contracts.</p>
<p>NYMEX is considering a crude futures contract on a basket of crudes to be settled in cash.</p>
<p>Analysts said the recent burst of activity by global exchanges to list futures contracts that would tempt Asian traders was evidence that the region's energy market had matured and was ready for more sophisticated hedging tools.</p>
<p>Oil traders in Singapore said the gradual deregulation of the Asian oil market meant players would have greater need to hedge their risks as they buy and sell oil for a region that already consumes a quarter of the world's production.</p>
<p>Asia is likely to overtake the United States as the world's biggest oil consumer around the turn of the century and the region is ready for sophisticated hedging tools that will help boost liquidity in derivatives and futures trading, they said.</p>
<p>Since January, South Korea and Philippines have started to deregulate their oil markets. Japan started in April last year.</p>
<p>&quot;This region has the greatest potential for growth,&quot; said a source at SIMEX.</p>
<p>&quot;On average, North America consumes about 20 million barrels and Europe 16 million barrels per year. On the exchange, NYMEX trades about 150,000 contracts per day and IPE about 60,000 contracts per day,&quot; an oil broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;Asia consumes about 18 million barrels of oil but trades a mere 300 contracts daily on SIMEX,&quot; the broker said. &quot;This region is going to be the next most lucrative market for futures exchanges and we could see phemomenal growth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>SIMEX list two energy futures contracts -- the Brent contract and the original high sulphur fuel oil contract, launched in 1989 but dormant since August 1995.</p>
<p>The Brent contract trades during Singapore hours on a mutual offset basis against Brent traded on London's IPE.</p>
<p>SIMEX launched a gas oil futures contract in 1991 but it was delisted in 1993.</p>
