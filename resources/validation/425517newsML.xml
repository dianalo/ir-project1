<title>NORWAY: Statoil in new drill project at Gullfaks.</title>

<p>Den norske stats oljeselskap AS (Statoil) said on Thursday it had begun drilling on the North Sea Gullfaks field using a new pioneering technique which is expected to extend the life of old producer wells.</p>
<p>The company's Status Weekly newsletter said the first sidetrack well to be drilled with coiled tubing had been started from the Gullfaks A platform.</p>
<p>The well is due to drill 300 metres horizontally, the sidetrack begins from the 2,500 metres deep A-10 well -- an old producer which has ceased to flow. Drilling horizontally makes it possible to reach a different part of the reservoir from that produced by the main well.</p>
<p>&quot;If expectations are borne out, the new well will be able to produce oil for two to three years,&quot; Statoil said.</p>
<p>The state oil company said it had identified 34 new drilling targets to tap undrained sections of the reservoir. Twenty-three of these will be drilled with coiled tubing.</p>
<p>Statoil said the technique was economic because it uses an existing well.</p>
