<p>Alex Zuelle tightened his grip on the Tour of Spain when he emerged from the mist to take the mountain finish of the 15th stage on Sunday.</p>
<p>In another masterful display, Zuelle launched a late attack to catch Spain's Jose Maria Jimenez near the line. He was followed home by fellow Swiss riders Laurent Dufaux and Tony Rominger and French team mate Laurent Jalabert.</p>
<p>In the provisional overall standings, Zuelle leads Jalabert by one minute 21 seconds with Dufaux just over four minutes further back.</p>
<p>Three-times winner Rominger has been out of contention since losing nearly eight minutes in the third stage but on Sunday reinforced his bid to take the king of the mountains prize.</p>
<p>The 210-km stage was ridden in cold, wet conditions, the riders finishing almost an hour later than organisers had expected.</p>
<p>After hauling in a breakaway group of five riders, the leaders arrived together at the final 15-km climb to Alto Cruz de la Demanda.</p>
<p>Jimenez broke for the line four kilometres from home and looked to have the stage sewn up before Zuelle appeared out of the mist in the last 100 metres.</p>
<p>With Jimenez's Banesto team and Spanish cycling in general still smarting from Miguel Indurain's decision to quit the Tour, it was a cruel blow.</p>
<p>A Spaniard has yet to win a stage. Italian riders, by comparison, have already taken nine stages.</p>
<p>In an interview published by sports daily Marca on Sunday, Indurain criticised those who were trying to &quot;bury&quot; him.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people think I'm dead, but here I am...(they) want to say I've retired without even asking me,&quot; said Indurain, reiterating that he had yet to decide on his future plans.</p>
