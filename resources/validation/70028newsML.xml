<p>Nigerian police said on Monday they were searching for Shi'ite Moslem leaders in connection with riots last week in the northern city of Kaduna in which seven people died.</p>
<p>&quot;For now we are still hunting the local leaders,&quot; Police Commissioner Yakubu Shaibu told Reuters by telephone from Kaduna.</p>
<p>Two police and five Shi'ites were killed when supporters of the fundamentalist Shi'ite Moslem Brotherhood group demanding the release of their arrested leader, Sheikh Ibrahim Yakub El-Zak-Zaky, fought police last Wednesday.</p>
<p>On Friday, 35 people were brought before a Kaduna magistrate court charged with incitement, public disturbance, unlawful assembly and murder of two police officers.</p>
<p>Shaibu said there had been no more arrests since Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The arrests are still going on, we expected them because we are challenging the system,&quot; Mohammed Ciroma, a spokesman for the Moslem Brothers said by telephone from Zaria, near Kaduna.</p>
<p>Police say El-Zak-Zaky, a radical preacher, was arrested because of illegal publications and radio broadcasts. He was also alleged to have imported arms.</p>
<p>The Shi'ite group says 14 people were killed in clashes with police a day after El-Zak-Zaky's arrest.</p>
<p>The group is campaigning for imposition of Islamic Sharia law in Africa's most populous nation, although only about half the 100 million people are Moslems, predominantly Sunni.</p>
<p>&quot;We are just trying to continue with our programme as usual, teaching Islamic philosophy and working to deliver Nigeria from this corrupt system of government,&quot; Ciroma said.</p>
<p>The mainly Moslem north has been the scene of bloody religious riots in the past.</p>
<p>Last month three people were killed in a clash between rival Moslem sects in Kano, the region's biggest city.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is calm now and we do not expect any more trouble,&quot; said Shaibu.</p>
