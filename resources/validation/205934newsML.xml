<p>Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko said on Thursday that the parliamentary vote on the 1997 taxes, which split the ruling leftist coalition, showed government's two parties had little in common regarding their programmes.</p>
<p>&quot;I am concerned about what can happen next. It seems that regarding the programme the coalition of the (ex-communist) Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) does not exist,&quot; Kolodko told reporters after the vote.</p>
<p>Kolodko, a non-party economist, praised the biggest opposition party, the centrist Union for Freedom, for helping the SLD defeat the Peasants' proposal for a deep cut in the personal income tax for lowest-paid.</p>
<p>He earlier said such a cut would have boosted the budget gap beyond reasonable limits or require radical spending cuts.</p>
<p>Kolodko suggested a coalition of SLD and the Union would serve better Poland's economy.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that on the ground of this coalition, which made decisions beneficial for the economy and the society, we could try to build something new and better,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But both coalition partners rushed to distance themselves from Kolodko's statements.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Kolodko is exceeding his prerogatives,&quot; SLD leader Jozef Oleksy said. </p>
<p>The Union for Freedom, rooted in the Solidarity movement that toppled communism in 1989 has refused so far to to form a coalition with the SLD as a heir to the old regime.</p>
<p>The Union distanced itself from Kolodko's statement.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not put any equation mark between today's vote and political configuarions,&quot; Union's deputy Jan Krol said.</p>
<p>The SLD-PSL coalition has survived numerous crises during three years of its uneasy alliance and political analysts predict it should last until general elections due late next year as both parties were keen to cling to power and saw few viable alternatives before the vote.</p>
