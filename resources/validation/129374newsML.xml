<p>Ousted Afghan military chief Ahmad Shah Masood heralded his advance on Kabul on Sunday with a volley of rockets into its airport but then suffered a reverse in a counterattack by the Taleban militia, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They said the purist Islamic militia hit back in the late afternoon, driving Masood's largely ethnic Tajik forces back several kilometres (miles)</p>
<p>Early in the day, building on a series of successes which brought them within rocket range of the much fought-over capital, Masood's men had driven to within 18 km (11 miles) of the city.</p>
<p>But witnesses said they had been driven out of Hussein Kot, 20 km (12 miles) from Kabul, by the Taleban counterattack.</p>
<p>They said Masood's men had pushed about two kilometres (one mile) south of Hussein Kot, a village on the main road south to Kabul, after taking it in the morning.</p>
<p>But by dusk a fierce battle was under way just to the north of the village, which was again under Taleban control.</p>
<p>Masood's men had been confident of driving on Kabul in a short time, with a relatively short stretch of lightly-populated dusty plain before his men reached the entrance to the Kabul valley.</p>
<p>&quot;God willing, we will be in Kabul today or tomorrow,&quot; Masood commander Gul Haider said earlier in Hussein Kot, which the Taleban were peppering with mortar, artillery and rocket fire.</p>
<p>Masood spokesman Mirabuddin Astana told reporters the Uzbek forces of Abdul Rashid Dostum, which joined the Tajiks last week, were pushing down a parallel road to Kabul and were about 30 km (18 miles) from the city.</p>
<p>Travellers said later there did not appear to have been any significant change in the front line on that road.</p>
<p>Shortly after Masood took Hussein Kot, a barrage of rockets exploded around Kabul airport where the Taleban, who took the capital three weeks ago, base part of their air force.</p>
<p>Reuter correspondent Kurt Schork, travelling with Masood's men, said they were fired by a multiple rocket launcher near the village. &quot;Those are headed for Kabul airport,&quot; Masood officer Shirin Agha told reporters.</p>
<p>He said reinforcements were still streaming south, building up the mass of military force needed to sustain the counter-offensive which has brought Masood from the Pansjher valley, 90 km (60 miles) to the north, to within reach of Kabul in little more than a week.</p>
<p>At least seven rockets landed within the perimeter of the sprawling airport and aircraft, civilian and military, immediately took off.</p>
<p>Most of the rockets landed at the military end of the airport and some of the aircraft moved to the other side. Others flew off and did not return. There were no reports of casualties or damage.</p>
<p>The city, which has been ravaged by factional fighting over the past four years, took the barrage in its stride, but the explosions were a stark reminder of just how close is yet another battle for control of the capital.</p>
<p>Taleban spokesmen declined to talk to reporters about what their ultra-conservative movement would do, but they have previously spurned warnings from Masood to quit the city or face a fight.</p>
<p>They have said the Taleban have enough men to defend Kabul, but their fighters on the rear lines showed signs of alarm as Masood's men inched ever nearer the capital.</p>
<p>At the top of the pass leading into Kabul on Sunday morning, a Taleban guard pointed his gun at a Taleban pickup truck and told the driver to get back to the fighting. He was allowed to go on only after pointing out a wounded fighter in the back.</p>
<p>Masood's latest breakthrough came on Friday when, with the backing of Dostum's artillery, he took Bagram airbase some 50 km (30 miles) north of Kabul.</p>
<p>Since then he has pushed another 25 km (16 miles) south along the main road in heavy fighting and some of the few people allowed to travel to Kabul from the area say there have been a lot of civlian casualties.</p>
