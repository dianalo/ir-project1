<p>Japan's newest political party, emerging as a bulwark against the return of the old guard in Sunday's general elections, is headed by two baby boomers whose careers suggest they belong in separate camps.</p>
<p>Yukio Hatoyama and Naoto Kan cobbled together the Democratic Party only last month with the aim of creating an alternative to the Liberal Democratic Party and Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), two large conservative groupings.</p>
<p>As members of Sakigake, the minority partner in the Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's LDP-dominated coalition, Hatoyama, 49, and Kan, 50, saw the writing on the wall for the governmental reforms launched after Japan's political earthquake of 1993 ended 38 years of LDP one-party rule.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of overcoming the 1955 system...the LDP and the Social Democrats have coddled it and allowed it to return,&quot; Hatoyama said in a recent speech.</p>
<p>&quot;The politics of cozy relations between politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen are back, and the path to the kind of government reform that would allow this to be broken is nowhere to be seen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Democrats have no monopoly on this message, which blares daily from the megaphones of candidates contesting the 500 Lower House seats.</p>
<p>And sceptics question the use of words like &quot;cozy&quot; and &quot;coddled&quot; by Hatoyama, a mega-rich third-generation politician whose grandfather, Ichiro, a 1950s prime minister, helped found the LDP. Hatoyama left the LDP in 1993, but his senior Sakigake post kept him at the core of subsequent coalition governments.</p>
<p>Enter Kan, who brings the credibility of decades in the opposition wilderness and hero status as the health minister who earlier this year uncovered his ministry's role in covering up a tainted blood scandal in which some 2,000 haemophiliacs contracted HIV, the virus which causes AIDS.</p>
<p>&quot;Japanese appreciate Kan because they have never experienced a minister who didn't merely dance to the tune of his ministry bureaucrats and instead boldly solved a problem,&quot; said Mitsuyoshi Yamada, a college professor who was among hundreds who turned out to see a Kan campaign rally this week.</p>
<p>The maverick minister, who will hold the health portfolio until the next government is formed, moved some of his audience to tears as he described his motives for unveiling the HIV scandal in which health officials allowed the distribution of blood products they knew to be risky.</p>
<p>&quot;My wife once said she felt ashamed to be married to a member of parliament in a country that would allow such a travesty to go unchallenged,&quot; said Kan, who got his start in politics as a student activist in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Kan is arguably the biggest draw in elections expected to attract a record-low turnout -- and the key reason why pundits expect the Democrats to perform better than their brief history and embryonic policy platform would suggest.</p>
<p>The Democrats, made up of 52 rebel lawmakers from Sakigake and the Social Democratic Party, are set to keep those seats and could win as many as 70 seats, according to media polls.</p>
<p>Such a performance would give the Democrats a seat at the table in negotiations to form a new coalition and &quot;enable Kan to hold the fire of reform at the feet of the next prime minister,&quot; said John Neuffer, a political analyst at Mitsui Marine Research Institute.</p>
<p>Voter surveys in major newspapers this week showed the LDP was closing in on a capturing a clear majority, a prospect Hatoyama warned would &quot;turn back the political clock&quot;.</p>
<p>The Hatoyama-Kan team is set to tour urban areas non-stop in the remaining two campaign days, seeking converts among the half of Japan's 98 million voters who polls showed undecided.</p>
<p>The battle against entrenched opponents -- and a deep public cynicism -- will be uphill, one Yokohama housewife said.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be great to see Kan able to continue the kind of work he did at the Health Ministry, but we have been betrayed by politicians too often,&quot; she said.</p>
