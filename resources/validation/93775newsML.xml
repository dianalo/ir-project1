<headline>Malaysia OTCs overshadow Singapore shares at close.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1996-10-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Malaysian shares traded over the counter stole the limelight in the Singapore share market on index fund buying and arbitraging, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Some index funds from Japan are buying Malaysian blue chips,&quot; said an institutional dealer.</p>
<p>He said investors also took advantage of price differentials between Malaysian shares traded on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange and those traded over the counter here.</p>
<p>The Straits Times Industrials Index fell 12.13 points to 2,150.76 while the UOB-OTC index tracking mainly Malaysian OTCs was up 6.73 points to 1,185.76.</p>
<p>&quot;Singapore has reached a stage where people just don't know what to buy. Funds already have their belly full of Singapore blue chips and whatever switching there is, it's already done,&quot; said a dealer from a foreign broking house.</p>
<p>Malaysia's Genting Bhd gained Singapore $0.60 (US$0.43) to S$11.20 and Hong Leong Credit rose up S$0.60 to S$7.40. Dairy Farm led the actives with 6.2 million shares and was up US$0.015 to $0.60. Sentiment on the stock was poor because of its poor earnings, dealers said.</p>
<p>US$1=S$1.41</p>
