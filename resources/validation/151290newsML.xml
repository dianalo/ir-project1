<p>British trade minister Ian Lang is expected to say in the next few days whether or not he is going to block British Airways' proposed alliance with American Airlines, industry sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The industry has been waiting for Lang to give his ruling ever since he received the results on September 17 of a three-month investigation by his Office of Fair Trading (OFT).</p>
<p>But the UK Department of Trade and Industry persistently refuses to discuss when he might make an announcement, pointing out that there is no formal timetable for such vettings.  </p>
<p>&quot;No one is getting any guidance on the timing for this one,&quot; complained one airline source. &quot;I've never known a case like it in this industry.&quot;</p>
<p>Another said the delay may be linked to the fact that Lang has also chosen to decide whether the controversial deal has a case to answer under the European Union's competition law when the European Commission is conducting its own investigation into airline alliances.</p>
<p>&quot;They are desperate to make sure there's nothing (in the ruling) that cuts across what's happening in Brussels,&quot; said an executive with one airline.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think it would be quite embarrassing in this case for the British government to come out with something that was then completely rejected by the Commission,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But there is also speculation that Lang is still trying to reconcile the conflicting arguments for and against allowing the BA/American alliance to go through without a full investigation by the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>
<p>Lang is seen most likely to give the alliance qualified clearance, provided that BA's home hub of London Heathrow is opened up to competition.</p>
<p>However, opponents such as British long haul operator Virgin Atlantic hope he will impose such onerous conditions that the deal won't be able to get off the ground.</p>
