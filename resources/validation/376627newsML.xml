<title>USA: American, pilots under pressure as strike nears.</title>
<headline>American, pilots under pressure as strike nears.</headline>
<text>
<p>American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp, and its pilots union were under increased pressure on Thursday to reach a new contract and avert the grounding of the number-two U.S. carrier.</p>
<p>Early Thursday, the union said it would bargain on what it called a key issue - compensation for pilots who will fly the small jets American wants to buy for its regional carrier.</p>
<p>A union source, who asked he not be identified, called this a significant step toward a compromise, adding &quot;There's no bluff. There's no smoke here.&quot; The union has pledged a strike at midnight Friday if no new contract is reached. Along with pay, a major stumbling block to a contract has been American's plan to use the lower-paid pilots of its commuter line, American Eagle, who belong to another union, to fly the new, smaller jets, a move opposed by the APA.</p>
<p>American has said it needed the lower-paid pilots to compete with other carriers' low-cost regional operations.</p>
<p>The union source said its offer was to fly the new jets under the American banner, and not American Eagle, and to work out pilot pay and work rules, but not some other benefits.</p>
<p>The airline had no immediate comment on the new pilot offer.</p>
<p>As the talks entered their fourth day of non-stop bargaining, President</p>
<p>Clinton was keeping a close watch, saying a strike would have &quot;huge implications&quot; for the country.</p>
<p>Clinton could intervene and name an emergency board to try to resolve the issues. Creation of a board would prevent any work stoppages for 60 days while the board and the two parties tried again to end their differences.</p>
<p>But anticipating a strike, American cancelled almost all its Friday night international flights.</p>
<p>There has been little apparent progress in the talks being held at a downtown Washington hotel. American increased its pay offer to six percent over four years from five percent.</p>
<p>But the pilots, who want 11.5 percent, rejected it.</p>
<p>The impact of a strike is already being felt in many parts of the country where American has a major presence, with travel agents steering potential passengers away from American and American trying to rebook passengers on other carriers.</p>
<p>Areas particularly hard hit will be the Caribbean, now at the height of its winter tourist season, and the Colorado Rockies, a popular destination for skiers.</p>
