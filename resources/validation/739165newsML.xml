<p>Throngs of curious consumers flocked to stores across the United States on Friday seeking the creations of murdered Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace.</p>
<p>While Versace was laid to rest in a quiet graveyard in northern Italy, shoppers crowded into stores to buy the designer's creations.</p>
<p>&quot;The day after (the murder) we started getting phone calls, and since then our Versace clothes have been flying off the racks,&quot; said Carol Selig, owner of the upscale Encore consignment store on Manhattan's Madison Avenue.</p>
<p>She said customers were coming in droves seeking a classic Versace piece. One woman paid $600 for a signatured dress and coat set cut from a colourful, Roman sculpture-inspired print; another paid $200 for a neon-green, super-tight dress.</p>
<p>Versace, 50, was shot to death on Tuesday outside his Miami Beach mansion by a lone gunman as he returned home from buying magazines. Police have mounted a massive manhunt for 27-year-old Andrew Cunanan, a homosexual prostitute and alleged &quot;spree killer&quot; whom they described as their only suspect.</p>
<p>At the 22 Bloomingdale's stores across the country, sales of Versace's secondary, moderately priced Versus line of clothing -- overseen by Versace's sister Donatella -- were up 20 percent, said a spokeswoman for the retail chain.</p>
<p>The retailer created a stark commemorative Versace window display at its flagship Lexington Avenue store, where, along with the Los Angeles branches, demand for the designer's items has been strongest.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Neiman Marcus department store chain reported strong sales of relatively affordable Versace items like $95 ties, $350 five-piece china settings and Versace jeans, priced between $155 and $370.</p>
<p>In the Gianni Versace Boutique on Madison Avenue, sales of the very expensive couture pieces were no brisker than usual, but the store was unusually crowded.</p>
