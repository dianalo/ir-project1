<p>Singapore gas oil swaps barely moved at midday on Friday as traders assessed the impact of the Indian diesel import tender but said sentiment is likely to soften.</p>
<p>State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) has in its July diesel tender, bought 855,000 tonnes in 19 cargoes, higher than traders initial expectations of between 400,000 tonnes and 600,000 tonnes.  </p>
<p>But traders said surplus supplies in the Asian and MidEast markets were more than adequate to meet India's demand and this would offset the initial bullish sentiment caused by the higher than expected award.</p>
<p>June and July gas oil swaps were respectively quoted at $25.20/$25.25 and $25.05/$25.15 per barrel, around Thursday's quotes.</p>
<p>June/July were at about five cents contango on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Similarly, news of an explosion in Taiwan's Taoyuan refinery did not sparked any major movements in prices, brokers said.  </p>
<p>They said any impact of the news would be felt only when Chinese Petroleum Corp (CPC) tenders for more product imports.</p>
<p>CPC sources told Reuters that the fire was put out within an hour but they were uncertain of the damage it has caused.</p>
<p>The refinery was under maintenance when the explosion occurred.</p>
<p>The market however is being supported by the unscheduled shutdown of 55,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Sri Lanka from June 1 for 10-14 days, traders said.</p>
<p>The shutdown has prompted Ceylon Petroleum Corp to tender for more jet and gasoil requirements.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere, regional buying support remained disappointing, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is very little demand from China,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Traders said fuel oil firmed slightly with June quoted at $100/$101, up about 25-50 cents from Thursday. Brokers said quotes were higher on expectations of emerging regional demand and redued arbitrage supplies.</p>
