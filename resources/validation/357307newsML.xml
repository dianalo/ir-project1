<p>The judge in the Oklahoma City bombing case warned prosecutors on Wednesday he had problems with the possible use of handwriting experts to tie defendant Timothy McVeigh to documents the government wants to use in the upcoming trial.</p>
<p>At a pre-trial hearing U.S. District Court Judge Richard Matsch said he doubted the scientific reliability of handwriting analysis.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there's any basis in science for that type of opinion,&quot; Matsch told prosecutors.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you ought to think twice whether you're going to offer these conclusionary opinions,&quot; the judge said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors want to use FBI specialists to testify McVeigh signed documents prosecutors plan to use as evidence.</p>
<p>The judge also said he may allow prosecutors to introduce as evidence hair samples of both defendants, bomb residue and marks from a tool allegedly owned by one of the defendants.</p>
<p>The judge also said he would not exclude for the time being testimony by a British explosives expert who purportedly has knowledge about the type of bomb used.</p>
<p>The judge also decided he would take the jury pool from the 23 counties surrounding Denver instead of the entire state of Colorado as the defence had requested.</p>
<p>McVeigh and former army buddy Terry Nichols, who were charged in the bombing, will be tried separately, with McVeigh going first on March 31. Nichols will be tried at a later undetermined date.</p>
<p>The documents prosecutors want to use were not identified, but the government wants to lay the groundwork to show where McVeigh was in the days ahead of the April 1995 bombing of the federal building in downtown Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people.</p>
<p>The defence argued there were no standards for handwriting analysis and that jurors can decide for themselves whether the handwriting matched by looking at the samples.</p>
<p>Matsch said he planned to allow FBI specialists to testify about their comparisons of similarities in handwriting samples, but not about their conclusion that McVeigh wrote them.</p>
<p>Matsch urged prosecutors to reconsider their plan and if they insisted on having the specialists testify he will hold a hearing on whether such conclusions were scientifically reliable.</p>
