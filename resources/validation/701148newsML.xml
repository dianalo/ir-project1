<p>Ricardo Sa Pinto, who was suspended from the Portuguese national team after assaulting coach Artur Jorge in March, has agreed a move from Sporting Lisbon to Real Sociedad in Spain -- but he might never play for them.</p>
<p>The disciplinary commission of the Portuguese Soccer Federation is expected to announce the result of its investigation into Sa Pinto's conduct on July 10 and it has been reported in Portugal that they will suspend him for 13 months.</p>
<p>Any punishment would be endorsed by FIFA and would be effective abroad which would invalidate the transfer to Spain. However, Simoes de Almeida, Sporting's vice-president said he hoped any punishment would be restricted to Portugal.</p>
<p>Sporting and Sociedad have agreed a deal which involves a four-year contract believed to be worth 700 million escudos ($4.0 million).</p>
<p>Simoes de Almeida said Sa Pinto had requested the transfer because he was struggling to continue his career in Portugal &quot;in a hostile atmosphere&quot; after his assault on Jorge.</p>
<p>Sa Pinto said he had hit Jorge because he was angry with the coach for saying he had excluded him from the national side because of disciplinary problems.</p>
<p>Jorge may also leave Portugal and reports from Scotland link him with the vacant head coach's job at Glasgow Celtic.</p>
