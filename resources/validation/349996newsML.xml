<p>The attempted murder and abduction trial of ex-FBI agent Eugene Bennett enters its second week on Monday in a case where he says his former wife's lesbian affair with crime novelist Patricia Cornwell drove him to insanity.</p>
<p>Bennett is accused of holding a minister hostage in order to force ex-wife Marguerite &quot;Margo&quot; Bennett, to the scene as well as with planting bombs at her job. At the time, he was locked in a bitter divorce with Margo and a custody struggle for their two daughters.</p>
<p>Bennett, who faces nine felony charges, pleaded not guilty due to insanity. His lawyers told the jury last week his rage over Margo's lesbian affair with best-selling novelist Patricia Cornwell helped push him to the brink of insanity.</p>
<p>At the start of the trial last week, Margo Bennett admitted under oath she had two &quot;intimate encounters&quot; with Cornwell in 1992. She said the two met and became friends while Margo was an instructor at the FBI training academy in Quantico, Virginia, where Cornwell was conducting research for her novels.</p>
<p>But Margo denied her relationship with Cornwell contributed to the bitter, and ultimately violent, breakup of her marriage. She said she believed Bennett did not have any knowledge of the lesbian affair until several months after he filed for divorce in September 1992.</p>
<p>She also said she told her husband his accusation that she was homosexual was &quot;totally inaccurate.&quot;</p>
<p>The intimate relationship between the two women was confined to two encounters, she said. &quot;I have not talked to her or seen her for four years.&quot;</p>
<p>Cornwell had admitted being &quot;great friends&quot; with Margo and that they made frequent visits to each other's homes, sometimes in Bennett's presence.</p>
<p>The writer's agent, Esther Newburg, has refused comment on the court testimony. &quot;I find the whole thing typical of what's going on in the American press today,&quot; she said. &quot;I certainly hope this sells more books for Ms. Cornwell.&quot;</p>
<p>Cornwell's most recent novel, &quot;Hornet's Nest,&quot; currently appears on several best-seller lists. She was not expected to testify at the trial.</p>
<p>Bennett is charged with taking a minister hostage in a Dale City, Virginia church last June 23, in an effort to lure his wife into confrontation. The minister was allegedly forced to telephone Margo and summon her to a meeting at the church.</p>
<p>Margo, herself a former FBI agent now working as a police officer, came to the meeting armed with a handgun. When she stepped inside the church she was rushed by Bennett, who, she said, was wearing a ski mask and wielding a gun.</p>
<p>The confrontation ended when Margo took a shot at Bennett. The shot missed but caused him to flee, authorities said.</p>
<p>Bennett was arrested several hours later at his home after a four-hour stand-off with police.</p>
<p>In addition to abduction and attempted murder charges, Bennett is also accused of planting bombs at three campuses of Northern Virginia Community College where Margo works.</p>
<p>If convicted on all charges, Bennett could face a prison sentence exceeding two life terms.</p>
<p>The trial was expected to last through next week.</p>
