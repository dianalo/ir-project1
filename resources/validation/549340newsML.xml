<p>Madge Networks NV said it expects to report a loss in its second quarter and return to profitability by the third or fourth quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the next quarter or so we will still be getting our house in order,&quot; Chief Financial Officer Kevin Evans told Reuters at the Hambrecht &amp; Quist technology conference here.</p>
<p>&quot;As we begin to look at the back half of the year we will see some growth in revenues that will allow us to return to profitability ... by the third or fourth quarter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He declined to specify how large a loss is expected in the second quarter or how much profits might be in the third or fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Evans said he expects revenues will top $130 million by the fourth quarter and that the company should be able to sustain and grow revenues from that point on.</p>
<p>Until recently Madge specialized in a technology called Token Rings. The company was caught off guard with demand for a rival technology called Ethernet. For the past year Madge has been scrambling to develop new products in the Ethernet area while prices of Token Rings have fallen. It has also had prolems with its sales force.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 1997 Madge reported a loss of $4.8 million, or $0.11 a share, on revenues of $107.4 million. In the first quarter of 1996 it had profits of $2.7 million, or $0.06 a share on revenues of $132.8 million.</p>
<p>The company has reorganized its sales force by using value added resellers, or VARs, instead of using direct sales. When asked would Madge be cutting its sales staff in the coming quarter Evans replied &quot;that's correct.&quot;</p>
