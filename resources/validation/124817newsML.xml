<p>U.S. financial markets will shrug off the final debate between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole which focused little on economic issues and posed no clear-cut winner, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt anyone on Wall Street came away with any fears. Neither candidate made comments that will either rile or boost the markets,&quot; said Christopher Low, senior economist at HSBC Markets Inc.</p>
<p>The debate was vital to Dole who before the face-off in San Diego lagged behind his Democratic rival by double digits in public opinion polls.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Republicans have to be unhappy about the debate because it obviously was not a great win for Dole. I don't think he did well enough to make a difference,&quot; said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Dole, in a surprise move, challenged Clinton to a third campaign debate, to be focused on the U.S. economy, before the November 5 election.</p>
<p>Clinton did not immediately respond to the offer.</p>
<p>Economists said they stand sufficiently clear on both candidates economic proposals and such a debate would be unnecessary.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think Wall Street is confused about the differences between the men's policies, so I do not think Wall Street would benefit from it -- but perhaps the American people might,&quot; said Dana Johnson, head of research at First Chicago Capital Markets.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think a third debate is going to happen. It's wishful thinking on Dole's part,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>HSBC Markets' Low said clients had told him they would have liked more clearly delineated economic proposals from the candidates. However, Low said a published report rather than a public debate might be more forthcoming.  </p>
<p>&quot;People would like to see more of the dollars and cents,&quot; said Low, regarding the candidates' budget proposals.</p>
<p>Numerous U.S. economists said they did not watch the debate as market-moving questions were unlikely to be asked due to the town-hall format.</p>
<p>One analyst said he had scheduled a client dinner weeks in advance, betting the debate would be a non-issue for the U.S. Treasury market, his specialisation.</p>
<p>The candidates answered questions construed and asked by a randomly selected group of 113 undecided voters whose queries focused more on social than economic concerns, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;This debate will have little impact on the election or Wall Street. There was nothing new or shocking about it with no great gaffe or error committed by one or the other,&quot; Metz said.</p>
