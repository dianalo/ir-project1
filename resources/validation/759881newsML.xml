<title>MALAYSIA: KL shares end down as focus shifts to small caps.</title>
<headline>KL shares end down as focus shifts to small caps.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-07-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Small capitalised shares were in focus as the Kuala Lumpur stock market ended another day edging down on thin volumes, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>Blue chip shares mostly languished for want of attention.</p>
<p>The key Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index was down 11.85 points or 1.14 percent at 1,029.41. The small capitalised shares second board index was down 2.41 points at 547.88.</p>
<p>&quot;It's boring. It's dreary,&quot; said Amarjit Chhina, an analyst at BZW in Kuala Lumpur. He said the market, particularly overseas investors continued to watch for movements in the ringgit and interest rates.  </p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors who have underweighted Malaysia, have done so for specific macro-concerns -- currency and interest rates -- those concerns are yet to be alleviated,&quot; Chhina said.</p>
<p>Dealers said forecasts by some overseas researchers that the ringgit will go to 2.70 to a dollar against 2.65 now was keeping investors away.</p>
<p>&quot;The perception is that interest rates will go up,&quot; said Phua Lee Kerk, research head at Jupiter Securities.</p>
<p>While many were staying out of the market, those in were at the moment focusing on the second board shares. &quot;People are avoiding the main board,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If they have to be in the market, the only choices are in the second board,&quot; Phua said.</p>
<p>He said the market was waiting for money supply figures from Bank Negara Malaysia and results of Telekom Malaysia this Friday and Technology Resources Industries Bhd next week to provide direction to the market.</p>
<p>In Monday's trading, Zaitun surged by 3.50 ringgit or 25 percent to 17.50 on heavy volume of 3.16 million shares as speculators rushed into the stock after buying restrictions on Zaitun were lifted on Monday. &quot;Today the designated securities label was lifted. The stock is overvalued but people like to play it,&quot; said a dealer at K&amp;N Kenanga.</p>
<p>Granite Industries plunged on proposals for a three-for-five rights issue, and news that associate Ekran will pay 3.54 ringgit a share for Granite shares.</p>
<p>Granite, a property and construction firm, fell 18 cents to 3.52 ringgit.</p>
<p>Total market volume was 217 million with 157 gainers and 426 losers.</p>
