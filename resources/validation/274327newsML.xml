<title>SOUTH KOREA: Chun, Roh keep South Koreans guessing on appeals.</title>

<p>Former South Korean presidents Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae-woo kept South Koreans guessing on Monday on whether they would launch a final appeal against their convictions for mutiny, treason and graft.</p>
<p>The domestic Yonhap news agency, citing lawyers for the disgraced former presidents, said it was unlikely Chun and Roh would meet Monday's deadline to take their &quot;trial of the century&quot; to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Chun recently told his lawyer Suk Chin-kang that dragging out the case would only &quot;burden the state and the people&quot;, Yonhap said.</p>
<p>State prosecutors said on Monday they planned appeals to the Supreme Court in the cases of 10 former generals charged with Chun and Roh for mutiny and treason.</p>
<p>But they were holding off a decision on the former presidents.</p>
<p>&quot;We will submit appeals against the 10 former aides of Chun and Roh sometime this afternoon,&quot; said Lim Sung-duk, a prosecutor in charge of appeals.</p>
<p>&quot;But we are undecided on appeals against Chun and Roh because they themselves haven't appealed yet. We'll see what they decide to do and then decide ourselves,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We could drop the appeal if Chun and Roh drop theirs.&quot;</p>
<p>A Seoul appeals court last Monday commuted Chun's death sentence to life in jail and slashed Roh's prison term to 17 years from 22-1/2 years.</p>
<p>Thirteen former generals were convicted of mutiny and sedition while one was acquitted. Prosecutors said they would appeal against the acquittal and over jail sentences imposed on nine of the one-time generals.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have been seeking heavier sentences.</p>
<p>Nine businessmen were convicted of bribing Roh. One of them, the chairman of the Dong Ah group, has announced he will appeal to the Supreme Court against his suspended jail term.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court deliberates on the legal basis of criminal convictions and can alter any sentences heavier than 10 years in jail, a prosecution official said.</p>
