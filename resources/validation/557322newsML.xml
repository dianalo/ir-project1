<p>The British stock market looked set for continued uncertainty on Friday as a landslide election victory for Britain's Labour Party prompted talk of tough corporate tax measures in the new government's first budget.</p>
<p>&quot;This result is quite different from the market's expectations of a Labour win of between 30-100 seats,&quot; said Jeremy Batstone, head of research at NatWest Stockbrokers.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not looking like a bloodbath at the moment, but clearly the trend is down.&quot;</p>
<p>The latest tally of seats predicted by the BBC was 421 seats to Labour with the Conservatives on 164. Traders were calling the FTSE anywhere between 30-100 points lower on Friday.</p>
<p>City bookmaker IG Index cut its FTSE closing price spread to 4,410-4,418 by 0320 GMT. The FTSE 100 index closed up 9 points at 4,445 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Prior to the election, investors were nervous about the remote possibility of an indecisive outcome in the poll but as results began to pour in on Thursday night investors started to fret about the implications of Labour's resounding victory.</p>
<p>&quot;The feeling is that the majority is so big that they will have free reign to do whatever they want,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>The skeleton teams at the few City dealing rooms offering all-night trading saw little actual volume but marketmakers protectively marked prices down.</p>
<p>Politically sensitive privatised utility stocks were the hardest hit, with prices reported to be two to three percent lower. Labour has said it will implement a windfall tax on the profits of privatised utilities, but the size of the tax is as yet unknown.</p>
<p>Financials were also marked down on the prospect of a near-term interest rate rise after Labour's soon-to-be Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said he would stick to an inflation target of 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>But the main hurdle for the equity market was expected to be Labour's first budget and the fear that it will hit the corporate sector hard.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's two months before we see a budget, it will leave the market in a very moribund state,&quot; said James Dewhurst, equity salesman at Charterhouse Tilney.</p>
<p>&quot;ACT (advance corporation taxation) is very significant,&quot; Dewhurst said. &quot;Every five percent drop in ACT equates to about 2.5 percent off the market,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Under current legislation, pension funds are allowed to claim back ACT on dividends. Thus, any reduction in ACT will reduce the dividend yield on individual shares.</p>
<p>Mortgage interest relief and other corporate taxes may also come under scrutiny.</p>
<p>&quot;With this kind of majority we're looking at 10 years of socialism not five,&quot; Dewhurst said.</p>
<p>&quot;Utilities will have to wake up to this fact but the ultimate arbiter for the market as a whole will be whether people chose to move into cash or into other sectors.&quot;</p>
<p>In the meantime, dealers said the FTSE would continue to take its cue from Wall Street and the Dow industrials average which has soared nearly 10 percent over the past three weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;After the smoke clears the market is going to concentrate on the important things, like the S&amp;P 500 (futures contract),&quot; the head of trading at a major brokerage said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dow still looks like its headed into record territory, which will push us to new peaks.&quot;</p>
