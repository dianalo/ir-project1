<p>French shares clawed back some of their opening losses on Wednesday as the market traded cautiously ahead of this afternoon's announcement of cabinet appointments by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, traders said.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 3.93 points or 0.15 percent at 2,620.53 at 0814 GMT, after opening down 0.28 percent. The CAC-40 June futures contract was down three at 2,601 from Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>Volume was 1.26 billion francs</p>
<p>A strong defensive play with buying in oil, food and retail sectors has helped pushed the market higher, a broker said.</p>
<p>Elf Aquitaine rises 1.29 percent to 627. &quot;Elf if definitely pulling the market,&quot; a broker said. The oil major has risen strongly since last Friday's forecast of 35 percent first-half pre-exceptional profit growth.</p>
<p>Total also firms, up 1.12 percent at 541. Between them, the two oils account for market capitalisation of 300 billion francs.</p>
<p>&quot;The big caps have nothing to worry about from the Socialists,&quot; the broker said.</p>
<p>Among index heavyweights, Alcatel Alsthom rises 0.48 percent to 633.</p>
<p>Danone gained one percent to 910.</p>
<p>Retailers which have risen strongly gave back some gains. Carrefour sheds 0.38 percent to 3,895. Promodes eases 0.82 percent to 2,050. Casino weakens 0.55 percent to 270.5.</p>
<p>Accor up 0.71 percent at 855, after the group says 1997 operating profit will rise more than 20 percent.</p>
