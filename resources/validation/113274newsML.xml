<p>Italian soccer champions AC Milan are planning a bourse listing next year and may even float their shares abroad if red tape frustrates efforts to do so at home, an Italian newspaper reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>Milan daily Corriere della Sera reported the soccer club owned by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi had asked U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers and British merchant bankers Rothschild to put a value on the club's assets.</p>
<p>Milan is one of a number of Italian soccer clubs which wants to raise cash on the stock exchange after the government passed a decree law last month allowing them to set themselves up as profit-making corporations.</p>
<p>Previously Italian soccer clubs had enjoyed a special status as non-profit institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;If all goes well we will find Milan on the stock exchange in a year, in the autumn of 1997,&quot; said the club's managing director Adriano Galliani.</p>
<p>The club, which has won the European Cup five times in total and the Italian league championship four times in the past five seasons, enjoys a huge international following and has supporters as far afield as China and Japan.</p>
<p>Several clubs in the elite Serie A division are reported to be interested in listing on the bourse, including Milan's local rivals Internazionale, Turin-based Juventus, Bologna, Napoli and second division Salernitana.</p>
<p>Milan, which is heavily in the red, may have no option but to seek a listing on an overseas stock exchange unless it can find a way round local bourse rules which require companies to show three consecutive years of profit before being allowed to list.</p>
<p>Luxury goods producer Gucci, one of the biggest names in Italian high fashion, was refused a listing on the Milan bourse last year for technical reasons but was later successfully floated on the New York stock exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Italian bourse maintains certain obligations, we will arrange to list our shares abroad,&quot; said Galliani.</p>
<p>Milan is believed to be worth at least 400 billion lire ($260 million). It owns a training complex outside Milan called Milanello and has some of the world's most sought after players in its team, including Liberia's world player of the year George Weah and 1994 Italian World Cup star Roberto Baggio.</p>
<p>But the club's finances have been badly hit by the so-called Bosman ruling which blew open the European transfer market.</p>
<p>Clubs like Milan, which splashed out millions of dollars on star players, are no longer able to collect transfer fees when players move to other clubs after their contracts have expired.</p>
<p>This has wiped out the value of many players on Milan's balance sheet and the club is spreading the losses it has incurred over three years.</p>
<p>The club also paid out 20 billion lire ($13 million) in bonus payments to its players when the team won the league championship for the fifteenth time in the club's history in May.</p>
<p>&quot;The last reporting season, which ended on June 30, is in the red, heavily in the red,&quot; Galliani told the newspaper.</p>
<p>In Britain several clubs including Manchester United and London's Tottenham Hotspur have been floated on the stock exchange. United's shares soared on the London stock exchange on Friday after the club's chief executive Martin Edwards said the club could fall prey to a takeover bid.</p>
