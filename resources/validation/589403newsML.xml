<headline>CZECH PX50 FALLS AT FIX HIT BY CROWN.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1997-05-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Czech PX50 again suffered the knock-on effect of instability in the Czech crown at Friday's fixing with dealers saying the market was waiting nervously for a resolution to the turmoil in the currency markets.</p>
<p>The PX50 dropped 1.15 percent to 508.7.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, the Czech National Bank (CNB) raised the repo rate by 0.5 percent to 12.9 percent and again intervened to support the crown which is curently trading at around minus 3.8 percent from the mid-point of its mark/dollar basket.</p>
<p>Equities dealers said share trading was clearly being affected by the situation in the forex market.  </p>
<p>&quot;(The effect) is mainly (on) blue chips and I think we will probably have to see what happens now,&quot; said Lubomir Vystavel of ING Barings echoing the sentiment of many local dealers that the market was in &quot;wait-and-see&quot; mode.</p>
<p>SPT Telecom fell 22 crowns to 3,213, power utility CEZ lost 10 crowns to 945, Komercni Banka dropped 30 crowns to 1,965 and Ceska Sporitelna fell nine crowns to 291.</p>
<p>Taken together the four issues account for 51 percent of the PX50 index's total capitalisation.</p>
