<p>China is expected to become the world's fourth largest advertising market in the next five years and Western-based ad agencies foresee no problems with the Hong Kong handover, an industry xpert said.</p>
<p>Miles Young, the head of Ogilvy &amp; Mather's Asia-Pacific region, told Reuters late on Thursday that China's advertising industry was forecast to grow by a staggering 40 percent per year through 2002.</p>
<p>He said Ogilvy &amp; Mather, a global ad agency owned by London-based WPP Group Plc, the world largest advertising and marketing services group, had strong faith in China's economy and advertising market.</p>
<p>&quot;China is a very deliberate growth manager,&quot; Young said in an interview.</p>
<p>He said he did not expect the June 30 handover, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule after 150 years as a British colony, to cause any problems or disruption for advertising agencies.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as we're concerned, there are no concerns whatsoever,&quot; said Young, who heads Ogilvy &amp; Mather's Asia operations from its regional office in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;We have our headquarters in Hong Kong and we intend to stay there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Young said China's enormous economic growth and liberalisation had provided a backbone for continued progress, and there was no need to fear the trend would be reversed.</p>
<p>&quot;It's gone too far,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The world's biggest advertising market is the United States, followed by Japan, Germany, France and Britain.</p>
<p>But China, with one of the world's fastest-growing consumer groups, will knock France from fourth place if present growth continues.</p>
<p>Young said Singapore and Hong Kong had been Asia's two most important advertising markets until a few years ago, but that had changed.</p>
<p>Along with China, Asia's greatest growth markets for advertising now included India, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Young said Asian economic growth has sparked a growing appetite for consumer goods.</p>
<p>In China, the government's policy of one child per family had had the effect of boosting the amount of disposable income in many households.</p>
<p>Young said the one-child policy had created a generation of so-called &quot;little emperors&quot;, children who had powerful clout over purchasing decisions made by parents and grandparents.</p>
<p>He said large privatisation programmes in China were fuelling economic growth and spurring many companies to adapt Western-style marketing and branding techniques.</p>
<p>Western-based ad agencies used to get most of their business in Asia by creating advertising campaigns for Western-based multinationals.</p>
<p>But Young said Chinese-based companies were the ones driving the growth of advertising in China.</p>
<p>Local companies account for a majority of Ogilvy &amp; Mather's clients in China, including 60 percent in Shanghai and 70 percent in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Young said China was developping big regional consumer markets and that local companies were using advertising to create national brands and reach those geographically-diverse consumers.</p>
<p>He said China's massive size meant ad agencies needed strong networks with offices across the country. They also need big networks to deal with China's huge and diverse media industry</p>
<p>&quot;It's one of the most diverse media markets in the world,&quot; he said. &quot;There are hundreds of newspapers, television stations and radio stations.&quot;</p>
