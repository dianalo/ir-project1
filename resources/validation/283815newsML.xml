<p>Copper prices shot up on Thursday to probe the key $2,170 resistance level, while its stable mates on the London Metal Exchange (LME) made steady upside progress.</p>
<p>In Chicago, the Commodities Research Bureau Index rose 0.97 points to 240.58.</p>
<p>METALS</p>
<p>In London, light buying attributed to commission houses exaggerated copper price movements amid low volumes in a market still in the grips of the year-end holiday lull, dealers said. Three-months copper ended the afternoon kerb at the day's high of $2,167 a tonne, a gain of $40 from Tuesday, the last time the market was open, and the high since December 20.</p>
<p>January aluminium prices held above $1,500 by the time of the declaration, meaning significant open interest on puts at that strike was not activated. But aluminium followed copper higher to finish the kerb $9 firmer at $1,555, also at the day's highs.</p>
<p>Lead rallied from a low of $694 to finish stronger at $707. Values were initially boosted by the option declaration as $700 calls were declared despite the fact that the market was slightly below the strike at the declaration deadline.</p>
<p>Nickel also moved smartly higher, on the path to recovery from Monday's drop to fresh 2-1/4 lows. It finished the kerb at $6,595, a gain of $130.</p>
<p>Alloy firmed to $1,425, a gain to $25, while zinc edged up $2 to $1,062.</p>
<p>But tin bucked the trend to end $20 lower at $5,820, after Far Eastern selling emerged at $5,840, dealers said.</p>

<p>GRAINS</p>
<p>CBOT wheat futures were higher at midsession Thursday, buoyed by talk of fresh export business and spillover strength from other markets, traders said. Talk was widespread in wheat markets Thursday that Egypt would tender for as much as 500,000 bushels of optional origin wheat for February/March shipment, traders said. At 1134 CST, wheat futures were two to 6-1/4 cents per bushel higher, with March up 5-3/4 at $3.87 a bushel and May up 6-1/2 cents at $3.67.</p>

<p>SUGAR</p>
<p>A dearth of follow-through fund buying and mixed selling pressured CSCE world sugar futures sharply lower by midsession, dealers said. The move capped six consecutive days of firmer prices and surprised several floor sources, who had expected prices to linger around current levels or pierce firm resistance at 11.05 in March. Prices rose from the lows. At 1135 EST, March was down 0.14 at 10.86, traded 10.98 to 10.78. The back months were 0.12 to 0.08 weaker.</p>

<p>GOLD</p>
<p>New York precious metal futures remained weak at midday Thursday after COMEX February gold slipped to a life-of-contract low of $367.50 an ounce at midmorning. &quot;Activity is still not very heavy, with many people still out for the holidays, but we saw some fund selling early which overcame some trade support, leaving the market a bit nervous,&quot; Rosko Futures floor trader John Rosko said. COMEX February gold was down $1.30 at $367.90, traded from $369.40 to $367.50. Estimated volume was 16,000 lots. Spot gold in the bullion market was quoted at $366.30/80 after fixing at a three-year low of $366.55 in London Thursday afternoon compared to Tuesday's New York close of $367.45/95. COMEX was cl</p>

<p>OIL</p>
<p>NYMEX heating oil held on to slim gains Thursday afternoon on higher gas oil futures on London's IPE, but heating oil faced downside pressure from declines in crude. January gas oil closed up a sharp $8.25 at $232.00 a tonne on the IPE due to cold weather in Europe. Profit-taking pushed February crude off 12 cents to $25.80 a barrel. &quot;Crude wants to go lower, and crude is dictating products,&quot; said Rocky D'Esposito of RJ Futures, explaining crude is capping heat's gains, but he said volume was light.</p>
