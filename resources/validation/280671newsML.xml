<title>USA: More storms forecast for U.S. Pacific Northwest.</title>
<headline>More storms forecast for U.S. Pacific Northwest.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-12-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>A series of winter storms were expected to hammer the U.S. Pacific Northwest over the next four days, bringing more rain and snow from Washington to south-central California, weather forecasters said.</p>
<p>The West Coast was pounded this weekend by storms which produced heavy rain and snow and extremely strong winds.</p>
<p>&quot;The same region that was slammed by heavy rain, ice and snow last week is expected to get more of the same this week,&quot; Weather Express Inc chief forecaster Fred Gesser said.</p>
<p>But warmer temperatures were expected which could spark more flooding in the Washington and Oregon coastal regions.</p>
<p>&quot;The good news is that temperatures will be warmer with these upcoming storm systems allowing for more rain to occur and less snow and ice,&quot; Weather Services Corp meteorologist Mike Palmerino said.</p>
<p>&quot;The bad news is that additional moisture falling on already saturated soils on a deep snow pack could increase the chances of more flooding in northern California and western portions of Washington and Oregon,&quot; Palmerino added.</p>
<p>He noted that milder temperatures could improve the movement of goods. A large amount of U.S. spring and white wheat is exported out of Pacific Northwest ports mainly to the Pacific Rim.</p>
<p>Palmerino forecast temperatures of around 45-55 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and dropping down to 40-45 degrees F at night from Seattle to San Francisco for most of this week.</p>
<p>This week, warm and dry conditions were also seen for the hard red winter wheat belt. Gesser predicted spring-like temperatures from Kansas southward, without moisture, through Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Models Monday continue to show a storm system developing in Kansas on Friday and Saturday which might bring light rain and or snow in western Nebraska and western Kansas. That should give some moisture to the HRW crop,&quot; Gesser said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are talking anywhere from upper 50s to low 70s (F) during the day and lows in the 30s (F) at night,&quot;  Weather Services' Palmerino said, referring to wheat and livestock areas in west Texas, western Oklahoma and western Kansas.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point, the HRW wheat crop has adequate moisture but these expected mild temperatures could bring some of that crop out of dormancy, especially in west Texas, western Oklahoma and extreme southwest Kansas,&quot; Palmerino said.</p>
<p>But in south-central Kansas, the HRW wheat crop looks very good, said Bill Heer, agronomist with Kansas State University in Hutchinson, Kansas.</p>
<p>&quot;The forecast of temperatures in the low to mid 50s (F) is not expected to really influence the wheat one way or the other,&quot; he said. He pointed out that soil temperatures in south-central Kansas were about 32 degrees.</p>
<p>&quot;The crown of the wheat is down in the soil itself and the cold soil temperatures will have more influence,&quot; Heer said. &quot;That keeps the wheat dormant.&quot;</p>
