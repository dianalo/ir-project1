<p>Minnesota legislators on Monday rejected numerous funding plans for a new stadium for the Minnesota Twins American League baseball club.</p>
<p>The senate tax committee late Monday afternoon rejected plans that would have called for expanded casino gambling to raise revenue for a retractable roof stadium estimated to cost more than $400 million.</p>
<p>And earlier Monday, the house tax committee rejected proposals to finance a stadium through cigarette tax hikes or expanded gaming and then further declined to advance a bill calling for a ticket buyout to tie the Twins to their lease in the Metrodome.</p>
<p>Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson, a strong supporter of a new stadium, was disappointed by the decisions, but does hope for further action before the end of the session next week, spokesman Brian Dietz said.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess the next step would be can it be revived anywhere within the legislature,&quot; Dietz said. &quot;Or else, there is talk about legislation that would study it over the summer. That is certainly an alternative, although I don't know if it is the best one out there.&quot;</p>
<p>Dietz said it is too early to consider the possibility of a special session for the stadium. Carlson has already considered the possibility of a special session in the late summer or early fall to address funding for flood damage.</p>
<p>Before the senate tax vote, Dietz had said that the house decision on the stadium made approval of a new ballpark an uphill battle. Other controversial proposals have been voted down by legislators numerous times in past sessions only to be approved later, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly feel that without a new baseball stadium for the Twins they will leave Minnesota in the next couple of years,&quot; Dietz said.</p>
<p>The Star Tribune reported Monday that the Twins franchise has few options for relocating in the next few years, but Dietz said the governor &quot;believes the threat is there.&quot;</p>
<p>After the house vote, but before the senate vote, Twins spokesman David St. Peter said the team will remain patient.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the most important thing that we want to have come out of this is continued discussion,&quot; St. Peter said. &quot;We think there has been progress made. We believe we have overcome some hurdles along the way.&quot;</p>
<p>House Majority Leader Ted Winter, D-Fulda, plans to introduce a bill in the planning and fiscal policy committee to study the importance of professional sports to the state, according to Gerrie Boice, a legislative aide to the house tax committee.</p>
<p>The Twins lease runs through 2011, but includes an escape clause giving the Twins an out after the 1998 season if ticket sales are poor in relation to the rest of the league or if the ballclub loses money three years in a row.</p>
<p>Minnesota's legislature is scheduled to adjourn May 19.</p>
