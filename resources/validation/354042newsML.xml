<title>TAIWAN: Senior China officials to tour Taiwan despite row.</title>
<headline>Senior China officials to tour Taiwan despite row.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-02-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>A group of senior Chinese officials will visit Taiwan in February despite a 19-month-old freeze in unofficial relations between Taipei and the rival communist mainland, the Taiwan hosts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The delegation arriving on February 20 would include Wang Xiaomin, daughter-in-law of one of China's most influential elders, retired parliament chief and Communist Party politburo member Wan Li, the sponsoring Chinese Youth International said.</p>
<p>Wang, who will act as adviser to the semiofficial All-China Youth Federation, is a key member of Beijing's apparatus for dealings with rival Taiwan as deputy director of the exchange bureau of the communist cabinet's Taiwan Affairs Office.</p>
<p>She will visit privately but is expected to meet informally with officials of Taiwan's exiled Republic of China government as well as the Straits Exchange Foundation, a state-funded body formed for such cross-strait contacts.</p>
<p>The trip would precede by several weeks an expected visit by Tibetan Buddhism's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, who, like Taiwan's Nationalist leaders, is seen as a &quot;splittist&quot; seeking to break from the Chinese motherland.</p>
<p>Beijing views Taiwan and Tibet as parts of China.</p>
<p>Wang and a 20-member team led by Bayinqolu, a vice president of the All-China Youth Federation and official of the Communist Youth League of China, were invited by the Taiwan youth organisation for an eight-day visit, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Nineteen months ago, China clamped a freeze on what had been slowly warming unofficial talks with Taiwan, which Beijing has seen as a renegade province since a civil war divided them in 1949.</p>
<p>Despite the freeze, since mid-1996 Taiwan has entertained a broad range of senior officials from China's central and provincial governments -- most of whom had never been allowed to visit the Nationalist-ruled island in the past.</p>
<p>Taiwan officials said the flurry of visits indicated that Beijing had relaxed restrictions on visits by mainland officials whose responsibilities touch on Taiwan.</p>
