<p>U.S. spot residual fuel prices mostly lost ground Monday in sluggish activity, with sinking crude and gas prices amid forecasts for milder weather later this week fueling more bearish sentiment, sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Winter's just about over, and with crude and gas moving off, no one wants to buy anything,&quot; said one cash trader, noting East Coast supplies seemed particularly well-offered.</p>
<p>In New York Harbor, physical one percent eased 25 cents or more to $16.25-50 a barrel, with March one percent paper, pressured by cratering crude, down slightly to about $16, traders said.  </p>
<p>NYH Q2 one percent paper sold at $15.75 after quotes earlier in the low-$16 area.</p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour notionally slipped slightly to $17.25-50, traders said.</p>
<p>NYH high sulphurs also were down modestly, with 2.2 percent now at about $15.25.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, prices were steady to lower, with one percent down to $15.00-25 and three percent still at $13.00-25.</p>
<p>No USG deals were reported.</p>
<p>New York city gate gas prices gained 10 cents Monday to the mid-$2.20s/mmBtu, or about $14.18 a barrel equivalent. Gas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, held steady at about $1.90/mmBtu, or $11.97 a barrel equivalent.</p>
