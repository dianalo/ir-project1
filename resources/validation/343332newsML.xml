<title>UK: Naphtha ends higher in invigorated European market.</title>
<headline>Naphtha ends higher in invigorated European market.</headline>

<text>
<p>NWE naphtha prices rallied slightly on Thursday, invigorated by strong crude futures, heavy swaps buying and traders manoeuvring cargoes like chess pieces in the Med.</p>
<p>High freight rates in the Med have led to cargoes being co-loaded with options to send them either to NWE or the U.S.</p>
<p>Cash traders in NWE said some deals were still getting done at a discount to the swaps prices, underlining an amply supplied local market. Boosted by crude's gains the last two days, Feb swaps ended $1.50 higher at $224.50/$225.50 a tonne and March rose $1.75 to $218.75/$219.75.</p>
<p>NWE cargoes normally would be assessed on a notional basis at a premium to the February swaps, near $226/$228 cif.</p>
<p>But one trader confirmed an 8,500 tonne Russian parcel with 70 paraffinic material was sold on Wednesday at a roughly $2 discount to nearby swaps.</p>
<p>&quot;The notional cargo numbers are above the swaps but the physical trade took place below the swaps,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no real trade on the big ships (in NWE).&quot;</p>
<p>This trader said a 28,000 tonne Skikda cargo was heading to Tarragona, Spain, for early February loading, and that possibly another cargo was heading there later in the month.</p>
<p>Nova fixed a 57,000 tonne cargo from Skikda that originally was heading for the U.S. but, due to unattractive prices, may end up with an end-user in Antwerp, sources said.</p>
<p>A 55,000 tonne Skikda cargo from Mira also has options for the U.S. and Northwest Europe, and sources said at least one piece of that cargo will end up in NWE.</p>
<p>A high paraffinic piece between 5,000 and 10,000 tonnes was sold earlier Thursday at cif high quotes +$3.25, traders said.</p>
<p>One trader said the arbitrage from NWE to the U.S. was shut and that cheaper propane prices there will make naphtha even more unattractive for cracking.</p>
<p>One source said one trader was a heavy buyer in the swaps the last few days, spawning fears of a tigher market in February that indirectly has lifted physical prices.</p>
