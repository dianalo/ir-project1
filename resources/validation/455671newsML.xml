<p>Zairean rebels said on Thursday if the international community wanted to halt fighting it must press ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko for direct negotiations.</p>
<p>Kakudji Gaetan, rebel commissioner for foreign affairs, said the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo- Zaire insists a ceasefire can only follow direct talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We are ready for negotiations at any time and we have always said so. If the rest of the world wants that, then they should put pressure on the other side, not just on us,&quot; Kakudji told Reuters.</p>
<p>African leaders meeting in Nairobi on Wednesday with Zaire's prime minister called for an immediate ceasefire to pave the way for negotiations to end six months of fighting in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>The rebels, who have seized more than a fifth of Zaire and have vowed to press on until they take the capital Kinshasa, were not invited to the summit and said that it would achieve nothing.</p>
<p>The United States, European Union, South Africa and France have demanded a ceasefire. The Zairean government has accepted a five-point U.N. peace plan, the first item of which is an immediate ceasefire.</p>
<p>Rebels on Tuesday declared a ceasefire around the northeast capital of Kisangani to allow in humanitarian aid and the return of those who fled before the city was captured last weekend.</p>
<p>But the rebels demand direct talks with Mobutu, or someone appointed by him, before a general ceasefire and say they will only negotiate on how the 66-year-old ruler, who seized power in 1965, stands down.</p>
<p>Mobutu left hospital in Monte Carlo on Wednesday after treatment for cancer and aides said he would return home this week to lead an attempt to quell the rebellion in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;The president will actively work to contain the situation as soon as he returns home,&quot; Mobutu's son and spokesman Mobutu Nzanga said. &quot;He no longer needs to prove he is a patriot.&quot;</p>
<p>In an interview with CNN on Thursday, he said it was &quot;premature&quot; to discuss negotiations between his father and rebel leader Laurent Kabila. But referring to the Nairobi meeting and a summit of Organisation of African Unity heads of state set for later this month in Togo, the younger Mobutu said: &quot;We hope that a diplomatic solution might be found.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. officials say the Zairean government is &quot;in denial&quot; about the threat it faces from the rebels and is thwarting American efforts to end fighting and promote democracy in Africa's third largest country.</p>
<p>U.S. officials, while denying Washington would back any attempt by the rebels to take over the entire country, say the main problem is Kinshasa's refusal to negotiate with Kabila before a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Officials said a meeting in Nairobi on Wednesday between Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State George Moose &quot;did not go well.&quot;</p>
