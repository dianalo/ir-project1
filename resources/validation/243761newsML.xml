<p>The United Nations on Monday authorised the start of a long-delayed &quot;oil-for-food&quot; deal with Iraq, enabling Baghdad to make a limited return to the world oil market for the first time since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>Under the plan, concluded in May but held up by disputes over implementation, Iraq will be able to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods to help offset the effects of sanctions in force for the past six years.</p>
<p>Both the oil sales and the purchase of humanitarian supplies are subject to close U.N. monitoring. If all goes well, the Security Council may renew the deal when the initial six months expire.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali gave the final go-ahead in a report to the Security Council. Under an April 1995 council resolution, number 986, on which the plan is based, the initial six-month period was to begin at 12:01 a.m. EST (0501 GMT) Tuesday.</p>
<p>In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Glyn Davies warned again that the agreement did &quot;not signal an end or the first step toward the end of the sanctions regime against Iraq, against (President) Saddam Hussein's regime.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the pre-conditions for the full lifting of the oil embargo is word from Rolf Ekeus, in charge of Iraqi disarmament, that he has accounted for all weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>In giving the green-light for the oil-for-food plan, Boutros-Ghali said, &quot;This is a victory for the poorest of the poor of Iraq, for the women, the children, the sick and the disabled. I hope the humanitarian dimension will always prevail in the work of the United Nations.&quot;</p>
<p>He was referring to the dire effects of the sanctions imposed on Iraq since shortly after President Saddam Hussein sent his troops into Kuwait in August 1990.</p>
<p>The U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) has said 4,500 children under the age of five were dying each month from hunger and disease, and the U.N. World Food Programme estimated about 180,000 children under five were malnourished.</p>
<p>The secretary-general, in his report to the council, also said, &quot;I am satisfied that all of the actions necessary to ensure the effective implementation of resolution 986 have been concluded.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the &quot;oil-for-food&quot; arrangement, Iraq will be able to export slightly under 600,000 barrels of oil a day, according to current prices. Before the Gulf War, it exported over 3 million barrels a day.</p>
<p>About $1.32 billion of each $2 billion from the sale of oil will go for humanitarian supplies, including $260 million earmarked for goods for the largely Kurdish-populated north.</p>
<p>Of the remainder, $600 million will be funnelled into a U.N. compensation fund to pay reparations to people who suffered losses during the Gulf War. Another $20 million will go to the cash-strapped U.N. Special Commission in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Administrative and operational costs account for most of the rest.</p>
<p>After months of negotiations, the United Nations and Iraq signed an agreement, or memorandum of understanding, covering the oil deal May 20. But its implementation was further delayed until Iraq accepted all U.N. conditions on Nov. 25.</p>
<p>These include arrangements under which some 150 U.N. inspectors will ensure that the food and other supplies reach all sectors of the population, not just those favoured by the Iraqi government. Another 32 inspectors from Lloyds Register will check on the import of the humanitarian goods.</p>
<p>In addition, 14 U.N. inspectors from the Dutch-based Saybolt company will monitor the outflow of Iraqi oil at three locations -- at a pipeline metering station at Zakho, on the Iraq-Turkish border; at the Turkish terminal of Ceyhan, and at the Iraqi Gulf port of Mina al-Bakr.</p>
<p>Most of the oil is to be exported through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline. The last element to fall in place was a report to Boutros-Ghali last Friday that the metering equipment at Zakho, previously out of order, had been repaired and was now functioning.</p>
<p>In his report to the council, Boutros-Ghali said that the 14 oil inspectors from Saybolt were already in place.</p>
