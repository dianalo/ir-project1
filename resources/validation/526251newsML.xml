<p>China is poised to become the world's most powerful economy within a generation, but will remain a difficult investment environment for another 20 years as reforms continue, an Australian government report says.</p>
<p>Official corruption, opaque and inconsistent rules, inadequate infrastructure and skill shortages will continue to constrain growth, according to the report released on Monday.</p>
<p>The report, &quot;China Embraces the Market -- Achievements, Constraints and Opportunities&quot;, is the work of the East Asia Analytical Unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>
<p>It predicts China's rapid growth would continue as the government maintains the momentum for reforms begun in 1978 under the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>It said China has maintained real average annual growth of about eight percent since 1978, compared with the United States' three percent for the past 15 to 20 years.</p>
<p>&quot;If as is expected the present direction and momentum of policy reforms are maintained, China's output by around 2020 will exceed the USA's,&quot; said the report.</p>
<p>But it said the Chinese economy was only halfway through its transition from a centrally planned to a market economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The arguably more difficult task of establishing the legal and institutional framework needed for a modern market economy is still in progress and will take at least another decade and probably two to complete,&quot; it adds.</p>
<p>&quot;During this process of transition, China will not be an easy environment in which to do business for both foreign and local enterprises.&quot;</p>
<p>The report lists China's economic achievements as the decentralisation of macro-economic management, relaxation on private entrepreneurship, development of basic legal structures, increased labour mobility, high savings and investment rates and open foreign investment and export regime.</p>
<p>In the first 11 months of 1996, foreign funded enterprises were responsible for 41 percent of China's total export trade and 53 percent of its imports, the report said.</p>
<p>China is now the world's 10th largest trading nation accounting for some three percent of world trade.</p>
<p>The report said the internationalisation of China's economy had been &quot;remarkable&quot;, with trade to Gross National Product (GNP) growing to 36 percent in 1996 from 10 percent in 1978.</p>
<p>&quot;China's increasing inter-dependence with the world's trade and investment systems is perhaps the most striking phenomenon of China's recent development,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The report said China's eventual membership in the World Trade Organisation could deliver a 4.6 percent rise in GNP by 2020. &quot;These benefits will arise largely from the productivity enhancing effects of trade liberalisation,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>But growth would be constrained by continued losses by state enterprises, shortages of infrastructure and skilled labour, environmental degradation, incomplete legal systems, growing regional disparities and incomplete agricultural reforms.</p>
<p>China's per capita income is still very low, with the World Bank estimating 350 million people live in poverty. Labour productivity is among one of the lowest in the world, only slightly ahead of India and 10 percent of the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the passage of numerous commercial laws, individuals and firms still face difficutlies in obtaining legal redress and much of the judiciary is poorly trained and insufficiently independent of the Communist party,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>But political stability should ensure continued economic reforms and growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic reform has delivered strong growth and tangible benefits. The leadership also recognises that the economy needs to maintain relatively rapid growth to avoid widespread unemployment and possible social disruption,&quot; the report said.</p>
