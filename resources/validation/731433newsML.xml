<p>Textron Inc Chief Financial Officer Stephen Key said Wednesday he is &quot;comfortable&quot; with analysts' estimates that Textron will earn $3.25 per share for the full year 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Expectations for the year at this time are about $3.25, and I'm comfortable with those estimates at this time,&quot; Key told Reuters in a telephone interview following the release of the company's second quarter earnings.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have posted our 31st consecutive quarter of year-to-year income growth. In mid-point 1997, we're now in a very good position to continue our track record throughout the end of the year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Key said the introduction of new products, acquisitions and international expansion through acquisitions and startups will help drive revenues going forward.</p>
<p>Textron will continue to make acquisitions that fit with its core businesses in the aircraft, automotive, industrial and finance segments, he said. In particular, the industrial and financial segments will be targeted, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our strategy is to strengthen existing core businesses with bolt-on acquisitions and divest those companies which do not fit with the core segment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Parts of the non-core systems and components segment that specialize in government defense business may be sold off, he said, but no acquistions or divestitures are expected within the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Textron has a target of 40 percent of its revenues from international operations by the year 2001, up from 36 percent currently, he said.</p>
