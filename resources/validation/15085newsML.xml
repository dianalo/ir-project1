<title>FRANCE: French capital markets closing report.</title>

<p>Ten-year bond futures settled in negative territory in thin trade with the market weighed down by fears of possible U.S. rate tightening following Friday's strong durable goods orders.</p>
<p>&quot;People are starting to worry about whether monetary tightening could be in the pipeline in the United States,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>In the absence of any major domestic or European news, the United States was driving the French market. Analysts said the outlook for the notionnel contract and the three-month PIBOR was bearish with a tendency for investors to sell on the upticks.  </p>
<p>The market was undermined by the weak performance of the U.S. T-Bond and vulnerable to movements of the franc which continued soft on dollar weakness and concerns about the French budget due next month, analysts said.</p>
<p>Analysts said that in wake of the German rate cut last week, the market had no more good news to look forward to.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a feeling that the Bundesbank has given its all and now the focus is shifting to fundamentals,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's up to the French government to show the market what it can do,&quot; he said.</p>
