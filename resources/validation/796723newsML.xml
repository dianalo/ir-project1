<p>CBOT soft red winter wheat futures closed firmer on a rally in nearby soybean contracts, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Beans took off and locals bought it (wheat) here but there wasn't much volume. We hit buy stops,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Also, there was modest commission house and fund buying near the close with LFG Futures and Prudential Securities each a purchaser of one half million bushels of the December, traders said.</p>
<p>The wheat market held firm despite spillover pressure early from Tuesday's bearish USDA wheat number in its August crop production report, traders said.</p>
<p>USDA said 1997 U.S. wheat production totalled 2.531 billion bushels, above the government's July forecast for 2.431 billion and above an average of analysts' estimates for 2.476 billion.</p>
<p>Also USDA Tuesday pegged 1997-98 foreign ending stocks of wheat at 105.57 million tonnes, above the government's estimate in July for 102.37 million tonnes.</p>
<p>CBOT SRW wheat futures closed 1/4 to 3-1/4 cents per bushel higher, with September up 1/4 at $3.61-1/4. December was up 1-1/4 at $3.77-3/4.  </p>
<p>FIMAT Futures bought two million bushels of September and bought three million bushels of December, traders said. Iowa Grain sold 1.5 million bushels of December and Refco Inc bought one million bushels of December and sold two million bushels of December, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Wheat futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 29,000 contracts, below the 35,491 traded Tuesday.</p>
<p>In wheat options, Tenco Inc sold 100 September $3.60 puts at seven cents, LIT America bought 100 March $4.50 calls at eight cents and LFG Futures bought 100 December $3.90 calls at 12-3/4 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Wheat options volume was estimated at 5,000 contracts, below the 5,672 traded Tuesday.</p>
