<p>The northern Congolese town of Ouesso is believed to have fallen to the militia of former military ruler Denis Sassou Nguesso, aid workers said on Tuesday citing reports by fleeing residents.</p>
<p>News of fighting around the remote town filtered through as mediators in Gabon met Sassou's envoys and those of President Pascal Lissouba in a resumed bid to end two months of battles between their rival forces in the capital Brazzaville.</p>
<p>A staff member of the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR told Reuters that Cameroon officials had reported several people crossing the border from Congo who said they were from Ouesso.</p>
<p>Ousseo is 900 km (560 miles) north of Brazzaville on the Cameroon frontier. Aid workers reported fighting since the weekend in the nearby town of Impfondo to the east.</p>
<p>Ouesso, with some 8,000 inhabitants, is important primarily for timber, which is largely transported through Cameroon.</p>
<p>&quot;We were told by the Cameroon authorities that Denis Sassou Nguesso's troops were thought to be at Ouesso,&quot; said UNHCR's Marie-Christine Bokom who is normally based in Cameroon.</p>
<p>She said in Kinshasa that the UNHCR's information came from the Cameroon presidency.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the Cameroon authorities would have told us had it not been true, but I'm not in a position to confirm the information,&quot; Bokom said.</p>
<p>The UNHCR has sent a team into the region from Yaounde and expects to have more information in the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Aid workers said the northern area around Impfondo and Ouesso is normally sparsely populated.</p>
<p>In the past four months it has filled up with Rwandan Hutu refugees who trekked across the former Zaire fleeing the advance of Laurent Kabila's rebel troops as they advanced to seize power in Kinshasa in May.</p>
<p>Aid workers fear there may have been numerous casualties among the Rwandans around Impfondo.</p>
<p>Lissouba's spokesman at peace talks in Libreville, Gregoire Lefouba, told Reuters envoys of the warring parties in Brazzaville were meeting Gabon's President Omar Bongo on Tuesday, the second day of his resumed mediation.</p>
<p>Bongo met the two sides separately on Monday but the format of Tuesday's talks was not immediately clear.</p>
<p>The Congolese delegations went back to Gabon last Thursday after several days of consultations with their leaders in Brazzaville. The two sides cannot agree on who should be named interim prime minister and what his powers should be.</p>
<p>Fighting in Brazzaville since early June has forced the indefinite postponement of presidential elections last month in which both Lissouba and Sassou were to be candidates.</p>
<p>Well over 2,000 died in militia warfare in Brazzaville following disputes over elections in 1993.</p>
<p>The latest unrest has killed hundreds and devastated whole districts of the city. Plans for a U.N. buffer force in the city have been held up by the lack of a ceasefire on the ground and agreement on international control of Brazzaville airport.</p>
<p>Kabila at the weekend offered his own mediation but this has been received coolly by parties to the conflict and by Congo-Brazzaville's former colonial ruler, France.</p>
