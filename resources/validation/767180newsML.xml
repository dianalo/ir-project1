<title>UK: Brazil Bradys rise on news of central bank change.</title>
<headline>Brazil Bradys rise on news of central bank change.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brazilian Brady bonds extended gains scored late on Tuesday in New York following news of a key change of post at the country's central bank, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The announcement that Brazilian International Affairs director Gustavo Franco had been nominated to replace central bank President Gustavo Loyola continued to boost the price of the country's debt instruments.</p>
<p>&quot;Following news Franco was taking over the central bank in Brazil, &quot;C&quot; bonds traded up about another 1/2 point from yesterday's closing levels,&quot; said one trader at a European investment bank in London.</p>
<p>Franco's position must still be confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p>At 1045 GMT, Brazilian &quot;C&quot; bonds which rose 3/8 following the news on Tuesday, were 1/4 higher at 84-1/2 bid. The country's par bonds were 3/8 higher at 72-5/8 and its discount bonds were 3/8 stronger at 86-5/8 bid.</p>
<p>One trader said Asian buying of Brazilian paper added to the positive tone in the country's debt.</p>
<p>In the broader market, emerging market debt traders said Brady bond prices continued to trend higher on the back of a strong U.S. Treasury market.</p>
<p>&quot;Treasuries are a bit firmer and everyone is convinced this is a proper bull market,&quot; said a trader at a U.S. investment bank in London.</p>
<p>The Brady bond market continued to ride a wave of euphoria despite the release of key U.S. economic data due later this week, they added.</p>
<p>Economic reports include U.S. second-quarter real GDP figures on Thursday and July unemployment on Friday.</p>
<p>In Eastern Europe, Bulgarian IABs were 1/4 higher at 77-1/2 bid and Russian Vneshekonombank dollar loans were 3/8 firmer at 94-3/4 bid.</p>
