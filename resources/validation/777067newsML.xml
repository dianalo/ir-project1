<headline>Rabobank says unilateral Dutch rate hike unlikely.</headline>

<p>Rabobank International said on Monday it believed the Dutch central bank was unlikely to raise short-term interest rates before Germany's Bundesbank.</p>
<p>The bank said in its Financial Weekly publication that given the expectation that the Bundesbank would leave its repo rate fixed at its next meeting, all eyes would turn to the Dutch central bank to see if it would take unilateral action.</p>
<p>&quot;So far, we find it unlikely,&quot; Rabobank said.</p>
<p>It said the Dutch central bank was very reluctant to make such a move, especially in the light of European economic and monetary union, scheduled to begin in January 1999.</p>
<p>Rabobank added it expected a rate hike only if the guilder weakened such that the mark reached 1.1270-75 guilders.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO Hoare Govett said in its Bond Weekly last Friday that the forces which had weakened the guilder in recent weeks would be steady to less intense in the foreseeable future, reducing the risk of a Dutch rate hike.</p>
<p>The Dutch central bank left its money market intervention rate, the special advances rate, unchanged at 3.00 percent last Thursday, despite speculation earlier in the week that it might be raised in response to guilder weakness.</p>
<p>But the guilder clawed back some of its losses, helped by central bank buying of the currency from other European central banks.</p>
<p>At 1355 GMT the mark was trading at 1.1263 guilders.</p>
<p>The repo rate, the German equivalent, is also 3.00 percent.</p>
