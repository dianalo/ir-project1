<p>Japan's Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it would unveil a new concept of cars with smaller engines at the September Frankfurt motor show, and it was considering making them at a new plant in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, we are developing small cars which could be attractive and we hope to present a concept of them in a motor show to be held in Frankfurt in September,&quot; Toyota's president Hiroshi Okuda told Japanese reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;Toyota is considering producing such new cars in Europe as it is important to strengthen our presence in Europe,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Jiji News service reported on Wednesday that Toyota would jointly develop a one-litre car with Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd to sell worldwide after a launch in Japan in 1999.</p>
<p>Tatsuo Takahashi, president of Toyota Motor Europe Marketing &amp; Engineering, said it had not been decided yet when production would start or whether it would launch the new small cars in Japan before starting to sell them in Europe.</p>
<p>Okuda is in Europe to meet reporters from European newspapers as well as Toyota's executives in Europe before flying to South Africa.</p>
