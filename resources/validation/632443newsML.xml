<p>ASIAN FOREX ACTIVITY:</p>
<p>0108 GMT-- *Dollar continued to rise against mark in mid-morning Tokyo, with stop-loss dollar buying triggered at several points such as 1.7110 and 1.7130 marks.</p>
<p>*Further stop-loss buying expected at 1.7185 marks, said a German bank dealer in Tokyo. Clear rise above 1.7120 marks opens way for major dollar/mark rally, he added.</p>
<p>*Win by France's Socialist-led opposition in Sunday's election prompted dollar purchases vs European units due to growing fears of soft euro. Trend likely to continue for while, dealers in Tokyo said.  </p>
<p>*&quot;Both domestic and overseas operators, including speculators, flocked to sell marks in morning trade after the results of the French election,&quot; said the German bank dealer.</p>
<p>*&quot;The dollar's rise above 1.7185 marks may be overdone in the near term, although it could strengthen over the long term,&quot; he added. Sporadic profit-taking emerged after dollar rose as high as around 1.7165 marks, dealers said.</p>
<p>0004 GMT</p>
<p>*Mark fell against dollar and yen in early Tokyo as traders began selling marks in reaction to triumph by France's Socialist-led opposition in Sunday's second-round election.  </p>
<p>*Although victory by left-wing parties mostly anticipated, image of weak euro caused wave of mark sales, dealers said.</p>
<p>*Dollar/yen stuck near 116 yen, top-heavy above 116.50 yen with steady exporter offers.</p>
<p>*A trust bank dealer said mark/yen could be technically supported near 67.75 yen, but dip towards 67.50 yen possible if it clearly breaks through that point.</p>
<p>*Franc had lost ground through Sunday evening after voting ended at 1800 GMT and projections showed a left-wing win, dipping to 3.3840/45 per mark at 2305 GMT from 3.3816 late on Friday.</p>
