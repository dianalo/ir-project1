<text>
<p>Poland's state-owned Pekao SA bank and its group of three other banks decided on Tuesday to raise their referential base credit rates to 26.5 percent from 25.5 percent, Pekao SA's president said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;At the group's meeting today we decided to raise our referential base credit rate by one point to 26.5 percent,&quot; Andrzej Dorosz told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The decision follows the Monday rate rise by the Polish central bank of its two main rates -- the lombard rate by two points to 27 percent and the discount rate by 2.5 points to 24.5 percent. @</p>
<p>Dorosz added that according to the group's agreement the base rates of the all banks in the Pekao SA group might vary by 0.5 basis point from the group's referential base rate.</p>
<p>Dorosz said Pekao SA's credit interest rate currently amounted to 25 percent and so the bank would raise its base rate as well on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Pekao SA group, which consists of Pekao SA, Pomorski Bank Kredytowy SA, Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy SA and Bank Depozytowo-Kredytowy SA, had at the end of 1996 a 20.7 percent share in the total assets of the Polish banking sector and a 11.5 percent share in its combined capital. @</p>
