<headline>Minn. attorney general confirms tobacco talks.</headline>

<p>Minnesota Attorney General Hubert Humphrey said Wednesday that tobacco executives for the largest cigarettes companies have been meeting for the first time with attorneys general to discuss a possible settlement of Medicaid suits.</p>
<p>He told Reuters that while this was a major step by the companies, he was not satisfied with the proposals he had heard so far.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact these talks are going on is a real reflection that these tobacco companies know they are on the ropes,&quot; Humphrey said in a phone interview.  </p>
<p>He said the companies realized they would have to face mounting courtroom battles or would have to come to the negotiating table.</p>
<p>&quot;After 40 years of what they have been doing they are finally at the table,&quot; Humphrey said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm listening. There have been general conversations. There have been representatives directly from the tobacco companies and I don't necessarily feel what I have heard so far is enough..they haven't gone far enough.&quot;  </p>
<p>He said any settlement would have to meet certain requirements including that the industry changes the way it does business, stops marketing to minors and pays an amount that could cover the treatment of smoking-related illnesses.</p>
<p>&quot;We are at beginning stage..this is first time I've ever seen a tobacco representative sitting across the (negotiating) table in the three years that we've been involved in the litigation. This is really significant,&quot; Humphrey said.</p>
<p>Humphrey is one of 22 attorneys general that have sued the industry to recoup Medicaid costs of smokers.</p>
