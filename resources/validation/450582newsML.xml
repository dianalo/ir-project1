<p>Is he a hero or a villain? For some, Krupp chairman Gerhard Cromme is a rare German executive. His sights fixed on the changing global marketplace, he does not shy away from a face-to-face confrontation with angry workers in order to convince them of the need for change.</p>
<p>But to others, say, the Social Democrats (SPD) who have ruled the Ruhr Valley heartland for decades and count on the votes of miners and steel workers, or the blue-collar masses, Cromme, 53, has come to symbolize accelerating job losses.</p>
<p>The IG Metall metal workers union issued a picture of Cromme from 1987 ducking an egg thrown by a steel worker during protests against the planned closure of Krupp's Rheinhausen steel mill. The caption to the picture read: &quot;Gerhard Cromme, mastermind behind the elimination of thousands of jobs.&quot;</p>
<p>After Rheinhausen, Cromme again raised the ire of unions and Social Democrats when in 1991 he launched a rare hostile takeover of rival Hoesch AG. The takeover plunged Krupp into debt and cost more than 20,000 jobs.</p>
<p>It is unusual for Germany, where takeovers are usually neatly managed by the banks that sit on the boards of most blue-chip companies rather than fought out on the stock market.</p>
<p>But that could be changing and if it does Cromme will likely come to be known as one of the industrial pioneers who went against social mores to advance the industrial change that German politicians seem reluctant to bring about.</p>
<p>Cromme's strategy is German companies must be big enough to stand up to international competition, particularly the huge engineering conglomerates in the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>That is what guided the restructuring of the group after the takeover of Hoesch in 1991. Krupp shed non-core businesses and activities where it did not believe it could achieve a leading position on the global market.</p>
<p>This thinking is also behind Krupp's bid for Thyssen.</p>
<p>Krupp pointed out in a statement that 70 percent of the businesses at Thyssen and Krupp were complementary, which means that a merger would create a larger whole.</p>
<p>Cromme has stressed Krupp must seek global dominance in &quot;fields that we understand&quot;.</p>
<p>Rivals Mannesmann and Thyssen, meanwhile, have taken a different path, seeking to shore up core businesses and diversify into new fields such as telecommunications. While this has worked for Mannesmann, Thyssen is on the verge of selling its mobile phone assets.</p>
<p>The significance of Cromme's role does not escape Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest commercial bank which has long believed that a re-organisation of the Ruhr industry was necessary.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG chairman-designate Rolf Breuer, commenting on Krupp's bid to take over rival Thyssen AG, said on Tuesday that German industry was entering a phase of stronger concentration ahead of European monetary union.</p>
<p>He said he was very interested in the Thyssen takeover proceeding in an orderly fashion along the lines of takeovers in the U.K. and U.S., where such events were more common.</p>
<p>&quot;I very much want this first large case in Germany to proceed in an orderly fashion and hope that it demonstrates that the German financial centre is also in a position to carry out a takeover in a manner that is common in other countries.&quot;</p>
<p>If Cromme seems to have the taken the higher ground with industry, Thyssen chairman Dieter Vogel has chosen to appeal to workers' anxiety about job losses that are bound to accompany a takeover by Krupp, warning of &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of job in the event of a merger and sparking massive protests.</p>
<p>Vogel, 55, who took the helm at Thyssen last year, has come under pressure from investors because of what is beginning to look like his failed bid to steer the company away from steel towards telecommunications.</p>
