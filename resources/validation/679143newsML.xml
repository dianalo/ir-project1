<p>Quoting Marxist theory on the fringes of the Group of Seven, France's new Socialist finance minister made his debut on the world stage this weekend promising a mix of left-wing policies and sound economic management.</p>
<p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the smooth-talking finance minister who has impressed outsiders with his fluent command of English and German, reassured his G7 partners that France was committed to European monetary union in 1999, delegates said.</p>
<p>He also went out of his way to bolster his credentials as a &quot;safe pair of hands&quot;, telling reporters he would be the first to be worried if France's budget deficit increased significantly.</p>
<p>But he insisted that France was not going to adopt the kind of &quot;hire-and-fire&quot; flexible labour policies being urged upon it by the United States and Britain to bring down its record 12.8 percent unemployment rate.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no interest in flexibility in the Anglo-Saxon sense of the word,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;What is important is to improve the ability of individuals to become employable.&quot;</p>
<p>The right place for flexibility was in the overall system, &quot;what Marxists would call the superstructure&quot;.</p>
<p>He also said Europe was moving to the left, making possible a decision at an Amsterdam summit last week to intensify political cooperation to boost growth and jobs, a decision of which &quot;we have not yet realised the significance&quot;.</p>
<p>Strauss-Kahn, who accompanied conservative President Jacques Chirac to the G7 talks, said there was no reason to doubt France's commitment to monetary union after the change of government.</p>
<p>But he provided few clues about how the Socialist-led government which was swept to power in an upset parliamentary election victory on June 1, planned to match its commitment to a single currency with campaign pledges to boost jobs.</p>
<p>Worries about whether France would be ready for monetary union resurfaced last week when European Affairs Minister Pierre Moscovici said Paris would decide when it had assessed the state of public finances whether to join a single currency.</p>
<p>Though this was out of line with government policy, it raised fears that some in the Socialist party might be reluctant to pay the price of extra austerity if needed to join monetary union.</p>
<p>Strauss-Kahn declined to say what level of deficit France would consider acceptable to meet a Maastricht treaty requirement to reduce deficits to three percent of gross domestic product in order to qualify for a single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The answer is still the same -- the treaty,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The French government has said it wants a flexible reading of the treaty, taking advantage of a provision which allows a trend towards three percent to be taken into account.</p>
<p>The deficit/GDP ratio would nonetheless probably have to be around 3.2 or 3.3 percent rather than 3.4 percent or more to allow countries to qualify, one delegation source said.</p>
<p>French newspapers have reported the deficit/GDP ratio could be as high as 3.8 percent, confronting the government with a tough choice between austerity and overshooting Maastricht targets.</p>
<p>Strauss-Kahn said he was awaiting the results of an audit due in mid-July for more details on the deficit. &quot;If the audit shows a sizeable deficit, we must look then at what measures need to be taken,&quot; he said, without giving further details.</p>
<p>G7 finance ministers, from the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Britain, met separately here on the fringes of a G7 leaders' summit.</p>
