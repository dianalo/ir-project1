<title>SPAIN: Spain's deputy PM named as &quot;dirty war&quot; witness.</title>
<headline>Spain's deputy PM named as &quot;dirty war&quot; witness.</headline>

<p>Deputy Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos has been called as a court witness after blaming Spain's former Socialist rulers for a 1980s &quot;dirty war&quot; on Basque rebels, defence attorneys said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The lawyers, who are defending an anti-terrorist police chief, said they wanted the new conservative government's number two to testify because he had directly blamed former prime minister Felipe Gonzalez for the 1983-87 campaign of kidnaps, torture and murder against ETA rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;We filed a petition to hear the testimony of Alvarez Cascos based on his statements relating to Gonzalez and the GAL,&quot; one of the lawyers told Reuters. GAL is the Spanish acronym for Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, the shadowy front for the death squads that waged the illegal campaign.</p>
<p>Alvarez Cascos is in charge of Spain's secret services and has unrivalled access to top-secret information. He set off a political storm last weekend when he accused Gonzalez of organising the illegal campaign against ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) separatists.</p>
<p>Gonzalez, who said last week there was no state terrorism during his 13-year rule, has always denied any knowledge of the activities of the GAL. It killed nearly 30 people -- one-third of them by mistake.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court justice investigating the GAL case must now decide whether or not to study the petition before it becomes clear whether Alvarez Cascos will actually be summoned, the lawyer said. There is no set timetable for the rulings.</p>
<p>The people's action, which represents the victims and their families, joined the petition saying it was &quot;vital&quot; that Alvarez Cascos testify in the dirty war investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;If he made these statements it would be because he has proof that Felipe Gonzalez and those near him in the government or in his circle could have participated in the activities of the GAL,&quot; people's action attorney Teodoro Mota said.</p>
