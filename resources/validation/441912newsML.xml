<p>Former England midfielder Nigel Clough looks set to return to first division Manchester City when his three-month loan spell at premier league strugglers Nottingham Forest ends next Wednesday.</p>
<p>Clough, 31 on the day his loan period ends, is in the Forest squad for Saturday's match against his former club Liverpool but that will be his last game.</p>
<p>Clough was keen to make the move from City to Forest a permanent one, but since the signing of Pierre van Hooydonk from Celtic and Ian Moore from Tranmere, and with Dean Saunders and Bryan Roy also in the squad, Clough appears to be surplus to requirements.</p>
<p>Forest's new general manager Dave Bassett said on Friday: &quot;I am trying to generate competition in the squad, and those who do not survive will have to move on. I have spoken to (City manager) Frank Clark, and the likelihood is that Nigel will be going back.''</p>
<p>Clough played almost 400 matches for Forest between 1984 and 1993 while his father Brian was manager before an unsuccesful 2.2 million pounds ($3.5 million) move to Liverpool. He joined Manchester City for 1.5 million pounds ($2.4 million) in January 1996.</p>
