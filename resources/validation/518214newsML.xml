<p>NWE prompt gasoline barge prices were weaker pressured by hedge related selling, while the market's short term contango steadied cargo prices, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are several cargoes showing but the short term contango favours the sellers,&quot; a trader said. &quot;The market will stay on hold for a while until people see how U.S. demand pans out in May&quot;.</p>
<p>Though several cargoes were seen available, traders said the sellers were reluctant to put a price on them due to the current lack of buying interest. Premium unleaded was assessed notionally stable around $196/$197 a tonne cif NWE.</p>
<p>On the key ARA barge market prices for balance of April liftings were under some pressure with one trade house selling the market lower as a hedge against a swaps position.</p>
<p>A barge loading April 25 was heard sold down to $188.25 a tonne fob ARA nearly $3 under the previous trade. Early May liftings faired slightly better slipping only $1 to trade at $193 a tonne.</p>
