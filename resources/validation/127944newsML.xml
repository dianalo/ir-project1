<p>Fears of a wet harvest for part of the 1996/97 Australian wheat crop were sparked by nerves but backed by forecasts of more rain on the way, Alex Nichol, communications manager of the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said.</p>
<p>There had been some damage to the Queensland crop, he said, although the extent of it remained unclear.</p>
<p>&quot;With a big crop out there there is a degree of nervousness amongst growers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>AWB analysts say two weather changes are approaching, with the potential to bring rain, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Crops are just at the vulnerable stage in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales right now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rain was predicted for next week, then further rain five days after that, he said.</p>
<p>It would take some time before the full extent of recent rain damage in southern Queensland was known, he said.</p>
<p>Deliveries which the AWB was receiving at present were still above feed grade, but it was difficult to draw conclusions from that at present, he said.  </p>
<p>The Australian harvest commences in central Queensland, the northernmost part of the wheatbelt, in October and peaks in the December-January period further south and west.</p>
<p>Recent rain and the prospect of more rain has exerted downward pressure on Australian wheat futures prices in recent days.</p>
<p>Most forecasts put the 1996/97 crop around 20 million tonnes although some grain trade sources say it could match the 1983/84 record crop of 22 million tonnes.</p>
