<headline>Global legislators' body probes Indonesian rights.</headline>

<p>The secretary-general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, on a visit to Indonesia, said on Friday he would examine alleged human rights abuses against local parliamentarians.</p>
<p>IPU Secretary-General Pierre Cornillon told reporters after meeting the National Commission on Human Rights that he was gathering information on former Indonesian legislators Sukatno and Sri Bintang Pamungkas.</p>
<p>Sukatno, a former Communist, has been on death row for almost 30 years after a failed coup in 1965.</p>
<p>Pamungkas, ousted by his United Development Party for being too outspoken, has been convicted of insulting the president and sentenced to a jail term. He remains free pending an appeal.</p>
<p>Cornillon, who arrived in Indonesia on Thursday, refused to say whether he would examine the case of ousted minority party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri, or cases of legislators loyal to her who have been questioned by authorities in wake of the July 27 riots.</p>
<p>&quot;I can only report on what I do in public cases,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But in a letter to the speaker of the Indonesian parliament, Cornillon said that his visit was aimed at examining issues raised by the IPU human rights committee, including Megawati's case.</p>
<p>Megawati, ousted by government-backed party rebels in June, remains a member of parliament. She has been questioned three times by authorities since the July 27 riots, the worst violence to strike the capital in 20 years.</p>
