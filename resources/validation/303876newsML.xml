<p>Saying goodbye to a baby son and pregnant wife was difficult, U.S. astronaut Jerry Linenger said on Monday as he headed for a four-month stay on Russia's Mir station.</p>
<p>Linenger, who blasted off aboard the space shuttle Atlantis on Sunday, said he was &quot;raring to go&quot; on his mission to Mir, but as for leaving his one-year-old son: &quot;That was tough.&quot;</p>
<p>Linenger also had to say farewell to his pregnant wife, Kathryn, not knowing if he would be back from space in time for the birth of their second child in June.</p>
<p>Atlantis is due to return to Mir in May to bring Linenger home, but delays are always possible and he knows he could miss the birth.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to be overjoyed at the birth of my next child no matter where I am,&quot; he told reporters from aboard the Atlantis. &quot;I think it's going to be uplifting if I'm up here floating or if I'm down on Earth with my wife.&quot;</p>
<p>Linenger will take the place of John Blaha, who has lived and worked aboard the Russian space station since September. Blaha will return to Earth aboard Atlantis.</p>
<p>During a four-month mission, Linenger will perform about 80 scientific experiments and make a six-hour space walk, the first from Mir by an American.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old Navy captain and medical doctor, who enjoys backpacking, competing in triathalons and skiing, said he made the most of his final days before launch, including a swim in the chilly Atlantic off Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p>&quot;For the last few days I wanted to be an earthling all the way,&quot; he said. &quot;I ran a lot and went down to the beach.&quot;</p>
<p>There will be little room for exercise in the cramped modules that make up the Mir complex apart from daily runs on a treadmill.</p>
<p>Atlantis is on course for a linkup with the ageing Russian space station at 10:53 p.m. EST (0353 GMT) on Tuesday. It will be the fifth time the shuttle has visited the Russian station.</p>
<p>The shuttle was trailing Mir by about 8,500 miles (13,680 km) on Monday morning and was closing the gap by 580 miles (933.4 km) with every 90-minute orbit of the Earth.</p>
<p>Atlantis will spend five days docked at the space station. As well as dropping off Linenger and picking up Blaha, the shuttle will deliver to Mir about 3,600 lbs (1,600 kg) of food and other supplies.</p>
<p>Joining Linenger aboard the Atlantis were mission commander Mike Baker, copilot Brent Jett and mission specialists Jeff Wisoff, John Grunsfeld and Marsha Ivins.</p>
<p>The shuttle is scheduled to return to Earth at Florida's Kennedy Space Centre on Jan. 22.</p>
