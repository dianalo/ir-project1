<p>Japan's contentious external trade surplus is unlikely to be a big political issue at a meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) industrial nations this month, Deputy Foreign Minister Kazuo Ogura said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think that the G7 leaders will specifically discuss Japan's trade surplus and it is not likely to be a major political issue at the summit,&quot; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>The G7 summit is due to be held from June 20 to 22 in Denver, Colorado, with Russia participating in the political discussions.</p>
<p>Ogura, who has been involved in preparations for the summit, said finance ministers of the G7 members -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- may bring up the trade issue.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have expressed concern about a renewed surge in Japan's trade surplus, which jumped 163 percent in April from a year earlier to 831.48 billion yen ($7.16 billion).</p>
<p>A U.S. official said last week that Washington feels U.S.-Japan trade relations are entering &quot;a rather delicate and potentially difficult&quot; period.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and President Bill Clinton agreed in late April when they met in Washington that Japan should avoid a big rise in its trade surplus with the United States and concentrate on boosting its domestic economy.</p>
<p>They are expected to hold bilateral talks on the sidelines of the G7 meetings.</p>
<p>&quot;What is more important (than Japan's economy) for the world economy now is whether the U.S. economy will make a soft landing without inflation and whether Europe can smoothly achieve monetary union,&quot; Ogura said.</p>
<p>Japan's economy is not in a situation now where it can hurt other G7 economies, Ogura said.</p>
<p>Japan maintains that its economic recovery is likely to continue at least through to next fiscal year despite a slight slowdown due to its sales tax being raised on April 1, the start of fiscal 1997/98.</p>
<p>Ogura said the United States is interested in seeing if Japan's economic recovery will continue, and if so, Washington would like to see growth that is led by domestic demand and not driven by exports.</p>
<p>On international financial matters, the G7 will discuss how to strengthen cooperation among central banks and finance ministries in their supervision of financial institutions, Ogura said.</p>
<p>Cooperation with rapidly developing countries is needed in an international effort to prevent the kind of financial problems that rocked Mexico in 1994/95, he said.</p>
<p>Ogura added that two separate statements may be issued at the end of the meetings -- one on economic matters by the G7 and another on political issues by the G7 plus Russia. ($1=116 yen)</p>
