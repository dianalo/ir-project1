<title>HUNGARY: Beverage shrs post gains on mixed Budapest bourse.</title>
<headline>Beverage shrs post gains on mixed Budapest bourse.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1996-12-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hungarian share prices closed mixed with gainers and losers roughly equally matched on the Budapest Stock Exchange on Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>Some of the recent gainers closed lower as investors decided to lock in profits after last week's gains, while other less liquid papers saw renewed demand for them.</p>
<p>The BUX index edged up 13.69 points to close at 3,714.68.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was rather balanced with minor fluctations,&quot; Geza Raner of Bank Austria-GiroCredit Rt, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some profit-taking will characterise the whole week but I don't think the bourse's performance would be bad this month.&quot;</p>
<p>Chemicals company TVK shares fell 30 forints to finish at 1,580 as certain investors decided to lock in profits after last week's surge to a new high of 1,640 forints.</p>
<p>&quot;There were signs already on Friday that the rally would not last long and today it reversed,&quot; Raner said. &quot;The paper deserves this price but it had risen too fast.&quot;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, TVK and pharmaceuticals company Richter still have buyers, although the selling side seems gradually turning stronger in both.</p>
<p>Richter closed at 8,815 forints, up 135, but below the day's peak of 8,900.</p>
<p>The beverage sector did well on Monday, partly because they have thin free float thus when an investor wants to buy a substantial share package, has to pay a premium, but also benefiting from the generally good January-September results, announced in November.</p>
<p>Brewery Sopron rose five percent to 2,520 forints, while liquer maker Zwack gained almost two percent to finish at 2,600.</p>
<p>The bourse's first mineral water company, Kekkuti Rt debuted with its price hovering between 1,315 and 1,355 forints, trading above its subscription price of 1,280 forints.</p>
