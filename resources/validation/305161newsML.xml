<p>Goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar began fixing soccer games for the benefit of an Asian gambling syndicate because he was bitter about how little he was paid by his club Liverpool, a British court heard on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Grobbelaar, once one of the game's top players who won five league titles for Liverpool, and two other soccer stars, Hans Segers and John Fashanu, denied all charges on the first day of their trial for match-fixing at Winchester in southern England.</p>
<p>It is the first case of its kind in England for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>Prosecutor David Calvert Smith said a witness, Chris Vincent, would tell the court later about a car trip he made with Grobbelaar to Manchester Airport on September 30, 1993.</p>
<p>Grobbelaar told Vincent he was going to meet some people from Asia. He was already advising them on how English soccer games would go, but was now discussing the possibility of going much further, and fixing games.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Grobbelaar) said he was embittered by the fact that Liverpool was not paying him enough, especially in comparison with newer players,&quot; Calvert Smith told the court.</p>
<p>Calvert Smith told the court Zimbabwean-born Grobbelaar received gross pay of 160,000 pounds ($267,600) from Liverpool in 1990/91 and a similar amount in 1993/94, but his wages were lower in the intervening seasons.</p>
<p>At the airport, Grobbelaar met Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim, the court heard. Lim is another defendant, accused with Grobbelaar, goalkeeper Segers and Fashanu of conspiring to give and accept payments in return for influencing the outcome of matches.</p>
<p>Vincent, according to Calvert Smith, saw Grobbelaar talk with Lim at a hotel bar, then enter a hotel lavatory with him.</p>
<p>&quot;When Mr Grobbelaar came back to Mr Vincent he had a package which he said contained 1,000 pounds from the Malaysian man for his information,&quot; Calvert Smith said. Grobbelaar later told Vincent he was going to be paid &quot;big bucks&quot; to fix games.</p>
<p>The case broke in November 1994 when the Sun newspaper, armed with accusations from Vincent, made match-rigging allegations against the goalkeeper, one of English soccer's most brilliant but eccentric players.</p>
<p>Calvert Smith said that although the jury might not have much sympathy for Vincent, who wanted to make money from the case and had only come forward after arguing with Grobbelaar, independent evidence fully backed his testimony.</p>
<p>Zimbabwean-born Grobbelaar is charged with taking 40,000 pounds to influence the outcome of the Liverpool game against Newcastle United in November 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Grobbelaar has admitted to the crime on tape and video, and was party to such an agreement,&quot; Calvert Smith said.</p>
<p>He said Segers -- who played for Wimbledon at the time -- paid large amounts of cash into the London branch of the Swiss affiliate of a New York bank on a number of occasions, each time shortly after his side had lost a match.</p>
<p>Segers told police that the money came from crimes he had committed when he was a teenager, but Calvert Smith dismissed the explanation as far-fetched.</p>
<p>Fashanu, his wife and Lim had all regularly received large amounts of money from the Far East which the prosecution would argue had been used to finance the match-rigging, he said.</p>
<p>The prosecutor said members of the jury might wonder how one player could alone ensure the result desired by gamblers.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, of course, he can't. He may not have the opportunity to do so,&quot; he said, noting that a keeper's defenders or the opposing team could foil his attempts.</p>
<p>&quot;Goalkeepers do make a mistake sometimes, so it may be that the odd deliberate mistake may escape attention,&quot; he added. Grobbelaar now plays for Plymouth in the second division. ($1=.5979 Pound)</p>
