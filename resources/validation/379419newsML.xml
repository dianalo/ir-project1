<title>UK: EU single market spurs UK investment surge - report.</title>
<headline>EU single market spurs UK investment surge - report.</headline>

<p>The European Union's single market programme has made the area the prime investment location for British companies, a report said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1994 and 1995 the value of British companies' assets in the EU outstripped their direct investments in North America for the first time,&quot; said the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).</p>
<p>In a report by economist Nigel Pain, it said the EU single market programme has been pivotal in the switch of investment location.</p>
<p>&quot;The NIESR research has established that a third of the total stock of UK foreign direct investment in the EU can be ascribed to the decison to create an internal market,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The report said a step up in direct investment was not expected when the programme was launched in the mid 1980s. &quot;The European Commission anticipated the main gains from removing internal non-tariff barriers would come via trade.&quot;</p>
<p>Having run at negligible levels during the early 1980s, UK firms' investment in the EU area rose to 20.6 billion pounds between 1986 and 1990 and to 32.6 billion stg from 1991 to 1995.</p>
<p>The changing pattern of investment was most pronounced in the service sector and financial services in particular. Within manufacturing, most direct investment was made in the chemicals and food, drink and tobacco industries.</p>
<p>The research found investment was diverted away from the U.S. during this period.</p>
