<title>USA: Washington attorney general sues teachers' union.</title>
<headline>Washington attorney general sues teachers' union.</headline>

<text>
<p>The state attorney general's office said on Wednesday it sued the Washington Education Association (WEA), alleging violations of the state's campaign finance law.</p>
<p>&quot;This suit seeks to enforce the law and bring WEA into compliance,&quot; Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Washington Education Association said it would respond in court to the charges.  </p>
<p>&quot;WEA has always done its best to follow the law in representing the interests of our members and of public education,&quot; Washington Education Association President C.T. Purdom said in a statement. &quot;The sooner this (suit) is resolved, the sooner we'll be able to focus all of our attention on improving public schools and improving the working lives of our 65,000 members.&quot;</p>
<p>The attorney general said the teachers' union was charged with failing to correctly report hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions, &quot;loans&quot; and expenditures that were allegedly used for political activities.  </p>
<p>In addition, the suit alleged that the association improperly collected and spent union dues to help finance its political-action committee.</p>
<p>The suit also charged that the association used its community outreach program as a second political-action committee without properly registering it with the Public Disclosure Commission.</p>
<p>According to the attorney general, the association improperly financed and failed to report $233,000 in contributions to campaigns to defeat charter schools and voucher initiatives.  </p>
<p>In 1992, voters in Washington state approved Initiative 134, which changed campaign finance disclosure rules.</p>
<p>The initiative prohibits the practice of using mandatory union payroll deductions for political activities without annual, written reauthorization from each union member.</p>
<p>Last December, the Washington Education Association went to Thurston County Superior Court, seeking a judgment that its community outreach program is not a political committee.</p>
<p>The attorney general's lawsuit was filed as a counterclaim to that action.</p>
