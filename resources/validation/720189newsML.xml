<p>The RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co., bowing to pressure from tobacco critics, including President (Bill) Clinton, said on Thursday it will replace its controversial Joe Camel advertising figure when it rolls out a new ad campaign this week.</p>
<p>The tobacco giant's new advertising campaign will appear on billboards nationally beginning this week and in magazines next month.</p>
<p>The new ads will feature the traditional trademarked camel that appears on every pack of the company's Camel brand of cigarettes. Joe Camel had been the primary marketing symbol for Camel since 1988.</p>
<p>RJ Reynolds also said it will phase out Joe Camel point-of-sale advertising at retail locations.</p>
<p>The move to pull Joe Camel comes just weeks after RJ Reynolds and other tobacco companies agreed to a $368.5 billion settlement with a coalition of states that are suing cigarette companies to recover the costs of treating smoking-related health problems.</p>
<p>In nine years as a marketing figure, Joe Camel has been the focus of tobacco critics' ire. They complained that the slick, colorful posters featuring the cartoon-like character appealed to children, encouraging them to take up smoking.</p>
<p>In a press release announcing the change, the company made no mention of the settlement or of other pressure to dump Joe Camel.</p>
<p>&quot;We are taking this new campaign nationally because of the very positive response we have heard from adult smokers who have seen some of the new ads that we have run in selected magazines since March,&quot; Fran Creighton, RJR's vice president of marketing for Camel, said in the press release.</p>
<p>A company spokesman did not immediately return phone calls.</p>
<p>The new ads -- featuring the slogan &quot;What You're Looking For&quot; -- were developed in early 1996 and RJR has been testing the advertising campaign for the past several months, it said.</p>
<p>The company's move to drop Joe Camel precedes government efforts -- expected in the wake of the tobacco settlement -- to ban the ads.</p>
