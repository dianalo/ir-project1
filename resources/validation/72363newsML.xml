<p>UK wheat futures drifted lower on Tuesday, mainly due to a lack of follow-through from buyers.</p>
<p>&quot;Buyers have stopped chasing the market and prices are drifting as a result,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Barley was also lower with traders forecasting only a limited amount of the barley for Saudi Arabia coming from the UK market.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't look as if the UK market is going to get as much of the Saudi tender as was first thought,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Others said the Saudi business had been built into prices over the past few days, so a downturn was only to be expected.</p>
<p>The result of the Saudi Arabian tender has yet to be confirmed but reports suggest it has bought 1.4 million tonnes of barley for import from October to December.</p>
<p>UK wheat futures closed 0.35 to 0.75 stg down after trading 400 lots while barley finished 0.25 to 0.50 stg lower on a turnover of 32 lots.</p>
<p>Amsterdam milling wheat futures were again neglected.</p>
<p>Cash trade in the UK was quiet with fob prices around 0.50 stg down while delivered market traders reported little activity.</p>
