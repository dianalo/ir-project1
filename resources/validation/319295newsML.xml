<title>FINLAND: FINLAND BANK SAYS STATE TO BUY CURRENCY DIRECTLY.</title>
<headline>FINLAND BANK SAYS STATE TO BUY CURRENCY DIRECTLY.</headline>
<dateline>HELSINKI 1997-01-20</dateline>

<p>Bank of Finland director Matti Vanhala said on Monday the Finnish state will with immediate effect start to buy foreign currency needed for debt servicing directly from the markets and no longer via the central bank.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will, for the time being, move to a system whereby the state will buy the currencies it needs for amortisation and interest expenses (on the foreign currency denominated state debt) directly from the markets, not via us, as it has been until now,&quot; Vanhala told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>He said the amounts at stake would be &quot;a couple of tens of billions of markka&quot;. Currency purchases by the state would &quot;not occur frequently, but it will be big amounts each time,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It means that some tens of billions (of markka) will appear on the other side of the demand and supply balance on the foreign exchange market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under the previous system, the central bank would be buying currency on the market and selling it to the state for debt servicing purposes.</p>
<p>Vanhala indicated that this system would be changed in the light of the markka's recent sharp appreciation.</p>
<p>&quot;When it happens (the state buys currency) it will be relatively big amounts, and on a thin market this is something that people should be aware of,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Until now, we have taken care of it as a transaction between the Bank of Finland and the state and this is also natural on a market that is relatively stable,&quot; Vanhala said.</p>
<p>&quot;But now that we have had such a one-sided market we think it is natural that we let this part of the equation go via the pricing of the market,&quot; he added.</p>
