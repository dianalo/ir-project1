<p>Singapore's delicate racial sensitivities have been exposed in the campaign for Thursday's election as the ruling party turned its guns on a &quot;Chinese chauvinist&quot; opposition candidate.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has called Tang Liang Hong of the Workers' Party (WP) a &quot;dangerous character&quot; whose views threaten Singapore's hard-earned racial harmony.</p>
<p>Singapore has been deeply sensitive over the issue since bloody racial riots in 1964, and communal tensions were an important factor in Singapore's 1965 separation from its northern neighbour Malaysia.</p>
<p>The Chinese community is the largest component of Singapore society with 77.4 percent of the population, but there are also significant minorities of Malays (14.2 percent) and Indians (7.2 percent). Other ethnic groups make up the balance of 1.2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that Chinese chauvinism should be beyond the spectrum of multi-racial politics,&quot; said lawyer Simon Tay.</p>
<p>Political scientist Shee Poon Kim said the issues would shape the kind of society Singaporeans want in the next century, even though chauvinism would never be eliminated.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very difficult issue of nation building -- how to build a balanced and stable political system which can satisfy not only the economic needs but also political, cultural and maybe spiritual needs of a multi-racial society.&quot;</p>
<p>Goh put his prestige on the line in his attempt to keep Tang out of parliament, telling voters the issue was a key one in an election his People's Action Party (PAP) had won before a vote was cast.</p>
<p>Goh alleged Tang told a seminar more than two years ago that Chinese-educated Singaporeans &quot;were carrying the sedan chair for others&quot; when they &quot;should be sitting on the sedan chair&quot;.</p>
<p>Goh has also accused Tang of complaining there were too many Christians and English-educated ministers and senior bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Tang denies being a chauvinist. What he wanted, he told a news conference, was for the government to use Mandarin more to help the &quot;silent majority&quot; of Chinese-speaking Singaporeans.</p>
<p>Workers' Party leader Joshua Jeyaretnam told a campaign rally the PAP had nothing to worry about because Tang would be thrown out of the party if he were a chauvinist and an anti-Christian.</p>
<p>Goh called Tang an extremist and said his views could threaten harmony in Singapore.</p>
<p>&quot;We have gone through this period even with bloodshed as far as chauvinism is concerned, whether it's Malay or Chinese chauvinism,&quot; said Zainul Abidin Rasheed, one of five PAP candidates facing Tang and his slate in multi-member Cheng San constituency.</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever anybody tends to raise its ugly head again we must nip it in the bud before it becomes a bigger problem and this was precisely being done,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Laws prevent Singaporeans from criticising each other's culture or religion and forbid religious missionaries from actively trying to convert people.</p>
<p>To prevent the build-up of racial enclaves, the government introduced a policy in 1989 which caps the number of residents from certain ethnic groups in the same block in public flats.</p>
<p>Minority representation in parliament was guaranteed in 1988 with the creation of multi-member constituencies, where at least one member must be from a minority group.</p>
<p>Singapore has also made English the working language to create &quot;a level playing field&quot;, with Malay, Chinese and Tamil as official languages.</p>
<p>In the campaign, Goh and Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew stressed the importance of English as the working language despite the growing importance of Mandarin as China emerges as a regional economic and political power.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very dangerous view to say that Singapore must have Chinese as the dominant language,&quot; Goh said. &quot;This will cause problems for our Malay friends and Indian friends, also for Singapore in Southeast Asia.&quot;</p>
<p>If Singapore made Chinese the main working language, neighbours -- ethnically Malay-dominated Indonesia and Malaysia -- would suspect it of being a potential base for a growing China, Goh said.</p>
<p>Tay said the position of Singapore's Malay community was of particular importance despite its small number. &quot;Historically, the constitution recognise them as the indigenous people of Singapore and in light of its geopolitical dimension, being surrounded by the Malay world.&quot;</p>
<p>He said since the 1991 elections, the government has tried to reach out to the Chinese-educated. &quot;Now that Tang is telling them that is not enough, perhaps it's time to say no, because each sector will have its own demand.&quot;</p>
