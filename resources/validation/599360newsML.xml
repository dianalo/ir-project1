<p>-----------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - May 20---------------</p>
<p>Gold is expected to hold above $340.00 an ounce in European trading on Tuesday, though it will struggle to make significant gains after recent stop loss and investment fund selling, traders and chartists said.</p>
<p>Silver is expected to bounce, while platinum is likely to be locked in a sideways trading pattern, they added.  </p>
<p>GOLD - Despite stop loss and investment fund selling over the past few days gold is likely to find support at $340.00 an ounce on Tuesday and could even turn to test slightly higher levels.</p>
<p>Karen Jones of Credit Suisse First Boston said gold should find good underlying support between $340.00 and $338.00, while she was pegging $345 as a stiff upside barrier.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold is due for a bounce, though any upside gains will be limited,&quot; Jones commented.</p>
<p>Other market operators agreed saying that they believed that the selling that has recently rocked the market is all but over. &quot;We have tested $340.00 which has held...some buying is creeping back in,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>On the charts resistance is likely to be found from the 10- and 30-day moving averages at around $344.92 and $343.38, analysts said.</p>
<p>At 0735 GMT spot gold was quoted at $342.10/342.60, versus London's Monday close of $341.00/341.50.</p>
