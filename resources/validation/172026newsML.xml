<headline>SOCCER-SCOTS AGREE TO FIFA DECISION, ESTONIANS DELIGHTED.</headline>
<dateline>GLASGOW, Scotland 1996-11-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Scottish officials have agreed to abide by the FIFA ruling that their World Cup qualifier with Estonia should be replayed, while their Estonian counterparts said they were &quot;delighted&quot; by the decision.</p>
<p>Scottish Football Association chief executive Jim Farry said Scotland would go back to Tallinn, but they were seeking clarification on a number of issues.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me make it clear that we will abide by this decision by FIFA,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However officials are concerned about the weather and the floodlight conditions in Estonia for any rematch of the group four fixture which has to be played by March 16. </p>
<p>The match had previously been awarded to Scotland after Estonia failed to turn up for the tie on October 9. The referee blew the final whistle just three seconds after the match, and Scotland were awarded a 3-0 win.</p>
<p>&quot;My view is that there will be a major difficulty in arranging this match in the timescale set,&quot; Farry said. &quot;There is the possibility of an international date in December and one in February, but much could depend on the weather conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are delighted with this decision,&quot; Aenar Lepponen, Estonian Football Federation's Secretary General, said. &quot;If the weather conditions are bad, the game could be held in a neutral country like Cyprus,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The October 9 match ended in farce after Scottish coach Craig Brown complained that the floodlighting was the worst he had ever seen and asked FIFA to rule on an ealier start time.</p>
<p>The Scottish team lined up for the game at the new time but the Estonians, who said they heard of the final decision too late to get their team to the stadium, failed to show.</p>
<p>Scotland manager Craig Brown supported Farry, saying: &quot;We'd have played Estonia at 10 am, 3 pm or midnight. We will abide by this decision. It's up to others to decide if it's fair.&quot;</p>
<p>But captain Gary McAllister of Coventry City, whose one-match ban will now be served when Scotland play Sweden in Sunday's qualifier in Glasgow, was disappointed that he had been ruled out of Sunday's game.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought the game I was going to miss was Estonia rather than the Swedish one, which I think will be a very important match in the group,&quot; he said.</p>
