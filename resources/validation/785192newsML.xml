<title>USA: COALITION SEEKS TO STOP PROTECTION OF US UTILITIES.</title>
<headline>COALITION SEEKS TO STOP PROTECTION OF US UTILITIES.</headline>

<p>An odd coalition of free market, consumer and green groups Thursday launched a campaign to stop state regulators and the U.S. government from saving lumbering utilities in the move to an open power market.</p>
<p>The groups acknowledged they were getting into the game late, but said states that are deregulating utility monopolies should not protect uncompetitive companies by allowing them to recover so-called stranded costs as their customers shift to other power suppliers.</p>
<p>&quot;A consumer bailout of these poorly-managed utilities is phony competition,&quot; Anna Aurelio, staff scientist for U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Utilities and analysts have estimated the whole industry's stranded costs -- the value of assets that might become unprofitable in an open market -- at $200 billion.</p>
<p>Consumer groups fear that utilities' captive customers, residential power consumers, will end up covering those costs in their rates, while bigger customers who move to other suppliers and utility shareholders get off the hook.</p>
<p>California's state government voted to allow utilites to recover $28 billion in stranded costs, which regulators must now approve before the state opens its market in 1998, said Scott Denman, executive director of the anti-nuclear group Safe Energy Communication Council.</p>
<p>The eight groups in the coalition, ranging from the arch-conservative Heritage Foundation to the environmental group Friends of the Earth, said the powerful utilities and big manufacturers had dominated the electric deregulation debate, while residential consumers had not been heard.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like going up against Moby Dick with a rowboat and tartar sauce,&quot; said Crews. The groups said they will be working separately to educate consumers about the potential costs that might hit them.</p>
<p>Consumer groups in California, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, the states moving most rapidly toward open power markets, have begun battling the states' plans to allow utilities to recover their stranded costs.</p>
<p>The Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities, said that other industries that had been deregulated, including railroads, arilines and natural gas, had been protected in the transition to competition.</p>
<p>The association pointed to regulators' statements that it would be unfair to break up monopolies without protecting investments that they made under the old rules of regulated markets.</p>
