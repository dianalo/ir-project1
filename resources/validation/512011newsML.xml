<title>FRANCE: World's big TV stations losing audience - study.</title>
<headline>World's big TV stations losing audience - study.</headline>
<dateline>CANNES, France 1997-04-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>The world's major television stations are having difficulty holding on to their audiences because viewers have more choice to hop to other channels, according to a study published at the MIP television trade fair in Cannes.</p>
<p>The study, by Eurodata TV, part of French media-watching group Mediametrie, said last year that in general, the amount of television people watched every day was on the increase everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>However, &quot;in 1996 the best-established channels all had difficulty in holding on to their lead... they all saw their market share eroded,&quot; said the study released on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;In the United States, the networks now command only two thirds of the audience. This type of situation also exists in Germany, where the leading channel, RTL, has 17 percent of the audience, and all its challengers have under 15 percent,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Despite rises in market share of public channels in France, Finland and Britain last year, in most countries their share continues to fall,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>In Spain, Italy, Turkey and Greece people watch more television than in the Scandinavian countries, Belgium and the Netherlands, it said.</p>
<p>The top score for television watching was won by Poland, with an average of four hours and three minutes per day per person, while France, hosting the television trade fair, took 11th place with two hours and 59 minutes per person per day.</p>
