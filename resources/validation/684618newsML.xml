<p>Hong Kong's status as a trading conduit into China is unlikely to change with the colony's reversion to Chinese rule in a week's time, traders and analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is the world's seventh largest trading post, principally because it is a window on to the enormous Chinese market, the experts said.</p>
<p>And when 156 years of British colonial rule come to an end at midnight on June 30, little is expected to change in that respect, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We think Hong Kong will remain very important for China's trade, in large part because it has the trading infrastructure,&quot; John Cairns, communications officer with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), said.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously, ports are developing all along China's coast, so it may be that in percentage terms China will trade more directly with the world,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But as China does more trade overall, the absolute numbers handled by Hong Kong may well continue to increase,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In 1996, two-way trade between Hong Kong and China totalled $134.6 billion, accounting for 35.8 percent of Hong Kong's total external trade, and making China Hong Kong's largest trading partner, HKTDC figures show.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is China's second largest trading partner after Japan, with Chinese customs figures showing bilateral trade, including re-exports, in the first four months of 1997 totalling $14.1 billion.</p>
<p>About 80 percent of Hong Kong's manufacturers have production facilities in China, the HKTDC says, and some 80 percent of the imports and exports of Guangdong province -- where China's export-oriented industry is based -- are handled by the port and airport of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>As China's market of 1.2 billion people becomes more sophisticated, it will develop into distinctive segments that will be served by different centres, the experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's more than one market here in China. Although we tend to refer to it as 'the China market' that's probably not very accurate,&quot; John Crossman, general manager of Jardine Fleming Securities in Shanghai, said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong would long continue to serve southern China, he said. &quot;Then there's central China, which is going to be served by Shanghai, and northern China which will be served by Beijing and Tianjin,&quot; Crossman said.</p>
<p>Indeed, many trading and trade-related organisations had already begun to differentiate in this manner.</p>
<p>International commodity trading houses that already have offices in Hong Kong and Singapore are opening offices in China, either to service joint venture operations or to keep an eye on the market while they await the day they can participate in trade and distribution here.</p>
<p>&quot;In the future there will be some companies that move to the mainland but the main reason for that won't be any change in the status of Hong Kong, it will be the cost of operating in Hong Kong,&quot; John Howard, general manager of Inspectorate (Shanghai) Ltd, said.</p>
<p>Inspectorate, a London-based commodity inspection and analysis firm, opened its Shanghai office last week, and plans to open one soon in the northern port of Dalian and one in southern Guangzhou in 1998, he said. It already has a Hong Kong office.</p>
<p>&quot;Going further down the line, in five or six years time, I would expect cities like Shanghai will be more attractive locations, not from a cost point of view but because there will be more direct trading,&quot; Howard said.</p>
<p>None of the experts polled by Reuters mentioned Beijing's promise to retain Hong Kong's capitalist style of government for the next 50 years as a factor in its future status as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China.</p>
<p>&quot;No change for 50 years is a slogan, it's not a legal guarantee of anything,&quot; Crossman of Jardine Fleming said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a customs regime would continue to exist between the two, he and others said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think bringing something into Hong Kong means that it is already in China -- that will be a big issue, you'll still have to pay the tax when you want to bring it into China. Hong Kong will be like a Chinese bonded area,&quot; Crossman said.</p>
