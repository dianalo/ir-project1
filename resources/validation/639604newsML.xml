<p>The Czech finance ministry said on Thursday that it had submitted a plan to the government to privatise remaining state shares in three of the four largest domestic banks, seeking a strong &quot;strategic&quot; partner for two of them.</p>
<p>In a statement, the ministry said that it would seek a strategic, which has often meant a foreign, partner to take stakes in Komercni Banka a.s. and Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s. (CSOB).  </p>
<p>&quot;It is expected that (with) both CSOB and Komercni Banka that a method of privatisation will be chosen which will allow for the participation of a strong strategic investor in these banks and which at the same time will bring maximum revenue from the sale of the state shares...&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>It added that the partner should &quot;provide the banks with the prospect of strengthening of their position on the market.&quot;</p>
<p>It said that the Czech National Bank, which has authority over all commercial banks, had agreed with the ministry's plan.</p>
<p>The proposal calls for the state's stakes in both CSOB and Komercni to be privatised this year with the process to begin immediately after final government approval.</p>
<p>It also plans for the privatisation of the largest savings bank, Ceska Sporitelna, in 1998. The ministry did not say what method of privatisation would be used in the case of Sporitelna.  </p>
<p>The sale of the state's roughly one-third stake in the third largest bank, Investicni a Postovni Banka a.s. (IPB), through a tender, is expected to be completed soon.</p>
<p>Nomura Intl and Dutch ING Bank NV, have been chosen as finalists in the IPB tender conducted by Salomon Brothers. The Czech government had declared it wanted a &quot;strategic&quot; investor in the IPB tender as well.</p>
<p>The Czech state-run National Property Fund (FNM) holds 49 percent of Komercni Banka, the largest commercial bank, while various Czech state agencies hold a roughly two-thirds stake in CSOB. The remainder is held by Slovak state institutions.</p>
<p>The Czech NPF also holds a 45 percent equity stake in Sporitelna, but 51 percent of the voting rights.</p>
<p>The finance ministry announcement effectively puts to rest a central bank proposal suggested late last year for a &quot;mega-merger&quot; of CSOB and Sporitelna which would have created the largest bank in the region.</p>
