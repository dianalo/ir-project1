<title>USA: NY physical coffee - spot differentials firm.</title>
<headline>NY physical coffee - spot differentials firm.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Producers held the upper hand on the New York physical coffee market this week, as roasters were forced to contend with rising differentials as well as higher prices on the futures market, traders said.</p>
<p>Low levels of consumer coffee stocks, coupled with chilly temperatures in the U.S. and Europe, kept prompt supplies tight, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;Roasters are buying as they need to just to fill holes, but they do not have big inventories,&quot; one trader said. &quot;And the cold weather accentuates consumption.&quot;  </p>
<p>Traders said keen competition from European and Asian roasters and a pick up in local demand, sparked higher differentials this week on the spot Brazilian market.</p>
<p>&quot;There is good interest in Brazils from Japan and Europe,&quot; a trader said. &quot;And local roasters are paying good prices.&quot;</p>
<p>Spot Santos 4s were offered at two cents under CSCE March, up some two cents from last week. Fine cup Santos 2/3s, heard around even a week ago, fetched four cents over &quot;C&quot;.</p>
<p>In Colombia, a dockers strike in the main Pacific port of Buenaventura threatened to push already hefty differentials higher.</p>
