<p>Higher oil prices in 1996 pushed Saudi Arabia's revenues some $12 billion over projections and enabled the kingdom to catch up on debt payments, but economists said on Tuesday the 1997 budget was still a conservative one.</p>
<p>Released late on Monday, the budget projected a deficit of 17 billion riyals ($4.5 billion) for 1997 -- steady at the actual 1996 deficit, but below the 18.5 billion spending-revenue gap forecast for the year last January.</p>
<p>&quot;It's steady as it goes,&quot; said a Western commercial attache.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks more or less as expected -- conservative,&quot; an economist told Reuters by telephone from Riyadh.</p>
<p>&quot;Three percent is acceptable even by the standards of the (industrialised) OECD countries, since they had an average of 3.4 percent in the 1980s,&quot; leading Saudi economist Ihsan Bu-Hulaiga said in reference to the 1996 deficit to GDP ratio.</p>
<p>Economists said stronger oil prices -- which in 1996 shot up to their highest level since the 1990-91 Gulf War -- were behind the rise in the world's largest oil producer and exporter's earnings in 1996 to 177 billion riyals compared to a forecast 131.5 billion.</p>
<p>This gave the kingdom the ammunition to wipe out 22 billion riyals in arrears, 15 billion to contractors and suppliers and the rest to farmers, which had been building up since the war.</p>
<p>A barrel of Saudi Arabia's six million barrels per day of crude exports on Tuesday was around $22.00, compared to around $14 on which the 1996 and 1997 budgets are thought to be based.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is genuine in really easing the domestic debt situation. In 1997 if oil prices stay strong we are likely to see more and more of these payments,&quot; Bu-Hulaiga said.</p>
<p>Economists could not say how much was still owing.</p>
<p>Spending for the new year was capped at 181 billion riyals -- 13 billion below the actual 1996 figure, indicating the kingdom's drive to slowly lessen state dominance in the economy.</p>
<p>Economists said this was the first time the government had given figures for actual income and expenditure for the previous year, a move seen as part of its efforts to improve disclosure.</p>
<p>The bumper oil earnings were also clearly reflected on the current account of the balance of payments, which posted a surplus for the first time in years. A 700 million riyal surplus was announced, after a deficit of 19.9 billion riyals in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;This is good news and credible and the first surplus in years, but this is still an estimate and current account figures by their nature vary,&quot; warned a Western diplomat.</p>
<p>&quot;For more than 13 years the current account deficit has haunted the economy,&quot; Bu-Hulaiga said. &quot;This is the biggest achievement. Even the most optimistic forecasts expected the deficit would be reduced only by about two-thirds.&quot;</p>
<p>The finance ministry said growth picked up in 1996, with the economy expanding 8.6 percent at current prices to 510 billion riyals after 4.3 percent growth in 1995 and 1.4 percent in 1994. Inflation remained subdued, at below one percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The overall performance of 8.6 percent nominal growth is very impressive by any standards and contributes directly to achieving the goals of the sixth five-year development plan,&quot; Bu-Hulaiga said. The plan to 2000 forecasts average annual real growth of 3.8 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall the level of growth is truly remarkable,&quot; said Anzar Ahmad, vice president of the Consulting Center for Finance and Investment in Riyadh.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing that is quite striking is the high percentage of spending on education -- 41.7 billion riyals -- almost a quarter of the budget. This brings to the fore the emphasis on developing appropriate manpower,&quot; Ahmad added.</p>
<p>One of the concerns of the government is to ensure that young Saudis have the right skills to replace foreign labour.</p>
<p>&quot;This is characteristic of the current trend of increasing the contribution of the local workforce in the national workforce. Of each three working people, two are expats and one is a Saudi. This is totally unacceptable especially when private transfers in 1995 were about $17.6 billion,&quot; Bu-Hulaiga said.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, where about six million of the population of 18 million are expatriates, is trying to cut down on foreign labour and find more jobs for its nationals. Analysts say that less than seven percent of private sector employees are Saudi.</p>
