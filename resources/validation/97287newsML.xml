<p>Holding company CGIP will not be able to sign an agreement to buy a 28 percent stake in car parts maker Valeo from Cerus before the end of the month, a CGIP spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>The French financial newspaper La Tribune on Friday reported speculation that CGIP had signed an agreement on Thursday to buy the stake for 300 francs per share.</p>
<p>The spokesman said there could only be an agreement on Valeo once CGIP had raised the necessary financing, which, as the company has said before, would occur when it sold half its 20 percent stake in Crown Cork &amp; Seal.</p>
<p>This would happen by the end of October if all went to plan, he said. He declined to confirm the price reported, but said the price usually fell somewhere between the market price and what the seller was demanding.</p>
<p>Valeo shares were at 285.90 francs, down 7.80 francs, in late trading on the bourse. Cerus, the holding company of Italian businessman Carlo De Benedetti earlier this year said it expected a price that would take into account its estimation that Valeo's stock would be worth around 400 francs in a couple of years.</p>
<p>CGIP's board agreed on September 26 to try to conclude the purchase of Cerus's stake in Valeo and finance it by selling 10 percent of Crown Cork, providing a &quot;French solution&quot; to the future of Valeo.</p>
