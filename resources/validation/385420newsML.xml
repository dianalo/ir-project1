<title>USA: WMX CEO Phillip Rooney resigns.</title>
<headline>WMX CEO Phillip Rooney resigns.</headline>
<dateline>OAK BROOK, Ill. 1997-02-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>WMX Technologies Inc., the nation's largest garbage hauling company, Tuesday announced the resignation of its president and chief executive, Phillip Rooney.</p>
<p>An investment fund controlled by financier George Soros last week called for the outster of Rooney, who had headed WMX only since June 1996.</p>
<p>The Soros group and other large shareholders of WMX have been pressing the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company for months to improve its performance and make major changes.</p>
<p>Chairman Dean Buntrock will serve as acting chief executive while WMX searches for a new CEO from outside the company, it said.</p>
<p>WMX said Rooney also gave up his seat on the boards of directors of WMX and its Wheelabrator Technologies Inc. and Waste Management International Plc affiliates.</p>
<p>&quot;Phil Rooney was the architect of the plan to focus on our core competencies in waste management and waste-to-energy services, a plan that the board strongly, unanimously and enthusiastically endorses,&quot; said WMX Director Peer Pedersen.</p>
<p>&quot;We accepted his resignation reluctantly and only because he was determined that our people should not be distracted from the important tasks at hand. While we regret Phil's departure, the board thanks him for putting the company on a firm strategic path.&quot;</p>
<p>WMX said it is also continuing its search for two new independent directors with major corporate experience.</p>
<p>WMX's stock rose $1.625 to $34.50 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading.</p>
