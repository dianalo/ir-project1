<p>The resignation of former assistant treasurer Jim Short has produced the worst possible outcome for the Liberal-National government from his unwise ownership of bank shares.</p>
<p>The government could not have suffered more damage from this modest-sized issue if it had tried. Worse, it gave up a chance to pick up some points from it last week.</p>
<p>The Labor Opposition first twigged on Wednesday to Short's ownership of bank shares, which was in conflict with his banking responsibilities within the treasury portfolio.</p>
<p>Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, probably mistakenly, dealt with the issue quite softly on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Labor sources say the opposition was not sure Short's declaration, in the register of senators interests, was was up to date.</p>
<p>As a result of this Howard could have sacked Short on Wednesday night and actually strengthened the government.</p>
<p>The action would have made him look strong in the most desirable of all subjects: propriety.</p>
<p>The Opposition, having barely raised the issue at that point, could not have claimed the scalp.</p>
<p>Also, Short was no star performer. Letting him go would have been an opportunity to promote a more promising backbencher into a trainee ministerial position.</p>
<p>Instead the prime minister decided to retain the minister, a long-time friend, and absorb the short-term political damage that would innevitably follow.</p>
<p>Howard made it worse for himself by telling parliament on Wednesday that he seriously considered dumping Short but had decided against it. It amounted to saying &quot;I squibbed it.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, Short's resignation -- after his office discovered he had made a ministerial decision relevant to the shares -- means that the political pain was for nothing.</p>
<p>The government has lost the minister and worse, highlighted how wrong was the original decision not to dismiss him.</p>
