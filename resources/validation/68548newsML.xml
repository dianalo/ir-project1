<p>Jockey Stephen Craine enjoyed his first classic success at the age of 39 when he guided Oscar Schindler (4-1) to an impressive victory in the group one Irish St Leger on Saturday.</p>
<p>Irish champion Johnny Murtagh had pushed the 11-4 favourite Key Change past the tiring pace-setter Blushing Flame as the nine-runner field turned for home.</p>
<p>But Oscar Schindler, a Royal Ascot winner, was going ominously well and a devastating turn of speed inside the final furlong (200 metres) saw the Kevin Prendergast-trained colt home by an easy three-and-a-half lengths.</p>
<p>Michael Stoute's 9-2 chance, Sacrament, finished best of the three British challengers in third spot a further two lengths adrift.  </p>
<p>Oscar Schindler was third in the 1995 Irish Leger and fourth in this year's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot where he was squeezed for room.</p>
<p>Craine rated Saturday's win the proudest moment of his career. His previous major success dates back to 1992 when he rode Irish Derby winner St Jovite to victory in Ascot's King George.</p>
<p>It was a third Irish Leger success for Curragh-based trainer Prendergast.</p>
<p>Oscar Schindler will now drop back two furlongs (400 metres) in distance from Saturday's 14-furlongs (2.8 km) to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris on October 6.</p>
<p>&quot;Oscar Schindler is getting better...he is growing into his huge frame,&quot; said Prendergast.</p>
<p>&quot;I was confident all week that he would win,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Murtagh said that his mount had been beaten by the better horse on the day.</p>
<p>&quot;We gave it everything...but we couldn't match the winner's pace in the end,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Just over 40 minutes later top Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien landed his first group one race when 11-1 chance Desert King, the mount of British jockey Walter Swinburn, won the Aga Khan Stud National Stakes run over seven furlongs (1.4 km).</p>
