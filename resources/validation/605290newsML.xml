<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan activists plan fresh anti-government march.</title>

<p>Taiwan activists pledged on Thursday to mount a third mass protest to denounce President Lee Teng-hui's government, saying it had failed to heed calls to improve social order.</p>
<p>Officials criticised the plan, saying further protests were unnecessary because the government had clearly understood what the protesters wanted and would take action.</p>
<p>More than 50,000 people marched on the Presidential Office on May 4 and again on May 18 to vent anger at investigators' failure to solve a string of murders that have fuelled feelings that social order was declining.</p>
<p>The marches have been seen by analysts as indications of a loss of public confidence in President Lee's Nationalist government.</p>
<p>Protest organiser Lee Tien-chien of the Humanistic Education Foundation said the planned May 24 march would run through the night and voice &quot;utmost discontent&quot; with Lee's policies.</p>
<p>&quot;We are totally disappointed with the government and no longer expect it to do anything,&quot; Lee Tien-chien said, adding that officials had turned a deaf ear to the earlier protests.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite our demand, Lee Teng-hui failed to acknowledge his mistakes or immediately replace the premier,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Government spokesman David Lee said further protests were a waste since Taiwan's leaders had heard the demonstrators' message.</p>
<p>David Lee said cabinet chief or Premier Lien Chan had addressed many issues publicly.</p>
<p>Lien and his cabinet have faced criticism over numerous unsolved crimes, including the gangland-style execution of a county magistrate and seven associates in his home and the kidnap-murder of the daughter of a prominent actress.</p>
<p>To reduce public discontent and help restore public confidence in government, Lien offered to give up the premiership after constitutional reforms are adopted in July.</p>
