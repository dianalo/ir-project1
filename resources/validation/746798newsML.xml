<p>Austria's ATX index rebounded on Tuesday to end moderately firmer and traders saw potential upside to 1,470 points, provided the market could break through resistance at 1,440.</p>
<p>&quot;It was still a bit disappointing when you look at what the other markets did,&quot; said one trader. &quot;It's noticeable that the future is constantly eight to 10 points above the cash market,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Traders said they did not expect any major correction, only mild consolidation.</p>
<p>&quot;We should see 1,440 this week, or at least at the beginning of next week,&quot; one trader said, predicting the index would test the previous high of 1,470.</p>
<p>&quot;At 1,440 we will either turn back or surge to 1,470,&quot; he noted.</p>
<p>Dealers did not expect any negative impact from U.S. Fed Greenspan's testimony. &quot;In the U.S. they are concentrating mainly on business results and we have had almost nothing negative recently,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>The ATX index edged up 0.59 percent to 1,408.44. Of its constituents 15 shares rose and six fell.</p>
<p>The top gainer was Lenzing, jumping 4.36 percent or 34 schillings to 814 schillings on continued demand from Monday's news a U.S. court ruled in its favour in a patent dispute with UK chemicals group Courtaulds Plc and confirmed Lenzing's patent in the U.S.</p>
<p>Insurer EA Generali led the decliners, dropping 75 schillings to 3,455.</p>
<p>The August ATX future added 17 points to 1,416 on turnover of 868 contracts.</p>
