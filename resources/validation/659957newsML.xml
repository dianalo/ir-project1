<p>Soldiers killed at least seven separatist militants in two clashes in northeast India, and insurgents killed one paramilitary soldier in a third attack, police and army officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Four tribal guerrillas of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland were killed by soldiers at Mokokchung town in the mountainous state of Nagaland near the Burmese border, authorities said.</p>
<p>Troops killed at least three insurgents, including a woman, of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) in Borthekerabari village in the tea- and oil-rich state of Assam.</p>
<p>Soldiers recovered large quantities of arms and explosives in both incidents, which occurred on Thursday, officials said.</p>
<p>In a separate attack by insurgents on a paramilitary camp, separatist guerrillas killed one soldier and wounded six, four of them seriously, authorities said.</p>
<p>They said rebels belonging to the separatist United National Liberation Front (UNLF) opened fire on the camp late on Thursday in the heavily wooded state of Manipur, which borders Burma.</p>
<p>It was the UNLF's second major attack on a paramilitary camp in the past week. The rebels killed seven soldiers on Monday.</p>
<p>India's northeastern region, comprising seven states with more than 200 ethnic groups and rich in minerals and timber, has been racked by separatist violence for decades.</p>
<p>The region is surrounded by Burma, Bangladesh, Bhutan and China, and linked to the rest of India by a 20-km (12-mile) wide corridor in the eastern state of West Bengal.</p>
<p>Political parties led by Assam's ruling Asom Gana Parishad launched a 10-hour general strike on Friday to protest against an attempt by militants last Sunday to kill the chief minister, Prafulla Kumar Mahanta.</p>
<p>Suspected ULFA guerrillas set off a bomb on a road minutes after Mahanta's vehicle had passed by.</p>
<p>&quot;There is total response to the strike,&quot; a senior government official in the Assam capital Guwahati said. &quot;All business establishments are closed and vehicles are off the road all over the state.&quot;</p>
