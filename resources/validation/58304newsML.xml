<p>Gippsland Resources Australia NL chairman John Telford said on Tuesday he was hopeful that his company would win the rights to develop the 40-tonne primary gold deposit at Boroo, Mongolia.</p>
<p>&quot;We are hopeful about the outcome of the tender,&quot; Telford said in an address to the Asia Gold Congress currently being held in Hong Kong, adding that a decision was expected soon.</p>
<p>Mongolia's Mining Division director at the Ministry of Agriculture and Industry, Tsendiin Enkhbold, who was unable to attend the Congress at the last minute, requested Telford to present his speech.</p>
<p>According to Enkhbold, US firm Morrison Knedsen had also prepared a feasibility study to develop the Boroo primary deposit.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, Australian company Molopo Australia is working for confirmation of the Tsagaan Suvrag copper deposit reserves,&quot; Enkhbold added, noting that the copper deposit had a high gold content.</p>
<p>Three foreign companies from Russia and Canada were working to develop primary deposits in Mongolia, Enkhbold said.</p>
<p>He listed Mongolrostsvetmet, a Mongol-Russian joint venture at Eroo and Zamar, Canada's Mongolia Gold Co. Ltd at the Bumbat primary deposit and the Russian Yakutalmaz Co. Ltd at the Tavt vein deposit.</p>
<p>Mongolia Gold Resources Inc announced in June it would invest US$600,000 to develop the Bumbat mine and that construction was on schedule.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition to that we have started detailed exploration work in Tsagaan Tsakhir primary deposit with the assistance of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA),&quot; Enkhbold said.</p>
<p>He added that RTZ-CRA was gathering information and conducting field studies in six areas of western and central Mongolia.</p>
<p>&quot;Just recently the Australian mining company BHP has opened its representative office in Ulaanbaatar and applied to conduct copper exploration,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mongolia's newly elected democratic government is encouraging foreign investment in minerals to jump start economic growth, Enkhbold said.</p>
