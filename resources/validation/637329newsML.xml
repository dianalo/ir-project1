<p>New French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, having promised a break with obsessive economic austerity and an accountant's view of Europe, is under considerable trade union pressure to deliver.</p>
<p>Socialist Jospin can probably count on a warmer start to relations than the previous government.</p>
<p>But union leaders are already seeking wage rises, a rethink on privatisation and reassurances that he will stop turning the screws on public spending in the name of European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>One high-profile national union leader, Force Ouvriere (FO) chief Marc Blondel, says his most urgent priority is getting Jospin to confirm that France will push for a less stringent qualification test for the single euro currency.</p>
<p>Blondel wants to avoid more public spending cutbacks that would hit the social security system. He also dislikes the &quot;stability pact&quot; on the control of budget deficits in the wake of the planned 1999 EMU launch.</p>
<p>Even if Blondel is fighting a personal campaign on the social security front, his desire to keep Jospin to his word of a shift in emphasis on EMU is shared by others, including the more moderate white-collar CGC union.</p>
<p>CGC chief Marc Vilbenoit says monetary union needs more of a social dimension and less obsession with curbing public deficits to precisely three percent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>Several union leaders have made it clear they are not under any illusion about the prospects for rapid progress on Socialist promises of 700,000 jobs and a move to a shorter 35-hour working week within three years.</p>
<p>More pressing issues will be the SMIC national minimum wage, civil service wage increases and privatisations planned by the centre-right before it lost Sunday's parliamentary election.</p>
<p>The Communist-led CGT union has demanded an immediate rise in the minimum wage beyond the automatic indexed increase which takes place in July.</p>
<p>The Communist Party has the same line and will get some posts in the Socialist-dominated coalition but is not expected to have the muscle to hold Jospin hostage.</p>
<p>Socialist Elizabeth Guigou has said her party wants to give the minimum wage a lift from 37.91 francs ($6.50) per hour, or 6,406.79 francs a month, currently.</p>
<p>Blondel's Force Ouvriere argues that SMIC-earners in textiles and other low-wage sectors get relief on social security charges and that boosting the SMIC could at best exacerbate this problem.</p>
<p>Civil service pay is another nettle that Jospin's team will have to grasp after universal union rejection in February of a 2.8 percent pay rise over 1997-98 which was imposed by former civil service minister Dominique Perben.</p>
<p>Nicole Notat, leader of the large CFDT union, listed civil service pay among her main concerns when spelling out what she expected of the new government earlier this week.</p>
<p>Unions are still looking for a &quot;catch-up&quot; offer after a pay freeze in 1996, although they failed to muster strong support for a one-day strike after February's unilateral increase.</p>
<p>The picture becomes a bit more clouded on the question of privatisation. Firstly, the government has yet to make its own position clear on a string of sell-offs planned by the previous government.</p>
<p>Most urgent is the planned sale of a minority stake in France Telecom, which was initially supposed to be launched in July.</p>
<p>That was due to be followed by the sale of a 58-percent stake in defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF and the sell-off of the CIC bank and parent insurance company GAN.</p>
<p>Of the large unions, the only one categorically opposed to all privatisation is the Communist-led CGT, while the CFDT, FO and the Catholic CFTC have all said this week they are not hostile to opening up the telecoms operator's capital to private investors.</p>
<p>The outlook gets more muddled for the rest, where union objections at company level may be stronger than the principles laid down at national headquarters.</p>
<p>This, too, could prove to be the case for other privatisation plans that were less advanced, such as the sale of state bank Credit Lyonnais and Air France  UTAF.PA. ($ = 5.837 French Francs)</p>
