<headline>FUND VIEW - Volatile market scares off investors.</headline>

<p>Worried about volatility in the U.S. stock market, investors put less new cash into stock mutual funds in December, according to an estimate by an industry trade group released on Monday.</p>
<p>But several fund firms said that flows were looking up for January, with investors favoring large capitalization funds.</p>
<p>Net new cash into U.S. stock funds declined to an estimated $13.5 billion in December, from $17.1 billion in November, and below the $16.39 billion in flows in December 1995, the Investment Company Institute said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The estimated slowing of flows in December likely reflects the volatility of the stock market in early December,&quot; as well as investors' deferring purchases until funds completed year-end dividend and capital gains distributions, the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Dow Industrials suffered declines in the first two weeks of December, then had two weeks of increases, before ending the month off about 72 points.</p>
<p>Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, a fund research firm, said he expected flows for the first five months of this year to fall below year-ago levels.  </p>
<p>&quot;December and January are going to be down because the flows coming from 401k (pension) money were so large last year, and a good bit of that were (pension) conversions rather than normal flows,&quot; said Lipper. &quot;It's not looking good for comparisons for perhaps the first five months.&quot;</p>
<p>Charles Biderman, editor of the Mutual Fund Trim Tabs newsletter, said he feared that the U.S. stock market, accustomed to the benefits of monthly flows of around $20 billion, could be disappointed.</p>
<p>Biderman said he believed that $15 billion per month in flows &quot;would be more sustainable&quot; this year.  </p>
<p>Several fund firms said January appeared to be headed for a healthy rebound in flows. Charles Schwab Corp saw a &quot;strong surge of activity&quot; in the first 10 days of this month, with $653 million in net flows into equity funds versus $60 million for all of December, according to a spokeswoman.</p>
<p>The strongest flows were into international and global equity funds, with about $225 million in flows for the January period versus $48 million in December.</p>
<p>Index funds were also popular, with $120 million versus $81 million.  </p>
<p>&quot;It could be that people tend to hold their powder while they figure out taxes for next year,&quot; said spokeswoman Tracey Gordon. &quot;In January, people look at the market, and say, 'I'm getting in.' There's also a lot of bonus money, year-end money going to work.&quot;</p>
<p>T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said, &quot;January so far was very good,&quot; with strong flows into its equity income, blue chip growth, growth and income, and international stock funds, according to Rowena Itchon, a spokeswoman.</p>
