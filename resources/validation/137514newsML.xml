<p>Copper and aluminium prices rallied briskly on Wednesday propelled by trade and speculative buying after a dull few weeks marked by disappointing seasonal demand. Some analysts saw a prospect of further gains in the industrial metals sector although copper, at least, met resistance during Wednesday's advance which was also fuelled by short covering. &quot;I think there's potential for more short-covering in both copper and aluminium,&quot; said William Adams at brokerage Rudolf Wolff.</p>
<p>London Metal Exchange (LME) three-months aluminium succeeded in closing the afternoon above the psychological threshold of $1,400 per tonne.</p>
<p>It ran up to a day's high at $1,411 before closing $39 up from Tuesday at $1,406.</p>
<p>Copper was not quite so buoyant. It raced above key technical resistance at $1,970 per tonne and hit $1,990 in the morning but ended at $1,976.</p>
<p>Producer sales and profit-taking were the reason why prices came off the highs.</p>
<p>Traders say that further falls in LME warehouse stocks are expected in aluminium. Copper inventories have already fallen by more than 100,000 tonnes since the end of August.</p>
<p>Copper has ignored news this week of the arrest on forgery charges of Yasuo Hamanaka, the trader who dominated the copper market until last June when Sumitomo Corp of Japan sacked him and alleged he ran up $2.6 billion of losses on rogue deals.</p>
<p>In Chicago, the price of nearby wheat futures was little changed around the $4.00 per bushel mark to which it sank after a slide from a record $7.50 in April. Bumper harvests have this year followed the widespread droughts of 1994.</p>
<p>London gold fixed slightly weaker at $383.50 an ounce in the afternoon compared to $383.95 in the morning. Despite a more bullish mood and a gain of $4 an ounce over the past three days, gold appeared to encounter stiff resistance.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't see gold getting up above $385,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Crude oil prices stayed firm just above $24 for a barrel of the benchmark Brent Blend from the North Sea but the rally of recent days was not reignited by late Wednesday. London robusta coffee for January recovered from early selling pressure to end easier by just $2 at a close of $1,425 per tonne. Cocoa and sugar were also little changed.</p>
