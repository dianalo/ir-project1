<p>The Thai baht is set for further weakness after the central bank on Wednesday fixed the currency at a 6-1/2-year low against the U.S. dollar and the greenback continued rising against other major currencies, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand on Wednesday fixed the baht/dollar mid-rate at 25.86, the lowest level since June 1990, against 25.81 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;If the dollar/yen goes higher, maybe for the first time in a long time we are going to see the baht/dollar at 26,&quot; Jimmy Koh, economist with Singapore-based I.D.E.A. Inc, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The dollar would remain strong against other major currencies, especially the yen, due to the United States' sound economic fundamentals and bullish stock market compared with Japan's weak economy, he said.</p>
<p>But senior foreign exchange traders said there was little reason for concern because, in real terms, the baht's value remained in line with most majors.</p>
<p>&quot;There is absolutely nothing to worry about the baht because the mid-rate has fallen in line with the dollar's strength and the subsequent drop in the yen and mark values,&quot; said N. Rajugopalan, Bank of America's vice-president and country treasurer.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who converted their U.S. dollar loans into baht and have not hedged their borrowings against fluctuations could face some problems. But those who have hedged don't really stand to lose,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand sets a daily mid-rate for the baht against a basket of currencies. The central bank does not disclose the content of the basket, but the dollar is believed to carry the highest weighting, followed by the yen and the mark.</p>
<p>The baht hit an intra-day low of 25.915 versus the dollar against a high of 25.840 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Both the Bank of Thailand and Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan have maintained that there would be no intervention in favour of the baht, despite the U.S. currency's upswing.</p>
<p>&quot;Thailand will not do anything about the baht's easing against the dollar because we think the volatility will be short-term, and it is caused by external factors,&quot; central bank spokeswoman Duangmani Vongprathip told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reason to intervene in favour of the baht because the U.S. dollar is appreciating against all currencies,&quot; Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan told reporters.</p>
<p>The baht's slide against the dollar also sparked investor concerns about the foreign exchange loss of dollar-denominated loans of some listed companies, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The impact (of the dollar's strength) on the loans of most listed companies should be quite serious,&quot; Robert F.Burgess at Maha Thanakit Finance and Securities Plc said.</p>
<p>Burgess said the baht was likely to reach 26.65 against the dollar in the first quarter of this year and, at worst, could tumble to 27 this year.</p>
<p>(US1 = 25.9 baht)</p>
