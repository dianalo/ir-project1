<p>By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Wednesday that U.S. stock prices may have risen too far and hinted that the central bank may need to raise interest rates in coming months.</p>
<p>Stock and bond prices tumbled after the remarks. The Dow Jones industrial average lost about 123 points in afternoon trading before recovering some ground.</p>
<p>In his semi-annual economic testimony to Congress, Greenspan conceded that the economic outlook was good but argued that Wall Street investors may have thrown caution to the wind in bidding up prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Such caution seems especially warranted with regard to the sharp rise in equity prices during the past two years,&quot; he told the Senate Banking Committee. &quot;These gains have obviously raised questions of sustainability.&quot;</p>
<p>Blue-chip shares have soared some 80 percent over the last two years, driving the stock market to record levels.</p>
<p>The central bank is concerned about the run-up in stock prices, Greenspan made clear, because it could be a harbinger of faster inflation ahead and could damage the economy if it abruptly reversed.</p>
<p>Greenspan credited much of the economy's recent good performance to the low rate of inflation but said that may not last, adding the Fed had to remain vigilant.</p>
<p>&quot;If we allow inflationary imbalances to start to emerge, history tells us that the end of the expansion is near at hand,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the Fed may even raise interest rates before inflation picks up to ensure that economy stays on an even keel and that the nearly six-year-old expansion continues.</p>
<p>&quot;We may decide to move ... before you see actual evidences of real inflation emerging,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Higher rates would tend to slow the economy and corporate profits and so even the prospect of higher rates upsets investors. Just before 3 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 106.59 points at 6,931.62.</p>
<p>The bond market also fell, with the 30-year Treasury down 1-7/8 points, or $18.75 on a $1,000 bond, pushing its yield to 6.80 percent from 6.66 percent on Tuesday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Former Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder told Reuters that Greenspan sounded &quot;decidedly more hawkish&quot; on interest rates than before. &quot;Greenspan clearly is putting everyone on notice that the Fed is not asleep at the wheel,&quot; Blinder, now a professor at Princeton University, said.</p>
<p>Any moves by the Fed to raise interest rates would probably not be as aggressive as in 1994-95, when the central bank doubled short-term rates in a bid to prevent the economy from overheating.</p>
<p>Conditions now are different, Greenspan said. In fact, the current level of interest rates coupled with the recent rise of the dollar may be enough to contain inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;Nonetheless we cannot be sure,&quot; he added. &quot;And the risks of being wrong are clearly tilted to the upside.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fed has not raised interest rates in two years. Its next policy-making meeting is on March 25.</p>
<p>Greenspan said Fed policy-makers expect inflation to remain low this year, with consumer prices rising 2.75 percent to 3.0 percent. Consumer prices rose 3.2 percent last year.</p>
<p>But the Fed chief warned that many of the factors that have held down inflation, including subdued wage demands due to worker insecurity, were temporary.</p>
<p>He also saw the possibility that the so-called core inflation rate, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, may rise this year.</p>
<p>Greenspan said Fed policy-makers expect the economy to grow about 2 percent to 2.5 percent in 1997. The economy grew 3.4 percent last year.</p>
<p>Central bank officials expect unemployment to stay roughly steady and be at about current levels in the fourth quarter. In January, unemployment was 5.4 percent.</p>
<p>Greenspan spent much of his testimony discussing what he called the recent extraordinary rise of the stock market.</p>
<p>Just as he did in December when he rocked global stock prices, Greenspan again raised the question of whether so-called &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; was affecting the markets.</p>
<p>&quot;There are reasons in the current environment to keep this question on the table,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While it is possible that economic conditions have fundamentally changed for the better, as many in the market seem to believe, Greenspan argued that the business cycle is not dead and that an eventual recession is inevitable.</p>
<p>The best way to guard against a downturn is to keep inflation in check. &quot;Sustainable economic expansion for 1997 and beyond depends on it,&quot; Greenspan said.</p>
