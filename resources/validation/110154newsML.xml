<p>Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA PDVSA could conceivably be sold off in the next few years, PDVSA president and CEO Luis Giusti said Friday.</p>
<p>Asked whether PDVSA might be in line for privatization after other state assets, which are due to go up for sale, Giusti said no one was talking about it now, but he did not rule it out.</p>
<p>&quot;We will probably be doing a few years from now things that we are not talking about today,&quot; he said at a luncheon at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.  </p>
<p>He noted that PDVSA was taking steps today which it would not have discussed five years ago, such as inviting international companies to explore for and produce oil and gas in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Deregulating the domestic oil products market would be more of a challenge than opening the production or petrochemicals sector, he said.</p>
<p>PDVSA is working to reform the legal framework for the domestic market, which Giusti said would be &quot;more uphill&quot; in Congress.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're going to have other brands and other companies working, struggling and competing for the distribution market in Venezuela,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked whether PDVSA was looking to expand its refinery holdings in the United States or looking at Sun Co refineries in particular, Giusti said: &quot;We're always interested in everything. We're permanently looking at the portfolio,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It will depend, of course, first of all on a strategic fit of any of the facilities, and second if the the deal can be worked out in terms of the economics and the implications in terms of investment,&quot; he said after his speech.</p>
<p>PDVSA's U.S. interests already include CITGO plants, projects with Unocal and Chevron Corp, and a planned stake in a Mobil Corp refinery.</p>
<p>Giusti repeated projections he made last month that PDVSA would make a net profit of $4.4 billion in 1996.</p>
