<p>Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said he was not concerned about the weakening of the Swedish crown and that he stood by his government's plan to spend 10 billion crowns extra from 1998 onwards.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase in interest rates and the weakening of the crown are certainly temporary swings. But it is still the actual budgetary outcome that counts and that shows we will reach our goal. It is my judgement we will manage the 10 billion from 1998,&quot; he told reporters in this western city.</p>
<p>The crown has weakened in the past two weeks, partly on fears that the centre-left government is weakening on its austerity measures for the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Long-term things look different. Then it's fundamentals that count and they are speaking in our favour. When the markets pick on us in this way, it's time for us politicians to join together and stand by the decisions we have taken,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He predicted a budget deficit for 1997 of less than three percent of GDP.</p>
<p>&quot;I know it will be better than that. In 1998 we'll reach a balance and from 1999 we will start reducing state debt.&quot;</p>
