<p>India's first private telephone service will be available to customers only a year after private operators conclude licensing agreements with the government, a senior government official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;One year would be the minimum gestation period before the first phone could be installed,&quot; A.V. Gokak, chairman of the Telecom Commission, which is carrying out the programme to end a state monopoly on telephones, told a business seminar.</p>
<p>India lifted a decades-old state monopoly on its telecommunication industry under an economic reform programme launched in 1991.</p>
<p>Private telephone firms awarded licences by the government last year had protested against what they said were high interconnectivity charges to link up their services with the network of the state-run Department of Telecommunictions (DoT).</p>
<p>Gokak, speaking at a seminar organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), said he hoped basic telephone service operators would sign their licence agreements after some contentious issues were sorted out.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the government slashed interconnectivity charges in basic services, resolving the issue, Gokak said. Private firms say they are still considering the new financial implications after the cut in charges.</p>
<p>India allowed private companies to provide both basic and value-added services like mobile telephones, radio paging and electronic mail in 1994.</p>
<p>The new telecommunications policy permits foreign investors to hold up to 49 percent of the equity in firms providing basic services and up to 51 percent in those offering value-added services.</p>
