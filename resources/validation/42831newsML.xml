<p>The Finnish ministry of trade and industry (KTM) said on Tuesday the government planned an international and domestic offering of shares in chemicals and fertiliser group Kemira Oy this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The offering is expected to reduce the residual holding of the Finnish state to around 55 percent, taking into account any new shares to be included in the offering by Kemira,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Kemira said earlier its board was seeking authorisation to issue up to eight million new shares.</p>
<p>A final decision on the state offering would be subject to market conditions at the appropriate time, KTM said.</p>
<p>The government currently holds 72.3 percent of Kemira and has authority to lower this to 50.1 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The purpose of the share capital increase is to finance growth in Kemira's core business areas through acquisitions or other investments,&quot; Kemira said.</p>
<p>Kemira said it will also propose at the meeting to waive the preferential right of the current shareholders to purchase shares issued.</p>
<p>The issue authority would run from September 26 until the next annual general meeting, it said.</p>
<p>Kemira's share capital is currently 1,208 million markka ($266.6 million) , and it has 120.8 million shares each with a nominal value of 10 markka.</p>
<p>Kemira also said it will bring forward the publication of its January-August report to October 3. ($ = 4.530 Finnish Markka)</p>
