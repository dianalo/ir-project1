<p>Canadian spot natural gas prices climbed a few cents Wednesday as supply in Alberta remained tight amid low line pack levels on the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd pipeline system, traders said.</p>
<p>But prices were expected to weaken by the end of the week as more gas plants ended scheduled maintenance work and nominations on NOVA climbed, a Calgary-based marketer said.</p>
<p>Spot gas at the AECO storage hub in Alberta was quoted at C$1.54/1.55 per gigajoule, up about three cents from Tuesday but down over a dime from last week. July AECO was discussed at C$1.48/1.52 per GJ, a two-cent jump from Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Term deals also rose, with July-October gas talked at C$1.52 per GJ, up from C$1.47-1.49 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The marketer said storage injections were expected to pick back up into the one billion cubic feet per day range in Alberta next week, as more gas came available and prices weakened. Injections were reported at 576 million cubic feet a day on Tuesday.</p>
<p>At the borders, gas for export at Niagara in southern Ontario was quoted in the mid-US$2.30s per million British thermal units, up about seven cents on the day, but down about 12 cents from last Wednesday.</p>
<p>A trader of eastern Canadian gas said the increase from Tuesday followed a similar climb in the July NYMEX contract. &quot;Prices are tracking the screen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the west, gas at the Huntington/Sumas border point climbed about three cents on the day into the US$1.18/1.20 range, a move a British Columbia market source said was in line with the stronger AECO price.</p>
<p>Scheduled maintenance at Westcoast Energy Inc's Pine River gas plant also took about 100 million cubic feet a day off the system, he said. ((Reuters Calgary Bureau (403) 531-1624))</p>
