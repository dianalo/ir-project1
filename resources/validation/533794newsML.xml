<headline>Japan's Yamaichi to sue over media reports.</headline>

<p>Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd is set to take legal action on reports about its business dealings, while its bigger rival Nomura Securities Co Ltd is in the public eye over a scandal linking the firm with a racketeer.</p>
<p>Yamaichi, the smallest of Japan's &quot;Big Four&quot; brokerages, said earlier this week that it would file libel suits against a Japanese newspaper and magazines, saying their reports could hurt its business.</p>
<p>The media reports hit Yamaichi at a time when the brokerage's business has already been weakened by a prolonged stockmarket slump. Yamaichi also needs to support some of its finance units suffering from the bursting of Japan's &quot;bubble economy&quot; of inflated share and land prices in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>&quot;Their articles are totally groundless and obstruct our business. There is no actual damage made to our business yet but we are preparing to file suits on the fear they may hurt our business in future,&quot; a Yamaichi spokesman said.</p>
<p>The media reports helped push down Yamaichi's shares by eight yen by midday on Monday on the Tokyo stockmarket, although by the close of trade the share price was up one yen at 355 yen.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Yamaichi shares closed up five yen at 360.</p>
<p>Last week, Yamaichi chairman Tsugio Yukihira told reporters that the company had no illegal &quot;tobashi&quot; deals, in which brokers seek to hide a client's investment losses by transferring them to another client's account.</p>
<p>Yukihira was responding to a question about media reports in the past month that Yamaichi had carried out such deals.</p>
<p>Asked about media claims that Yamaichi had conducted tobashi deals worth 400 billion yen ($3.17 billion), Yukihira said: &quot;I would like to decline to comment... but because this matter relates to confidence in the industry, I must say that we don't have any such deals at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Japan's securities industry, already hurt by falling commissions due to a stagnant stockmarket, suffered another setback last month when industry leader Nomura said two of its directors were involved in suspected illegal deals in which Nomura money was moved to the account of a corporate customer.</p>
<p>Media reports have said the customer is linked to a &quot;sokaiya&quot; racketeer. Sokaiya extort money from companies by threatening to disrupt shareholders' meetings.</p>
<p>Japanese prosecutors and Japan's securities watchdog have been investigating Nomura, which on Tuesday unveiled a reshuffle in its top management, including the resignation of its president, to win back public trust in the brokerage.</p>
<p>The Nomura scandal has cast a long shadow over share prices in the securities sector as a whole, including Yamaichi's.</p>
<p>Yamaichi's business outlook is also gloomy.</p>
<p>Yamaichi has recently cut its estimate for a parent current profit to nil in the 1996/97 fiscal year which ended in March from its previous forecast of 19 billion yen ($150 million), against profits of 15.13 billion yen ($120 million) in 1995/96.</p>
<p>It said it would post a net loss of 163 billion yen  ($1.29 billion) for the year. Current profit is pre-tax and includes gains and losses made on investments.</p>
<p>Yamaichi said last week it was considering assisting its financially troubled affiliates. Industry sources said that Yamaichi would buy about 600 million yen ($4.76 million) in new shares of one of its affiliate brokerages.</p>
<p>Credit rating firm Standard &amp; Poor's Corp last week said it might cut its BBB+ long-term debt ratings on Yamaichi. ($1= 126 yen)</p>
