<p>German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said on Thursday he regretted the European Commission's decision to investigate state aid to France's Elf Aquitaine to build the Leuna refinery in east Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;From my point of view this step would not be needed to clear up the matter further,&quot; Rexrodt said in a statement after Brussels announced its decision on Wednesday.  </p>

<p>Rexrodt said Bonn had answered all the Commission's questions about the case, and had also handed over the findings of a probe commissioned by the BvS, the body responsible for privatising state-owned assets in the former East Germany.</p>
<p>He added that an investigation by state prosecutors had also failed to find any evidence that government subsidies had been granted to fictitious investment projects, and that the case had been closed.</p>
<p>Rexrodt said he hoped the Brussel probe would be completed quickly.</p>
<p>The European Commission's decision forces Bonn to provide long-sought information over whether Elf-Aquitaine may have inflated the costs of building the refinery to claim larger subsidies.</p>
<p>Elf has calculated that the total cost was 4.3 billion marks. But the German press has reported that calculations by the BvS, the successor to the Treuhand privatisation agency, showed the real cost was over one billion marks lower.</p>
