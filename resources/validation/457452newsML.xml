<p>German steelmaker Thyssen, after years of playing coy, may finally be driven into the arms of Krupp.</p>
<p>Intimately linked with the industrialisation, militarisation and postwar reconstruction of Germany itself, Thyssen and Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp have often been tempted to cooperate in the past 15 years, with little success.</p>
<p>But now, the need to transform German steel into a slimmed-down, high-tech industry that can hold its own against low-cost competitors has grown more pressing.</p>
<p>A merger of their steel operations, the aim of talks that started on Thursday, sits better with Germany's corporate culture than the hostile takeover bid Krupp launched this week, reminiscent of its successful attack on Hoesch in 1991.</p>
<p>A tie-up would create one of Europe's largest steel producers and continue a long process of consolidation of the German steel industry, which has shed tens of thousands of jobs in an often painful process of modernisation.</p>
<p>The two have given themselves a week to forge a deal. If the talks fail, Krupp will resume its bank-backed hostile bid for its larger rival Thyssen.</p>
<p>Merging their steel units could help them go further to cut steel-production capacity than either could go alone, likely at the cost of thousands or even tens of thousands of jobs.</p>
<p>By agreeing to talk instead of acting out a takeover battle, the two are less likely to upset the German public, keenly aware unemployment is at its highest level since 1933.</p>
<p>&quot;A mutually agreeable merger of steel activities is much more suited to the German environment than a hostile takeover,&quot; said analyst Hermann Reith of BHF Bank.</p>
<p>The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said in an editorial, &quot;Confining the fusion to the steel sector alone will not save a single job. But in other company divisions the social tinder is defused for awhile.&quot;</p>
<p>The sharp drop in Thyssen's share price on Thursday when exchange trading resumed shows that most investors believe the steel talks will succeed. The share was trading at about 375.80 marks, well below Krupp's offer of 435 marks, a level it nearly reached on the grey market during a two-day bourse suspension.</p>
<p>Analysts' speculation has centered on Krupp's Dortmund steel mill as the most likely site for cuts, as it is less modern than a similar Thyssen plant.</p>
<p>Krupp said on Thursday it could make no guarantee to keep the Dortmund plant open, but said any cuts would not be confined to Dortmund alone.</p>
<p>Analysts say it makes little sense to cut less than the output of an entire plant, but a combined Krupp-Thyssen steel company would find it easier to cut on that scale.</p>
<p>Personnel reductions have become a way of life as the industry modernises production methods and reduces capacity. The German Steel Association estimates employment in the sector averaged 116,000 in 1996, down from 219,000 in 1991.</p>
<p>Thyssen Stahl, the Thyssen group's steel unit, had cut its group work force to 35,990 at the end of September 1996 from 59,552 five years earlier.</p>
<p>Cooperation and further rationalisation between Krupp and Thyssen would likely spur a round of similar moves among European competitors. British Steel, Europe's largest producer, itself announced plans to cut 5,000 jobs this year on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, Europe's biggest steelmakers lost billions of dollars as the industry's worst post-war slump was caused by huge overcapacities, weak economic demand, a bitter price war and flood of cheap imports from eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The European Union, after two years of intense debate with the industry, curbed imports from the east in 1993 and forced the end of subsidies to steel producers in southern Europe.</p>
<p>A subsequent pickup in demand helped steel prices to recover, but this braked the industry's rationalisation too soon, while there was still a considerable capacity overhang.</p>
<p>A sluggish economy in 1996 again crimped steel makers' profits, forcing them to look again for ways to cut costs.</p>
<p>Krupp's hostile takeover attempt appears to be the result of failed past efforts to convince Thyssen to cooperate on a broader basis, but the brash style upset unions and politicians in Germany's Ruhr Valley industrial heartland.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Clement, a state cabinet official with enormous clout, whose Social Democratic party can usually be counted on to fight for every job in sight, was glad the two were talking but admitted the state had little power to save jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;Let no one be fooled. The alternative to a crash course, a joint steel company, will not just secure jobs, it will also cost jobs.&quot;</p>
