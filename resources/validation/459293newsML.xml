<p>SIMEX Euroyen and Japanese government bond (JGB) futures were off their lows in late Friday trade after a technically-driven sell-off earlier.</p>
<p>Sentiment remained very weak on growing expectations of a U.S. interest rate hike at next week's Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting, dealers said.</p>
<p>This expectation was fuelled after Fed chief Alan Greenspan repeated on Thursday the need for the central bank to be pre-emptive in its fight against inflation.  </p>
<p>&quot;What's not helped is that the Fed is leaning towards a pre-emptive tightening. Greenspan had it written all over his forehead last night,&quot; said a trader with a European house.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a suspicion they'll raise it by 25 basis points, which of course puts pressure on the dollar/yen. But I don't see Japan hiking rates to defend the yen,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>December Euroyen was quoted at 98.94 at 1120 GMT after falling as low as 98.89 against an IMM close at 99.03. Volume was an active 31,670 lots.  </p>
<p>Dealers said stop-loss sell orders were triggered around 99.01 and then at 98.97. They said the contract looked supported around 98.87/88 but a breach of that area would expose it to further weakness to as far as 98.70/72.</p>
<p>They said there was little fresh news behind the sell-off and players seemed to ignore reports that Moody's Investors Service had downgraded Nippon Credit Bank's bond ratings, a factor that would normally underpin the market.  </p>
<p>&quot;We started to see some swap-related selling in Tokyo of a fairly chunky size and that just spooked a thin Euroyen market. Then it was just very technical. There were stops going off all over the place,&quot; said the trader.</p>
<p>A Japanese bank dealer said expectations of firmer interest rates in the cash market ahead of the financial year end on March 31 also spurred Euroyen futures sales for hedging.</p>
<p>But he said Euroyen and JGB futures were likely to consolidate and move sideways ahead of the year end and the Bank of Japan (BOJ)'s quarterly tankan on April 2.</p>
<p>June JGBs settled at 125.49 against their previous 126.09.  </p>
<p>Eurodollar futures ended slightly little changed in thin trade. Dealers said the market had priced in a 25 basis point rate hike.</p>
<p>June Eurodollars finished at 94.070 against its IMM close at 94.075. September were at 93.830 against 93.825.</p>
