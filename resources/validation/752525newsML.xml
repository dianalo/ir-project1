<p>Slovenia's blue-chip SBI index closed higher on Thursday, extending its winning streak into the fifth day and brokers are optimistic more gains still lie ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;All blue-chip shares rose today and there is optimism in the air so more gains can be expected over the summer. The new all-time high will most probably be reached if gains continue at the current pace,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>The SBI index rose 32.82 points or 2.15 percent to 1,557.27. This week alone the index has jumped 5.35 percent.</p>
<p>Overall 17 shares rose and three fell while one was flat and seven untraded. Turnover fell to 333 million tolars from 529.2 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Turnover was down mostly due to lower volume on Lek as it seems like foreigners pulled out for some time and now speculators are in,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>Mineral water producer and health resort operator Radenska was the most active, easing 0.21 percent to 1,890 tolars on volume of 9,115 shares.</p>
<p>Port operator Luka Koper was the top gainer, jumping 9.20 percent to 2,100 tolars on volume of 3,432 shares.</p>
<p>&quot;Luka is one of the shares that did not rise much recently and brokers see it as an alternative investment,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Brokerage Nika led decliners, falling 2.68 percent to 3,600 tolars on volume of 300 shares.</p>
<p>Drug maker Lek firmed 0.28 percent to 35,600 tolars on volume of 1,695 shares. Most traders see Lek rising over 40,000 tolars soon. -- Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
