<p>Spain's employers reassured the government on Thursday they would soon clinch a deal with unions to liberalise one of Europe's most rigid labour markets and prepare the economy for European monetary union.</p>
<p>After weeks of tense talks between employers and unions, the government warned on Wednesday it was ready to step in and force an accord on labour market reforms to help cut the towering unemployment rate.</p>
<p>But employers said government intervention would not be necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect that within the next days we can announce that we have arrived at an important level of approximation that will allow us to say that we have reached an agreement,&quot; Jose Maria Cuevas, president of Spain's employers association CEOE told a conference on reform and growth in Madrid.</p>
<p>Unions refrained from celebrating a success so soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Talks are at a delicate point and are difficult but there is certainly a possibility of reaching an agreement,&quot; a spokesman from leading union CCOO said. Leaders from both sides are due to meet again on Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>The government has given unions and employers until the beginning of March to reach a deal before it steps in.</p>
<p>Shortly after taking office, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said his priority was to reach a jobs pact with unions to help tackle Spain's unemployment, currently the worst in Europe at around 22 percent.</p>
<p>Industry Minister Josep Pique said on Thursday, however, a forced agreement would not be realistic.</p>
<p>&quot;Reform is the key word here but in order to achieve it, we must involve both the unions and employers because reform without consensus loses its effectiveness,&quot; Pique told a conference in Madrid.</p>
<p>Labour Minister Javier Arenas was confident they would reach a deal without the need for prodding from the government.</p>
<p>&quot;We are optimistic for an accord...Those who are pessimists are just tired optimists and I'm not tired,&quot; he told a conference.</p>
<p>Arenas said a labour reform pact must promote contract stability, develop professional training, help youths integrate into the market and clarify firing terms.</p>
<p>&quot;We must produce a real convergence with the rest of Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Unions say the negotiations have come to a near standstill on a number of occasions in past weeks on two key areas, contract stability and dismissal costs.</p>
<p>Employers have complained that unions are dreaming up unrealistic &quot;miracle recipes&quot; such as job-sharing schemes.</p>
<p>Their main sticking point is high dismissal costs for workers on permanent contracts, which they say make employers reluctant to take on employees long-term.</p>
<p>Unions, meanwhile, are determined to solve the problem of contract instability that plagues Spain's labour market.</p>
<p>A Labour Ministry survey found that more than 96 percent of new jobs created in 1996 were temporary, and half of those were on contracts lasting less than a month.</p>
