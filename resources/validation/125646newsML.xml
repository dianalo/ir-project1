<p>The Atlanta Braves crushed the St Louis Cardinals 15-0 Thursday, coming back from the brink of elimination to win three straight games to stampede into the World Series against the New York Yankees.</p>
<p>The defending World Champion Braves racked up six runs in the first inning and went on to a 17-hit romp, including a three-run triple by pitcher Tom Glavine, who allowed a paltry three singles, struck out four and issued no walks.</p>
<p>The World Series is set to begin Saturday night in New York.</p>
<p>Braves' catcher Javy Lopez was the Most Valuable Player of the series, batting a seven-game Championship Series record .542 with two homers and six RBI. He homered and drove in three runs Thursday.</p>
<p>Winning the MVP &quot;is a privilege, and I feel real proud,&quot; Lopez said. &quot;We've got another series to go and hopefully we can win.</p>
<p>&quot;There wasn't the feeling that one guy did the whole job. I think that with the whole team cooperating, that's why we're here.&quot;</p>
<p>The Braves outscored the Cardinals 32-1 in the final three games to become the first team to win a National League Championship Series after trailing three games to one.</p>
<p>The Braves beat the Cardinals 14-0 on Monday and 3-1 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;After the first inning, my job was pretty darn easy and that was all down to the offence,&quot; Glavine said.</p>
<p>About his triple, Glavine said: &quot;You work on (batting). You never know when it's gonna make a difference in a ballgame. Tonight I hit it huge.&quot;</p>
<p>Cardinals' starting pitcher Donovan Osborne, who outpitched Glavine in Game Three, gave up six runs and five hits, getting just two outs before manager Tony La Russa ended the torture.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt fine,&quot; Osborne said. &quot;I warmed up like I always do. I wasn't nervous. I left a few balls up and you can't do that against a team like the Braves.</p>
<p>Osborne's first two pitches were hit by Marquis Grissom for a single and Mark Lemke for a double. The runners held as Chipper Jones grounded out, and Grissom scored as Lemke was caught in a rundown on Fred McGriff's grounder.</p>
<p>Osborne had a chance to escape but allowed singles to rookies Jermaine Dye and Andruw Jones that plated another run. Then he hit Jeff Blauser with a pitch to set the stage for Glavine's triple past a diving Ron Gant in left field.</p>
<p>&quot;They deserve to go (to the World Series),&quot; Osborne said. &quot;They played better than we did. I had a great year that's how I will deal with it.&quot;</p>
<p>After the soft cushion his teammates gave him, Glavine went into cruise control.</p>
<p>In the fourth inning, Lemke and Chipper Jones drew one-out walks from Andy Benes and McGriff's RBI single was thrown away by right fielder Willie McGee, allowing Chipper Jones to score. Lopez blasted a two-run homer over the centre-field wall, making it 10-0.</p>
<p>In the sixth, St. Louis shortstop Ozzie Smith, who has said this is his last season, popped out as a pinch-hitter in what likely was his last major-league at-bat. The future Hall-of-Famer was given a standing ovation by the Braves' fans.</p>
<p>In the sixth, McGriff tripled, Lopez doubled and 19-year-old Andruw Jones homered off Mark Petkovsek, making it 13-0.</p>
<p>In the seventh inning, Chipper Jones singled and McGriff launched his third post-season homer to complete the carnage.</p>
<p>McGriff had three hits, four RBI and four runs scored. Andrew Jones had two hits, three runs scored and two RBI.</p>
<p>Grissom, Lemke, Chipper Jones and Rafael Belliard -- a shortstop who came in for defence in the second inning -- each added two hits.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm thinking about our ballclub,&quot; La Russa said. &quot;The loss stings a lot because of the type of game.&quot;</p>
