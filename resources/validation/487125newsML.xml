<p>Zaire rebel leader Laurent Kabila said on Friday his forces were less than 10 km (6 miles) from diamond capital Mbuji-Mayi, playing down earlier reports the city had been taken.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going forward, we are advancing and we are not far less than 10 km from Mbuji-Mayi and in the vicinity of Lubumbashi,&quot; Kabila told a news conference.  </p>
<p>Mining sources in Lubumbashi and traders said earlier on Friday that rebels had marched into Mbuji-Mayi after Zairean troops looted and fled to nearby Kananga.</p>
<p>Rebels also launched a bitter attack against the U.N.'s refugee policy and condemned a U.N. human rights report on abuses in rebel territory.</p>
<p>Kabila said he would not reconsider an offer by new Zairean prime minister Etienne Tshisekedi of six cabinet posts for rebels in his government, adding there would be a ceasefire if Mobutu stepped down.</p>
<p>Rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo/Zaire (AFDL) who have seized more than one-fifth of the vast country since lat October pose a grave threat to ailing Mobutu, president since 1965.</p>
