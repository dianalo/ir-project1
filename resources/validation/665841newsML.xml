<p>Third-seeded Peter Nicol of Scotland on Monday dashed Egyptian teenager Ahmed Barada's hopes of meeting world champion Jansher Khan in the final of the al-Ahram International Squash Championship.</p>
<p>On an open-air glass court set up beside the Great Pyramids of Giza outside Cairo, Nicol defeated 19-year-old Barada 14-15 15-11 15-12 15-13 in a 107-minute semi-final match.</p>
<p>In the second semi-final, played in the early hours of Tuesday, Pakistan's Khan saw off qualifier Alex Gough of Wales 15-11 15-12 15-5, clearing the way for a repeat of the British Open final which Jansher and Nicol contested in April.</p>
<p>An Egyptian crowd of some 3,000 gave fifth-seeded Barada thunderous applause, rooting for a replay of last year's final in which the Egyptian, then an unseeded wild card, went down to the longstanding champion.</p>
<p>But neither support from the crowd nor the local hero's exceptionally physical play could stop the Scot stealing the match.</p>
<p>&quot;I played my own game and was not affected by the crowd,&quot; Nicol said. &quot;I felt a lot of pressure but it was pressure I put on myself. I nearly blew it in the fourth game but I managed to get my rallying back together again.&quot;</p>
<p>Barada's tactics brought 103 decisions and a couple of conduct warnings from Egyptian referee Nasser Zahran.</p>
<p>One warning was for dangerous play when Barada, pursuing a clinical drop shot in the top right corner at 12-12, ignored the ball and hacked Nicol's feet out from under him.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a fearsome tackle,&quot; Nicol said. &quot;I was left with two dead legs and my calves were still aching from the impact at the end of the match.&quot;</p>
<p>But the tackle did not stop Nicol moving fast -- the key to the Scot's victory. Nicol let a first-game lead of 13-10 deteriorate to a lost single-point tie-break but he calmly controlled the closing stages of each of the following games.</p>
<p>Less excitement marked the women's semi-finals, in which top-seeded world champion Sarah Fitz-Gerald defeated Carol Owens in straight games and second-seeded Michelle Martin similarly dispatched Sabine Schone of Germany to set up a repeat of the all-Australian British Open final last April.</p>
