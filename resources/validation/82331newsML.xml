<p>Dutch shares set a new closing high on Friday, but with little conviction, as prices moved in a narrow band and faded towards the end of the session.</p>
<p>The AEX index of 25 blue chips closed 0.55 points or 0.10 percent higher at 571.92, beating the previous all-time closing high of 571.76 set on June 6 by a narrow margin of 0.16 points.</p>
<p>Shares of paper, packaging and office supplies group KNP BT rose sharply in the morning on hopes that the company might be about to sell off its loss-making paper business. But the shares soon reversed their gains, closing 0.20 guilders lower at 41.40 after the company said a partnership was more likely.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole thing is far less spectacular than it seems at first sight,&quot; said Wijgert Verstoep of MeesPierson after attending a company briefing for analysts.</p>
<p>Dealers said Dutch share prices were likely to drift sideways in coming sessions as investors wait for lower prices or hard evidence of a firm uptrend before entering the market.</p>
<p>The AMX index of 25 medium-size or mid-cap companies outperformed its big brother, the AEX, rising 8.56 points or 0.98 percent to 886.18.</p>
<p>Dealers said AMX stocks were probably supported by the launch of merchant bank Kempen &amp; Co's 210-million-guilder Orange Midcap Fund.</p>
