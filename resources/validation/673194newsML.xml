<title>USA: OPTIONS - Heavy selling in dlr/yen short dates.</title>
<headline>OPTIONS - Heavy selling in dlr/yen short dates.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-19</dateline>

<p>Implied volatilities for dollar/yen options declined substantially in U.S. trading Thursday amid active selling of short-dated options, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing fairly aggressive selling of the yen vols in the front end, but the risk reversal hasn't moved,&quot; said Soma Rao, options sales manager for Smith Barney.</p>
<p>The one-month 25-delta risk reversal remained sharply skewed for yen calls at 2.2/2.4 as the supply/demand imbalance that developed in the wake of dollar/yen's plunge toward 110 last week kept yen calls strongly bid, dealers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is still a lot of interest to buy yen calls for protection on the downside. Both corporations and funds are driving the demand,&quot; Rao said.</p>
<p>Risk reversals are a gauge of market preference for calls or puts.</p>
<p>The dollar climbed back above 114 yen this morning after the overall U.S. April trade deficit was reported at a smaller than expected $8.36 billion. The deficit with Japan grew by 5.1 percent to $4.84 billion.  </p>
<p>Foreign currency market participants said Japanese data released earlier this week showing the nation's trade gap with the U.S. continued to widen in May was worrisome.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still afraid of a sharp move down&quot; in dollar/yen, said Rao.</p>
<p>One-month dollar/yen volatility had dived to 11.6/11.9 percent by midday, a decline of 1.5 percentage points from late Wednesday. One-year was off about 0.4 point at 10.6/10.9 percent.  </p>
<p>Traders said selling interest was concentrated especially in one-month at-the-money options, but that interest also extended to two- and three-months and further out the curve.</p>
<p>A $500 million trade overnight involving 115-strike yen puts with one-week maturity at 14.75 percent to 14.25 percent volatility likely weighed on the short end of the curve, said a U.S. bank trader.</p>
<p>In addition, interest in out-of-the-money dollar puts down to the 102 strike and selling of out-of-the-money yen puts and dollar calls was seen overnight, traders said.  </p>
<p>There was also talk that a large exotic options position with a trigger of 112.50 yen was being protected.</p>
<p>Shorter-dated dollar/mark volatilities continued to weaken, with one-month slipping 0.2 point to 8.8/9.1 percent, gradually steepening the curve's upward slope. Meanwhile, one-year was slightly firmer at 9.4/9.6 percent.</p>
<p>The U.S. bank trader said the sale of a $500 million, three-month low-delta dollar/guilder position may have had a spillover weakening effect on shorter-dated dollar/mark volatility.</p>
