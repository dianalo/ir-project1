<p>Jordanian shares rose on Tuesday, the eve of the Moslem Eid al Adha holiday, on healthy investor demand on the country's only cement producer, brokers said.</p>
<p>The official Amman Financial Market (AFM) index rose 0.15 percent to 152.80 points in healthy turnover of 620,063 dinars ($875,795).</p>
<p>Trade was dominated by blue-chip Jordan Cement Factories which accounted for nearly half the day's volume.</p>
<p>The stock, which rose 0.06 dinars to 3.65 dinars, has risen for the second day running on by prospects of improved earnings after a slight price hike after the government this week slightly readjusted higher fixed prices of cement.</p>
<p>Investors expect it will boost the firm's profitability.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was stable, with Jordan Cement pushing the market higher,&quot; said Mohammad Abdullah, analyst at Pearl Consulting.</p>
<p>The market will close on Wednesday April 16, the first day of an official five-day public holiday to mark the Moslem Eid al Adha feast. Business resumes on Monday April 21.</p>
<p>The exchange also continued a pattern of bargain hunting activity by mostly local investors in a handful of speculative and blue-chip stock prompted by recent falls which have made current price levels attractive, brokers said.</p>
<p>Political uncertainty combined with a lack of liquidity has recently depressed sentiment and prompted outside buyers and institutional investors to remain on the sidelines.</p>
<p>The second busiest stock was Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing which was unchanged at 3.65 dinars in trade worth 91,250 dinars.</p>
<p>In banks, Housing Bank was unchanged at 4.90 dinars, continuing a pattern of demand on expectation of better performance after a new law was passed which expanded its commercial banking business base.</p>
<p>Market heavyweight Arab Bank rose a marginal 0.25 dinars to 256.00 dinars in third largest trading volume worth 87,545 dinars.</p>
<p>The market on Tuesday saw ten shares rising against 11 declining. Another 16 were traded but closed unchanged.</p>
<p>The private Pearl Index of the 45 best performing shares in terms of turnover and financial performance was unchanged at 80.46 points, 3.52 percent down from the start of the year.</p>
