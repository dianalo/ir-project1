<p>The five members of the European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) on Friday agreed on liberalisation of trade covering industrial products, standards for rules of origin of goods and future expansion of the group.</p>
<p>A document signed at the end of a one-day summit meeting of the prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, said members had achieved significant progress in mutual trade since the inception of CEFTA in 1992.</p>
<p>In the delicate sphere of agriculture the four bowed to Slovenia's request for concessions by extending the deadline for Ljubljana to introduce the abolition of barriers to trade in agricultural products.</p>
<p>&quot;(The four CEFTA countries) expect that the Slovenian side will minimalise the number of exceptions and will be ready to abolish them from January 1, 1999,&quot; the joint document said.</p>
<p>Slovenian officials said the concessions gave them breathing space to bring their agriculture into line with other members, especially in the fields of meat and meat products.</p>
<p>The five also agreed to expand their ranks by admitting Romania next year and said Bulgaria was nearing fulfilling membership criteria.</p>
<p>Membership in CEFTA is conditioned on applicants satisfying World Trade Organisation rules and internal CEFTA regulations, including the access to all free-trade accords with all member countries.</p>
<p>The other associate members of CEFTA, Ukraine, Latvia and Lithuania who also attended the meeting, are also seeking full membership.</p>
<p>The annual CEFTA summit meeting reviewed progress in liberalising trade within the grouping.</p>
<p>Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar told journalists after the meeeting that Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin had sent a letter to CEFTA declaring Russias willingness to begin a dialogue on possible cooperation with the grouping.</p>
<p>&quot;But Russia does not at present want to become a CEFTA member,&quot; Meciar said.</p>
<p>Slovakia currently holds the rotating presidency of CEFTA, which will go to Slovenia from next January.</p>
