<title>USA: S&amp;P UPS AEGON PROVIDIAN CORP RATINGS.</title>
<headline>S&amp;P UPS AEGON PROVIDIAN CORP RATINGS.</headline>
<text>
<p>NEW YORK, July 23 - Standard &amp; Poor's today has raised its issuer credit and claims-paying ability ratings of Commonwealth Life Insurance Co., Peoples Security Life Insurance Co., and Providian Life &amp; Health Insurance Co. to triple-'A' from double-'A'-plus.</p>
<p>The issuer credit and senior unsecured ratings of Providian Corp. have been raised to double-'A' from double-'A'-minus.</p>
<p>At the same time, Standard &amp; Poor's has raised its rating on Providian Corp.'s medium-term notes to double-'A' from double-'A'-minus. The ratings have been removed from CreditWatch, where they were placed in January 1997.</p>
<p>Additionally, the 'A-1'-plus commercial paper ratings of Providian Corp., Commonwealth Life Insurance, Peoples Security Life Insurance, and Providian Life &amp; Health Insurance have been affirmed.</p>
<p>Also, the double-'A' minus preferred stock rating of Providian LLC, guaranteed by Providian Corp., has been affirmed and removed from CreditWatch.</p>
<p>The rating actions for the Providian group of companies reflect the recent acquisition of the group by AEGON, N.V., the Netherlands-based insurance group.</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's believes that the acquisition of the Providian group adds strategic value to the overall United States operations of AEGON.</p>
<p>In terms of pure size, the post-transaction U.S. operation, consisting of the life insurance subsidiaries of AEGON USA and the Providian companies, will be among the 10 largest insurance organizations in the country, measured by assets.</p>
<p>The businesses of the two groups are both complementary and supplementary to one another. Both groups have substantial home service businesses, which, while challenged to grow on a direct basis, are expected to benefit from economies of scale as the two are merged into the second-largest U.S. home service operation.</p>
<p>Complementary benefits will be found in the merger of the accumulation businesses, where the Providian companies will bring their GIC and synthetic GIC products to the existing offerings of the AEGON USA companies.</p>
<p>Providian has a well established niche in direct marketing distribution, which has generated total premiums in excess of $650 million in each of the last three years; this will further diversify AEGON USA's distribution capabilities.</p>
<p>In addition, the company expects to achieve annual expensive savings of $100 million by the end of the third full year of operations.</p>
<p>AEGON is one of the ten largest insurance groups in the world, with substantial business positions in the Netherlands, the U.K., and the U.S., whose principal subsidiaries already carry triple-'A' ratings from Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
<p>These ratings reflect Standard &amp; Poor's belief that those international business positions are exceptionally strong, that the earnings of the group have grown consistently over the last five years, and that the group as a whole has excellent capitalization, with adjusted capital covering requirements by a superior 1.9 times.</p>
<p>Although Providian has been challenged to grow its home service and asset accumulation businesses, Standard &amp; Poor's believes that there are many inherent strengths of the Providian companies, including superior capital, asset portfolios of good quality, good business positions, and adequate liquidity.</p>
<p>OUTLOOK: Stable.</p>
<p>The outlook assumes maintenance of AEGON, N.V.'s superior overall capitalization and the continuation of its strong business positions in all countries in which it operates.</p>
<p>It further assumes a steady assimilation of the Providian companies into the operations of AEGON USA, and the full realization of the financial and strategic potential cited above. Wednesday, 23 July 1997 18:29:55 ENDS  nN23207123</p>
