<p>About 300 people have been left homeless and seven people injured after heavy rains flooded a rural town in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province, a Red Cross official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a terrible storm up there last night (Wednesday) and many homes were badly damaged,&quot; Kelvin Glen told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said seven people were injured by corrugated-iron roofing which was ripped from buildings in the storm.</p>
<p>Two South African Air Force helicopters ferried Red Cross supplies of food, blankets and plastic sheeting for temporary homes to the estimated 60 families in the province.</p>
<p>The weather is expected to clear by Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Mozambique the South African Air Force is continuing rescue operations there after more than a month of floods.</p>
<p>SAAF spokeswoman Laverne Machine told Reuters 40 homes were destroyed and about 250 people left homeless after fresh floods in Mozambique's central Sofala province since Sunday.</p>
<p>A woman and a child are believed to have drowned in the floodwaters which have also caused severe damage to the busy port city of Beira.</p>
<p>&quot;The Mozambique government has again approached South Africa for assistance in distributing 300 tonnes of supplies to their flooded areas,&quot; Machine said, adding that Cyclone Lisette had been responsible for most of the freak weather on Mozambique's coast which has disrupted power supplies and blocked roads.</p>
<p>Since air force operations began in Mozambique in February its aircraft have evacuated about 1,411 people and dropped 4,500 kg (10,000 lb) of medicine, food and blankets to people living around the Pungue, Buzi and Zambezi rivers.</p>
