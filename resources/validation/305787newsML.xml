<p>The government's largest wireless phone auction ended Tuesday, with prices taking a U-turn back toward earth after 125 companies bid a total of $2.5 billion to offer a new generation of cellular service.</p>
<p>The total was down 75 percent from a similar Federal Communications Commission auction that raised $10.2 billion last May. The average price for a license to provide &quot;personal communications services,&quot; or PCS, tumbled more than 90 percent.</p>
<p>PCS technology is expected to turn the wireless phone into a mass-market product, allowing consumers to use different communications services -- such as phone, paging, fax and Internet access -- through a single handheld device.</p>
<p>The drop reflected the flood of new entrants into the wireless phone market, a dearth of new money after the sky-high prices paid at last year's PCS sale, and the smaller slice of airwaves covered by the new licenses, analysts said.</p>
<p>The top bidder this time around was a unit of No. 3 long-distance carrier Sprint Corp. It bid $544 million for 160 licenses in Chicago, Houston, and Atlanta, among other cities. The permits cover a total population of 70 million nationwide.</p>
<p>Next was a unit of long-distance giant AT&amp;T Corp., which bid $407 million for 222 licenses in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere. The licenses cover 139 million people. AT&amp;T was followed by a unit of BellSouth Corp., which bid $205 million for 39 licenses reaching nearly 12 million people in the Southeast.</p>
<p>The No. 4 bidder was OPCSE-Galloway Consortium, a consortium made up of Omnipoint Corp. of Arlinton, Va., and Galloway Entrepreneurs of Charlottesville, Va. It bid $181 million for 109 licenses.</p>
<p>The licenses will allow the companies to expand their wireless networks.</p>
<p>The FCC sold 1,479 PCS licenses nationwide in three different blocks, making this the most licenses sold at once. A third were reserved for small companies. Markets that generated the highest bidding were New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Based on the population sizes covered by the licenses, the average bid at the auction was just $3.32 a person.</p>
<p>That was down from the average bid of $39.88 at last May's &quot;C-Block&quot; sale, which was reserved for small companies. Analysts called those prices too high for companies to make much money.</p>
<p>The FCC's first PCS auction, which raised $7.7 billion and ended in March 1995, had an average bid of $15.54.</p>
<p>&quot;It's phenomenally cheaper,&quot; said Jonathan Foxman, vice president of Americall International, a Phoenix-based PCS firm that bid at the auction.</p>
<p>Mark Lowenstein, a vice president with Boston consulting firm Yankee Group Inc., called the latest prices &quot;more reflective of the current market reality.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts listed several factors behind the lower prices.</p>
<p>The airwave parcels sold, at 10 megahertz (MHz) each, were a third the size of the 30 MHz parcels sold at the two prior auctions and thus less attractive. The permits cover less geographic area.</p>
<p>Analysts also said the wireless market was getting crowded with companies holding PCS and traditional cellular licenses -- meaning less profits.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is going to be too crowded,&quot; predicted P. William Bane, a director at Mercer Management Consulting.</p>
<p>The steep prices at last year's PCS auction meant less money available this time around. &quot;The latest prices are an indication that people have run out of money,&quot; said Bane.</p>
<p>In addition, analysts said, Wall Street has not rushed to extend financing to PCS providers.</p>
