<p>Japan's economy is continuing its gradual recovery, with private demand becoming firmer, Masayuki Matsushima, director of the Bank of Japan's Research and Statistics Department, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He added that the mechanism for a self-sustainable recovery was growing stronger.  </p>
<p>&quot;The gradual economic recovery is continuing, while private demand is becoming more solid,&quot; Matsushima said.</p>
<p>&quot;The mechanism for a self-sustainable economic recovery is increasing,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He attributed the improvement in big manufacturers' business sentiment to a better environment for production.</p>
<p>For example, exports are increasing, as well as investment in machinery, and the car industry is also doing very well, Matsushima said.</p>
<p>But sentiment worsened for big non-manufacturers, partly due to a peaking out of public works spending and housing investment, he said.</p>
<p>Problem loans and increasing competition from deregulation contributed to the weaker sentiment, he said.</p>
<p>Matsushima said the impact of the consumption tax hike, recent weak stock prices, a fiscal tightening and various structural reforms are clouding the outlook.</p>
<p>However, supply and demand conditions, employment and capital investment plans are steadily improving despite some fluctuations, he said.</p>
<p>Corporate business plans for 1997/98 are also generally firm, Matsushima said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although there are some effects seen from the consumption tax hike, overall it (the economy) is firm,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>He added that the consumption tax hike to five percent from three percent on April 1 will likely affect businesses towards June.</p>
<p>The increase in exports from the weakness in the yen against the dollar has generally contributed positively to the economy, Matsushima said.</p>
<p>But an economic cycle centring on domestic private demand is steadily appearing, he said, adding that domestic demand contributed much more to company sales than external demand.</p>
<p>Pressure on businesses from various structural reforms will lessen as their content becomes clearer. Problem loans are also being addressed, Matsushima said.</p>
<p>Asked about the planned increase in capital spending by financial firms in 1997/98, he said the firms are increasing their spending to cope with stronger competition, adding that previously such spending has been dampened by the urgent need to address their bad loan problems.</p>
