<p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said on Tuesday its board decided to reduce the minimum application lots for primary issues to 200 shares from 500 shares.  </p>
<p>The market regulator said it will no longer scrutinise new issue offer documents.</p>
<p>SEBI had been vetting offer documents only of ventures in which financial institutions or banks had a 10 percent stake and the projects were appraised by them.</p>
<p>It had earlier given up vetting of rights and debt issues by firms with a three-year track record of dividend payments.</p>
<p>The market watchdog said it also decided to allow firms list their debt issues on stock exchanges before their shares are listed.  </p>
<p>The SEBI board decided to scrap the 1.0 billion rupee minimum issue size for companies to raise funds through the book building process.</p>
<p>It said issues of all sizes can opt for the book building route to raise cash.</p>
<p>SEBI said it also relaxed rules and allowed promoters to bring in their contribution in phases for large infrastructure projects where such contribution exceeded one billion rupees.</p>
<p>Earlier, the relaxation was only available to promoters whose firms had a five-year track record of consistent profits and where the premiums on the stock offer did not exceed its face value.</p>
