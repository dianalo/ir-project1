<headline>ING Barings overweight Russia, Polish equities.</headline>

<p>ING Barings is overweighting Poland and Russia in its east European equity portfolio, while the bank is neutral on Hungary and underweight the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia is a market that foreign investors will find it difficult to ignore. Valuations are attractive, political uncertainty greatly reduced from a year ago, economic performance significantly improved and the successful Russia global Eurobond deal has heightened awareness of Russian markets,&quot; Philip Poole director of emerging Europe research said in a research report.</p>
<p>Poole notes that the large gains recorded in some markets this year, the Moscow Times index is up from 134 points at the end of 1995 to 337, Hungary's BUX index has risen from 1,529 to 3,798 and Poland's WIG from 7,586 to 13,515.9, does pose the question as to whether these gains are sustainable.</p>
<p>&quot;Our view is that the internationalisation of U.S. investment portfolios and the growth of savings channelled to mutual funds have further to go and this again will be crucial for east European equity markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In Hungary, he notes that even after 1996's bull run, stocks remain attractive especially food and drinks companies Pick and Sopron and drugs company Zalakeramia.</p>
<p>In Poland, food and beverages are again favoured, Farm Food and Wedel, construction stocks Mosostal-Zabrze, Exbud and engineering stocks Elektrobudowa and Relpol.</p>
<p>In Russia stocks which are traded in American Depositary Receipt form will benefit most in the first quarter of 1997, but beyond that oil and gas companies LUKoil, Chernogorneft and Megionneftegas, telecommunications firms such as Rostelecom, MGTS and PTN as well as electricity utilities Mosenergo, Irkutskenergo and UES.</p>
<p>The Czech market has massively underperformed the rest of the region, gaining just 18 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;If foreign investors are to be persuaded to increase weightings, it will be important for the government to follow up on promises to improve the transparency of the market,&quot; ING Barings said.</p>
<p>Although underweight the market, ING Barings picks construction stocks Metrostav and CHKZ, energy utilities CEZ and EOP and engineers CKD and ZPS, telephone company SPT and drugmakers Galena and Leciva.</p>
