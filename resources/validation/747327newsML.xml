<p>South Africa's Molope Foods Ltd, which is to list on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) later this year, said on Tuesday it had acquired Grantham Integrated Food Services Group for 70 million rand from July 1.</p>
<p>Black-owned Molope also announced that it had changed its name from Molope Bakeries with immediate effect.</p>
<p>&quot;Molope Foods has today acquired all the businesses of the Grantham Integrated Foods Group with effect from July 1,&quot; managing director Sam Molope told reporters.</p>
<p>The Grantham business was started in 1978 and has grown to employ over 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>The purchase price would be settled through the issue of between 17.5 and 23.5 million Molope &quot;N&quot; shares to the Grantham vendors. The exact number of shares to be issued would be announced around August 11.</p>
<p>As a result of the acquisition Molope said its after-tax profit for the year ended June 30, 1998 was expected to exceed 30 million rand. This translates to earnings per share of between 20 and 22 cents.</p>
<p>Molope said it was ready to make its stock exchange debut but still had to decide on the timing of the listing. It would, however, be before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The group was also looking to make other acquisitions in the food sector, which would provide synergies with its existing businesses.</p>
