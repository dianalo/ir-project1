<p>* New Zealand close firmer but off highs</p>
<p>* Reserve Bank takes shine off rally</p>
<p>* Smaller companies index outperforms  </p>
<p>New Zealand share prices edged higher after hitting a fresh 32-month peak, but brokers said the Reserve Bank's warning shot helped take the shine off the rally.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 4.32 points higher at 2,325.98 but was off its peak of 2,333.75 after the Reserve Bank said there was no scope for an easing after Tuesday's better-than-expected inflation data.</p>
<p>&quot;The brakes were put on the equities market by the statement that there would be no room for further easing,&quot; Tim Koller at Hendry Hay McIntosh said.  </p>
<p>But the fact that Telecom, after its record-breaking run, gave up only one cent to NZ$7.31 said much about the market and its inherent support.</p>
<p>The Small Companies Index was again very strong, firming 50.95 points to 4,631.97, bringing its rise to 3.5 percent over the past two days.</p>
<p>Koller said that reflected an appetite for value stocks.</p>
<p>Outside the top five, Independent Newspapers firmed 30 points to NZ$6.50 and Waste Management gained 25 to $5.75.  </p>
<p>There also some large crossings, among them 5.4 million GPG shares selling at NZ$0.78, and 1.27 million Air New Zealand B shares at NZ$3.70.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall the market is very well underpinned and the Small Companies Index being up another percent today just shows the strength of the broader market,&quot; Koller said.</p>
