<p>Thailand's beleaguered stock market defied the predictions of gloom merchants on Friday, shrugging off a plunge in shares of cash-strapped Finance One to end with its best gain in seven sessions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the baht rallied against the dollar on the offshore market as speculators scrambled to cover short positions they had taken earlier this month in unsuccessful attacks on the currency.</p>
<p>The baht firmed to an intraday high of 24.840 to the U.S. dollar offshore before retreating to about 25.120/25.220, but that was still well above low on the domestic market.</p>
<p>A two-tier offshore and onshore baht market has been in place since mid-May, when the central bank beat back speculators with capital controls.</p>
<p>The SET share index, which had languished near eight-year lows all week on concerns over the failing health of the economy, ended 8.22 points or 1.47 percent higher at 566.39.</p>
<p>Finance One, once a star of the stock market but now better known for its debt and liquidity problems, dropped like a stone when it resumed trading after a three-month suspension.</p>
<p>It opened at just six baht (23 U.S. cents) compared with its last price of 23.75 baht when it was suspended pending a merger with Thai Danu Bank Plc on February 28.</p>
<p>The planned link-up, which the authorities had presented as a trailblazer solution for the woes of the country's highly leveraged finance companies, collapsed last week.</p>
<p>However, Finance One's stock recovered with other cheap blue-chips during the morning as bargain-hunters came in, ending at 7.20 baht by lunchtime.</p>
<p>Analysts had predicted that a drop in Finance One would pull the overall market lower and, according to the daily Bangkok Post, the central bank and finance ministry had prepared emergency measures to prop up the market up in case of a rout.</p>
<p>&quot;People had got overly bearish on Fin One,&quot; said Rob Collins, head of research at Asia Equity, noting that it had already changed hands at even lower prices on the unofficial &quot;grey market&quot; in the past week.</p>
<p>Traders said that with the trauma of Finance One's return to the market and Thursday's battery of economic data behind them, sentiment could improve.</p>
<p>&quot;I think with this out of the way, people think all the bad news is out in the market and have come to buy other stocks on expectations of a rebound next week,&quot; said one trader at Multi Credit Corporation.</p>
<p>The central bank on Thursday released a mixed bag of indicators. Analysts said the data showed a sustained slowdown despite improvements in the latest monthly export figures, the manufacturing production index and price stability.</p>
<p>The government is banking on 1997 economic growth of 5.9 percent, its lowest level in a decade, after 6.4 percent last year. But some private economists believe growth could be as low as three percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank of Thailand released a set of figures that provided a ray of hope for the extremely depressed economy,&quot; said IDEA Singapore. &quot;... this set of figures should help to lift up some investors' sentiment.&quot;</p>
