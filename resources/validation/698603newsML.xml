<p>Bulgaria pegged its lev currency at 1,000 to the mark on Tuesday as part of an arrangement agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to slow inflation and instil monetary discipline.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ivan Kostov said the currency board system would stabilise the economy and his government was considering issuing eurobonds once it started to take effect.</p>
<p>The currency board system bans central bank lending to the government and commercial banks and requires that levs in circulation be fully covered by foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>Bulgaria's central bank must guarantee that it will have one mark for every thousand levs in circulation, freezing the exchange rate at essentially that level.</p>
<p>&quot;Pork chops pegged&quot; said a populist headline in the 24 Hours newspaper. Douma, the daily of the opposition Socialists, warned: &quot;In practice the country will lose part of its independence&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Like everything man-made, the board may bring us the much desired success but it can surprise us with a lot of suffering,&quot; President Petar Stoyanov said in an address to the nation on Monday night. &quot;The currency board is an instrument and it all depends on how we use it.&quot;</p>
<p>Bulgarians took to the streets in January and February to protest at the economic hardship caused by seven years delay in implementing market reforms.</p>
<p>With no effective government to take rescue measures, the lev went into freefall and inflation soared. An interim government appointed in February began a crisis programme continued by Kostov's government which took office in May.</p>
<p>On the interbank market, the lev opened at 990 to 1,000 per mark in a larger spread from Monday's close, as the market tested its new levels.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the lev to trade in a 990-1,005 per mark range under the currency board as rates would depend on foreign exchange supply and demand.</p>
<p>They said that with supply outweighing demand they had bought marks below the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) bid of 995 levs to sell back to the central bank later.</p>
<p>When demand is higher they will buy marks at 1,000 levs from the central bank and then sell them to foreign currency bidders at above 1,000 levs.</p>
<p>Trade in dollars and other currencies will depend on the domestic lev/mark rate and the international rate of the currency to the mark. The lev opened in a wider range at 1,730-1,740 per dollar against Monday's close at 1,733-1,738.</p>
<p>The head of Bulgaria's Chamber of Commerce, Bozhidar Bozhinov, told 24 Hours that businesses were confident the currency board would bring stability and regulate the market.</p>
<p>&quot;However, for the success of the currency board, the banking system should start working, clear customs and tax regulations should be imposed, and a normal interest rate policy should be followed,&quot; Bozhinov said.</p>
<p>The government hopes to fund part of a budget deficit of 6.2 percent of GDP with $320 million in proceeds from privatisation. Borrowing on external markets to service the three trillion lev ($1.8 billion) domestic debt and fund a restrictive budget is one option being considered.</p>
<p>&quot;In principle we are discussing the idea of placing eurobonds, more as a signal that things in Bulgaria have changed and that risk has decreased and Bulgaria is a country worthy of investors' confidence,&quot; Kostov told Reuters and Reuters Financial Television in an interview.</p>
<p>Bulgaria's economy has been subject to many of the system's restrictions for the past couple of months. Inflation has slowed and exchange rates have stabilised in anticipation.</p>
<p>Martin Zaimov, head of the BNB Issue Department, said on Monday the bank would start the currency board with 2.7 billion marks of gross foreign exchange reserves to cover liabilities of 2.2 trillion levs.</p>
<p>&quot;We have sufficient cover for our lev liabilities,&quot; said Zaimov, who is also a BNB deputy governor. &quot;The aggregate amount is 2.7 billion German marks and that consists of gold, foreign currency and foreign securities.&quot;</p>
<p>Currency boards have been used to repair crumbling financial systems and curb inflation in countries such as Argentina, Lithuania and Estonia. The system has also been proposed for Bosnia.</p>
