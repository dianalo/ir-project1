<title>FINLAND: Helsinki ends higher but confused as Lebed to go.</title>
<headline>Helsinki ends higher but confused as Lebed to go.</headline>
<dateline>HELSINKI 1996-10-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares hit year-highs intra session and ended on stronger ground, but late reports that Russian security chief Alexander Lebed was sacked by president Boris Yeltsin left confusion, brokers said.</p>
<p>The HEX index ended up 0.63 percent, finally scraping to a new closing year-high of 2,236.1 with volume a sturdy 400 million markka, about 24 percent of it in Nokia which closed up 4.80 markka at 212.80.</p>
<p>The HEX's previous year-high was 2,226.6 set on October 8.</p>
<p>But brokers said the underlying trend should still be up.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend is still good ... but there was the Lebed news, and we don't know if it's good or bad,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Interim results from UPM-Kymmene and Metsa-Serla offered no positive surprises to those hoping for a fast recovery in forestries, but the shares rose and stayed in positive territory as the January-August profits were partly better than expected.</p>
<p>Unless Wall Street upsets investors, more gains were seen possible, particularly if Merita resumed a recent rally, but some warned that bulls could soon hit the edge of the pen.</p>
<p>&quot;This is pretty much a bull market ... it looks like it always does before it halts completely,&quot; said one broker. &quot;Shares are vulnerable now if interest rates rise,&quot; he said.</p>
