<p>A spokesman for Northern Ireland's Protestant &quot;Loyalist&quot; gunmen suggested on Tuesday that their 22-month ceasefire was at risk because of the failure of their IRA foes to restore their own ceasefire.</p>
<p>David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party said in an article for the Belfast Telegraph that Loyalist gunmen now believed there was little chance that the IRA would renew a ceasefire it ended in February with a big bomb attack in London.</p>
<p>&quot;The time has long since passed for the hope of a restored IRA ceasefire, &quot; said Ervine, a leading spokesman for Loyalists who take their name from allegiance to the British crown.</p>
<p>Ervine, whose party is close to the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force guerrillas, said Loyalists and Unionists, who want the province to remain British, felt threatened by the Irish Republican Army's continued war on British rule.</p>
<p>&quot;The basis of the UVF/Red Hand Commando thinking at the time is for the survival of the Unionist population and their way of life,&quot; wrote Ervine.</p>
<p>The Red Hand is another Loyalist guerrilla organisation committed to fight what it sees as a threat, supported by the Irish government, to end British rule and reunite the province with the predominantly Catholic Irish republic.</p>
<p>Ervine's statement was certain to raise the political temperature in Northern Ireland again in the run-up to the resumption in Belfast on September 9 of faltering Anglo-Irish peace talks supposed to reconcile all sides.</p>
<p>The talks include Ervine's PUP but exclude Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, becauuse of the IRA's decision to return to war in February with a wave of bomb attacks in Britain and one on a British army base in Germany.</p>
<p>The British and Irish governments hope that if the talks progress well, the IRA's governing Army Council might call a new ceasefire to get Sinn Fein invited and the topic of reunited Ireland put on the talks' agenda.</p>
<p>Ervine was sharply critical of the Irish government which he accused of trying to get Sinn Fein included in the talks without meeting the precondition of a ceasefire.</p>
<p>&quot;Elements of the Irish government and opposition have felt it necessary to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Provos (IRA) in relation to talks without a ceasefire.</p>
<p>&quot;I have never known the level of hatred for the Irish government to be as severe as it is now. Loyalists see the Irish government as being wholly dubious and I don't think that augurs well,&quot; said Ervine.</p>
<p>Irish Prime Minister John Bruton told reporters in Dublin that he was ready to talk to Ervine or any other Loyalist figure to persuade him of the Irish government's determination to be even-handed to Loyalists and Irish nationalists alike.</p>
<p>This weekend is the second anniversary of the IRA's August 31 ceasefire which raised hopes of a new deal for the troubled province after the loss of 3,200 lives in 25 years.</p>
<p>Britain says the surrender of IRA and Loyalist arms must be part of any peace talks but the IRA says it will accept no preconditions and dismisses talk of an arms handover as ludicrous.</p>
