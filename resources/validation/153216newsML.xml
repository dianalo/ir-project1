<p>Kazakhstan's grain harvest will probably fall far below official forecasts, industry sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Specialists at the Academy of Agricultural Sciences said 1996 net grain output in the former Soviet republic would be 11 million tonnes, well below official forecasts of 13-14 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Grain in cleaned weight will total 11 million tonnes this year,&quot; one of the specialists said.</p>
<p>The government has periodically revised downward its outlook for 1996 output. Early predictions of 18 million net tonnes were cut to 16.5 million and then to 13-14 million last month.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister in charge of agriculture Zhanybek Karibzhanov said earlier this month Kazakhstan hoped to export at least five to six million tonnes of grain from the 1996 crop.</p>
<p>But agriculture specialists said Kazakhstan could have little to export and could see domestic demand outstrip supply.</p>
<p>&quot;For them to export this much, they need at least a net harvest of 13-14 million tonnes,&quot; said independent agriculture specialist Andrei Sizov of SovEcon Ltd in Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;They are not going to get that,&quot; he said, adding rains which swamped Siberian crops also affected northern Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan plans to use about 2.5 million tonnes of grain for seed this year. Three million tonnes are used for food grain, while five million are fed to livestock.</p>
<p>One million tonnes will be used as barter payment to farmers, while two million tonnes go to state reserves.</p>
<p>The academy specialists said this would total 13.5 million tonnes, or a 2.5 million tonne deficit against the 11 million forecast. &quot;We're going to be living from hand to mouth,&quot; one of the specialists said.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan's net, drought-hit 1995 harvest was officially 10 million tonnes. But independent specialists have said actual output was probably three million tonnes higher and producers under-reported output to hoard stocks.</p>
<p>The academy specialists said disruptions in Russian electricity supplies to northern Kazakhstan caused grain on some farms to spoil because it could not be dried and put into silos in time. And near-drought in the south and west also hit crops, pushing yields in some places down to 0.2 tonnes per hectare.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan's harvest is nearly over and the government will announce a final figure in the first 10 days of November.</p>
<p>Nearly 70 percent of Russia's wheat and wheat flour imports came from Kazakhstan over the 1995/96 crop marketing year. Russia, facing its own poor net harvest of around 70 million tonnes this year, is likely to continue to seek Kazakh supplies.</p>
<p>But grain sources in Moscow said some small lots of Kazakh grain were moving fast to other Central Asian buyers such as Turkmenistan and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>&quot;Kazakhstan may have something left over to sell, but the Central Asian states are moving in fast,&quot; said Alexander Yushik of Russia's Grain Union. --Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520</p>
