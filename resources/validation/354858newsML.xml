<title>USA: PepsiCo international beverage volume down.</title>
<headline>PepsiCo international beverage volume down.</headline>
<dateline>PURCHASE, N.Y. 1997-02-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>PepsiCo Inc said Tuesday its international beverage volume fell nine percent in the 1996 fourth quarter and two percent for the full year.</p>
<p>Roger Enrico, chairman and chief executive officer, described the declines as &quot;dramatic.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the losses stemmed in part from an accumulation of unproductive investments in markets and in beverage-related activities outside the company's core business.</p>
<p>PepsiCo officials were not available for further comment.  </p>
<p>The company, reporting lower earnings from on-going operations for the 1996 fourth quarter and full year, said its international beverage operations are measured in bottled case sales (BCS).</p>
<p>It said it lost $404 million in its international beverage operations for the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $3 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>PepsiCo said the international beverage losses included higher than normal expenses of about $80 million from fourth-quarter balance sheet readjustments, as well as unusual charges of $186 million related to restructuring.  </p>
<p>The company said its Pepsi-Cola North America operations reported a 14 percent profit rise for 1996 on a four percent rise in sales.</p>
<p>It said its Frito-Lay North America operations reported a 12 percent profit rise in 1996 on a 13 percent sales rise.</p>
<p>PepsiCo said its restaurant operations had a sales decline of one percent for 1996 and two percent for the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The company said earlier this month it would spin off the $11 billion worth of restaurant operations.</p>
<p>PepsiCo shares were off 7/8 at 33-1/4 in early trading.</p>
