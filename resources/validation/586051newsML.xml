<p>Presumed guerrillas from the Maoist Shining Path fought police in a poor Lima suburb early on Thursday then set off a car bomb that injured 10 officers and caused widespread damage, police said.</p>
<p>The guerrillas, who had earlier promised to turn this month into &quot;bloody May,&quot; detonated 88 pounds (40 kgs) of dynamite from a van that pulled up near the police station at about 3:20 a.m. local time (0820 GMT), police sources said.</p>
<p>Minutes before, they attacked the station from the rear, engaging policemen in a firefight and letting off small detonations, witnesses said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was gunfire first,&quot; restaurant worker Enrique Baltazar told Reuters. &quot;That woke me up, and I saw a vehicle with smoke coming out. I knew it was a car bomb, but it was too late. Everything came down on me - doors, windows and even part of the vehicle.&quot;</p>
<p>Propaganda was found nearby reading: &quot;Long live the 17th anniversary of the popular war - genocide armed forces and police forces&quot; and &quot;Long live the street-vendors' struggle!&quot;</p>
<p>The pamphlets, signed with Shining Path's formal name, The Communist Party of Peru (PCP), referred to the group's May 1980 launching of its insurgency, and recent violent clashes between police and thousands of street-vendors being evicted from their positions in downtown Lima.</p>
<p>The blast, in the heavily populated Ate Vitarte district, blew out windows and doors in buildings all around the police station, and also damaged nearby vehicles.</p>
<p>The motor of the van, which was totally destroyed, was found one square away, witnesses said. A huge hole in the road marked the site of the blast.</p>
<p>It was the highest-profile guerrilla attack in Peru since the bloody end to the four-month hostage crisis provoked by the smaller Marxist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA).</p>
<p>According to an anti-terrorist police document obtained by Reuters this week, Shining Path had warned it would mark May with attacks as a way of seizing back the initiative after being overshadowed by the MRTA.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Gen. Cesar Saucedo, inspecting the scene of the attack, insisted however: &quot;This does not represent a backward step&quot; in the war on guerrilla violence. Police were alert and sought to repel the attack, he added.</p>
<p>Shining Path was weakened by the 1992 capture of its leader, Abimael Guzman, but has been regrouping in the last year and remains stronger than the MRTA despite that group's international notoriety after the hostage crisis.</p>
<p>The MRTA, which held 72 captives for 126 days at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, has also warned of reprisal attacks. Peruvian troops burst into the residence April 22 to kill the 14 rebel hostage-takers and release all but one of their captives.</p>
<p>Car bombs have been a common mode of attack in Peru during 17 years of guerrilla violence that has cost at least 30,000 lives and $25 billion in infrastructure damage.</p>
