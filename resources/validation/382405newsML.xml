<p>**  National bourse index up 1.22 pct at provisional close</p>
<p>--  </p>
<p>Renewed speculative buying in frontline stocks drove Bombay bourses to a bullish close on Monday with growing optimism ahead of the month-end federal budget stoking the rally, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the traditional pre-budget rally. Speculative activity has picked up,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign brokerage.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram is due to announce the budget for fiscal 1997/98 (April-March) on February 28. &quot;There was some foreign buying, but not very aggressive. We expect the market to register gains from current levels,&quot; said chief dealer Sanjay Vaid at local firm Lloyds Securites.  </p>
<p>Traders said market activity was mostly focussed on index heavyweight stocks as speculators built up positions at the start of the new account at the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;The present market levels are quite attractive buying opportunities. The undertone is definitely firm,&quot; Vaid said.</p>
<p>Shares of Bombay Suburban &amp; Electric Supply (BSES) jumped 16.0 rupees, or 4.28 percent, to 250.0 amidst volumes of 913,945 shares traded at the BSE. Dealers said renewed local and foreign buying led to the sharp price rise.</p>
<p>Most participants expect the market to show volatile movement in the run-up to the budget.  </p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda said on Monday that a minimum alternate tax (MAT) proposed by the Finance Minister Chidambaram in his last budget was not the only factor that had depressed stockmarket sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;MAT is not the only reason,&quot; Deve Gowda told a meeting of about 900 delegates attending an infrastructure seminar in Bombay. &quot;There are so many other reasons also.&quot;</p>
<p>But Gowda refused to elaborate further, saying that it was too close to the next budget for him to make any comments.</p>
<p>Reliance rose 4.25 rupees to 277.75, SBI 8.75 to 296.0.</p>
