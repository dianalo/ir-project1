<p>Civil Aviation staff will join on Friday the strike by Greek seamen that has left Greek ships tied to ports.</p>
<p>Civil servants are expected to join soon as they are all protesting against the state's tight budget and a contained incomes policy, union represenatives said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers will stage work stoppages on Friday and Sunday, from 12:00 to 16:00 GMT and flights at Greek airports are expected to be disrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;I am convinced that the new bill does not include wage and bonus cuts for Civil Aviation Authority (YPA) employees. Actually, it might even provide for salary raises,&quot; Dionysis Kalofonos, the commanding officer of YPA said.</p>
<p>It is possible that YPA unions have misunderstood the terms of the bill, he added.</p>
<p>Kalofonos said he will be in constant talks with the finance ministry until late Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow we will know if the strikes and work stoppages are still going to take place. My personal opinion is that they will be cancelled after YPA union representatives become convinced that the bill will not harm their incomes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, YPA's electrical engineers union has announced 24-hour strikes lasting from Friday 17 to Monday 20, to protest against the bill's terms for public sector wages.</p>
<p>The Panhellenic Seamen's Federation (PNO) announced on Tuesday the renewal of its strike for another 48 hours. It will take place on January 15 and 16.</p>
<p>&quot;Our main demands are aimed at the solution of the severe unemployment problem we are faced with, at the provision of higher pensions and better insurance plans and at being favourably treated in terms of taxation,&quot; Antonis Dalakogiorgos, a member of the PNO board said.</p>
<p>He added that strikes affect all ship types which use Greek crews. No port officials were available for comment.</p>
<p>Another labour union, the Supreme Administrative Council of Civil Servants (ADEDY) announced a strike for February 3 and 4.</p>
<p>&quot;Our demands concern 1997 wages that do not correspond to ADEDY's requests, taxation issues and the establishment of collective trade negotiations for civil servants,&quot; Costas Kollias, the Secretary General of ADEDY told Reuters. --Margarita Sotiropoulou, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
