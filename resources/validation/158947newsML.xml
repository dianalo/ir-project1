<text>
<p>Toronto stocks rallied to their 49th record close of 1996 on Wednesday, propelled by higher corporate profits and firmer bonds.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Composite Index added 25.77 points to new closing high of 5590.80 after earlier setting an intraday peak of 5598.35. Trading was brisk with 112 million shares exchanging hands worth C$1.8 billion ($1.3 billion).</p>
<p>Consumer products, gold, communications and banks led 10 of 14 sub-groups ahead. Sharply higher profits at beverage and entertainment giant Seagram Co. Ltd. powered a 110-point gain in consumer products.</p>
<p>Advancing stocks outnumbered declines 517 to 419 with 290 issues unchanged.</p>
<p>Equities also received a lift from bonds which ended firmer on a strong Canadian dollar and renewed investor interest in Canada's bond market fundamentals.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, analysts said the TSE's performance may be restrained by continued weakness in commodity prices such as oil, forest products and precious metals.</p>
<p>&quot;Those key groups have been weak and heading into the next four to six weeks they probably will continue to be weak due to tax loss related pressure,&quot; said Calgary-based equity strategist Josef Schachter.</p>
<p>--- HOT STOCKS ---</p>
<p>* Seagram jumped 1.40 to 50.60 on 490,000 shares after reporting higher first-quarter earnings and a dividend increase.</p>
<p>* Getchell Gold Corp. was the top gainer, soaring 4 to 61 after posting higher third quarter profits.</p>
<p>* Among other gold players, Bre-X Minerals Ltd. sank 1.25 to 22.40 on 1.8 million shares amid concerns about Bre-X's strategic alliance with an Indonesian firm in its huge gold discovery in Indonesia.</p>
<p>* Inmet Mining Corp. led heavy traders, closing down 0.30 to 8.05 on 4.5 million shares. Inmet extended its recent decline after taking major writedowns this week.</p>
