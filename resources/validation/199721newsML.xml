<p>Australian mass murderer Martin Bryant showed no mercy as he hunted down some of his 35 victims at Port Arthur in April, executing a six-year-old girl as she hid behind a tree, a court heard on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Prosecutors outlined chilling details of the massacre to the Tasmanian Supreme Court as part of a sentencing hearing for Bryant, who made a surprise decision two weeks ago to confess to the murders and reverse his earlier pleas of innocence.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Damian Bugg told the court he had difficulty describing in unemotional terms the carnage unleashed by Bryant at a popular tourist spot in this southern island state.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no doubt at his...desire to cause maximum carnage,&quot; Bugg said, adding Bryant had yet to give any reason for the horrifying crimes he committed on April 28. Bugg asked the judge to hand down a life sentence with no parole.</p>
<p>Relatives of some of the dead and massacre survivors wept in the windowless courtroom's small public gallery as Bugg recounted the full details of the murders, and the bravery of a few people who suffered serious injury to rescue others.</p>
<p>Bryant meanwhile looked relaxed in the dock, as he did in his previous two court appearances, smiling and smirking during proceedings and turning to meet the stares of distraught people close by in the public gallery, separated by a sheet of glass.</p>
<p>Walter Mikac, who lost his wife and two young daughters in the massacre, was in tears as Bugg told of how Nanette Mikac pleaded with the gunman: &quot;Please don't hurt my babies!&quot;</p>
<p>Bryant demanded three times that Nanette Mikac get on her knees before shooting her in the head and firing twice on three-year-old Madeline, who had been in her mother's arms. Bryant then turned on Alannah Mikac, 6, as she hid behind a tree.</p>
<p>&quot;He then moved to the tree and shot her at near contact point...,&quot; Bugg said. &quot;The gun was pushed into the child's neck and fired.&quot;</p>
<p>Bugg also told of how one man visiting Port Arthur, a former penal colony and popular tourist attraction, found his wife dying in the historic site's car park. She had been shot in the buttocks then finished off by Bryant with a shot to her back.</p>
<p>Crouched over his wife, Neville Quin turned to find Bryant shooting at him. Quin fled onto an empty tourist bus and Bryant followed, finding him hiding behind a seat. &quot;No one gets away from me&quot;, Bryant said before firing.</p>
<p>Quin flinched and the bullet struck his neck but he survived, Bugg said.</p>
<p>Bryant's &quot;trail of destruction&quot; had begun at a guesthouse near Port Arthur around midday, when he shot dead its two owners. Then at a crowded cafe inside the historic site 20 people died within two minutes, the court heard.</p>
<p>&quot;It's more appropriate to term what he did in that cafe as slaughter,&quot; Bugg said, quoting survivors as saying Bryant walked from table to table shooting people in the head, laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;Bryant was not saying anything, but he appeared to be laughing in an aggressive way, rather than in an amused way,&quot; said Bugg, quoting an unnamed survivor.</p>
<p>One of the first to be killed, Malaysian tourist Moh Yee William Ng, was still holding a dinner knife in his hand when police later arrived at the scene to gather evidence.</p>
<p>Bugg played a video recording taken by a tourist outside the cafe when the first series of shots rang out from the cafe. &quot;In those 15 seconds, 12 people were dead...,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They had little opportunity to react, let alone escape.&quot;</p>
<p>The hearing continues on Wednesday.</p>
