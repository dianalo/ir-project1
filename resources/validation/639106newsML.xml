<p>Former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar deliberately tried to throw premier league soccer matches in return for large sums of money, a British court heard on Thursday.</p>
<p>Prosecutor David Calvert Smith opened his case by telling the jury that Grobbelaar and three co-defendants had been involved in a scheme to rig matches for an Asian betting syndicate over a number of years.</p>
<p>Grobbelaar was paid 40,000 pounds ($65,000) for throwing a match against Newcastle in November 1993 when playing for Liverpool and also tried to influence games after he moved to Southampton in 1994, he said.</p>
<p>Grobbelaar, former Wimbledon and Aston Villa striker John Fashanu, former Wimbledon goalkeeper Hans Segers and Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim all deny the charges.</p>
<p>Grobbelaar is also charged with taking 2,000 pounds ($3,300) as an inducement to rig games.</p>
<p>If convicted the four face up to seven years in jail and an unlimited fine. The first attempt to try them ended in early March when the jury failed to agree a verdict on any of the charges.</p>
<p>Calvert Smith said Lim and Fashanu acted as middlemen for the syndicate while Grobbelaar and Segers -- who at the time was playing for Wimbledon -- were trying to let in goals on the pitch.</p>
<p>&quot;If you are a betting man, and wish to tip the odds in your favour, and you are going to approach a single player, the goalkeeper is the most obvious person to approach, because he can have the most dramatic and direct effect upon the result of a match,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If a goalkeeper (allows) the ball to roll through his legs, without making any attempt to stop it, (a) he wouldn't be picked next week, and (b) everybody would realise he was up to something, so there is a limit to what can be achieved.</p>
<p>&quot;However, goalkeepers do make genuine mistakes and therefore the odd deliberate mistake may escape notice.&quot;</p>
<p>Calvert Smith said chief prosecution witness Christopher Vincent, a former friend and business associate of Grobbelaar, would testify that the goalkeeper had admitted working for the syndicate.</p>
<p>The confessions were recorded secretly on a videotape that Vincent made in coordination with the Sun tabloid newspaper, which broke the story in November 1994.</p>
