<headline>Silver OTC options trade perks up before expiry.</headline>

<p>Business in silver OTC options has perked up since spot prices sagged but no fireworks were expected for Thursday's expiry, dealers said.</p>
<p>Volatilities have failed to rise and some grantors have been wary of upside exposure, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been a bit of interest in silver over the last few days,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>When spot prices broke below the key $5.00 level last week, the market saw buying in short-term $4.90 puts, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The vols have stayed low. You could buy the puts for about 17 percent,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Dealers, however, were divided on recent activity, with some seeing business in $4.75 October puts and others seeing a shift to calls.</p>
<p>One European dealer said he had seen buying in longer term calls, from three-month to one-year dates.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are seeing now is a bit more call buying -- people are playing the rebound,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Another dealer said that players have been wary of granting on the upside.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody wanted to sell any $5.00 calls at the end of this month, it seems to indicate that people are expecting it to jump back up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;My impression is a general consensus is that everybody is waiting for it to come back up again and it will be sooner rather than later,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Implied volatilities have been stable with October at-the-money options bid at 14.5 to 15.0 percent, December at 16.0 to 16.5 percent, March at 17.0 to 17.5 percent and September 1997 at 18.5 percent.</p>
<p>Open interest was seen centred on $4.90 and $5.00 and the spot price was expected to remain trapped between the two prices until after the expiry, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gold options activity has been slow, with volatilities still near historic low levels, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold is dead. No interest whatever,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>No concentration of open interest was seen, but instead spread from $380 to $385, leading to a dull expiry.</p>
<p>&quot;Since it has been very, very quiet people have been playing the gamma over the past two weeks and I think everyone has a small position on every dollar from $380 to $385,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The vols are so low the sellers are having to sell every dollar rather than $380 or $385,&quot; another said.</p>
<p>There was still some interest in end-of-year calls, with one dealer citing recent interest in November $390 call options at 5.4/6.3 percent and December $400 options at 5.2/5.6 percent.</p>
<p>At-the-money implied volatilities for October were bid at 4.75 to 5.00 percent, December at 5.25 percent, March at 6.0 to 6.25 and September 1997 at 7.0 percent.</p>
