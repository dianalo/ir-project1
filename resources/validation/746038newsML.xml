<headline>ING Barings urges overweight in emerging markets.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>ING Barings analysts recommended overweight positions in emerging market stocks and bonds for the third quarter.</p>
<p>In a July analysis, the firm said, &quot;Our contention remains that the global economic backdrop will be supportive for financial markets.&quot;</p>
<p>ING Barings was cautious on Southeast Asia and more bullish on Latin American and European emerging markets, such as Russia.  Following are some highlights from the report:  </p>
<p>-- &quot;We continue to advocate an overweight exposure both to emerging market equities and bonds. Our models suggest an overweighting of 50 percent over benchmark for emerging market equities relative to their developed counterparts.&quot;</p>
<p>-- ING Barings keeps a &quot;structural bias&quot; toward emerging markets in Europe. Reforms and solid earnings in Latin America could presage further gains.</p>
<p>-- The near-term outlook for Southeast Asia is mixed. The devaluation of the Thai baht is a plus for the region, but other currencies -- especially those of the Philippines and Malaysia -- are at risk from volatility.  </p>
<p>-- Worldwide, the improvement in inflation is keeping real interest rates high.  A two-year period of dollar strength is drawing to a close.</p>
<p>-- &quot;With only a few exceptions, developed equity markets have reached valuations that look stretched in a historic context.&quot;</p>
<p>-- The firm said Japan's Nikkei index was unlikely to move substantially higher amid domestic fiscal tightening.</p>
<p>-- In developed markets, ING Barings recommended an overweight position, or 70 percent, for equities. Bonds were earmarked at 25 percent and the remainder was cash.</p>
<p>The report was written by John Reynolds, the global head of research and chief investment strategist; Matthew Merritt, senior global investment strategist; strategist Shaun Roache; and analyst Malti Gangadia.</p>
