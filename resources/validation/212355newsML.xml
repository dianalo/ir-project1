<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in the Philippines late on Saturday pledging America's commitment to stability and growth in the Pacific Rim so the region will be &quot;stronger than ever&quot; entering the next century.</p>
<p>Clinton arrived in Manila with a dual mission -- to participate in the annual gathering of leaders of the 18-nation Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and to hold private talks with his counterparts from China, Japan and South Korea.</p>
<p>In the midst of a 12-day trip to the Asia-Pacific region, Clinton used his weekly radio address, broadcast in the United States, to say he was enjoying the &quot;warmth and hospitality of the people of this diverse region&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;America's involvement and influence here helps to provide the stability, to promote the economic progress, to encourage the cooperation on many fronts...that benefits all Americans,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Clinton flew to the Philippines on Air Force One following a five-day stop in Australia that combined business with pleasure. He was to visit Thailand before returning to the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;With partners and friends like the nations I'm visiting, we're going to enter the 21st Century stronger than ever,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Clinton enters diplomatically challenging waters by meeting Chinese President Jiang Zemin to discuss ways to ease tensions between the two nations and develop a durable relationship.</p>
<p>White House spokesman David Johnson said Clinton intended to use the talks, his fourth with the Chinese leader, &quot;to construct a relationship that is durable based on common interests.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton plans separate meetings Sunday with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and South Korean President Kim Young-sam.</p>
<p>Fresh from his November 5 re-election victory, Clinton is determined to press his vision of relations among Asia-Pacific nations, particularly by improving relations with Bejing.</p>
<p>Aides said he intended to explore reviving an idea raised in April for talks among the United States, China and North and South Korea on defusing tension on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>In his talks with China's leader he also plans to stress that the United States has not revived its old Cold War strategy of containment against Beijing.</p>
<p>In July, Washington and Canberra signed a defence agreement aimed at bolstering security ties by upgrading joint U.S.- Australia military facilities, the establishment of a small marine base in Australia and boosting joint training.</p>
<p>The move prompted Beijing to accuse Australia of being used by Washington as part of a containment pincer with Japan.</p>
<p>The APEC meeting, which Clinton elevated four years ago from the ministerial level to the head of government, is not expected to produce dramatic breakthroughs, according to senior U.S. officials. &quot;We hope to deal with real nuts and bolts issues,&quot; one official said.</p>
