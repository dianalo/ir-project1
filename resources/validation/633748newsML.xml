<p>Japan industries expect the economy to improve in the second half of this business year, citing rises in sales, profits, capital spending as well as more hiring as encouraging signs, the government said in a report on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Economic Planning Agency said while many industries were still somewhat uncertain about the economy, a healthy telecommunications sector was helping business, and consumption was expected to recover in the latter half of fiscal 1997/98.</p>
<p>Most sectors expect consumer spending, currently weak after the sales tax rose to five percent from three percent on April 1, to recover after June.</p>
<p>An end to special income tax cuts, another of the government's measures to tighten fiscal spending, was expected to push down sales by an average of just under one percent in most sectors, the report said.</p>
<p>Consumer sentiment was seen as the biggest factor affecting the economy. Other factors include capital spending, business sentiment, deregulation and foreign exchange movements.  </p>
<p>Most sectors, with the exception of the construction industry, expected increases in sales and profits this business year on plans to open new stores, increase sales of new products and cut costs.</p>
<p>The car industry expects a 2.9 percent rise in sales and current profits to increase 3.2 percent, noting that expected strong sales of recreational vehicles, a weaker yen compared with last year and low stocks overseas should help business.</p>
<p>The convenience store sector predicted a rise in sales of around 10 percent and current profits to climb 10 percent on the back of new products and new stores.</p>
<p>The household electronic goods industry forecast a sales increase of six to 10 percent and a rise in current profits of 21 percent after cost-cutting measures and the opening of new stores.</p>
<p>The electronic machinery sector expects sales to rise five percent and current profits to increase 11 percent, riding the wave of a healthy telecommunications sector and an expected recovery in the semiconductor market.  </p>
<p>Capital spending for all sectors except construction was expected to rise an average of nine percent from a year earlier in this business year, the report said.</p>
<p>The car industry planned to spend the most, forecasting a rise of 23 percent from a year earlier. The household electronic goods sector predicted a rise in capital spending of 16 percent, while the electronic machinery sector saw a rise of four to five percent.</p>
<p>The convenience store sector predicted a rise of 10 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Much of the capital spending would be focused on telecommunications investment, but many industries said they would also be investing in upgrading their offices and new products.</p>
<p>All sectors, except for the construction industry, also said they planned to hire more staff in the 1998/99 fiscal year. Manufacturers said they planned to hire technical staff and researchers while the distribution related industries said they planned to hire more sales staff.</p>
