<title>ROMANIA: Bucharest stocks mixed, volumes keep low.</title>
<headline>Bucharest stocks mixed, volumes keep low.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1996-08-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bucharest shares drifted without clear direction on Tuesday, with volumes keeping light and turnover staying close to the previous 68 million lei level.</p>
<p>Volume was 11,733 shares on turnover of 66.2 million lei.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest is thin and turnover will probably be around 100 million lei till the market turns more liquid,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The market was expected to become more liquid in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>&quot;With the completion of distribution of shareholders' certificates under the mass selloff scheme more people will bring listed shares to trading,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Most of the 13 companies traded on the Bursa de Valori Bucuresti were included in a mass privatisation programme which offered adult Romanians up to 60 percent of some 4,000 state companies in exchange for vouchers and coupons.</p>
<p>The bulk of the new shareholders are expected to rush to the stock exchange to sell shares.</p>
<p>&quot;There are stocks for which demand has almost always been high so the new offer will find a match,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, fertiliser maker Azomures SA remained a top performer by value traded, taking 43 percent of turnover. It closed slightly lower at 12,000 lei from 12,100.</p>
<p>Artrom SA engineer dominated the bourse in share volume. Some 4,600 Artrom shares changed hands. The stock closed 50 lei stronger at 2,600.</p>
<p>Tuesday's novelty was an extension of continuous trading by one and a half hours after a pre-market pricing session was cut to half an hour. Traders said the move was beneficial.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have an order to fulfil and you find no client you surely have more time now to try to find one,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>The unofficial VAB Index -- a value-weighted index of all stocks computed by  Vanguard SA securities -- was 0.66 percent higher from the previous session, closing at 373.5 points. Its base was 1,000 points when it was created last November.</p>
