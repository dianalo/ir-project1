<p>Hungarian farmers blocked roads for a third day on Wednesday in a protest over tax changes despite reported progress in talks with the government.</p>
<p>National police spokeswoman Eva Kiss said demonstrations were going on at various locations across the country but she did not yet know how many farmers were participating.</p>
<p>The farmers have blocked roads throughout the country with tractors, ploughs, harvesters and other equipment since Monday.</p>
<p>They are protesting at the end of an exemption from social security contributions from January 1 and new requirements to provide documentation for tax purposes.</p>
<p>The protests continued into their third and final scheduled day despite reports of progress in talks held by farmers and a government delegation on Tuesday in the central Hungarian city of Kiskoros.</p>
<p>The farmers and the government delegation headed by Finance Ministry state secretary Tibor Draskovics &quot;reached a common position on about 80 percent of disputed questions&quot;, the Hungarian news agency MTI reported.</p>
<p>The three main topics covered in the talks were tax regulations, social security payment obligations and full-time farmer certificates, MTI said.</p>
<p>The farm protests have caused some traffic delays but police generally have managed to route motorists around the blockades and there have been no reports of violence.</p>
