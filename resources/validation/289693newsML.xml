<p>A major oil spill from a sunken Russian tanker grew bigger and crept closer to Japan's northern coast on Monday, defying efforts by ships and helicopters to break up the pollution before it reached rich fishing grounds.</p>
<p>Bad weather hampered both clean up efforts and drove the 10-kilometre (six-mile) wide spill faster and faster towards a stretch of picturesque rocky coastline famed for its shrimp, crabs and women divers known as &quot;Ama&quot;.</p>
<p>A Maritime Safety Agency (MSA) spokesman said the spill, already described as the nation's second-biggest, was growing larger as oil was now seeping from ruptured tanks in the stern of the vessel where the majority of the ship's 19,000 tonnes (133,000 barrels) of heavy fuel oil was stored.</p>
<p>It had earlier been estimated that only 3,700 tonnes (26,000 barrels) of oil had escaped from ruptured tanks in the ship's bow when the 13,157-tonne Nakhodka was torn in two in stormy seas in the Sea of Japan last Thursday.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the bow and oil slick surrounding it could wash on to shores on Japan's largest island of Honshu as early as Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The bow and the oil slicks around it are moving faster than we had anticipated. The bow of the tanker is now around 30 km (20 miles) from the coast of Fukui Prefecture, moving at around two km an hour straight for the shoreline,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the weather continues like this it'll be very difficult to stop,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Late on Monday, planes which flew over the area confirmed the MSA officials' worst fears -- oil was now leaking from ruptured tanks in the stern two-thirds of the tanker.</p>
<p>More than a dozen clean-up ships as well as helicopters are involved in efforts to stop the oil from reaching the coast.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not sure of the volume of the leaked oil. So far we have relied on the accounts of the tanker crew but we really don't know,&quot; the spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Japan's biggest oil spill was in 1971, when 7,200 tonnes (50,400 barrels) of oil spilled from a tanker that ran aground near the port city of Niigata.</p>
<p>&quot;We've tried putting detergent on the slicks and churning them up with the propellers of our boats but as yet we've had no great success,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The Russian-registered Nakhodka was built 26 years ago and authorities said the age of the ship, which was heading to Russia from China, was probably a factor in it breaking apart in the rough seas.</p>
<p>The 31 crew from the tanker were rescued but the captain was still missing. Officials said there was almost no hope that he had survived.</p>
<p>MSA officials have alerted producers of shellfish, seaweed and other sea products along the coast about the possibility of extensive environmental damage if the slicks reach the shore.</p>
<p>The Ama follow centries-old traditions in diving for seafood without the aid of modern breathing equipment.</p>
<p>The agency said the spill had caused no serious disturbance to shipping in the area.</p>
