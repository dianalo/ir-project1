<headline>Dollar well bid but slow in Singapore, mark heavy.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-08-04</dateline>

<p>The dollar remained well bid in Singapore on Monday but dealers said the market was pausing for breath after the U.S. unit surged in New York last week on the back of a bullish U.S. jobs report for July.</p>
<p>Dealers said the mark continued to look heavy against the yen and the European crosses, keeping the dollar well supported against the mark.</p>
<p>They said activity had been very slow during the Asian session with no large flows and a subdued interbank market.</p>
<p>A European bank dealer said the dollar/Swiss franc had risen on early stop-loss buying above the 1.53 level.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think it was just stop-loss triggering rather than any real interest. I think it will range trade in the Far East again, and if there are any moves, it will be in New York,&quot; he said. Dollar/Swiss shot to a four-year high of 1.5295 in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>The dollar hit a high of 1.8665 marks on Friday after the U.S. non-farm payrolls report showed an increase of 316,000 jobs in July, against forecasts of a 193,000 rise.</p>
<p>Dealers said the dollar faced pressure from Japanese exporters above the 119 yen level, while Japanese investors were looking to buy it on dips.  </p>
<p>But fears of verbal intervention by Japanese officials were also likely to limit the dollar's upside against the yen, they said.</p>
