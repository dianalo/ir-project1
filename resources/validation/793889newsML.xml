<p>Singapore fuel oil swaps rose late afternoon on Tuesday due to tight prompt supplies and expectations of fresh buying from China, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuel oil is up almost a dollar from yesterday, I think people have realised that the market is quite tight,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>September fuel oil was last quoted at $103.25/$103.75 per tonne, up from Monday's $102.50/$103.50, brokers said. It traded earlier in the day at $103.00, they said.  </p>
<p>August paper rose sharply with the August/September spread almost flat against an earlier traded value of minus 50 cents, brokers said.</p>
<p>August traded earlier in the day at $103.00 and $103.25, they said.</p>
<p>Traders said the firmer prices was partly due to expectations that a major who was offering cargoes over the past week might cease offering after managing to sell several cargoes.  </p>
<p>Also the upbeat market was attributed to talks that China is gearing up to buy spot cargoes for delivery in late September or October.</p>
<p>Traders said Chinese traders have already began buying September paper over the past few days.</p>
<p>The September gas oil was steady and last quoted unchanged at $23.35/$23.45 per barrel with no deals seen, brokers said.</p>
<p>Chinese gas oil demand is thin as refiners there are operating at higher rates and are processing middle distillate rich crudes.  </p>
<p>As a result, China has cut back its imports considerably leading to a large build up of stocks in Singapore.</p>
<p>Even South Korea, China's natural supplier, has been forced to store gas oil in third party storage facilities such as in Subic Bay, in the Philippines, due to the poor demand from China.</p>
<p>Traders said unless the winter is very cold, demand will be easily met by the region's own capacity and the products that are currently in storage.  </p>
<p>In the spot physical market on Monday, a U.S major sold to a Dutch trader 150,000-barrel for lifting Aug 27-31 at $22.50, up 10 cents from the previous trade on Friday.</p>
