<title>ISRAEL: Israeli unlinked bonds close lower.</title>
<headline>Israeli unlinked bonds close lower.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1996-12-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Israeli unlinked bonds closed lower on Thursday in what traders described as a correction in response to a month of steadily declining yields.</p>
<p>Indices:</p>
<p>* Government bonds general: unchanged at 170.84</p>
<p>* CPI-linked government bonds: +0.02 to 171.56</p>
<p>* Dollar-linked government bonds: -0.16 pct to 169.59</p>
<p>* Unlinked government bonds (Gilon -- issued for four years): -0.15 pct to 171.89</p>
<p>* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: -0.01 pct to 162.11</p>
<p>Volume was moderate at 162 million shekels with traders saying CPI-linked bonds had reached an equilibrium.</p>
<p>&quot;CPI-linked bonds have been stable over the last week and trading has been very quiet,&quot; said Baruch Glicksberg of Clal Insurance.</p>
<p>Traders said CPI-linked short bonds rose slightly while long bonds remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Activity centred on unlinked bonds, which continued to show declines.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlinked bonds rose too fast during the last month and yields became less attractive. What we saw today was a correction,&quot; said Amir Eayal at Epsilon Securities.</p>
<p>Prices for unlinked Makams also continued to fall in response to several weeks of declining yields. &quot;Since the beginning of the week Makam yields have risen from 14.3 percent to 14.73 percent,&quot; Glicksberg said.</p>
<p>Dollar-linked bonds closed lower due to a mild decline in short bonds while long bonds remained almost unchanged.</p>
<p>Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.</p>
