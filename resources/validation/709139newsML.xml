<headline>BASEBALL-WARD PAYS OFF FOR SURGING PIRATES WHO LEAP INTO FIRST.</headline>
<dateline>ST LOUIS, Missouri 1997-07-06</dateline>

<p>Turner Ward got right into the swing of things for the rampaging Pirates by slashing four hits Saturday to help Pittsburgh beat the Cardinals 4-3 and move into sole possession of first place in the NL Central Division.</p>
<p>Ward, who was called up Wednesday from Triple A Calgary of the Pacific Coast League, had three singles and added an RBI double in the three-run seventh inning for the Bucs.</p>
<p>&quot;It's good to be a part of a winning cause,&quot; Ward said. &quot;It was my first four-hit game in the big leagues and it couldn't have come at a better time.&quot;</p>
<p>Jon Lieber (6-8) allowed two runs and six hits over six innings to pick up the win for the surprising Pirates, who won their sixth straight and third in a row over St Louis to move one game ahead of the Cards, last year's division champions.</p>
<p>&quot;Turner Ward was the only guy who could solve Matt Morris to begin with,&quot; said Pirates manager Gene Lamont, referring to the St Louis starter, who struck out nine in 6 2/3 innings.</p>
<p>&quot;I think he's going to be a great addition, he's excellent for our team.&quot;</p>
<p>Pittsburgh's three-run seventh erased a 2-0 deficit.</p>
<p>The loss ended the Cards' streak of winning or tying 11 straight series against NL opponents. The last time they lost a series to an NL opponent had been May 16-19 at Atlanta.</p>
<p>&quot;They beat us in every aspect of the game,&quot; St. Louis manager Tony La Russa said. &quot;They've done that for the past three games. That's all I have to say.&quot;</p>
<p>In Houston, Darryl Kile pitched 7 2/3 no-hit innings and struck out 12 batters in eight-plus innings as the Astros snapped the five-game win streak of the Cincinnati Reds, 2-1.</p>
<p>Kile (10-3) struck out Lenny Harris and Hal Morris in the eighth before Deion Sanders singled cleanly to break up the no-hitter. Willie Greene opened the ninth with his 13th homer, ending the shutout bid and chasing Kile. Billy Wagner came on for his 15th save.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important thing is that we really needed this win tonight and we got it,&quot; Kile said. &quot;The no-hitter really wasn't that important. My job is to hold the lead when we get it.&quot;</p>
<p>James Mouton and Derek Bell drove in runs for the Astros, who moved percentage points ahead of St. Louis into second place in the Central Division, one game behind the Pirates.</p>
<p>Kent Mercker (6-6) was the hard luck loser.</p>
<p>In New York, Edgardo Alfonzo and Carlos Baerga each homered and Cory Lidle bailed starter Mark Clark out of a sixth inning jam to lead the Mets to a 5-3 win over the Florida Marlins.</p>
<p>The victory moved New York to within three games of the second-place Marlins in the National League East. Florida currently leads the wild card race.</p>
<p>Alfonzo, 23, extended his hitting streak to 18 games with a leadoff homer in the third off Alex Fernandez (9-7).</p>
<p>The Mets held a 3-2 lead when Florida loaded the bases with one out in the sixth. Clark struck out Fernandez before manager Bobby Valentine went to the bullpen for Lidle, who retired Kurt Abbott on a popout to first to end the threat.</p>
<p>Baerga then hit his fourth homer of the season in the bottom of the sixth to extend the Mets' lead to 4-2.</p>
<p>John Franco struggled through another ninth inning, but picked up his 20th save. Clark (7-5) got the win.</p>
<p>In Montreal, Tom Glavine allowed six hits over seven innings and Chipper Jones hit his second grand slam of the season as the first-place Atlanta Braves continued their dominance over the Montreal Expos with a 5-3 victory.</p>
<p>Jones belted his 14th homer and second grand slam of the season in the third inning for a 4-0 lead for the Braves, who are 7-0 against Montreal this season.</p>
<p>Glavine (9-4) got the win and Mark Wohlers his 20th save.</p>
<p>Pedro Martinez (10-4) took the loss.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, Jeff Kent delivered a tie-breaking RBI single in the bottom of the eighth inning to lift the San Francisco Giants to a 2-1 victory over the Colorado Rockies.</p>
<p>After being stopped on five hits through seven innings by Darren Holmes, the Giants broke through in the eighth against reliever Mike Munoz (1-3).</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is bailing each other out,&quot; said Kent, who came through for the West leaders after superstar Barry Bonds squandered an RBI chance by grounding out.</p>
<p>Julian Tavarez (2-2), the third Giants pitcher, was the winner, and Rod Beck notched his league-leading 29th save.</p>
<p>The first-place Giants (50-36) won for the 12th time in their final at-bat and dropped the Rockies (43-44) to 1-30 when they score three runs or less.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, the Phillies ended their 11-game losing streak as Scott Rolen doubled home a run and scored on a wild pitch in a five-run seventh inning that vaulted them to an 9-7 victory over the Chicago Cubs.</p>
<p>The victory was Philadelphia's first since June 23 and just their fifth win in the last 34 games.</p>
<p>In San Diego, Ismael Valdes went five scoreless innings before leaving with an injury and combined on an eight-hitter with two relievers as the Los Angeles Dodgers took their fifth straight victory, a 7-3 triumph over the San Diego Padres.</p>
<p>Valdes (5-9) allowed two hits and struck out three before pulling his left hamstring while running out a grounder.</p>
<p>The Dodgers broke open a 2-1 game with three runs in the eighth.</p>
