<title>USA: Rivals test J&amp;J's hold on market for hot heart device.</title>
<headline>Rivals test J&amp;J's hold on market for hot heart device.</headline>

<p>The hottest new medical device for strengthening weak blood vessels in the heart is the stent -- a tiny wire-mesh tube -- and Johnson &amp; Johnson has a lock on the booming U.S. market for it. But not for long.</p>
<p>Rivals are challenging the health care products giant with a host of new stents that J&amp;J concedes will erode its roughly 95 percent share of a market estimated to be worth $720 million this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to defend it, but we are not unrealistic. ... Do we think we're going to remain the stent leader? The answer to that question is yes,&quot; said Robert Croce, company group chairman of J&amp;J's interventional cardiology business.</p>
<p>Stents are helping to solve a problem that for years limited the usefulness of angioplasty, or PTCA -- in which a balloon-tipped catheter is inserted into a clogged cardiac blood vessel, inflated to clear the blockage and removed.</p>
<p>Often following PTCA, the weakened blood vessel that was treated narrows and reclogs, a problem known as restenosis that typically requires another PTCA -- at a cost of about $11,000 each --- or a traumatic coronary artery bypass.</p>
<p>A stent inserted inside the blood vessel at the time of the first PTCA, however, can frequently prevent restenosis by acting as a tubular scaffold to hold the vessel open.</p>
<p>The first stents were implanted in 1986 in Switzerland and France. J&amp;J introduced what would become the industry standard -- the Palmaz-Schatz stent -- a year later.</p>
<p>The hollow stainless steel tube, about the size of a matchstick, has been a blockbuster for J&amp;J, but the bonanza's days are numbered.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like these other companies are going to be in the U.S. market and taking share from J&amp;J,&quot; said Kurt Kruger, a medical device industry analyst at Montgomery Securities, a San Francisco-based brokerage and investment bank.</p>
<p>The earliest challenge to the Palmaz-Schatz came from privately held Cook Group Inc. of Bloomington, Ind., but its Flexstent and GR2 stent have not significantly hurt J&amp;J, based in New Brunswick, N.J.</p>
<p>Another alternative is coming from Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis, which won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in June for its Wiktor stent, seen by analysts as competitive, but not dominant due to low radial strength.</p>
<p>&quot;The Wiktor will fill a breach for Medtronic, but not be a great winner,&quot; Kruger said.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge may come from Indianapolis-based Guidant Corp., which filed for marketing approval from the FDA for its Multi-Link stent on June 12. Analysts expect marketing approval will likely be granted this year, but the company declined to speculate on when the stent may be approved for marketing.</p>
<p>Already on the market in Europe -- where less stringent regulatory activity has allowed more competitors to challenge J&amp;J sooner -- the Multi-Link holds a leading 30 percent European market share.</p>
<p>&quot;Coming into the U.S. market with what we believe is the best stent, and then being the only one to supply it with a rapid-exchange balloon catheter, we think will give us a very nice competitive position,&quot; Guidant Chief Executive Ronald Dollens said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Still more stents are seen coming from Boston Scientific Corp. of Natick, Mass., and Arterial Vascular Engineering Inc. of Santa Rosa, Calif.</p>
<p>For its part, J&amp;J said it was not standing still.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to release quite a few new technologies of our own,&quot; J&amp;J's Croce said.</p>
<p>J&amp;J's high radial-strength Cross-Flex stent was recently released in Europe and it expects to have its new Crown stent on the market by year-end in three lengths and with an innovative delivery system.</p>
<p>Mini-Crown, small-diameter stents, are expected to hit the U.S. market in mid-1998. In 1999, J&amp;J will introduce its Core-Flex and BX stent lines, Croce said.</p>
<p>&quot;The demise is often written very quickly, but there are a lot of advantages that we're going to have,&quot; Croce said.</p>
<p>Any market share loss J&amp;J may feel from the emergence of competition will be further reduced by the growing use of stents, a trend that increases the market for all, Croce said.</p>
<p>J&amp;J data from June and July showed about 45 percent of PTCAs in the United States involved stents. In Europe it was 48 percent and in Japan 33 percent, he said.</p>
<p>For all of 1997, J&amp;J projects &quot;stent penetration&quot; of total PTCA procedures to be about 50 percent in the United States and Europe; about 36 percent to 38 percent in Japan, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is very robust,&quot; Croce said.</p>
