<headline>British media group United News profit up after merger.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>
<text>
<p>British television and national newspaper group United News &amp; Media Plc said Friday its profits rose 12 percent in the first year of a merger which effectively doubled its size.</p>
<p>A media heavyweight was created last year when United News, publisher of national newspapers The Express and Daily Star, joined forces with commercial television and financial services group MAI in a three billion pound ($4.8 billion) deal.</p>
<p>The company said 1996 profits before tax and one-time items rose 12 percent, slightly better than expected, to 290.2 million pounds ($466.0 million). Earnings per share grew 15 percent to 40 pence (64 cents).</p>
<p>&quot;I think we have delivered at the top end of expectations against the agenda we set ourselves at the time of the merger,&quot; Chief Executive Clive Hollick said.</p>
<p>&quot;The review of the businesses following the merger has been completed, with adjustments to the portfolio in some areas and changed operating strategies in others,&quot; said Hollick, who moved across from MAI.</p>
<p>United said savings as a result of the merger and subsequent restructuring were expected to reach 43 million pounds ($69 million) a year by 1998. It took a one-time charge of 56 million pounds ($89.9 million) last year, mainly stemming from the merger.</p>
<p>The company has been active on the disposals and acquisitions front, spending more than 750 million pounds ($1.2 billion) last year as it bought exhibitions group Blenheim and a 29.9 percent stake in regional television broadcaster HTV .</p>
<p>It recouped around 300 million ($481.7 million) by selling a finance company, a legal publisher and local newspaper interests.</p>
<p>United, which operates commercial television (ITV) franchises in southern and eastern England, said operating profit from its broadcasting and entertainment division rose by 36 percent to almost 60 million pounds ($96.3 million).</p>
<p>Profit from the business services unit grew 38 percent to 100.5 million ($161.4 million) but the contribution from financial services edged down to 51.1 million ($82 million).</p>
<p>Earnings from consumer publishing dropped 7.5 percent to 81 million ($130 million) after a 31 million pound ($49.8 million) increase in paper costs.</p>
<p>Hollick said restructuring of the national newspapers should save 15 million pounds ($24.1 million) a year, some of which would be ploughed back into the papers.</p>
<p>The mid-market Daily and Sunday Express newspapers have been relaunched as a combined seven-day operation in a bid to end a long-term sales decline.</p>
