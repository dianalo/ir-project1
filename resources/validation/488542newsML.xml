<p>ABC television has withdrawn from negotions for a new show designed to be a spinoff of the eries &quot;Roseanne&quot;, the New York Times said Friday.</p>
<p>According to executives close to negotiations between the network, owned by Disney, and Carsey-Werner Productions, which produces &quot;Roseanne,&quot; the series would find a new home, the paper said.</p>
<p>One executive familiar with the talks said the show, which would not be called &quot;Roseanne&quot;, could find a different network &quot;within a matter of days,&quot; the Times reported.</p>
<p>For a time, &quot;Roseanne&quot; was the highest-rated show on television but its ratings have declined in recent years.</p>
<p>ABC was unwilling to pay the price asked by the production company and allowed its option on the new series to expire, the Times said.</p>
