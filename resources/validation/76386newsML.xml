<p>High crude oil prices are expected to fuel strong third-quarter earnings in the Canadian oil and gas sector, although oil price hedging will temper the fortunes of several firms, analysts said.</p>
<p>Average results for the sector, which has been a stock market bright light for several months, should exceed those posted in the third quarter of 1995 and the second quarter of this year, said Martin Molyneaux, analyst with FirstEnergy Capital Corp.  </p>
<p>&quot;Third quarter overall should look good operationally and very good financially,&quot; Molyneaux said. &quot;Both commodities are headed in the right direction and volumes are up.&quot;</p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate oil prices, driven by uncertainty surrounding the return of Iraqi oil to world markets amid Iraqi-U.S. conflict, have so far averaged US$22.16 a barrel in the third quarter.</p>
<p>That is up from US$17.77 a barrel in the July-September period of 1995.  </p>
<p>Alberta spot natural gas prices, while showing much smaller gains than those in eastern North America, are also headed for a better quarter. Gas at Empress, Alberta has averaged C$1.27 per gigajoule this quarter, up from C$1.06 in the same period last year.</p>
<p>But many Canadian producers are expected to realize higher gas rices because of longer term supply contracts and an ability to export gas into the more lucrative eastern Canadian and U.S. markets.  </p>
<p>Analysts at several investment houses, including FirstEnergy and CIBC Woody Gundy, said they expected busy drillers Renaissance Energy Ltd and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd to be among the producers showing the strongest results this quarter.</p>
<p>Wood Gundy's Peter Linder said Renaissance, Canadian Natural and Crestar Energy Inc were expected to enjoy the full effects of high crude prices and strong growth in oil output.</p>
<p>Canadian Natural's takeover of Sceptre Resources Ltd was made official during the quarter.  </p>
<p>Molyneaux said he also expected international producer Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd and heavy oil firm Elan Energy Inc to be among the profit leaders in the sector.</p>
<p>Overall, production growth should be much stronger than in the second quarter, when an unusually long winter and spring breakup put a lid on drilling programs in western Canada, analysts said.</p>
<p>Results from several companies, however, were expected to be overshadowed by hedging programs put in place before the crude oil price surge earlier this year.  </p>
<p>Companies that sold forward much of their crude production at prices that looked like premiums at the time of the deals, began to see potential fortunes erode in the second quarter, said ScotiaMcleod analyst Henry Cohen.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be a big problem in the third quarter again,&quot; Cohen said.</p>
<p>Companies projected to suffer from oil price hedging exposure include PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd, Wascana Energy Inc, Petro-Canada and Alberta Energy Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Integrated oil companies, including Petro-Canada, Shell Canada Ltd and Imperial Oil Ltd, were expected to post weaker results in the quarter due to high feedstock costs for their refineries, and gasoline price wars, especially in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, Molyneaux said.</p>
<p>He said the exception would be Suncor Inc, which alone among the four major integrated firms, produces more oil than it processes.</p>
