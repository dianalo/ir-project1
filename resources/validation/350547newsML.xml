<headline>CZECH PM SAYS CROWN DEVALUATION NOT AN OPTION - CNN.</headline>

<p>Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said a devaluation of the Czech crown is not an option to reverse a growing trade deficit, nor were major changes needed in his government's macro-economic policy.</p>
<p>In an interview with Cable News Network (CNN) to be broadcast later on Monday, Klaus said that &quot;devaluation is not the option really... and I don't see drastic dramatic measures in the macro-economic policy are necessary.&quot;  </p>
<p>Klaus said strong Czech economic growth and an &quot;extremely high&quot; investment ratio meant that the situation would not change overnight.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are waiting for is the acceleration of growth in Western Europe,&quot; Klaus said, according to a transcript of the interview taped at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland and provided by CNN.</p>
<p>The Czech trade deficit reached a record 160 billion crowns in 1996, up from a deficit of about 96 billion crowns in 1997, and pushing the current account deficit towards eight percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>Despite the bad trade news, the Czech crown has remained strong. On Monday it was trading a full five percent above parity with the Czech National Bank's mark/dollar basket after being fixed at 4.67 percent above the basket earlier on Monday.  </p>
<p>Klaus said he did not expect a slowing in economic growth, despite a lowering of the official economic outlook earlier in the day by the Czech Statistical Bureau, which forecast four to five percent growth in 1997, down from earlier projections of 5.1 to 5.6 percent growth.</p>
<p>Klaus said a fast slowing of inflation, from its annual rate of 8.8 percent in 1996, would be difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we will be able to go down with inflation more than one (percentage point) a year,&quot; Klaus said.</p>
<p>He said real interest rates, which have been drawing foreign investors into the crown, &quot;are relatively high&quot; partly because of the strong demand for money and investments, and &quot;because of some fragility in the banking system&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is in the change in the macro-economic situation in the whole of Europe, we can, in the short term, change the trade deficit,&quot; Klaus said.  </p>
<p>Klaus said that despite government suggestions to restrain wage growth, real wages growth were &quot;more or less in step with real productivity&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not yet used all our transformation cushion, it will probably take about a year more,&quot; Klaus said.</p>
<p>He also said it was impossible for his Civic Democratic Party (ODS) give up its aim to raise the retirement age for men to 65 in order to avoid a future budget crisis over pensions.</p>
<p>The ODS's junior partner's in the centre-right coalition government, the Christian Democrats, have suggested supporting a lowering, not raising of the planned age to begin pensions.</p>
<p>Klaus's party has threatened to leave the government if the Christian Democrats led a move toward the lower pension age.</p>
<p>&quot;To go back would be something very negative for the whole mental climate in the country,&quot; Klaus said.</p>
