<p>Pope John Paul drew a crowd of more than a million people at a mass on Sunday and his spokesman said the 77-year-old Roman Catholic leader was holding up very well and may visit Poland again.</p>
<p>&quot;I refuse to accept the notion that this is the Pope's last trip to Poland,&quot; chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls told a news conference.</p>
<p>Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek, secretary of the Polish bishops' conference, also said there were &quot;elements&quot; that led him to believe the Pope would visit again, noting that several invitations had been made for him to come next year.</p>
<p>Navarro-Valls said the trip through areas of his youth was an &quot;extraordinary&quot; experience for the Pope.</p>
<p>&quot;He is living through a lot of memories,&quot; he said, adding that the Pope was full of &quot;intellectual curiosity&quot; about where his country was heading.</p>
<p>The Pope, who has had a series of health problems in recent years, appeared in relatively good form as he presided at a three-hour-long mass for a crowd police estimated at more than 1.5 million people.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pope has held up perfectly well,&quot; Navarro-Valls said, adding that he was sleeping well, although rising early as he does normally, and that &quot;there are no signs of any particular problems.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not saying that the Pope in 1997 is the same as he was in 1978 when he was elected, but he shows he has the capacity to do the work,&quot; Navarro-Valls added, suggesting that 11 days on the road home in Poland were perhaps less fatiguing than 16-hour days mostly spent behind a desk at the Vatican.</p>
<p>&quot;I think perhaps here it is less tiring,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Sunday's crowd was the biggest of the trip so far. A sea of people turned out to see the Pope at the Blonia meadows in Krakow, the city where he lived for more than 20 years as priest, bishop and cardinal.</p>
<p>Speaking in a strong voice, the Pontiff told the pilgrims that, now they had regained freedom after nearly half a century of communism, they should use it to spread love and truth.</p>
<p>Thousands of banners went up in the 48-hectare field as the Pope was driven through the crowd in a glass-topped popemobile.</p>
<p>Wearing resplendent gold robes billowing in a soft breeze, he told the crowd that 10 years ago &quot;we had before us the problem of the discovery of freedom&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1987, the country was still run by communists. Two years later in 1989 they gave way to Eastern Europe's first democratically-elected government, headed by the Solidarity trade union, which the Pope unflaggingly backed.</p>
<p>To the Pope's joy after years of praying for a more united Europe, the domino-like fall of the Soviet bloc was under way.</p>
<p>&quot;Now divine providence is putting a new task before us: to love and serve. To love in deed and in truth,&quot; he said speaking from a flower-bedecked altar platform overlooking the expanse.</p>
<p>How Poles should use their freedom in the post-communist era has been the thread running through the Pope's speeches on the trip, his seventh to Poland, which ends on Tuesday when he returns to the Vatican.</p>
<p>Before the mass John Paul had a brief meeting with Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz at the Krakow Archbishop's residence. Asked by Cimoszewicz in front of reporters how his trip was going, the Pope replied &quot;fine&quot;.</p>
<p>The prime minister, a former communist, said later that he had told the Pope &quot;He should be full of optimism, because we will cope with the problems that we have.&quot;</p>
<p>At the mass the Pope canonised Queen Jadwiga, who died in 1399 at the age of 25 after helping to spread Christianity to neighbouring countries, particularly Lithuania.</p>
<p>He prayed that the example of the new saint, whom Poles have venerated for centuries as a holy woman and benefactor of the arts and education, would teach the nation &quot;what it means to love in deed and in truth, what it means to be truly free&quot;.</p>
<p>During the trip he has warned Poles of a moral wilderness and the pitfalls of a get-rich-quick mentality as the once-centralised economy soars to new heights.</p>
<p>He has pulled no punches on some of the most burning issues dividing them, most notably abortion, which he would like to see banned in his homeland.</p>
