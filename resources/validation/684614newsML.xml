<p>Cambodian co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh announced a breakthrough agreement on Tuesday to hold elections in May, declaring this far more important than the capture of infamous leader Pol Pot.</p>
<p>But Ranariddh said he would not allow the matter of Pol Pot's return to Phnom Penh to drag on, and warned a Khmer Rouge splinter group it must hand over the hated strongman soon if it wants an amnesty deal.</p>
<p>World pressure has been building since Pol Pot's capture last Thursday for him to be tried by an international tribunal for his brutal 1975-79 &quot;killing fields&quot; regime, responsible for the deaths of more than one million people.</p>
<p>Ranariddh said he and co-premier Hun Sen had finally agreed on a date for general elections -- May 1998.</p>
<p>Ranariddh, speaking at a pagoda opening on the outskirts of Phnom Penh, said holding the elections was more important for the impoverished country than the hated Pol Pot's capture, which has made headlines around the world.</p>
<p>&quot;Pol Pot is past... for me the elections are much more important,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Diplomats had expressed fears about the timing of the elections amid an upsurge in political violence and increased bickering between the two premiers.</p>
<p>Ranariddh said he and his coalition partner wanted to tell U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, originally scheduled to visit Cambodia later this week, that they had agreed on the date.</p>
<p>However, the U.S. State Department said last week that Albright was reconsidering her trip because of security concerns following a recent gun battle on the streets of Phnom Penh between bodyguards loyal to the two prime ministers.</p>
<p>&quot;Last night Hun Sen called me about the visit of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. We will tell them that... May 1998 will be the general election in this country,&quot; Ranariddh said.</p>
<p>A power struggle between the two prime ministers and a row over how to deal with the remnants of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla force following Pol Pot's capture has crippled the government and led to international concern over escalating political violence.</p>
<p>The Group of Seven industrial nations and Russia at their recent summit in the United States called for an end to the political chaos in Cambodia and urged the country's leaders to &quot;demonstrate their commitment to holding a free and fair election by setting an exact date&quot;.</p>
<p>The current uneasy coalition government emerged from U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993 that followed a peace pact signed two years earlier by rival Cambodian factions.</p>
<p>But Ranariddh has complained that even though he won the largest number of seats in the poll, Hun Sen, leader of the communist government which ruled beforehand, has never shared power equitably.</p>
<p>Now, with the election approaching, the two are in a make-or-break struggle for power.</p>
<p>Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party wants to strike a deal with more moderate elements in the crumbling guerrilla force, a move that Hun Sen sees as a threat to the strength of his Cambodian People's Party (CPP) in the run-up to the polls, political analysts said.</p>
<p>More than one million Cambodians died of starvation, disease and hard labour, or were executed as enemies of the Khmer Rouge during Pol Pot's rule in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Ranariddh on Tuesday dismissed doubts that Pol Pot was being detained by the rebels, but he added that the government wanted a quick return of Pol Pot to Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>He said arrangements would be made for at least one journalist to be taken to see Pol Pot, who is being held in the northwest Khmer Rouge base of Anlong Veng, to put an end to the scepticism.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to talk about days, otherwise I cannot trust them,&quot; the prince said of the breakaway faction which turned against Pol Pot earlier this month.</p>
<p>&quot;If they are asking for an amnesty they have to be logical... and hand over Pol Pot to us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pol Pot fled Anlong Veng earlier this month after ordering the execution of his defence chief and almost a dozen of his family members.</p>
<p>The renegade Khmer Rouge faction captured Pol Pot last Thursday.</p>
<p>Speaking about the elections, Ranariddh said he wanted international monitoring of the poll.</p>
<p>Legislation needed to hold the elections is currently being drafted. It has yet to be submitted to the National Assembly, which has rarely met this year due to the political infighting.</p>
<p>Hun Sen had previously branded all contact with the Khmer Rouge illegal and told Ranariddh last week to choose between working with him in their coalition or joining the rebels.</p>
