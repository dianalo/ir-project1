<p>Spot U.S. Mid-Atlantic bulk electricity prices remained firm Thursday amid the startup of the 1,100 megawatt (MW) Peach Bottom 2 nuclear power plant in Delta, Pa., market sources said.</p>
<p>The unit, operated by PECO Energy Co, tripped off line Tuesday due to an electrical problem with the turbine generator.</p>
<p>Warmer-than-normal autumn weather in the southern portion of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnect district triggered some cooling demand, traders and brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We actually have a little air-conditioning load,&quot; said a PJM trader.  </p>
<p>However, the latest forecasts showed temperatures in the upper portion of the eastern seaboard would decline sharply Friday if a cold front were to arrive as expected.</p>
<p>Several large PJM generating stations were planned to resume operation from scheduled refueling and maintenance in the next several days.</p>
<p>GPU Generation Inc today said a 850 MW unit at the Conemaugh coal-fired facility in western Pennsylvania would return on line today after being shut Sept 22 for maintenance.</p>
<p>Firm, peak electricity for Friday delivery was quoted at $23.00-$24.50 a megawatt hour (MWh), compared with Wednesday's $23.75-$24.75.</p>
<p>Friday PJM power during off-peak hours was notationally pegged in the $13.00-$16.00 range.</p>
<p>PJM electricity for Saturday was assessed near $18.25 and Sunday $17.00.</p>
<p>Firm, peak PJM deliveries for the rest of October were quoted again at $22.50-$23.50.</p>
<p>November PJM electricity was assessed at $23.00-$23.50, a wider range than $23.00-$23.25 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>December PJM power was pegged at $27.00-$27.45, compared with Wednesday's $27.00-$27.25.</p>
<p>January/February 1997 PJM was discussed at $31.00-$31.60, versus a quote of $31.00-$31.50 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>First quarter 1997 PJM was quoted at $28.90-$29.10, against $29.00-$29.10 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Second quarter 1997 PJM electricity was valued at $21.75-$22.25, flat from Wednesday.</p>
<p>July/August 1997 deliveries was pegged at $31.00-$31.35, compared with a quote near $31.35 on Wednesday.</p>
