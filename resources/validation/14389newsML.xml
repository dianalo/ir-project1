<p>The executive chairman of Australia's Ansett Airlines Ltd, Ken Cowley, has told his managers to cut A$150 million from Ansett's annual cost base of A$3 billion over the next two years, a spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;What Ken said was that the airline was targetting A$150 million in annual operating costs and that it wanted to reduce the annual operating cost base by that amount progressively over the next two years,&quot; an Ansett spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Cowley also said Ansett wanted to raise revenues by about the same amount over that time, the spokesman said.  </p>
<p>&quot;He said there were about A$80 million (in costs) that could be cut out over the next eight to nine months,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Cowley's comments made to a meeting of about 200 executives last Friday were also detailed in reports in The Australian and The Australian Financial Review newspapers today</p>
<p>Cowley told the meeting that he believed that the planned purchase by Air New Zealand Ltd of TNT Ltd's 50 percent stake in Ansett would help cut costs.  </p>
<p>&quot;He said (the linkup) would offer opportunities for about A$50 million in those costs to be taken out through issues such as joint cooperation, economies of scale and synergies that come together with the two airlines working together,&quot; the spokesman quoted Cowley as saying.</p>
<p>The balance of the cost cuts would take longer to emerge, but few areas would be spared, Cowley said.</p>
<p>&quot;He said the review of the airline's operating efficiencies would have no sacred cows except for safety and service standards,&quot; the spokesman said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The cost cuts represent about five percent of the total cost base and the revenue enhancements represent about five percent also,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Last week, News Corp Ltd, which owns 50 percent of Ansett, said the airline made a loss in the year to June 30, 1996, due to increased competition and extra market capacity on key domestic routes, along with additional costs with the start of new services to Jakarta and Taiwan.</p>
