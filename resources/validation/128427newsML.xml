<p>Pakistan captain Wasim Akram scored an unbeaten half-century to lead his side's revival on the third day of the first cricket test against Zimbabwe on Saturday.</p>
<p>Left-handed Akram had made a polished 75 not out, his fifth half-century in 71 tests, as Pakistan went into lunch at 293 for seven in response to Zimbabwe's first innings total of 375.</p>
<p>Pakistan, 189 for six overnight, lost only Moin Khan in a productive morning session during which 104 runs were added.</p>
<p>Moin had taken his score from three to 18 before becoming leg-spinner Paul Strang's fifth victim.</p>
<p>He failed to get over an attempted square-cut and was taken by Andrew Whittal at point after adding 54 runs for the seventh wicket with Akram.</p>
<p>Akram drove crisply and brought up his half-century from 70 balls with his seventh four, a sweetly timed drive off Whittal.</p>
<p>His innings also included three sixes, all struck cleanly off Strang who has taken five for 110.</p>
<p>At lunch, Saqlain Mushtaq was on seven in an unbroken eighth-wicket stand of 56, Pakistan's best against the visitors.</p>
