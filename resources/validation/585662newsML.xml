<p>This is how major world bond markets were trading in late European business on Thursday.</p>
<p>GERMANY - German Bunds remained mired at low levels in late trade on Thursday, dragged down by weaker U.S. Treasuries and watching uncomfortably as domestic tax, central bank and budget news spilled out. The June Bund future on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) was trading at 102.32, down 0.18 from Wednesday's settlement price.</p>
<p>BRITAIN - UK gilts ended Thursday 3/32 lower but partly recovered earlier losses. The June long gilt future on LIFFE was trading at 114-12/32, down 05/32 from Wednesday's settlement price.</p>
<p>FRANCE - French bond and PIBOR futures closed lower after a moderate day of trading that saw French markets unable to capitalise on friendly U.S. data. The June notional bond future on the MATIF in Paris settled at 130.26 down 0.38 from Wednesday's settlement price.</p>
<p>ITALY - Italian bonds and futures had a droopy day after recent gains and dealers said they were taking the opportunity for a pause. The June bond future on LIFFE was trading at 130.21 down 0.18 from Wednesday's settlement price.</p>
<p>UNITED STATES - Treasuries struggled back. Philly Fed business activity index dropped to 1.6 in May from Apr 5.7, seen friendly along with mild 0.1 Apr CPI rise, and unchanged Apr ind production. The June Treasury bond future on the Chicago Board of Trade was trading at 110-06/32, up 01/32 from Wednesday's settlement price. The long bond was quoted to yield 6.89 percent.</p>
<p>JAPAN - Key June Japanese government bond (JGB) futures gave up most of their earlier gains by late afternoon and ended Thursday's Tokyo session just slightly higher. In after hours trading the June future on LIFFE was trading at 123.82, up 0.04 from Wednesday's settlement price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>EUROBONDS - A chunky sovereign transaction dominated primary market business during a brisk session on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Italy set a 1.25 billion guilder 15-year bond which will be redenominated into euros if and when the Netherlands switches from guilders to the European Union's planned single currency.</p>
<p>Italy already has a seven-year euro Eurobond it launched in March when it became the first sovereign borrower to raise funds in the euro itself. Italy is keen to be among the first nations adopting the euro. But financial markets have doubts about its chances of meeting the qualifying criteria.</p>
