<title>JAPAN: Japan machinery orders on rising trend - EPA.</title>
<headline>Japan machinery orders on rising trend - EPA.</headline>

<p>Japan's machinery orders are on a rising trend, an Economic Planning Agency official told reporters on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>However, he added that a 7.2 percent month-on-month rise in April for core private machinery orders, excluding those for machinery at electric power firms and for ships, was slightly smaller than the EPA had expected.</p>
<p>&quot;March recorded a double-digit drop and thus we thought April's rise could have been a little bit bigger,&quot; he said, adding that it was necessary to watch movements in May and June.</p>
<p>The EPA has forecast a 4.5 percent quarter-on-quarter rise for the April-to-June quarter, and the official said that in order to achieve this, a 7.2 percent month-on-month rise was needed in each of the three months.</p>
<p>He said some of the orders which were expected in April were likely to appear in May and June, but added that if orders were weaker than expected in May and June, it could cause the EPA to slightly downgrade its assessment of the trend in machinery orders.</p>
<p>He said that even though private machinery orders fell 6.1 percent in year-on-year terms in April, this was due to one very large order in April last year.</p>
<p>He said that excluding the one large order, the year-on-year figure would have shown a rise of slightly more then three percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Even in year-on-year terms, the trend has not changed,&quot; he said.</p>
