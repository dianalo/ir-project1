<headline>CompUSA stock falls on sluggish retail sales.</headline>

<p>CompUSA Inc. said Wednesday its profits more than doubled in the latest quarter but the computer retailer's stock plunged on evidence store sales will slow ahead of the crucial Christmas season.</p>
<p>CompUSA said its net income for the 13 weeks ended Sept. 28 climbed to $14.5 million, or 31 cents a share, from $6.2 million, or 15 cents a share, as its sales soared by 27 percent to $991 million from $782 million.</p>
<p>However, the Dallas-based chain's stock fell $5.75 to $45.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most active issues with almost 3.5 million shares traded.</p>
<p>The stock has now slumped almost 20 percent in the last two days, even though earnings exceeded expectations. The share price fell $5.50 on Tuesday after Salomon Brothers warned of a softening of retail computer sales.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Jim Halpin Wednesday acknowledged a slowdown in the growth of retail sales, which account for 60 percent of its business, and expressed caution about the critical Christmas season.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, retail sales have been somewhat sluggish,&quot; he said on a conference call. &quot;Like all retailers, we are approaching the holiday season with cautious optimism.&quot;</p>
<p>Halpin told Reuters he expected same-store sales for the second quarter, which covers the Christmas holiday season and ends Dec. 28, to grow between 5 percent and 6 percent.</p>
<p>That compares with same-store sales growth of 10.5 percent in the same quarter last year. Same-store sales during the full fiscal year 1996 were up 12.6 percent.</p>
<p>CompUSA has impressed Wall Street with its performance in recent years, and analysts said the sudden drop in the share price reflected concerns of slower industry growth rather than business problems specific to CompUSA.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a lot of profits in this stock and so it got hit hard,&quot; said Dennis Telzrow of Principal Financial Securities. He said some of the chain's competitors &quot;would kill&quot; to have the numbers that CompUSA is posting.</p>
<p>The consumer electronics industry has slowed in 1996 and retailers say they have been hurt by a scarcity of major new products like Microsoft's Windows 95 or multimedia products that captivated consumers last year.</p>
<p>Halpin said sales of laptop computers &quot;are on fire&quot; but acknowledged that sales of desktop models &quot;are a litle slow.&quot;</p>
<p>He refused to comment on a Salomon Brothers research report that said the growth of CompUSA's retail computer sales has in recent weeks slowed to zero from 3-to-4 percent in the last quarter.</p>
<p>Halpin stressed CompUSA had an &quot;excellent&quot; fiscal first quarter and that its direct sales to corporations and its services business were growing strongly and helped offset slower retail sales.</p>
<p>He said CompUSA has opened five new computer superstores since the end of September and would open nine more by the end of December, rising the total to 120.</p>
