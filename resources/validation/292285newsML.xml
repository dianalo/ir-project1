<title>SINGAPORE: Singapore oil products mixed in lacklustre trade.</title>
<headline>Singapore oil products mixed in lacklustre trade.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-01-07</dateline>

<p>The Singapore oil products closed mixed on Tuesday on conflicting market news where firmer crude prices in the West were offset by weaker Asian demand, traders said.</p>
<p>High sulphur fuel oil was offered down to $123.75 per tonne, about $3 lower than Monday, with some traders saying that fundamentals are under pressure as demand from China has eased.</p>
<p>&quot;Activities in the Chinese market would come to a halt with the Chinese New Year lasting more than half a month (from early February) as power companies and industries would be closed,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Gas oil was steady on prompt buying interest from the same Singapore trader who bought one cargo on Monday.</p>
<p>The trader bought 185,000-barrels of gas oil for loading in end January at $32.15 per barrel free-on-board Singapore from a European major, 5 cents higher than Monday's traded level.</p>
<p>Traders said the gas oil market is under some downward pressure due to reduced Chinese demand for February, large South Korea export availabilites and a fresh Taiwanese export tender.</p>
<p>The decision by the workers at South Korea's Hyundai Petrochemical to go on partial strike could add a bearish note to the naphtha market.  </p>
<p>But so far naphtha in Singapore was not affected and rose with crude. Swaps were quoted sharply higher with January bid at $25.20 a barrel, up 40 cents from Monday's prices.</p>
<p>Singapore refiners indicated a healthy selling premium of around $1.00 per barrel over spot quotes but no physical trade was reported.</p>
<p>Gasoline firmed on the back of higher crude and naphtha in a well-supplied market. Traders assessed the gasoline/naphtha spread at $1.50 a barrel. Only a 92-octane cargo lifting Jan 22-26 was sought at $26.20 a barrel, up 20 cents from Monday's bid. --Singapore Newsroom (+65-870-3093)</p>
