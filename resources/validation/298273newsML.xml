<title>NETHERLANDS: HEINEKEN STEPS UP BURUNDI BEER PRODUCTION.</title>

<p>Dutch brewer Heineken NV said on Thursday it had stepped up beer production in Burundi, after being urged to do so by the Burundi authorities.</p>
<p>Burundi's central African neighbours closed their borders against it following a Tutsi-led military coup in July.</p>
<p>&quot;The Burundi authorities told us in veiled terms we should step up activity. As the security of our people is essential to us, we have increased our production and as such we may inadvertently be breaking the embargo,&quot; Heineken spokeswoman Margritha Meijer told Reuters.</p>
<p>She stressed the breweries were using malt which had been ordered in Rwanda before the Burundi boycott. &quot;This malt has been laying in customs sheds since and has now been put at our disposal,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Heineken has a 60 percent stake in local brewery Brarudi, which has two plants and a total production capacity of 1.2 million hectolitres. The Burundi state owns 40 percent of Barudi, which employs over 1,300 people.</p>
<p>&quot;Some 90 percent of the people have returned to work. The main brewery in the capital of Bujumbura, is operational, but the one in Gitaga is still closed,&quot; Meijer said.</p>
<p>She could not give an indication of the production level.</p>
<p>&quot;These (malt) stocks are sufficient to keep us going for a while. We are not producing at full capacity, its a matter of supply and demand,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Bujumbura plant had been operating at some 25 percent of capacity before owing to the boycott, Meijer added.</p>
<p>She declined to comment on the likely reasons why Burundi authorities were pressuring Heineken to step up production.</p>
<p>The country's economy is said to be heavily dependent on taxes paid by the brewer.</p>
<p>Heineken has been active in the country for 45 years and said before it would not consider pulling out in times of trouble.</p>
