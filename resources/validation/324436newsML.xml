<title>BRAZIL: Brazil soap opera murder trial starts.</title>
<headline>Brazil soap opera murder trial starts.</headline>
<dateline>RIO DE JANEIRO 1997-01-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>The high-profile trial of an actor and his former wife accused of murdering his screen lover began on Wednesday in a Brazilian court after frequent delays, officials said.</p>
<p>Guilherme de Padua and Paula Thomaz are accused of stabbing to death 22-year-old actress Daniela Perez four years ago in a case that has gripped millions of Brazilian soap opera fans.</p>
<p>A judge at the Rio de Janeiro court earlier suspended the proceedings as soon as they began after de Padua's defence lawyer demanded the presence of a former Rio coroner, who had been giving media interviews.</p>
<p>The court later accepted as evidence one of the coroner's taped television interviews.</p>
<p>Prosecutors and defence lawyers agreed to separate the trials of the two defendants and the proceedings, expected to continue for several days, opened with de Padua taking the witness stand.</p>
<p>In the soap opera &quot;De Corpo e Alma&quot; (of Body and Soul), de Padua, now 27, played the brooding boyfriend of sexy teenager Yasmin, interpreted by Perez.</p>
<p>He originally confessed to murdering Perez, but later accused Thomaz, now 23, of carrying out the stabbing in a fit of jealousy. The two were married at the time but divorced after he was arrested.</p>
<p>The 1992 killing even eclipsed news of the ongoing impeachment of former President Fernando Collor and spawned calls for a crackdown in Brazil's justice system, where well-connected defendants often go unpunished.</p>
<p>If convicted, De Padua and Thomaz face a maximum sentence of 30 years in jail. But under Brazilian law, first-time offenders can be released after serving a sixth of their term. Both defendants have already spent the past four years behind bars.</p>
