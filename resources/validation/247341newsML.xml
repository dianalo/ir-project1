<title>ITALY: Italian president opposes graft amnesty.</title>

<p>President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro expressed opposition on Tuesday to an amnesty for defendants in Italy's multitude of corruption scandals.</p>
<p>The head of state made his position clear in a statement published after he met the speakers of the two houses of parliament for talks on a crisis in the Italian justice system.</p>
<p>The statement, issued by Scalfaro's office, said judicial reform should be undertaken in a way that avoided &quot;solutions which wipe the slate clean and do not correspond to the canons of justice&quot;.</p>
<p>The phrase was a clear reference to renewed debate on how to move on from the corruption scandals that have shaken Italy since 1992 and brought down its old governing class.</p>
<p>Several politicians have argued that some form of amnesty should be proclaimed to close the matter.</p>
<p>Investigations by magistrates into alleged corruption in public life have dominated Italian affairs for four years.</p>
<p>Their conduct has blurred the separation of powers between parliament and the judiciary and heightened a sense among many Italians that the courts have become a battleground for settling political scores and for rivalry among magistrates.</p>
<p>The confusion was highlighted last week when prosecutors sent police to raid homes and offices of Antonio Di Pietro, a former star anti-graft magistrate who quit as a cabinet minister last month to fight allegations that he too was corrupt.</p>
<p>Di Pietro has called the inquiry a &quot;squalid vendetta&quot;.</p>
<p>Many of Italy's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Romano Prodi and opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi, have been caught up in the judicial assault.</p>
<p>The sheer number of cases, running to more than 1,000, has also overwhelmed a trial system notorious for its slowness.</p>
<p>Scalfaro's statement indicated that parliament's speakers would take steps to ensure swift discussion of draft legislation on judicial reform and on the prevention and repression of corruption.</p>
<p>It was welcomed by the governing centre-left alliance as pointing the way to a more efficient justice system and criticised by Berlusconi's centre-right opposition as undue interference in the work of parliament.</p>
