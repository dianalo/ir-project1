<p>As darkness eats away at Sweden's winter, leaving just a few hours of light a day, the blues often start to set in.</p>
<p>Up to four percent of Swedes are estimated at some point during their lives to slip into a winter depression that is characterised by lethargy, disturbed sleep patterns, a change in appetite and a reduced sex drive.</p>
<p>The winter blues, once dismissed as merely an over-reaction to freezing temperatures and long, dark days, have become recognised over the past 10 years as a real, but treatable, threat to a significant number of people worldwide.</p>
<p>Called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), this specific form of depression is believed to be caused by a lack of daylight and can be treated by light therapy.</p>
<p>&quot;No one knows what the cause is and there are no absolutely typical symptoms. The only real constant is the seasonality,&quot; Professor Lennart Wetterberg of Sweden's top medical research organisation, the Karolinska Institute, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Some northern areas of Sweden have no daylight at all at the depth of the long, Nordic winter and the capital, Stockholm, has only six hours, so Swedes and the neighbouring Finns and Norwegians are susceptible to SAD.</p>
<p>&quot;It is obvious that Swedish people behave differently in summer than winter and it is considered normal to be a bit low in mood in winter,&quot; said Wetterberg, who has been working with SAD in Sweden for the past 10 years.</p>
<p>&quot;Some immigrants who move here leave because they can't stand it and a lot of Swedes will move to Australia or other sunny countries during the winter or take a sunny holiday.&quot;</p>
<p>TYPICAL SUFFERER</p>
<p>He said the typical SAD sufferer is female, aged between 20 and 50, and can either sleep up to double her usual amount in winter and crave carbohydrates, causing weight gain, or find sleeping difficult and lose her appetite.</p>
<p>Ann Zetterlund of Stockholm has suffered SAD all her life, with the depression starting every October and causing her sleepless winter nights and severe mood swings.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was a child no-one knew anything about this and I just had to plough through the days,&quot; said 56-year-old Zetterlund, a school study counsellor, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I got so angry and tense. I had to learn to control my temper.&quot;</p>
<p>Zetterlund said she became aware of SAD about two years ago through newspaper reports and instantly recognised her problem.</p>
<p>She was referred to the Karolinska Institute and underwent light therapy treatment, subjected to high doses of light about 10 times more powerful than a normal light bulb in a white-clad room for several hours a day for 10 days.</p>
<p>&quot;I had just been in that room for 30 seconds and it was like light was suddenly entering my body,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;I had never related my problems before to the light. You don't think about the cause and of course it is so simple when you realise what it is.&quot;</p>
<p>Zetterlund said that this year she started light treatment before the onset of winter with regular therapy each week to keep SAD at bay and for the first winter ever she had not felt the ill effects of the season.</p>
<p>STUDIES CONTINUING</p>
<p>Wetterberg said it had taken years to link a lack of light to seasonal depression and studies still often clashed.</p>
<p>A study carried out on the eastern seaboard of the United States found there was a four-fold increase in SAD among people living in New Hampshire in the chill of the northeast, compared to residents in the warmth of Florida.</p>
<p>But a postal survey in Britain involving 1,500 people found no clear proof that SAD was more related to daylight than to miserable weather.</p>
<p>Wetterberg said Sweden and other countries with dark, cold winters were not the only places where people suffer SAD.</p>
<p>A study is currently underway in San Diego in sunny, warm California in the United States where a large number of people have been found to suffer from SAD -- due to office designs.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though there is bright sunshine outside, some office workers do not get enough daylight as they're cooped up in buildings with no windows, so they get SAD,&quot; Wetterberg said.</p>
<p>&quot;In modern living it really can depend on how much you are outside. Everyone knows you need clean water and fresh air but there needs to be more awareness of the importance of light.&quot;</p>
<p>Wetterberg said more research was needed on SAD.</p>
<p>Only 50 to 60 percent of sufferers responded well to intensive light therapy and quicker than to medicines.</p>
<p>Scientists needed to find out who responded to light treatment, why and when it was best given, he added.</p>
<p>This was done by monitoring sufferers' melatonin levels. Melatonin, produced by the pineal gland, is known as the sleep hormone and can be used to supplement people's internal body clocks, with light treatment given to help the body's timing and ensure a regular sleep pattern.</p>
<p>Wetterberg said melatonin is a marker on genes which could go some of the way to explain why women are more prone to SAD than men and why it can be hereditary.</p>
<p>Research was also continuining into the sensitivity of the retina in the eye, as it had been found that this was the important entry point for light for SAD victims, not the skin.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important not just to put people in bright light but to find the difference between responses,&quot; Wetterberg said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a rapidly moving field but more resources are needed if we are to get to the bottom of it in the next 10 years.&quot;</p>
