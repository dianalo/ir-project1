<p>At least 10 people including five Indian paramilitary troops were injured on Saturday in two grenade attacks in busy market places in the heart of troubled Kashmir's summer capital, police said.</p>
<p>They said suspected separatist guerrillas lobbed a hand grenade at an army patrol in the crowded Regal chowk in the heart of Srinagar, seriously injuring three soldiers and hurting four female students.</p>
<p>The soldiers opened fire in panic, but no one was hurt in the firing, police said.</p>
<p>Two paramilitary soldiers were wounded when suspected separatist guerrillas hurled another grenade at a patrol at Maulana Azad Road, only 100 metres (yards) from Regal, police said.</p>
<p>Over a dozen militant groups are fighting New Delhi's rule in Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Moslem majority state, where police and hospitals say more than 20,000 people have been killed in a seven-year-old rebellion.</p>
