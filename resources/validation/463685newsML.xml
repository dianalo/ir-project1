<p>A two-and-a-half year battle over the future of Germany's Philipp Holzmann AG looked close to a finish on Monday, as the builder called a surprise joint news conference with rival Hochtief AG.</p>
<p>Hochtief and Holzmann AG, summoning the media for 1100 GMT on Tuesday, were expected to announce a deal giving Hochtief increased indirect control over its industry rival, while neatly dodging cartel office objections to a broader tie-up.</p>
<p>The two firms said they would inform the media about plans to pool stakes totalling almost 50 percent held in Holzmann by Deutsche Bank AG and Hochtief. Deutsche will be a co-host at the news conference, the two building groups said.</p>
<p>The arrangement involves a 25.8 percent stake held by Deutsche Bank AG and a 20 percent interest held by construction group Hochtief AG .</p>
<p>Hochtief set out in September 1994 to force a reluctant Holzmann into mutual cooperation abroad by raising its stake in the group by 10 percent to around 30 percent.</p>
<p>In October of that year, Hochtief chairman Hans-Peter Keitel threatened to continue to raise its stake to give the rival group voting control of Holzmann's shareholder meetings, arguing a 40 percent stake would probably be enough to do this.</p>
<p>But the bid to increase the stake ran into cartel office problems due to the dominance of the two groups within the domestic German market.</p>
<p>Pleas from Hochtief that the position was very different abroad failed to convince the cartel authorities to withdraw their objections.</p>
<p>No details of the plan to pool the two stakes were released in the brief announcement that a news conference was planned.</p>
<p>&quot;The subject of the news conference will be the companies' planned pooling of the stakes of just under 50 percent held by Deutsche Bank AG and Hochtief AG in Philipp Holzmann AG,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, a spokesman for Deutsche confirmed on Monday that it was in talks over such a plan but said no deal had been reached. A spokeswoman for Hochtief, the country's second largest builder, also confirmed talks were taking place.</p>
<p>Shares in Holzmann surged 29 marks, more than five percent, to 549 marks on speculation that a deal was imminent, although construction analysts noted that trading volumes were low.</p>
<p>Hochtief ended trade 1.20 marks higher at 71.40.</p>
<p>A German court of appeals had been due next month to start hearings as to whether Hochtief should be allowed to extend its 20 percent stake by approving the purchase of one block of 4.9 percent and letting it take options on a further 10 percent.</p>
<p>But Hochtief said in a separate statement that it had closed the door on that possibility, by striking a deal with Commerzbank AG annulling an agreement giving Hochtief the right to buy a further 10 percent stake held by the bank.</p>
<p>Construction analysts said they saw the share pooling plan as a &quot;safety net&quot; arrangement but were sceptical as to whether the deal would silence the cartel office's worries.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't immediately see what purpose this could serve for Hochtief,&quot; Karin Brinkmann, analyst at Munich-based Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel-Bank said.</p>
<p>Analysts said that because of the size of the two firms the cartel authorities would be likely to look critically at any collaboration achieved through any pooling deal.</p>
<p>European Commission competition authorities might also need to approve the deal, they added.</p>
<p>Holzmann, which shocked the market with 1995 losses that included a write-down of 458 million marks on property losses, has seen its stock rise sharply in recent months on speculation of increased control by Hochtief management.</p>
<p>It has said in the past that it welcomes cooperation possibilities with Hochtief but would oppose any move signalling a desire for Hochtief to exert greater management influence.</p>
