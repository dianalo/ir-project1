<p>It was a tough week for Wall Street dealmakers.</p>
<p>A handful of corporate transactions -- including one of the year's biggest deals -- ran into trouble as the stock market slid on worries about rising interest rates and concerns that first-quarter earnings may disappoint investors.</p>
<p>Merger experts said the problems this week did not appear to be linked to the market's decline, but warned that continued stock market losses could hurt the booming business of mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>&quot;The worst thing for the M &amp; A (merger and acquisition) business is volatility in the market. When you have volatility, it makes it difficult to price deals involving stock. Even on deals that aren't announced, but are in the process of being negotiated, price expectations change because the (stock) goes down,&quot; said Joel Cohen, director of mergers and acquisitions at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.</p>
<p>One of the week's biggest blows came from Washington on Friday when the Federal Trade Commission rejected a proposed $4 billion merger between Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc.. The move marked the second time that antitrust authorities rejected the proposed union of the two office supply companies.</p>
<p>Another big development was the collapse of a proposed $1 billion merger agreement between ShopKo Stores Inc. and Phar-Mor Inc.. Sources close to the transaction said a drop in Phar-Mor's stock price was one of the key issues that led to the death of the deal after months of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Problems also arose for security firms Checkpoint Systems Inc. and Ultrak Inc. , which late Thursday called off their proposed merger, originally valued at about $400 million. The companies said they canceled the deal because of perceived differences in sales methods.</p>
<p>Kmart Corp. and Waban Inc. also called off talks aimed at combining their home improvement businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the things that fell apart (did so) for unique reasons. The market is going to have to be down and down for a prolonged period before it affects people's appetites to do a transaction,&quot; said David Spalding, vice chairman at The Cypress Group, a New York buy-out firm.</p>
<p>Yet merger experts acknowledged that the market slump likely made some bankers and executives edgy.</p>
<p>&quot;You've got a down market, so clearly that's going to upset some deals and some negotiations that are in progress. There is probably going to be some fall-out, but I don't think you can get too nervous&quot;, said Steven Wolitzer, managing director at Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>However, he added: &quot;If you had trouble with a deal to begin with, this might be the icing on the cake.&quot;</p>
<p>The pace of mergers and acquisitions has been robust so far this year. U.S. companies racked up a record $183 billion worth of transactions in the first quarter, eclipsing the previous first-quarter record of $120.6 billion set in 1995, according to Newark, N.J.-based Securities Data Co., which tracks merger activity.</p>
