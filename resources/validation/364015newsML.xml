<headline>AOL to spend $10-$15 mln to lease modems.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-06</dateline>

<p>America Online Inc said it will spend about $10-$15 million to lease 50,000 additional modems to expand its capacity, a move a top executive said is the &quot;smartest money it could spend at this time.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier, when America Online reported second quarter earnings, it said it will lease an additional 50,000 modems from outside suppliers, which will enable it to accelerate its network upgrade a full two months ahead of its previous plan.</p>
<p>&quot;This way we are not stuck with it, if we end up building out AOL faster or if we find that demand is not going up as fast,&quot; said Bob Pittman, president and CEO of AOL Networks.  </p>
<p>Pittman, in a brief interview, declined to say who AOL was leasing the modem capacity from, except that it was not leasing the modems from Internet service providers.</p>
<p>&quot;We are renting from other networks in the business of providing network capacity,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it's an excellent solution.&quot;</p>
<p>Some analysts had indeed been worried that AOL would build out its network to have too much capacity, that would become under-used if the current upsurge in demand diminishes.</p>
<p>The $10-$15 million is in addition to its current $350 million program to expand the AOL network, the company said.  </p>
<p>Pittman said that AOL is continuing its focus on its current members. AOL plans to hold its current membership at eight million until the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is we are turning off the marketing machine and we are expecting to stay at eight million until the end of the third quarter,&quot; Pittman said. &quot;I've come out of the theme park business where some days you have to make that tough decision, you have to close the doors of the park. We serve the members we have.&quot;</p>
<p>He declined to estimate how many members AOL may have lost due to its network problems, which resurfaced again Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Late Wednesday, AOL members trying to log onto the system could not sign on for about two to three hours, from 1700 EST/2200 GMT until about 2000 EST, because of an upgrade in AOL's login software. The network was up and running, but new users could not sign on during the period.</p>
<p>Pittman said that AOL will &quot;turn the marketing machine back on again&quot; once it is sure that it has normal and acceptable levels of connectivity, but he declined to make any further predictions.</p>
<p>He said that any members who have left AOL because of the network problems would be the easiest to gain back.  </p>
<p>&quot;We think that some members are going to leave over the demand issue, but we think the steps we are taking will solve that,&quot; Pittman said.</p>
<p>AOL's chief financial officer, Len Leader, said he did not expect AOL to incur any more charges stemming from its settlement regarding member credits and refunds beyond the $24 million charge. AOL set aside $24 million as reserves.</p>
<p>AOL reported a second quarter operating loss of $0.60 a share, before charges. The First Call consensus was for a loss of $0.55 a share, before any restructuring charges.  </p>
<p>Brian Oakes, a Lehman Brothers analyst, said that the second quarter at AOL was a &quot;transitional quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's pretty much a moot point,&quot; Oakes said. &quot;There wasn't anything bad in the numbers. We have to see how (the) March (quarter) works out.&quot; He pointed out that AOL's cash improved to $130 million due to the larger upfront payments by subscribers, who paid for one- or two-year memberships in advance, as part of AOL's new pricing plan in December.</p>
