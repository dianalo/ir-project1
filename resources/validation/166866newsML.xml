<p>Europe's largest glacier, sitting atop an active volcano, buckled on Tuesday, sending a torrent of water and ice onto an uninhabited plain in southeast Iceland.</p>
<p>Scientists had predicted the vast outpouring from a sub-glacial lake swollen by last month's eruption below the Vatnajokul ice cap. But they said it was faster and more violent than expected.</p>
<p>Hydrologist Arni Snorrason was measuring river levels at the foot of the glacier when the floods began around 0800 GMT on Tuesday. Black water and ice swept across the remote and treeless plain.</p>
<p>&quot;We had to run for our lives when it broke through. It's picking up speed much faster than we expected,&quot; Snorrason told National Icelandic Radio.</p>
<p>&quot;We are facing the worst of the possibilities we imagined beforehand.&quot;</p>
<p>Pressure under the Vatnajokul Glacier had been building since the volcano erupted in early October, bursting through the glacier and pouring out a column of ash and steam up to 10 kms (six miles) high.</p>
<p>The eruption melted part of the ice cap, filling the sub-glacial Grimsvotn Lake to bursting point.</p>
<p>Most recent estimates put the volume of melt water collected in Grimsvotn at over 3,000 billion cubic litres.</p>
<p>The volcano went quiet in mid-October but the North Atlantic island has remained on alert for massive flooding, which could cut the country's only coastal ring road and bridges and power and telecommunication lines passing through the area.</p>
<p>Authorities have been reinforcing dykes and building channels through the road to direct the flood.</p>
<p>Stefan Benediktsson, warden at the Skaftafell Nature Park at the foot of the glacier, said he could see huge blocks of ice flowing down onto the black sand plains.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm looking at an enormous iceberg of several dozen  tonnes being hurled down the sands at enormous speed. You would never believe an iceberg of this size could be carried this far,&quot; he told Icelandic Radio.</p>
<p>The radio said a bridge over the Gigjukvis river had already been wiped out by the black, sulphurous torrent and most others along the 35-km (22-mile) stretch of coastal road were expected to be destroyed.</p>
<p>Preliminary estimates put the stream at between 20 and 30,000 cubic metres of water per second. Most of the bridges were built to stand no more than 15,000 cubic metres a second.</p>
<p>State electricity distributor Landsvirkjun was working to find alternative power supplies to the villages of Vik and Kirkjubaejarklaustur, on the west side of the flooded area, as one of the main power cables began to fail.</p>
<p>Authorities also issued warnings to fishermen not to set nets off south Iceland due to turbulence on the sea bed as the flood waters poured down to the coastline.</p>
<p>The Vatnajokul glacier stretches over 8,300 square kilometres (3,200 sq miles) and has a depth in parts of 1,000 metres (3,000 feet).</p>
<p>It is about 250 km (150 miles) east of Reykjavik and about the same distance south of the Arctic Circle.</p>
