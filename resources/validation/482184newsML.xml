<title>USA: Signs of disease seen in Indiana soft winter wheat.</title>
<headline>Signs of disease seen in Indiana soft winter wheat.</headline>

<p>Indiana's soft red winter wheat crop is showing early signs of disease, and agronmoists fear that continued wet weather will hasten outbreaks and reduce yields, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We can see signs that the disease is present and if the weather conditions continue, it could be a problem,&quot; said Charles Mansfield, an agronomist for Purdue University in southwestern Indiana. &quot;The potential is there, but it is driven mostly by environmental factors.&quot;</p>
<p>The emerging wheat crop in the southern part of the state was showing a higher-than-normal signs of disease inoculum, Mansfield said.</p>
<p>&quot;The potential for disease is relatively high this year,&quot; Mansfield said.</p>
<p>Wet weather and flooding this winter have facilitated the development of disease in the soft red winter wheat crop, agronomists said.</p>
<p>More wet weather during the crop's growing season will leave the crop susceptible to disease like septoria glume blotch and powdery mildew, they said.  </p>
<p>Mansfield said he has seen evidence of septoria glume blotch in southwestern areas of Indiana but not powdery mildew.</p>
<p>Septoria glume blotch affects the plant's foliage and leaves and ultimately reduces yields because it stunts growth, he said.</p>
<p>Wheat diseases generally do not manifest themselves until May or June, when the plant's head emerges and the grain starts to develop, Mansfield said.</p>
<p>Because the wheat crop in Ohio has just started to emerge, agronomists and crop observers there reported no signs of disease yet.</p>
<p>However, the wet winter weather has generated concern.</p>
<p>&quot;Our wheat is just now greening up, and there's not much new tissue to get infected,&quot; said James Beuerlein, agronomist for Ohio State University.</p>
<p>But Beuerlein said the wet winter has also left the Ohio crop vulnerable to fusarium head scab and other fungal diseases if rainy conditions persist through the growing season.</p>
<p>&quot;We're scared to death,&quot; Beurlein said. &quot;There's no resistance, and no fungicides to combat it (head scab).&quot;  </p>
<p>The microorganism that causes head scab in wheat is also responsible for stalk rot in corn, and can be transmitted by wind, Beuerlein said.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the microorganism) tends to be blowing around everywhere,&quot; Beuerlein said.</p>
<p>Head scab can reduce yields by up to 50 percent in some wheat varieties, Beuerlein said.</p>
<p>Evidence of disease in the Ohio soft red winter wheat crop will probably not be seen until later in the growing season, crop observers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're about three of four weeks away from critical disease spread,&quot; said Howard Siegrist, extension agronomist for Ohio State University in central Ohio.</p>
