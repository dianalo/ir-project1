<p>Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said in an interview released on Saturday that he expected European Monetary Union (EMU) to start on time in 1999, but that countries' bookkeeping tricks could endanger the process.</p>
<p>&quot;The starting date is in the (Maastricht) Treaty. And in 1998 we will establish which countries will take part, according to the decision of the European Council...I won't speculate about any delay. I believe the starting date will be adhered to,&quot; he said, according to the text of an interview released ahead of publication on Monday.  </p>
<p>Asked if he did not think about what to do in case there was a postponement, Tietmeyer replied:</p>
<p>&quot;Do I have to reveal all the things I think about if there were to be an accident? You can be sure that we would be flexible enough to find the right way (to deal with it). But it's not up for discussion.&quot;</p>
<p>Tietmeyer was asked what he thought about countries such as Italy and France attempting to fulfil the budgetary criteria for EMU with &quot;bookkeeping tricks&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The European Monetary Institute's report demands that tricks and one-off measures should not count when it comes to evaluating long-term efforts to set public finances to rights,&quot; he replied.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that there would be enormous political pressure in 1998 to accept any bookkeeping measures which helped candidate countries to fulfil the Maastricht criteria.</p>
<p>&quot;For that reason it's all the more important that the heads of the central banks make clear that tricks can endanger the credibility of the whole enterprise,&quot; he said. &quot;That's the only thing we can do.&quot;</p>
<p>Tietmeyer said remaining within the criteria over the long term was more important than fulfilling them in a &quot;one-off effect&quot;.</p>
<p>Asked about Finance Minister Theo Waigel's view that the Maastricht treaty called for countries to get their budget deficits under 3.0 percent of GDP, Tietmeyer replied:</p>
<p>&quot;The treaty says three percent, I don't want to comment on the question of the zero (after the decimal point).&quot;</p>
