<p>Philadelphia's fiscal oversight board released a pessimistic report Wednesday predicting that the city will see continuing declines in economic, population and employment levels.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority, in a paper entitled &quot;Continuing Economic Decline: A Foreboding Future For Philadelphia,&quot; warned that longstanding population and job loss trends are continuing despite the city's successful effort in recent years to regain solvency.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1991 alone the city lost 4.4 percent (32,900) of all its jobs,&quot; PICA said. &quot;Recent data indicate job loss is continuing.&quot;</p>
<p>The report, citing recent Census Bureau figures, said the city is losing on average over 1,800 residents every month, or 425 people a week.</p>
<p>&quot;As people with means move out of the city, they take their income and economic activity with them,&quot; the report said. &quot;The result is a tax revenue loss to the city, not only because taxable wealth is extracted, but also because less money is spent locally.&quot;</p>
<p>That results in a further loss of jobs, which in turn leads to a greater demand on social services, it said.</p>
<p>The trend puts the city's general fund at risk, the report said, calling into question its ability to pay for fundamental government expenses.</p>
<p>Among the other dismal trends cited in the report were Census figures showing that the number jobs in the city has fallen by 250,000 over the last 25 years, to less than 670,000.</p>
<p>Moreover, the population level has dropped 25 percent from its 1950 peak of two million, by far the largest population decline of any of the top 20 counties in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Without a reversal in the city's economy, the city government will find it extremely difficult to meet growing demands and maintain a balanced budget,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>PICA said it will analyze in future reports how it expects the city budget to be directly affected by the trends.</p>
