<p>Mordechai Vanunu might be forgiven for thinking the world had forsaken him.</p>
<p>Lauded by activists the world over for daring to reveal details of Israel's top secret Dimona nuclear plant, Vanunu now sits alone in a tiny cell with no prospect of early release from an 18-year sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;The agent who helped end the Cold War is still in the cold,&quot; he lamented in a poem written last year.</p>
<p>But as the 10th anniversary of his arrest approaches on September 30, campaigners around the world are uniting in a bid to persuade Israeli authorities to free him.</p>
<p>In the forefront is veteran anti-nuclear activist Professor Joseph Rotblat, winner of the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>&quot;I find it hard to understand that a civilised country like Israel could keep a man in solitary confinement for 10 years. It is an act of barbarism,&quot; Rotblat said in an interview.</p>
<p>The Israeli technician was sentenced to 18 years solitary confinement in 1986 for spilling his country's nuclear secrets. Friends worry about the effect of the incarceration on Vanunu and say he is showing signs of paranoia and depression.</p>
<p>Vanunu hit the headlines when he gave London's Sunday Times newspaper photos and details of Dimona, which foreign analysts say has produced at least 200 atomic weapons.</p>
<p>The enraged Israelis, who have never admitted they can make atomic weapons, hit back quickly.</p>
<p>In an episode which could have come straight from the pages of a lurid thriller, Israeli intelligence used a blonde agent to lure Vanunu from Britain to Rome, where he was kidnapped, drugged and shipped home to be tried.</p>
<p>Rotblat said Vanunu had been disproportionately punished, especially considering the treatment meted out to Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs, whose information enabled Moscow to detonate its first nuclear weapon in August 1949.</p>
<p>&quot;Without his information the Russians simply could not have built the nuclear bomb. Fuchs was sentenced to 40 years in jail, where he worked as a librarian, and was released after nine. It was quite humanitarian,&quot; said Rotblat.</p>
<p>&quot;Compare this to Vanunu: people knew about Israel's nuclear capacity in any case. What he said did not damage anyone. By comparison with Fuchs his treatment is unimaginable.&quot;</p>
<p>Rotblat appealed to Israel to release Vanunu when accepting his Nobel award last year. Sources in Norway said Vanunu himself had been nominated for the Peace Prize over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>Israel says it cannot free Vanunu ahead of time because he has threatened to reveal more about Israel's nuclear programme.</p>
<p>But campaigners say the Israelis are worried Vanunu will give more details about his kidnapping and thereby prove the operation broke international laws.</p>
<p>The main focus of the September 30 campaign will be in the United States, where protests are planned in 10 cities from Los Angeles to Washington.</p>
<p>Coordinator Sam Day said a cage representing Vanunu's cell would be placed outside the Israeli embassy in the capital.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a great feeling of outrage around world against Vanunu's continuing imprisonment. We see him as prisoner of conscience and not a spy,&quot; Day said by telephone from Minnesota.</p>
<p>&quot;We also want to send a message that it is by consent of the U.S. government that Israel has a secret nuclear weapons programme,&quot; added Day.</p>
<p>He said he was increasingly worried by Vanunu's recent letters.</p>
<p>&quot;He is very impatient about efforts around the world (to free him). He thinks we should be doing more to build a fire under the government of Israel. The letters seem a little paranoid at times, as if the whole word is out to get him.&quot;</p>
<p>Protestors in Canada will hold vigils and collect petitions in Winnipeg and Toronto on September 30.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe it is of importance for the world to know where nuclear weapons are and to eliminate them as soon as possible. Vanunu provided a service to Israel and the rest of the world,&quot; organiser Mordecai Briemberg said from Vancouver.</p>
<p>&quot;Any movement like this must depend on heightened public awareness and more awareness of the double standards which allow Israel to do things which other countries can't do.&quot;</p>
<p>Campaigners will also stage rallies in Britain and New Zealand, which has banned nuclear weapons from its territory since 1987.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe he was just another peace worker following his conscience and would have hoped that most of us, if we'd had the same amount of courage, would have done likewise,&quot; event coordinator Arthur Quinn said from Wellington.</p>
