<p>Zimbabwe could raise its platinum production to vie with Russia as the the world's second largest producer.</p>
<p>But expansion of production to 500,000 ounces or more per year depends on metal prices strengthening sufficiently to allow development of proposed projects, Derek Bain, chief executive of the country's chamber of mines told Reuters.</p>
<p>South Africa dominates world output, producing more than 3.5 million ounces a year. Russia produces about 700,000 ounces, but its development plans are shrouded in secrecy.</p>
<p>Bain said Zimbabwe had three platinum projects in various stages of feasibility and development, in addition to ZIMASCO's small Mimosa mine and the larger Hartley Platinum.</p>
<p>&quot;We could increase production significantly if all these projects came on line. It could be about 500,000 ounces. It could well be more than that,&quot; Bain said.</p>
<p>Hartley, a joint venture between Delta Gold NL and BHP Ltd, is expected to produce 150,000 ounces of platinum per year when it reaches full production of 180,000 tonnes of ore per month by April.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe Mining and Smelting Company's (ZIMASCO) Mimosa Platinum mine currently produces about 13,000 ounces of platinum per year and could increase this to the same levels as Hartley.</p>
<p>&quot;It has got similar capacity to Hartley. I understand it now produces around 13,000 ounces. It could have throughput of approximately that of Hartley. There would be a variation in the mineral content, but it would be that ballpark,&quot; Bain said.</p>
<p>However, the current weakness in precious metal prices is dampening optimism and could see Zimbabwe delay any proposed projects.</p>
<p>&quot;There are projects in stages of development or feasibility but they have now been put on the back burner for the moment because of prices,&quot; Bain said.</p>
<p>Platinum is trading at around $354 an ounce, at 3-1/4 year lows. &quot;If the platinum price stayed around these levels, any development would be delayed,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>One project being considered was to amalgamate Delta and BHP's Mhondoro Platinum operation with Hartley. This could see platinum output at Hartley double to 300,000 ounces per year.</p>
<p>The Chamber said that Delta itself had further platinum interests it could bring on line.</p>
<p>It also added that Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd was eyeing platinum interests in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>&quot;Anglo is here too,&quot; Bain said.</p>
<p>Asked whether the giant South African platinum producers would show a more active interest in Zimbabwe if the country increased its platinum output, Bain said: &quot; South Africans have always tried to downplay Zimbabwe's platinum production. Naturally they would show interest, but there could be more problems with the European Union.&quot;</p>
<p>The EU scuppered plans to merge Impala Platinum with Lonrho's platinum interests on the grounds that it would be anti-competitive. It has warned Anglo American Platinum against similar plans for Lonrho's platinum.</p>
<p>South African producers already produce about 70 percent of world platinum.</p>
