<headline>U.S. money managers more defensive on US debt-MCM.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. fixed-income managers continued to cut the durations of their U.S. debt portfolios over the past week, according to an MCM MoneyWatch Inc survey.</p>
<p>&quot;Weighted durations fell ... but cash positions dipped,&quot; according to MCM first vice president and senior economist Astrid Adolfson. &quot;The dip may reflect a rise in outflows,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>In the week ended April 14, the survey showed durations as a percentage of benchmark fell to 106.3 percent from 106.9 percent the week before.  </p>
<p>A duration reading above 100 percent indicates the group of investors polled is mostly long on the market.</p>
<p>A portfolio's duration represents its average maturity and is used by portfolio managers to calculate exposure to risk.</p>
<p>In the &quot;next likely move&quot; category, portfolio managers representing 46 percent of total assets in the survey said they would &quot;buy,&quot; compared with 40 percent the prior week.</p>
<p>Strategists leaning toward &quot;sell&quot; fell to 8.0 percent, down from 11 percent in the week ended April 7.</p>
<p>Forty-six percent of managers said they were &quot;neutral&quot; on the market, down from 49 percent a week ago.  </p>
<p>Cash as a percentage of assets fell to 3.36 percent, against 3.51 percent registered the previous week.</p>
<p>The survey showed 31 percent of investors polled overweighted the 10-plus years duration sector, up from 27 percent the previous week, while 10 percent underweighted it. The remaining 59 percent were &quot;neutral.&quot;</p>
<p>In the five- to 10-year duration sector, 44 percent of investors polled said they overweighted the securities and 15 percent underweighted them.  </p>
<p>The survey included 38 domestic participants who manage about $110 billion in fixed-income assets. The poll is conducted weekly by MCM and usually is released on Tuesday.  </p>
