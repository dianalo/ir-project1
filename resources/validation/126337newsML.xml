<p>Moslem deputies elected to a Bosnian Serb assembly said on Friday they would attend its inaugural ceremony this weekend in Serb territory but would refuse to swear an oath of loyalty to the Bible.</p>
<p>Bosnian Serb authorities want all deputies in the Serb republic's newly-elected national assembly to take an oath expressing loyalty to the Serb republic and the Christian scriptures at the ceremony on Saturday.</p>
<p>The 18 Moslem deputies expected to travel to Banja Luka in Serb-controlled territory for the first session said they would avoid declaring allegiance to the Bible.</p>
<p>&quot;Bosnia is a secular state and we ask for religious elements to be erased from the declaration,&quot; said Ismet Grbo, spokesman for the main Moslem Party of Democratic Action (SDA).</p>
<p>Grbo told reporters on Thursday that SDA deputies objected to the oath but were willing to accept a Serb nationalist anthem, &quot;God Give us Justice&quot;, as the music for the ceremony.</p>
<p>&quot;The anthem &quot;God Give us Justice' is not disputable but what is disputable is the text of the oath that is proposed by the Serbs. Our deputies will not accept that solemn declaration.&quot;</p>
<p>After the oath, Grbo said that &quot;it would be possible to constitute the parliament with our participation&quot;.</p>
<p>The Dayton peace accord preserves Bosnia as loose union divided into a Serb republic and a Moslem-Croat federation.</p>
<p>Apart from a central parliament ruling the union, Serb and Moslem-Croat territories have their own regional assemblies.</p>
<p>The Moslem deputies who decide to travel to Banja Luka will be entering a region that became notorious for a Serb campaign of expulsions and terror against Moslems and Croats.</p>
<p>Orthodox Christian Serbs expelled hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholic Croats and Bosnian Moslems from the Banja Luka area during 3-1/2 years of war in a bid to set up a separate state.</p>
<p>This week bulldozers began to level the site of an ancient mosque in Banja Luka that was blown up by Serb nationalists during the war.</p>
<p>Moves to flatten buildings owned by the Moslem community on the site where the Ferhadija Mosque had stood since 1583 seemed designed to frighten Moslem deputies into staying away from Saturday's session, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Moslems were due to depart by bus early on Saturday morning from federation territory and cross into the Serb republic near the town of Jajce, said Colum Murphy, a spokesman for the international High Representative to Bosnia.</p>
<p>Bosnian Serb police and observers from the International Police Task Force would escort the bus to Banja Luka, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as things stand now, we are going to Banja Luka tomorrow morning,&quot; an SDA official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Troops from the NATO-led peace would not be escorting the Moslem representatives to the meeting but would increase the number of patrols &quot;in the general area&quot;, NATO officers said.</p>
<p>In the 83-member Serb national assembly, there are 18 members from the Moslem-Croat federation who were elected by refugees voting by absentee ballot.</p>
<p>Of the 18 Moslems, 14 are members of the SDA, and four others come from two opposition parties.</p>
