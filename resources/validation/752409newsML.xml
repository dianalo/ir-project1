<p>Albania's newly-elected president moved quickly on Thursday to install a government in the lawless Balkan state, asking Socialist Party chairman Fatos Nano to form a cabinet.</p>
<p>Socialist Party spokesman Kastriot Islami said interim premier Bashkim Fino presented his resignation to new president Rexhep Mejdani soon after his election by parliament, and Mejdani then met Nano to give him the mandate as leader of parliament's biggest party.</p>
<p>Albanians enjoyed their first evening free of curfew in almost five months, though the rattle of automatic weapons and the red flicker of tracer fire over Tirana showed security was as precarious as ever.</p>
<p>Large areas of the country, particularly in the south, are at the mercy of armed gangs, and even peaceable citizens keep a looted Kalashnikov at home for self defence.</p>
<p>Parliament voted on Thursday to lift the state of emergency imposed on March 2, and then elected Mejdani, a former physics professor who joined the party only last year.</p>
<p>&quot;I call on all Albanians to help me realise my mission on the difficult road of normalising the life of the country and its institutions,&quot; Mejdani said in his acceptance speech.</p>
<p>&quot;I call on all Albanian immigrants wherever they are to come back and contribute to the reconstruction of Albania.&quot;</p>
<p>Mejdani, a tall, bespectacled 52-year-old, says proudly that he was never a member of the once all-powerful communist party, unlike Nano and outgoing president Sali Berisha, whose Democratic Party suffered a resounding defeat in June 29 elections.</p>
<p>Berisha was initially welcomed for his pro-Western reform policies, but his increasingly authoritarian style lost him support and the collapse of high interest investment schemes early this year proved the final straw.</p>
<p>His government resigned in March at the height of the unrest in which armouries were broken into and weapons and explosives stolen.</p>
<p>The sole candidate for the presidency, Mejdani was elected by 110 votes to three with two abstentions and seven invalid ballots. Parliament voted unanimously to lift the state of emergency, ending a nationwide 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew.</p>
<p>The Democrats boycotted the assembly for a second day to protest at the conduct of the elections but said they opposed both decisions.</p>
<p>The Socialists and their coalition allies have 119 seats in the 155-seat parliament, while the Democrats have 27 deputies, including Berisha.</p>
<p>Parliament elected Social Democratic Party leader Skender Gjinushi, whose party is the Socialists' main coalition ally, as speaker of the assembly.</p>
<p>The 44-year-old Nano, who was jailed on corruption charges that his Socialists say were politically motivated, insists his reformed party has nothing to do with the Stalinist regime of Enver Hoxha which ruled for four decades.</p>
<p>Nano has said he will form a five-party coalition government. The new cabinet lineup is expected to be presented to parliament on Friday.</p>
<p>Apart from restoring law and order, the main task of Nano's government will be to resolve the economic chaos left by the collapse of the pyramid schemes and put the impoverished Balkan country on the road to reconstruction and modernisation.</p>
<p>His party campaigned in part on a promise to compensate pyramid investors who lost their life savings.</p>
