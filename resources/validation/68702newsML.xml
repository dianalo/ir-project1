<p>The disclosure that Boris Yeltsin had another, unreported,  heart attack during this year's presidential election carries wide-ranging implications for Russia and the Kremlin leader's future as head of state.</p>
<p>It increases fears that he may not survive a forthcoming heart operation which his doctors had originally said would be a straightforward bypass. It also gives critics grounds to argue his re-election to the Kremlin was not fair.</p>
<p>The surgeon, who dropped the bombshell in an interview with U.S. television channel ABC on Friday, zeroed in on the dilemma Yeltsin faced after his third heart attack which occurred before the July 3 runoff in the two-round election.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you imagine what would happen, for example, if he told everyone he's had a heart attack and he's unable to work?&quot; Renat Akchurin told ABC when asked why no-one had said anything at the time.</p>
<p>During the campaign, communist challenger Gennady Zyuganov had tried to convince voters that the two heart attacks the 65-year-old Yeltsin suffered last year made him unfit to rule.</p>
<p>He was foiled by Yeltsin's surprisingly energetic election campaign, in which he danced the twist, swung on a swing and was generally transformed from the puffy-faced, slurring figure who had sparked rumours of failing health and heavy drinking.</p>
<p>Then Yeltsin suddenly dropped out of sight after beating Zyuganov in the June 16 first round.</p>
<p>&quot;They are suggesting we vote for a living corpse,&quot; Zyuganov backer Stanislav Govorukhin said after Yeltsin appeared briefly on television just ahead of the poll looking stiff and awkward.</p>
<p>The president did not even appear in public to vote in the second round on July 3, but despite Zyuganov's demand for an official report on his health, Kremlin aides got away with dismissing his ailment variously as a sore throat or a cold.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was one of many officials who successfully managed to play the issue down, ensuring the president's victory in the second round.</p>
<p>On July 1, Chernomyrdin was asked whether Yeltsin had suffered a new heart attack. &quot;I noticed no sign of any attack,&quot; he answered, saying he had met Yeltsin earlier in the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) has a cold, but his voice improved today,&quot; Chernomyrdin told a news conference, adding that the Kremlin leader's handshake was so firm he had nearly torn his hand off when greeting him.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation in the country is normal, nothing unexpected, unforeseen or extravagant is taking place,&quot; Chernomyrdin said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything will be all right.&quot;</p>
<p>A presidential official refused to comment on Saturday on the heart attack report, which came amid a sudden shift in Kremlin policy towards more openness about Yeltsin's health.</p>
<p>The president himself said on television on September 5 that he would have heart surgery at the end of the month.</p>
<p>His doctors said it would be straightforward bypass, but on Friday the head of the Kremlin medical centre said the operation was &quot;very serious&quot; and that Yeltsin was staying in hospital to ensure problems with other organs did not complicate surgery.</p>
<p>Akchurin, who had earlier refused requests for interviews, spent Friday giving a series of interviews. While he told other news organisations he could not comment on the president's health, when ABC asked him whether the president had had a heart attack he said: &quot;Yes. End of June or July.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if it was before the second round he said: &quot;In fact you can see it on the ECG (electrocardiogram).&quot;</p>
<p>Leading U.S. cardiologist Michael DeBakey, who will arrive in Moscow on Monday and consult on Yeltsin's case, told ABC that a third heart attack could make surgery more complicated.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a possibility that each attack damages the heart a little more,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Although the cover-up of the heart attack may be criticised by the communists, it would not have actually infringed the law. Nor is it clear its disclosure would have handed victory to Zyuganov, who finished more than 13 percentage points behind.</p>
<p>Many voters were aware not all was well with the president's health and millions voted for him not because they felt he was a good or even entirely competent leader but through fear of a return to the communist past, played up in Yeltsin's campaign.</p>
<p>However, talk of a Kremlin cover-up will do Zyuganov no harm. He made clear on Friday that he would be back to challenge for power at the earliest opportunity.</p>
