<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-11-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Donnkenney Inc shareholder has filed a suit in federal court charging violations of federal securities law, the plantiff's law firm said.</p>
<p>Kaplan, Kilsheimer &amp; Fox LLP said a class action has been commenced in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all purchasers of Donnkenny common during the period February 14, 1995, through November 6, 1996.</p>
<p>The complaint charges Donnkenny and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the federal securities laws by allegedly misrepresenting and concealing material facts concerning financial statements and results.  </p>
<p>Donnkenny officials were not available to comment on the law firm's statement.</p>
<p>The complaint asserts, among other things, that reported financial results for at least the years ended in early December 1994 and 1995 and quarters ended March 2 and June 1, 1996 materially misstated revenues, net income and earnings per share.</p>
<p>In a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated October 15, the firm said, Donnkenny said its Audit Committee was reviewing the circumstances that led to the company's September 6 Form 8-K disclosure that it would have to restate certain previously issued results.  </p>
<p>Based on the preliminary results of that review the, company reported, certain revenues and earnings reported in fiscal 1994 should be reflected in fiscal 1995, certain sales and costs of sales in fiscal 1995 need correction and previously issued financial statements should no longer be relied upon.</p>
<p>On November 7, based on the preliminary results of the investigation, Donnkenny reassigned its controller and assistant controller to non-financial responsibilities and replaced its chief financial officer, the firm said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the company announced that KPMG Peat Marwick had resigned as auditors and had been replaced by Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP.</p>
<p>The firm said the plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of Donnkenny common during the class period. -- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610.</p>
