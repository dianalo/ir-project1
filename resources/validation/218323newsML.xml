<p>The World Jewish Congress (WJC) said on Tuesday it would take its search for the unclaimed wealth of Holocaust victims to Sweden, which it said bought gold from Nazi Germany during World War Two.</p>
<p>WJC Secretary-General Israel Singer said he would travel to Stockholm on Wednesday for &quot;an opening discussion&quot; with Swedish government officials on questions of restitution of Jewish property.</p>
<p>He was speaking to reporters on the final day of a two-day WJC meeting in Oslo which made plans to penetrate Swiss bank secrecy and to find out what happened to the wealth of Jewish victims of Nazi terror in other European countries, including neutral Sweden.</p>
<p>&quot;I am going to talk to the Swedes about the general principle of heirless property that arrived in neutral countries, including Sweden, during the war,&quot; Singer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold is only one of the subjects that we will be discussing. There were other kinds of heirless property which were sent by (Nazi) looters to Sweden. And Sweden, a neutral country, decided in those days to act as a banking centre for all kinds of property.&quot;</p>
<p>In Stockholm, a Foreign Ministry official said Singer would meet briefly with Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Singer said documents showed some parallels between Sweden and neutral Switzerland, which is said to have laundered hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen assets, including gold taken from the teeth of Holocaust victims and from the central banks of German-occupied Europe.</p>
<p>Neither Sweden nor Switzerland were invaded by the Nazis.</p>
<p>&quot;We have reason to believe the Swedish government wants to deal with this matter in a correct way -- the way the Norwegians have dealt with it now that it was brought to their attention,&quot; Singer said.</p>
<p>WJC leaders praised Norway for its commitment to resolving the issue of restitution. The government last March appointed a committee and gave it one year to map out wartime claims by Jews in Norway, which was occupied by the Nazis in 1940.</p>
<p>Singer said he wanted the Swedes to form a similar committee &quot;to try to find out what happened together with us&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't think we are going to have to go through the same difficulties that we had in Switzerland,&quot; Singer said. &quot;We hope not at least.&quot;</p>
<p>An independent committee was formed in May by the WJC and Swiss bankers after accusations that Swiss banks profited cynically from the Holocaust and then stonewalled relatives trying to find family members' wealth.</p>
<p>Swiss banks denied the charges, but agreed to the probe.</p>
<p>Singer would not estimate how much unclaimed wealth was in Sweden now, but declassified Allied documents released by WJC officials showed that Sweden's central bank bought gold worth $18.5 million in war-time money from the Nazi Reichbank.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe it is safe to assume that some of the gold came from individuals, including Holocaust victims,&quot; a WJC official said.</p>
