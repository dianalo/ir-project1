<p>Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan said the country's trade deficit was reassuring when compared with that of other countries, a financial newspaper said.</p>
<p>He said the trade gap for 1996 should be around three percent of gross domestic product (GDP), which was relatively low compared with rates of up to eight percent in other countries, Gazeta Mercantil said.</p>
<p>Malan said the profile of imports, which was largely the same, also had to be considered. He said the only item with an exceptional month-on-month rise was oil, up 50 percent in September, Gazeta said.</p>
<p>Brazil's trade accounts posted a surprisingly high $655 million gap in September. Many economists said the deficit could widen another $1 billion in October, which could take the year-end deficit to about $4 billion.</p>
<p>Last week, the government revealed disappointing exports of $4.188 billion in October, up from $4.115 billion in September but down from October 1995's $4.405 billion.</p>
