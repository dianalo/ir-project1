<headline>Metals end jumpy LME mostly steady, off highs.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-27</dateline>

<p>Base metal markets were flighty during Thursday LME trading, with clear trends difficult to discern, and prices largely finished off their highs after a see-sawing session.</p>
<p>Traders said there was a feeling that some markets like copper and nickel were over-extended and ripe for a solid downside reaction. But with funds picking off price dips, there was little substance to declines.</p>
<p>So, during the session, nickel notched up a new nine-month high, zinc neared its recent two-year peak, while copper and aluminium showed signs of approaching Wednesday's high-points. However, the lack of follow-through at the highs eventually induced modest retreats.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment it is the funds that are holding things up -- we are not seeing anything physical,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Copper was largely on the defensive, apart from spells of covering which foundered just above $2,400 with producers looking to lock in forward sales. There was also some lending of the spreads, although the premiums mostly held steady. Stocks on Friday are expected to register a decline, some said.</p>
<p>Last Thursday business was at $2,393 a tonne, up just $1 from the previous kerb, but well below the $2,412 peak.</p>
<p>Aluminium probed above the $1,660 level intermittently, but ran into profit-taking and speculative selling. Last trade was at $1,652, a $13 loss from the previous kerb.</p>
<p>Nickel prices flew around in their usual volatile fashion, at one point hitting fresh nine-month highs of $8,180 when buy-stops were triggered above $8,100, traders said.</p>
<p>Underpinning the market are flurries of fund interest, as well as the rumblings from Russia's Norilsk, where strike action is a possibility. But the thinness of the market was accentuated by late action, with prices easing back to close the kerb at $8,070, still up $20.</p>
<p>The zinc market showed signs at one stage of testing the recent two-year peak of $1,235 before prices hurriedly re-traced with copper. Last business was at $1,227, a $5 gain from Wednesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Swiss commodity trader Glencore continued to strengthen its profile in the market by increasing its stake in France's Metaleurop.</p>
<p>Lead was mostly subdued throughout the session, until late covering helped raise values from overnight levels. By the end of the kerb the market was $10 higher at $675.</p>
<p>Tin conditions were patchy, with some fund interest and end-user enquiry circulating. Again, a late flurry of buying lifted prices to the day's high with last business at $5,880, up $39.</p>
<p>A quiet alloy market was largely stable, and traded last at an unchanged $1,550 a tonne.</p>
