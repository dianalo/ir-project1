<p>Irish bonds drifted off amid light trade on Monday, lacking direction and affected by gloom in international bond markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a quiet week ahead in terms of news, and spirits in bond markets generally are low,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;With cumulative uncertainties beneath the surface - in the form of continuing interest rate fears, French election worries, and so on - people's hearts aren't really in it.&quot;</p>
<p>European bonds and shares sank in early Monday trade as investors grew unsettled by the prospect of a snap French election, the result of which could determine the outlook for European monetary union.</p>
<p>Worries seeped into gilts and futures, which were marked down at the open; German Bunds were also depressed by technical factors.</p>
<p>Dealers said that in the absence of other news, markets were following the tone set by France, with not much to go on until UK retail sales figures and a gilt auction by the Bank of England on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Bank of England will be auctioning 2.0 billion stg of 7.0 percent gilts due 2002 whilst the Office for National Statistics will be publishing crucial March retail sales data. Retail sales are expected to show slower consumer spending.</p>
<p>At home the Central Statistics Office on Friday is due to release the final retail sales index for January and the provisional figures for February. No major U.S. numbers are scheduled for this week.</p>
<p>On the Irish market at 1500 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was down 29 pence from Friday's close at 101.86 to yield 6.00 percent while the key benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 eased 40 pence to 108.35 to yield 6.75 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said Irish bonds were yielding 146 basis points over German bunds in the five-year area, and 90 basis points over bunds in the 10-year area.</p>
