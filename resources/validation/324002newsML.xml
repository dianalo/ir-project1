<title>SOUTH AFRICA: DEMOCRATS TO CONSIDER CABINET ROLE IF MANDELA ASKS.</title>

<p>The leader of South Africa's small liberal Democratic Party declined on Wednesday to say if President Nelson Mandela had offered him a cabinet job, but said he would take such an offer seriously.</p>
<p>The Business Day newspaper reported on Wednesday that Mandela discussed the possibility of a cabinet position with the party's leader, Tony leon, at a Saturday meeting.</p>
<p>Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, confirmed only that the two had met on Saturday.</p>
<p>Leon, saying he would not reveal the substance of his talks with Mandela, told Reuters: &quot;Speaking purely theoretically, an offer to join a government has to be taken very seriously.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not something that I would dismiss out of hand, but it's not something that I would accept without qualification and very serious thought.&quot;</p>
<p>Mandela offered the small leftist Pan Africanist Congress a place in the cabinet last week, which the party's leader said he had accepted in principle, though more talks were needed.</p>
<p>Mankahlana said Mandela would talk to other opposition leaders before he opens parliament on February 7, as part of a regular consultation with South Africa's six opposition parties who, together, control 148 of the 400 National Assembly seats.</p>
<p>Mandela's cabinet already includes three members of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, which seeks virtual autonomy for the mainly Zulu KwaZulu-Natal province.</p>
<p>Former president F.W. de Klerk's National Party quit the transitional coalition at the end of June, saying their views were not being taken seriously.</p>
<p>The National Party and Inkatha won the right to cabinet seats in South Africa's first democratic election in 1994, polling 20 percent and 10 percent respectively of the votes.</p>
<p>Sources in Mandela's African National Congress said he had not formally tabled a proposal to offer cabinet seats to minority parties. They said he would not be obliged to consult his party about cabinet nominations.</p>
<p>But one political source said Mandela, who has made unity and reconciliation the theme of his presidency, wanted to avoid racial polarisation in politics and would try to give black and white opposition parties a role in his government.</p>
<p>The source said Mandela was willing to consider cabinet positions for the Democratic Party, the Pan Africanist Congress and, possibly, the white-separatist Freedom Front.</p>
<p>An ANC source said Mandela regarded Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen, a former commander of South Africa's armed forces, as a key to reconciliation between the black majority and the white Afrikaners who oppressed them for decades.</p>
<p>Mandela's move follows overtures by de Klerk to the Democratic Party and Inkatha about an anti-ANC alliance ahead of the next general election in 1999.</p>
<p>A successful NP-led alliance could see mainly white parties forming a conservative alliance against the ANC and the black supremacist Pan Africanist Congress.</p>
