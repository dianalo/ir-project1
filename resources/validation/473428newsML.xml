<title>FRANCE: France's Tapie on trial for tax fraud over yacht.</title>
<headline>France's Tapie on trial for tax fraud over yacht.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-03-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bankrupt French business tycoon Bernard Tapie, who is already serving an eight-month jail term for rigging a soccer match, appealed on Thursday against a six-month sentence for tax evasion in the management of his luxury yacht.</p>
<p>In his first public appearance since he was jailed almost two months ago, the flamboyant former minister appealed against the sentence for passing off the majestic 74-metre (245 ft), four-mast ship Phocea as a means of promoting his business, although he was its only beneficiary.</p>
<p>Television crews and photographers were banned from the courtroom.</p>
<p>Tapie, 54, has tumbled from political and business stardom since 1993, when he rigged a league match to give his team Marseille an easy game before their successful European Cup final against AC Milan.</p>
<p>The $11 million yacht, which at the height of Tapie's rise to wealth and fame was moored proudly in the old port of Marseille, has been seized and is on sale.</p>
<p>Tapie has been declared bankrupt and ineligible for public office and banned from running a business. He has lost his seats in the French and European parliaments.</p>
<p>His Paris mansion has also been seized and his furniture was sold earlier this week, netting 4.2 million francs ($740,000) for his creditors.</p>
