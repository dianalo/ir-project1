<title>CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: Bangui army dissidents start to rejoin units.</title>

<p>Army dissidents in the Central African Republic capital Bangui began rejoining their units on Thursday under a peace deal brokered by Mali's former military leader Amadou Toumani Toure, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The return of the dissidents, involved in a week of bloody clashes with African peacekeepers in June, sets a January peace deal back on track. That deal was designed to end three army mutinies in under a year.</p>
<p>Supporters and opponents of President Ange-Felix Patasse attended a reconciliation ceremony on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The return of the dissidents and their weapons began from Petevo suburb, a southern stronghold of the dissidents, and from Camp Kassai, their stronghold in the east. Peacekeepers accompanied them.</p>
<p>The mutinies began over pay and conditions but turned into a bid to topple Patasse, a northern civilian elected in 1993. They degenerated in ethnic killings. Most mutineers were from the Yakoma tribe of former military leader Andre Kolingba.</p>
<p>The Red Cross says at least 100 people died in the June clashes and an estimated 60,000 civilians fled the capital. Some have since returned home.</p>
<p>Under the latest deal Toumani Toure and Jean-Marc Simon, the ambassador of France, the former colonial power, undertook to guarantee the dissidents' security.</p>
<p>France intervened in January under a defence pact to halt fighting and then handed over to the peacekeepers.</p>
