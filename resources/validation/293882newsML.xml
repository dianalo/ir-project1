<p>President Clinton will gather his old and new Cabinet members and senior White House aides for an &quot;organizing session&quot; Saturday, his spokesman said Wednesday.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters the meeting, originally set for Saturday and Sunday at the Camp David presidential retreat, was shortened to one day and moved to Washington because of the tight schedules of new Cabinet members who are preparing for Senate confirmation hearings.</p>
<p>The spokesman, who described the meeting as an &quot;organizing session for the work ahead in the second term,&quot; suggested some officials were not unhappy it was curtailed because this would allow them to watch Sunday's football playoff games.</p>
<p>Although the gathering echoes a Camp David session the president held in 1993 for his top aides at the start of his first term, McCurry suggested the meeting would be more tightly focused, with specific issues to be discussed.</p>
<p>The 1993 gathering startled some participants because of its emphasis on drawing officials together by discussing their personal histories rather than by focusing on public policy.</p>
<p>McCurry said the meeting was to take place at Blair House, the presidential guest house accross from the White House.</p>
