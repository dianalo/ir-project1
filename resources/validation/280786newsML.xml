<title>EGYPT: Pachin share offer subscribed 2.15 times.</title>
<headline>Pachin share offer subscribed 2.15 times.</headline>

<p>An offer of more than 1.3 million shares in the state-dominated company Pachin/Paints and Chemical Industries was subscribed more than twice over, a spokesman for the agents said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It was covered about 2.15 times,&quot; said a spokesman at Commercial International Investment Company (CIIC).</p>
<p>The state's Holding Company for Chemical Industries, which owns 87.5 percent of the 10 million shares in Pachin, had offered 1.3125 million shares by auction at a minimum price of 137.99 pounds a share. The deadline for bids was December 25.</p>
<p>The CIIC spokesman said he could give no more details of the Pachin auction at least until Tuesday.</p>
<p>He also said he expected strong demand for shares in Cairo Precision Industries, which is raising capital by 25 million pounds ($7.4 million) by selling new shares to the public.</p>
<p>The company will start accepting applications for 60 days from January 5 but the offer could close at the end of the statutory minimum period of 10 days.</p>
<p>An announcement in Egyptian newspapers had erroneously said that the offer would open on December 24.</p>
<p>&quot;It is expected to be 10 to 15 times oversubscribed,&quot; the CIIC spokesman said. Cairo Precision Industries is one of the few established Egyptian private companies to open up through a share issue to the public.</p>
