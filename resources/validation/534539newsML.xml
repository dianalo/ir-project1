<headline>Southern Peru up despite lower copper price.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-24</dateline>

<p>Southern Peru Copper Corp net earnings rose to $55.8 million, $0.70 per share, in the first quarter from $49.1 million, $0.61 per share, a year ago despite lower copper prices.</p>
<p>The average price for copper on the London Metal Exchange was $1.10 per pound compared with $1.17.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase in earnings resulted primarily from the company's price protection program, a reduction in our effective tax rate due to a reinvestment incentive in Peru, and a favourable adjustment to provisionally priced sales made in the fourth quarter of 1996,&quot; said CEO Charles Preble.  </p>
<p>The earnings include pretax gains of $5.6 million on sales of copper put options in 1996 covering the first quarter and Southern Peru has realized $16.7 million before tax from its hedging program from July 1 last year to March 31.</p>
<p>It said that price adjustments for copper shipped in the fourth quarter of last year increased sales by $9.4 million and net earnings by $6.3 million.</p>
<p>Average molyblendum prices were $4.38 per pound against $3.97 and silver was $5.01 an ounce against $5.54 a year ago.</p>
<p>Copper sales were 172,000 pounds, up from 169,000 pounds, while silver slid to 679,000 ounces from 819,000 and molyblendum rose to 2,234,000 pounds from 1,867,000.</p>
<p>Sales rose to $214.8 million from $196.4 million.</p>
<p>The reinvesment tax benefit from Peru has added $5.0 million to net earnings, the company said.</p>
<p>Southern Peru said its $600 million loan facility agreed earlier this year is expected to increase annual copper production by 19 percent, 130 million pounds, by early 1999.</p>
<p>ASARCO Inc owns 54.1 percent of SPCC, Marmon Corp 14.2 percent and Phelps Dodge Corp 13.9 percent. ((-- New York Newsroom 212 859 1902))</p>
