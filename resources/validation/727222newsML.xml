<headline>Algiers bomb kills 21 after weekend slaughter.</headline>

<p>A bomb ripped through an Algiers market crowded with women shoppers and children on Monday, killing 21 people and wounding about 40, Algerian state-run radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the dead are women and children,&quot; one resident told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>The explosion, blamed by Algerian security forces on Moslem militants, followed a bloody weekend of massacres and the kidnapping of young girls reported by two of Algeria's leading newspapers.</p>
<p>In these attacks at least 44 people were killed, their throats slit or being hacked to death, and 21 girls from one village dragged off by rebels, probably to serve as &quot;temporary brides&quot;.</p>
<p>Algerian security forces said the bomb exploded around 11.15 a.m. (1015 GMT) in the weekly market held in Baraki, a southern suburb of the capital.</p>
<p>As rescue workers struggled to help victims, security forces said 11 people had died. The toll, carried on the official news agency APS, was soon revised to 21 dead, still with 40 wounded.</p>
<p>The authorities termed the bombing a &quot;criminal act&quot; -- their usual term for violence they blame on Moslem rebels.</p>
<p>The attack came one day after Algeria's authorities vowed to enforce security measures in public places.</p>
<p>These -- making compulsory the searching of people and cars entering public places and of passengers on trains and buses -- were decided last month after a spate of bomb attacks but only loosely implemented.</p>
<p>Monday's bomb was the second within a week in Algiers. Last Wednesday, a bomb wounded 20 people watching an afternoon show in Le Musset Cinema in Belouizdad, a central district of Algiers.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, two Algerian newspapers said suspected Moslem militants had killed at least 44 villagers at the weekend.</p>
<p>El Watan daily, well informed on security matters, said around 20 Moslem rebels attacked Fetha village, near Ksar el Boukhari, southwest of Algiers, over Saturday-Sunday night.</p>
<p>They killed 33 members of five families, including 14 women and four adolescents, the paper said.</p>
<p>&quot;This attack was apparently led by a terrorist group to take revenge on a dissident (rebel) faction,&quot; the paper said.</p>
<p>It added: &quot;The day before the attack, the body of a peasant was found. He had been kidnapped, tortured and decapitated in Ksar el Boukhari area.&quot;</p>
<p>Algeria's main Arabic language newspaper El Kbabar said the rebels used knives or axes to cut the throats or stab to death the villagers. The rebels dragged off with them 21 young girls from the village, it said.</p>
<p>Scores of girls, including teenagers as young as 13, have been kidnapped by fundamentalist rebels to serve the men as &quot;temporary brides&quot; in the bush.</p>
<p>Few of the girls are ever reported to return safely. Last week six women, the youngest 13 and the oldest 28, were reported taken from one family south of Algiers. They are believed to be still missing.</p>
<p>El Khabar said seven more people were killed on Saturday night in a nearby village, Douar Aziz, and four more in Douar Barague. All the communities lie in Ksar el Boukhari area, some 100 km (60 miles) southwest of Algiers.</p>
<p>It was not clear if the deaths of the seven from Douar Aziz were the same as seven reported killed by El Watan which said seven bodies had been found in Taza forest in the same area and that the villagers had been killed at a fake road block.</p>
<p>There was no official confirmation of the reports but foreign diplomats and security experts say the fact the heavily controlled newspapers carry them without apparent sanction, is seen as tacit confirmation.</p>
<p>Violence has shaken Algeria for nearly six years, erupting after the authorities in January 1992 cancelled a general election in which Islamic fundamentalists had taken a huge lead.</p>
<p>About 60,000 people have since been killed.</p>
<p>Last June 5, Algeria held fresh general elections which the authorities hoped would be a major step to ending the violence.</p>
<p>Algerian newspapers since then have reported nearly 400 people being killed, and one Member of Parliament told the assembly last week that 1,000 people had died in the period from the ballot.</p>
