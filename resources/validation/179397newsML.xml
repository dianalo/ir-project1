<p>Arctic winds whipped up snow squalls off the Great Lakes and dumped up to two feet (.6 metre) of snow on parts of Ohio, Michigan and New York, knocking out power to thousands and closing schools on Monday.</p>
<p>Plows were out in force across the Lake Erie coastal city of Cleveland, where about one foot (.3 metre) of heavy, wet snow snapped tree limbs and coated power lines. About 100,000 homes were without power, a city spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had most schools close, although many were already closed for the (Veterans Day) holiday. And some people stayed home from work,&quot; said Latisha James, a press aide to Mayor Michael White.</p>
<p>The thick &quot;lake effect&quot; snow that began over the weekend could continue through early Wednesday but was concentrated over a few miles -- and sometimes just a few hundred yards (metres) -- of coastline. The phenomenom occurs when cold air blows over the relatively warm Great Lakes and forms low-level clouds that release the moisture in the form of thick snow.</p>
<p>Around two feet (.6 metres) of snow inundated the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as the cold air swept across Lake Superior. Squalls that formed over Lake Ontario dumped snow on a band of New York State from Syracuse to Watertown, forecasters said.</p>
<p>A few inches (centimetres) accumulated at higher elevations across Pennsylvania and coated approaches to the Appalachian Mountains as far South as Georgia. &quot;It's like taking a garden hose and spraying it; the intensity gets weaker the further you get from the hose,&quot; meteorologist Dave Taylor of Weather Services Inc. said.</p>
