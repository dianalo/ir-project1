<p>Shares at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on Tuesday trimmed morning gains, but ended mostly higher than Friday's closing at the start of a new trade account, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market opened higher, but there was little fund activity,&quot; said Hitesh Shah, a dealer at local brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher.</p>
<p>Traders said lack of follow-up buying by funds after speculators built up fresh positions in the new account limited the stocks rally.</p>
<p>The market was closed on Monday for a religious holiday.  </p>
<p>End-account considerations at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) put some pressure on prices, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a lot of squaring up activity at the NSE. Many BSE prices were ruling higher compared to the NSE rates,&quot; said Rasesh Maniar, a dealer at brokers Mukesh Babu.</p>
<p>Weekly carryforward charges at the BSE averaged nearly 1.5-2.0 percent a month last Saturday against 3.5 percent the previous week, prompting speculators to take fresh positions in early morning trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>The low charges indicated that players have reduced their over-bought positions, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Overseas telecommunications monopoly Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) ended 84.75 rupees up at 1,070. Volumes were driven by speculators who expected investors to bid in the stock after VSNL's GDR issue was oversubscribed on Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>VSNL on Monday said its GDR issue had been priced at $13.93 per GDR, or 1,000 rupees per VSNL share. The issue had been oversubscribed about 10 times, the telecom firm added.</p>
<p>Market regulator Securities &amp; Exchange Board of India was unlikely to make major announcements about a revised carry forward trading system to be discussed at a meeting on Wednesday, market sources said.</p>
