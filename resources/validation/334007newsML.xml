<p>Silicon Graphics Inc Chairman and CEO Edward McCracken said the company will compete aggressively with its products, on price as well as on performance, with its newly-introduced product lines.</p>
<p>McCracken said in a news conference introducing the company's new Octane line of workstations that the fact so many of its newly-introduced products have been sold out as it gears up production indicates the demand for them.</p>
<p>For example, he said the startup of its manufacturing of its new lower-end O2 desktop computers was its fastest ever, and he expects to have shipped 20,000 by the end of February.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're gaining market share and we're doing it with the best products in the marketplace,&quot; McCracken said in the briefing, which was also broadcast over the Internet and by teleconference to reporter and analysts.</p>
<p>McCracken disputed concerns among some industry analysts that Silicon Graphics faces mounting pressure from ever more powerful personal computers based on Intel Corp processors and Microsoft Corp's Windows and Windows NT.  &quot;If you strapped a rocket on a basset hound, it's still a dog with a rocket on its back,&quot; McCracken said of competition from PCs, frequently referred to as the Wintel platform.  </p>
<p>McCracken and other Silicon Graphics executives described how Octane's new seven-port crossbar switch provides up to 10 times more bandwidth than more traditional architectures, including the technology used within personal computers.</p>
<p>Dan Vivoli, vice president of marketing at Silicon Graphics, said the Octane machines are at &quot;the strike zone of our product line,&quot; adding that personal computers cannot be designed with the speedy internal technology SGI uses.</p>
<p>&quot;This technology is like replacing party line phones with personal phones,&quot; said McCracken, who also demonstrated advanced computing graphics capabilities for the future.  </p>
<p>Intel Corp CEO Andy Grove at the Comdex trade show in November provided a similar example of graphics applications that will be able to run on Intel-based machines in around three years.  Silicon Graphics has frequently said it will not stand still, but will keep pushing technology further.</p>
<p>Silicon Graphics said in reporting its fiscal second quarter earnings last week that it had sold around 10,000 of its new O2 entry-level workstations in the quarter.</p>
<p>McCracken said the company expects to ship another 10,000 by the end of February, &quot;which gives us the whole month of March to do better than that.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Nintendo 64 is a sold-out item,...the O2 is a sold-out item.  The Onyx 2 is a sold-out item. the Origin 200 and Origin 2000 are sold-out items,&quot; McCracken said. &quot;Like Nintendo Co Ltd ), we just cannot build them fast enough.&quot;</p>
<p>The company has said delays in gearing up production of its new products amid the broadest product launch in its history contributed to a shortfall in its December quarter results.</p>
<p>McCracken said the company is committed to competing on price as well as the performance of its computers.</p>
<p>&quot;We're a more aggressive company these days.  We're also willing to compete on the basis of price,&quot; McCracken said.</p>
