<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian All Ordinaries share index (Friday close 2355.0) reached the top of its bull channel last week and came off as profit takers entered the market.</p>
<p>Traders are expected to target the lower retracement levels as potential re-entry points while the bull channel holds.</p>
<p>The short term technicals are bullish.</p>
<p>The leading indicators are suggesting a correction and retracement, with the RSI moving sideways and the ROC and Stochastic both heading lower.</p>
<p>Conservative traders are seen waiting until the Stochastic indicators are both below 80, currently at 79/84, before selling.</p>
<p>This could happen as early as the end of business on Monday.</p>
<p>The 1993 high at 2,350, has been broken, and while the index remains above this level, traders are confortable holding long positions.</p>
<p>With higher targets possible, short term traders are likely however, to look at potential retracement levels of 2,350, 2,340 and 2,330 to re-enter the market long.</p>
<p>However, if 2,340 breaks, it will increase the chances that the medium term retarcement will be reached. These are still within the overall bull trend.</p>
<p>In the medium term, the index has broken its resistance, and while it remains above 2,340 traders are keen to remain long.</p>
<p>With four consistent weeks up, traders will become cautious of a retracement and consolidation.</p>
<p>Medium term Fibonacci retarcements are 2,317, 2,297 and 2,277. The latter being the 2nd major medium term support level.</p>
<p>Medium term technicals are sounding a bullish note of caution. The moving average are all bullish, while the leading indicators are moving sideways and in the overbought region.</p>
<p>Traders are generally likely to wait for these latter indicators to move lower, or will be protecting long positions if the index falls below 2,340.</p>
<p>In the longer term, the index is in the overall bull market. 2,350 has been a previous top, and while the index remains above this level traders arewill also be comfortable about holding long positions.</p>
<p>Longer term technicals are bullish. But as with the shorter time frames, a retracement and consolidation is looming.</p>
<p>The index has been in a sound rally, and with all the leading technicals pointing to an overbought situation, traders will most likely introduce profit retention strategies.</p>
<p>It is most likley that the daily Stochastic and the 2,340 level will become significant over the coming week.</p>
<p>A decline through this level is likely to induce some further profit taking.</p>
<p>The index is still however cautiously bullish.</p>
