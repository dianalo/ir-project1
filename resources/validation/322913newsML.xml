<p>Hundreds of staff holding the boss of French bank Credit Foncier hostage vowed to keep up their siege of the Paris headquarters for a fifth day on Tuesday as unions prepared to meet a government-appointed mediator.</p>
<p>&quot;For the moment there's no question of a plan to end the occupation or holding of (chairman Jerome) Meyssonnier,&quot; staff union representative Claude Dubeau, told Reuters.</p>
<p>French newspapers said on Tuesday that Prime Minister Alain Juppe's decision to intervene and appoint a mediator could break the deadlock with unions fighting government plans to shut down the property loans bank. But Dubeau said that was premature.</p>
<p>About three hundred people were occupying the central lobby of the plush Paris headquarters early on Tuesday, many of them having spent the night there sprawled across the marble floor of the giant atrium in sleeping bags.</p>
<p>Dubeau said a union negotiators would meet before talks at 0930 GMT with go-between Philippe Rouvillois, former head of France's SNCF state railways, but they wanted serious discussion of alternatives to the dismantling of Credit Foncier.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going there with an open mind but it's clear we're not going in there to just hear an explanation of the Arthuis plan,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Arthuis announced in July that part of the debt-laden group would be spun off to another cooperatively run group called Credit Immobilier, which would take on 1,500 of the staff, with the rest shunted into a new state holding company to be gradually closed down.</p>
<p>But he is now facing blanket media coverage of the plight of some 3,300 staff at a time of record unemployment and the thorny task of sorting out a bank which was set up by emperor Napoleon III 145 years ago and has a long history of providing low-cost housing loans to France's poorer families.</p>
<p>After a fourth night sleeping in his office, Meyssonnier, who initially took a conciliatory line but said on Monday he considered himself a hostage, faced another day of mediation talks which were expected to drag on for some time.</p>
<p>More than a thousand staff took part in the occupation on Monday, with employees pouring in from around the country to keep the vigil going as the protestors took turns singing, chanting and preparing food for their colleagues.</p>
<p>Keen to keep public opinion on their side, the staff have also kept branches of Credit Foncier open for business.</p>
<p>While Arthuis has insisted that there will be no money from the government to recussitate the bank, his statements over recent days have become more nuanced as he argues that he is merely dealing with the only proposal available to him.</p>
<p>One of the most controversial issues, however, is that after a loss of nearly 11 billion francs in 1995 -- which triggered the break-up plan, Meyssonnier himself has said the bank could make a profit this year of one billion francs this year.</p>
<p>Moreover, unions constantly point out that the government, and in particular the finance ministry, is to blame for its misadventures in the property market in the 1980s, because the state was in charge of nominating top management and keeping tabs on the group's financial situation.</p>
