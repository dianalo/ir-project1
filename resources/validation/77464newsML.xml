<text>
<p>Swedish shares rose across the market in heavy volumes on Thursday, led by a 14 percent rise in Hennes &amp; Mauritz and respectable performances from blue chips Astra and Ericsson.</p>
<p>The all-share index rose 0.57 percent to 2,056.97 in turnover of 4.25 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Hennes &amp; Mauritz was the day's star performer, gaining 92 crowns to 769 after posting better than expected results for the first nine months of the company's split financial year.</p>
<p>The company reported a pre-tax profit of 1.02 billion crowns, compared with market consensus forecasts of 853 million.</p>
<p>The tone of the market was strong, and all sector indices closed higher with the exception of forestry. The day's top performing index was of course retail, largely due to Hennes &amp; Mauritz heavy weighting in the sector.</p>
<p>The retail index increased 9.6 percent up on the day.</p>
<p>Ericsson and Astra contributed to the day's high turnover. Shares in the two plus Hennes &amp; Mauritz contributed 1.5 billion crowns of turnover to the total of 4.25 billion.</p>
<p>Ericsson closed 4.5 crowns higher at 170.5, and Astra gained 2.5 crowns to 277.</p>
<p>Swedish Match provided the day's big anti-climax. The company called a news conference which aroused interest in the share, only to dash market hopes by announcing a yacht sponsorship deal.</p>
<p>Swedish Match shares slipped 0.20 crowns to close at 20.</p>
