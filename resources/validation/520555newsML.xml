<p>A majority of Israelis believe Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must resign if charged or convicted in a corruption scandal, newspaper opinion polls showed on Friday.</p>
<p>The 47-year-old leader, elected 11 months ago by less than a percentage point, on Thursday rejected calls he resign while prosecutors weighed police recommendations he be indicted in an influence-peddling scheme.</p>
<p>A Gallup poll of 487 Jews for the daily Maariv showed 52.6 percent believed he must quit and call elections if indicted. A Dahaf Institute poll of 503 adults in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth showed 52 percent wanted him to resign if convicted.</p>
<p>The results were typically close, pollster Hanoch Smith told Reuters. &quot;Israeli society remains very evenly divided as it is on almost all basic political issues.&quot;</p>
<p>Police this week recommended Netanyahu be indicted for fraud and breach of trust in the short-lived appointment of an attorney general.</p>
<p>The affair has overshadowed a two-day mission by U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross aimed at reviving Israel-PLO peace talks.</p>
<p>Ross left the region on Friday with Palestinians declaring the month-old crisis in peace moves sparked by Israeli settlement construction in Arab East Jerusalem had not abated.</p>
<p>&quot;We still have a major crisis,&quot; said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way to restore confidence and credibility to the peace process requires Mr Netanyahu to stop the work on Jabal Abu Ghneim,&quot; he told Reuters, referring to a hill in East Jerusalem where Israeli bulldozers were carving out a new Jewish settlement.</p>
<p>Far from resigning, Netanyahu gave himself another job at a cabinet meeting on Friday, taking the science minister's post Binyamin Begin quit in protest at Israeli peace moves in January. By law, no cabinet post must remain vacant for more than three months.</p>
<p>&quot;We are staying where the people and history have put us,&quot; Netanyahu told cheering supporters at his Likud party's headquarters in Tel Aviv on Thursday.</p>
<p>Prosecutors pored over the 995-page police report for a fourth straight day, keeping Netanyahu's political life in limbo as they considered whether he would become the first Israeli prime minister to face criminal charges.</p>
<p>&quot;We are finishing our work. We are trying to do our best to try to finish this Sunday hopefully and then everyone will know our decision,&quot; State Attorney Edna Arbel told reporters.</p>
<p>The Gallup poll, with a 4.3 percent margin of error, asked what Netanyahu should do if charged: 52.6 percent said he must quit and call elections and 39.3 percent that he must go about business as usual until judges decide the case.</p>
<p>The remaining 8.1 percent did not know or did not respond.</p>
<p>In the Dahaf poll, with a four percent margin of error, 52 percent believed Netanyahu should resign only if convicted, 25 percent said now, and 20 percent if and when an indictment is brought against him. Three percent had no response.</p>
<p>Prosecutors could still ignore the police recommendation Netanyahu be charged over the appointment of Likud activist Roni Bar-On as attorney general three months ago.</p>
<p>Israel's Channel One television got the police probe going by alleging in a report in January that a Netanyahu ally on trial for corruption, politician Aryeh Deri, pushed Bar-On for the job in hopes of winning a plea bargain.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who has called the allegations &quot;nonsense&quot;, is under no legal obligation to quit if indicted, although jurists expect he would step down to conform with what one called &quot;public norms,&quot; forcing a new election.</p>
<p>High Court judges have ruled in the past that ministers under indictment must step down.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's ruling coalition of mainly right-wing and religious parties could crumble in any event.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if no one is charged, should it become clear that very serious things were done from a public and democratic standpoint, we'll not be able to go on backing such a government and will want early elections,&quot; Yehuda Harel, of the four-member Third Way in Netanyahu's coalition, told army radio.</p>
