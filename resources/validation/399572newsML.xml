<title>FRANCE: Berlin-winner Forman drops Larry Flynt poster.</title>

<p>U.S. director Milos Forman said on Monday he had decided to withdraw posters advertising his film &quot;The People vs Larry Flynt&quot; in France after complaints that they offended Christians.</p>
<p>Forman made his announcement on the day the Hollywood film about the American pornography publishing king won the &quot;Golden Bear&quot; prize for best film at the Berlin film festival.</p>
<p>French judges last week refused to ban the posters after pleas by a group of Roman Catholics and a right-wing association that the advertisements, showing a semi-nude actor in a crucifix-like pose, were an infringement on religious freedom.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither Columbia Pictures nor I intended that our poster for 'The People vs Larry Flynt' provoke or offend anyone,&quot; Forman said in a statement issued by Columbia.</p>
<p>&quot;Its design was meant to reflect the satirical treatment of the themes of the film: fake patriotism, hypocritical piety, the use of nudity as a commodity, and to display the freedom we enjoy in the United States to examine such subjects,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The posters show actor Woody Harrelson, arms outstretched, wearing only briefs made of the Stars and Stripes flag, against a backdrop of a woman's bikini-clad loins.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the incomprehension prompted by the poster, the attacks and the threats against distributors and the harnessing (of the issue) by various politico-religious associations, I have asked Columbia Pictures in a pacifying gesture...to withdraw this poster, which it has accepted,&quot; Forman said.</p>
<p>Protestors have in the past few days thrown black ink at the poster at several cinemas in Paris.</p>
<p>The film, which won two nominations for Oscars this month, opened in France last Wednesday amid a blaze of publicity, largely generated by the posters.</p>
<p>A Paris appeals court is due to cn Wednesday to consider a new demand by about 30 Roman Catholics and an group close to the far-right National Front for a formal ban. Protestants, the rector of the Paris mosque, and more Catholic groups have joined the appeal.</p>
<p>A public prosecutor had urged the courts last Tuesday to ban the posters on grounds they caused an illegal affront. Lawyers for Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp, argued they were protected by freedom of expression.</p>
<p>The town of Versailles west of Paris asked the company to take down the posters last week after the mayor said he received a string of complaints. Bishops also criticised the poster in a country where most people are nominally Catholic.</p>
<p>The film depicts the tumultuous life of publisher Flynt, a school drop-out who ran strip clubs in Ohio before launching his successful magazine Hustler in 1973.</p>
<p>The poster was rejected by the Motion Picture Association of America. In Australia, it was branded degrading and offensive to women and Christians by the Womens' Electoral Lobby and the Catholic Church.</p>
