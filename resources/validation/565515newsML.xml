<headline>Brent crude paper up, wet barrels steady.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>North Sea Brent gained on a very quiet paper market on Wednesday with intermonth spreads and contracts for difference both firming sharply, traders said.</p>
<p>June was 14 cents higher at $18.21 a barrel, seven cents off the day's high of $18.28, supported by bullish U.S. weekly inventory data.</p>
<p>On the Brent physical market one deal was reported -- a Wall Street trader sold a May 17-19 cargo to a European trader at a Dated Brent related price.</p>
<p>Earlier, Brent was thinly talked five cents weaker than Tuesday's trade level of June Brent -28 cents.</p>
<p>U.S. gasoline led the market after the DOE said that stocks suffered a draw of 2.4 million barrels in the May 2 week.</p>
<p>Brent intermonth spreads firmed, with a June/July traded at least once at -11 cents, or four cents higher than its best trade level on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The May/June spread firmed sharply, talked at -8/-5 cents from -20/-15 while Jul/Aug gained some three cents, bid at -12 cents.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs also tightened with a May 19-23 trading at least once at July Brent -30 cents, or the equivalent of June Brent -19 cents.</p>
<p>Next week's CFDs were talked some 16 cents sharper at June Brent -24 cents.</p>
<p>Traders said other North Sea crudes were steady or slightly higher.</p>
<p>A Norwegian major sold a May 18-20 cargo of Oseberg at Dated Brent +15 cents to a French refiner, one cent higher than a deal on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Forties was done twice at Dated Brent +22 on Tuesday &quot;so I guess it will be a that level again&quot;, one European producer said. Norwegian Statfjord was around a 20 cent premium to Dated Brent, he added.  </p>
<p>According to the May schedule no full Brent cargoes were going around the chains on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean Urals market was quiet but stable to firmer with one seller seeing a bid at Dated Brent -95 cents for an already committed last decade May cargo.</p>
<p>An offer of Dated Brent -$1.00 was heard for a cargo loading on Thursday May 8.</p>
<p>Traders looking at Iraqi crude saw one end May Kirkuk cargo for sale but said there was a possibility this would be cancelled were the price of crude to rise over the next two weeks, thus bringing the income from crude to above the U.N. agreed limit.</p>
<p>The United Nations oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to sell up to $2 billion worth of oil in a 180 day period (up to June 7) to raise money for humanitarian imports.</p>
<p>&quot;It depends on where the price (for crude oil) goes over the next two weeks ...but it is perfectly possible a cargo would be cancelled,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Talk that an end May cargo had been reduced in size from a one million barrel lifting to 600,000 barrels could not be confirmed immmediately.</p>
<p>West African markets were quiet and traders expected more barrels to trade to the East in the coming few days.</p>
