<p>NWE gasoline edged higher in line with stronger IPE futures at midday on Monday in a typically lacklustre start to the week, traders said.</p>
<p>Eurograde barges for May delivery were talked around $193/$195 per tonne fob ARA. A first-half May barge was reported done at $194 fob ARA.</p>
<p>Prompt material was cheaper with one player offering it as low as $189, although traders said other sellers were looking for higher levels.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not too much going on,&quot; said one trader. &quot;People are quite relaxed unless they've got April barrels they want to get rid of.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said the gasoline market's progress over the next week depended to a great extent on U.S. demand.</p>
<p>Last week's American Petroleum Institute (API) data showed unexpected builds in gasoline stocks at time.</p>
<p>U.S. gasoline demand usually increases in the spring and summer months as Americans take to the roads, but continuing cold weather in parts of the country, early refinery maintenance and falling crude prices have so far put a dampener on the season.</p>
