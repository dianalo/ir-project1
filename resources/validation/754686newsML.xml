<p>Algerian troops have trapped and may have killed Antar Zouabri, chief of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) which Algiers blames for massacring hundreds of people, Algerian newspapers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>One influential newspaper, the Arabic-language Al Khabar, also reported &quot;some sources&quot; as saying a mass grave with about 100 bodies had been found. It was discovered by troops advancing across rough terrain in an operation against the GIA rebels on the heights of Attatba in Algeria's western Tipaza province.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not known so far if these are the bodies of civilians or terrorists killed in the first days of the operation in the region where heads of the GIA were expected to meet,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The report follows one two days ago in El Watan newspaper, usually well-informed on security issues, which said that in the military operation against rebels many corpses had been found.</p>
<p>&quot;In their advance, the bulldozers unearthed by accident dozens of corpses. The authorities are still unable to say whether they are civilians kidnapped by armed gangs, or terrorists,&quot; El Watan said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Al Khabar said there were conflicting reports as to whether the GIA chief remained trapped or was among scores of guerrillas killed in the operation.</p>
<p>Liberte newspaper said Zouabri, aged 27 and with a price of 450,000 dinars ($8,035) on his head, was trapped.</p>
<p>It quoted statements from several &quot;terrorists&quot; who &quot;escaped Zouabri's vigilance and surrendered&quot; as saying the GIA chief, alias Abou Talha, had threatened anyone against giving up.</p>
<p>&quot;Moreover, the bloody terrorist chief had not hesitated to kill 12 of his close aides who were preparing to surrender,&quot; Liberte quoted the GIA members as saying.</p>
<p>Newspapers gave varying accounts as to how the military came across the GIA group.</p>
<p>Liberte said it started with the killing of a man in front of a close relative who apparently told the security forces where the group had its base. This was then put under surveillance.</p>
<p>El Watan earlier said the offensive began when a woman, who had been kidnapped by rebels, escaped and tipped off government forces as to their whereabouts. This coincided with leaders of several gangs going to the hideout for a congress to plot strategy and then being trapped by security forces.</p>
<p>There has been no direct confirmation of the operation against the &quot;terrorists&quot; -- Algeria's term for Moslem fundamentalists. But the fact the newspapers have reported it, without sanction, in a country where the press is tightly controlled on security issues, is seen as tacit confirmation.</p>
<p>This has been further supported by Algeria's official news agency APS mentioning the reports in its &quot;review of the press&quot;.</p>
<p>The newspapers give varying figures for the death toll among the guerrillas, and none mention casualties on the side of the government forces.</p>
<p>Liberte said on Thursday that 64 &quot;terrorists&quot; had been killed and 32 surrendered with their weapons in less than a week.</p>
<p>Two days ago, El Watan said a total of 140 guerrillas had been killed out of 180 who were trapped, while Liberte said it was still not known how many were there.</p>
<p>&quot;But in view of the means deployed by the combined forces in this region and the intensity of automatic weapons fire it is certainly one of the most important GIA groups,&quot; Liberte said.</p>
