<p>The chief economist of Germany's central bank warned on Monday that entry criteria for Europe's planned currency union must not be altered, speaking out in a smouldering debate on the issue among European leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;As we have said on many occasions, a softening of the convergence criteria is out of the question in our opinion,&quot; the Bundesbank's Otmar Issing told a group of bankers.</p>
<p>Italian officials have this month stirred a long simmering debate on European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) criteria by suggesting they should be renegotiated in light of Europe's sluggish economic growth and fiscal problems.</p>
<p>Nations wishing to join the single currency at its planned starting date on January 1, 1999 must show their budget deficits are not exceeding three percent of gross domestic product while their total public debt does not exceed 60 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>Issing rejected the calls for more lenient entry criteria, suggesting instead that nations must go one step further and adopt another document to ensure lasting stability once the union is founded.</p>
<p>Issing said it was also important to adopt a so-called stability pact, currently being discussed by European leaders, which would impose automatic sanctions on members straying from the original targets.</p>
<p>Commenting on speculation that countries may be let into EMU even if they exceed the prescribed targets, Issing said the stability pact could not be seen as a replacement for the original entry criteria.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot get around implementing a stability pact but not as a replacement for the convergence criteria. The stability criteria must be observed,&quot; Issing said.</p>
<p>A stability pact's sanctions were particularly important because the Maastricht Treaty, setting out the rules for the currency union, held no provisions to expel a nation for bad behaviour, Issing said.</p>
<p>&quot;Expulsion is not a planned option,&quot; Issing said, adding, &quot;The economic cost of quitting EMU, disregarding the political ramifications, would be immense.&quot;</p>
<p>He warned that Germany was currently in danger of missing both the debt and deficit criteria this year.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a danger that Germany will again clearly miss the three percent deficit criteria this year and recently it has also exceeded the 60 percent debt target,&quot; Issing said.  REUTER</p>
