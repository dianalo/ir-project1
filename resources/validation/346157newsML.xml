<p>Contrasting half-centuries from Dave Houghton and Grant Flower lifted Zimbabwe from a shaky start to a respectable 256 for eight in the triangular series day-night match against South Africa on Friday.</p>
<p>Flower anchored the 50-over innings with a composed 62 from 93 balls and Houghton provided the acceleration with a brilliant 57 off 61 balls, with four fours and a six.</p>
<p>The pair added a vital 93 runs for the fifth wicket to help the touring side recover from 61 for four in the 16th over.</p>
<p>When Houghton was caught off a leading edge and Flower was bowled by a good delivery from Hansie Cronje, the lower middle order kept the momentum going.</p>
<p>Guy Whittall (41 off 45 balls) and Paul Strang (40 off 38) put on 63 in 10 overs for the seventh wicket before Whittall became one of four victims for Allan Donald.</p>
<p>Fast bowler Donald gave South Africa a dream start by dismissing Andy Waller (1) and Andy Flower (0) in the space of three balls in the third over to reduce Zimbabwe to six for two.</p>
<p>Craig Wishart contributed 24 to a third wicket stand of 45 before being caught behind off Shaun Pollock and Zimbabwe captain Alistair Campbell was unluckily run out for five when he slipped in trying to regain his ground at the non-striker's end and was beaten by a direct hit from Andrew Hudson.</p>
