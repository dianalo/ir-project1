<p>Malaysia's base metals market is expected to enjoy robust growth over the next 10 years on the back of a booming economy which has driven consumption in infrastructual development, industry analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>Economic growth of more than eight percent for nearly a decade has spawned huge construction and electronics and telecommunication projects heavily dependent on steel and base metals such as aluminium and copper.</p>
<p>&quot;As Malaysia is committed to join the league of industrialised nations, it is expected that the iron and steel industry...will continue to play a strong part in the country's overall economic development,&quot; SMPC Metal Bhd, a local iron and steel foundry, said in a company report.</p>
<p>The report, quoting statistics from the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research, said domestic demand for iron and steel was forecast at 9.30 million tonnes in 2000, against the 6.98 million tonnes used in 1995.</p>
<p>By 2005, local consumption was expected to reach 15 million tonnes, with demand basically for &quot;long products&quot; such as steel bars, rods and wires, and &quot;flat products&quot; such as steel sheets, strips and plates, the report said.</p>
<p>The Malaysian Iron and Steel Industry Foundation said in a study last year the industry faced a lack of quality human resources, rising costs of infrastructure, cyclical demand and supply, high import tariffs and a lack of linkages and support.</p>
<p>Analysts said the historical high of steel consumption in the United States was 800 kg per capita and that Malaysia would enter the league of developed countries if its consumption rose to 777 kg per capita from an estimated 350 kg now.</p>
<p>Malaysian companies attracted by the bullish economic fundamentals, such as SMPC, Sumiputeh Steel Centre Sdn Bhd, Nicomsteel (M) Sdn Bhd and Choo Bee Metal Industries Bhd have invested substantially in steel, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Malaysia's construction industry is projected to grow 20 to 25 percent in the next three years...that itself makes steel a very viable subsector,&quot; said an analyst with a foreign securities research house in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>The nation is racing to complete in part or full huge building and infrastructure jobs -- such as the Bakun hydroelectric dam, Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the Kuala Lumpur City Centre project and the inner-city Light Rail Transit system -- before the turn of the century.</p>
<p>An ambitious Malaysia Electronics City, which aims to produce anything from rice cookers to television sets, is also under construction. This project poses good potential for soldering metals produced by the aluminium industry.</p>
<p>Analysts said aluminium producers were also expected to see strong demand for a wide range of packaging from the manufacturing sector, which makes up nearly 35 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product.</p>
<p>Demand for copper is expected to be bullish as well, with analysts estimating that at least 100,000 tonnes will be needed over the next five years to meet cabling needs for telecommunication and infrastructure projects.</p>
