<p>A sharp increase in crude petroleum prices drove producer inflation above the eight percent mark in October, economists said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Statistics released by the Central Statistical Services (CSS) on Thursday show the producer price index (PPI) rose 8.3 percent year-on-year -- higher than a Reuters consensus forecast of a 7.9 percent rise -- and 1.3 percent month-on-month.</p>
<p>The imported component, which makes up about 20 percent of overall PPI, grew 3.0 percent from September -- the highest since June 1995.</p>
<p>CSS said within the imported component, crude petroleum prices rose 23.2 percent on month, which boosted the mining and quarrying products category by 19.8 percent.</p>
<p>But Transnet economist Mike Schussler said the increase in petroleum prices did not correlate with fuel price increases between September and October and led him to believe that latest data had been adjusted to reflect previous miscalculations.</p>
<p>Economists have questioned the CSS's calculation of crude price increases and its component in the PPI, claiming they have not correlated in recent months.</p>
<p>Standard Bank Economics Division said that although rand oil prices had been rising sharply for some months, this had not been reflected in the PPI until now.</p>
<p>&quot;We had warned that a catch-up was bound to occur, and indeed it happened with a vengeance,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Schussler said that between September and October the rand crude oil price rose to 105.52 a barrel from 101.33 -- a four percent increase.</p>
<p>&quot;The monthly increase in the crude component of PPI correlates more with fuel price increases from August,&quot; Schussler said.</p>
<p>Crude oil was priced at 87.74 rand in August, which would result in a 20.3 percent increase to October. In July it was priced at 84 rand, which would result in a 25.6 percent rise, Schussler said.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say there has definitely been an adjustment,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>CSS head Mark Orkin, who has maintained the statistics are accurate, was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The local component of PPI rose 0.8 percent month-on-month, which economists said was mainly a result of food price increases.</p>
<p>Standard Bank said it still expected PPI to average about seven percent for 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Producer inflation rates are expected to continue rising until peaking in March/April 1997, at which point the PPI should briefly enter double digits,&quot; it said, adding that it expected producer inflation to average nine percent next year.</p>
<p>A Reuters quarterly poll of economists in November forecast producer inflation would average at 9.14 percent next year.</p>
