<title>AUSTRALIA: Two shot dead in botched Australian robbery.</title>

<p>Two men were shot dead and a woman critically injured in a botched robbery at a wholesale gem dealers office in the centre of Melbourne on Wednesday, Australian police said.</p>
<p>Witnesses said up to 15 shots were fired soon after midday (0100 GMT) at the eighth floor offices of Pin Gems.</p>
<p>Paramedic Roger Williams said the injured woman, who appeared to be in her mid-to-late thirties, was shot three times in the head, twice in the chest and twice in the legs.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very, very critical head injury,&quot; Williams said.</p>
<p>Police said the dead men were Asian, one middle-aged and one in his twenties.</p>
<p>Williams said all the victims had been shot at close range. The two men were found dead near an open safe, while the woman was slumped in the doorway, he said.</p>
<p>A fourth man, believed to have been a customer, was uninjured and was being interviewed by police.</p>
<p>Police halted traffic and cordoned off the building, which houses a number of jewellers and jewellery suppliers, but no trace of the gunman was found.</p>
<p>&quot;Those responsible for this likely walked out the front door and mingled with shoppers,&quot; said a police officer.</p>
<p>The shooting reawakened memories of April's Port Arthur massacre in Australia's southern island state of Tasmania when 35 people were shot dead by lone gunman Martin Bryant.</p>
<p>Bryant, 29, was last month sentenced to life in prison.</p>
<p>The Port Arthur massacre sparked a national ban on almost all self-loading rifles. About 170,000 self-loading rifles have so far been handed in at a cost of A$75 million (US$59 million) in a government-buy back scheme initiated after the massacre.</p>
