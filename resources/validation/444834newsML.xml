<p>The Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) has a critical role in deciding the fate of a planned global alliance between the world's biggest oil exchanges, industry sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) of London confirmed on Thursday they were looking at ways to quote their crude contracts jointly on a 24-hour electronic trading system.</p>
<p>But SIMEX could thwart IPE's ambitions.</p>
<p>To quote the crude contracts jointly, it would need the go-ahead from SIMEX, the sources said.</p>
<p>IPE quotes only Brent, a world benchmark crude from the North Sea. In 1995, it agreed to quote Brent also on SIMEX.</p>
<p>But that pact included a provision that the two exchanges would both have to agree to Brent being quoted on MYMEX.</p>
<p>&quot;SIMEX is in a very strong position to influence these talks,&quot; said a senior broker. &quot;Screen trading is the way these markets are going.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1995, the IPE agreed to allow its Brent contract to be listed on SIMEX open-outcry market for five years. Positions could be opened in London and closed on SIMEX, or vica versa.</p>
<p>But traded volumes in Singapore have been poor, so news of the NYMEX/IPE talks earlier this week sparked worries SIMEX was being sidelined. However, the provision in the SIMEX/IPE agreement makes that impossible, the sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;What ever they want to do there should be consultation with SIMEX,&quot; said one source, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the day, the three exchanges will put their heads together and come out with a plan which will address some of the inefficiencies and cost arrangements of trying to trade globally,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>Richard Ward, head of product development at the IPE, told a news conference on Thursday that NYMEX and the IPE hoped to reach an official agreement in the third quarter on how to link trading.</p>
<p>At the same time, he said the IPE had no intention of dropping its Asian partner.</p>
<p>&quot;We want the SIMEX agreement to succeed...Clearly we need to have the agreement of all interested parties to be able to progress this -- we do not want to end up with an adversarial relationship with any exchange.&quot;</p>
<p>But some sources said SIMEX was only made aware of the NYMEX/IPE talks at a late stage, despite the mutual agreement concerning Brent.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Sam, the deputy chairman of SIMEX, told Reuters on Thursday by telephone from a futures industry conference in the United States, that SIMEX had been asked to take part in the discussions. But she declined to say when SIMEX became involved.</p>
<p>Some sources said an alliance of the exchanges was inevitable, given the economic shift to global alliances in industry in general, and should help counter the slide in traded volumes of oil futures in recent years.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes sense to have three exchanges working together to build up volume,&quot; one source said.</p>
