<p>The pricing of PCIBank's US$100 million Eurobond was the final event in Asian debt markets Thursday in a day that offered a bit of many things.</p>
<p>The 7.75 percent five-year bond for Philippine Commercial International Bank was priced at 99.902 to yield 120 basis points over comparable U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>Fees are 50 basis points.</p>
<p>Pricing was on the tighter end of the indicated 120 to 130 basis points range.</p>
<p>The 120 basis point spread works out to about 95 basis point over the London Interbank Offered Rate. That compares with the 85 basis points paid by Metrobank on its recent five-year floating rate certificate of deposit issue, which marked the first five-year borrowing for a Philippines bank.</p>
<p>Lead manager Merrill Lynch said the deal, which utilized the first global MTN programme established in the Philippines, was significant on several counts.</p>
<p>&quot;We were able to find crossover European investors and select U.S. investors who were buying Philippine paper for first time, as well as the more traditional Asian investors who bought on an asset-swapped basis,&quot; said Tom Seaman, managing director at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Seaman also noted that a number of Asian investors kept the bank's paper as a fixed rate, &quot;which further exemplifies the growth and maturation of the Asian markets as a whole.&quot;</p>
<p>More and more Asian issues are being launched in Europe, but some Hong Kong bankers have questioned how much of that paper actually stays in Europe and how much is swapped back into Asia.</p>
<p>The next Philippine Eurobond in the pipeline is for conglomerate JG Summit Holdings, which is seen launching a 5.5 year US$200 million bond. ING Barings is tipped as the lead.</p>
<p>Among other Asian issues, Peregrine Fixed Income has brought a US$100 million floating rate note issue for a unit of Indonesia's Bakrie and Brothers.</p>
<p>Like Peregrine's FRNs for Dharmala Inti Utama and APP International Finance, the Bakrie deal comes with an indicated spread and will be priced after replies are received. Responses are due in mid-October.</p>
<p>Central Banking Corp, one of South Korea's newest merchant banks, has launched a U$50 million FRCD via Sumitomo Finance Asia and ING Barings.</p>
<p>The 364-day paper pays a margin of 45 basis points over LIBOR and an all-in return of 53 basis points.</p>
<p>Boram Bank has mandated Standard Chartered Investment Banking and Sanwa International Finance to arrange a US$100 million FRN. The issue has a final maturity of three years but can be put annually.</p>
<p>Pricing for the Boram deal has not been set but bankers said they expect it will pay an all-in of about 35 basis points.</p>
<p>Looking overseas, PTTEP International's 10-year US$200 million 144a bond reportedly has priced at 85 basis points over comparable Treasuries. The company is a unit of Thailand's state oil company.</p>
<p>Malaysia's state pretroleum company Petronas today said it expects its upcoming global bond to launch in late September or early October. The size and tenor have not been set.</p>
