<title>MEXICO: Salinas y Rocha up on sale rumors.</title>
<headline>Salinas y Rocha up on sale rumors.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-04-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of Mexican retail company Grupo Salinas y Rocha were sharply higher on the Bolsa in late trade Thursday on rumors the debt-strapped firm plans to sell some of its units, traders said.</p>
<p>Salinas y Rocha's benchmark L shares were up 21.21 percent to 80 centavos on the Mexican Stock Exchange, although traders noted volume was thin.</p>
<p>The company's shares have led the percentage gainers on the bourse for the past four sessions in a row.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a rumor the company will sell assets shortly and that would reduce its debt significantly,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>&quot;For about two years, the company has had plans to sell some of its assets and now would be a good time to do it because of the favorable expectations in the retail sector this year,&quot; said Christine Aimar, a retail analyst at Deutche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Analysts said the company might sell its department stores division and some real estate holdings, but keep its home furnishings unit known as Optima.</p>
<p>Company officials at Salinas y Rocha would not comment on the rumors.</p>
<p>&quot;The company's silence on the matter makes me think whatever deal they are working on will be concluded soon,&quot; said another Mexico City analyst. Dealers and analysts did not know who the potential buyer might be.</p>
<p>Salinas y Rocha was hard hit by the 1994 peso crash. The company unveiled a plan to restructure some $450 million in debt. The company specializes in home furnishings and has 137 outlets in 65 cities.</p>
