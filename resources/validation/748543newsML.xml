<p>Britain's largest building society the Nationwide on Wednesday won a resounding victory in its battle to retain mutually-owned status, beating off a group of would-be rebel directors favouring conversion to a bank.</p>
<p>Nationwide's five directors were re-elected to the board, defeating the conversion lobby led by self-proclaimed &quot;freelance butler&quot; Michael Hardern.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a clear turning point in the debate about the value that members see in societies that wish to remain mutual,&quot; Nationwide's chief executive Brian Davis told a press briefing.</p>
<p>Davis said the vote, which gave the Nationwide's directors an average of 70 percent of all the votes cast, was also a victory for the society's role in providing competition against the banks.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly the butler didn't do it, and the Nationwide membership have given a ringing endorsement to its mutual stance,&quot; Mike Jackson, chief executive of Birmingham Midshires, Britain's sixth largest building society said in a statement.</p>
<p>A total of 1.35 million of Nationwide's overall membership of around 3.5 million members voted.</p>
<p>The ballot was a test for the future of Britain's more than 200-year-old building society movement. In recent months the Halifax, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Woolwich have all ditched their mutuality in favour of life as publicly-listed banks quoted on the stock exchange.</p>
<p>This process has resulted in free share hand-outs totalling billions of pounds to millions of members of the former societies. It has also fuelled a frenzy of so-called &quot;carpet-bagging&quot;, where individuals open savings accounts in the hope they will benefit from any future share out if a society converted.</p>
<p>Hardern and the four other pro-conversion candidates had campaigned on a ticket which promised members a minimum hand-out of a thousand pounds ($1,680). City analysts had valued the Nationwide at over seven billion pounds if it had chosen to float.</p>
<p>Building societies have traditionally been the main lenders to homeowners and are owned by their members, the savers and borrowers.</p>
<p>Nationwide's victory was welcomed by other building societies who have held out against a recent move to stock market flotation by larger societies, and also by Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p>
<p>&quot;I was delighted to see the result. I think the right decision was made,&quot; Blair told Parliament.</p>
<p>Britannia, the third largest mutual, said it welcomed the Nationwide members' rejection of the &quot;Members for Conversion&quot; candidates, adding it was deeply concerned about the disruption they caused.</p>
<p>&quot;(They) have caused severe disruption to Nationwide and to other building societies and it would be no surprise if steps were taken to ensure that this cannot happen again,&quot; John Heaps, Britannia's chief executive said in a statement.</p>
<p>Charles Nunneley, Nationwide's chairman, said he was delighted by the outcome of the ballot, but admitted some surprise at the result in the light of the huge publicity and speculation about windfalls.</p>
<p>Davis said Nationwide had taken a record amount in new deposits totalling 1.35 billion pounds during June and it was now dealing with the backlog. He admitted the campaign had been highly disruptive to both the society and its customers.</p>
<p>&quot;We trust that those who have been seeking to push us into conversion will now accept the result.&quot;</p>
<p>Nationwide's Nunneley would not comment specifically on whether the society had been approached by banks about possible mergers or takeovers, saying such talks were part of everyday business for a financial institution.</p>
<p>But Davis said Nationwide did not need to do anything to increase its size, and was not seeking to merge with any of the other building societies. He said growth would be organic.</p>
<p>Nunneley told Reuters there was no immediate prospect of Nationwide branching out into overseas ventures, despite the society's recently adopted slogan &quot;the world's number one building society&quot;. ($ = 0.594 British Pounds)</p>
