<p>Scientists in Montserrat were  on high alert on Friday after the Caribbean island's volcano spewed  clouds of ash, rocks and gas and instruments indicated another eruption  might come soon.</p>
<p>&quot;We had an increase in volcanic activity, an increase in ashing, which  the scientists thought might have led to another eruption,&quot; government  information officer Herman Sargeant said, as scientists reported an  upsurge in rockfalls and earthquakes within the volcano on Thursday  and overnight into Friday morning.</p>
<p>Residents, already forced out of the southern half of the island by  the volcano's threat, were under orders to go outside only while wearing  dust masks.</p>
<p>&quot;The scientists are watching the situation very closely to see how  it develops over the next few days,&quot; Sargeant said.</p>
<p>A major eruption would be the first since Montserrat's volcano spewed  super-heated rocks and gas on June 25, leaving some 20 people dead  and several villages burned to the ground.</p>
<p>Since then, about 1,000 people have left Montserrat for safer shores,  Sargeant said. He said it was difficult to guess the island's current  population, although island leaders said it had dropped to only 5,000  to 6,000 in June, compared with 11,000 in July 1995 when the volcano  roared to life.</p>
<p>The southern half of Montserrat, including its capital, Plymouth,  has been under an evacuation order for most of the past two years,  forcing many islanders to abandon farms and other businesses and to  live in shelters or stay with friends and relatives.</p>
