<p>South Korean President Kim Young-sam on Tuesday urged the Finance and Economy Minister to prepare legislation implementing financial reforms proposed by a presidential reform panel.</p>
<p>The Presidential Commission for Financial Reform was due to present today proposals to Kim to modernise the nation's backward financial industry.  </p>
<p>&quot;I hope the Finance Minister would prepare the government's reform bills based on the proposals and discuss them with political parties,&quot; Kim said in a meeting with members of the commission, the finance minister and heads of the central bank and financial supervisory boards.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like the Finance Minister to submit legislation to this coming parliamentary session for adoption,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kim said the proposals contained long-pending but difficult issues including the central bank's independence, revision of the financial supervisory board system and changes in ownership of financial institutions.  </p>
<p>&quot;I believe the commission proposals are substantial and are on the right track,&quot; Kim said.</p>
<p>Kim said the financial industry faced a global tide of integration, increased autonomy and efficiency.</p>
<p>&quot;First of all, the central bank should be independent and its status should be enhanced so that it can implement monetary policy neutrally,&quot; he said. But the bank must be fully aware of its duties, including its role in curbing inflation, he said..</p>
<p>The 31-member presidential panel was to propose a single unified financial supervisory board to oversee the banking, securities and insurance industries.  </p>
<p>&quot;Given the global trend towards lowering barriers within the financial industry, the commission's proposal for a unified financial watchdog agency is heading in the right direction,&quot; Kim said.</p>
<p>Each government agency involved in macro-economic management, monetary policy and supervision should work independently but cooperatively, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Eventually, these reforms should clarify and increase the efficiency of the roles, links and responsibilities of financial authorities such as the Finance Ministry, the central bank and supervisory boards,&quot; he said.</p>
