<p>Pressure is building for European Union governments to conclude the inter-governmental conference by mid-year, David Davis, British Foreign Office minister for European affairs, told politicians on Thursday.</p>
<p>He told the European Legislation Select Committee that the Dutch, who hold the EU presidency, were anxious to conclude the IGC successfully and were not alone in that regard.</p>
<p>The IGC is due to be completed at an Amsterdam summit in mid-June with an updated treaty signed and sealed.</p>
<p>Davis said France and Germany, who face elections next year, as does the Netherlands, were just as keen to produce a new treaty as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;The EU will loom large as an issue in those elections,&quot; Davis said. &quot;Many of them want to get these negotiations out of the way beforehand, with a conclusion reached in Amsterdam.&quot;</p>
<p>Davis said British elections, due by May, were clearly also an issue for the IGC. He said some policies such as the Social Chapter, which guarantees minimum employment rights, would be addressed differently by a Labour government rather than a Conservative one.</p>
<p>&quot;That is being viewed as a post-election issue,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Labour Party has pledged to sign up to the Social Chapter if it comes to power. The Conservatives have a veto over the legislation. Labour currently enjoys a lead of up to 20 points in opinion polls.</p>
<p>Davis said there were those in the EU who hoped a British election could prompt a change of view over qualified majority voting on EU proposals. Britain insists on keeping a veto.</p>
<p>&quot;There are those who would hang on in the faint hope that they will get a government willing to give up its veto in certain areas,&quot; he said. &quot;But it is a faint hope.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the government had no problem debating and contributing to EU proposals across a wide spectrum. &quot;But ratification by all countries is a good, democratic check. We should not be giving up constitutional rights,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Select Committee, comprising both eurosceptic and europhile members of parliament, released a report earlier this week stating that national parliaments had a crucial role to play in the EU far into the future.</p>
<p>&quot;National parliaments will have to approve the treaty. The heads of state and government will be well advised to ensure that the document which they sign in Amsterdam takes full account of the rights and expectations of parliaments,&quot; it said.</p>
