<title>BURMA: Small Burmese student group plans campus rally.</title>
<headline>Small Burmese student group plans campus rally.</headline>
<dateline>RANGOON 1996-12-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>About 50 Burmese students, released by police after being held for protesting in the capital, planned to rally at the Yangon Institute of Technology (YIT) later on Wednesday, campus sources said.</p>
<p>However, the students were persuaded by YIT lecturers to return to their classes and it was unknown if the rally would be staged as planned, the sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>The group was part of about 300 students who had been detained by police after demonstrating in the heart of Rangoon before sunrise on Tuesday, they said.</p>
<p>Witnesses at the scene said the 300 who had refused to disperse had been herded into police trucks and driven off.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) said on Tuesday most of those held had been released after their identities had been checked. However, he did not give the numbers of those detained or released.</p>
<p>The students had been demonstrating since late on Monday against police action after a brawl in October between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners.</p>
<p>The demonstration, which drew nearly 2,000 students at its peak on Monday, was the biggest street protest seen in Rangoon since the September 1988 pro-democracy uprisings.</p>
<p>State-run newspapers said in commentaries on Wednesday that students should focus on their studies instead of associating themselves with dissident politicians.</p>
<p>Although they did not name the politicians, they were apparently referring to members of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) which is involved in a standoff with the SLORC.</p>
<p>A Suu Kyi aide said her movements had been restricted by the SLORC and she could not leave her home for the time being. The restrictions followed the student demonstrations.</p>
<p>Human rights group Amnesty International said five members of the NLD's youth wing had been detained by the military for interrogation after they left Suu Kyi's residence on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It added that Suu Kyi's compound had been sealed by the Burmese authorities and no one could enter or leave it.</p>
