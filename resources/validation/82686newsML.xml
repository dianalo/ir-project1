<text>
<p>The following is a brief chronology of the period of short-lived governments and chronic political instability in Japanese politics since 1987. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Friday dissolved Japan's parliament and called general elections for October 20.</p>
<p>November 1987 - Outgoing prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, in office since 1982, picks Noboru Takeshita to succeed him. Takeshita confirmed as prime minister as the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) commands a majority in parliament.</p>
<p>June 1988 - In Recruit &quot;shares-for-favours&quot; scandal Takeshita and other ministers are named as recipients of pre-listed shares of the publishing firm in a shady deal.</p>
<p>December 1988 - Finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa resigns over Recruit. Takeshita pushes through parliament a bill to introduce a politically sensitive sales tax.</p>
<p>June 1989 - Takeshita resigns over Recruit and sales tax. Sosuke Uno succeeds him, but immediately becomes embroiled in scandal over his messy affair with a geisha.</p>
<p>July 1989 - LDP loses majority in Upper House after polls. Uno resigns.</p>
<p>August 1989 - Toshiki Kaifu, dubbed &quot;Mr Clean&quot;, is chosen as prime minister because LDP still retains majority in Lower House, the more powerful of parliament's two chambers.</p>
<p>February 1990 - Kaifu wins Lower House general elections.</p>
<p>November 1991 - Kaifu resigns after his party, led by strongman Ichiro Ozawa, scraps his political reform bills. Former finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa takes over as premier.</p>
<p>January 1992 - Prosecutors arrest a Miyazawa ally for allegedly accepting bribes from a property developer.</p>
<p>May 1992 - Former Kumamoto governor Morihiro Hosokawa forms anti-corruption Japan New Party.</p>
<p>June 1992 - Parliament enacts U.N. peacekeeping cooperation bill, allowing for dispatch of Japan's military overseas. Socialists resist, first by silent filibuster, the &quot;ox walk&quot;, then by resigning from their seats in parliament, to no avail.</p>
<p>October 1992 - Shin Kanemaru, LDP kingmaker and Ozawa's mentor, retires from politics after acknowledging he received illegal funds from a trucking firm.</p>
<p>December 1992 - Ichiro Ozawa and Tsutomu Hata form their own faction in the LDP, splitting from the Takeshita faction.</p>
<p>June 1993 - Ozawa-Hata group and group led by Masayoshi Takemura quit the LDP, and no-confidence vote against Miyazawa is passed. Miyazawa dissolves Lower House for general elections.</p>
<p>July 1993 - The LDP loses Lower House majority in polls. Seven opposition parties agree on a coalition government and name Hosokawa as premier. Yohei Kono is elected LDP president.</p>
<p>January 1994 - Hosokawa pushes political reform bills through parliament.</p>
<p>April 1994 - Hosokawa resigns after opposition LDP targets his shady links to a trucking firm. Tsutomu Hata, an ally of Ozawa, becomes prime minister but Socialists, biggest party in coalition, walk out of the bloc because of moves to freeze them out of decision-making process. Hata heads minority government.</p>
<p>June 1994 - Hata resigns after LDP and Socialists threaten him with no-confidence motion. Parliament elects Tomiichi Murayama as prime minister at head of a formerly unthinkable LDP-Socialist alliance. Takemura's Sakigake party joins in.</p>
<p>July 1994 - Murayama abandons Socialist Party's leftist tenets, including opposition to military and to U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.</p>
<p>December 1994 - Remnants of Hosokawa-Hata coalition form opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), now led by Kaifu, who had defected from LDP in June 1994. Party comes under effective control of Ozawa.</p>
<p>July 1995 - Socialists do badly in Upper House election. Murayama refuses to call Lower House elections.</p>
<p>August 1995 - Ryutaro Hashimoto, trade minister under Murayama, wins election as LDP president. Kono does not run.</p>
<p>December 1995 - Ozawa wins opposition Shinshinto leadership election against his old ally, ex-premier Hata.</p>
<p>January 5, 1996 - Murayama resigns to hand power to Hashimoto and LDP. Murayama refuses to call general elections.</p>

<p>September 13, 1996 - Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota agrees to take steps to renew leases for U.S. military bases on the island, ending a bitter standoff with the central government.</p>
<p>September 27, 1996 - Hashimoto dissolves the Lower House of parliament and sets October 20 as date for general elections.</p>
