<p>Cellular phone company Pilipino Telephone Corp (Piltel) expects to post flat profits this year as it grapples with cloning problems, Juan Velasquez, the company's new chief finance officer said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The company registered net income of 710.468 million pesos in 1996 compared with 822.075 million pesos in 1995. In 1996, the company made provisions of 886.452 million pesos for doubtful accounts.  </p>
<p>&quot;We see our net income performance this year to be flat,&quot; Velasquez said, adding that the company will have to continue to provide for doubtful accounts. He did not elaborate on the amount of provision.</p>
<p>Cloning refers to the fraudulent use of a cellular line, in which unsuspecting subscribers get billed for calls they did not make.</p>
<p>Last October, Piltel said it is targetting net income of 1.4 billion pesos for 1997. Two weeks ago, at least one broker said it had cut its 1997 earnings forecast for Piltel.</p>
<p>Spencer Yap at BPI Capital Corp said earlier this month that BPI had downgraded its 1997 earnings forecast to 800 million pesos from over a billion pesos.</p>
<p>Velasquez said on Wednesday that the company will be introducing its digital cellular service this year that will increase transmission capacity and help retain its status as the cellular operator with the widest nationwide coverage.</p>
