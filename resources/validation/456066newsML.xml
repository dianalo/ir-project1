<p>A local human rights group said on Wednesday the Peruvian army has arrested and tortured dozens of innocent peasants in a sweep in the central jungle searching for members of the Marxist rebel group holding 72 hostages in Lima.</p>
<p>APRODEH said the army detained 38 villagers, including seven children, in the town of Alto Yurinaki on March 9 during an offensive against Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;Abuses, tortures, forced confessions and detentions have occurred in other villages in the central jungle,&quot; APRODEH President Francisco Soberon told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We consider that the majority of those detained are innocent, based on the way the operations were carried out,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The MRTA, whose members are holding 72 dignitaries at the Japanese ambassador's home in Lima for the 92nd day, is the smaller of Peru's two rebel groups and has dwindled in size since its top leaders were arrested in 1992 and 1993.</p>
<p>Experts on Peru's guerrilla wars contend that the MRTA currently numbers no more than 200 fighters, and its last remaining strongholds outside of Lima are in the jungles of Pasco and Junin districts.</p>
<p>The group's accusation comes a day after the Peruvian military announced that the army had arrested 38 &quot;MRTA terrorists&quot; but had respected human rights in its sweep of the group's jungle stronghold.</p>
<p>The Armed Forces Joint Command said in a statement that soldiers also seized 10 automatic rifles and 11 grenades and charged that the rebels planned to attack an army base in Oxapampa, some 200 miles (325 kms) east of Lima.</p>
<p>&quot;A tough blow has been dealt to the MRTA terrorist organisation, preventing it from continuing the violent activities, robberies, lootings and thefts it was carrying out in the zone,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The military did not say when the suspects were caught but as late as last Sunday the rebels said none of their members were detained despite a major offensive to flush them out.</p>
<p>Despite the military' claim that the operation was carried out &quot;with complete respect for human rights,&quot; villagers told local television on Tuesday that soldiers detained peasants unconnected to the MRTA, using electric cables to torture some and shooting to death one man.</p>
<p>&quot;They threw him, pulled him and he probably tried to escape and the (bullet) caught him,&quot; said Florencia Roldan, who said her husband, Fortunato Chipana, was shot and killed by soldiers on Feb. 25.</p>
<p>APRODEH, in its statement on Wednesday, cited specific cases where villagers were wrongly detained and tortured by the army.</p>
<p>One man accused of being an MRTA leader was actually &quot;a poor farmer&quot; and another peasant was detained and tortured when he went to an army base to complain that soldiers passing through his town had robbed him of 1,000 soles ($380), it said.</p>
