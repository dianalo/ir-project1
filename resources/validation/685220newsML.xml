<p>Warwickshire wicket-keeper Keith Piper was fined 500 pounds ($830) and banned for one match after failing a drugs test, the English county side said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Piper, a former England A player, tested positive for cannabis after the entire team was tested on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Both the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the club take a serious view of the offence, believing that it is essential for the clean image of the game of cricket to be protected,&quot; Warwickshire said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The player has agreed to give the club a signed undertaking that he will not be using the drug in future. The club has also offered to provide counselling to the player for this problem as necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>The tests were carried out after the county's former all-rounder Paul Smith was banned from professional cricket for 22 months by the ECB earlier this month for using cocaine.</p>
