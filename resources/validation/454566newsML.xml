<p>New Zealand-based whitegoods manufacturer Fisher and Paykel Ltd said it would open its new expanded washing machine and refrigerator plant in Cleveland in the Queensland capital of Brisbane later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's completion marks a A$90 million investment in Australia,&quot; Fisher and Paykel said in a statement released in Australia.</p>
<p>Fisher and Paykel chief executive Gary Paykel said the plant's new laundry products plant would initially employ 45 people to make 200 washing machines per day, but had the capacity to produce up to 900 machines per day.  </p>
<p>&quot;Its machinery capacity is geared to produce 900 products per day and earthworks have already been constructed for two additional bays to increase the plant's area by 3,000 square metres (from 7,000 square metres),&quot; Paykel said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the laundry plant follows the successful track record of its refrigeration counterpart, it's potential capacity will be needed sooner than later,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Fisher &amp; Paykel also said it planned to launch a new range of products on Thursday, including a new refrigerator, a new dishwasher and new gas cooktops and ovens.  </p>
<p>The Cleveland plant began production in 1990 with 78 people and now makes 100,000 refigerators annually for both domestic and export markets, including Thailand, Singapore, South Africa, New Caledonia, Philippine, Cyprus and Malta and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Fisher and Paykel's main factory is in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
<p>Paykel said Fisher and Paykel Finance Australia had recently started a trial project with a number of Queensland retailers.</p>
<p>Once the software and systems that supported retailers had been fine-tuned, the operation would be extended throughout Australia, he said.  </p>
<p>Fisher and Paykel has also established a health care division in Australia selling a respiratory humidifier, he said.</p>
<p>Email Ltd and Southcorp Holdings Ltd's appliances division are Fisher Paykel's major competitors in Australia. Paykel said Fisher and Paykel currently had a 30 percent share of the laundry machine market in Australia.</p>
