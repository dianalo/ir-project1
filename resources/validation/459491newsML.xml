<p>House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Friday ended a week of Republican hand-wringing over whether he is truly committed to tax cuts by saying he was &quot;deeply committed&quot; to that key piece of the party's agenda.</p>
<p>The Georgia Republican threw his party into disarray on Monday with comments seen as endorsing a delay in tax cuts until after balancing the budget, effectively backing off from a critical piece of the party line.</p>
<p>On Friday, however, Gingrich said his comments were misinterpreted and that he was committed to reducing the tax burden for capital gains, estates and families.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe in cutting taxes,&quot; Gingrich said. &quot;I'm deeply committed to lowering taxes.&quot;</p>
<p>His comments on Monday were intended to convey the message that &quot;what's vital is that this year we balance the budget, we save Medicare and we cut taxes ... but that the precise way we do it is less important than getting it done,&quot; Gingrich said.</p>
<p>&quot;The important thing, whether it's done in one big bundle or whether it's done in a series of steps, is that we get it done ... we should clearly vote on tax cuts before the end of the year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The issue of how to proceed on tax cuts has created divisions between House and Senate leadership, pitted rank-and-file members against party chiefs and led to formations of bipartisan groups within Congress.</p>
<p>Congress will have to tackle breaking that gridlock when it returns from a two-week recess, during which staff-level discussions were expected on overall budget issues.</p>
<p>Republicans and some Democrats, including Clinton, are seeking some form of tax relief this year, but they are divided over the magnitude of cuts and how to proceed. Clinton has proposed $98 billion in tax cuts, Senate Republicans twice that amount, and House Republicans have yet to announce a number.</p>
<p>&quot;I obviously cannot prejudge what the president may decide down the road,&quot; Lawrence Haas, spokesman for the White House budget office, said. But entering into negotiations, &quot;we obviously feel that we can balance the budget and still provide important targeted tax relief for middle-income Americans,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gingrich's comments on Monday elicited an invitation from Clinton to budget leaders for a meeting at the White House, pats on the back from some Republicans and Democrats, but fury from conservatives of his own party.</p>
<p>Eleven Republican conservatives blocked action on Thursday on a measure to fund an investigation of White House fund raising, in part to send a wake-up call to Republican leaders about the need to balance the budget and cut taxes. The group relented on Friday, allowing the House to pass a compromise measure.</p>
<p>The chairmen of the House and Senate tax-writing committees have pushed for tax cuts to be part of an overall budget package, concerned that it would be more difficult to pass tax relief separately.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be hard to envision the politics of getting a separate tax bill through,&quot; Robert Reischauer, senior fellow at The Brookings Institution, said. &quot;You have to have some savings to offset the tax cut,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a significant portion of the Republican party that is more interested in tax cuts than in balancing the budget,&quot; Reischauer added. &quot;That group is a significantly sized portion of the party and they might fight tooth and nail against any plan that didn't include a tax cut,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ultimately some form of tax cuts were expected to be enacted. &quot;It's awful hard to see a situation in which the crown jewel proposal of the Republicans and a proposal that the president has had for two and a half years is jettisoned,&quot; Reischauer said. &quot;It's an awful lot of crow the two sides would eat if they did that,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Some observers said it was still early in the budget process and expectations for quick resolution of the issues were unrealistic.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody's panicking too early here, we're only two-and-a-half months into the year, there's a lot of time left,&quot; Kenneth Kies, chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, said.</p>
