<p>Cash flows into U.S. equity funds fell sharply for the week ended Thursday, as investors left more speculative sectors and continued to shift to fixed incomes funds, according to Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services.</p>
<p>Overall, equity flows fell to $1.3 billion from $3.4 billion the previous week and $6.7 billion for the week a year ago.  </p>
<p>Adler noted that large capitalization growth funds suffered redemptions of $333 million versus inflows of $470 million. Technology funds had outflows of $16 million versus inflows of $187 million. Gold and nautral resources funds had redemptions of $83 million versus inflows of $116 million.</p>
<p>Taxable bond had inflows of $699 million versus $2.5 billion the previous week.  Adler said that most of the recent week's flows came in high yield and investment grade corporate bond funds.</p>
<p>Municipal funds had redemptions of $586 million versus $273 million of inflows.  </p>
<p>Investors also continued to pour money into fixed income funds, especially high yield.  The high yield sector had another bountiful week, with inflows of $371 million versus $1.3 billion the previous week, the largest single weekly flow to any fixed income sector on record, according to AMG (AMGData.com).</p>
<p>&quot;The sentimment that has been focused on equities is spilling over to the bond markets,&quot; said Adler.</p>
