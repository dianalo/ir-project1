<p>Ireland's Central Bank governor Maurice O&quot;Connell said on Tuesday smaller, peripheral European Union states may be treated as second class members in the proposed economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;There is perhaps some room for concern that union might condemn the less-well-off and peripheral regions to second class status,&quot; O'Connell told a European Finance Convention in Dublin.</p>
<p>He was also concerned about a stability pact designed to ensure fiscal discipline among countries that join a single currency, saying that too rigid an application of discipline may stunt growth.</p>
<p>&quot;EMU is essentially about a culture that will impose strong disciplines on its members. The so-called stability pact...is a graphic illustration of this,&quot; O'Connell said. &quot;There is perhaps a residual worry that excessive discipline might stifle growth.&quot;</p>
<p>On round one of EMU which has a target start date of January 1, 1999, O'Connell said there were contradictory signals on how politicians will react if major countries like France and Germany fail to qualify for monetary union according to criteria of EMU's Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not know how the political authorities will cope with the prospect that a majority of countries, maybe France, maybe Germany, may just about fail to satisfy the Maastricht criteria precisely. There are contradictory signals,&quot; O'Connell said.</p>
<p>He said the EU's Dublin summit on December 13-14 is expected to take a number of important decisions that will advance the process towards EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;My understanding is that the heads of state and government will address in particular the exchange rate relations between the so-called &quot;ins&quot; and &quot;outs&quot; and the stability pact,&quot; O&quot;Connell said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are indications that we can look forward to arrangements between the ins and outs that may lower the risk of future currency realignments between the euro area and the currencies of non-participating member States.&quot;</p>
<p>Overall O'Connell said there was a testing time ahead and to lose even marginal credibility in the move towards EMU would be damaging.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets today are exceedingly sensitive and even the smallest credibility gap on the way into EMU could generate undue disturbance. Smaller countries can be particularly vulnerable in this kind of situation so we have a strong vested interest in stability,&quot; O'Connell said.</p>
<p>He said it was not possible to judge now how many countries would be in EMU at the start. &quot;This will depend ultimately  on how the Maastricht criteria are interpreted,&quot; he said, adding that there were still some difficult operational problems to be sorted out at central banking level before EMU could become a reality.</p>
<p>O'Connell also said that an urgent problem in Europe was the 18 milLion people who are formally out of work.</p>
<p>&quot;This is much too many and there is little evidence of an early solution in sight,&quot; O'Connell said.</p>
<p>He said much of Europe has bordered on recession for an extended period though there were recent signs of improvement.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people link the poor (European) performance to the pre-occupation with greater integration and argue that strict criteria of the Maastricht Treaty is damaging to production and employment.&quot;</p>
<p>O'Connell said nobody can conclusively prove that convergence inhibits job creation but maintained that if satisfying the criteria encouraged responsible macro-economic management that was surely conducive to long-term economic growth.</p>
