<headline>INTERVIEW - Federated Dept Stores new CEO.</headline>

<p>Federated Department Stores Inc president James Zimmerman, designated Thursday to become chairman and chief executive officer in May, said he plans to keep growing the nation's largest department store retailer.</p>
<p>&quot;We think we have a lot of opportunities to continue to be a growth company,&quot; Zimmerman said in a telephone interview. &quot;First of all we have to run the base business right and continue... comp-store (same store) sales growth (around three percent).&quot;  </p>
<p>The Cincinnati-based retailer will still seek acquisitions but none is in the works, he said in the interview Thursday.</p>
<p>He declined to speculate on possible targets but said a small or &quot;normal&quot; sized acquisition every few years, coupled with internal growth, would keep the company on track. It acquired R.H. Macy Co in 1994 and Broadway Stores Inc in 1995.</p>
<p>Federated's stores also include Bloomingdale's, The Bon Marche, Burdines, Goldsmith's, Lazarus, Rich's and Stern's.</p>
<p>In the year ended February 1996, net income was $332.8 million, or $1.82 a share, on $15 billion sales.  </p>
<p>Wall Street analysts said they do not expect Zimmerman to change Federated's strategy since he helped design it.</p>
<p>They said Zimmerman, 52, president since 1988, is the logical successor to Allen Questrom, 57, who engineered Federated's transformation.</p>
<p>McDonald &amp; Co analyst Jeff Stein said, &quot;I think Allen certainly was the visionary that helped put this $15 billion company together and get it back on its feet following the (1990-92) bankruptcy. But Jim Zimmerman is probably one of the most highly respected retail executives in the United States.&quot;  </p>
<p>Bear Stearns &amp; Co analyst Steven Kernkraut said Zimmerman has been Questrom's partner for years in running Federated.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been kind of an open secret (that) Allen Questrom was not going to stay until (age) 65,&quot; he said. &quot;Zimmerman is a very capable executive, merchant and administrator.&quot;</p>
<p>Zimmerman will succeed Questrom at the top post May 16. Terry Lundgren, 44, who heads merchandising and product development,will be president and chief merchandising officer.</p>
<p>Zimmerman stressed, &quot;The priorities and strategies of the company absolutely will be the same.&quot; He said he, Lundgren and others were part of Questrom's team mapping those strategies.  </p>
<p>Earnings-per-share growth is expected to be &quot;even greater than the top-line growth rate,&quot; Zimmerman said, as the retailer continues to pay down debt, cut costs and refine distribution. He did not specify an earnings growth target.</p>
<p>Zimmerman said Federated was pleased with 3.2 percent growth in same-store sales over a year ago in the November-December holiday period. On a same-store basis for the year through November, sales grew 3.5 percent. The company plans to add to sales growth with five new stores and one replacement in 1997 and six new stores in 1998, he said.</p>
<p>It will also explore new concepts, including Macy's by Mail, similar to existing Bloomingdale's by Mail.</p>
<p>Lundgren, who sat in on the Zimmerman interview, said Federated &quot;private brands,&quot; private-label lines touted as national brands, will remain a focus. Ads for its Charter Club line will begin in March, part of $20 million private-brand advertising in 1997.</p>
<p>Leaving after 30 years with Federated, Questrom said in a statement, &quot;Having done what I set out to do, the time now is right for me to leave.&quot; He plans to travel and relax then in a few months &quot;look for new mountains to climb.&quot;</p>
