<p>---------------------------(JULY 7)-----------------------------</p>
<p>The short end of New Zealand's yield curve closed sharply higher on Monday as a market tending towards bearishness took exception to a fall in the currency's Trade-Weighted Index.</p>
<p>Key 90-day bank bill rates ended eight basis points above last week's levels, at 7.28 percent, after a promising open at 7.12 percent.</p>
<p>The September futures contract closed seven weaker at 92.85, for an implied yield of 7.15 percent, against its 92.97 open.  </p>
<p>Flows were reasonable in that contract, with 3,035 contracts traded, but the NZ Futures and Options Exchange said overall trade was light.</p>
<p>The TWI fell steeply during the session to end at 66.14 from its 66.41 open and 66.25 close last week, and dealers said the hike in the overnight cash rate late last week to 7.5 percent from 6.55 percent had not helped sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess it has become a little bit expensive to hold some of these bills at the moment,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>He said there was a marked lack of buying interest from the banking community, despite a suspicion that the market might be reaching good value at these levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody's going to lead the charge until they see a convincing movement in the currency or on that Monetary Conditions Index (MCI),&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The MCI is now at 765.95, meaning monetary conditions are 59 basis points (in interest rate terms) easier than the central bank's desired level.  </p>
<p>The session's weakness fed right through the curve, with the mid bonds ended three pips weaker at 6.72 percent and the 11/06 maturity also up three in yield to 6.91 percent.</p>
