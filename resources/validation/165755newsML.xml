<headline>LOW SEPT OIL PRICES HELP KEEP LID ON S.AFRICAN PPI.</headline>

<text>
<p>A relatively large monthly decrease of 2.2 percent in the price of imported crude oil helped keep the lid on South African producer price inflation in September, the Central Statistical Service said.</p>
<p>The decrease contributed to a low 0.1 month-on-month increase in the cost of imported goods.</p>
<p>But analysts noted this gain would be wiped out in succeeding months following a recent sharp increase in oil prices.</p>
<p>Among all commodities for South African consumption there were relatively large monthly increases in the cost of food at manufacturing (+0.7 percent), agricultural products (+2.1 percent), fish (+4.6 percent), textiles (+0.8 percent), wearing apparel (+2.5 percent), products of petroleum and coal (+1.7 percent) and non-electrical machinery and equipment (+1.0 percent).</p>
<p>These increases were offset by falls in the indices for mining and quarrying products (-2.1 percent) and electrcitiy (-0.9 percent).</p>
<p>Import prices increased in the case of several manufactured goods including non-electrical machinery and equipment (+2.2 percent), food (+4.0 percent), beverages (+0.2 percent), paper (+0.3 percent), chemicals (+0.5 percent) and transport equipment (+0.1 percent).</p>
<p>But these increases were offset by falls in the cost of some primary sector imports, including mining and quarrying products (-1.9 percent due to cheaper oil), agricultural food (-4.5 percent) and other agriculture (-0.6 percent).</p>
<p>September PPI came in significantly lower than expected at 0.4 percent month-on-month and 7.6 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>A Reuters consensus poll of economists forecast PPI would rise 0.9 percent month-on-month and 8.2 percent year-on-year. </p>
