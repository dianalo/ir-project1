<p>NATO aims to set the seal on its new partnership with Russia by the end of May, alliance officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;That's not an official deadline, but it comes out of the logic of things,&quot; one official said in reply to a question.</p>
<p>If the target is met, U.S. President Bill Clinton would be able to drop into Brussels for the signing ceremony at the end of May before going to the Netherlands for a summit meeting with the European Union, the officials said.</p>
<p>The target has been set to help make good an undertaking to have the deal, outlined by Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Helsinki last week, in place before the July 8-9 North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit meeting in Madrid.</p>
<p>At the Madrid meeting the western military alliance intends to invite an advance guard of former foes from eastern Europe to open membership talks.</p>
<p>Leading the long list of candidates are Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>At their Helsinki summit last Friday, Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to disagree on NATO's expansion plans but vowed to press ahead with the charter to set a new relationship between Russia and the 16-nation alliance.</p>
<p>NATO officials said on Tuesday the alliance's Secretary General Javier Solana would travel to Moscow in mid-April for new talks with Russia, with the aim of making progress on outstanding points, including a Russian demand for limits on NATO infrastructure on the soil of its former allies.</p>
<p>A senior NATO official said on Tuesday the western alliance would not accept Russian limits, but that NATO would be open about what it was doing.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not prepared to accept limits on infrastructure. There are things that are going to have to be done to bring countries into NATO,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to do what's necessary to make people allies and not second class allies,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Even before the Helsinki summit NATO, offering an olive branch to Russia over the alliance's eastward expansion plans, said it would not station any permanent new troops in Europe in the forseeable future.</p>
