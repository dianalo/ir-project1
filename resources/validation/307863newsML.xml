<p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has terminated nearly 300 paging licenses held by MobileMedia Corp, MobileMedia said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Specifically, the FCC terminated approximately 185 authorizations for unconstructed paging facilities and 99 authorizations for facilities completed after the expiration date of their construction permits.</p>
<p>MobileMedia is permitted to operate from those completed facilities on an interim basis until the FCC takes further action, the company said.  </p>
<p>The FCC's action does not affect other existing paging facilities or MobileMedia's nationwide paging authorizations, the company said.</p>
<p>Further, the FCC dismissed approximately 94 applications for fill-in sites around existing paging stations as defective because they were predicated on unconstructed facilties. Those applications had been filed under the &quot;40-mile rule,&quot; MobileMedia said.</p>
<p>The FCC issued a Public Notice relating to the status of the authorizations on Monday.  </p>
<p>MobileMedia in December said it might seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after it failed to make a scheduled $5.6 million interest payment on its 9-3/8 percent senior subordinated debt due 2007.</p>
<p>The company said it was uncertain how the FCC notice would affect current and future operations, but it &quot;could have a material adverse impact upon the financial condition or operations of the company.&quot;  The company had said it discovered misrepresentations and other violations which occurred during the licensing procedure for six percent to seven percent of its approximate 8,000 local transmission one-way paging stations.</p>
