<p>C-Cube Microsystems Inc President and CEO Alex Balkanski said the company sees explosive opportunities in the markets for digital video compression and decompression chips.</p>
<p>Balkanski said in a presentation to investors at the Robertson Stephens conference here that he expects 12-14 million VideoCD machines to be shipped in 1997, up from seven million in 1996 and 1.7 million in 1995.</p>
<p>Balkanski told reporters he expects products in the emerging market for Digital Video Disks to account for 15 percent of the company's sales in 1997, with most of this weighted to the back end of the calendar year.</p>
<p>DVD sales accounted for just one percent of C-Cube's revenues in the fourth quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Balkanski said that if sales of DVD devices hit the two to three million units projected by independent researchers for 1997, the industry could sell five to seven million units next year.</p>
<p>&quot;Even at two million units it will be the most rapidly adapted new format ever,&quot; he said of DVD.</p>
<p>The C-Cube CEO said in 1996 North America had accounted for 43 percent of revenues, Asia Pacific for 42 percent, with Japan at 8 percent and Europe at 7 percent, with the latter two areas growing to more than 10 percent in the current year.</p>
<p>&quot;By the end of the year I expect Europe and Japan to be healthily in double digits,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Balkanski declined to speak about estimates for 1997 but said DVD products will be consistent with the company's model of 50 percent-plus gross margins. It has recently been reporting gross margins in the mid-50s.</p>
<p>&quot;These markets are embryonic today. These are exponential opportunities,&quot; he said, adding C-Cube will need to be selective about which opportunities it pursues. &quot;DVD is one of thse opportunities.&quot; ((sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400))</p>
