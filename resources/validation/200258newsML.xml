<p>Spain and the United States agreed to work towards liberalising air travel between the two countries and to cooperate in airport security, a spokesman for the Spanish ministry of development said.</p>
<p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena met Spain's Development Minister Rafael Arias-Salgado on Monday, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>A bilateral air transport agreement between the two countries, which determines which airlines can fly where, was last revised in 1991. It has no fixed expiry date and can be updated at any time, the Spanish civil aviation department said.</p>
<p>A move towards an &quot;Open Skies&quot; deal between the U.S. and Spain could be an important factor in state airline Iberia forging a partnership with a U.S. carrier.</p>
<p>If Iberia were to form a partnership with for example American Airlines, greater freedom for U.S. airlines to fly to Spain or for Spanish carriers to enter the U.S. could be a part of the deal.</p>
<p>Iberia's new chairman Xabier de Irala favours a partnership with American and British Airways although he has said the company is in negotiations with several candidates.</p>
<p>A report in the ABC newspaper last weekend cited Iberia sources as saying that a deal with American would involve developing Miami as a hub for Iberia's flights to Latin America and Madrid as a hub for Latin American flights into Europe.</p>
<p>Iberia did not comment on the report.</p>
<p>There was no more information available on how the negotiations towards an agreement would proceed.</p>
