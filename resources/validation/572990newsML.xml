<p>U.S. Treasuries bounced in London on overnight comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, and the market remains optimistic, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen solid buying out of the Far East,&quot; said Nick Benton, U.S. Treasuries trader at Bank of America here. &quot;The market has interpreted Greenspan's comments to mean there will not be a rate hike at the end of May.&quot;</p>
<p>In a speech released after markets closed in New York on Thursday, Greenspan said he expected economic growth to slow later this year and into next.</p>
<p>The long bond propelled higher from a New York close of 96-03 to 96-17 at the end of the Tokyo session. It picked up more speed in London, trading at 96-24 by 0939 GMT, to yield 6.881 percent.</p>
<p>June T-bond futures were trading at 110-05 at 0949 GMT on the first day of a new LIFFE/CBOT trading link.</p>
<p>Greenspan added in his speech, &quot;Should the expected slowing in the growth of demand fail to materialise, we would need to address any emerging pressures in product and credit markets.&quot;</p>
<p>This was taken to mean Greenspan is more likely to raise interest rates at July's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting than at the next FOMC meeting on May 20, Benton said.</p>
<p>The bullish mood is likely to continue into the New York session, with no key economic indicators expected on Friday, dealers said. But they added the bond market was vulnerable to any slowdown in stock prices.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an awful lot of optimism in the market on the view that the economy is about to slow,&quot; said Michael Burke, senior bond strategist at Citibank in London.</p>
<p>&quot;That has been the view for the past six to nine months, and it just hasn't happened.&quot;</p>
<p>The LIFFE/CBOT trading link enjoyed reasonable volume in its first day of trading.</p>
<p>But traders said the link, which also allows LIFFE Bund futures to be traded at the Chicago Board of Trade, faced stiff competition from Project A, the CBOT after-hours electronic trading system.</p>
<p>LIFFE turnover was not as strong as they expected, traders added.</p>
<p>By 0955 GMT, nearly 3,200 contracts had changed hands on LIFFE in the June contract.</p>
