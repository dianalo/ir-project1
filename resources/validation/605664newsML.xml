<p>With no economic data on Friday and early closures of the futures and cash market, U.S. fixed income traders are anticipating an early departure for a long holiday weekend, analysts said.</p>
<p>The only event of interest on Friday's calendar is a speech by Federal Reserve Board member Laurence Meyer scheduled for early Friday afternoon, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;People will be really keyed into that. He's always someone that people will watch out for,&quot; said Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data.  </p>
<p>But dealers may start to vacate their desks around 1400 EDT/1800 GMT at the suggestion of PSA, the Bond Market Trade Association.</p>
<p>The association recommends an early close for the cash market on Friday. Meanwhile, the Chicago Board of Trade said trade in financial futures products will shut at 1210 CDT/1710 GMT.</p>
<p>U.S. markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day.</p>
<p>Treasuries will probably experience residual fallout on Friday from the Fed's steady rate decision on Tuesday, bond experts said.  </p>
<p>One of the main features of trade since Tuesday -- significant hedge fund selling, which knocked the long-end of market down and saw the 30-year bond touch a yield of 7.00 percent on Thursday -- will probably extend into Friday, analysts said.</p>
<p>But the coupon sector could experience some reversal of the curve-steepening seen in the wake of the Fed's inaction, experts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Whether people actually just had front-end stuff dumped in their laps and hedged it by selling longer-end stuff or did that proactively, it seems like there are steepening trades on right now and those could come unwound before the weekend,&quot; Burtnick said.</p>
<p>The release of the minutes of the Fed's March 25 board meeting, created a bit of confusion on Thursday by showing that the FOMC voted 10-0 to move to a neutral policy -- from a tightening bias -- at the same time they raised rates.  </p>
<p>Analysts said they would have to assume if the Fed went neutral in March, they are neutral currently. That probably signals very hot economic data will be needed in July to shift them up to a tightening bias.</p>
<p>&quot;With a reduced probability of a hike, it's going to be easier for me to say let me go earn some carry in here,&quot; said Larry Dyer, goverment bond strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
<p>&quot;If I look at the moves we've had so far, I would expect this would generally give you a better bid in the front end, where you can earn some more carry,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>((--212 859 1667))  </p>
<p>But around current levels, especially if the long-bond yield reached 7.0 to 7.05 percent, the 30-year will probably look pretty attractive amid a shrinking supply of treasury stock, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you've got too many players who'd say let's take a flyer on the thing,&quot; said a bond strategist at a primary dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;Since there is a limited amount of supply out there, it wouldn't take too much to bottom it. Any type of moderation of economic numbers and the (Wall) Street, they are short and everyone's got to cover it,&quot; the strategist said.</p>
