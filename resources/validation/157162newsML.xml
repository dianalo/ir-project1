<p>Spain's 1997 budget, the key to its European aspirations, will not founder on what critics have called over-optimistic growth forecasts, Secretary of the Exchequer Juan Costa told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I am absolutely convinced that from the point of view of revenues this government is not going to have the least problem implementing the budget,&quot; Costa said in an interview.</p>
<p>The five-month-old minority Popular Party government has pledged that Spain will join in the launch of the European single currency in 1999, and next year's budget will provide the testing ground for its economic fitness.</p>
<p>One of the government's thorniest tasks in whipping Spain into shape for the launch is to bring down the deficit to three percent of gross domestic product in 1997 from a projected 4.4 percent this year and 6.6 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>But Costa dismissed critics who argued the government had achieved this goal in its budget draft by employing overly ambitious estimates of revenue growth.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first budget based on a realistic forecast of revenues. First the budget for revenues was made up, and then the expenditure budget was based on it,&quot; Costa said. &quot;The former government did it the other way around.&quot;</p>
<p>The budget foresees revenue growth in 1997 of just under six percent, the rough equivalent of the economy's nominal growth. Gross domestic product growth is seen at a real three percent.</p>
<p>Spending growth will be capped at 1.7 percent, which represents an expenditure cut of nearly one percentage point given inflation forecasts of 2.6 percent.</p>
<p>Economists, in general, were convinced by the stringent expenditure regime.</p>
<p>However some took issue with expected growth rates, for example the forecast that income tax revenues would grow by 6.8 percent or that value-added-tax receipts would rise eight percent next year.</p>
<p>But Costa said the growth rates were reasonable. They might appear large because this year -- the comparative year for the budget -- revenues were diminished by the need to make income tax refunds delayed from previous years.</p>
<p>&quot;We have budgeted in a very reasonable way,&quot; Costa said. &quot;If you eliminated the refund policy...the growth rate would be lower.&quot;</p>
<p>To meet Europe's single currency requirements, Spain must also curb inflation, reduce its debt burden and adhere to criteria on currency stability and long-term interest rates.</p>
