<p>Northern Ireland peace talks resume on Monday against a bleak backdrop of mounting sectarian attacks and warnings that guerrilla violence will erupt again unless swift political progress is made.</p>
<p>The United States, a key player in attempts to reconcile feuding Protestants and Catholics, has expressed alarm at the steadily deteriorating political and social climate since sectarian violence flared over the summer.</p>
<p>Jean Kennedy Smith, U.S. ambassador to the Republic of Ireland, said in a speech that ordinary people were living in fear since communal violence erupted over a Protestant Orange Order march at the small town of Drumcree in July.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been aghast and shaken at the naked sectarianism that has risen from the ashes of Drumcree, by the senseless discrimination that fragments already struggling communities, by the childish and cruel protests against families as they headed to church to worship,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She was referring to a wave of incidents in which churches have been attacked by extremists, businesses boycotted by both communities and worshippers picketed on their way to a Catholic church.</p>
<p>The grass-roots sectarianism has its extreme expression in the actions of the self-styled guardian armies of the two communities, Catholic-backed Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas fighting to end British rule of the province and Protestant Loyalists battling to maintain it.</p>
<p>The IRA has not struck targets in Northern Ireland since it broke a 17-month ceasefire last February -- limiting itself to bomb attacks on the British mainland -- and its Protestant Loyalist rivals have stuck to an uneasy truce of their own.</p>
<p>But police say any IRA attack in Northern Ireland itself would unleash a wave of Loyalist reprisals that would return the province to a 25-year war which killed 3,200 and consign the faltering peace process to oblivion.</p>
<p>The discovery of an IRA bomb factory in London last week has underlined the absence at the multi-party Belfast peace talks of the guerrillas' political wing, Sinn Fein.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein is excluded from the talks by the British and Irish governments until there is a new IRA ceasefire, but the guerrillas refuses to lay down their arms for fear that their Protestant rivals will use the negotiations to try to force a wholesale surrender of weapons.</p>
<p>The talks group Protestant Unionist parties, which are committed to British rule, and the moderate Catholic-backed Social Democratic and Labour party.</p>
<p>The negotiations have been mired in procedural issues since opening in June and have failed to hold one plenary session devoted to discussion of substantive issues.</p>
<p>The IRA's resumptiopn of bomb attacks on British targets has been aimed at getting Britain to drop its insistence that the guerrillas &quot;decomission&quot; weapons as the talks proceed.</p>
<p>&quot;The current protracted vacuum is extremely dangerous and needs to be filled as a matter of urgency with real talks. All sensible people know that preconditions prevent this,&quot; Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said at the weekend.</p>
<p>At the same time sources close to the Loyalists say they are close to ending a truce which has been in effect since 1994 because of the renewed IRA violence and the failure of the British government to free jailed activists from either side.</p>
