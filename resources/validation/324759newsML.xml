<headline>&quot;Yellow Ribbon&quot; songwriter dies in New Jersey.</headline>
<dateline>LIVINGSTON, N.J. 1997-01-22</dateline>

<p>Irwin Levine, who co-wrote the hit song &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree,&quot; has died at the age of 58, a hospital spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Levine died on Tuesday at St. Barnabas Medical Centre in Livingston, New Jersey. The hospital declined to disclose his illness or the cause of death.</p>
<p>Levine was honoured by the Smithsonian Institution for the song, which he co-wrote with Larry Brown in suburban New Jersey west of New York City. It was originally recorded by Tony Orlando and Dawn and topped the charts for four weeks in 1973. Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby also performed the song.</p>
<p>There have been some 2,000 versions made since the original hit, becoming the second-most recorded song in history. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, &quot;Yesterday&quot; by the Beatles is the most recorded song.</p>
<p>Levine and Brown collaborated on some 40 hits including &quot;Knock Three Times&quot; and &quot;Sweet Gypsy Rose,&quot; but it was &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon&quot; that made them famous, becoming popular again as an anthem and a symbol of hope during the 15-month American hostage crisis in Iran that ended in January 1981.</p>
<p>At the end of the Iranian drama, when some freed hostages wore yellow ribbons, Levine was quoted by The New York Times as saying &quot;for someone who writes for a living I was at a loss for words. It was one of the greatest moments of my life.&quot;</p>
<p>Yellow ribbons were also tied in communities across the United States for Americans taken hostage in Lebanon in the mid-1980s and during the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>&quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Around the Old Oak Tree&quot; was about the homecoming given a released prisoner and music historians trace the yellow ribbon image to a 19th Century army song.</p>
<p>Brown said in 1991 that their song was based on a story he had read of a soldier coming home from the Civil War who wrote to his loved one that if he was still welcome home after the war, she should tie a handkerchief around a certain tree.</p>
<p>Brown said the handkerchief was not particularly romantic so he and Levine changed it to a yellow ribbon.</p>
<p>Levine was born in Newark. He is survived by his wife Sheila, two daughters and a son. Services will be held for him at the Menorah Chapels in Union, New Jersey, on Thursday.</p>
