<p>Serbia's efforts to finance the 1997 wheat sowing from sales of wheat forward contracts seem to be heading for failure unless the issuer changes the conditions, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Belgrade Stock Exchange (BSE) said only 14.625 million dinars worth of contracts had been sold since they went on offer on October 3.</p>
<p>The Serbian Commodity Reserve Agency offered two tranches of wheat selling contracts, maturing July 15, 1997, worth nearly 150 million dinars ($30 million).</p>
<p>According to earlier government statements, the agency was to finance the advance purchase of up to 1.2 million tonnes of the 1997 wheat crop by issuing the contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commodity Reserve Agency may either withdraw the issue or try to improve conditions, change the price and better organise sale to individuals, in order to sell off the whole tranche,&quot; said an analyst who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>The contract's face value is 9,000 dinars, with 10 tonnes of wheat sold as collateral and a 32 percent discount.</p>
<p>Wheat contracts provide the holder with an export licence.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a great interest at first, but due to tight liquidity, banks have not appeared as buyers yet,&quot; BSE general manager Pava Zecevic told a news conference.</p>
<p>Economists also cited distrust in the country's financial system, fear of instability and the dinar devaluation as reasons for low demand.</p>
<p>In an attempt to avoid the reserve requirement, recently increased to 15 from 10 percent, commercial banks have appealed to the central bank to review the decision and allow half of the planned reserve requirement to be held in wheat contracts.</p>
<p>If the appeal is accepted, banks have said they would pour 75-80 million dinars into wheat contracts.</p>
<p>But Nikola Arandjelovic, head of the largest Yugoslav brokerage, Trziste Novca, said banks were not prepared to commit funds for a period as long as 285 days.</p>
<p>Instead, they were more interested in funding wheat sowing via the usual commercial credits.</p>
<p>So far, flour mills and bakeries have been the sole investors, buying for their own needs, Zecevic said.</p>
<p>&quot;They would have bought even more if they had an adequate support from banks.&quot;</p>
<p>But Zecevic was hopeful that more interest would emerge towards December 2, the end of the sale period.</p>
