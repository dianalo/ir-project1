<p>Foreign Minister Inder Gujral on Wednesday offered key trade incentives to India's neighbours, including Pakistan, as part of a new thrust to replace regional squabbles with flourishing business ties.</p>
<p>Gujral told Reuters in an interview that his foreign policy, described by western diplomats as the &quot;Gujral Doctrine&quot;, was aimed at consolidating old ties with Moscow and building new business-driven relations with the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;I look at the Indian foreign policy in the post-Cold War, global context,&quot; Gujral said. &quot;No country in the world is looking at the globe in totality. Every country is shaping its policy in terms of regional cooperation.&quot;</p>
<p>Leafing through a crowded diplomatic schedule, including the revival of official-level talks with Pakistan late next week, Gujral outlined his ambitious vision of &quot;concentric circles&quot; of regional and global ties.</p>
<p>They ranged from the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) involving India's immediate neighbours, to the Indian Ocean rim states led by South Africa in the west, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to the east.</p>
<p>&quot;We worked together as SAARC. Now we are trying to move further. Not away from it, but as a part of it.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact we are trying to give SAARC more meat and a practical direction,&quot; he said. &quot;That is the sense of my thinking on sub-regional cooperation.&quot;</p>
<p>That cooperation involves allowing land-locked Nepal a key passage through Indian territory into Bangladesh where the Himalayan kingdom would use the port of Chittagong for trade.</p>
<p>Seven northeastern Indian states flank Bangladesh. &quot;These are natural markets for Bangladesh. Dhaka could well become the Hong Kong of the region.</p>
<p>&quot;We think in terms of reviving the type of economic cooperation units which used to exist in pre-Partition days,&quot; Gujral said referring to the 1947 independence from British rule for India and Pakistan of which Bangladesh was then a part.</p>
<p>&quot;Similarly, the southern Indian states could provide markets for Sri Lanka and the Maldives,&quot; Gujral said. &quot;Beginning with April our tariffs will be slashed and non-trade barriers with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka removed.&quot;</p>
<p>Gujral also sought a role for Pakistan with which India has fought three wars since 1947, two of them over Kashmir.</p>
<p>&quot;The sub-regional cooperation under no circumstances is meant to isolate Pakistan, no. As a matter of fact I feel that a stage must come soon, when Pakistan can be involved in sub-regional cooperation in the north of India.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody is trying to undo the Partition, no one can even dream of that,&quot; he said.&quot;</p>
<p>If Gujral has his way, India's border states of Rajasthan and Punjab could revive old business ties with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Gujral, who is currently in his second stint as foreign minister, said he would visit Washington on April 15 for four days &quot;to open my account with the new administration&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Our relations with America will always be remarkably important. America is our largest investor and continues to be the largest trade partner.&quot;</p>
<p>Gujral will also accompany Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda to Moscow on March 24 when the two countries are expected to boost their defence cooperation.</p>
<p>&quot;We always remember with gratitude the way Moscow helped us in our difficult days,&quot; Gujral said of ties with the former Soviet Union when India was its most important non-communist ally.</p>
<p>&quot;Now there is a new vision in the relationship,&quot; he said. &quot;We are willing to hold their hand wherever necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So I look at it this way -- India becoming a hub between ASEAN, Central Asia, SAARC and the Indian Ocean rim,&quot; Gujral added.</p>
