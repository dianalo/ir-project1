<p>South Africa's minister in charge of land reform and farming said on Monday the scrapping of apartheid-era subsidies for white farmers would change the face of agriculture in much of the country.</p>
<p>Derek Hanekom, African National Congress minister of land affairs and agriculture, said in an interview that marketing control boards like those for maize and deciduous fruit would be scrapped or changed beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Hanekom, who took over the agriculture portfolio from a member of the white-led National Party in July, said he wanted to swing South African farming towards a lower input, sustainable system.</p>
<p>He inherited a system of price supports and drought relief introduced by the National Party during its 46 years in power to win the support of white farmers.</p>
<p>The result was that farmers could grow maize on vast ranches in drought-prone areas like Free State province, relying on the government to bail them out in bad years.</p>
<p>&quot;People will continue growing maize in the Free State, but differently, as a result of a changed policy environment,&quot; Hanekom said.</p>
<p>&quot;Maize farmers are no longer enjoying subsidies, and the market prevails so it isn't a subsidised price anymore, it's the market price and they have to take that risk...</p>
<p>&quot;They know they will have to protect themselves and they will change their cropping practices. In the marginal lands most of them will either plant less maize or they will switch altogether to livestock.&quot;</p>
<p>Hanekom said any government relief paid out during drought disasters should go not to the farmers but to the poor, the sick and the elderly.</p>
<p>&quot;My own view is that there shouldn't be any provision for drought relief for farmers.&quot;</p>
<p>Hanekom said that a programme of land redistribution, intended to redress racially skewed ownership that developed under white-minority rule, meant many large farms now owned by a single white family would in future be sub-divided or run as communal operations by blacks.</p>
<p>He said a farm products marketing bill before parliament would reform the previous system of control boards with a view to achieving greater competitiveness, efficiency and food security.</p>
<p>&quot;So the maize board, many of the control boards, will just come to an end, there's no doubt about it. Or they'll change form,&quot; he said, adding that the board controlling the marketing of deciduous fruit was among those that would be scrapped.</p>
