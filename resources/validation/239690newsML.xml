<p>Bosnian Croat soldiers said they forced a Moslem women from her home in west Mostar in the latest in a series of ethnic expulsions, a U.N. spokesman reported on Friday.</p>
<p>The woman recognised one of the seven armed and uniformed men who broke into her apartment as a member of the 2nd HVO (Bosnian Croat army) brigade.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday we met the brigade and they acknowledged they did evict one person,&quot; said Alex Ivanko on behalf of U.N. police who monitor criminal activity.</p>
<p>Bosnian Croats, still defiantly struggling to make their half of divided Mostar communally pure, have ignored international opinion and stepped up a campaign of intimidation that has seen nearly one eviction a day in the last week.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a little depressing that while the London conference was in full swing another Moslem was evicted from her home on Wednesday,&quot; Ivanko said.</p>
<p>The London conference, which gathered foreign ministers and concerned groups to review Bosnia after a year of peace, won renewed pledges to fully implement the Dayton accord that allows refugees to return home and demands respect for human rights.</p>
<p>Although the U.N. has long condemned local authorities in Mostar and other parts of Bosnia for implicitly backing the &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; that Dayton was meant to end they have had trouble identifying its shadowy perpetrators.</p>
<p>The statement by the Bosnian Croat military, long thought to be an ill-disciplined separatist militia, may compel NATO's peace force, which supervises the behaviour of Bosnia's soldiers, to take a stand.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seriously disturbed by reports of HVO involvement,&quot; said peace force spokesman Major Brett Boudreau.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly if there is involvement, proven involvement of the HVO, then of course we would be taking action, though the specifics are still under discussion,&quot; Boudreau added.</p>
<p>Moslems and Croats fought a bitter 11-month war in Mostar in 1993-1994 that left the biggest city in southern Bosnia divided into a Croat western half and a Moslem east.</p>
<p>Only some 3,000 Moslems and 800 Serbs, mainly elderly, now live amongst 55,000 Croats on the west bank of the Neretva river which runs through Mostar.</p>
<p>NATO has previously shied from action to counter continued ethnic intimidation, maintaining it is a policing problem, even though local police forces sponsor much of the violence.</p>
<p>The United Nations Children's Fund added its condemnation on Friday, citing the case of a nine-year-old Moslem girl who watched her parents being beaten with pistol butts and was herself threatened with a gun by six masked men last week.</p>
<p>European Union attempts to reintegrate the city with the help of $172 million in reconstruction aid have failed, diplomats say, partly because of the continued support Mostar Croats receive from Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman.</p>
