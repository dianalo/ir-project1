<headline>Canada wheat to U.S. a 'grave concern,' USDA says.</headline>

<p>The possibility of a surge in Canadian wheat and barley shipments to the United States is a &quot;grave concern&quot; to the U.S. goverment and U.S. farmers, said Gus Schumacher, head of U.S. Agriculture Department's Foreign Agricultural Service.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters Thursday after testifying before a House Agriculture subcommittee, Schumacher said he met Wednesday with Canada's Deputy Minister of Agriculture Frank Croydon for more than six hours, and that much of the time was devoted to discussing Canadian wheat exports to the U.S.</p>
<p>Schumacher said Canadian officials are seriously discussing voluntarily limiting their wheat and barley exports to the United States this year to 1.4-1.5 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Schumacher said earlier in testimony that USDA had received reports that Canada had told U.S. officials that it would try not to exceed that limit, and he said officials would get that issue clarified in grain consultations in Ottawa next week.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope this is what they do,&quot; he said. Schumacher said the USDA has been closely monitoring Canadian wheat and barley imports and said shipments are already close to the levels agreed to in a 1994 understanding between the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, a spokesman for Canadian Agriculture Minister Ralph Goodale said Canada has &quot;no interest at all&quot; in limiting wheat exports to the United States in the current crop year.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no interest at all in a cap. Canada is trading fairly and freely with the United States under all existing trading rules. The level of exports to the U.S. are up from last year but nowhere near the level of 1993/94. Under the new trade agreements there are no caps,&quot; Goodale spokesman Vern Greenshields told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Schumacher was unavailable for reaction to the comments from Goodale's office, but he noted earlier to reproters that whether to voluntarily cap exports is a &quot;very difficult&quot; problem for Canadian officials politically. He said hoped that this issue would not be allowed to harm the good relationship between Washington and Ottawa.</p>
<p>Schumacher, in testimony to lawmakers, repeated warnings from U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, saying, &quot;this administration simply will not tolerate market disruptions by Canadian grain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The United States will not sit idly by and permit another surge in imports, such as that which occurred in 1994 ... The United States is not going to be the dumping ground for Canada's large grain supplies,&quot; said Schumacher.</p>
