<p>The Swedish Trade Council said on Wednesday 1996 exports so far, fared better than originally forecast in the wake of the stronger crown and a slowdown in economic growth but still warned of potential risks.</p>
<p>The council's chief economist, Mauro Gozzo, said exports have been surprising good so far this year but warned if the crown continued to strengthen, exports could suffer.</p>
<p>&quot;Export orders in the first half of 1996 have been positive without being brilliant,&quot; Gozzo said on Wednesday as he released the council's market overview.</p>
<p>Last spring, the Swedish Trade Council forecast zero growth for exports in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Now it's clear that it will be over zero, but I don't think it will be as high as five percent, which some believe,&quot; said Gozzo.</p>
<p>The volume of exports rose two percent in the first six months of this year compared to the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Sweden's central statistics bureau, Statistics Sweden, said export prices fell by three percent in the first half of the year, which indicated a volume rise of five percent.</p>
<p>&quot;But we think this is a little too optimistic because the changes in real prices affect the volume with a certain lag,&quot; Gozzo said.</p>
<p>In calendar 1995, exports totalled 564 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Gozzo said demand from Nordic neighbours, Norway and Finland, had underpinned exports so far this year.</p>
<p>&quot;It is really Norway and Finland who have pulled up the figures as they are so influential,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Even exports to Japan had done well, he said.</p>
<p>But Gozzo warned the strength of the Asian market could suffer when earlier incentive measures come to an end. This could put the brake on growth while the weaker yen boosted exports from Japan.</p>
