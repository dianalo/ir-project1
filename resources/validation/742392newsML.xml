<p>South African gold shares finished firmer on Monday but off highs reached in the morning as the volatile bullion price dipped a couple of dollars during the day.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market -- hit hard by the gold price's recent slide to 12-year lows -- was spooked by any downward movement in the metal price and small dips raised spectres of downward runs.</p>
<p>&quot;Golds were firm at the start but they came back on the volatile bullion price,&quot; said James Scott at Societe Generale Frankel Pollak.</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $326.20 an ounce in the London afternoon session -- down from a morning fix of $328.05.</p>
<p>Dealers said the bullion price was expected to pull back further overnight and local gold stocks were likely to be bumped at the start on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The guys are expecting the gold price to come back a bit more tonight,&quot; said another dealer who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Gold shares finished 16.3 points up at 1,008.3 points after touching a day's high of 1,022.5 points.  </p>
<p>Industrial shares rose steadily all day to finish well up but just under a new year high of 8,981 points.</p>
<p>Dealers said good demand for blue chip stocks buoyed the index and underlying sentiment remained positive.</p>
<p>Wall Street's weakness last Friday and a softer opening on Monday appeared not to concern local stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still a good sentiment out there. We seem to be on our non-correlation with Wall Street,&quot; Scott said.</p>
<p>The industrial index ended 42 points stronger at 8,979.7.</p>
<p>Overall trade was pretty active in the afternoon after a quiet morning and 574 million rands worth of shares changed hands.</p>
<p>Dealers said futures-related trade was minimal with that market also fairly quiet.</p>
<p>Near-term industrial and all-share futures contracts finished more or less steady.</p>
<p>The industrial contract was last at 8,536/45 from 8,538 settlement and the all-share was at 6,712/20 from 6,735.</p>
<p>Gold futures took more of a bump from the bullion price's dip than the cash market, ending at 708/13 from 717.  </p>
<p>The all-share index added seven points to finish at 7,431.9.</p>
<p>Mining house Gencor took a knock to finish 40 cents down at 19 rand on volume of 4.5 million shares but dealers said this had more to do with investors' tug-of-war between backing Gencor or the new London incorporated Billiton and not much to do with the drop in second quarter gold profit announced earlier.</p>
<p>Gencor announced distributable gold profit for the three months to end June of 60.65 million rand compared to 87.70 million rand in the preceding quarter.</p>
<p>Shares in South African hospital management company Netcare Ltd jumped in early trade to 214 cents from 200 cents after it announced at the weekend it had acquired a controlling interest in Clinic Holdings Limited (Clinics).</p>
<p>Netcare ended six cents up at 206 cents on volume of 2.9 million shares, while Clinics dropped 10 cents to end at 480 cents in meagre volumes of 4,000 shares.</p>
<p>Clothing company Towles, Edgar Jacobs Ltd (TEJ) shares jumped to finish at a new year high of 16 rand from 13.90 rand, ahead of an expected announcement on further acqusitions, dealers said.</p>
