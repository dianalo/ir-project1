<p>Technicians are eyeing the upper 109-00 handle in June U.S. Treasury bond futures after a pair of bullish economic reports propelled the contract to its highest price in over a month.</p>
<p>June bond futures soared to a high of 108-29 early Tuesday, for a 1-1/2-point gain, on bullish surprises in U.S. data on wages and demand for big-ticket items.</p>
<p>The first-quarter employment cost index posted a weaker than forecast 0.6 percent rise, while orders for durable goods fell 3.0 percent in March, the biggest drop since August 1996.  </p>
<p>On the bond floor, traders and analysts said the data, particularly the employment cost index, had forced many market participants to reconsider their positions. A lot of shorts were covered in the aftermath of the report, though a sizable portion have hung in, floor traders said.</p>
<p>This morning's peak in June bonds was the highest price the contract had reached since the Federal Reserve raised short-term rates by 25 basis points on March 25.</p>
<p>At midsession, June bond futures remained near the day's high at 108-24, up 1-11/32.  </p>
<p>Some technicians are now looking for the contract to revisit the March 25 high of 109-25.</p>
<p>Nike Kalivas, senior credit market analyst for Refco Inc, sees the June bond poised to test a series of former weekly lows from 109-14 to 109-26.</p>
<p>&quot;If it can close above that region on a weekly basis, bonds could be headed for a deeper rally and a possible reversal,&quot; he said. He identified 111-08, the halfway point on the climb back to the December highs from the recent low of 106-12, as a likely target if the bond rally is extended.  </p>
<p>A technician on the bond floor said he was targeting the 50-day moving average at 109-16 to 109-17 and the 200-day moving average at 109-30 as upside goals for the June bond.</p>
<p>On a pullback, futures need to stay above the former resistance level of 108-06 to keep the rally alive, he added.</p>
<p>The market is likely to continue to probe higher in the short term as the upper limits of the turnabout are explored, several traders argued.</p>
<p>However, others thought bond futures could simply consolidate for the rest of the week as they head into Friday's April employment report.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think I want to see a couple of days of trading before I decide what to do,&quot; said a floor broker who had been bearish before this morning.</p>
