<p>NYMEX electricity futures were expected to open lower Friday on talk of cheaper physical electricity prices based on the expected return to service of several generation units, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of (generation) units are coming back over the weekend and next week,&quot; said one Houston-based futures trader.</p>
<p>In early over the counter discussion, June Palo Verde (PV) was discussed near $22.25 per megawatt hour (MWh) from a Thursday NYMEX futures settlement of $22.73 per MWh.</p>
<p>Third quarter PV futures contracts were in general discussed about 25 cents per MWh under Thursday's futures settlements, sources said.</p>
<p>June California Oregon Border (COB) power was talked near $16.05-16.10 from Thursday's NYMEX June futures close at $16.44 per MWh.</p>
<p>Sources also said that COB deferreds were in general being dicussed about 15 cents under Thursday's settlements.</p>
<p>Although close to 8,000 megawatts (MW) of power generation in the U.S. West remained off line for refueling or maintenance, much of that capacity was expected to return to service through the month.</p>
<p>Short-term physical electricity prices rose Thursday as the market took notice of the unplanned outage Tuesday at a 750 megawatt unit at the Four Corners power plant in Arizona, as well as a delay in restarting a 350 MW unit at the San Juan plant in New Mexico.</p>
<p>But sources said physical power prices were discussed at considerably weaker levels early Friday.</p>
<p>Electricity futures closed down slightly Thursday in line with lower natural gas futures prices, and some profit taking in the power markets following several weeks of rising futures values.</p>
<p>The NYMEX June Henry Hub natural gas contract was trading up 0.7 cents at $2.28 per million British thermal units as of 1010 EDT Friday.</p>
<p>Weather in the Pacific Northwest was expected to turn cooler Saturday with a rain threat, while Sunday and Monday were called to be sunny and warm, averaging three to six degrees above normal through the period.</p>
<p>In the Southwest, southern California and southwest Arizona were expected to be sunny and hot with maximum temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Other areas were called to see scattered thunderstorms in the afternoons, especially in the mountain areas.</p>
