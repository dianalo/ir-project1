<p>The people of this rebel-held city, waving flags and flowers, gave Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi a hero's welcome on Sunday and lambasted Albania's elected President Sali Berisha.</p>
<p>Thousands lined the streets of the southern port, scene of much violence since the Balkan state slid into near-anarchy six weeks ago, to hail Prodi before a full-scale deployment of a multinational force in Albania later this week.</p>
<p>Prodi, at the cost of a rift with his hard-left allies, won parliament's approval last week for Italy to lead the 6,000-strong eight-nation mission which will distribute emergency food and aid across Albania.</p>
<p>Nearly 300 people have been killed and about 700 hurt in an armed uprising since the collapse of get-rich-quick investment schemes in which many Albanians lost their life savings.</p>
<p>A high-speed motorcade of heavily-armed Italian marines, Vlore police brandishing Kalashnikov rifles and journalists, overtaking each other in a mad rush to keep up with Prodi, bolted into Vlore to the delight of its cheering residents.</p>
<p>The motorcade had charged from a field beside a salt lake, 10 km (six miles) from Vlore, where Albanian and Italian military helicopter convoys deposited Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino and a few minutes later, Prodi and a few officials.</p>
<p>The landing site was chosen as a security precaution, out of rifle range from the city centre where the protests broke out in February after a local investment scheme collapsed.</p>
<p>Albania is awash with weapons after people ransacked armouries, deserted by soldiers and police during the unrest.</p>
<p>There had been fears of an anti-Italian backlash in Vlore after the sinking of a refugee ship off Italy on March 28.</p>
<p>Tirana says at least 80 people died. Many of the 34 survivors of the boat, which had left Vlore, accused the Italians of ramming the vessel, charges the navy denied.</p>
<p>Two dozen Italian marines in khaki combat gear and dozens of police could not stop a stampede of well-wishers and reporters from forming a scrum around Prodi and Fino, who greeted each other with a kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, Prodi's unmarked saloon, shielded by his marines on armoured cars mounted with large machine-guns, received a hero's welcome in Vlore, 150 km (90 miles) south of the capital Tirana.</p>
<p>Many people waved red-and-black Albanian flags and purple flowers and held banners reading &quot;Welcome Mr Prodi&quot; and &quot;We Want Our Money Back&quot;.</p>
<p>Several were written in Italian and one read: &quot;Down with Berisha mafia&quot;, a reference to the president, a northerner blamed by many Albanians for the collapse of the investment schemes in Europe's poorest country.</p>
<p>Rebel-held town councils, called &quot;national salvation committees&quot;, took control of most of the south, including Vlore, more than a month ago.</p>
<p>At least 10,000 people gathered outside a university building where Prodi held talks with Fino.</p>
<p>The crowd sang out &quot;Prodi&quot; and clapped, and chanted &quot;Berisha&quot; pointing thumbs down.</p>
<p>At a news conference in a classroom daubed with graffiti in the university building, the head of Vlore's rebel town council, Medin Xhelili, piled the blame on Berisha for the country's woes.</p>
<p>&quot;We are the product of the bad government of the Democratic Party and Berisha,&quot; Xhelili said, flanked by Prodi.</p>
<p>The Italian prime minister said he was determined not to get involved in domestic Albanian politics.</p>
<p>Prodi expressed his condolences to Fino over the sinking of the refugee ship and called for a minute's silence.</p>
<p>Xhelili held aloft an Italian flag with Prodi in order to show Vlore's welcome of the Italian presence in the city.</p>
