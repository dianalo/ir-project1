<title>GERMANY: German shares bow to EMU woe, seek Wall Street cue.</title>
<headline>German shares bow to EMU woe, seek Wall Street cue.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-06-09</dateline>

<p>German shares are heading into an uncertain week after a tumultuous start, dealers said on Monday.</p>
<p>A firm rally in early trade reversed abruptly in the bourse session as worries about monetary union escalated, sending the blue chip DAX index down to close almost 70 points below its intraday highs.</p>
<p>&quot;There were so many negative headlines -- about EMU, about the (German) coalition -- and so many rumours that they had to take their toll,&quot; said Josh Waiblinger, assistant vice president of equities at BHF Bank.  </p>
<p>The IBIS DAX index was down 29.75 points at 3,670.78 points at 1312 GMT, just ahead of the DAX's early afternoon bourse close level of 3,667.43.</p>
<p>In the early morning, a rally on Wall Street on Friday, amid relief at tame jobs data, had propelled the IBIS DAX to an alltime high of 3,9734.05 points.</p>
<p>The reversal came after the new French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said he wanted to delay an agreement on the stability pact designed to ensure budgetary discipline under monetary union, triggering widespread market worries that the euro project will be derailed.  </p>
<p>That came on top of German Finance Minister Theo Waigel's dogged insistence that Maastricht budget goals must be reached precisely -- a goal most market participants now believe German will be extremely hard pushed to meet.</p>
<p>&quot;This all poses the question - how is the euro going to be achieved?,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing is sure, if people really start to worry about this, there will be chaos in the markets,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Thomas Meyer, senior economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, said however that markets were overreacting.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the French are playing for time,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It would have been far more surprising if a new French government, just a week old and at its very first internationally significant meeting, were to simply have followed in the footsteps of their predecessors.&quot;</p>
<p>The turmoil undermined the dollar against the mark, always bad news for German exporters.</p>
<p>Dollar-sensitive shares took the brunt of the selling pressure, with BMW down 45.70 marks at 1,374.30 while Hoechst AG fell 1.43 marks,k or more than two percent, to 69.41 marks.</p>
<p>But dealers said the pressure was mainly driven by futures.  </p>
<p>Since cash market turnover was relatively low, a period of volatility was seen as likely, with Wall Street likely to provide key direction for German shares in the first half of the week.</p>
<p>Some dealers said today's sell-off was insignificant and that the lost ground could be quickly regained.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing has changed fundamentally,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;To me it seems people just got nervous about the highs and took the chance to get out.&quot;</p>
