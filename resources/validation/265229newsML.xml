<headline>US jet fuel markets ignore Buckeye shutdown.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>New York Harbor jet fuel markets ignored news of a bomb scare that shut the Buckeye Pipeline's New York City section.</p>
<p>Activity remained subdued there, with no confirmed deals done early Wednesday, traders said. Differentials for spot delivery of aviation-grade jet fuel in New York Harbor barge markets sat unchanged, with offers at 2.00 cents over the NYMEX print.</p>
<p>A package found near the line on Staten Island was being removed, according to Buckeye, and the line would almost surely be reopened before the end of Wednesday.</p>
<p>The section of the line supplies, among other products, jet fuel to New York City's two airports.</p>
<p>&quot;There's plenty of fuel at the airports,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Market players said unless the pipeline was damaged or shut for an extended period, little bullish price effect would be felt.</p>
<p>&quot;If anything, the shutdown would do just the opposite and depress the  barrels because there's no place to take them,&quot; the trader said. People who purchased jet fuel barrels would be forced to put them in storage or find alternate means of moving them to the airports, incurring additional costs.</p>
<p>That scenario does not yet appear to have occurred.</p>
<p>Buckeye, owned by Buckeye Partners LP, operates a network of refined oil pipelines that starts in the New York City area and extends north and west through upstate New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio to touch the eastern edge of the U.S. midcontinent</p>
