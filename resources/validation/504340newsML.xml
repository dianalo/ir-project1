<title>PHILIPPINES: Philippine property stocks index slumps 1.43 pct.</title>
<headline>Philippine property stocks index slumps 1.43 pct.</headline>

<p>Philippine property stocks retreated in late trade on Friday due to persistent fears of a real estate sector crisis due to a glut, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It seemed like it will take a while before investors realise that we are not going the way of Thailand,&quot; said Allan Araullo, chief trader at Regina Capital Development Corp.</p>
<p>The Philippine property stocks index dropped 1.43 percent to 1,405.32 points.  </p>
<p>Despite the fall of the property stocks index, the main index sustained its upward momentum due to the rise of the banking, commercial-industrial, and mining sectors.</p>
<p>The biggest losers were Fil-Estate Land Inc, down 50 centavos to 8.80 pesos, Robinsons Land Corp B, down 15 centavos to 4.10 pesos, Megaworld Properties and Holdings Inc, down 40 centavos to 4.10 pesos and Ayala Land Inc B, down 50 centavos to 25 pesos.</p>
<p>Property issues, along with banking stocks, lifted the market in a technical rally on Thursday after seven-straight sessions of losses.</p>
<p>Philippine property issues had been hit hard in the past days due to rumours the industry might suffer the same fate that befell Thailand's property and banking sectors because of a reported glut that investors fear could trigger a crash in prices.</p>
<p>A property oversupply in Thailand had hit Thai banks and finance firms because of their huge loans to real estate firms.</p>
<p>&quot;...This concern is exaggerated. Should there be an oversupply it will be concentrated in certain areas of the real estate sector only, specifically on the high-end,&quot; said Jasmine Juanico, analyst at Anscor Hagedorn Securities in an advisory to clients.</p>
<p>Juanico said Thailand's real estate industry experienced a price boom for at least a decade before it hit a bust. &quot;The bust therefore is almost expected and called for,&quot; she said. The Philippiune property sector on the other hand has been through such phase for a much shorter period of time, she added.</p>
<p>She also said that the exposure of Philippine banks in the local property sector is less than 10 percent of their total loan portfolio as against 30 to 40 percent in Thailand.</p>
