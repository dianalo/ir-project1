<p>One of the most reviled figures of Italy's graft scandals, former health minister Francesco De Lorenzo, has found unpaid work helping drug addicts, newspapers reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said De Lorenzo, a talented doctor in his own right, told judges at one of his trials in Naples on Tuesday that he had begun coordinating an international research project into how viral hepatitis affects addicts.</p>
<p>La Stampa newspaper quoted him as saying that the European Union had been asked for a 700 million lire ($460,000) grant for the project, organised through a drug addiction centre in central Italy run by a Roman Catholic priest, Pierino Gelmini.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the European Community will grant us the funds,&quot; De Lorenzo said. &quot;We expect an answer by the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>De Lorenzo, who was a member of the now defunct Liberal Party, was health minister from 1989 to 1993.</p>
<p>He became the target of much of the popular Italian outrage over extensive graft in politics after investigators accused him of accepting huge bribes from pharmaceutical companies to ensure that the price of drugs set by the ministry remained high.</p>
<p>De Lorenzo faces 92 separate corruption charges. He denies that he enriched himself from the alleged scams.</p>
<p>The former minister said he had been working unpaid on the research project since March after Gelmini approached him.</p>
<p>&quot;I am Father Pierino Gelmini's ambassador in Europe,&quot; De Lorenzo said. &quot;Thanks to a friend I have rediscovered a bit of interest in life.&quot;</p>
<p>De Lorenzo, who spent seven months in pre-trial custody in a Naples jail in 1994, said scientists from several countries including Britain and Sweden were working with him on the project.</p>
