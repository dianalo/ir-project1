<p>Oil traders are demanding tougher, U.S.-style policing of Europe's main energy market after a bad-tempered duel between two top dealing houses triggered a sharp slowdown in business.</p>
<p>Traders across the continent said in telephone interviews London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) should consider levying big spot fines on any players involved in trying to &quot;squeeze&quot; the market to protect orderly trade in a vital fuel that heats European households in winter.</p>
<p>The get-tough calls are a response to a rare public showdown between two big trading houses long known as rivals for supremacy in the trade in gas oil, a range of products including heating oil and low suphur diesel.</p>
<p>&quot;It's two of the big boys going head to head -- a power play with a lot of big egos involved,&quot; said Jim Ritterbusch of Sweeney Oil in Chicago of the large positions involved in the November confrontation.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't get away with that kind of thing on NYMEX. As a result of (NYMEX discipline) we haven't seen things like that for a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>Some traders point admiringly to NYMEX -- the New York Mercantile Exchange -- where players who wield large positions found to be disrupting the market may be subject to spot fines of $1 million followed by arbitration in which they are liable to further fines.</p>
<p>Traders say a culture change at the IPE in favour of punitive fines would boost the market's volume and help promote the IPE into the U.S.-dominated first division of the world's futures markets. Some say publication of any fine would be an added deterrent.</p>
<p>&quot;There might be a role for late performance penalties, subject to an appeal in exceptional circumstances,&quot; said Chris Cook, a compliance consultant on futures and options who has done work with the IPE.</p>
<p>The duel between Monte Carlo-based AIC  and a Swiss unit of U.S.-based Cargill involves the bulk of a record-high 865,100- tonne delivery due between November 16-30 on the Rotterdam region barge market.</p>
<p>Traders say Cargill bought heavily in the contract, hoping to turn a profit by betting in effect that AIC, which had a corresponding seller's &quot;short&quot; position, would not be able to deliver into its commitments.</p>
<p>Ironically, all the barges involved in the delivery were tied up trying to shift the $200 million worth of product around the Rotterdam region while German end-users struggled with historically low winter stocks.</p>
<p>AIC says Cargill was slow in taking delivery. Cargill denied wrongdoing and suggested much of the responsibility lay with AIC.</p>
<p>The play jolted the premiums that govern pricing for European end-users and paralysed much of the Rotterdam barge trade used for physical delivery during the winter season, curbing liquidity, distorting supply patterns and blunting the IPE's price discovery function.</p>
<p>The showdown was the latest in a series of increasingly bitter duels in gas oil futures that have driven other companies from the market complaining that it has become &quot;a battle of the giants&quot;.</p>
<p>The issue is now in the hands of the IPE which is expected to arbitrate. But traders who want the IPE to wield a big stick say that in the past IPE arbitration and punishment has been secretive amd slow and that to be effective punishment must be swift, public and very costly.</p>
<p>While many traders favour fines they disagree on whether the contract needs tightening. The IPE constantly reviews and adjusts the contract but some want greater clarity in the smallest details of delivery requirements.</p>
<p>A minority of traders say more discipline will not work and market turbulence is a normal part of the high-stakes culture of physical trader.</p>
<p>&quot;If someone wants to take a position to take advantage of whatever rules there are, then they will find a way of doing it,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just two big boys -- consenting adults -- playing games and they know they can get caught with their trousers down,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>IPE chief executive Lynton Jones last month welcomed an agreement by global commodity regulators to strengthen supervision in commodity markets but added that markets should not become over-regulated.</p>
<p>&quot;The tighter the contract the less likely it is that people will test it,&quot; said Ritterbusch. &quot;If there are any loopholes or soft spots someone's going to try to slip through.&quot;</p>
<p>An analyst with wide experience of the contract disagreed, saying, &quot;The tighter a contract is, the easier it is to manipulate. Some people who are calling for a tighter contract may have something to gain out of it. There is a lot of axe-grinding going on.&quot;</p>
