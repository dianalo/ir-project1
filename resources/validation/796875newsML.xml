<title>SWEDEN: New threats as police dismiss Stockholm bomb claim.</title>
<headline>New threats as police dismiss Stockholm bomb claim.</headline>
<dateline>STOCKHOLM 1997-08-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Police dismissed on Wednesday a claim by a group calling itself &quot;We Who Built Sweden&quot; that it started a string of fires in Stockholm and set off a bomb to sabotage the city's bid to stage the 2004 Olympics.</p>
<p>But Swedish media received two more communications,  apparently from the same group, threatening violence against athletes if Stockholm was chosen to host the 2004 Games.</p>
<p>Sweden's national news agency TT, which received the first claim by letter on Monday, was sent a fax on Wednesday evening and a newspaper in western Sweden, the Gothenburg Post, received a similar letter by mail. Police were investigating both items.</p>
<p>Stockholm police commissioner Gunno Gunnmo said analysis of the first letter showed &quot;no evidence to support the suggestion that the person or persons behind the letter should be involved in the incidents.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The person or persons have simply taken advantage of incidents that have already occurred,&quot; Gunnmo said.</p>
<p>In the letter, We Who Built Sweden said it was responsible for eight fires at sports venues in the Swedish capital and a bomb explosion last Friday at a stadium built for the 1912 Stockholm Olympics.</p>
<p>The group threatened to target athletes and the public if Stockholm was awarded the 2004 Olympics.</p>
<p>Police released no details of their analysis of the letter but police spokesman Claes Cassel said &quot;the picture of the letter as a whole&quot; led them to conclude it was a hoax.</p>
<p>TT said it received the second threat via its fax machine after the police statement dismissing the group's claim.</p>
<p>&quot;If Stockholm gets the Olympic Games in 2004 poison arrows will be shot with blowpipes and air pistols at both athletes and certain people of high ranking,&quot; the typed fax said.</p>
<p>TT said the fax had no telephone or contact number, but was signed with the initials V.S.B.S. used by We Who Built Sweden.</p>
<p>Cassel told TT that the Gothenburg Post received a letter signed &quot;V.S.B.S. - commando Gothenburg&quot; and threatening further violence if Stockholm won the right to stage the 2004 Olympics.</p>
<p>Four other cities -- Athens, Buenos Aires, Cape Town and Rome -- are bidding for the 2004 Olympics. The decision will be made on September 5.</p>
