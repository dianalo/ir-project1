<p>Members of a Congressional panel Tuesday blasted the Defence Department's handling of the Gulf War illness, citing a recent report that found the Pentagon was making little progress in finding the cause and less in finding a treatment.</p>
<p>Several Republican and Democratic members of the House Committee on Government Reform's human resources subcommittee said that the Defence Department and Veteran's Administration should consider turning over the research to an independent body.</p>
<p>Subcommittee chairman Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, said military officials have shown &quot;arrogance and myopia,&quot; and a &quot;desire to jump to convenient conclusions.&quot;</p>
<p>He said his panel in the next few weeks would consider &quot;how the Gulf War research agenda might be more effectively controlled by an independent body veterans and others can trust.&quot;</p>
<p>The General Accounting Office in a report commissioned by the panel found many faults with the research into the mysterious syndrome and treatment effort so far.</p>
<p>In particular, it said there was not adequate scientific evidence to back up the Pentagon's assertion that many of the mysterious symptoms were due in large part to stress.</p>
<p>And the report said defence authorities had not given enough consideration to several theories about possible causes, including parasites, pesticides, and in particular combinations of chemicals and toxins that could be more dangerous in combination than they are one at a time.</p>
<p>Donna Heivilin, a senior GAO official on national security issues, testified that the military authorities had tried to diagnose veterans and care for their problems but had not &quot;systematically attempted to determine whether ill Gulf War veterans are any better or worse today than when they were first examined.&quot;</p>
<p>The GAO report was officially released Tuesday but a draft had been leaked to the New York Times earlier this month. Defence Secretary William Cohen said then, &quot;We think we are making a very strong, good faith effort to get to the bottom of it.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that he too had criticised aspects of the Defence Department's investigation.</p>
