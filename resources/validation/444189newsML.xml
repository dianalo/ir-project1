<p>The Thai bourse took a tumble on Friday after government measures aimed at propping up the ailing finance and property sectors lost their initial glow and Wall Street declined overnight, brokers and analysts said.</p>
<p>The market, which plunged to a near five-year low last week, reversed this week's upward trend and dropped 3.04 percent to 694.91 as late selling erased all the gains made since Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not over yet,&quot; said Graham Catterwell, head of equities at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. &quot;The market was desperately looking for good news. But then it sobered up and realised there's a good way to go yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers said investors sold finance and bank shares on Friday as sentiment was also dampened by heavy declines on Wall Street. The Dow index tumbled more than 160 points on Thursday.</p>
<p>Analysts and brokers said investors in Thailand were beginning to question how much the government's new measures could really help the ailing finance and property sectors.</p>
<p>Authorities last week launched a series of new measures to remedy a liquidity crunch, poor asset quality and bad loan problems.</p>
<p>They ordered banks and finance companies to boost provisions for sub-standard assets and told 10 weakened finance companies to boost their capital.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate that banks and finance companies have sunk about 800 billion baht ($31 billion) in loans into troubled property firms. A large portion of them are suspected to be bad loans, they said.</p>
<p>The government also approved the launch of 100 billion baht in zero coupon bonds to raise funds to help property firms.</p>
<p>&quot;This news ... was a good catalyst to trigger a short-term market rally,&quot; said one analyst. &quot;But it's not the final solution. They have to deal with some fundamental problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers and analysts said some of the selling was due to uncertainty over how the market would react on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no positive news in the market to persuade investors to hold stocks during the weekend,&quot; said Bunsom Kesapradist, analyst at Asia Credit.</p>
<p>Some analysts said investors could also be wary after Thailand's security watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday said it was investigating transactions made by executives of the nation's top finance firm, Finance One Plc, for possible insider trading.</p>
<p>The announcement came shortly before Finance One and middle-sized Thai Danu Bank signed a memorandum of understanding on Friday agreeing to merge.</p>
<p>Analysts said the SEC probe would not affect the merger plan which had been welcomed by authorities.</p>
<p>A Thai police statement that warrants had been issued for the arrest of Saudi Arabian tycoon Adnan Khashoggi and four officials of the ailing Bangkok Bank of Commerce on charges of trying to defraud the bank had no impact on the market, analysts said.</p>
<p>The baht was not affected by Friday's developments. It firmed against the dollar in quiet dealings to 25.966/25.969 late from 25.972/25.975 earlier on.</p>
<p>Dealers said sentiment improved in the baht as investors welcomed the efforts bolster the finance sector.</p>
