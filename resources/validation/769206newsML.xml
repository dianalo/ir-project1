<p>A leading Philippine presidential candidate said on Thursday allegations linking her to a suspected drug lord were part of a military plot to control political power in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;They concocted a plot that would have done the devil proud,&quot; opposition senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo said after a suspect, now in army custody, named 46 people including four senators and five police generals, as supposed protectors of a drugs ring.</p>
<p>The three other senators on the list of supposed protectors of drug traffickers also issued denials. They included Arroyo's vice presidential running mate, Senator Vicente Sotto.</p>
<p>The list, including 15 other police officers and a judge, was provided to military interrogators by provincial businessman Florencio Parena, who surrendered last week after police named him as a suspected trafficker.</p>
<p>The illegal drugs trade - estimated to earn 250 billion pesos ($8.6 billion) a year, or more than half the size of the national budget - has become one of the black spots in President Fidel Ramos's administration, clouding Ramos's success in turning a once bankrupt economy around.</p>
<p>Arroyo said in a statement efforts to link her name to drugs traffickers were intended to sabotage her candidacy in the 1998 presidential elections to choose a successor to Ramos.</p>
<p>&quot;A clique in the military is sowing fear and mayhem,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She said this was part of a &quot;massive plot...to install another general in the seat of power as was done in countries where an electoral game of the generals goes non-stop.&quot;</p>
<p>She did not name the general.</p>
<p>Defence Secretary and ex-general Renato de Villa is the only military man among a dozen politicians who have annnounced their bid to run for president in the May 1998 elections.</p>
<p>De Villa, a prodigy of Ramos, who is also a former army general, denied any involvement. &quot;I have never authorised and will never authorise any smear campaign in the pursuit of my declared political objective,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ramos, who is constitutionally barred from running for a second term, told reporters no one in his government would stoop to &quot;dirty tricks&quot; to ensure the victory of the administration candidate in the 1998 elections.</p>
<p>Arroyo, daughter of a former president, has been running neck-and-neck with Vice-President Joseph Estrada, also of the opposition, in opinion polls among presidential candidates.</p>
<p>De Villa and other administration aspirants have languished at the bottom of the surveys.</p>
<p>Publication of the list added a new twist to a tangled political drama that began with the murder in June of a Manila journalist who had accused police of protecting drug syndicates.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, a judge ordered Manila mayor Alfredo Lim to stop branding the homes of suspected drug pushers with &quot;Get out&quot; signs after human rights lawyers said Lim was behaving like Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p>Judge Librado Correa directed Lim to suspend his anti-drugs campaign for 20 days so the court could study the petition by a lawyers group which wants the campaign permanently banned.</p>
<p>The group likened Lim's methods to Hitler's campaign of branding the homes of Jews with the Star of David.</p>
