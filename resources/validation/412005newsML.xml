<p>North Korea's vice defence minister died of illness on Thursday, North Korean state media reported, just days after the demise of the defence minister and other leadership upheavals.</p>
<p>Analysts said the death of Kim Kwang-jin, aged 69, would force the pace of transition to a new generation of commanders of the 1.1 million-strong People's Armed Forces, still widely feared as the greatest threat to peace in Asia.</p>
<p>It was the latest in a series of deaths among the military's revolutionary old guard, seen as staunch supporters of the country's uncrowned leader Kim Jong-il.</p>
<p>Kim Kwang-jin, first vice-minister of the armed forces and a member of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party, died of &quot;incurable disease&quot;, the Korean Central News Agency reported on Friday.</p>
<p>A state funeral is to take place on Saturday.</p>
<p>Kim's superior, Choe Kwang, died of a heart attack just a week ago, North Korean official media announced.</p>
<p>Thus, in quick succession, North Korea has lost two of the most powerful figures in a military hierarchy that has a key role to play in cementing the hold on power of Kim Jong-il, son of &quot;Great Leader&quot; Kim Il-sung, who died in 1994.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, North Korea's prime minister was replaced -- apparently for health reasons -- and chief ideologue Hwang Jang-yop defected to South Korea's mission in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;For the armed forces, the death of the two top officials is a serious blow,&quot; said Noriyuki Suzuki, North Korean analyst at Japan's Radiopress news agency.</p>
<p>&quot;This would inevitably force Kim Jong-il to speed up the process of generational change in the armed forces leadership.&quot;</p>
<p>Kim Jong-il is preparing to inherit the vacant titles of state president and general secretary of the Workers' Party.</p>
<p>Many North Korea watchers believe he will complete the socialist world's first dynastic succession after the third anniversary of his father's death in July.</p>
<p>Michael Breen, a Seoul-based consultant on North Korea, said that Kim, having used the old guard to secure his grip on power, has now found them blocking his tentative moves to take the country out of hostile isolation and establish dialogue with the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;One explanation of why things are moving so slowly in North Korea is because of problems retiring the old generation,&quot; Breen said.</p>
<p>South Korea's Unification Ministry said Kim Kwang-jin had been Kim Jong-il's most loyal military supporter. A statement said he apparently died of diabetes and liver disease.</p>
<p>&quot;At first sight the death of the No. 2 man in the North Korean armed forces might look very suspicious, coming only a week after the death of the No. 1,&quot; said Suzuki.</p>
<p>&quot;But Kim Kwang-jin was seldom seen since last year and it looks as though his illness was genuine. His whereabouts were not known for much of last year and he was last reported to have taken part in a rally on January 3.&quot;</p>
<p>The defection of Hwang Jang-yop dramatically revealed wavering loyalty at the top echelons to a hardline communist creed that has led to near-famine and economic ruin.</p>
<p>Hwang is still holed up at Seoul's consular office in Beijing after arriving there with an aide on February 12.</p>
<p>South Korean efforts to persuade China to allow Hwang safe passage to Seoul have so far yielded no progress.</p>
