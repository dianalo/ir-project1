<p>A man previously charged in a scheme to help graduate school applicants cheat on admissions exams has now been accused of helping immigrants to fraudulently obtain Canadian citizenship, prosecutors said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Po Chieng Ma, 45, of Arcadia, Calif., had been arrested in October under the name of George Kobayashi for helping applicants cheat on the Graduate Record Exam and Graduate Management Admissions tests by encoding answers on pencils.</p>
<p>The new complaint, filed in Manhattan federal court, charges that when federal agents searched Ma's California and New York offices in connection with the test cheating scheme, they also found documents relating to his immigration business.</p>
<p>Prosecutors alleged that Ma advised a client that he could fraudulently obtain Canadian citizenship by falsely claiming to have been a resident of Canada for three years. Under provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a Canadian citizen can live and work in the United States.</p>
<p>The complaint also charged that Ma promised to provide the client with a false address in Canada to get the citizenship. Ma allegedly charged $3,000 for his aid in obtaining necessary documents.</p>
