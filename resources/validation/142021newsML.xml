<headline>NZ Labour's Cullen calls for release of papers.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-10-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Labour Party deputy leader and finance spokesperson Michael Cullen on Thursday called for the release of all departmental papers prepared for an incoming government, saying they could be highly relevant to coalition negotiations.</p>
<p>Cullen said he had heard &quot;on the grapevine&quot; the Treasury was now forecasting significantly different numbers from those included its September pre-election economic and fiscal update (PREFU).  </p>
<p>&quot;If that is so, it raises questions about the integrity and credibility of that update which was not meant to be a rosy scenario and aid to the re-election of a National government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Cullen said confidential briefings from officials were not good enough, as the facts revealed in those were not in the public arena.</p>
<p>&quot;This means that those who are not party to negotiations will not be in full possession of the relevant information.  </p>
<p>Finance Minister Bill Birch said the Crown's financial statements for the first quarter of the financial year, to be released publicly on November 1, contained no surprises and were consistent with the forecasts published in the PREFU.</p>
<p>Birch said Cullen had the opportunity to be fully informed of the facts.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than speculating about what he's heard 'on the grapevine' why doesn't Dr Cullen take up the offer of a briefing from Treasury for the Labour Party?,&quot; he asked, adding that New Zealand First, Act and the Alliance had already had independent private briefings from Treasury.  </p>
