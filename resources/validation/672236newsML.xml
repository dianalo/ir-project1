<headline>UK shares claw back losses, FTSE ends slighly off.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain's FTSE 100 share index clawed back most of its early losses on Thursday but failed to clamber into positive territory, suffering its fourth fall in a row with a modest drop of 3.3 points to 4,653.7.</p>
<p>A firmer Dow and a modest recovery in the futures market, which had a volatile day ahead of Friday's expiry of June contracts, helped drag the FTSE up from its morning nadir.</p>
<p>But growing concern that another UK interest rate rise is looming and continued nervousness ahead of the new Labour government's July 2 budget capped FTSE's gains, dealers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's been too much gloom about interest rates and the Budget to allow the market to make progress,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;It was another fairly miserable morning although it has been a bit perkier this afternoon.&quot;</p>
<p>The market had an early shock when provisional data showed an annual increase of 11.1 percent in Britain's M4 money supply in May, ahead of the 10 percent rise expected by analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the monetary side of a very strong economy and maybe now on the verge of overheating and needs controlling action to be taken,&quot; said Richard Jeffrey, group economist at Charterhouse Tilney.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think we should see a half-point increase in base rates at the next meeting and I don't think that can be the end of the tightening in monetary policy this year.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said expectations that Britain's July 2 Budget would cut the tax credit which large institutional investors like pension funds can claim on dividend payments, were continuing to weigh on the market.</p>
<p>A choppy futures market was expected to inject extra volatility into the FTSE until June index futures and options expire between 0900 and 0930 GMT on Friday. &quot;The futures will be making things pretty rough,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>The expiry is expected to be more torrid than usual, dealers said, as it will see the unwinding of London's biggest-ever single options trade, a billion-pound position set up in November.</p>
<p>&quot;It is going to be one of the biggest expirations we have ever had,&quot; one derivatives trader said. &quot;People are getting very nervous of the market and volatility has already skewed up.&quot;</p>
<p>The FTSE has fallen more than 125 points since reaching a record close last Friday. Volume on SEAQ was one billion by 1610 GMT, but this was skewed by extremely heavy trade in Grand Metropolitan Plc.  </p>
<p>Grand Met shares closed 17-1/2p higher at 603-1/2 after a late surge with volume in excess of 250 million. Dealers said France's LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton had been buying more shares in the company.</p>
<p>LVMH opposes Grand Met's planned merger with Guinness Plc , but LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault has said he has no intention of making a full bid for Grand Met, leaving analysts and dealers in London puzzled about his motives.</p>
<p>Lloyds TSB Group Plc was another strong performer, up 16p to 621-1/2 after analysts at Merrill Lynch, ABN AMRO Hoare Govett and SBC Warburg upgraded their earnings estimates.  </p>
<p>B.A.T Industries Plc ended 13-1/2p firmer at 581-1/2, boosted by hopes of a settlement for tobacco litigation in the U.S.</p>
<p>RJB Mining Plc dropped 14p to 347-1/2 after company broker BZW cut its 1997 profit forecast for the coal mining group.</p>
<p>Associated British Foods Plc finished 20-1/2p lower at 543-1/2, hit by profit taking after recent sharp gains, dealers said.</p>
