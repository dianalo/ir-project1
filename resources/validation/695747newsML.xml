<p>The size of the planned 1998 municipal eurobond issue by the central Polish city of Lodz could exceed the town's 1996 29-million-zloty issue by about three times, Lodz's president said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The size of the issue will depend on the needs of the planned investment in the city's infrastructure. We estimate that will have to be about three times larger than the last municipal bond issue,&quot; Marek Czekalski told a news conference.</p>
<p>Czekalski, speaking after Standard &amp; Poor's assigned it BBB minus long-term foreign and local currency issuer credit ratings, said the issue planned for the start or middle of next year would go toward the launching of a fast tram line.</p>
<p>&quot;The BBB- rating, the same as Poland's, is a very good appraisal of the city, the maximum we could receive taking into consideration the fact that municipalities and towns... can at most receive a rating even with their country,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Przemyslaw Wnuk, head of the economic department at Lodz's investment department, told the conference that the bond could be denominated in dollars, marks or yen with possible interest at about seven percent and maturity of seven and 21 years.</p>
<p>The issue would be the first eurobond issued by a Polish city. -- Janusz Brzeszczynski +48 22 653 9700</p>
