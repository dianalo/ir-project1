<p>A federal judge Thursday urged jurors to try again to reach a decision on whether the ABC television network should be ordered to pay punitive damages to the Food Lion Inc. supermarket chain.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Carlton Tilley assembled the jurors and repeated his original instructions to them. He said the panel had a duty to fairly weigh the evidence and try to reach agreement on the punitive damages phase of the trial.</p>
<p>The jurors, in their third straight day of deliberations, resumed their discussions at 9:50 a.m. EST.</p>
<p>The jury is trying to decide whether ABC, a Walt Disney Co. unit, and four of its producers should be ordered to pay punitive damages for a 1992 undercover report that said Food Lion sold spoiled meat and unsafe repackaged foods.</p>
<p>The Salisbury, N.C.-based company says its stock price and grocery store sales plunged after ABC's &quot;PrimeTime Live&quot; show broadcast the story based on video obtained by two ABC journalists who wore hidden cameras while briefly working for Food Lion.</p>
<p>Last month, the jury found ABC liable for fraud and ordered the network to pay actual damages of $1,400.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Food Lion urged jurors to send a stern message to media organisations trying to win viewers with hidden camera reports by ordering ABC to pay hefty punitive damages.</p>
<p>The grocery store chain has not challenged the truth of the broadcast in the trial, but sued ABC and its producers for fraud, trespassing and breach of duty in preparing the report.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the network defended the practice of undercover reporting as a way to bring valuable information to the public.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the 12-member jury sent a second note of the day to the judge saying the panel was deadlocked. The note said the jury reached a stalemate because one juror, a woman, was determined not to work with the rest of the panel.</p>
<p>A decision to order punitive damages must be unanimous.</p>
<p>The case is being closely watched by U.S. media organisations as a litmus test of whether companies can sue for investigative reports. Instead of pursuing a libel claim against ABC, Food Lion attacked the way the story was obtained.</p>
<p>Food Lion attorneys said punitive damages should be large enough to stop news organisations from pursuing future investigative reports that break the law in the process.</p>
<p>Although Food Lion did not request a specific amount in punitive damages, it suggested jurors consider taking away Capital Cities/ABC's profits for the number of days that the ABC undercover investigation lasted.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the grocery chain told jurors that, with annual profits of $1.3 billion, ABC last year made a daily profit of about $3.5 million. That amount multiplied by the 60-day investigation would total some $210 million, the lawyers said.</p>
<p>The grocery store chain also suggested that the two executive producers of the programme, Ira Rosen and Richard Kaplan, each be ordered to pay $50,000 in punitive damages. Food Lion also urged jurors to order the two undercover journalists -- Lynne Dale and Susan Barnett --to pay an amount proportionate to their salaries.</p>
<p>Food Lion is a unit of Belgian retailer Ets Delhaize Freres et Cie &quot;LE LION' SA and had 1996 sales of $9 billion.</p>
