<title>USA: Californians warned of health risks from floodwater.</title>

<p>Californians returning to flood-damaged homes on Tuesday were warned of health risks from dead animals and raw sewage as losses from devastating floods were set to top $1 billion.</p>
<p>While floodwaters were receding in some areas, allowing evacuees to return home, levee breaks in central California forced new evacuations. Local officials urged hundreds of people to evacuate after a levee broke along the San Joaquin river near Manteca, 60 miles (100 km) southeast of San Francisco, the state Office of Emergency Services said.</p>
<p>Vast areas of farmland and hundreds of homes remained under water in northern and central California and officials were battling to shore up fragile levees. Flood warnings remained in effect for three rivers.</p>
<p>The California Department of Health Services urged residents to take precautions to avoid potential health problems when returning to flooded homes.</p>
<p>&quot;Failure to remove contaminated materials and to reduce moisture and humidity can present long-term health risks,&quot; the department said. &quot;Standing water and wet materials are a breeding ground for microorganisms that can cause disease...&quot;</p>
<p>Raw sewage is flowing into several rivers where sewage plants were overwhelmed by the flood. Receding floodwater in some areas revealed carcasses of dead cattle. Pesticide contamination is also a concern.</p>
<p>Officials recommended that flood victims should discard any food that might have come into contact with floodwater and wear rubber boots and waterproof gloves during cleanup if there had been a backflow of sewage in their house.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton has declared a major disaster in parts of California, Nevada and Idaho due to floods, the result of powerful storms that hit the West in the last 10 days. Oregon and Washington also suffered widespread damage from floods and landslides that have killed at least 20 people in the region, including six in California.</p>
<p>California said on Monday that initial flood damage estimates from nine counties and one city -- less than a quarter of the 42 counties where the state has declared a state of emergency -- totalled $775 million.</p>
<p>Richard Andrews, director of the state Office of Emergency Services, said on Monday that total flood losses would be &quot;in the hundreds of millions of dollars, if not over $1 billion.&quot;</p>
<p>When hard-hit counties were added in, other officials said the figure could rival the $1.8 billion in losses caused by 1995 floods, the worst in the state's history. State agriculture officials say no figures are yet available for losses to the state's $22 billion farm industry.</p>
<p>High water levels on the San Joaquin River that runs through California's central valley and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River delta were causing state officials the most concern on Tuesday. Unusually high tides were adding to pressure on levees on the delta, the state Office of Emergency Services said.</p>
<p>A desperate battle was being fought near the small town of Meridian, 50 miles (80 km) north of Sacramento, where 200 people worked around the clock to build an earth wall to protect the town's 200 homes after a levee broke.</p>
