<p>The market seems to have read too much into a single sentence from Bernie Fraser's Thursday speech, the quote that everyone will remember as saying there was little need for a monetary easing.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it is a case of not reading enough, because Fraser said more than that, and his comments taken all together do not seem to justify the bearishness of the bill strip, which now shows no risk of any further rate cuts.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, the December bill futures stood at 93.07, implying 6.97 percent on 90-day money in December, barely different from the overnight cash rate of 7.00 percent.</p>
<p>March is 93.00, exactly 7.00 percent.</p>
<p>Fraser's golden quote -- and it was an unusually direct one -- was: &quot;At face value, they (the official forecasts) suggest little need for early monetary policy action.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, if that doesn't say &quot;sell&quot;, then nothing does.</p>
<p>But there are two very important qualifications in that sentence:</p>
<p>--He is only commenting on &quot;early&quot; monetary action; and</p>
<p>--Starting with the words &quot;at face value&quot;, Fraser is telling us right from the beginning that there is a little more to think about than the forecasts as they stand.</p>
<p>The sentences that follow end up with a slight emphasis on downside monetary risk, not upside risk.</p>
<p>He continues: &quot;Like all forecasts, however, they are subject to many risks -- in both directions.&quot;</p>
<p>At this point he has not changed the net outlook for policy, because he emphasises that errors can be in both directions.</p>
<p>The next sentence adds nothing: &quot;Policymakers understand these risks, which is why policy remains under constant review.&quot;</p>
<p>Then, finally: &quot;In their monitoring of economic developments, policymakers will be alert for any early signs that business investment or wages growth or unemployment, for example, might be diverging significantly from the current forecasts.&quot;</p>
<p>Note that he cites three sources of risk.</p>
<p>But only one of them, wages, carries an upside risk for monetary policy, and then only ambiguously, since low wages growth might easily persuade the bank that cash rates can fall a notch.</p>
<p>The other two issues that concern him, investment and unemployment, are unambiguous downside risks. No one is expecting excessive investment or precipitously falling unemployment to prompt a tightening.</p>
<p>Summarising then, his coments mean that the forecasts tell the bank to do nothing for the moment, but there are risks, and they tend to be on the downside for interest rates.</p>
<p>That hardly tells us to give up hope on another rate cut.</p>
<p>Finally, the entire passage refers only to &quot;early&quot; monetary action, which seems to mean the next month or two.</p>
<p>He has said nothing at all about next year, yet the December and later contracts weakened on Thursday along with September.</p>
