<p>Former American teen sensation Jennifer Capriati could not cope with this year's model and was sent packing by 16-year-old compatriot Venus Williams in the second round of the Lipton Championships on Saturday.</p>
<p>Williams, projected as a sure bet future top-10 player, packed too much punch behind her strokes for Capriati and scored a 7-6 3-6 6-2 victory.</p>
<p>The 28th-ranked Capriati, who turns 21 next week, squandered a 5-1 first-set lead as her latest comeback attempt continued to sputter.</p>
<p>Williams will get to test her versatile game against a player who is already exceeding lofty expectations when she takes on soon to be world number one Martina Hingis in a battle of 16-year-olds in the third round.</p>
<p>&quot;I measure myself against myself,&quot; Williams said of the upcoming match. &quot;I would never measure myself against someone else. I feel that I'm the best, okay?&quot;</p>
<p>Earler Saturday, 12th seed and defending champion Andre Agassi was dumped 7-6 6-1 by 79th-ranked Australian Scott Draper in the second round.</p>
<p>Agassi once owned the best return of serve on the ATP Tour, but that weapon was nowhere to be found Saturday as he converted just one of 10 break points and commited 40 unforced errors.</p>
<p>Agassi, who received a first-round bye, has now lost his opening match in four successive tournaments.</p>
<p>While Agassi continues to struggle, world number one Pete Sampras just keeps chugging along.</p>
<p>The top seed crushed 77th-ranked Adrian Voinea of Romania 6-2 6-0 in a swift 48 minutes in the second round.</p>
<p>Second seed Thomas Muster was dragged into a third set, but walked away unscathed with a 6-4 2-6 6-1 victory over 69th-ranked Grant Stafford of South Africa.</p>
<p>Australian Open runner-up Carlos Moya of Spain, the seventh seed, also successfully navigated the second round with a 7-6 6-4 victory over Argentine Marcelo Charpentier.</p>
<p>Jeff Tarango, once banished from Wimbledon for bad behaviour, had another tempermental moment.</p>
<p>Tarango claimed a spectator had taunted him and threatened to kill him and the tempestuous American was ready to abandon his match unless the fan was removed from the stands.</p>
<p>The incident occurred with Tarango down 5-7, 0-40 to eighth seed Marcelo Rios of Chile. The 72nd-ranked Tarango eventually completed the match, losing 7-5 6-2.</p>
<p>Capriati appeared to have the better of Williams in the early going as she jumped out to a 5-1 lead. But a fearless and aggressive Williams, playing only her second touranment of the year, refused concede the set.</p>
<p>&quot;I think she picked up the level,&quot; Capriati said. &quot;Maybe that threw me off a little bit, then she got the momentum.&quot;</p>
<p>Williams came roaring to take a 6-5 lead but failed to convert four set points as Capriati managed to force the set into a tiebreaker.</p>
<p>But facing another set point at 5-6 in the tie-break, Capriati double-faulted away the set.</p>
<p>Capriati also took a 5-1 lead in the second set and managed to hold on this time, sending the match into a third.</p>
<p>This time it was Williams who jumped out to a 5-1 lead, allowing Capriati one more game before closing out the match.</p>
<p>&quot;When I'm down, I'm not one of those players that gets down on myself,&quot; Williams said.</p>
<p>&quot;I really try to stay real positive.&quot;</p>
