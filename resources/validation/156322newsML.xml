<p>The government emerging from Romania's general election will have to tackle budgetary and currency issues if it wants to get fresh funds from the IMF, Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said.</p>
<p>&quot;A new government in my opinion will have be quick to reverse the wrong trends which showed up in the past year, get them back on track again and get inflation again on the downward path,&quot; Zalm told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;It depends on how quick a new government is formed, how quick this new government has a good financial economic programme...Then the money will come again.&quot;</p>
<p>President Ion Iliescu, a former communist in power since 1989, leads opinion polls in a tight race for Sunday's presidential elections. But his Party for Social Democracy trails the opposition in surveys for the parliamentary vote and a coalition government is almost certain to be formed.</p>
<p>Last December, Romania signed a $280 million loan accord with the International Monetary Fund. But the Fund suspended tranches of credits earlier this year after expressing concern at restrictions on the local foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>Romanian economists also suggest the IMF is unhappy with the pace of reforms and relaxation of budgetary discipline ahead of the election.</p>
<p>Zalm made the remarks at the end of a two-day visit to Romania to discuss Romania's relations with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Romania's is represented by the Netherlands on the executive board of both institutions.</p>
<p>Zalm said restoring the free functioning of the foreign exchange market was a key issue in the talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We now have a period where is no free currency and that's very important not only for the point of view of IMF but also for the international bussiness comunity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Keen to prop the leu currency ahead of the voting, Romania restricted local markets to four dealers. The leu is quoted at 3,400/15 on the interbank market, but has slid to 4,000/4,300 at retail outlets.</p>
<p>Inflation and the budget deficit are also worrying.</p>
<p>Inflation was cut to 27.8 percent last year, but wage increases and soft credits for the inefficient farm sector have pushed it back up to a year-on-year rate of 45 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The budgetary problem will have to be tackled very quickly because with an overheated economy there was an increase in inflation. The budgetary aspect will be the most important thing to deal with,&quot; Zlam said.</p>
<p>The state budget deficit stands at 1.9 trillion lei ($563 million) in the first eight months of the year but is forecast to balloon to 4.2 trillion by the end of 1996, or some 3.5 percent of Romania's estimated gross domestic product.</p>
