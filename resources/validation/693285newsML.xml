<p>Environmental groups slammed President Bill Clinton on Thursday for refusing at a U.N. Earth Summit to announce specific targets for cutting the greenhouse gases that cause global warming.</p>
<p>But a key business group welcomed his cautious approach, saying he had softened his position from several months ago.</p>
<p>&quot;He resisted the temptation to use this highly public event to unveil draconian measures that would be harmful to our economy and harmful to the American people,&quot; said Gail McDonald, president of the oil and coal industry-backed Global Climate Coalition.</p>
<p>&quot;We urge the President to continue to evaluate the economic impacts of his climate policy and how it will affect American workers and their families,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>But Richard Mott of the Worldwide Fund for Nature said: &quot;He devoted his entire speech to global warming and the best he can do is offer up one million solar roofs.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton pleased environmentalists on Wednesday by approving tough U.S. ozone and soot-emission standards.</p>
<p>But they hoped the United States, the world's biggest polluter, would accept European Union targets cutting carbon emissions by 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010.</p>
<p>&quot;Clean air and climate protection need to be pursued together, not traded off in some Faustian bargain,&quot; said John Adams, executive director of the Natural Resources Defence Council.</p>
<p>Clinton told the summit that Washington would set significant and binding limits on emissions when industrial nations meet to discuss climate changes at Kyoto, Japan in December.</p>
<p>&quot;We must do better, and we will,&quot; he said, adding that he planned to convince the U.S. public and Congress that climate change was &quot;real and imminent.&quot;</p>
<p>Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defence Fund said: &quot;If countries whose economies are weaker than the United States are willing to commit to significant reductions in greenhouse gases, what does that say about the United States?&quot;</p>
<p>Barbara Dudley of Greenpeace said Clinton had not &quot;used this pulpit to do anything dramatic but he hasn't said 'no.' He is feeling the pressure from both sides, and right now the pressure from industry is greater.&quot;</p>
<p>Howard Ris, executive director of the Union of Concerned Scientists told Reuters, &quot;The president seems to believe that opposition to near-term action will magically disappear if he refrains from announcing specific goals and timetables.&quot;</p>
<p>Scientists say greenhouse gases from fossil fuels like coal or oil, could raise atmospheric temperatures by as much 6 degrees Fahrenheit (3.3 Celsius) by 2100.</p>
<p>They predict sea levels will rise between 12 inches (30 centimetres) and 40 inches (100 centimetres)  if greenhouse gases are not reduced.</p>
<p>The United States is responsible for 23 percent or 1.39 billion tons of the world's carbon emissions followed by China with 13.9 percent or 807 million tons. Russia is in third place with 7.2 percent or 437 million tons, Japan produces 5 percent or 302 million tons and Germany 3.8 percent or 234 million tons.</p>
