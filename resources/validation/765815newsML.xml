<title>KENYA: Kenya shilling weakens vs dlr on low inflows.</title>
<headline>Kenya shilling weakens vs dlr on low inflows.</headline>
<dateline>NAIROBI 1997-07-30</dateline>

<p>The Kenyan shilling weakened further on Wednesday as demand for dollars outstripped supply amid low inflows, forex dealers said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Kenya posted a mean commercial rate of 58.06 against the dollar on Wednesday against 57.85 at the close Tuesday. Against the pound the shilling eased to 94.69 from Tuesday's 94.44.</p>
<p>Dollar demand exceeded supply as tea export earnings fell during the low season, bank officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;Low inflows are creating a mismatch in the market,&quot; said one dealer, adding proceeds from Monday's coffee auction due to reach the market on Thursday would be too small to shore up the weakening shilling.</p>
<p>Company monthend payments would also push up the dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>The money market was more liquid with rates between 8-12 percent from 10-15 percent at the close of Tuesday's trading.</p>
<p>&quot;My guess is a lot of people will buy treasury bills tomorrow (Thursday) as the market has been very liquid,&quot; said one forex trader.</p>
