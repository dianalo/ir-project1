<p>Highlights of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu's year since his election on May 29, 1996:</p>
<p>-- SEPTEMBER VIOLENCE. Riots, including gunfights, broke out over Netanyahu's decision to create a new opening into an archaeological tourist tunnel near Moslem holy sites in Jerusalem. Sixty-one Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers died in the West Bank and Gaza Strip violence. U.S. President Bill Clinton summoned Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to the White House and coaxed them back to the peace table.</p>
<p>-- MIDDLE EAST PEACEMAKING. Netanyahu was in office nearly three months before he met Arafat, his peace partner, for the first time. But overwhelmingly backed by parliament, Netanyahu handed over most of Hebron in January, ending a 30-year occupation of the last West Bank town to get Palestinian self-rule. Later Netanyahu's government angered Palestinians with a decision giving them only nine percent more of the West Bank in the first of three promised handovers.</p>
<p>-- JEWISH SETTLEMENTS. The Likud-led Israeli government also angered Palestinians when it lifted a four-year freeze on Jewish settlement construction imposed by the previous left-centre coalition in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Then in March, Netanyahu broke ground for the Jewish settlement of Har Homa on an Arab East Jerusalem hilltop known to Palestinians as Jabal Abu Ghneim. Three days later a Palestinian bomber and three Israeli women died in a Tel Aviv cafe explosion. Middle East peacemaking has remained deadlocked since.</p>
<p>-- CORRUPTION SCANDAL. The appointment of political crony Roni Bar-On as the country's attorney-general raised questions about Netanyahu's competence and integrity. Bar-On resigned after 12 hours following a storm over his fitness for office. Then Israel Television claimed the appointment was part of an influence-peddling scheme, launching police on a three-month investigation ending in a recommendation Netanyahu face trial. In the end, Netanyahu was not charged because of what prosecutors said was insufficient evidence.</p>
<p>-- ECONOMY. Netanyahu is credited for selling off state-owned firms and slashing the budget, but so far has fallen short on other promised reforms in capital markets and the deregulating of public transport, communications and land ownership.</p>
