<p>A one-point cut in South African interest rates is possible towards the end of the third quarter and a certainty by the end of the year, a Reuters poll of economists released on Thursday showed.</p>
<p>Rates should fall further next year, with three one-point rate cuts expected by the end of 1998 from 20.25 percent at present, according to the consensus view of 31 South African and international analysts.</p>
<p>Ten-year government bond yields were expected to fall to 14.10 percent by the end of 1997 and 13.80 by end-1998 from 14.40 percent at present.</p>
<p>A slowing economy, falling inflation and an expected downturn in money supply and credit extension all held out the prospect of an easing in monetary policy later this year.</p>
<p>Rand Merchant Bank Treasury economist Julia Roy said Wednesday's news of better-than-expected consumer price inflation of 9.5 percent in May, against 9.9 percent in April, aurgured well for a rate cut.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking for a (one percent) rate cut in the third quarter -- August-September -- and it helps to strengthen that view,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals, who has pegged interest rate cut prospects to lower inflation, money supply and private sector credit extension, described the May inflation data as &quot;very encouraging&quot;.</p>
<p>The consensus forecast of economists was for CPI to average 9.0 percent in 1997 and 7.4 percent in 1998. PPI, which stood at 8.8 in April, was seen averaging 8.5 percent in 1997 and 7.5 in 1998.</p>
<p>The forecast also showed three-month money market rates were expected to decline to 14.68 percent by year-end from their current levels of between 15.50 and 15.35 percent.</p>
<p>Signs that the liquidity crunch the money market has endured for much of this year is easing have appeared in the form of falling short-term rates.</p>
<p>Analysts also believe that moves by two local commercial banks to reduce the fixed and optional home loan rates are indicative of a cut in interest rates in the near future.</p>
<p>Commenting on the easing money market conditions, Stals said on Thursday: &quot;We think that is right, that is the trend we should expect for the rest of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>He added, however, that the Reserve Bank was still reluctant to take any lead in bringing interest rates down as it wanted to ensure it consolidated the position that the inflation rate would fall.</p>
