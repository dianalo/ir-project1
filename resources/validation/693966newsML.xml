<p>Gold demand in Asia had picked up slightly but physical buying had not swelled as world prices inched up, and even activity in Hong Kong ahead of its handover to China was lacklustre, bullion dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is absolutely normal this morning, people are not rushing to buy physical gold before the handover,&quot; said a senior bullion trader.</p>
<p>Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule at midnight of June 30, making Friday the last working day under British colonial rule. Markets in the territory will reopen Thursday next week.</p>
<p>Gold has sometimes been a refuge in times of uncertainty, but analysts said that with fair political and economic prospects ahead for Hong Kong, stock and property markets have boomed and gold has been left in the dust as an investment.</p>
<p>Hong Kong premiums softened slightly from last week to around 70 US cents over the spot London market.</p>
<p>One large supplier in the territory said that its gold bar premiums were closer to 45 cents, with gold supplies still healthy after anticipated demand failed to materialise.</p>
<p>&quot;There's still a lot of gold floating around, people have brought a lot of gold in in case of (strong) demand, but it just hasn't happened,&quot; said a source at the supplier.</p>
<p>Other dealers said that gold demand was healthy below $337 per ounce.</p>
<p>Hong Kong spot gold was trading at $338.20/338.70 per ounce at 0300 GMT, a shade under its opening price at $338.30/80 per ounce, against its $338.00/50 ending in New York overnight.</p>
<p>Traders said markets were very quiet and, despite a tight range, were holding on the higher side after a bout of shortcovering in New York pulled gold back up.</p>
<p>&quot;The market still seems a little short,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Singapore traders agreed the markets were holding well and concurred that demand had not been spectacular.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand is picking up a bit but is not fantastic,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;It is much better than the last two weeks. The market is holding well.&quot;</p>
<p>Singapore dealers said they did not expect demand to be very high at this time of year, but the current spot price at around $338 an ounce was considered attractive to buyers.</p>
<p>Some dealers saw demand improving in August.</p>
<p>A Singapore source said Asian demand was still relatively thin as end-users expected prices to decline further.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a ten-year low if prices go below $330,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't expect it to go below that but it may go closer.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said Indian buying was weak as Indian domestic prices are very competitive at the moment relative to the levels in Singapore, which is a major regional distribution centre.</p>
<p>They said sales in the Thai market were poor, due to the country's recent economic problems, but demand from Malaysia and Indonesia was improving.</p>
<p>Singapore premiums firmed slightly to 75 U.S. cents an ounce over spot London prices from last week's 68-70 cents.</p>
<p>Traders said while premiums were lower than in May, adequate local gold stocks meant they were now stabilising after shooting up to between $1.0-1.50 in January and February.</p>
<p>Singapore premiums were expected to remain steady into next week they said.</p>
