<p>The chairman of a right-wing Conservative group which has pressed the government to rule out joining a single European currency on Thursday called on supporters to accept the compromise position of Prime Minister John Major.</p>
<p>Speaking to a fringe meeting at the party's annual conference in Bournemouth, Lord Cecil Parkinson said: &quot;I don't think any Conservative at this stage need keep up pressure on the cabinet to go further than they have.&quot;</p>
<p>Parkinson, a former cabinet minister, is chairman of the &quot;Conservative Way Forward.'  </p>
<p>In its quarterly magazine published just before the conference, the group said in an editorial: &quot;The current 'wait- and-see' compromise...will be quite impossible to sustain in a general election.&quot;</p>
<p>Parkinson was speaking shortly after Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, a leading supporter of a single currency, had won a standing ovation from the conference for a speech in which he backed Major's policy of not deciding on membership until after the next election.</p>
<p>&quot;Above all we must present a united front to the electorate and stop this argument about Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we carry on dividing ourselves on this issue, the beneficiaries would be a party which will take us far further into Europe,&quot; he added in a reference to the opposition Labour Party.</p>
<p>Parkinson said opponents of a single currency within the party could take comfort from the fact that Major has promised a referendum if his government did propose to jettison sterling.</p>
<p>&quot;We can win that argument, and if we can't win it, we deserve to lose it,&quot; he said.</p>
