<p>Shares in Burmah Castrol Plc powered higher on Friday on hopes the government would widen the range of companies that would be allowed to pay foreign income dividends (FIDs) after their planned abolition in 1999, dealers said.</p>
<p>A slight pullback in sterling's strength, and some expectations that the currency may be near a top, also helped lift Burmah's shares to a six-week high, they said.</p>
<p>At 0830 GMT Burmah shares traded up 22p or 2.13 percent at 10.53-1/2 stg, leading the firmer oil integrated sector.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is a bear squeeze in the stock and foreign investors look to be coming back in,&quot; one market maker said.</p>
<p>&quot;Rumours having been making the rounds for the last couple of days (on FIDs) and that has also given it a bit of a kick-start,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Financial Times said on Friday the government was examining proposals to widen the range of companies that could continue to pay FIDs, which the Treasury planned to abolish.</p>
<p>Treasury officials are also looking at longer-term reform of the advance corporation tax system, which would lighten the costs of FIDs removal for companies with a high percentage of foreign earnings, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported earlier this month that the government was expected to reverse its decision to abolish FIDs.</p>
<p>FIDs were introduced in 1993 to prevent the double taxation of dividends.</p>
<p>Other big oil company shares were also higher. British Petroleum Plc jumped 14-1/2p or 1.80 pct to 821p and Shell gained 5p or 1.14 percent to 442p.</p>
