<p>Suspected leftist rebels went on a bombing spree in a city on Colombia's frontier with Venezuela, killing an infant in one blast and blowing up a section of the country's main oil pipeline, authorities said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Police said an 18-month-old girl was killed and five people were seriously injured when two powerful car bombs rocked the border city of Cucuta late Monday.</p>
<p>The bombs, each consisting of about 110 pounds (50 kg) of dynamite, went off as National Police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano was in the city to attend the funeral of a policeman killed in a weekend guerrilla attack.</p>
<p>Serrano blamed the bombings, which seriously damaged five banks and several shops, on National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas.</p>
<p>Police said ELN rebels were also believed responsible for a pre-dawn attack on Tuesday on the Cano Limon oil pipeline just outside Cucuta.</p>
<p>Radio reports, which could not be immediately confirmed, said about 10,000 barrels of crude oil were spilled in the dynamite attack on the pipeline, which runs from the northeastern Cano Limon field to the Caribbean coast oil terminal of Covenas.</p>
<p>Pumping along the pipeline, which carries about 200,000 barrels a day, was suspended indefinitely.</p>
<p>The attack was the 13th on the pipeline this year. The structure was dynamited more than 40 times last year.</p>
<p>The ELN, founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in the 1960s, is Colombia's second largest guerrilla force and specializes in attacks on multinational companies and oil infrastructure.</p>
<p>Cucuta is the capital of Norte de Santander province. In its sister province of Santander, police said unidentified assailants hurled two hand grenades into the home of a local official early Tuesday in the small town of Sabana de Torres.</p>
<p>Three people were killed in the attack and 15 were injured, police said.</p>
