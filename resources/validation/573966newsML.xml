<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian stocks rise on stronger Dow, metals.</title>
<headline>Australian stocks rise on stronger Dow, metals.</headline>

<p>Australian stocks quickly regained most of Thursday's losses at the opening on Friday after a rebound on Wall Street and with resources well-supported after stronger metal prices and firmer bullion and oil prices.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index was 9.4 points up at 2,514.1 at the opening. The index closed 12.9 points down on Thursday. About A$166 million (US$130 million) worth of shares was traded early.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was likely to trade in a narrow range with few local issues around today and with investors setting their positions ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;It is pretty subdued at the moment. I don't think there is anything standing out,&quot; said one Melbourne-based broker.</p>
<p>Brokers said chemical group ICI Australia was steady after sliding about nine percent on Thursday after its British parent ICI Plc unveiled plans to sell its stake, worth around A$2 billion.</p>
<p>Market leader BHP topped the turnover charts with over A$100 million worth of trade. The resource giant announced plans after Thursday's market close for a A$636 million share issue based on shareholders buying small parcels of shares.</p>
<p>Traders said oil stocks continued their recent rally buoyed by sharp gains in U.S. cash crude prices. Gold and base metal miners shares were also well-supported after strong gains in metal prices on the LME and higher gold futures in New York.</p>
<p>Banks were broadly firmer, continuing their recent gains ahead of a new round of interim results. National Australia Bank and Westpac both report next week.</p>
<p>(A$=US$0.7800)</p>
