<title>UK: Shell executive slams trade sanctions.</title>
<headline>Shell executive slams trade sanctions.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-28</dateline>

<p>In an apparent attack on the United States, a senior Shell official on Monday said governments should not impose unilateral trade bans on other nations.</p>
<p>Mark Moody-Stuart, group managing director of Royal Dutch/Shell, also told an oil conference that oil companies have no business getting involved in the politics of countries in which they operate.</p>
<p>&quot;Our industry in many countries is the dominant industry but that doesn't give us the right to tell those countries what to do. Take that one step higher, I am not sure it is right for the major dominant country to tell others what to do.&quot;</p>
<p>Moody-Stuart was apparently referring to Washington's D'Amato Act which imposes sanctions on foreign companies investing $40 million or more a year in Iran or Libya.</p>
<p>Washington's unilateral action on oil-rich Libya and Iran and later on Cuba has drawn the ire of the European Union which plans to vote on measures to counter the anti-Cuban trade laws.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not sure it is helpful for countries to extend their boycotts into secondary countries,&quot; Moody-Stuart said.</p>
<p>Moody-Stuart also talked of growing pressures on large oil companies to speak out in nations where they operate massive oil and gas facilities.</p>
<p>But &quot;trying to exert political influence is counterproductive,&quot; he said. &quot;Discrete representation might be Shell came under fire last year for not doing more to intervene against the execution in Nigeria of minority rights campaigner Ken Saro-Wiwa. Shell produces about half of Nigeria's 2.0 million barrels per day oil output.</p>
<p>Thierry Desmarest, chairman and chief executive officer of French oil company Total SA, which is heading up the Sirri project in Iran, defended his company's involvement in Iran.</p>
<p>&quot;Total is a company which does not want to interfere in political problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Desmarest, who was speaking at the conference, was asked to justify Total's work in Iran by Gregg Rickman, legislative director in the office of U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato who authored the anti-Tehran law.</p>
<p>Desmarest said it was not the first time Total had been at the centre of &quot;politics problems.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If there were international EU or French law that prevented us, we would not invest.</p>
<p>&quot;When there is just legislation put in place by a third country which tends to have extraterritorial legislation, we do not think we have to take particular care of that legislation,&quot; he added.</p>
