<title>RUSSIA: Rebel chief says Chechnya is not part of Russia.</title>
<headline>Rebel chief says Chechnya is not part of Russia.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-10-06</dateline>

<p>A top Chechen separatist commander, who signed a peace deal with Moscow, declared in a television interview shown on Sunday that Chechnya would never agree to be part of Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;No Chechen has ever signed any kind of document saying that Chechnya is a part of Russia and there will never be such a Chechen,&quot; rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov told Russian Public Television.</p>
<p>Maskhadov and Russian security chief Alexander Lebed signed a peace deal on August 31 ending 21 months of war, which started when Russia sent troops to quell the southern region's independence bid in December 1994. Tens of thousands of people, mainly civilians, have died in the conflict.</p>
<p>Lebed has said a five-year deferral of decision on whether Chechnya should become independent, agreed as a part of the deal, was meant to cool tempers and allow to keep the region from breaking away in exchange for granting it strong autonomy.</p>
<p>Lebed's opponents, led by Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov, attacked him in parliament last week saying that the agreement, which also provided for Russian troops withdrawal from Chechnya, in fact rubberstamped its secession.</p>
<p>&quot;Chechnya has never been (part of Russia) so it does not need to break away,&quot; Maskhadov said.</p>
