<title>GERMANY: Bunds seen back in ranges after Thursday's jump.</title>
<headline>Bunds seen back in ranges after Thursday's jump.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-06-13</dateline>

<p>After surging Thursday afternoon, Bund futures are likely to resume range-trading on Friday at least until U.S. data are released, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected the DTB September futures contract to trade between 101.20 and 101.50 until U.S. producer price data are released at 1230 GMT, after which time all bets about the market's direction are off.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a fairly stable market,&quot; one trader said. &quot;Things look like they will stay in ranges during the morning.&quot;  </p>
<p>The PPI data, however, are not the only data due from the U.S. The Michigan consumer sentiment index is scheduled to be released at 1400 GMT.</p>
<p>Traders said after Bunds got a major boost from Treasuries Thursday afternoon, it was hard to guess how the market would react to the latest U.S. indicators, one saying the market could fall as low as 101.00 or climb toward 102.00.</p>
<p>The major domestic topic of the day will be the Franco-German summit where the stability pact on EMU is at the top of the agenda.  </p>
<p>Traders said, however, France is unlikely to press ahead with demands to substantially renegotiate the pact and that the meeting is likely to present a unified front on EMU.</p>
<p>EU monetary affairs commissioner, Yves-Thibault de Silguy, said the stability pact was ready to be signed. A press conference is scheduled for around 1400 GMT.</p>
<p>The benchmark 10-year Bund was little changed in morning trade at 102.06, down slightly from 102.10 to yield 5.72 percent.</p>
