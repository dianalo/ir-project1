<headline>Sudan says Eritreans, rebels shelling border posts.</headline>
<dateline>KHARTOUM 1997-03-27</dateline>

<p>Sudan said on Thursday that Eritrean troops and Sudanese rebels had been shelling Sudanese army positions on the Eritrean border.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the early hours of Wednesday the Eritrean forces and a group of the outlaws started shelling the army advance posts in Garoura and Itairba,&quot; army spokesman Lieutenant-General Mohammed al-Senoussi Ahmed said in a statement.</p>
<p>The general said the attackers planned to control border areas of eastern Sudan. &quot;Our troops are mounting a tough resistance to thwart the intentions of the enemy,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The exact location of the border posts was not immediately clear but the small town of Karora lies just inside Sudan and about 40 km (25 miles) from the Red Sea coast. Sudanese place names are often transliterated in many different ways.</p>
<p>The army spokesman did not give details of any casualties or elaborate on the intensity of the shelling.</p>
<p>Northern rebels of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) attacked the army on the Sudanese side of the Eritrean border in January but the offensive failed to win much territory.</p>
<p>Rebel units further south, led by the southern-based Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), captured the Sudanese towns of Kurmuk and Qeissan on the Ethiopian border in an attack coordinated with that of the northerners.</p>
<p>The Sudanese government said Eritrean and Ethiopian forces did most of the fighting in both attacks but the two countries, despite poor relations with Khartoum, said their troops had nothing to do with the attacks.</p>
<p>The military campaign against the Islamist government shifted earlier this month to the far south, where the SPLA captured the town of Yei and began to advance towards the town of Juba, the largest in the whole of the south.</p>
<p>Khartoum says Ugandan troops are fighting in the south but the Ugandan government denies this.</p>
<p>A member of parliament from eastern Sudan was quoted on Thursday as saying that Eritrean forces had been massing east of Tokar, a town about 100 km northeast of Karora, with plans to open a new front on the Red Sea coast.</p>
<p>The member of parliament, Abu Ali Majzoub, told the independent newspaper Alwan that the Eritreans had help from the Sudanese opposition groups.</p>
<p>SPLA commander John Garang told Reuters in January that part of the rebel strategy was to cut communications between Khartoum and Port Sudan on the Red Sea, Sudan's main commercial link with the rest of the world.</p>
