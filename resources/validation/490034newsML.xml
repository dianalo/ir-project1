<headline>Carrey's &quot;Liar Liar&quot; Passes $100 Million.</headline>
<dateline>LOS ANGELES</dateline>
<text>
<p>&quot;Liar Liar&quot; ruled the box office for the third consecutive weekend, and became the first new release of 1997 to break the $100 million mark, according to studio estimates released Sunday.</p>
<p>The Jim Carrey comedy, in which the rubber-faced comic plays a lawyer who must tell the truth for one day, earned about $18.5 million during the Friday to Sunday period, easing just 27 percent from the previous weekend.</p>
<p>Its per-screen average of $6,421 was the second highest in the top 10, and its 17-day total stands at $100.9 million. The only other film to break $100 million this year was the &quot;Star Wars&quot; reissue, which has earned more than $136 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Liar Liar&quot; is released by Universal Pictures, a unit of Seagram Co. Ltd..</p>
<p>The top 10 contained four new releases, of which just one -- &quot;The Saint&quot; in second place -- performed strongly. The others were &quot;That Old Feeling&quot; in fourth, &quot;Double Team&quot; in fifth and &quot;Inventing the Abbotts&quot; in 10th.</p>
<p>However, &quot;Chasing Amy,&quot; a boy-meets-lesbian comedy from the writer/director of &quot;Clerks,&quot; Kevin Smith, played strongly in exclusive release. The movie earned $57,112 from three screens, for an average of $19,037. It is released by Miramax Films, a unit of Walt Disney Co.</p>
<p>Paramount Pictures' &quot;The Saint,&quot; starring Val Kilmer and Elisabeth Shue, earned $16.2 million for an average of $7,000. The movie, based liberally on late novelist Leslie Charteris' books about an enigmatic thief, underwhelmed critics. According to a Variety poll of reviewers in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington DC, six liked it, 13 did not and 16 were mixed. Entertainment Weekly gave it an &quot;F.&quot;</p>
<p>Paramount is a unit of Viacom Inc..</p>
<p>A long way back in third was &quot;The Devil's Own,&quot; the Harrison Ford/Brad Pitt thriller, which slipped one notch in its second weekend with $7.4 million. The Columbia Pictures movie, which cost about $90 million to make, fell a hefty 48 percent, and averaged $2,955. Its gross to date is $30 million. Columbia is a unit of Sony Corp..</p>
<p>&quot;That Old Feeling,&quot; a Universal romantic comedy starring Bette Midler and Dennis Farina, opened in fourth with $5.2 million for an average of $3,302. &quot;Double Team,&quot; a Columbia action movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dennis Rodman, was close behind with $5.0 million and a non-muscular average of $2,270.</p>
<p>The biggest percentage drop in the top 10 belonged to &quot;Selena,&quot; the biopic about the late Tejano singing star. In its third weekend, the Warner Bros. movie fell five places to eighth with $2.7 million. This represents a 56 percent tumble. The movie's gross to date is $27 million. While critics liked it, the Time Warner Inc. -owned studio lamented that it did not display much crossover to non-Latino audiences.</p>
<p>The last of the new releases in the top 10, &quot;Inventing the Abbotts,&quot; a period romantic drama with an ensemble cast featuring Liv Tyler and real-life boyfriend Joaquin Phoenix, earned $2.4 million in 10th for an average of $2,676. The movie is released by 20th Century Fox, a unit of News Corp..</p>
