<title>VIETNAM: HK men face death penalty in Vietnam drugs trial.</title>
<headline>HK men face death penalty in Vietnam drugs trial.</headline>
<dateline>HANOI 1997-03-27</dateline>

<p>Two Hong Kong men will go on trial for their lives in southern Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City on Friday, charged with drug trafficking in one of the communist country's biggest drugs cases.</p>
<p>Senior local judge Nguyen Duc Sau told Reuters on Thursday the two men had been arrested in March last year at the southern city's Tan Son Nhat airport with 18.1 kg (40 pounds) of heroin.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the biggest heroin haul so far, and they will be tried on charges of 'illegally trafficking in drugs',&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sau said the two men had been travelling under false names, using Portuguese passports. He gave their real identities as Sun Chi Kin and Chan Chun Hung Sam My, both British passport holders.</p>
<p>Under Vietnamese law convicted drug-traffickers can face the death penalty.</p>
<p>A Vietnamese-Canadian woman was sentenced to death last week in Hanoi after being found guilty of attempting to smuggle 5.45 kg (12 pounds) of heroin out of the country.</p>
<p>Her case is still open to appeal.</p>
<p>Drugs experts say Vietnam is both a growing market and a transit route for narcotics from the notorious Golden Triangle opium-poppy growing area, which straddles the borders of Laos, Burma and Thailand. Heroin is derived from opium.</p>
<p>Diplomats at the British consulate in Ho Chi Minh City said they had visited the two men and would be attending the trial on Friday.</p>
