<p>Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila, who has seized parts of eastern Zaire, has said he might take his rebellion onwards to Kinshasa to oust President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>&quot;We reserve the right to keep pursuing our liberation movement to Kinshasa,&quot; Kabila said in an interview to the Paris-based weekly Nouvel Afrique Asie to be published on Monday.</p>
<p>Kabila set two conditions for the restoration of peace in Africa's Great Lakes central region: an end to French support for Mobutu and his departure from power.</p>
<p>&quot;First: the departure of Mobutu who for 30 years has only brought corruption, dictatorship and repression, causing the ruin of Congo-Zaire,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The second condition is that France end its policy of intervention in favour of this despot it is imposing upon our people,&quot; he added, accusing Paris of preparing military intervention to help Mobutu regain control of eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;Let no one believe any longer that we'll keep our arms folded when we see the first French soldier or paratrooper in this region,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mobutu, who has been in Europe for more than three months, is recovering from cancer surgery at his French Riviera villa.</p>
<p>He has indicated he may be returning home this weekend, but his security aide Honore Ngbanda said in Kinshasa he was not expected before next week.</p>
<p>In his absence, Zaire has been gripped by violence and a refugee crisis following Kabila's rebellion of Rwandan-backed ethnic Tutsis in two eastern provinces. More than a million Rwandan and Burundian Hutu camp refugees and Zairean villagers have been displaced in the fighting.</p>
<p>France, which has been pushing for a U.N.-sponsored force to help refugees, has ruled out intervening on its own.</p>
<p>Kabila repeated his opposition to the multinational force agreed in a Security Council resolution to ensure aid gets to the refugees.</p>
<p>&quot;This resolution is null and void,&quot; he said. &quot;Who wants it today? Ask the countries who were committed to taking part.&quot;</p>
<p>Support for the plan has been waning since more than half a million Hutu refugees the force was supposed to help returned to their homes in Rwanda earlier this month.</p>
<p>Rwanda has said the force is no longer needed.</p>
<p>Kabila's rebel coalition routed the Zairean army in an offensive that began in mid-October and ousted Rwandan Hutu extremists from refugee camps in the area, triggering the refugees' return home.</p>
<p>His Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) holds key airports in the border towns of Goma, Bukavu and Uvira which the multinational force would have to secure in order to bring in aid to the refugees.</p>
