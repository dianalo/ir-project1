<p>Pace bowler Andrew Bichel set up a decisive Sheffield Shield win for Queensland over Victoria on Monday by taking 10 wickets in the match in a career-best performance.</p>
<p>Bichel took 5-69 in Victoria's second innings to add to his first innings haul of 5-46 as Queensland beat Victoria by eight wickets to maintain their lead in the Shield standings.</p>
<p>Queensland have 18 points from three wins this season and are 10 clear of New South Wales in second place.</p>
<p>Victoria were dismissed in their second innings for 277 after adding only nine runs to their overnight total for a paltry lead of 134.</p>
<p>Opening batsman Matthew Hayden hit 73 as Queensland reached 137 for two with over a session of play remaining.</p>
<p>In Adelaide, Western Australia captain Tom Moody hit 89 not out to help his side to victory by five wickets over South Australia.</p>
<p>Set a target of 285 to win, Western Australia reached 288 for five in the final session of play. Damien Martyn added 37 to his first innings of 96.</p>
<p>The win was Western Australia's first of the season from two matches while South Australia remain at the bottom of the Shield table with no points.</p>
<p>In Hobart, Tasmania came within one wicket of outright defeat by New South Wales before salvaging a draw.</p>
<p>New South Wales declared their second innings closed on 225 for three 30 minutes before lunch after a whirlwind 101 not out by all-rounder Shane Lee.</p>
<p>Tasmania, needing 302 for an unlikely win, reached 268 for nine in reply, tail-enders Mark Ridgeway and Mark Atkinson successfully fending away the final 14 deliveries before stumps were drawn.</p>
<p>New South Wales earned two points for their superior first innings total of 403 for nine declared.</p>
