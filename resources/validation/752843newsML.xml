<p>Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co Inc (Metrobank) reported solid first-half profit growth on Thursday and analysts said the bank should remain the industry leader in the Philippines despite growing competition and uncertainty in financial markets.</p>
<p>Metrobank reported first-half 1997 earnings grew to 2.73 billion pesos ($95 million), up 34.29 percent from 2.03 billion in the same period last year.</p>
<p>&quot;This is in line with our expectation. Considering it accounts for 40 percent of our full-year target, I think our full-year target is also achievable,&quot; said Audi Pantillano, a banking analyst at Angping Securities.</p>
<p>Angping had projected earnings of 2.7 to 2.8 billion pesos for the country's biggest bank in terms of assets and profitability. It forecast a 6.853 billion peso net for the full year.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of six securities firms last month showed an average of 2.68 billion pesos in profit was seen for the first half of 1997, and 6.63 billion for the whole year.</p>
<p>The bank itself is projecting a 6.65 billion peso net this year, up from 5.002 billion in 1996.</p>
<p>Pantillano said recent turmoil in foreign exchange markets and rising interest rates would not affect Metrobank's bottom line.</p>
<p>The peso was recently hit by heavy speculation, forcing the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rates to 2-1/2 year highs and allow a de facto devaluation which saw the peso depreciate as much as 11 percent at one point.</p>
<p>Analysts said foreign-currency-denominated loans comprise 25 percent of Metrobank's total loan portfolio, which is relatively small compared to other banks, which have 30 to 35 percent exposure.</p>
<p>The bank's loan portfolio grew to 12.13 billion pesos in the first six months of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Metrobank has moderate exposure on foreign currency loans. And since most of the dollar loans were lent out to finance trade, I don't think it will cause a lot of problems for the bank,&quot; Pantillano added.</p>
<p>Rachel Evangelista, an analyst at All AsiaCapital and Trust Corp, said Metrobank borrowers were mostly dollar-earners themselves so a more expensive dollar would not trigger a massive loan default.</p>
<p>Analysts said the weak peso and high interest rates might temper loan growth, but investments in higher yielding instruments could easily offset the lower interest income.</p>
<p>Net interest income improved by 57.26 percent in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>Magnum International Securities said Metrobank's near-term prospects remained bright despite the prevailing uncertainties in the financial markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Metrobank is a good company in baht times,&quot; Magnum said in a report, referring to turmoil surrounding the Thai baht that triggered speculative attacks on several Southeast Asian currencies, including the attack on the peos.</p>
<p>Evangelista said the bank's extensive network of middle and upper-income clients would generate enough volume for the bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Metrobank is still able to maintain its top position...because of the volume and relationships it developed throughout the years,&quot; she added.</p>
