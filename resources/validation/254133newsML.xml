<text>
<p>Hong Kong stocks closed down on Thursday, with investors nervously consolidating gains of recent months, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market opened nervous and confused, partly because of to the decline in the U.S., and partly due to the technical glitch,&quot; said Claire Burges Watson in institutional sales at Kim Eng Securities.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index closed down 136.32 points at 13,053.28, after briefly touching a day low of 12,960.81.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 70.73 to 6,402.52 on Wednesday, despite benign inflation indications from the 0.4 percent rise in the producer price index for November, also released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The U.S. consumer price index for November will be released later on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There seems to be a recovery in sentiment,&quot; said Burges Watson, adding she expected to see overseas market recover and the Hang Seng to follow.</p>
<p>A technical malfunction of the stock exchange's automatic order matching and execution system caused some chaos at the opening of the market on Thursday.</p>
<p>HSI Services Ltd, which is independent of the exchange and calculates the Hang Seng Index and other indices used by the exchange, said on Thursday afternoon that the Hang Seng Index, Hang Seng Midcap 50 Index and Hang Seng China Enteprises would require further verification.</p>
<p>The company said it would issue official opening, high, low and closing quotes for each index.</p>
<p>The finance sector was the worst performing, followed by the commercial and industrial sector.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng China Enterprise Index showed the greatest decline, following three days of strong gains.</p>
<p>Traders said trading in Hang Seng Index futures was active and chaotic, but that the technical problem, chiefly with the historical prices, did not affect current index calculations.</p>
<p>The December contract closed down 20 points at 13,130, a 77-point premium to the cash market, and the January contract closed down 25 points at 13,185, a 132-point premium.</p>
