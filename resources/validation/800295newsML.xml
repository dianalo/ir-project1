<p>Australian bonds are vying with New Zealand paper for the top spot among the dollar bloc, economists said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But ongoing currency woes in New Zealand mean Australia probably has the edge, with their spread over U.S. Treasuries likely to narrow to zero over the next few months.</p>
<p>&quot;Taking bonds and currency together, Australia is probably the best bet (of the dollar bloc),&quot; said Stephen Lewis, chief economist at London Bond Broking.</p>
<p>&quot;We're now accumulating evidence the Australian economy is sluggish, and that it's not going to recover as rapidly in the second half of the year as everyone was expecting,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Lewis said it wouldn't be long before the market would be discounting a 50 basis point cut in official interest rates -- likely to materialise in late October.</p>
<p>&quot;So we could well see the 10-year spread (with Treasuries) getting to zero in the next few months.&quot;</p>
<p>By midday, that spread was at 38 basis points, down from around 60 basis points two months ago.</p>
<p>Benign final Q2 Australian wages data released on Thursday added to expectations the Reserve Bank would shave another 50 basis points off the official rate of 5.0 percent. The central bank last cut rates by 50 basis points on July 30.</p>
<p>Michael Derks, cross market fixed income strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London, also singled out Australia as a top performer in the dollar bloc, but said it was a close call with New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Both those markets look terrific,&quot; he said. &quot;Australia is probably a slightly safer bet, but I really like New Zealand too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rates there are far, far too high, so if you can stand the currency volatility, it offers an excellent yield pick up over other markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>New Zealand still has one of the highest yields and lowest rates of inflation in the world, making it relatively attractive in real terms.</p>
<p>But with the economy floundering, the Kiwi dollar  has been under pressure recently and analysts saw few prospects of it gaining a firmer footing anytime soon.</p>
<p>Michael Burke, bond strategist at Citibank in London, was also bullish on New Zealand, despite the currency risk.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of simple growth and inflation outlooks, you've got to assume the New Zealand market will be the best performer (of the dollar bloc),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Despite persistent currency worries, Burke said New Zealand bonds would likely outperform.</p>
<p>But the shaky Kiwi dollar was enough to put Lewis off buying the paper.</p>
<p>&quot;From time to time one is tempted by New Zealand, but one is wise to resist that temptation,&quot; he said. &quot;It's still a choppy market where the central bank seems to have lost control of its own monetary policy.&quot;</p>
<p>Last week, the country's Monetary Conditions Index -- which measures the mix of the wholesale 90-day bank bill rates and the Kiwi dollar's trade-weighted index -- fell below the Reserve Bank's desired level, leaving monetary conditions looser than they would like.</p>
<p>If analysts are split on the relative appeal of Australia and New Zealand, they are certainly agreed on the gloomy prospects for Canada.</p>
<p>A slipping currency and a buoyant economy mean a tightening of monetary policy could be a matter of weeks away, rather than months, said Burke.</p>
<p>&quot;Canada I would just regard as expensive,&quot; agreed Lewis. &quot;That spread with Treasuries will probably gradually go back towards parity, though the timetable will be more drawn out than in Australia's case -- about six months.</p>
<p>By midday, the Canadian spread with Treasuries was at -37 basis points.</p>
