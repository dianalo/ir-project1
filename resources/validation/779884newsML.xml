<p>Kuwait's prosecution on Tuesday sought death sentences against three Kuwaitis and two Iranians who denied involvement in a failed bid to kill an opposition MP.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prosecution General demands the imposition of the maximum penalty...,&quot; prosecutor Adel al-Juwai'ed told a criminal court on the first hearing of the case. &quot;The punishment is execution,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kuwaiti defendants Salman Ahmad al-Shamlan, 41, Abdul-Mohsen al-Roumi, 37, Adel Mohammad al-Mchaimi, 42, and Iranian Sayed Abdul-Hadi Sayed Ali Ardabili, 19, denied charges of attempting to kill leading liberal MP Abdullah al-Naibari and his wife.</p>
<p>Iranian defendant Sayed Mohammad Sayed Ali Ardabili, 25, told Judge Ibrahim al-Obeid in Arabic: &quot;The intention was different,&quot; commenting on the attempted murder charge, while Mchaimi told the court he took Naibari to hospital.</p>
<p>Gunmen ambushed Naibari's car on June 6 as he drove in a southern beach area. Naibari, 61, is receiving medical attention in the United States for wounds in the jaw and shoulder, while his wife suffered a superficial bullet wound near her left shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;There were political pressures in this case...because Naibari is a member of the National Assembly,&quot; said Najib al-Wougayan, defence lawyer for Roumi. &quot;I was prevented from attending the investigation,&quot; he added without elaboration.</p>
<p>&quot;They (investigators) were influenced by the spotlights,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The court turned down a request to release Roumi on bail and set August 26 for a second hearing to allow lawyers to review the case documents. The five defendants are detained.</p>
<p>Mohsen al-Mutairi, a member of Naibari's lawyers team, asked the court to allow Kuwait University specialists to examine the bullets used in the attack because Naibari &quot;has suffered a form of undetermined poisoning&quot;. He did not explain.</p>
<p>Mutairi demanded a preliminary compensation of 500,000 dinars ($1.64 million), while a lawyer representing Furaih demanded 5,001 dinars also as a preliminary compensation.</p>
<p>Several MPs linked the attack to parliament's relentless questioning about financial scandals in which they claim former officials mismanaged and squandered public funds.</p>
<p>The government has urged parliament to avoid triggering an internal strife over the attempt, saying there was no evidence that the attack was politically motivated.</p>
<p>Naibari played a key role in parliamentary efforts to combat what some MPs described as graft at state-run institutions.</p>
