<p>Thailand's oil companies may be forced to raise domestic oil product prices over the next few months due to higher costs of importing crude as a result of the lower baht, analysts and oil company sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;A price rise is inevitable,&quot; said Robin Shoemaker at Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong. &quot;Whether it is today or next week, the price increase will have to happen.&quot;</p>
<p>Oil companies in Thailand told Reuters they were considering raising wholesale domestic prices of oil products.</p>
<p>&quot;Refiners should have enough crude oil inventories to meet their requirements for the next month or so,&quot; Shoemaker said.</p>
<p>&quot;But they will be suffering poor margins in the short term, and they will have to pass the costs onto the consumers.&quot;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Thai government allowed the baht to float, replacing a system which had pegged the baht to a basket of currencies dominated by the dollar.</p>
<p>The baht plunged 20 percent in the offshore markets and was last quoted at $28.10/$29.10 per dollar following the flotation. Although new refineries coming onstream in the last year have sharply reduced Thailand's need to import refined oil products, Thailand is largely dependent on imported crude.</p>
<p>Thai bunker traders said the country's bunker fuel market came to a standstill on Thursday as suppliers tried to decide whether or not to raise prices.</p>
<p>&quot;We are waiting for the major suppliers like Shell and PTT (Petroleum Authority of Thailand) to adjust their prices. They are expected to move prices higher by between $4 and $5 per tonne,&quot; said a bunker trader in Bangkok.</p>
<p>Thai bunker prices were quoted at $104-108 per tonne before the baht was floated.</p>
<p>Another bunker said domestic diesel prices had already increased by 40 satang per litre on Thursday.</p>
<p>But officials at refineries said authorities had asked oil companies to maintain prices at current levels to prevent inflationary pressure from mounting.</p>
<p>They said such a move would give the authorities time to decide on a reasonable exchange rate for the sale of oil products from refiners to endusers.</p>
<p>Some analysts said excess refining capacity and ample domestic supplies of gasoline could help limit the rate of increase in domestic fuel prices.</p>
<p>&quot;It is obvious that the baht devaluation will increase import costs for refiners who do not have access to domestic crude oil,&quot; said Gordon Kwan of Daiwa Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is an excess in domestic supplies of gasoline, and in refining capacity in Thailand, which means refiners cannot afford to raise prices,&quot; Kwan said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Thai refiner Bangchak Petroleum Plc sought a one-year period to pay its suppliers for its latest spot import tender, a move which traders said was linked to the lower baht.</p>
<p>Bangchak often requested credit extensions for its monthly purchase of crude, but it was normally for a 60-to-90-day period, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The longest credit time they have ever asked for was 120 days,&quot; said a trader with a major oil company. &quot;It is definitely connected to the baht issue.&quot;</p>
