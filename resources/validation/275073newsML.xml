<p>Tokyo stocks are expected to post a technical rebound on Wednesday, after the key stock index tumbled to a fresh 12-month low on the previous day, brokers said. On Tuesday, the benchmark Nikkei 225 average slid a hefty 528.75 points or 2.69 percent to close at 19,161.71.</p>
<p>This was its lowest level since December 19, 1995, when the stock index closed at 19,140.49.</p>
<p>March Nikkei futures tumbled 340 points to finish the session at 19,250.  </p>
<p>&quot;I expect the Nikkei 225 to bounce back slightly,&quot; said an analyst at a second-tier securities house.</p>
<p>He said that the level that could prompt technical buy-backs was 19,053, which is 2,559 points lower than the closing high of 21,612 on October 18. The index had shed 2,559 points in the downward correction from June 26 to September 2, he said.</p>
<p>Another broker said that short positions have accumulated in the recent steep fall, which could prompt many brokers to buy back today, the last trading day for settlement within this year.  </p>
<p>Turnover was a light 141 million shares at midday, against 142 million shares by Tuesday noon.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no particular active selling or buying in the market,&quot; said a trader at a second-tier securities house.</p>
<p>Trading was relatively subdued, partly because today is the last trading day for settlement within this year, brokers said.</p>
<p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 638 to 384, while 221 issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>Other stock indices also posted modest gains. The broader TOPIX index rose 10.91 points or 0.75 percent to 1,459.36. The Nikkei 300 was up 2.63 points or 0.96 percent at 277.99.  </p>
<p>Brokers said a lack of buying incentives for investors could send the benchmark Nikkei 225 average lower by the end of this year or early next year.</p>
<p>Among sectors, gainers were led by real estate, insurance, automobiles, warehousing and rubber. The notable losing sectors were mining, gas and transportation equipment.</p>
<p>On the new second section of the over-the-counter market, shares in A&amp;Cmos Inc, a Tokyo-based integrated circuit maker, made their debut at 266,000 yen, well above the public offering price of 200,000 yen.</p>
