<title>UK: Stakis sub-underwriting put out to tender.</title>

<p>Sub-underwriting of the 222 million pounds rights issue set by hotels group Stakis on Thursday has been put out to tender by investment bank Schroders in an innovative move aimed at achieving lower commission rates, Schroders said.</p>
<p>One third of the sub-underwriting of the issue, whereby investment institutions, such as life insurance or pension funds, guarantee to take up a proportion of the shares, has been allocated for the tender, which closes at 1300 GMT.  </p>
<p>Schroders said in a statement it will reduce the commission it charges its client, Stakis, for the primary underwriting of the issue at the same rate as any reduction in sub-underwriting charges which may result from the tender.  </p>
<p>&quot;We feel the time is right to launch an innovation to test the proposition of whether there is latent demand for sub-underwriting at lower rates,&quot; Matthew Whittell of Schroders told Reuters.</p>
<p>The move, thought to be the first innovation for decades in the underwriting structure in the London equity market, comes at a time when the system is under scrutiny.</p>
<p>Competition watchdog the Office of Fair Trading and industry bodies the Assocation of British Insurers (ABI) and National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) have all addressed the issue of fixed commissions.  </p>
<p>Whittell said Schroders thought the current underwriting system has served well, giving companies raising money security and also distributing risk very rapidly on commission rates which are competitive compared with fund raising in other markets overseas.</p>
<p>He said the move was an attempt to achieve lower commissions for Schroders' client, but within the current underwriting framework and law, and was part of an evolutionary process rather than something completely new.</p>
<p>Schroders will issue a statement at the close on Thursday to announce the results of the tender and any resulting reduction in total commission charged.</p>
