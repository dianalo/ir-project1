<p>South Africa on Wednesday won its second investment grade credit rating from a U.S.-accredited agency, signalling growing confidence in the country and paving the way for a major dollar bond issue.</p>
<p>Duff &amp; Phelps Credit Rating Co said it had assigned an investment grade BBB minus rating to the country's foreign currency debt, matching the assessment of Moody's Investors Service Inc.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance said the rating was significant given that certain U.S. investors, such as insurance funds, were restricted in terms of their investments when a country did not have two investment grade ratings from U.S.-accredited agencies.</p>
<p>The move comes ahead of South Africa's second Yankee bond issue, expected in the next few weeks, which dealers say is likely to raise around $500 million.</p>
<p>&quot;We can access a wider array of capital sources in the United States, and we think this is good for South Africa's future Yankees,&quot; Finance Minister Trevor Manuel told reporters during a visit to Tokyo.</p>
<p>Analysts welcomed the news which they said also augured well for an upgrade from influential agency Standard and Poor's Corp later this year.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a good indication. The importance really is that it suggests there might be an upgrade from the more important credit rating agencies,&quot; said Nico Czypionka, chief economist at Standard Bank in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>South Africa's long-term foreign currency debt currently straddles investment grade. Moody's Investors Service Inc rates the country an investment grade prospect at Baa3. But S&amp;P has it pegged one notch below at BB plus.</p>
<p>S&amp;P is expected to visit South Africa around September or October and Guido Cipriani, S&amp;P director responsible for South Africa, told Reuters in May that prospects had improved since the agency's last visit in September 1996.</p>
<p>Mike Brown, chief economist at SocGen Frankel Pollak, is confident of an S&amp;P upgrade following a cut in the 1997/98 budget deficit, a recent sharp rise in foreign reserves and important exchange control relaxation effective from July 1.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd be surprised if they don't upgrade us,&quot; Brown said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we've met the monetary and fiscal targets, we've got the reserves and we are dismantling exchange controls. We are basically there -- our only element of risk is crime and violence, and I'm not sure how they will mark us on that.&quot;</p>
<p>Duff &amp; Phelps said its rating view reflected the strong commitment of the government to establish a competitive and creditworthy economy, backed up by its medium-term Growth, Employment and Redistribution (Gear) strategy.</p>
<p>However, the rating was constrained by continued high fiscal deficits, low domestic savings, high unemployment, still relatively low reserves and high crime rates.</p>
<p>IBCA, the only other agency to have rated South Africa in the last two years, currently has the country on a speculative BB. A company official said on Wednesday that IBCA was unlikely to review this rating until November or December.</p>
