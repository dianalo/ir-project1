<p>The Ohio River fell below flood stage at Cincinnati for the first time in nine days Tuesday but to the west the bloated and debris-filled stream continued to turn parts of towns into swamps.</p>
<p>The highest water levels Tuesday ranged from Evansville, Ind., to Golconda, Ill., the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers office in Louisville said.</p>
<p>At Henderson, Ky., Police Chief Ed Brady said &quot;to the east of here, there has been a lot of devasatation,&quot; with water at rooftop level in tiny town of Reed. He said damaged estimates ran as high as $61 million in that part of western Kentucky where hundreds have been driven from their homes.</p>
<p>Henderson itself, a town of nearly 26,000 across the river from Evansville, is situated on a rise and not threatened. The city escaped even the devastating flood of 1937 -- the worst on record in the valley -- and its motto is &quot;On the Ohio but Never In It.&quot;</p>
<p>At Smithland, Ky., a village of 300 people near where the Cumberland River flows into the Ohio, sandbagging operations were under way around the clock.</p>
<p>Nearby Paducah, Ky., however, remained dry behind an earthen levy and 30 floodgates that had been put up in recent days.</p>
<p>&quot;It's slowly going down,&quot; said a public information officer for the corps of engineers. &quot;Unlike most floods it's passing very slowly. And we're really happy about the blue skies we're having right now.&quot;</p>
<p>The crest was expected to pass out of the 981-mile (1,579 km) long Ohio Valley Thursday at Cairo, Ill., where the river joins the Mississippi.</p>
<p>Several towns in southern Illinois, where six counties have been declared state disaster areas, also fought steadily rising waters Tuesday.</p>
<p>At Metropolis, Ill., a city park was under water and the river lapped over several blocks. Nearby Fort Massac State Park was submerged but a gambling boat at Metropolis that had been cut off was scheduled to reopen Tuesday after a new walkway was built over the water to allow customers to board.</p>
<p>Upstream at Cincinnati the river officially fell below flood stage at dawn Tuesday, more than 13 feet (3.96 metres) lower than at its peak last Wednesday.</p>
<p>That was cause for celebration on the city's riverfront where most restaurants reopened after a week of lost business. The Anderson Ferry, which crosses the Ohio River between Cincinnati and northern Kentucky, was back in business.</p>
<p>James Witt, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was scheduled to tour several areas in Indiana Tuesday. Damage estimates across the states affected by the flooding have passed $500 million.</p>
<p>More than 30 people have died in flash floods that hit tributaries of the Ohio after more than a foot of rain fell on March 1 and in the ensuing high water.</p>
