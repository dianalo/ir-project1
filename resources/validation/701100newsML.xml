<p>Day 10 snippets from the Wimbledon championships:</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Quote of the day - &quot;The one thing I do know is that I'm not going to name my kid Tim. I hate that name,&quot; said Dutchman Richard Krajicek after Tim Henman became the first British man to defeat a defending Wimbledon champion since Roger Taylor beat Rod Laver in 1970.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Stat of the day - 1961. The last time two British male representatives were in the last eight at Wimbledon. Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski won their fourth round matches to book places in Thursday's quarter-finals.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Oddly enough: Bookmakers now offer only 9-4 against  a British winner at Wimbledon this year. Two years ago, they were offering 1000-1 for such an achievement.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Babes in the woods: One of the two 16-year-olds in the women's singles semifinals are guaranteed a place in the record books as the youngest Wimbledon finalist in the Open era. Top seed Martina Hingis and world number 42 Anna Kournikova will meet in the semifinals. Steffi Graf was the previous youngest finalist in 1987 (corrects from 1988), when at 18 (corrects from 19) she lifted the title.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Movers and shakers: Jana Novotna will move to number two in the women's singles world rankings following her straight sets victory over Indonesia's Yayuk Basuki in the quarter-finals. Her previous highest ranking was three, which she reached late last year. Monica Seles, a surprise third round loser, will move from four to three after Iva Majoli's quarter-final loss.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Former U.S. president George Bush and his wife Barbara were among the VIPs in the Royal Box, but there was not an American in sight. With Mary Joe Fernandez's exit in the last 16, the United States was left with no players in the women's tournament. Sampras was the sole U.S. survivor in the men's draw and he was playing on court one.</p>
