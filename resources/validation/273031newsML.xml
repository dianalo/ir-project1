<p>Guatemala sent a 400-page plan to international donors over the weekend, outlining the billions of dollars it sought for post-war social programs.</p>
<p>&quot;This peace program is the opportunity for Guatemala,&quot; said Economy Minister Juan Mauricio Wurmser, stressing the word &quot;The&quot; in an interview with Reuters.</p>
<p>The action plans will cost $2.5 billion over four years -- a staggering amount considering the country's gross domestic product was $14 billion in 1995.  </p>
<p>The programs are linked to implementation of 11 peace accords drawn up during five years of negotiations between the government and leftist guerrilla rebels to bring an end to 36 years of civil war in which an estimated 140,000 Guatemalans died.</p>
<p>The peace accords go into effect Sunday when the government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG) plan to sign a historic, definitive peace treaty.</p>
<p>Guatemala is the largest and wealthiest country in Central America but the war has inhibited growth and foreign investment and 80 percent of the people live in poverty.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Guatemalan peace process does not just end the war. The state also promises to deal with the causes at the root of the internal armed conflict, which are mostly related to poverty,&quot; Planning Secretary Mariano Rayo told Reuters.</p>
<p>Guatemala has engaged in an intensive publicity campaign to advertise the plan seeking commitments from donor nations for grants, technical assistance, loans and gifts.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein recently visited the United States and Canada promoting the program and Rayo did that in Europe. &quot;Nations that were previously reluctant to work with the Guatemalan government offered us concrete support,&quot; said Rayo.  </p>
<p>Rayo said commitments for $350 million were already in hand from the European Union, Sweden and other countries. He said multilateral institutions had pledged $300 million.</p>
<p>Guatemala plans to contribute 30 percent of the $2.5 billion. To come up with the funds, the government has pledged to improve tax collection and to increase taxes.</p>
<p>Guatemala will present the plan again when representatives meet Jan. 21 in Brussels with a consultative group, coordinated by the Interamerican Development Bank, of European countries, the United States, Canada, South Korea, Japan, Mexico and Argentina as well as multilateral lending institutions.  </p>
<p>The post-war action plan is divided into four main areas. Almost 50 percent will be social spending, mostly for people living in extreme property, including education, health, social security, housing, and women's and Indian programs.</p>
<p>About nine percent of the budget will go to aid for returning refugees and former guerrillas. Guatemala will boost development and job creation with 13 percent of the budget.</p>
<p>The ambitious fourth component is a $693 million modernization of the state to reforms in judiciary, public prosecutors office, army, police, legislature, tax collection system, and local government.</p>
