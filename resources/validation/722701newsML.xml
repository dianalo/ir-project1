<p>Prosecutors have opened a new judicial investigation into allegations that Gaullist Paris mayor Jean Tiberi and his wife illegally received cash from public funds, justice sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>A court annulled an earlier investigation on technical grounds last Friday.</p>
<p>The new probe, involving slightly modified charges, was opened by prosecutors in the southern Paris suburb of Evry, the sources said.</p>
<p>Tiberi, re-elected to parliament last month, had been placed under investigation earlier this year over the payment of 200,000 francs ($33,700) to his wife by the Essonne district council in exchange for a 36-page report on prospects for economic links between Essonne and French-speaking nations.</p>
<p>The report was largely composed of truisms copied from a book and was riddled with spelling mistakes.</p>
<p>Tiberi was alleged to have personally negotiated the payment for his wife with Essonne council leader Xavier Dugoin, a fellow Gaullist. An investigation targeting Dugoin was also dropped as a result of last week's court action.</p>
<p>The court had annulled the investigation at the request of Tiberi's lawyers.</p>
<p>It ruled that an investigating magistrate had used incorrect procedure in seizing the report and had improperly prepared an official account of a search of the mayor's flat, during which the report was found.</p>
<p>Tiberi, who succeeded President and fellow Gaullist Jacques Chirac as the French capital's mayor in 1995, is also the focus of two other inquiries.</p>
<p>One concerns suspected illicit funding of his Gaullist RPR party by the Paris municipal housing authority and the other involves a scandal over the letting of city-owned flats to political associates and relatives at lower than market rents.</p>
<p>Tiberi has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to stay in office. ($ = 5.926 French Francs)</p>
