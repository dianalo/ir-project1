<p>A Palestinian couple refused to let Israeli roadblocks stand in the way of their marriage.</p>
<p>Mahmoud, 35, said he and his bride, Lubnah drove along dusty side roads in the West Bank to evade Israeli checkpoints choking off Palestinian travel between towns and villages.</p>
<p>Israel clamped a closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip after a double suicide bombing in a Jewish market in Jerusalem last week killed 15 people including the attackers.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't postpone the wedding,&quot; said Mahmoud, who declined to give his last name, who travelled 20 km (12 miles) to reach his bride in her village near Ramallah.</p>
<p>&quot;Reaching Kharbatha village and bringing the bride was like a military operation due to all the side roads we took escaping the eyes of Israeli soldiers until we accomplished what we desired,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Palestinians are unable to reach their jobs in Israel, travel abroad or leave their home villages since Israel imposed the closure, which Palestinians have condemned as collective punishment.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I can go for a deep sleep because my son achieved his dream and got married after we triumphed over the military checkpoints,&quot; said Mahmoud's father, Rajeh.</p>
