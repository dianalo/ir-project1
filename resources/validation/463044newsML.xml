<p>Kazakhstan's energy industry sell-off, unprecedented for a former Soviet republic, is raising investors' eyebrows over why so few big oil names are competing for the prime assets.</p>
<p>The latest victor in Kazakhstan's self-styled &quot;sale of the century&quot; is Central Asia Petroleum Ltd, a unit of Indonesia's Setdco Group. On Monday it was named as winner in the race to negotiate for a 60 percent stake in Kazakhstan's largest oil producer, Mangistaumunaigaz.</p>
<p>Analysts said the fact that so many industry minnows were winning energy assets, and that the world's oil majors were often staying away, raised questions over Kazakhstan's vision of the future.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have 'Nobody Oil' coming along and winning, you have to wonder what they've done before,&quot; said Stephen O'Sullivan, oil and gas analyst at MC Securities Ltd in London.</p>
<p>&quot;If these projects are so interesting, why isn't a normal oil major bidding?&quot; he asked. &quot;In Russia, it's the Exxons and Mobils that give a project its seal of approval.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Central Asia Petroleum has won the exclusive right to negotiate a contract with us,&quot; said Maksutbek Rakhanov, first deputy chairman of Kazakhstan's state privatisation committee.</p>
<p>The company beat five others -- Oryx Energy Co and K&amp;B of the United States, Vitol-Kazakhstan (a joint venture with Dutch oil trader and refiner Vitol), Neft S.A. of Russia and Kazakhstan's ZAO Mangistaumunaigaz -- for Mangistaumunaigaz. It promised a hefty $248 million bonus to the government.</p>
<p>Recent winners of Kazakh energy companies include Calgary-based Triton-Vuko Energy Group Ltd, which won a 94.5 percent stake in sickly oil producer Karazhanbasmunai, which boasts 85 million tonnes of oil reserves and another 225 million tonnes of estimated reserves.</p>
<p>Oil executives in Almaty point to a lack of transparency in the privatisation process, despite government promises last autumn to improve the sales.</p>
<p>&quot;They're (Kazakhstan) trying to improve the transparency thing,&quot; said one analyst. &quot;A lot of companies got burned when they found they were landed with much bigger debts than the government had let on.&quot;</p>
<p>The troubled Mangistaumunaigaz oil producer, near Kazakhstan's Caspian Sea coast, accounts for one third of Kazakh oil production. It produced six million tonnes of oil (120,000 barrels per day) and 1.8 billion cubic metres of gas in 1995.</p>
<p>Rakhanov said the enterprise sits on 201 million tonnes of proven oil reserves.</p>
<p>Along with the bonus, Rakhanov said Central Asia Petroleum had drawn up a five-year, $1.5-$2.0 billion investment programme and agreed to meet part of the company's $100 million debts.</p>
<p>Some analysts have said Almaty is selling its treasures to boutique-style energy companies.</p>
<p>But Charles Towers-Clark, analyst at Almaty-based brokers Global Kazkommerts Securities Inc, said of the Mangistaumunaigaz deal: &quot;This sale is a real indication of the government's commitment to privatisation.&quot;</p>
<p>Still, a recent shake-up in the Central Asian state's oil structures and a threat by President Nursultan Nazarbayev to sack his reformist prime minister have sent jitters through the investment community.</p>
<p>The Soviet-era heads of the republic's oil enterprises -- the powerful &quot;oil barons&quot; -- have dragged their heels over the fast-paced sell-off. Many investors and officials, albeit privately, say corruption also remains a big problem.</p>
<p>Privatisation officials said a tender to sell a stake in Embamunaigaz, the Central Asian state's fourth largest oil enterprise, would be announced shortly.</p>
<p>Towers-Clark said Embamunaigaz's 1996 crude oil production was 12.68 million barrels (253,600 barrels per day, or bpd), up from 11.97 million barrels (239,400 bpd) in 1995. It is expected to produce 12.81 million barrels (256,200 bpd) this year. He put proven reserves at 507 million barrels.</p>
