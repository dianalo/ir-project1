<title>FRANCE: Netanyahu accepts active French Middle East role.</title>
<headline>Netanyahu accepts active French Middle East role.</headline>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an interview published on Thursday he accepted France's efforts to play a more active role in Middle East peacemaking.</p>
<p>The hardline Israeli leader, due to visit Paris next week, told the French magazine Valeurs Actuelles he was not sure the European Union had a coherent foreign policy or understood the dangers which the creation of a Palestinian state would imply.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, whose opposition to trading occupied Arab land for peace has been criticised by France, said he did not believe President Jacques Chirac's policy was &quot;aimed exclusively towards the Arab countries to the detriment of other countries&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to me that France simply wants to play an active role in the region, commensurate with its real importance. That is a healthy and normal ambition,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chirac, who will meet Netanyahu next Wednesday and tour the Middle East next month, has sought a bigger role for Paris alongside the United States in the peace process.</p>
<p>He sent his foreign minister to the region in April to help negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanese Hizbollah guerrillas, using France's good contacts with Syria and Iran.</p>
<p>The French Foreign Ministry said on Thursday it had reassured Israel about suspicious Syrian troop movements in southern Lebanon, boasting that its intelligence network had concluded the movements were a routine redeployment.</p>
<p>Asked about EU support for Palestinian self-determination, Netanyahu said: &quot;I am not sure the European Union has really got a fully thought-out or coherent common foreign policy so far.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not know either whether the EU has understood all the implications of the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state. Such a state would control Israel's water resources and airspace, could invite the armed forces of Arab states or Islamic extremists on to its territory, could continue to formulate extremist demands towards the State of Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who will tour Britain, France and Germany next week, said it would not be logical for the Europeans to be more categorical about the final shape of peace than the parties involved in negotiations.</p>
