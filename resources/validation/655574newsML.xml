<p>Former Springbok and Western Province lock Nico Wegner is hoping to resurrect a once-burgeoning career when he makes his debut for Natal against the British Lions at Kings Park this Saturday.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old Wegner, who signed a one-year contract with his new province last week, also completes a full circle in his rugby development with Kings Park and Natal coach Ian McIntosh.</p>
<p>The towering 2.02 metre lock forward made his provincial debut for Western Province in 1992 and earned his first international honours at Kings Park in the second test against France in 1993.</p>
<p>Wegner and fellow lock Hannes Strydom came into that Springbok side for the axed Kobus Wiese and Rudi Visagie and Wegner went on to play three tests for South Africa under McIntosh's coaching against Australia later the same year.</p>
<p>However, although he toured Argentina with the Springboks in late 1993 and was flown out to New Zealand as a tour replacement in 1994, he never added to his five South African test caps.</p>
<p>Worse still, he lost his place in the Western Province side to the likes of Louis Blom, Fritz van Heerden and Hottie Louw and the arrival of Phillip Schutte in Cape Town from Johannesburg early this season was the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>&quot;The last three years have been disappointing for me...(but) I'm just so pleased to be linked with the Currie Cup champions now. I see this as a new lease of life and I want to go all out and make it,&quot; Wegner told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>McIntosh and his former Western Province coach Alan Zondagh both said they believed he could succeed.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the biggest thing is that he's got the potential, otherwise he would never have been picked for South Africa in the first place,&quot; said McIntosh.</p>
<p>Zondagh said Wegner had very good general skills for a forward and that his lineout work had improved a lot in recent years, adding: &quot;He can also move around the field -- he's no slouch.&quot;</p>
