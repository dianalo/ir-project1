<p>German Farm Minister Jochen Borchert said on Monday that the only cows to fall ill with mad cow disease in the country were imported and insisted Germany was still free of the disease.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still no original cases of BSE in Germany,&quot; Borchert said in a statement.</p>
<p>Borchert's comments came after the weekly magazine Focus said European Union farm commissioner Franz Fischler had sent Borchert a confidential letter saying that infected animal feed might be being imported into Germany from Britain.</p>
<p>But Borchert said he had received no such letter and there was no evidence that feed was being illegally imported into Germany from Britain, either directly or via other countries.</p>
<p>It has been illegal to import animal feed into Germany from Britain since 1989.</p>
<p>New fears about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, were sparked in Germany last month after officials said they thought they had found the first German-born cow to die of the disease.</p>
<p>The discovery of the cow, thought to have been infected by its British mother, prompted federal and state agriculture ministries to agree to slaughter over 5,000 cattle from Britain and Switzerland -- the countries with the most native BSE cases.</p>
<p>The cow was the fifth to die of the disease in Germany.</p>
<p>But the origin of the cow was later cast into doubt, causing farmers to protest against the mass slaughter and consumer organisations to accuse Bonn of not exerting sufficient control over the import of animals and feed.</p>
<p>Genetic tests on the cow should be completed next month. If it is shown to have been infected by its mother then officials could order the slaughter of around 12,000 offspring of imported cattle.</p>
<p>Borchert also called upon the European Commission to publish a report on the BSE-status of member states immediately to allow any necessary action to be taken.</p>
