<p>The return of Japanese players after a long weekend did little to shake SIMEX Euroyen and Eurodollar futures out of their apathetic state on Tuesday as the market held its breath for the Federal Reserve meeting.</p>
<p>Even the release of Japan's July index of leading and coincident indicators was shrugged off as the data were within expectations, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the market had largely discounted a 25-basis-point increase to the U.S. federal funds rate, the benchmark for overnight loans between banks.  </p>
<p>&quot;If it's unchanged to 25 basis points, it won't have much impact,&quot; said a dealer with an Asian futures house, adding that the March Eurodollar contract would lose five to seven ticks at most if the Fed's move was within expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;But if they hike by 50 basis points, we'd see quite a drastic selldown,&quot; he said, adding that March Eurodollars could then come off to 93.75.</p>
<p>The contract ended unchanged against its IMM close at 93.89. March Euroyen finished at 99.18 against 99.17 in Chicago while Japanese government bond futures for December settled at 122.10 against their opening 121.97.  </p>
