<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures ended higher on Tuesday as late buying of blue chip issues boosted the underlying cash market, but dealers said further gains were likely to be slow.</p>
<p>The benchmark Nikkei 225 March contract added 275 points to close 10 points off its intra-day high of 19,150.</p>
<p>&quot;It's mainly speculative buying and selling now. I think most people have just squared up ahead of the Japanese financial year end,&quot; said a trader with a local futures house.  </p>
<p>He said the March Nikkei showed more room on the upside technically, but it would need to break above a stubborn barrier around 19,200 to head higher.</p>
<p>On the downside, a breach of the 18,800 level would cause the contract to come off further, he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the results of a 10-year Japanese government bond auction had little impact on the Nikkei as they left the bond market largely unmoved.</p>
<p>The March MSCI Taiwan stock index ended at 327.6 against its opening 329.5 on volume of 627 lots.</p>
