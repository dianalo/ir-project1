<p>Bank Handlowy wants its privatisation to attract top institutions who will lift the bank's international profile and lots of local investors to keep its Polish character, Handlowy's president said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The government-approved privatisation scheme for Poland's flagship bank, set for mid-year, assumes that equal 30 percent share batches will be earmarked for a closed institutional offer, a public offering and funds to be created under a reform of the pension system.</p>
<p>Five percent stakes will be reserved for Handlowy's employees and for a government plan to compensate former owners of property confiscated under communism.</p>
<p>Handlowy's president Cezary Stypulkowski told Reuters that, by offering stakes of 5-7 percent to a narrow group of quality long-term investors, Handlowy hoped to gain better access to know-how, international markets and clients.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect that it will be a diversified group of quality institutions, which will safeguard some transfer of technology and know-how to the bank,&quot; Stypulkowski said in an interview.</p>
<p>He said such partners would help Handlowy, Poland's leader in corporate banking and trade finance, to compete better for international clients with foreign banks operating in Poland.</p>
<p>At the same time the sell-off plan, which the bank wants to put to work with the help of its advisor Schroders, aims to maintain the Polish character of the 126-year-old institution.</p>
<p>Therefore the public offer, open to both foreign and domestic investors, would focus on the local retail player.</p>
<p>&quot;We will strive to address the public offer in the first place to domestic retail investors...because we are in a sense a symbolic institution,&quot; Stypulkowski said.</p>
<p>He said the bank wanted to find long-term investors before the public offer planned for the summer months but did not rule out the possibility that the flotation might come first.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the tight schedule...we might decide to bring in the group of stable investors after the offering,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said he was confident Handlowy, well positioned in one of the fastest-growing European markets and showing a strong earnings record, should arouse enough foreign demand.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no doubts that on international markets the bank will sell, we are a quality name...I'd say there are few institutions in Eastern Europe of such quality,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Preliminary 1996 results showed the bank, with a capital of 1.85 billion zlotys ($630 million), earned net 555 million zlotys on a balance sheet total of 13.3 billion zlotys.</p>
<p>Stypulkowski saw little threat from other large flotations this year, such as the KGHM copper concern offer, because of an increase in international demand for East European issues.</p>
<p>The bigger challenge would be to sell a substantial chunk of the large public offer on the shallow local market, he said.</p>
<p>Banking analysts estimated that Handlowy, priced as listed banks at about twice its book value, would be worth about five billion zlotys, making its public offer Poland's biggest ever.</p>
<p>Stypulkowski said the bank was working on incentives for local investors, which would have a &quot;financial dimension&quot;.</p>
<p>Asked about the 30 percent stake that will remain with the state treasury for future pension funds, he said the bank did not want investors to fear excessive treasury influence.</p>
<p>&quot;We have several options but given that those funds do not exist, investors must have assurances the state treasury will not have a dominant role in the bank's management,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Stypulkowski said Handlowy would remain mostly active in its core corporate banking business but was poised to expand into such areas as asset management and investment banking. ($1=2.9400 Zloty)</p>
