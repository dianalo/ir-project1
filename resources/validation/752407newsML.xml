<p>Amid singing and clapping, thousands gathered in central Johannesburg to launch a two billion rand ($440 million) project to claw back the city centre from the ravages of crime and grime.</p>
<p>The sun shone and the city's great and good made impassioned speeches to try to stop the flight of businesses from the increasingly mean downtown streets.</p>
<p>The task will not be easy.</p>
<p>The launch on July 17 was notable not only for its upbeat mood, but for a heavy phalanx of security guards and walk-through metal detectors, underlining the notorious security risks in downtown Johannesburg.</p>
<p>&quot;Our presence here today is to breathe new life into the central business district of this great city...we want to see this city continue to thrive as the economic capital of our country,&quot; said Tokyo Sexwale, premier of the industrialised and populous Gauteng province in which Johannesburg lies.</p>
<p>BUSINESSES LEAVE CENTRES IN FACE OF CRIME, GRIME</p>
<p>Many businesses have already passed judgment on the prospects of Johannesburg's central business district and those of other South African cities such as Pretoria, Port Elizabeth and Durban.</p>
<p>They have voted with their feet.</p>
<p>The city centre property market was rocked earlier this year when Sanlam, the country's biggest property investor, announced it was freezing all central business district (CBD) investment across the country until the crime problem was tackled.</p>
<p>The news was followed by an announcement from Anglo American Property Services (Ampros) that it was restructuring three of its listed units in a move that would see it sell off 300 million rand of CBD property.</p>
<p>The firm said the decision was taken after the CBD properties depreciated by about 340 million rand over the last two years because of increasing vacancies and lower rentals.</p>
<p>&quot;The investment community would say it is the right thing to do. This wasn't an emotional decision to leave the CBD, it was a commercial one,&quot; said Pierro Farina, a managing director at Ampros unit Anglo American Property Ltd (Amaprop).</p>
<p>The main reason for the flight is crime as CBDs become a haven for muggers and car thieves, but traffic-clogged roads and litter-strewn pavements jammed with street traders have also played a role in pushing business out.</p>
<p>A pulling factor has been the rapid growth of out-of-centre business parks, flooding the market with cheap deals.</p>
<p>Latest quarterly figures from the South African Property Owners' Association show that the flight is continuing.</p>
<p>Johannesburg's CBD vacancy rate has risen to 18.2 percent in the three months to May from 16.1 percent in the previous period. In Durban the number rose to 14.2 percent from 11.6 percent.</p>
<p>Only Cape Town, with its reputation for easy living and lower crime rates, has escaped the CBD problem.</p>
<p>SOME OPTIMISM FOR FUTURE, JOHANNESBURG PROJECT HAILED</p>
<p>But some property industry figures are becoming cautiously optimistic about the future and hailed the Johannesburg CBD revitalisation scheme.</p>
<p>Dubbed Mayivuke (Zulu for &quot;let it rise&quot;), the scheme will create a metropolitan police force by next year to aid the national police in urban crime prevention.</p>
<p>Eight million rand has been earmarked to build eight shelters to house the city's 7,000 homeless and 200 million rand to revamp Johannesburg central railway station.</p>
<p>A 600-bed hostel is to be built to accommodate informal traders who have got used to braving the night on the CBD's pavement, to wake up and sell their goods the next morning.</p>
<p>&quot;It is ambitious. It has got our full support and if it can be done we must put all our work behind it,&quot; said Fanie Lategan, general manager of asset management at Sanlam Properties.</p>
<p>The project won vocal backing from local banks ABSA Ltd and Standard Bank Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;ABSA strongly believes that crime will decline and that the environment in which we operate will improve,&quot; said Alwyn Noeth, ABSA group executive director.</p>
<p>Many people say there is simply too much capital invested in the country's CBDs to allow them to become commercial deserts. &quot;There is so much money invested in CBDs (that) no one can afford to walk away from them entirely,&quot; Lategan said.</p>
<p>Standard Bank has 650 million rand tied up in Johannesburg's CBD and ABSA is committed to a seven-storey development there worth 400 million rand.</p>
<p>CBD RENTS HIT BOTTOM, FOREIGNERS SHOW INTEREST</p>
<p>Another cause for optimism is that many believe rents for formerly top of the range and enviably located offices are becoming so cheap they lure people back.</p>
<p>Just like a share trader buying as the market slides, so many businesses will want to snap up prime locations in the hope things will pick up soon.</p>
<p>Certainly foreign investors are moving in. On July 17 the mainly black investment firm Magic Kingdom Holdings announced plans to build a huge entertainment and shopping resort in central Pretoria.</p>
<p>The City Lake project, to be financed mainly by Malaysia's Genting Bhd, will involve the creation of an artificial lake bordered by a hotel, casino resort and shopping complex.</p>
<p>One argument runs that the travails suffered by CBDs are just a reaction to the enormous social changes in post-apartheid South Africa as the country becomes less white-dominated and &quot;We have to accept to a certain degree that our CBDs are turning into different CBDs than what we are used to. The Johannesburg CBD looks like Nairobi. We should not compare it with cities in the United States or London,&quot; said Francois Viruly, head of research at JHI Property Services.</p>
<p>&quot;I am optimistic, but I don't believe things will settle overnight,&quot; he said. &quot;That is not for tomorrow. It will take years.&quot; ($1=4.56 RAND)</p>
