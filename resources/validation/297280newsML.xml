<p>More than 1,000 displaced Turkish Kurds have left a U.N. camp in northern Iraq and taken refuge among Kurdish rebels, a news agency close to the guerrillas said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;More than a thousand...have set off for areas under the control of (Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK) guerrillas,&quot; the Germany-based DEM news agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>It did not say whether the refugees were headed for Turkey or other areas of northern Iraq where the rebels have bases.</p>
<p>A senior Turkish security official on Thursday reiterated an invitation for the refugees to return to Turkey from the Atrush camp, adding that more than 100 families had already accepted the offer, state-run Anatolian news agency reported.</p>
<p>Atrush was set up in 1994 for Kurds fleeing into northern Iraq from southeast Turkey, where villagers are caught in the middle of fighting between Turkish troops and the PKK.</p>
<p>More than 21,000 people have died in the 12-year-old conflict.</p>
<p>The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR announced on December 21 that it would phase out its operations at Atrush in a month because of rebel activities in the camp.</p>
<p>Necati Bilican, the governor of Turkey's emergency rule region, told Anatolian the camp would be empty within a month. He said 121 families have returned to Turkey from the camp, situated 60 km (38 miles) from the Turkish border. It housed about 14,000 refugees at its peak.</p>
<p>Ankara has made housing and aid arrangements for those returning to Turkey, the regional governor said, but added that nobody would be forced to return.</p>
<p>UNHCR chief Sadako Ogata said in December the agency would assist those refugees who chose to stay in northern Iraq.</p>
