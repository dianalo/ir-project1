<p>Serb, Croat and Moslem members of Bosnia's newly elected collective presidency met on Monday for the first time at a motel on the outskirts of Sarajevo, officials said.</p>
<p>The three men, all war time leaders and one-time enemies, convened at 4:20 p.m. (1420 GMT) in a small austere room on the first floor of of the &quot;Saraj&quot; Motel at the eastern edge of the city centre, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;President Izetbegovic, Mr Krajisnik and Mr Zubak are talking alone at the moment in one of the hotel rooms there,&quot; Michael Maclay, spokesman for the International High Representative, said.</p>
<p>&quot;They've been left entirely alone, there are no aides and supports, no members of the international community there to talk to them. They are starting the first meeting of what is going to be the supreme authority in this country,&quot; Maclay said.</p>
<p>&quot;The atmosphere was good and workmanlike. They chatted for a little bit beforehand, and they sat down. Everyone else left the room and what is being said now is between the three of them and no one else.&quot;</p>
<p>The High Representative Carl Bildt and his deputy, Michael Steiner, attended the start of the talks, but left soon after, Maclay said.</p>
<p>Bildt said all three former foes shook hands to open the session.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a good sign for the future that the new presidency could meet in Sarajevo less than 24 hours after the election results had been certified yesterday,&quot; Bild said in a statement.</p>
<p>In comments to reporters, Bildt also said he had provided an agenda for their discussions, which included procedural questions about establishing other joint institutions.</p>
<p>But the High Representative cautioned that there was no guarantee that agenda would be followed.</p>
<p>International mediators had struggled for two weeks to broker an agreement over the venue for the first session.</p>
<p>Izetbegovic and Zubak both wanted the meeting in central Sarajevo, but Krajisnik said he did not feel safe there, and wanted to convene the presidency on the boundary line between the Serb republic and the Moslem-Croat federation.</p>
<p>Krajisnik entered the city from the Serb's mountain village headquarters of Pale for the first time since war errupted in April 1992.</p>
<p>Reporters near the motel said Izetbegovic arrived around 4 p.m. (1400 GMT), one hour after the Croat representative Kresimir Zubak and 45 minutes after the Serb presidency member Momcilo Krajisnik. It was not clear why he was late.</p>
<p>Security services had thrown a tight cordon around the building. Reporters said they blocked all traffic and pedestrians from moving within half a kilometre (500 yards) of the motel and towed any parked cars away.</p>
<p>The presidency, charged with governing a union of Serb and Moslem-Croat territories, was chosen in Bosnia's first post-war general election on September 14.</p>
<p>Alija Izetbegovic, a Moslem, won most votes in the presidential race and will serve as the body's chairman for a two-year term.</p>
<p>Izetbegovic narrowly defeated Krajisnik, his sworn enemy during 3-1/2 years of war, for the chairman's post.</p>
<p>Krajisnik had said earlier he did not feel safe meeting in the city centre and wanted the presidency to convene on the boundary line between the Serb republic and the Moslem-Croat federation. But Western governments and Izetbegovic dismissed Krajisnik's proposal as a violation of the spirit of the Dayton peace agreement which ended the Bosnian war.  </p>
<p>The trio met on their own without aides or international mediators in a small first-floor room at the Saraj Motel, according to the international High Representative Carl Bildt who witnessed the start of the talks.</p>
<p>There was no indication of what the three leaders discussed, although Bildt earlier said he had offered them an agenda which included procedural questions about establishing other joint institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;It's their country. It's their future, and I think they are discussing that. That's the way it should be,&quot; Bildt told reporters. &quot;They are assuming authority over the country and the fact that they are doing this within 24 hours of certification of election results -- I think its a good sign,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bildt also said the international community expected the inauguration ceremony for the elected members of the national House of Representatives and Parliamentary assembly to take place in Sarajevo within the next 10 days.</p>
