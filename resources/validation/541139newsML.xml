<headline>Singapore untraded, anxiety mounts over Goodyear.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-04-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Trading in the Singapore rubber market remained listless by the midday break on Friday while anxiety mounted because of the unresolved strike at Goodyear Tire, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There were no requests for offers this morning. The strike in Goodyear is not over. That's making some people nervous out here,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Another dealer said the possible sale next week by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has forced some players in the market to retreat to the sidelines.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's very little business being done at the moment,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;People are waiting for the DLA because we understand it should take place next week.&quot;</p>
<p>One trader said the market was still being hounded by weak consumer demand.</p>
<p>At around 0445 GMT, June RSS3 was indicated at 106.25 U.S. cents a kg from 106.75 cents. June RSS1 was indicated at 154.00-156.00 Singapore cents (US$1.07-$1.08) a kg from 154.25 cents. June TSR20 was indicated at 147.00-149.00 Singapore cents (US$1.02-1.03) a kg from 148.75 cents.</p>
