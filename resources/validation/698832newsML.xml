<p>PALM OIL FUTURES - The market reversed an early downtrend to close higher on refiners' covering and cash market buying. Caleb Brett's June export estimates had no impact on prices, which fell sharply earlier due to weak soyoil on bearish USDA report. Sept rebounded and the next resistance is at 1,175.</p>
<p>PALM OIL PHYSICALS - Also recovered on refiners' support and and interest was seen among CPOs and products.  </p>
<p>The morning fall was overdone and the afternoon rise was a technical correction to recent losses, traders said.</p>
<p>At the close, the September futures recovered five ringgit to 1,162 ringgit ($460.38) a kg after falling to a low of 1,142 ringgit earlier.</p>
