<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing debt market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-07-07</dateline>

<p>Dutch bonds closed firmer, tracking the uptrend in other debt markets but dealers said trade was thin with very little institutional buying of cash bonds to support the rise in prices.</p>
<p>Guilder bonds underperformed Germany again, leading to a further tightening of yield spreads but opinions differed as to the cause of this.</p>
<p>Some dealers spoke of renewed confidence in Europe's single currency project, saying this would inevitably bring greater convergence in bond yields as the 1999 launch date approached.  </p>
<p>Others put the tighter yield Dutch-German spreads down to Dutch investors switching out of their own market and into Germany to take advantage of the yield pickup.</p>
<p>The fact that the new 30-year Germany bond could be stripped to allow separate trading of principal and interest coupons also contributed to the narrowing of the yield gap at the long end.</p>
<p>Some dealers said Dutch institutions had been holding out for 10-year yields of six percent but would have to invest some of their accumulated cash soon and that this flow of funds could drive down yields to 5.25 percent from just below 5.50 now.  </p>
<p>Others felt the bond market was out of touch with fundamentals and that current yield levels were already unsustainable.</p>
<p>&quot;The market keeps going up, but institutions aren't buying, so it will come off quite sharply when the professionals say goodbye to their long positions,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
