<p>A mysterious explosion early on Friday which damaged the Stockholm stadium which hosted the 1912 Olympics was not connected to the city's bid to host the 2004 Games, a campaign official said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no evidence that the explosion in the 1912 Stockholm Stadium has anything to do with the current Olympic bid,&quot; said Olof Stenhammar, president of the Stockholm bid committee.</p>
<p>Residents in the inner Stockholm neighbourhood where the stadium is located were woken up by an explosion at about 1.00 am local time (2300 GMT), police inspector Harreet Leeftam said.</p>
<p>Police on a routine patrol in the area arrived at the stadium almost immediately and searched the area with dogs, but no suspects were found, she said.</p>
<p>No injuries were reported from the explosion, which left a gaping hole in the roof above the main entrance on the eastern side of the arena.</p>
<p>Most heavily damaged were the stadium public address booth and press boxes, police spokesman Claes Cassel said.</p>
<p>The police had no leads, he said.</p>
<p>By early afternoon, maintenance men closed off the stadium where some of athletics' biggest stars have set world records.</p>
<p>Glass littered the stadium's all-weather track. Tiles blown off the roof were strewn across the pavement inside the stadium gate.</p>
<p>Security at the stadium is minimal with only a 1.5-metre (five ft) wrought-iron fence for protection.</p>
<p>If Stockholm wins the 2004 Games, the stadium is scheduled to be used for some equestrian and modern pentathlon events but not as the main arena.</p>
<p>Arsonists have struck seven sports venues in Stockholm since May.</p>
<p>All the fires, which police believe may be connected, have occurred at night but Cassel said no person or group has claimed responsibility for any of the fires.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been absolute silence,&quot; he said. &quot;If the person or persons responsible have a special aim, it's most likely they would tell in some way. Since they haven't done this, you wonder what is going on.&quot;</p>
<p>Stockholm is competing with Athens, Buenos Aires, Cape Town and Rome to stage the 2004 Olympics. The decision will be made on September 5.</p>
