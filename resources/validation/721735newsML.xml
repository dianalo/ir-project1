<headline>Unions, BA scramble for talks as strike ends.</headline>

<p>A mood of reconciliation crept into the last full day of a three-day strike by British Airways cabin crew as management and unions edged towards talks to head off further walkouts.</p>
<p>With the 72-hour strike due to end early on Saturday, both sides claimed a moral victory while seizing a chance to regroup and hold further talks over the weekend.</p>
<p>Hundreds of flights and thousands of passengers have been stranded by the cabin crew strike, which started on Wednesday morning, despite BA's claims that it was being increasingly successful in keeping flights running.</p>
<p>Delays and cancellations will spill over into flights on Saturday. The cost to the airline is likely to run into hundreds of millions of pounds (dollars), union officials claim.</p>
<p>The cabin crew strike is over a drive by the airline to restructure terms and conditions and to save 42 million pounds ($70.9 million) as part of a massive financial overhaul.</p>
<p>A compromise deal on the package seemed within reach.</p>
<p>&quot;We are encouraged that (the cabin crew unions) have accepted the need for 42 million pound savings and the need for restructuring pay,&quot; BA director of operations Mike Street told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;These are very positive signs.&quot;</p>
<p>BA said it would evaluate the union's alternative proposals to achieve the savings, ahead of talks.</p>
<p>T&amp;G aviation officer George Ryde said he was planning to discuss the savings plans with the main cabin crew union, BASSA.</p>
<p>But he warned there would be no talks if any strikers were suspended when the action ends on Saturday.</p>
<p>Talks were also expected on a separate dispute over the sale of BA's catering operation at Heathrow airport.</p>
<p>Bill Morris, the leader of the Transport and General Workers Union (T&amp;G), took the initiative by calling on Friday morning for a &quot;pause for peace&quot; in a high-stakes conflict which observers say may set the pattern for industrial disputes under the new Labour government.</p>
<p>&quot;We are inviting the airline to come along with us to explore all the options to find a sensible and long lasting resolution to the problems we face,&quot; Morris said.</p>
<p>The unions tightened the screw on Thursday night when catering staff rejected company proposals in a dispute over the sale of a BA catering unit.</p>
<p>The catering union meets on Monday to decide whether to call its own 24-hour strike, which may include check-in staff and baggage handlers. Talks between the company and the catering union got under way on Friday.</p>
<p>Strikes over the peak summer season by cabin crew and ground staff would cripple the airline's operations.</p>
<p>Earlier the BA board gave full backing to Ayling, who was attacked on Thursday by Trades Unions Congress leader John Monks for alleged intimidation of BA staff in the dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;Each member of the Board has expressed their full support for the chief executive and his management team in their efforts to secure the business efficiencies we need to safeguard the future of this company,&quot; BA chairman Sir Colin Marshall said in a statement.</p>
<p>Union leaders and left-wing Labour members of parliament accused Ayling's management of intimidating staff by threatening them with loss of travel perks, promotion prospects and of taking legal action.</p>
<p>BA rejects the charge. ($ = 0.592 British Pounds)</p>
