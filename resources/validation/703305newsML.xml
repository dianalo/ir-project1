<p>The governor (chairman) of Bank of Ireland, Howard Kilroy, on Wednesday announced the appointment of Maurice Keane as group chief executive-designate to replace Pay Molloy, who retires in January, 1988.</p>
<p>Keane is currently deputy group chief executive.</p>
<p>&quot;Since his appointment as group chief executive in 1991, he (Molloy) has overseen a remarkable recovery in the fortunes of the group, many significant initiatives to re-position, grow and internationalise the business, numerous innovations in product delivery and design and, most importantly, strong growth in profits, earnings per share and returns to...stockholders,&quot; Kilroy told the annual meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;He has agreed to remain...as a non-executive director and he will retain a further important association with the group through his chairmanship of Bristol &amp; West, which he will assume at year end.&quot;</p>
<p>Kilroy said Keane had been a central force in the Group's senior management team for many years.</p>
<p>&quot;His banking skills command respect both within Bank of Ireland and throughout the industry,&quot; he said.</p>
