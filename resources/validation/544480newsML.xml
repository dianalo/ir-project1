<p>A new oil berth officially opened on Monday will help rationalise Colombo port activities and land use and enhance safety, Sri Lanka Ports Authority chairman Ranjit Wickramasinghe said.</p>
<p>&quot;Colombo has emerged as an important hub port,&quot; he said in a speech at the opening ceremony. &quot;The release of quay space for cargo is important for the development of the port.&quot;</p>
<p>The new facility has nine piplines, laid by NKK Corp of Japan, for loading and discharging a range of products such as crude oil, fuel oil, gas oil, naphtha, bunker fuel and liquid petroleum gas.</p>
<p>The oil berth, which has a dredged depth of 14 metres and can handle ships of up to 60,000 tonnes, was built by Penta-Ocean/Wakachiku Joint Venture, contractors for the port's Jaye Container Terminal.</p>
<p>The facility, relocated to the Island Breakwater from its original location on the North Pier, was designed by Japan Port Consultants Tokyo, consultants for the Japanese government-funded development of the port since 1980.</p>
<p>Wickramasinghe said most of the 2.2-billion-rupee ($37-million) cost of the facility, which will also enable exports by the state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corp, was met by a Japanese soft loan.</p>
<p>Colombo port, which handled a record 1.4 million containers last year, up 29 percent from 1995, is planning to deepen its northern entrance as well as the harbour basin to take new generation container ships, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have reached almost 90 percent of our capacity,&quot; Wickramasinghe said. &quot;We're also planning to build a new south port of Colombo and we're building berths at Galle and Trincomalee to ease congestion at Colombo caused by traditional cargo.&quot;</p>
<p>Colombo port, south Asia's transshipment hub, is seen nearing its capacity of 1.6 million units this year.</p>
<p>Trans-shipment traffic accounts for about 70 percent of the port's throughput. Trans-shipment occurs when a vessel discharges cargo at an intermediate port and the goods are loaded onto another ship bound for the final destination.</p>
