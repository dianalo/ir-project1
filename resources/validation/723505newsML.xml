<p>Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine has acknowledged that France is isolated, even from Germany, in its drive for a European defence, according to parliamentary minutes released on Friday.</p>
<p>Reporting to the National Assembly's foreign affairs and defence committees on this week's Madrid NATO summit, Vedrine said on Thursday: &quot;As far as the European defence identity is concerned, one cannot hide from reality.</p>
<p>&quot;The 28 (neutral and ex-communist) partners who took part in the Madrid summit have only one idea: moving closer to NATO which in their eyes is synonymous with modernity and rejoining the international community,&quot; he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;France is alone in carrying the idea of a European defence. Given this difficult context, one cannot neglect what has been achieved: the mechanisms that have been created are complicated but they were achieved after a great struggle, including with countries which are close to us,&quot; Vedrine said.</p>
<p>He said Britain had done everything in its power at last month's Amsterdam European Union summit to block any move to give the EU a greater role in defence and to try to subordinate European defence policy completely to the Atlantic alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;As for Germany, it is concentrating on the euro at the moment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Vedrine's comments were made as angry deputies complained that the United States had imposed its agenda on the NATO summit, preventing Romania and Slovenia from joining Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary in the first wave of countries invited to join the alliance, and refusing to hand over NATO's southern European command to a European officer.</p>
<p>The minutes said: &quot;The foreign minister underlined that the issue of enlargement had become essential because of certain events linked to the U.S. presidential campaign, and that the prior decision in favour of three countries -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- had been taken before Madrid.&quot;</p>
<p>Vedrine's testimony contrasted with a warning by conservative French President Jacques Chirac to NATO leaders in Madrid that the alliance would not survive if it did not give a fairer share of responsibility to the European allies.</p>
<p>The Socialist foreign minister agreed with Chirac that a December deadline set by other countries for reforming the alliance's integrated command structure did not apply to France, since it had decided for the moment not to rejoin NATO's military wing.</p>
<p>The Socialist chairmen of both parliamentary committees expressed satisfaction with the French decision, citing with approval president Charles de Gaulle's 1966 decision to quit the integrated command in protest at American domination.</p>
<p>&quot;When France left NATO, it weakened neither its own defence nor that of Europe,&quot; defence committee chairman Paul Quiles said.</p>
<p>The French often refer to De Gaulle's decision as leaving NATO, even though Paris remains in the alliance's political wing and is fully bound by its founding 1949 Treaty of Washington, which includes mutual defence commitments.</p>
<p>Foreign affairs commission chairman Jack Lang said the committee was divided into supporters of De Gaulle and the late president Francois Mitterrand, who did not want to yield to the United States, and supporters of &quot;realpolitik which resigns itself to Atlanticism and acceps the hegemony of the powerful&quot;.</p>
<p>Chirac began a rapprochement with NATO shortly after taking office in 1995. He had concluded that France would never convince its partners to build a European defence outside the alliance.</p>
