<p>China's Moslem region of Xinjiang has vowed to intensify a crackdown on separatists after authorities executed three rioters and fired at a mob trying to rescue the death-row convicts, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our struggle against national separatists and religious extremists is neither an ethnic nor a religious problem. It is a life-or-death struggle between ourselves and the enemy,&quot; Xinjiang Television quoted the region's Communist Party boss, Wang Lequan, as saying.</p>
<p>A summary of his speech was published in Tuesday's edition of the Xinjiang Daily, a newspaper official said by telephone from the regional capital, Urumqi.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a pressing need at present to wage an intensive struggle to improve public order and severely crack down on violent terrorist crimes in key areas,&quot; state television quoted Wang as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;(It is) a struggle between those who safeguard the motherland's unification and ethnic unity and those who split the motherland and undermine ethnic unity,&quot; Wang said.</p>
<p>Wang was speaking after a meeting of regional Communist Party leaders to discuss instructions from Beijing to strengthen stability in restive Xinjiang, the television said.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, Chinese paramilitary police shot dead two people and wounded five in Yining, near Xinjiang's border with Kazakhstan, when a mob of more than 100 tried to rescue convicted rioters from execution, officials said.</p>
<p>Three people were executed and 27 were sentenced to prison terms ranging from seven years to life for their roles in riots in Yining last February.</p>
<p>All 30 defendants were of the Moslem, Turkic-speaking Uighur ethnic minority.</p>
<p>The February riots, which began as a demonstration for Xinjiang independence, left nine people dead and 198 injured.</p>
<p>Wang claimed victory over what he called terrorism.</p>
<p>&quot;We have dealt a powerful blow to the national separatist forces and violent terrorist activities and scored significant victories in our struggle against the enemy and for maintaining social stability,&quot; Wang said.</p>
<p>&quot;The hostile forces have resorted to terrorism to create ethnic contradictions and stir up ethnic hatred, seriously impeding the normal production order and everyday life of society and endangering the safety and lives of the masses,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Uighur militants want to set up an independent &quot;East Turkestan&quot; in Xinjiang, which borders Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states.</p>
<p>In February, bombs planted on three buses blew up within minutes of each other in Urumqi in an apparently coordinated attack that coincided with funeral rites in Beijing for paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>The bombs killed nine people and wounded 74. Police have arrested more than 10 suspected bombers.</p>
<p>Exiled ethnic Uighurs have claimed responsibility for the bombings and vowed to stage more attacks until they gain freedom for their Moslem homeland.</p>
<p>Last year, the region was rocked by assassination attempts on officials and religious leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.</p>
