<p>Appeals in a heroin-trafficking case which shocked the nation are due to open in Hanoi next week, the Tuoi Tre newspaper said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The state-controlled journal said appeals by former police captain Vu Xuan Truong and most of the 21 other defendants sentenced to death or jail last month would run from June 24 until June 30.</p>
<p>Truong and seven others, including police officers and border guards, were sentenced to death for their part in a syndicate which flooded the country with hundreds of kilos of heroin from the notorious opium poppy-growing Golden Triangle region.</p>
<p>Eight people were given life jail terms and six received terms from a suspended sentence to 20 years in jail.</p>
<p>Tuoi Tre did not say whether the appeals were against verdicts or sentences and court officials were not available to comment.</p>
<p>About 20 others who have been arrested in connection with the case are due to go on trial at the Hanoi People's Court soon.</p>
<p>Tuoi Tre said Hanoi's police chief had told reporters on Monday that the life of one of the defendants -- a Laotian drugs trafficker whose death-row confession helped expose Truong and his accomplices -- should be spared.</p>
