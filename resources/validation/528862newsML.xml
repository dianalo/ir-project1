<p>McMoRan Oil &amp; Gas Co said Monday drilling on the North Bay Junop well was completed this month and the well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons in the primary objective zones.</p>
<p>The company also said its drilling program with MCN Energy Group Inc agreed to sell its West Cameron Block 503 interest for $7.2 million, $2.9 million net to MOXY's interst.</p>
<p>MOXY said it will recognize a $2.3 million gain upon the completion of the sale and the proceeds would be used to repay borrowings from MCN. The sale is expected to be completed during the second quarter.  </p>
<p>The company, which has a 25 percent interest in the North Bay Junop exploration venture, said its partners are Freeport- McMoRan Resource Partners LP and Phillips Petroleum Co. The latest well is the second of two high-risk, high-potential prospects which have been drilled within the joint venture's project area in south Louisiana.</p>
<p>The venture is currently reviewing several alternatives regarding shallower potentially productive zones encountered in this well, as well as evaluating other leads within the project area which have been identified by the 3-D seismic survey, MOXY said.  </p>
<p>The company reported a first quarter loss of $2,489,000, $0.18 per share, compared with a loss of $4,330,000, $0.31 per share, for the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>MOXY said its first quarter revenues totaled $2,773,000 and consisted of $2,364,000 from its revenue interest in the Vermilion Block 160 and 410 fields offshore Louisiana and $409,000 of administrative fees received from MCN, pursuant to the MOXY/MCN drilling program.</p>
<p>During the quarter, the 40 percent owned MOXY/MCN program completed drilling of the AJ-3 development well from its Vermilion Block 160 platform.  </p>
<p>The well logged nine gas sands totaling about 262 feet of net pay. Drilling immediately began on an additional well to develop the shallower reserves discovered by the AJ-3 well. After completion of all drilling from the platform, the wells will be completed and could be on stream as early as mid-1997, depending on the number of wells drilled. The MOXY/MCN program has a 28 percent revenue interest in this field unit which is subject to re-determination subsequent to final development drilling. In addition, the MOXY/MCN program's interest in two of the four blocks within the field unit is subject to a 30 percent net profits interest.</p>
<p>Production at the Vermilion Block 410 field is currently more than 80 million cubic feet of natural gas daily. The MOXY/MCN program has a 28 percent revenue interest.</p>
