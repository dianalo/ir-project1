<p>Residents of Okinawa turned out on Sunday to say whether the huge U.S. military presence on the island should be reduced.</p>
<p>The outcome of the referendum is expected to affect not only U.S.-Japanese relations but also the timing of a national general election.</p>
<p>The following are key points about Okinawa, Japan's southernmost prefecture and scene of one of the fiercest battles of World War Two.</p>
<p>POPULATION: 1.27 million, about one percent of Japan's total populace.</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHY: 50 inhabited and 110 uninhabited islands scattered in the Pacific. The largest is Okinawa island, where 20 percent of its land is dominated by U.S. bases. The provincial capital, Naha, is 1,500 km (930 miles) southwest of Tokyo.</p>
<p>HISTORY: The island's geographic isolation from central Japan has allowed Okinawa to develop its own distinct dialect and culture.</p>
<p>Until the establishment of Okinawa Prefecture in 1879, the archipelago was the domain of the Ryukyu Kingdom, which enjoyed prosperity through active trade with China.</p>
<p>The area suffered greatly in the war, especially during the Allied invasion of the island in April 1945.</p>
<p>The 82-day battle cost 12,500 American lives and a quarter-million Japanese lives, in addition to destroying the cities and the economy.</p>
<p>Okinawa was under U.S. rule for 27 years until 1972, during which time U.S. authorities appropriated land for their military. Only 15 percent of the acreage used by the U.S. military has been returned to Okinawans since 1972.</p>
<p>ECONOMY: One of the poorest regions of Japan, relying heavily on tourism. Other activities include agriculture, primarily sugarcane cultivation, and fishing. Per capita income is roughly half the level in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The U.S. bases are an important source of income. Some 7,800 Japanese are employed on the 40 U.S. bases.</p>
<p>Okinawa governor Masahide Ota has argued that the prefecture's best sites to develop new industries is occupied by the bases, limiting their ability to diversify.</p>
