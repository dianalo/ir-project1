<headline>Thailand decides to review second airport further.</headline>

<p>The Thai cabinet decided on Tuesday to review further the feasibility of building a second Bangkok airport at Nong Ngu Hao in the eastern outskirts of the capital, a government minister said.</p>
<p>Transport and Communications Minister Suwat Liptapallop told reporters after the cabinet meeting that it had been decided that a 11.96 billion baht expansion be made first to the existing Don Muang Bangkok airport to meet any passenger services increase in the meanwhile.  </p>
<p>The minister said the expansion of the Don Muang airport would be ready by 2000 and the government had enough time to review further the fate of the approximately 100-billion baht ($4 billion) Nong Ngu Hao project.</p>
<p>&quot;The Nong Ngu Hao project has been put on further review,&quot; he said. &quot;This does not mean it is delayed or suspended.&quot;</p>
<p>Controversy hit the second airport project last month when the government said it had been put on hold pending a review. The ministry was asked to make the review and its presentation at the cabinet meeting today was again indecisive.</p>
<p>The Nong Ngu Hao project has been hit by cost overruns and major delays.</p>
<p>The minister said Don Muang's expansion by 2000 would enable the airport, which is sited on land owned by the Royal Thai Air Force, to handle up to 45 million passengers annually and 65-70 flights per hour.</p>
<p>He said initial earthworks for the second airport project set to begin on February 18 would now be postponed until the review was completed.</p>
<p>Foreign investors and companies have been watching the fate of the airport closely because some of them have interests in the project.  </p>
<p>Thailand's Italian Thai Development Plc was one of the companies that had been awarded a multi-billion-baht contract to undertake initial earthworks for the project. A company official said the government would have to consult the company on what it planned to do next with the project as it had not been given any details yet.</p>
