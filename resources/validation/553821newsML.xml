<p>A 13-year-old black youth beaten into a coma in an apparent racial attack that spurred an appeal for harmony from President Clinton left the hospital Thursday still healing from severe brain injuries.</p>
<p>Lenard Clark, who remains moody and slightly unsteady from the brutal March 21 attack, left the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago and moved into a new ranch-style home provided to his family by the city's public housing authority.</p>
<p>Clark's beating created a tense climate in the city for weeks and sparked a series of volatile peace marches through the predominantly Irish enclave of Bridgeport. Mayor Richard Daley, among several local political figures who hail from Bridgeport, and black civil rights leaders appealed for calm and made prayerful visits to Clark's bedside.</p>
<p>Soon after the incident, Clinton said there was no excuse for violence against innocent victims. Aides said his new call for volunteerism to help rebuild urban ghettoes and save disadvantaged youths was also partly motivated by the attack.</p>
<p>&quot;This kind of savage, senseless assault, driven by nothing but hate, strikes at the very heart of America's ideals and threatens the promise of our future,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;We must stand together as a nation against all crimes of hate and say they are wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Clark's doctor said he may never recover fully from his brain injuries. Wearing a white hooded jacket, Clark was accompanied by a new puppy as he left the hospital, one of several gifts to his family that have poured in.</p>
<p>According to media report, Clark, a black friend and an older Hispanic youth had played basketball in Armour Square Park, across an expressway from Clark's former public housing apartment complex. Clark, who was wheeling his bicycle home, and his friends were accosted by a group of whites who drove Clark head-first into a brick wall and beat him, police said.</p>
<p>Three white teenagers, two of them students at a South Side Catholic high school and the third a recent graduate, await trial for the attack.</p>
