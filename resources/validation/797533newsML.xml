<p>A secret force of U.S., British and French military commandoes were training together to prepare for the capture of Bosnian war criminals, ABC Television reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The network's &quot;World News Tonight&quot; programme, quoting U.S. military sources, said small teams of the secret unit were training in Europe with the support of at least six other countries. The operation was separate from NATO peacekeepers.</p>
<p>The top two targets are former Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic and military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic, who are wanted by an international war crimes tribunal, but have continued to make public appearances, ABC said.</p>
<p>The sources told ABC no political decision had been made to use the force -- which has been trained in covert rescue and capture techniques -- but a general target date had been set for late autumn.</p>
<p>The network said the secret effort included intensified intelligence gathering by the Central Intelligence Agency, plus covert surveillance by soldiers.</p>
<p>Defence Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters earlier on Tuesday that Washington continued to believe that arresting war criminals was &quot;a police function&quot; and not a job for the military.</p>
<p>He said the United States remained commited to &quot;help the International War Crimes Tribunal bring indicted war criminals to justice,&quot; but felt capturing the indicted individuals was the &quot;job of the former warring factions.&quot;</p>
