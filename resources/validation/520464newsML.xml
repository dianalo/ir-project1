<p>At Mexico City's Tepito market, just about everything is for sale: Nike running shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, videos of the latest Hollywood fare -- even standard poodles.</p>
<p>It looks as if business is booming, but vendors say customers are actually not spending much -- still keeping their purse strings tight more than two years after the 1994 peso crash caused Mexico's worst recession in half a century.</p>
<p>&quot;We sell about half as much as we used to in 1994. Nowadays, we take what we can get, which is usually just enough for food and a roof over our heads,&quot; said Oscar Fuentes, a 26-year-old clothes salesman at Tepito.</p>
<p>By selling at discount prices, outdoor markets like Tepito are at least drawing customers. For department stores, things are much worse.</p>
<p>Not far from Tepito on a Mexico City avenue jammed with cars, the Electrofacil department store stands virtually empty, with only a few sales staff and an armed guard haunting the premises.</p>
<p>At a Sears outlet down the street, a handful of customers hunt for bargains. A salesman alone in the electronics department admits in a hushed tone: &quot;Sales are bad.&quot;</p>
<p>On paper, Mexico's economy looks as if it is recovering nicely from the peso crash. Last year, the economy bounced back 5.1 percent after a 6.2 percent slump in 1995. Unemployment, interest rates and inflation were halved. Most of the turnaround has been due to exports and investment, which show few signs of slowing.</p>
<p>But economists say it is hard to overestimate how damaging the economic breakdown was, and how long it may take for the &quot;real&quot; economy -- measured in real wages or GDP per capita -- to come out of it.</p>
<p>During much of 1996, analysts on Wall Street and in Mexico City kept predicting a rebound in consumer spending, the last and most important element of the recovery. It never came.</p>
<p>Companies, especially those that sell their goods mostly in Mexico, show no sign of a strong turnaround.</p>
<p>During the fourth quarter of last year, retailers saw their overall sales fall about 1 percent. Cifra, Mexico's largest retail chain, saw its same-store sales plummet 12 percent vs. the same quarter the year before.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important to point out that the recovery in the commercial sector has been slower than we expected,&quot; said a recent report by Mexico City's Inverlat brokerage.</p>
<p>Economists say the culprit is low real wages, which have plummeted about 25 percent in the past two years and are expected to remain flat this year before starting to gain ground in 1998.</p>
<p>Economists say that, although unemployment is down, the jobs available are lower paid than before the crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;You may have found a job after the recession, but it doesn't pay as well as the one you had. You can't afford what you bought in 1994,&quot; said Gerardo Copca, assistant director of research at Valores Finamex brokerage in Mexico City.</p>
<p>Most consumers also have a net outflow of credit, according to economists, paying out more money to banks in interest on past loans than they are getting in new credit.</p>
<p>Mexico's National Department Store Association has predicted the retail sector would not recover to 1994 pre-devaluation levels until 2001, assuming an expected annual sales recovery of 5 percent per year starting next year.</p>
<p>&quot;The recovery to 1994 sales levels in real terms will be achieved in self-service (supermarket) stores in 2001 and in department stores in 2003,&quot; association President Luis Santana told a news conference.</p>
<p>Weak sales during the fourth quarter flew in the face of some evidence that the average Mexican was finally spending more at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Recent GDP figures from the government showed the strongest part of the economy during 1996's last quarter was the service sector, which includes shops and restaurants.</p>
<p>But a few days after those numbers sparked a rally in Mexican stocks, retail sales figures painted an entirely different picture, showing more declines in purchases in the fourth quarter on a yearly basis and puncturing the GDP euphoria.</p>
<p>Government officials said the answer to the puzzle lies in the informal sector -- the mosaic of hundreds of outdoor markets like Tepito that appear to be recovering at the expense of established commerce.</p>
<p>&quot;We can sell things for half price here compared to the department stores,&quot; boasted Irais Aguilar, a 25-year-old vendor at the Insurgentes market in Mexico City.</p>
<p>&quot;People don't have much money, so what they do spend they are going to spend on us, not them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Economists say falling interest rates and higher employment should allow consumption this year to grow at about 3.5 percent, but still short of the expected 5 percent growth in the overall economy.</p>
<p>Most analysts are taking a wait-and-see attitude on the domestic recovery and want to see a trend in data before jumping to conclusions.</p>
