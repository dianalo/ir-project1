<p>MegaWorld Inc said on Thursday that it signed a letter of intent to acquire the privately held company Castello Torre Ratti SRL, whose main asset is a 1,000-year-old Italian castle.</p>
<p>MegaWorld did not disclose a purchase price, but said the transaction would involve cash and stock. The facility, which is serving as a resort and time sharing facility, was appraised at $8.3 million, MegaWorld said in a statement.</p>
<p>The castle has 15 time share units and plans are underway to create 25 more, Castello president Michael Giamalvo said. Giamalvo estimates that with 40 time share units operating, the castle could generate up to $19 million in profits over four years.</p>
<p>In announcing the planned acquisition, George Levy, the chief executive of MegaWorld, said the castle will be the company's first of several acquisitions in the time share industry.</p>
<p>MegaWorld Inc is a holding company with interests primarily in multimedia communications, entertainment and leisure activities.</p>
