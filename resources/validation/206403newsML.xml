<title>MEXICO: Mexico Cetes rate drifts up in thin trade at close.</title>
<headline>Mexico Cetes rate drifts up in thin trade at close.</headline>

<p>Mexico's overnight Cetes rate closed up 40 basis points at 29.40 percent on Thursday after another quiet session.</p>
<p>&quot;The difference between session high and low was just 50 basis points. It has been, and will continue to be, a market moving sideways at low volume,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The overnight rate ranged betweem 29.10 and 29.60 percent during the session.</p>
<p>Traders said thin volume held overnight rates close to the 29.50 percent mark for the past two weeks.  </p>
<p>&quot;GDP figures released today were good and bolster the outlook for growth, but now we're in the home stretch for the year, and most dealers are beginning to cover positions, if they have not already covered themselves until the new year,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry earlier announced gross domestic product in the third quarter rose 7.4 percent in real terms from the same period last year.</p>
<p>Traders said stable money and foreign exchange markets were leading to forecasts of little change in Cetes rates at next week's primary auction.  </p>
<p>&quot;Month-end demand for liquidity could hit rates...although the way things look now, rates could fall a little, albeit marginally,&quot; a money market analyst said.</p>
<p>Other analysts said that inflation in the first half of November would provide a better guide to the results of the auction. A Reuters survey of financial professionals showed an average forecast of 0.87 percent for inflation.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico is due to release inflation figures on Friday.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper closed up 20 basis points at 31.00 percent.  </p>
<p>Banco de Mexico injected 1.456 billion pesos by auctioning just one credit, which it assigned at 31.12 percent.</p>
<p>A liquidity shortfall of 3.731 billion pesos was initially expected because of credit maturities, with further tightening after the overplacement of 365 million pesos at the primary auction. But the traders said the shortfall was offset by government spending.</p>
<p>Traders expected a shortfall of some 8 billion pesos on Friday because of credit maturities and corporate tax bills falling due.</p>
