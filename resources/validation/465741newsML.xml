<p>The Kremlin on Tuesday defended President Boris Yeltsin's performance at last week's Helsinki summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton and rejected charges he had ceded too much ground over NATO expansion.</p>
<p>A compromise by Yeltsin, in which he dropped demands for a deal mapping out relations with NATO to be legally binding, was called a &quot;crushing defeat&quot; by his communist opponents.</p>
<p>But presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky, describing the Helsinki talks as the presidents' toughest summit yet, said Yeltsin had resisted NATO's plans to take in former Soviet bloc countries and compromised only to avoid new East-West conflict.</p>
<p>&quot;Compromise solutions had to be found...to avoid a senseless worsening in relations between Russia and the West, and between Russia and the United States, and to avoid a degeneration into confrontation,&quot; Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;In these conditions, Boris Yeltsin proved himself a skillful diplomat and negotiator, able to obtain the most possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky's comments, and the line presented by many Russian officials since last week's summit, reflect acceptance by the Kremlin of the realities of international diplomacy since Moscow lost its superpower status.</p>
<p>The Kremlin message is that Russia was in a tight corner in Helsinki over NATO expansion, a compromise was in the interests of Moscow and global stability and Yeltsin made the best of a bad hand.</p>
<p>&quot;According to President Yeltsin, these were the tensest talks he has ever conducted with the Americans,&quot; Yastrzhembsky said in his most detailed comments so far on the summit.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes it seemed that the talks were destined to failure because the two presidents were extremely firm and uncompromising in defending their views.&quot;</p>
<p>He said historians could one day call the summit the most important &quot;in the post-confrontation period&quot;, meaning since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<p>But that may largely be because Yeltsin dropped demands that the deal Moscow is negotiating with NATO to define post-Cold War ties with the Western defence alliance must be legally binding.</p>
<p>The 66-year-old president now says the deal must be politically binding, meaning it can be signed just by state leaders and need not be ratified by national parliaments.</p>
<p>So far, the opposition reaction has been muted although Communist party leader Gennady Zyuganov has accused Yeltsin of betraying Russia.</p>
<p>Analysts who support the Kremlin have been more prominent than the opposition since the summit, suporting the view that Yeltsin came away with as much as he could from Helsinki.</p>
<p>Glossing over the negative aspects, Yastrzhembsky presented the achievements at the summit as:</p>
<p>-- progress towards an agremeent defining relations with NATO, which he said Moscow hoped to sign before a NATO summit in July which will offer membership to some states</p>
<p>-- the United States and NATO had undertaken not to build up permanent NATO combat forces close to Russia's borders</p>
<p>-- Washington and NATO stated &quot;clearly and forcefully&quot; their commitment not to deploy nuclear weapons in new member states</p>
<p>-- positions were now closer on revising a 1990 treaty on conventional forces in Europe</p>
<p>-- mutual commitment to arms control agreements including the Anti-Ballistic Missiles treaty on missile defence systems</p>
<p>-- U.S. support for Russia's entry to international economic and trade organisations.</p>
