<p>Irish building materials group Heiton Holdings Plc said on Tuesday said it expects the construction industry to remain buoyant and is confident the group will deliver good full-year results.</p>
<p>&quot;The spread and mix of the group's businesses, backed up by the strong asset base, positive cashflows and nationwide presence, give us confidence that the group will deliver good results for the full year,&quot; Heiton said in its half-year results statement.</p>
<p>Heiton also said that improved retail spending and growth in jobs and disposable incomes throughout the Irish economy should underwrite the buoyancy of the construction industry.</p>
<p>The group said its aim in 1997 was to expand market share further and to improve customer service through continuing investment in new technology and new service-enhancing facilities.</p>
<p>Earlier, the group announced a 22 percent rise in first-half pre-tax profit to 4.7 million punts.</p>
<p>Turnover increased by eight percent to 71.8 million with sales in Heiton's builders merchants and steel division rising 12 percent on the first half of 1995. Turnover at Atlantic Homecare rose by five percent on a like-for-like basis and profits in both divisions were ahead of 1995.</p>
<p>The group said its operating margin improved to 6.8 percent in the first half from 6.3 percent a year earlier, fuelled by a combination of focused sales growth and effective cost management.</p>
