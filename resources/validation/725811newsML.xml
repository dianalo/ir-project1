<headline>HK bond market seen attracting int'l issuers - HSBC.</headline>

<p>Hong Kong's debt capital markets will continue to attract regional and international borrowers, Anita Fung, head of Hong Kong dollar bond markets at Hongkong Bank's HSBC Markets said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We will see more issuers both within the region or globally that will be interested in tapping the Hong Kong dollar debt market in different tenors,&quot; Fung said at a debt conference in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Fung noted that U.S. mortgage agency Fannie Mae last week launched the first-ever Hong Kong-dollar denominated global bond issue. Other AAA-rated issuers, such as the World Bank, also have tapped the Hong Kong dollar market.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is one of the most sophisticated financial centers in Asia outside Japan, with over US$103 billion in funds under management at the end of 1996, Fung said.</p>
<p>The government debt market is well developed. The yield curve for Exchange Fund Notes extends out to 10 years, among the longest in Asia, and is expected to be extended further.</p>
<p>The yield spread between Hong Kong dollar and U.S. dollar bonds has been narrowing over the last several years, reflecting a waning of the risk premium for Hong Kong paper.</p>
<p>&quot;The reduction of the spread or the risk premium is a vote of confidence from investors on the currency and financial well-being of the economy,&quot; said Fung.</p>
<p>Asia's huge funding needs for infrastructure development are expected to drive development of local bond markets, including Hong Kong's.</p>
<p>Fung noted that the World Bank has estimated Asia's infrastructure funding needs at US$8 trillion between 1994 and 2000.</p>
