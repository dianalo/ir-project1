<p>The global economy has shaken off weakness in Western Europe and is expected to achieve healthy growth through next year, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The IMF, in its semiannual report card on the economy, gave good grades to the emerging market countries, saying they are reaping the benefits from an often-painful return to fundamentals undertaken in recent years.</p>
<p>&quot;The global economic expansion is expected to continue at a satisfactory pace in 1996-97 and over the medium term,&quot; the IMF report said.</p>
<p>In a briefing on the report, IMF chief economist Michael Mussa told reporters, &quot;We expect a moderate strengthening and continued good performance on the inflaiton front.&quot;</p>
<p>The report by the international lending agency estimated the global economy would grow by 3.8 percent this year and 4.1 percent in 1997 after growing 3.5 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>Industrial countries were expected to grow 2.3 percent this year and 2.5 percent in 1997 after growing 2.1 percent last year.</p>
<p>Developing countries also showed vigorous activity, growing 6.3 percent this year from 5.9 percent in 1995. Growth will slow slightly next year to 6.2 percent.</p>
<p>The report said the industrial countries showed uneven results. The the United States chalked up robust growth and low unemployment but Germany and France lagged behind.</p>
<p>However, it said the outlook for Europe was improved as exchange rates came back into line, setting the stage for increased activity.</p>
<p>&quot;Together with a correction of earlier exchange rate misalignments, this has improved prospects for a resumption of stronger growth in the latter part of 1996,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It said the entrenched inflation that has stalked policy makers for years is finally on the run, but cautioned officials to guard the exit in case price pressures return with the strengthening economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation rates in industrial countries, as well as in a number of developing countries have declined to their lowest levels in decades,&quot; the report said. &quot;Monetary authorities will, of course course, need to remain vigilant&quot; regarding price pressures as growth continues or strengthens.</p>
<p>As an example, it said the U.S. economy was growing flat out with low unemployment and would benefit from a tightening of monetary policy so inflation doesn't break loose.</p>
<p>However, the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee decided to leave rates unchanged for now in its meeting Tuesday. Still the IMF projects short-term rates will rise about one-half of a percentage point next year.</p>
<p>As it has in the past, the IMF scolded Europe for not taking the tough actions needed to reform its poorly functioning labour markets.</p>
<p>&quot;For many countries, particularly in Europe, fiscal imbalances are related to shortcomings in the function of labour markets, which has resulted in a dramatic upward trend in unemployment over the past 25 years,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It said that, although the Japanese economy has responded remarkably well to stimulative efforts by the authorities with growth estimated at 3.5 percent this year after edging up only 0.9 percent in 1995, it is probably too soon to move interest rates higher.</p>
<p>&quot;But official interest rates will obviously need to be adjusted upward as the recovery gets further under way,&quot;</p>
<p>As a result, it estimated growth in Japan would moderate to 2.7 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Turning to Germany, which is estimated to grow 1.3 percent this year and 2.4 percent in 1997 after being up 1.9 percent in 1995, the IMF said the country had acted properly in easing monetary policy over the past year to help secure recovery.</p>
<p>The report also made clear that the so-called transition economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, which have often been the main focus of IMF policy makers in recent years, may have turned the corner. It estimated they would grow by 0.4 percent this year and 4.0 percent in 1997 after five years of decline.</p>
<p>&quot;The rewards for comprehensive reform and stabilisation efforts are very striking among the transition countries, where the results of economic transformation are increasingly visible,&quot; the report said.</p>
