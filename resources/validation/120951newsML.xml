<p>UTTAR PRADESH HEADING FOR CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS</p>
<p>The northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) was seen headed for a constitutional crisis as the United Front (UF) rejected the Congress appeal to back Mayawati of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) for the chief minister's post. The UF was keen to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power in UP. But it decided against supporting the BSP to form government in UP.

<p>PUBLIC ISSUE MINIMUM ALLOTMENT LIKELY TO BE RAISED</p>
<p>The bourse regulator, SEBI proposes to reduce the minimum allotment in a public issue from 500 to 100 shares. Originally, the minimum allotment stood at 100 shares. This was hiked to 500 shares last year after a deluge of issues hit a booming market and to reduce the number of applications. With small investors having deserted the market, the minimum allotment is again being reduced to revive the market.</p>

<p>EXPORT GROWTH MAY FALL SHORT OF TARGET</p>
<p>The export growth target for fiscal 1996/97 (April-March) may decline by 25 percent as compared to last fiscal. In value terms, it may fall short of the targeted $38 billion. The first quarter figure shows the growth rate hovered between 12 to 13 percent. Last year, it was above 20 percent. The total export billing during April-July 1996 was $10.8 billion, 12 percent up from the $9.72 billion recorded in the corresponding period last year. The total import billing stood at $11.92 billion during the period.</p>

<p>NEW LENDING SCHEME FOR CAPITAL MARKET</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry has approved introduction of an innovative stock lending scheme. This will allow a seller to borrow securities for a period and deliver them to a buyer against outstanding commitments.

Ministry sources claim the scheme will ease the capital market.</p>

<p>SHARP RISE IN EXPORT OF READYMADE GARMENTS</p>
<p>The export of readymade garments posted a sharp growth in the first five months of the current fiscal year between April and August over the same period last year. This was possible due to the easing of recession in the U.S, EU and Canada. The increase in garment export may make easier the realisation of the $4.75 billion target set for fiscal 1996-97 (April-March). Readymade garments worth $562.6 million were exported to the U.S in the period April-August 1996.</p>
