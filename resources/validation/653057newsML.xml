<p>China buried months of speculation on Wednesday by announcing that its head of state, President Jiang Zemin, will attend the ceremony marking the handover of Hong Kong to Beijing at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>This first visit to the territory, a British colony for 156 years, by a top leader of China and the chief of its Communist Party is due to last just a few hours.</p>
<p>Jiang will return to the Chinese capital for Beijing's own celebrations of its recovery of sovereignty over Hong Kong.</p>
<p>But he will remain long enough to attend an investiture ceremony for the post-colonial administration that has all the makings of unravelling into a diplomatic nightmare.</p>
<p>China plans to swear in future leader Tung Chee-hwa, the future judiciary and, controversially, an unelected legislature, on July 1, shortly after a solemn midnight flag ceremony signals the historic transition.</p>
<p>Tung welcomed Jiang's presence even as Britain and its Western allies attacked the new assembly, questioning its legitimacy and the need for it to replace the democratically elected Legislative Council.</p>
<p>Jiang's participation shows &quot;how much importance the central (Chinese) government attaches to Hong Kong's reunification with the motherland, and I feel very honoured to have them taking part in these historic ceremonies,&quot; Tung said.</p>
<p>In London, Britain's Foreign Secretary Robin Cook showed that the new Labour government shared the previous conservative government's condemnation of the Provisional Legislature.</p>
<p>&quot;I have roundly condemned the action of the Chinese government in dismissing the elected legislative council of Hong Kong and the intention to replace it on July 1 with a legislative council which has been appointed by a committee set up by Beijing,&quot; he told parliament on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Cook spoke shortly after the United States snubbed China by announcing that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would not attend any investiture of the unelected legislature, prompting a propaganda volley from China in reply.,</p>
<p>Members of the U.S. Congress endorsed Albright's decision, raising speculation that other Western nations may follow suit.</p>
<p>&quot;Particularly because the swearing-in of Beijing's appointees also accomplishes the swearing-out of the democratically elected representatives of the people of Hong Kong...representatives of the United States should not dignify such a proceeding,&quot; said Republican Christopher Cox of California.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, departing Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten welcomed Jiang's visit but urged China to reconsider its the ceremony agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it would have been better -- and wiser counsel may still prevail -- if as would customarily happen, the provisional legislature was being sworn in apart from the executive and judiciary,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>As China put the finishing touches to celebrations to mark the end of more than 150 years of national humiliation by declaring July 1 a national holiday, Hong Kong's democratic lobby cast around for a venue for protest rallies.</p>
<p>Pro-democracy activists hit out at civic authorities for refusing permission to stage their main rally in a public park on the first day of Chinese rule.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, which grew out of protests against Beijing's bloody crackdown on the 1989 pro-democracy movement, denounced the decision.</p>
<p>Legislator and Alliance chairman Szeto Wah said they were disappointed but they had expected obstacles. &quot;It's a kind of political vetting,&quot; Szeto said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Democratic Party has filed a constitutional challenge in the high court alleging the provisional legislature illegally usurped the power of the elected legislature.</p>
<p>Party members are expected to mark the handover with protests of displeasure.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is readying for a two-day extravaganza of fireworks, feasting and farewells to mark the handover, attended by over 4,000 foreign dignitaries.</p>
<p>Opinion polls show the mood among the wealthy and vibrant community of 6.4 million people to be generally positive towards the handover, but the installation of the provisional legislature and plans to roll back key civil liberties clauses have hurt future leader Tung's personal popularity.</p>
