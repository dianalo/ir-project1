<p>Germany pressed Iran for comment on Friday on reports that an Iranian journalist has been arrested in Tehran and that he was held last year by the Iranian secret service when he was supposedly in Germany.</p>
<p>Faraj Sarkuhi, editor of the monthly Adineh (Friday), is reported to have said that the authorities in Tehran tried to use him as a pawn to counter accusations against Iran made by German prosecutors in a Kurdish dissident assassination case.</p>
<p>Foreign-based opposition groups say Sarkuhi was held by the Iranian authorities during an unexplained absence of more than 40 days late last year, and that he has now been arrested again.</p>
<p>A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said a senior official telephoned the Iranian ambassador, Hossein Mousavian, on Friday to request an immediate explanation. Mousavian said his government would comment soon, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Sarkuhi was first reported missing last November, when he was scheduled to fly to Germany to visit his wife. She says he never arrived but Iran insists airline records showed he had flown to Germany.</p>
<p>Bonn said then that it believed he was still in Iran. But on December 20, Sarkuhi appeared at Tehran airport to hold a news conference, saying he had indeed been in Germany but had not told anyone of his whereabouts for personal reasons.</p>
<p>Opposition groups say the news conference was stage-managed by the Iranian authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel called upon to pursue this case with all necessary emphasis,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said.</p>
<p>Erdmann said the ministry believed a letter from Sarkuhi published in part on Thursday by the Berlin daily Tageszeitung was genuine.</p>
<p>The 14-page handwritten letter, a full copy of which was obtained by Reuters, said that Sarkuhi had been held by the Iranian secret service and forced under torture to confess in a taped interview that he had spied for Germany.</p>
<p>He said he believed authorities intended to use the confession in a row with Germany in which German prosecutors have accused Iranian leaders of having ordered the killing of four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin in 1992.</p>
<p>An Iranian and four Lebanese are being tried for the killings. Iran has denied involvement.</p>
<p>Sarkuhi said authorities had taken away his passport during his detention late last year and someone else had used it to enter Germany to obtain an entry stamp in order to prove Iran's claim that the journalist had left for Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;I know that with the means that they (authorities) have... with the false interviews and the Hamburg airport stamp, the truth will be squashed.</p>
<p>&quot;George Orwell's 1984 is nothing compared to what has happened to me. I do not know what to write. The end is near,&quot; Sarkuhi said in the letter.</p>
<p>According to the press freedom group Reporters Sans Frontieres, Sarkuhi was arrested in Tehran on Monday.</p>
<p>The Tageszeitung said it had information this report was correct and that Sarkuhi's brother had also been detained.</p>
<p>The Swedish government also said on Friday that it was pressing Iran for news of Sarkuhi's fate.</p>
