<p>NEW YORK, Jan 2 - The dollar finished mixed Thursday after new evidence of solid economic growth caused stocks and bonds to sell off on the first trading day of the year.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange trading was closed Wednesday for the New Year holiday. Volume remained light Thursday because financial markets in Japan will not reopen until Monday.</p>
<p>A key index of manufacturing business in the United States released Thursday posted an increase in December instead of declining as expected by many Wall Steet economists. The surprisingly strong data pressured stocks and bonds, which tumbled Tuesday after reports showed new homes sold at a brisk rate in November and consumers surveyed in December were feeling decidedly upbeat about the economy.</p>
<p>Signs that the economy is growing at a healthy pace often hurt stocks and bonds because investors worry that the Federal Reserve may boost short-term interest rates to keep inflation in check.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average sank almost 100 points and the 30-year Treasury Bond fell nearly 1-1/2 points. However, the Dow nearly erased all of its losses, while the Treasury bond regained only a fraction of the ground it lost.</p>
<p>The dollar followed stocks and bonds lower but also staged a recovery that left it higher against some currencies but lower against others.</p>
<p>The dollar slid as low as 1.5380 German marks and 115.30 Japanese yen. In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 115.58 yen Thursday, down from 116.08 yen Tuesday. It climbed to 1.5430 marks, up from 1.5400 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is not having any real strong direction because the asset markets are certainly more defensive as we go into the new year because Fed policy is looking not quite so certain as people thought it was going to be in December,&quot; said Tom Benfer, director of foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal in New York.</p>
<p>Benfer noted some investors had suggested in December that the Fed might have to lower rates.</p>
<p>The British pound, which soared Tuesday to $1.7163, its highest level in more than four years, lost ground to several currencies Thursday. The pound cost $1.6942 in late trade, down from $1.7125 Tuesday.</p>
<p>Anne Parker Mills, a foreign exchange analyst at Lehman Brothers, attributed the pound's weakness to political worries in Britain, technical factors in the foreign exchange market, a sharp drop in Britain's purchasing managers' index and thin market volume, which exaggerates price action.</p>
<p>The index measures activity in Britain's manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>The pound's steep losses against the mark also helped weaken the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;When it falls against the mark as quickly as this, some people will sell sterling against the dollar and then they will sell dollars against the mark to lock in a sterling-mark sale,&quot; said Steven Walker, a senior trader at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken in New York.</p>
<p>In other trading, the dollar rose to 1.3465 Swiss francs on Thursday from 1.3400 francs Tuesday, and to Canadian $1.3761 from C$1.3705.</p>
