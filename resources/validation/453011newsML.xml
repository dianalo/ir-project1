<p>The China Great Wall Trust and Investment Co had assets totalling 3.155 billion yuan ($380 million) at the end of 1996, the Financial News said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The trust company, formerly the Agricultural Bank of China Trust and Investment Co, was reorganised recently as part of a move to separate trust firms affiliated with China's four main state banks from their financial backers.</p>
<p>The company's local currency capital now stood at nearly 600 million yuan and its foreign currency capital stood at $10 million, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have formally started our business as Great Wall but we are still wholly invested by the Agricultural Bank,&quot; a company official said by telephone.</p>
<p>The trust firm would be managed independently and would pay taxes directly to the Ministry of Finance instead of turning over such funds to the bank as it did before, the official said.</p>
<p>A large portion of the firm's profits would still be handed over to the bank, he said without giving further details.</p>
