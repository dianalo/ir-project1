<p>Germany's Bayerische Vereinsbank AG expects a substantial rise in operating profits in 1997 amid modest global economic growth, its management board chairman Albrecht Schmidt said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a speech prepared for delivery at a news conference, Schmidt said: &quot;With four percent growth in the global economy and a slight economic recovery in Germany ... I am viewing Vereinsbank's future with optimism.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thus I expect a substantial increase in operating profit for 1997. Net interest income should rise in mortgage business and in banking business,&quot; Schmidt said.</p>
<p>In its annual report, which was released on Thursday, the bank also said it would not need to make a significant hike in risk provisions in 1997, despite difficult economic conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;The provisions we have made so far and our improved risk control should protect us from a significant increase in our risk provisions, despite the ongoing difficult economic situation and continued rise in insolvencies,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Vereinsbank's risk provisions fell to 704 million marks from 721 million in 1996.</p>
<p>Schmidt also added that Vereinsbank, a mortgage specialist, would struggle to match the strong growth in commission income it achieved in 1996, even if markets remained favourable.</p>
<p>Vereinsbank reported a 14.1 percent rise in commission income to 1.2 billion marks in 1996. Its operating profit, after risk provisions of 704 million marks, advanced 18.4 percent to 1.64 billion marks.</p>
<p>Net profit, released for the first time on Thursday, advanced 32.3 percent to 869 million marks.</p>
<p>Schmidt also forecast an improvement in own-account trading profits in 1997, partly because Vereinsbank had expanded its international trading activities.</p>
<p>Net income from own-account trading in 1996 fell to 254 million marks from 270 million.</p>
<p>Costs would increase only because of added spending, &quot;to expand our competitive positions and improve our profitability,&quot; Schmidt said.</p>
