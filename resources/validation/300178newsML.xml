<p>Swedish bar code pricing company Pricer AB will improve financially, but not reach a profit, in 1997, the company's president Erik Danielsson said on Friday.</p>
<p>A new deal with Swedish food retail chain ICA could mean revenues of 30 million crowns in 1997, Danielsson told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>The sale of ten percent of the firm's U.S. subsidiary Pricer Inc. will give the parent company about 70 million crowns this year, he said.</p>
<p>In the first nine months of the year, Pricer posted a pretax loss of 137 million crowns, while sales amounted to 8.5 million crowns and order intake was 256 million crowns at the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>Pricer offers wireless electronic shelf bar codes connected to a central store computer system.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Pricer released news about starting to cooperate with ICA.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of being a counterpart, ICA will market our products. We will be found in the 100 largest ICA stores pretty quickly. Then, we are really rolling on the Swedish market,&quot; Danielsson said.</p>
<p>ICA expects to sell 200,000-300,000 Pricer tags during 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The price per tag is about 100 crowns and with 300,000 installations in 1997 there could be sales of around 30 million crowns in 1997,&quot; Danielsson said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Pricer said it and U.S. Telxon, which makes radio based local networks (LAN) with handheld computers for retail stores, will establish technical and marketing cooperation.</p>
<p>Therefore, Telxon will invest $10 million in Pricer's U.S. subsidiary Pricer Inc., with Telxon taking a ten percent stake.</p>
<p>The companies will produce a wireless communications system with Telxon's radio technique and Pricer's infra-red technique. The first product will be presented in February.</p>
<p>Danielsson said Pricer's cooperation deal with Telxon was &quot;a very important strategic event in the company's history, comparable with the order from German chain Metro of 120 million crowns in 1995.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Through the cooperation with Telxon, we jump ten years forward in time in development on the U.S. market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think our U.S. turnover will be as big as our European already in 1999. Telxon gives us credibility and we will have signficant sales in the U.S. already in 1998.&quot;</p>
<p>The company will invest the 70 million crowns from the sale of 10 percent in Pricer Inc. in development. At the end of February, a new system will be launched in Germany and mid-year, this system will be established on all markets.</p>
