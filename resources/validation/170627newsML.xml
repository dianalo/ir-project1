<p>Gary Locke, the son of Chinese immigrants, became the first Asian-American elected governor of a mainland state on Tuesday night as Democrats won seven of 11 gubernatorial races.</p>
<p>Democrats also captured traditionally Republican strongholds of Indiana and New Hampshire, which elected state Sen. Jeanne Shaheen its first woman governor.</p>
<p>West Virginia, which normally votes Democratic, went to former Republican Gov. Cecil Underwood.</p>
<p>Locke, the top elected official in Washington state's King County, which encompasses Seattle, got 60 percent of the vote, compared with 40 percent for former state Sen. Ellen Craswell of the Republican Party's Christian conservative wing.</p>
<p>He succeeds liberal Democrat Mike Lowry, who is stepping down after one term marred by a sexual harassment scandal.</p>
<p>In a victory speech, Locke, who did not learn to speak English until elementary school, called education the &quot;great equaliser&quot; and said it would be his top priority.</p>
<p>&quot;Education made the dream of a better life possible for the members of our family,&quot; said Locke, who was surrounded by relatives. &quot;That's what we want for the people of our state.&quot;</p>
<p>In New Hampshire, Shaheen became the first Democratic governor of New England's most conservative state since 1980, defeating state board of education Chairman Ovide Lamontagne, 57 percent to 40 percent.</p>
<p>She even won in Lamontagne's own ward in the state capitol of Manchester. Incumbent Republican Stephen Merrill chose not to seek re-election.</p>
<p>Indiana elected Democratic candidate Frank O'Bannon governor in a close race to succeed retiring Democrat Evan Bayh. O'Bannon, the state's lieutenant governor, defeated Indianapolis' Republican mayor Stephen Goldsmith by a margin of 52 to 47 percent.</p>
<p>In West Virginia, Underwood beat Democrat Charlotte Pritt, a coal miner's daughter, by 52 to 46 percent with 91 percent of the precincts reporting. He will succeed Democratic Gov. Gaston Caperton who was precluded from seeking a third term.</p>
<p>Incumbent Democrats prevailed in North Carolina, Vermont, Delaware and Missouri, while Republicans were re-elected in Utah, North Dakota and Montana.</p>
<p>The party balance in the 11 contested seats remained unchanged at seven Democrats and four Republicans, although the governor's mansion changed parties in West Virginia and New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Democrats prevailed in North Carolina, where incumbent Jim Hunt defeated Republican challenger Robin Hayes and in Vermont where incumbent Howard Dean beat Republican John Gropper. Delaware incumbent Thomas Carper beat Republican Janet Rzwenicki, and in Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan defeated Republican Margaret Kelley.</p>
<p>Republicans kept the governor's mansion in Utah, where incumbent Mike Leavitt defeated Democrat Jim Bradley. North Dakota incumbent Edward Schafer beat back Democrat State Representative Lee Kaldor. And in Montana, incumbent Marc Racicot defeated Democrat Judy Jacobsen.</p>
<p>Jacobson had been the candidate for lieutentant governor, but her name was placed at the top after her running mate Chet Blaylock, 71, died from a heart attack only two weeks before the election.</p>
