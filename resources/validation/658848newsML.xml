<title>CANADA: Magna shares climb on earnings, sales.</title>
<headline>Magna shares climb on earnings, sales.</headline>

<p>Shares in Magna International Inc climbed on Friday for the third straight day since the auto parts maker reported record profit and sales figures earlier in the week.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they surprised a lot of analysts with better than expected earnings,&quot; said Robert Schpoont, an analyst at S&amp;P Equity Group in New York.</p>
<p>Schpoont said he raised his rating on Magna yesterday after the Markham, Ontario-based auto parts maker on Wednesday reported a 31-percent increase in sales for the third quarter ended April 30 1997 from the same period a year earlier.  </p>
<p>Shares in Magna rose 2.70 to 84.00 in turnover of more than a million shares in Toronto on Friday. The stock has climbed more than 10 from its Tuesday close of 73.10, before the earnings release.</p>
<p>In New York, Magna shares climbed 1-3/4 to 60-5/8.</p>
<p>Schpoont said the record sales, combined with record net operating income, which increased 39 percent to C$125.4 million in the quarter, made investors sit up and take notice.</p>
<p>&quot;They are making more of the vehicle, or adding more parts to the vehicle, and also, not only that, the number of vehicles rose, too, so that's what drove sales up,&quot; he said.&quot;  </p>
<p>But Richard Morrow, an auto analyst at CIBC Wood Gundy in Toronto, said the stock climb is more a recognition of Magna's future potential than a reaction to its recent earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think they were that far (above) expectations...I think it's a recognition of the future earnings potential of various Magna initiatives, one of which would be hydroforming, the second of which would be improved earnings to come from acquisitions over the last two years,&quot; Morrow said.</p>
<p>He said Magna has been very successful in its marketing of hydroforming, which it first announced about two years ago, and is now at a point where it can deliver on their promises.  </p>
<p>&quot;They are beginning to show the new production facilities that they've built and have re-energized the marketing effort, and the available market looks really substantial,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Schpoont said Magna has show itself capable of integrating its growing empire and more acquisition possibilities are on the table.</p>
<p>&quot;They're integrating for acquisitions and they're doing a very good job at that. Usually when a company acquires a company the margins decline, and (Magna's) margins have declined very little, almost insignificantly,&quot; said Schpoont.</p>
