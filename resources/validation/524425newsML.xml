<p>Leftist rebels detonated two car bombs and attacked three police sentry posts early on Monday in Cucuta, capital of Colombia's northeast province of Norte de Santander, authorities said.</p>
<p>The back-to-back car bombs, which exploded shortly after midnight, caused serious damage to the city's main brewery and to a branch office of Banco Ganadero, the country's leading commercial bank, police and municipal officials said.</p>
<p>They said the suspected National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels who set off the bombs later stole several taxis and used them for hit-and-run attacks on three police sentry posts across the city. Four policemen were injured.</p>
<p>The ELN, Colombia's second leading guerrilla group, was founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in 1966. The top guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), was blamed earlier for killing five people on Sunday in a rural area of northwestern Antioquia province.</p>
<p>Police said a squad of about 40 FARC rebels paraded residents of the small town of Liborina into the town's main square where they accused a municipal official and four peasants of collaborating with the military.</p>
<p>The five were then summarily executed as townspeople watched in horror before the guerrillas retreated into the surrounding countryside, police said.</p>
<p>FARC rebels were also blamed for torching eight cargo trucks on Sunday in eastern Vichada province. The empty trucks had just dropped off material for the construction of a new military base in a rural area of Vichada when they were stopped at a makeshift rebel roadblock. Police said drivers of the vehicles were ordered out of their cabs before the trucks were set ablaze.</p>
<p>Transportation Minister Carlos Hernan Lopez had voiced fears earlier that guerrillas would seek to take advantage of a nationwide truckers' strike, which began at midnight on Saturday, to add to Colombia's chronic law-and-order problems.</p>
