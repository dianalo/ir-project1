<p>Norwegian shares remained flat on Wednesday, although sentiment was positive despite reduced volume as the summer lull set in.</p>
<p>Dealers said players continued to search out the blue chip stocks as volatility in short-term interest rates had increased risk in smaller companies.</p>
<p>&quot;Of what little interest there is the main volume is in the blue chips. They appear slightly safer than the smaller caps because of short term interest rates,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>The Total share index closed 0.23 percent up at 1,183.67 points in moderate turnover of 800 million crowns.</p>
<p>Dealers said offshore technology companies Kvaerner and Aker Maritime continued to gather interest due to the high level of activity in the British, Norwegian and Danish oil sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;This industry is technology driven and there are a lot of developments in Europe, as well as the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa, which are leading to new (hydrocarbon) finds. That's good for suppliers to the oil industry,&quot; the broker said.</p>
<p>Forestry group Norske Skog and metals producer Elkem were seen as positive with upward potential following a bottoming out of product prices, dealers said.</p>
