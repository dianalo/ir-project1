<title>UK: Dollar/yen steady, G7 discussion on trade seen key.</title>
<headline>Dollar/yen steady, G7 discussion on trade seen key.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>The dollar was steady against the yen with the spotlight on trade relations between the U.S. and Japan as leaders and finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations gathered for a three-day summit.</p>
<p>Concern that Japan's widening trade surpluses would become a target for U.S. criticisms had driven the dollar down as low as 112.75 earlier this week.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton assuaged concern that America might modify its calls for a strong dollar in the light of the widening surpluses after he said Thursday that exchange rates should not be used as a means of redressing trade balances.  </p>
<p>These remarks, and the smaller-than-expected April U.S. trade deficit reported Thursday, helped the dollar off its lows.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade will play some role in the G7 discussions, which might see the yen a touch firmer next week,&quot; said Steven Hannah, the director of economic research at IBJ International. &quot;But I don't expect it to be too big an issue given that Clinton has already made it clear that talking the dollar down is not the appropriate way to deal with the problem.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.7270/80 at 1045 GMT from 1.7246/56 late Thursday in Europe. It was at 114.40/50 from 114.13/23 yesterday.  </p>
<p>Traders paid little immediate heed to the communiques the G7 issued at their two summits earlier this year. The G7 signalled in February and again in April that they wanted an end to the dollar's two-year rally and called for more currency stability.</p>
<p>The dollar set a four-and-a-half-year high of 127.46 yen on May 1, a week after the April G7 summit, and surged to a 39-month high of 1.7423 marks on June 6.</p>
<p>It is expected to make less headway in the wake of this summit, however, given trade concerns will linger until Japan's trade surplus, particularly with the U.S., show signs of narrowing.  </p>
<p>&quot;Unless the G7 come up with something out of the ordinary, the dollar's upside seems limited,&quot; said Jayson Laurence, a senior trader at Bank of Montreal.</p>
<p>Traders are also more wary of the risk of a pick up in Japanese economic recovery than they were a few months ago. There was scant evidence of such a pick up in a report Friday which showed Japan's diffusion index of leading economic indicators down at 5.6 in April from 36.4 in March and its index of coincident indicators down at 10 from 81.8 in March.</p>
<p>Still, IBJ's Hannah said Japanese data next week, including the tankan survey, could be the trigger for renewed yen gains.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's a heavy week for Japanese data next week and the risks are on the upside for Japanese growth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, trading in mark/yen offered traders some excitement. The German currency pared much of the gains it had made overnight against the yen, boosting dollar/mark towards 1.73 marks. Sterling also benefited, climbing to a new 58-month high of 2.85 marks.</p>
<p>Mark/yen was at 66.25/28 from 66.19/22 late Thursday. The pound was at 2.8480/90 from 2.840/20 yesterday.</p>
