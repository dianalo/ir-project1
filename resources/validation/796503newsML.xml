<p>Thailand is likely to head towards  a period of stagflation after consumers are hit by the baht devaluation, higher value-added tax and the government's austerity measures.</p>
<p>Although the country has to face high inflation while growth is stagnant and consumer purchasing power is diminished, on the bright side, the trade, current account and fiscal balances are likely to improve, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The (stagflation) could last for almost two years. It is a painful transition that everyone has to go through before the economy recovers,&quot; said Arporn Chewakrengkai, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Stagflation refers to an economy where rising inflation is accompanied by falling or static industrial growth and employment.</p>
<p>Analysts predicted that consumer costs would start to rise sharply after the de facto baht devaluation on July 2, a situation likely to be exacerbated by austerity measures adopted in exchange for financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>The measures included maintaining tight fiscal and monetary policy, continuing the managed float exchange rate system, cutting the current account deficit and curbing inflation.</p>
<p>The government will also cut spending and raise value-added tax to 10 percent from seven percent from August 16. It is also mulling curbing credit card spending and imposing an exit tax.</p>
<p>Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya earlier this week secured $16 billion in standby credit arranged by the IMF and the agreement is likely to be signed within this month.</p>
<p>By accepting the package, the government must implement the measures that it pledged and that will inflict woes on the entire country, analysts said.</p>
<p>After the devaluation oil firms have already raised their pump prices to reflect higher costs. Higher costs of fuel also forced transportation companies to hike their fares.</p>
<p>Utilities will also rise on the back of rising oil prices. And the government will not be able to intervene due to its pledge with the IMF.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflation will go up while the Thais have to cut their spending, no doubt. But you have no other choice, either the whole country tightens its belt or plunge further into the economic crisis,&quot; said Chia Woon Khien, head of Asian research at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think this government alone should be blamed for what happened. The problem has been built up for sometime before it erupted...Prime Minister Chavalit's job now is to convince the country to take a bitter pill or die together,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the situation on the inflation front could go from bad to worse if the baht depreciated further.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see the baht firming substantially within 12 months,&quot; said an analyst at a major U.S. investment bank.</p>
<p>But Chia Woon Khien said inflationary pressures will be limited by the fact that Thailand is self-sufficient in food.</p>
<p>&quot;The target of 8.0-9.0 percent is a bit optimistic. But I don't think the actual inflation would go much higher than that because Thailand has quite a low import to GDP ratio compared to Malaysia or Singapore,&quot; she said.</p>
