<p>Canadian manufacturers' shipments rose 0.6 percent in February, to C$35.21 billion seasonally adjusted from C$35.02 billion (revised from C$35.05 billion) in January, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>				  Month pct	Total</p>
<p>   New Orders		 -2.0	    C$35.48 bln</p>
<p>   Unfilled orders	  +0.8	    C$35.29 bln</p>
<p>   Inven (owned)	    +0.4	    C$45.52 bln</p>
<p>				   Feb	     Jan</p>
<p>   Inven to shipments     1.29	    1.29</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of economists had forecast shipments to rise 1.1 percent, new orders to rise 0.8 percent, unfilled orders to rise 1.6 percent and an inventory/shipment ratio of 1.28.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada said the increase in shipments came despite a 1.4 percent drop in the auto sector. The rest of manufacturing advanced 1.0 percent. Increases were recorded in 17 of 22 major industry groups, but accounted for only 45 percent of shipments. The biggest increases were in paper, printing, publishing and fabricated metal products. Oil and coal product shipments fell 4.2 percent due to lower energy prices.</p>
<p>The inventory to shipment ratio remained close to the all-time lows of two years ago, pointing to possible increases in output in the short term, the federal agency said.</p>
<p>Inventories rose most in the aircraft and parts and food industries while declining in the refined oil and coal products and electrical products industries.</p>
<p>Unfilled orders, a determinant of future shipments, were now just shy of the record levels reached almost two years earlier, boosted by transportation equipment and machinery but partly offset by a decline in the primary metal industry.</p>
<p>The positive results in unfilled orders agreed with the agency's business conditions survey, in which manufacturers said they expected significant increases in production and orders in the first quarter, and expressed less concern about the level of finished product inventories.</p>
