<p>Turkish shares posted losses on Friday amid profit-taking sparked by firm resistance at the index's 1,700 level, but rebounded from lows on support, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100  .XU100 closed down 38 points, or 2.31 percent at 1,605 after moving between 1,573 and 1,649.</p>
<p>Trade volume dived to 36.55 trillion lira from Thursday's 64.91 trillion.</p>
<p>&quot;The index rebounded in early afternoon on support awaited at near the 1,550 level and drifted sideways afterwards,&quot; said Nazmi Sarikaya from Disbank.</p>
<p>Brokers said the index might to move in a range between 1,550 and 1,700 before testing the 1,700 barrier again, after two unsuccessfull attempts this week.</p>
<p>&quot;The rally has lost speed after the sharp rise since the New Year. It may ease on profit-taking, but I do not expect a steep fall because interest rates are still very low and liquidity is high,&quot; said Atilla Koksal, general manager of Interyatirim.</p>
<p>The index had regained 5.93 percent in the last two days after Tuesday's 8.76 percent down correction which followed a 74.2 percent surge and 17 record closes from end-1996 to Monday's all-time high close of 1,700.</p>
<p>The uptrend had speeded up after last Thursday's contitutional court ruling giving green light to Turk Telekom's sell-off.</p>
<p>Of the 238 shares traded, 133 declined, 69 advanced and 36 ended steady. The IMKB Industrial  .XUSIN dropped 2.03 percent to 1,637, the IMKB Services  .XUHIZ fell 2.14 percent to 1,597 and the IMKB Finacial  .XUMAL shed 2.19 percent to 1,565.</p>
<p>Top actives were largely state-owned flat steel maker Eregli, down 1,500 lira at 21,500, utilities Cukurova Elektrik, down 7,500 lira at 240,000 and Aktas Elektrik, down 2,500 lira at 200,000. They made up 32.4 percent of the total turnover.</p>
