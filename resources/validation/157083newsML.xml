<p>Florida will gain nearly four million residents from other states in the next 30 years, while births and immigration will add another 2.5 million people, according to a report published Thursday in Tampa Tribune.</p>
<p>That would bring the state's population to 20.7 million by 2025, according to the report based on U.S. Census data and compiled by University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research.</p>
<p>The report projects Florida will get nearly twice as many residents from other states as Texas, which is projected to be the second most popular relocation spot.</p>
<p>If the forecast is accurate, Florida would become the nation's third most populous state by 2015, surpassing New York nearly five years earlier than previously expected. California and Texas would still be the first and second most populous states, the report projects.</p>
<p>&quot;Urban and suburban areas are going to continue to spread,&quot; said</p>
<p>Stanley Smith, director of the university research bureau. &quot;Roads</p>
<p>are going to become more crowded, bigger or both. There will be</p>
<p>fewer and fewer unoccupied areas. Public places will become more</p>
<p>crowded - beaches, parks, recreation areas.&quot;</p>
<p>The projected influx could strain environmental and government</p>
<p>resources, but would still fall short of the boom that marked the</p>
<p>last 30 years, when Florida's population grew by 8.2 million.</p>
<p>Nor would the influx be all negative, said Smith, who predicts it</p>
<p>would result in a rapidly growing economy, rising property values</p>
<p>and new industrial and cultural opportunities.</p>
<p>Florida's public schools, which have been growing at the rate of</p>
<p>60,000 new students a year, will get a bit of a breather. The report</p>
<p>projects that growth will begin to taper off next year and slow through</p>
<p>2004, then flatten out through 2010 before increasing again.</p>
