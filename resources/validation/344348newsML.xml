<title>NETHERLANDS: ARA bunkers steady while rest of Europe falls.</title>
<headline>ARA bunkers steady while rest of Europe falls.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-01-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>ARA bunker prices were broadly steady on Thursday, while other European bunkers removed most of Wednesday's gains, dealers said.</p>
<p>Demand in most ports remained slack.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 CST was quoted at around $97/$98 fob, but fluctuated during the day as the barge market first firmed then dipped. The bunker quotes were little changed from Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>Traders and storage firms mostly agreed that stock levels in the ARA region were high and likely to remain so as Russian and Venezuelan cargoes arrived.</p>
<p>Total ARA demand remained low as shipowners first launched a number of enquiries, but then backed out once the market subsided.</p>
<p>Hamburg prices were also steady and demand very low.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean bunkers fell by an average $2 a tonne. No ports registered healthy demand.</p>
<p>Further east, Eqyptian prices dropped by $4/$5 a tonne, drawing away some business from other eastern Mediterranean ports. However, Alexandria remained dry.</p>
