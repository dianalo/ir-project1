<p>The Polish zloty firmed slightly against the basket of currencies on the back of small scale foreign purchases of Polish treasuries and currency sales supported by the fall of the dollar/mark rate, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the local market was mainly driven by dollar/mark moves and small net foreign currency selling likely caused by investment in Polish securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Currency sales were driven by the dollar's fall against the mark and net foreign investment into Polish T-bills and stocks,&quot; said Pawel Lopuszynski from Pekao SA.  </p>
<p>The zloty closed at 3.06/3.01 percent from the parity rate, stronger than Monday's 2.96/2.93 percent. It closed at 3.0720/35 to the dollar, up from 3.0748/60 on Monday and at 1.8250/60 to the mark, up from 1.8220/25.</p>
<p>Polish one-day deposits traded above 22 percent on Tuesday as banks kept high reserve levels ahead of the expected outflows on monthly tax payments later this week.</p>
<p>Banks' liquidity was also strained by investment in Monday's T-bill tender and today's 273-day NBP-bill sale.</p>
<p>The central bank sold 500 million zlotys of its 273-day bills at a flat average yield of 22.00 percent.  </p>
<p>Overnight deposit rates were at 22.05/22.40 percent, up from opening's 21.75/22.00 percent, tomorrow/next rates were at 22.15/22.45 percent, up from 21.80/22.10 percent.</p>
