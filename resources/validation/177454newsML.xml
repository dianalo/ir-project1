<title>ITALY: SOCCER-ZOLA JOINS CHELSEA FOR &quot;TACTICAL REASONS&quot;.</title>
<headline>SOCCER-ZOLA JOINS CHELSEA FOR &quot;TACTICAL REASONS&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>PARMA, Italy 1996-11-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Striker Gianfranco Zola, saying he was moving to England for &quot;tactical reasons&quot;, became Chelsea's third Italian player on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm emigrating for tactical reasons,&quot; the diminutive Sardinian told a news conference after his last practice with Serie A club Parma, with whom he won the UEFA Cup in 1995.</p>
<p>There were no immediate details of the contract but it was reported in Italy to be for two years and worth between 11 and 12 billion lire ($6.6 to $7.2 million). Earlier reports put the deal at 13 billion lire ($7.8 million).</p>
<p>Zola, 30, will join compatriots Gianluca Vialli and Roberto Di Matteo at Chelsea, managed by Dutch former AC Milan player Ruud Gullit.</p>
<p>The Italian said his move to the English premier league club was dictated by problems at Parma, where coach Carlo Ancelotti wanted him as a right-sided midfielder rather than as an outright striker.</p>
<p>Parma have in-form Italian international Enrico Chiesa and Argentine Hernan Crespo, both signed in the close season, as their first-choice strikers in a two-pronged attack.</p>
<p>&quot;This team was not built to keep either Crespo, Chiesa or me out of the attacking line-up,&quot; Zola said.</p>
<p>&quot;But after our early elimination from the Italian and UEFA Cups the situation only got worse and I was asked to change my game, which was difficult for me to accept because I know I can contribute more in another position,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Zola said he was enthusiastic about playing in England and would fly to London on Monday to meet the media.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be exciting for the soccer and also culturally. I'll finally be able to learn English well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Parma said there were no hard feelings.</p>
<p>&quot;The separation is by mutual agreement,&quot; said general manager Michele Uva, confirming the move. &quot;The deal between Zola, us and Chelsea has been finalised to everyone's satisfaction.&quot;</p>
<p>Zola is the third player in a year to leave Parma for England. Colombian Faustino Asprilla went to Newcastle and Swede Tomas Brolin to Leeds.</p>
<p>Zola, who scored 49 goals in 102 league games since joining Parma in 1993, was Diego Maradona's understudy when Napoli won the league title in 1989-90. He spent four seasons at Napoli after starting out in minor league clubs in his native Sardinia.</p>
<p>The playmaker has been a stalwart of the Italian national team for years and was one of the few players who stood out in their 2-1 defeat by Bosnia in a friendly played in Sarajevo's Kosevo Stadium on Wednesday.</p>
<p>His most recent experience of playing in England was at the European championship in June when he missed a crucial eighth-minute penalty against Germany at Old Trafford, Manchester, that would have kept Italy in the competition.</p>
