<p>The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) said on Tuesday it had deported a record number of illegal immigrants during the first three months of 1997, mostly to Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>According to its preliminary statistics, the INS said it returned 22,595 foreigners to their home countries between January 1 and March 31, a 28 percent increase over the same period last year.</p>
<p>During the first half of fiscal 1997, which started last October 1, the INS removed a total 42,426 illegal immigrants, and is on track to achieve its goal of 93,000 deportations for this fiscal year, INS general counselor David Martin told a news conference.</p>
<p>The United States sent 68,657 foreigners back to their countries during fiscal 1996. Of that total, 36,909 were people who had criminal records.</p>
<p>Nearly three of every four illegal immigrants deported by the INS are from Mexico.</p>
<p>According to INS estimates, around five million people reside illegally in the United States. That population has grown by about 250,000 per year during this decade.</p>
<p>INS Commissioner Doris Meissner told the same news conference that the United States was working with foreign governments to develop a formal notification system in order to advise other countries about the deportation of criminals.</p>
<p>She said the INS expected to have the system in place by July.</p>
<p>The U.S. policy against illegal immigration was high on the agenda of Latin American and Caribbean leaders who met with President Bill Clinton during his trip to the region last week.</p>
