<p>Europe went into the New Year in the grip of a biting cold spell that brought heavy snowfalls and was reported to have killed at least 43 people in Romania and caused other deaths across the continent.</p>
<p>In Italy, animal rights groups were incensed by the death of a circus hippopotamus which collapsed after being let out to exercise in sub-zero temperatures.</p>
<p>Elsewhere across the continent, heavy snowfalls disrupted rail and road traffic and caused flight cancellations while police in several countries warned would-be New Year's Eve revellers to dress warmly for any midnight festivities.</p>
<p>But it was Europe's homeless -- their numbers boosted by five years of conflict in the Balkans -- who remained most at risk on the eve of 1997 as temperatures plummeted to as low as minus 24 Celsius (minus 11 Fahrenheit) in some parts.</p>
<p>The Romanian independent daily Adevarul quoted Bucharest morgue director Vladimir Belis as saying that of the 43 people who had frozen to death there since Christmas, 28 had been homeless.</p>
<p>&quot;Our morgue has a limited capacity and is overcrowded by the corpses. Cemeteries are refusing to bury them, saying the soil is frozen and they can't dig graves,&quot; Belis said.</p>
<p>The latest deaths in Romania, which has a large population of adults and children living rough, suggest that well over 100 people have now died in cold-related deaths in Europe in the past week.</p>
<p>In Italy, where Venice lagoon has frozen over, at least three people died in weather-related incidents including a 24-year-old with heart trouble who died while walking his dog. Heavy snow in the north and north-west of the country disrupted rail, road and air traffic.</p>
<p>But it was the fate of Penelope, a 12-year-old circus hippo who died on Monday in Udine of bronchial pneumonia, that touched the hearts of Italians.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the clearest sign of the great suffering that the recent icy temperatures are causing to exotic animals in circuses throughout Italy,&quot; said Adolfo Sansolini, director general of the Italian Anti-Vivisection League, in an angry statement.</p>
<p>In Germany, where night-time temperatures have dropped to minus 15C (5F) and four people have died in the past week, 16 poorly-dressed illegal immigrants -- 15 of them from Bangladesh -- gave themselves up to authorities in the eastern town of Wildau rather than stay outdoors any longer.</p>
<p>In Serbia, blizzards dumped heavy snow on the capital Belgrade. But they appeared unlikely to dampen the ardour of the political opposition which planned a rally through midnight to climax 44 days of protest against President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
<p>The Serbian city of Novi Sad meanwhile recorded a temperature of minus 24C (minus 11F) -- its lowest December temperature since 1960.</p>
<p>In Russia, the Emergencies Ministry spoke optimistically about the fate of 300 people trapped by avalanches in a tunnel in the Caucasus mountains, saying their evacuation was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said on Monday that two women had given birth while trapped in the tunnel and one new-born child had died of the cold. Two other people were reported to have died in the area over the weekend.</p>
<p>In Spain, where five people have died up to now in the cold snap, snow fell heavily in Madrid and in surrounding mountains and towns on Tuesday and police advised against any driving in central and northern parts.</p>
<p>In France, a 58-year-old man who died in his unheated caravan near the Atlantic port of La Rochelle became the country's 11th victim of the cold spell.</p>
<p>Cold was seen as the likely cause of an electronic failure which blocked a Eurostar train and its 469 passengers for nearly three hours in the Channel Tunnel between France and Britain on Monday night.</p>
<p>Southern parts of Britain experienced heavy snowfalls overnight into Tuesday -- up to 12 cms (five inches) in Sussex and Kent regions, the worst since 1981.</p>
<p>But the cold snap spelled good news for skating enthusiasts in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>As ice thickened on the country's canals, prospects grew for the historic 200-km (125-mile) Elfstedentocht -- Eleven Cities Race -- to be held for the first time in 10 years.</p>
