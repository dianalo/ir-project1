<p>Two private firms on Friday took control  of Manila's waterworks and sewerage system, prompting a protest, a  court case and swift disagreements over rates.</p>
<p>Manila Water Co and Maynilad Water Services Inc signed 25-year concession  contracts to serve 10.6 million people in Manila and its neighbouring  provinces at a ceremony in the presidential palace.</p>
<p>It is one of Manila's biggest privatisation efforts, with the two  concessionaires expected to invest about $7.5 billion to improve the  dilapidated water supply and sewerage system.</p>
<p>Outside the palace, workers of Manila Waterworks and Sewerage System  (MWSS) denounced the handover of the system to private hands, saying  it spelt layoffs for its 5,400 employees.</p>
<p>&quot;We condemn the callousness of the Ramos government in the face of  the mass layoff of all 5,400 employees ... as a result of its privatisation,&quot;  the MWSS Employees' Union said.</p>
<p>The workers have asked the Supreme Court to stop the privatisation  but the court has not yet acted on the petition.</p>
<p>Manila Water Co is a consortium comprised of Ayala Corp, British-based  United Utilities and Bechtel of the United States.</p>
<p>Maynilad is a joint venture between Benpres Holdings Corp and France's  Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux.</p>
<p>Both companies said they had no plans to layoff the workers but said  they would be put on probation.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not have any immediate plans (to layoff people). If we can  use all the employees certainly we will want to ... We're starting  to work together. There has been no problem at all. So I think things  are proceeding very smoothly,&quot; Fernando Zobel de Ayala, Manila Water  chairman, told reporters.</p>
<p>Besides the labour problems, the new operators of the waterworks system  are also grappling with differences among themselves over interconnection  fees.</p>
<p>Manila Water's concession will cover the eastern zone of the service  area while Maynilad will handle the western zone.</p>
<p>As most of the city's water supply comes from the provinces and through  the eastern zone, Manila Water will initially treat about 300 million  litres of water per day or about 60 percent of Maynilad's water.</p>
<p>But Manila Water wanted to charge 9.50 pesos (32 cents) per million  litre while Maynilad was only willing to pay 0.50 pesos.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought for a moment that we might not be here this afternoon.  It was a photo finish to the wire. But (Ayala's) spirit of cooperation  and flexibility and their intense belief in the value of this project,  have enabled the negotiators to drive over the rough points of the  agreement,&quot; Benpres chairman Eugenio Lopez said during the signing  ceremony.</p>
<p>They would form an arbitration committee to arrive at a compromise  on rates within 60 days, Maynilad president Luis Mirasol said.</p>
<p>The MWSS was one of the most inefficient utility firms in the country,  serving only 67 percent of its service area, as 65 percent of its  water is lost to leaks and damaged pipes.</p>
<p>Manila Water and Maynilad said they would immediately deal with the  problem of leaking pipes, although both declined to say how much they  would spend on the repairs. ($ = 28.9 Philippine Pesos)</p>
