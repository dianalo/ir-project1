<p>The Rattlesnake Holding Co Inc said Thursday it was restructuring its management and operations as well as rearranging its business plans, leading to the closure of restaurants and the resignation of senior executives.</p>
<p>&quot;The company has taken steps to reduce its corporate overhead from approximately $1,900,000 to approximately $650,000 on an annualized basis,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>Rattlesnake said it has closed restaurant operations at its Fairfield, Conn., and White Plains, N.Y., locations with a view towards selling or changing the concept at these facilities.</p>
<p>It said it is also selling its New York City leasehold and concentrating its efforts on developing its existing profitable restaurants.</p>
<p>Rattlesnake said William Opper has resigned as chief executive officer to &quot;pursue independent business endeavors in the restaurant industry.&quot;  Opper will nevertheless remain chairman of the board of directors, it added.  </p>
<p>David Sederholt has resigned as chief financial officer but will remain as president and chief operating officer, it said.</p>
<p>Stephen Stein has stepped down as vice chairman and chief administrative officer to become a paid consultant for a period of two years, it added.</p>
<p>&quot;The company continues to seek additional capital to support its operations and retire debt,&quot; it said, adding that it has obtained a private investment of $500,000 in convertible notes secured by its operations.</p>
<p>The Rattlesnake Holding Co Inc is a chain of casual, theme dining restaurants featuring a Southwestern motif.</p>
