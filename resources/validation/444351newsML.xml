<p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) announced its final deregulation proposals on Friday, calling for a wide-ranging review of the financial and land-tax systems.</p>
<p>The party said in a statement that it would now seek to have its plans incorporated into a government plan due to be announced at the end of this month, Koukou Sato, head of the LDP's administrative reform committee, told a news conference.  </p>
<p>On the financial and securities systems, the LDP said it would:</p>
<p>- Conduct a review of possible changes in the securities transaction taxes for implemention in fiscal 1998/99.</p>
<p>- Urge liberalisation of brokerage commissions on stock transactions and call for a decision on this by June.</p>
<p>- Call for banks to be permitted to sell investment trust funds through their branch networks and for a decision on this by June.</p>
<p>- Call for brokers to be permitted to offer multi-service accounts and for a decision on this also by June.  </p>
<p>The party said it would also call for decisions by June on: - Allowing leasing and credit firms to issue bonds and commercial paper freely.</p>
<p>- Abolishing the current securities licence system.</p>
<p>On other regulations, it said it would:</p>
<p>- Seek an easing of regulations on commodity funds from 1997/98</p>
<p>- Call for an abolition of the &quot;5-3-3-2&quot; rule guiding investments by corporate pension funds in 1998/99.</p>
<p>The rule governs the total investment that a pension fund can make in a particular financial instrument. The rule stipulates that the funds may invest up to 50 percent of their funds in fixed-income instruments, up to 30 percent in domestic stocks, up to 30 percent in foreign-currency denominated instruments and up to 20 percent in real estate.  </p>
<p>- Allow resident borrowers to use medium-term note programmes to raise funds from the capital market by the end of fiscal 1997/98.</p>
<p>On land, the LDP said it would:</p>
<p>- Conduct an overall review of the land taxation system, including the holding and transaction taxes, with results of the review being implemented in fiscal 1998/99.</p>
<p>- Review raising the upper limit of the plot ratio -- the ratio of floor space to the plot of land -- and relaxing laws limiting building heights.</p>
<p>It said the government should work out specific steps to boost land transactions and promote effective use of land by the end of September.</p>
