<p>U.S. interest rate swap spreads pulled back slightly on Wednesday after making steady gains in the past few weeks, traders said.</p>
<p>Still, the 10-year area was better bid toward the close as repo rates tightened somewhat, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;Undoubtedly, some people felt like taking profits,&quot; a U.S. bank trader in California said of the mild pullback. &quot;It came off highs, but I think the market's pretty comfortable right here.&quot;</p>
<p>The 10-year spread, which had traded as wide as 39-1/2 basis points on Tuesday, traded mostly around 38-1/4 today.  </p>
<p>The 10-year maturity has gradually widened by about five basis points in the past two weeks or so after the U.S. Treasury scrapped sales of conventional 10-year notes in July and October.</p>
<p>Traders said the rest of the curve was little changed, perhaps with a slight consolidative tone.</p>
<p>A New York bank trader said the Treasury's $11.5 billion five-year note auction today and the $15.5 billion two-year note auction on Tuesday had virtually no impact on swap spreads. Two- and five-year spreads stood at 27/29 bps and 25/28 bps, little changed on the day.  </p>
<p>The five-year note auction produced a high yield of 6.298 percent, at which 87 percent of the bids were awarded, with a bid-to-cover ratio at 3.19 times. Tuesday's two-year notes saw a high yield of 6.027 percent, at which 90 percent were awarded, and a bid-to-cover of 2.46 times.</p>
<p>A late slide in the Treasury bond market today had negligible effect on swap rates, traders said.</p>
<p>The California trader said daily fluctuations in government bond yields, which have not been more than several basis points lately, &quot;don't really change the fundamentals of the swaps market.&quot;</p>
