<title>SINGAPORE: Amcol rescue gets Stock Exchange nod.</title>
<headline>Amcol rescue gets Stock Exchange nod.</headline>

<p>OCBC Bank Ltd said on Friday that Asia Food &amp; Properties Ltd (AFP) had made a conditional takeover offer for all ordinary shares in troubled property and finance firm Amcol Holdings Ltd.</p>
<p>OCBC said AFP was the vehicle which Indonesian white knight PT Sinar Mas Tunggal (SMT) would use to bail out the ailing firm.</p>
<p>The deal, including a listing in Singapore in U.S. dollars, has gained approval in principle from the Stock Exchange of Singapore, OCBC said in a statement.  </p>
<p>AFP holds the food processing and distribution assets of the Sinar Mas group and is a unit of British Virgin Islands-registered Flambo International Ltd, whose capital is held in a beneficial trust for Indonesia's Widjaja family.</p>
<p>OCBC said the takeover would be effected by a share transfer scheme in which four new AFP shares would be offered for every three Amcol shares and one AFP warrant for every 10 offer shares held.</p>
<p>The deal announced by OCBC completes the Sinar Mas rescue plan announced in August 1996 by Amcol's judicial managers, Price Waterhouse.  </p>
<p>Amcol was placed in judicial management on July 25, 1996 when the High Court agreed to an application made by three of its creditor banks -- OCBC, OUB Bank and Bank of China -- after Amcol announced it faced severe cash flow difficulties and could not service its debts.</p>
<p>Price Waterhouse said Amcol had liabilities of Singapore $1.16 billion as at May 31 1996 and had total assets of S$1.55 billion.</p>
