<p>Israel's parliament approved on Wednesday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's appointment of independent lawyer Yaacov Neeman as finance minister.</p>
<p>A former Treasury director-general, Neeman was Netanyahu's surprise choice over ex-general Ariel Sharon, a champion of West Bank Jewish settlement whose candidacy rattled Arabs and Israel's ally the United States.</p>
<p>Parliament also approved the Likud party's Michael Eitan, a Netanyahu loyalist, as science minister.</p>
<p>The Israeli leader insisted the appointments put an end to a three-week crisis in his squabbling cabinet and vowed to get down to making policy.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that the obstacles that stood in our path have been removed,&quot; Netanyahu told reporters after the 52-46 vote.</p>
<p>&quot;We can now set out on the main work for which we were elected -- to continue the political process and the search for peace and security...and to continue the economic revolution through which we are leading the country.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said that Netanyahu's appointments now gave him a much more loyal cabinet but that by snubbing Sharon he had made a dangerous enemy within his own party.</p>
<p>Neeman's appointment was designed to defuse a government crisis sparked by the resignation of Netanyahu's Likud arch-rival Dan Meridor, who vacated the finance post in a power struggle over foreign exchange policy.</p>
<p>Sharon was tipped to win the Treasury and had also demanded he be included in an inner &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; which hashes out Arab-Israeli peace strategy. His bid was thwarted by Foreign Minister David Levy, who forced Netanyahu to grant him formal control of peace talks and scrap the inner cabinet.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, tossing Sharon an olive branch, said he would advise him on security issues. &quot;We will continue to work together and coordinate together with cooperation and mutual agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>The two men met briefly for the first time since Neeman was selected as finance minister on Monday, triggering reports the burly Sharon was fuming at being shunted aside.</p>
<p>Sharon praised the Neeman appointment but declined comment when asked whether he expected Netanyahu would indeed involve him in national security discussions.</p>
<p>Investors expressed relief Sharon, who has a budget-busting reputation, was passed over for the Treasury post.</p>
<p>While denying Sharon the power to control budgets for pet projects such as Jewish settlements in occupied Arab lands is certain to go over well with Arabs and Israel's key U.S. ally, Neeman, although officially unaffiliated, is ideologically identified with the pro-settlement National Religious Party.</p>
