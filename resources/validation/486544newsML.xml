<p>Resource-rich Kazakhstan wants to become one of the world largest oil producers and is targeting output of 170 million tonnes (3.4 million barrels per day) by 2010, the head of the state oil company said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;By 2008-2010 we plan to achieve the level of 170 million tonnes of oil a year, which will make Kazakhstan the world's sixth largest oil producer,&quot; Kazakh Oil chairman Nurlan Balgimbayev told a news conference. &quot;But this amount of oil is unobtainable without a massive influx of foreign investment.&quot;</p>
<p>Output was 23 million tonnes or 460,000 bpd in 1996.</p>
<p>Foreign investment in Kazakhstan's oil sector is around $2 billion so far, but Balgimbayev said outside investors had already committed to investing another $40 billion.</p>
<p>He said the former Soviet republic was planning to boost oil output to 26.5 million tonnes (530,000 bpd) this year, returning to the Central Asian state's Soviet-era levels.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan is now the world's 26th largest oil producer.</p>
<p>&quot;It is obvious today that Kazakhstan has become a recognised oil country,&quot; said Balgimbayev, adding that the country had reserves of over three billion tonnes of oil.</p>
<p>&quot;Work in the (Kazakh sector of the) Caspian Sea shelf could bring in another $100 billion of foreign investment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>U.S.-based Chevron Corp and Mobil Corp are in a $20 billion project to tap Kazakhstan's giant Tengiz oil field, where production is already about 160,000 bpd and will peak at 700,000 bpd by 2010. Tengiz has estimated reserves of at least six billion barrels.</p>
