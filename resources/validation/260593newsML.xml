<p>Merrill Lynch and Co Inc expects a steep decline in corporate earnings growth in 1997 and increasingly favors bonds over stocks as an investment opportunity, the firm's top strategist said on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Merrill's Chief Economist Donald Straszheim said the firm &quot;did not see any end to the current expansion&quot; but later added &quot;our greatest concern is wage inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The equity markets are not going to have quite the tailwind of earnings,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said he expected earnings growth for the S&amp;P 500 of about 2.5 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Merrill Chief Investment Strategist Charles Clough said because of the weakening profit picture &quot;we have a growing preference for bonds over stocks.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;The risk is earnings and how that works through stock prices,&quot; Clough said.</p>
<p>Clough said inventories could be a bigger problem in 1997.</p>
<p>He said the firm continues to recommend an asset allocation of 40 percent stocks, 50 percent bonds and 10 percent cash.</p>
<p>Merrill Chief Market Analyst Richard McCabe said based on technical indicators the market &quot;appears vulnerable to an interim cyclical decline in 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>He added however such a sell-off would correct internal excesses in the market and &quot;set the stage for the next bull market phase in the 1998 to 2000 period.&quot;  </p>
<p>Merrill Economist Straszheim said one factor that should favor financial markets next year is low global inflation.  He said the firm expected world inflation of 3.7 percent next year, the lowest since the first oil shock in 1973.  </p>
<p>Merrill estimates 1996 S&amp;P 500 earnings growth of 6.1 percent. Both the 1996 and 1997 estimates relate to operating earnings, the firm's chief economist said.</p>
<p>Merrill Economist Straszheim said that with rising wages, &quot;because companies will be unable to push through price increases, the resulting squeeze will be felt in margins.&quot;  </p>
<p>Stocks that are poised to outperform the market next year include those in the financial and energy sectors, as well as selected technology stocks, Merrill strategist Clough said.</p>
