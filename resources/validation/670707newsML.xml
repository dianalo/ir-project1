<p>German politicians and central bankers claimed victory on Wednesday in overcoming efforts to dilute Europe's single currency and hailed the European Union's Amsterdam summit for putting monetary union back on track.</p>
<p>Germans conceded that the deal agreed at the EU summit this week fell short of its goals, but they breathed a sigh of relief that they were able to prevent efforts to weaken the future European central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The Amsterdam treaty has made the European Union more weatherproof. The house of Europe has gained a firm basis with the stability pact,&quot; said Peter Hintze, general secretary of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU).</p>
<p>&quot;Chancellor Helmut Kohl played a key role in shaping the architecture of the treaty. The EU summit is his personal success,&quot; Hintze said in a statement.</p>
<p>France's new Socialist-led government threatened to block the EU &quot;stability pact,&quot; which commits countries joining economic and monetary union (EMU) to tight budgets, saying it should put more emphasis on tackling unemployment.</p>
<p>But Germany got its way in Amsterdam in keeping unchanged the pact, which was agreed by EU leaders six months ago. Bonn feels this is vital to persuade sceptical Germans that the euro will be as strong as the mark that it is supposed to replace.</p>
<p>Germany's opposition Social Democrats complained that the Treaty of Amsterdam fell short of expectations in areas such as institutional reforms, but the party would still approve the treaty in parliament because it furthered European integration.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel said he would meet Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer on Thursday to iron out details of a compromise with the central bank over revaluation of its reserves to help plug budget deficits.</p>
<p>The German central bank wasted no time in defending its anti-inflation crusade that is meant to be a model for the euro.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer dismissed suggestions the independent central bank had aggravated unemployment. His remark seemed to be directed at French criticism that EU leaders had failed to put jobs at the heart of EU policy.</p>
<p>&quot;There is absolutely no contradiction between the stability pact and the goal of conquering joblessness,&quot; Tietmeyer told a news briefing in Cologne.</p>
<p>Germany has enjoyed low interest rates for several years and Bundesbank officials say structural problems and the high cost of labour are fuelling Germany's record unemployment, not interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;An increase in jobs cannot be expected from long-term higher inflation rates,&quot; Tietmeyer said. &quot;Only a durable, successful currency union with a stable currency and without greater conflicts can move Europe forward.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bundesbank recently saw off an attempt by the Bonn government to force it to revalue its gold reserves. This could have helped the government to cut its budget deficit to three percent of GDP, a target for would-be EMU members.</p>
<p>In Amsterdam EU leaders also agreed to adopt an Employment Chapter and to coordinate economic and employment policies.</p>
<p>The stability pact allows fines for EMU participants which run up high deficits and allow high inflation.</p>
<p>After overcoming two recent dangers to EMU -- a threat to the stability pact and the consequences of Bonn's grab for Bundesbank gold -- attention is returning to Germany's efforts to meet the entry criteria for EMU.</p>
<p>Waigel, Europe's staunchest advocate of a strict interpretation of the Maastricht criteria, said Germany was set to meet all but the limit on public debt to 60 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>&quot;We in Germany can meet (the criteria) with a slight overshooting of the debt criterion,&quot; Waigel told reporters.</p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Franz-Christoph Zeitler called for clear, credible fulfilment of Maastricht Treaty criteria.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the states have agreed on three percent, they must, in the interests of credibility, stick to that goal,&quot; he told reporters at a conference in Augsburg.</p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Peter Schmidhuber said the debate about softening entry criteria for European currency union or delaying the start was &quot;premature and damaging.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is premature and damaging because it lessens efforts to consolidate (budgets) and, at worst, can have the effect of a self-fulfilling prophecy,&quot; he said in text of a speech.</p>
<p>Schmidhuber said the start of European economic and monetary union should not be hampered by political concesssions, which he said could endanger the whole project.</p>
<p>Bundesbank hardliners and Finance Minister Theo Waigel are increasingly under fire from economists and politicians.</p>
<p>Rolf Dumke of respected Ifo institute told a conference in Munich that the debate focused almost exclusively on the EMU debt and deficit criteria, and did not reflect reality.</p>
<p>Monetary criteria for inflation, exchange rates and long-term interest rates carried far more weight. &quot;The price stability criteria are by far the most important,&quot; Dumke said.</p>
<p>Fred Bergsten, U.S. President Bill Clinton's adviser on foreign exchange matters, told a conference in Bonn that the debate about EMU criteria was misguided.</p>
<p>&quot;The European central bank will pursue a strong monetary policy that will ensure a strong euro,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>EMU members should be free to pursue flexible fiscal policies without fearing this would undermine the euro's strength, he said. In the early 1980s, the dollar was strong despite the massive Reagan-era fiscal deficits, he noted.</p>
