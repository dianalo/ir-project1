<title>SWEDEN: Swedish debt/currency market closing report.</title>
<headline>Swedish debt/currency market closing report.</headline>

<p>The crown rallied sharply against the German mark and bond yields fell sharply on mainly overseas demand on Wednesday, shrinking the Swedish yield spread over bunds to around its tightest levels this year.</p>
<p>Demand for Swedish bonds, firming since end-May amid broad overseas bullishness, helped the crown join a broad rally in Nordic currencies although trade was quite thin, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign players have dominated,&quot; one forex trader said. &quot;I think we've seen a lot of bond-related deals.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said a German bank bought crowns early, but the Swedish currency also drew strength from a firmer dollar.  </p>
<p>The yield spread over bunds shrank four basis points to 88 -- a level it touched earlier this week in a gentle catch-up that started in May. Before that it last visited the 88 area in January.</p>
<p>&quot;Swedish players are buying back bonds and foreigners are stepping into the market&quot;, a dealer said, adding that European markets are widely discounting a hike in key rates from the Bank of England on Thursday.</p>
<p>Auctions of SEK five bln apiece in six-month and 12-month T-bills went well, dealers said. Both were oversubcribed, with incoming bids amounting to 16 bln and 29 bln respectively.</p>
