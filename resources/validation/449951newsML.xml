<p>In an operation shrouded in secrecy, the highest North Korean official to flee the Stalinist state flew into the Philippines from China on Tuesday and was quickly whisked away to an undisclosed hideaway.</p>
<p>Senior military officials said Hwang Jang-yop, Pyongyang's top ideologue who had been marooned in Seoul's Beijing mission for nearly five weeks, arrived at the former U.S. Clark airbase near Manila.</p>
<p>He then boarded a military helicopter bound for the mountain resort city of Baguio, 200 km (125 miles) north of Manila, said the senior officers, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>The cloak-and-dagger nature of his flight, which could have come out of the pages of a Cold War spy novel, lingered for hours after his reported arrival in the Philippines.</p>
<p>There was no official confirmation that Hwang, accompanied by at least three other people, had arrived in Baguio.</p>
<p>President Fidel Ramos said he had no information on the matter. &quot;No, I have not received a report,&quot; Ramos said, adding: &quot;I will verify that and later on, whatever be the result, we will have the Department of Foreign Affairs issue a statement.&quot;</p>
<p>Foreign Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino, who cancelled a news briefing, said: &quot;I am waiting for orders.&quot;</p>
<p>Days before Hwang's arrival, senior military officials cloaked his identity by telling officers chosen to protect him that a &quot;foreign investor is coming&quot;. One officer said: &quot;Only yesterday were we told who the investor is.&quot;</p>
<p>But a Filipino diplomat told Reuters: &quot;The military may be misleading you. Remember that this is a top security operation.&quot;</p>
<p>Beijing and Seoul both confirmed that Hwang, architect of North Korea's ruling ideology of strict self-reliance and 24th in the impoverished country's hierarchy, had left China but refused to say where he was taken.</p>
<p>&quot;What I can tell you is that through consultations among all sides, the problem has already basically been solved,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a news briefing in Beijing.</p>
<p>The official Xinhua news agency said Hwang had left China of his own free will after sheltering in Seoul's mission in Beijing since February 12 and had gone to an unspecified third country.</p>
<p>Hwang wanted to go to Seoul but Filipino diplomats said arrangements required him to be taken elsewhere first to minimise embarrassment to North Korea.</p>
<p>Military sources said Hwang could stay in the Philippines from three days to a week. On Monday, a senior Seoul official said Hwang would stay in a third country &quot;for a considerable period of time&quot; before coming to South Korea.</p>
<p>Officials fearing North Korean assassins wanted the life of Hwang shrouded his clandestine escape from Beijing in clouds of rumour and a smokescreen of confusion.</p>
<p>The plot started to thicken early on Monday amid rumours that Hwang had left Seoul's mission in Beijing on Sunday.</p>
<p>A late-night Sunday convoy of three minibuses, their windows blackened, appeared to have been a rehearsal for the evacuation the following night of Hwang and his assistant from the heavily guarded South Korean consulate.</p>
<p>At about 8.00 p.m. on Monday, the three buses with their darkened windows drove slowly out from the diplomatic quarter of Beijing, driving around the armoured personnel carriers, traffic bollards and police carrying assault rifles who had guarded the mission since Hwang slipped in.</p>
<p>The 73-year-old senior aide to North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-il then spent the night at the military airport on the outskirts of Beijing before being flown out of the Chinese capital to the southeastern Chinese port of Xiamen.</p>
<p>There he boarded a chartered Air China plane to Clark.</p>
<p>China breathed a sigh of relief with Hwang spirited out.</p>
<p>His defection muddied ties between China and the two Koreas, bitter rivals since the 1950-1953 Korean War, and forced Beijing to choose between a new capitalist friend in the South and an old communist ally in the North.</p>
<p>North Korea at first accused Seoul of kidnapping the scholarly Hwang and sent scores of diplomats and students to keep vigil around Seoul's Beijing mission. But the Stalinist nation later appeared to ease its stance.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Pyongyang was silent about Hwang's movements.</p>
<p>At least three senior Philippine military officers confirmed Hwang arrived at Clark airbase, 80 km (50 miles) north of Manila, on the chartered Air China Boeing 737 jet from Xiamen.</p>
<p>Two officers who received Hwang and his companions said the group had snacks and stayed at the Clark terminal building for about half an hour before two helicopters whisked them away.</p>
<p>An army source earlier said the helicopters carrying Hwang's group were bound for Manila but checks failed to confirm this.</p>
<p>Devastated by an earthquake in 1992, Baguio hosts the presidential summer residence, a military academy and the Camp John Hay resort, a former U.S. military facility. Except for a lone guard, the presidential house appeared deserted on Tuesday.</p>
