<p>Istanbul shares slumped on Monday as concerns over the future of the Islamist-led coalition government mounted on remarks by a former cabinet minister, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100 closed down 48 points, or 3.33 percent at 1,395. Volume further retreated to 7.11 trillion lira ($52.1 million) from Friday's 8.83 trillion ($64.9 million).</p>
<p>&quot;It does not look like political uncertainty can be resolved in the short term. This caused investors to lose their hopes,&quot; said Ertan Gungor, assistant general manager of Tekstilbank.</p>
<p>&quot;The important point is that trade volume has dried up. Bulk of the investors hold shares at higher costs which are difficult to sell. They also shy away from buying new stocks,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Former health minister Yildirim Aktuna from the coalition's conservative wing said the the ruling alliance should be brought down with a confidence vote if it does not resign.</p>
<p>Aktuna had resigned from the cabinet in late April together with former industry and trade minister Yalim Erez in protest at the Islamists' reluctance to support a crackdown demanded by the secularist military on religious activism.</p>
<p>Erez is to hold a second ound of talks with opposition leaders this week on forming a secularist alliance excluding the Islamist Welfare Party of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.</p>
<p>Brokers said sentiment was further depressed by upward bond yields due to political uncertainty and poor economic indicators after higher-than-expected April inflation data released on May 4.</p>
<p>Turkey's foreign trade deficit rose 4.7 percent in the first quarter of 1997 to $4.133 billion, the State Statistics Institute said on Monday.</p>
<p>Erbakan said the budget, targeted to be balanced for 1997, gave a deficit of more than $1 billion in March, the Anatolian news agency reported on Monday.</p>
