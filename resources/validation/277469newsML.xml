<p>Jean-Marc Bosman may never have laced up a pair of skates in his life.</p>
<p>But nowhere have the effects of the ruling that now famously bears his name been felt more keenly than in Europe's ice hockey rinks.</p>
<p>A year on from the Bosman soccer case with all its implications on freedom of movement, Sweden has lost an estimated 60 ice hockey players this season. They can now be found scattered across Europe in leagues from Finland to Spain.</p>
<p>In turn, the number of foreigners playing in Sweden has almost doubled from about 33 to 59. Previously each club in Sweden was allowed three imports but this season AIK Stockholm has nine non-Swedes on its roster.</p>
<p>Sweden's Scandinavian rivals, the Finns, have also seen a jump in the number of foreign players in their elite division from 26 to 57. That number includes 27 Swedes which, given the fact that it was only two years ago that Michael Nylander became the first Swede to play there, speaks volumes for the changes.</p>
<p>The  upheaval has also created a new market for players from outside the European Union. Canadians, Americans and Russians are still classified as imports but no longer have to battle with Swedes and Finns for the few available spots.</p>
<p>In the German league (DEL), now considered the richest and most competitive league outside of North America, there are 146 players with non-German passports.</p>
<p>It employs players from 16 countries including 32 Italians, 14 Britons, two Danes and a Greek. Most of them, however, are Canadians or Americans with dual citizenships.</p>
<p>While Canadians with foreign passports have always been a valued commodity on the European hockey market, their worth has increased dramatically under the Bosman ruling allowing them to compete in any EU country as a non-import.</p>
<p>The biggest loser has been the Italian league which has been all but wiped out. The ruling triggered a stampede of Italos (Canadian hockey players with Italian passports) across the border to the lucrative DEL and now, unable to compete in the new market, the league's first division has been reduced to just two teams -- Milan and Bolzano.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some problems in Italy and Austria,&quot; admits International Ice Hockey Federation president Rene Fasel. &quot;A lot of Italians moved to Germany and now there aren't many teams left, we must find a compromise.&quot;</p>
<p>Ironically, while the quality of play in the DEL has benefited from the influx of foreign talent, some people believe that the open borders will only hurt the game in Germany. One of those is George Kingston, coach of the German national team which qualified for the final round of the recent World Cup, while Cologne coach Bob Murdoch is another.</p>
<p>&quot;In the immediate run it's tough on the national programme because a lot of German players lost jobs this year,&quot; says Murdoch. &quot;There are some people, like George, who believe the DEL has now become a development league for the Italian national team.&quot;</p>
<p>Like soccer, the biggest problem facing ice hockey leagues across Europe is who will be responsible -- and how -- for developing players without revenue from transfer fees.</p>
<p>&quot;People are saying with all the changes, who the hell is going to develop players,&quot; said Bill Gilligan, manager of Berne in Switzerland.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a complicated situation. When you put 10 years into developing a player you should be able to get something back but you can't make them slaves. We have to find a middle ground but we haven't yet.&quot;</p>
