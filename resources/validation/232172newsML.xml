<title>UK: Dollar boosts Eurobourses, gold slides.</title>

<p>The dollar surged to a near two-year high against the mark on Tuesday, powering German shares to yet another record and the Paris bourse to its highest levels this year.</p>
<p>British stocks also overcame some of their interest rate jitters to recoup Monday's fall on the back of a strong bond market and Wall Street's overnight rebound from a near 50-point deficit to a flat close.</p>
<p>Gold hit its lowest level in three years, being fixed at $369.00 an ounce. It was off its overnight lows but traders forecast it could go even lower with mining companies desperate to sell.</p>
<p>The dollar steadied just below its 23-month highs in Europe after making impressive gains overnight on comments from two central bank officials.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange markets were galvanised by Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing saying investors might want to switch into dollars in the runup to Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>New York Federal Reserve Bank President William McDonough said he believed the dollar might become more important as a reserve currency in the runup to EMU in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar's status as a reserve currency has dwindled in the last 15 years...But that has halted ahead of EMU,&quot; Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said.</p>
<p>The mark's softness against both the dollar and yen will please the French. They have argued for a dollar rise against the mark which would feed through into a more competitive franc.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bundesbank wants a weaker deutschemark. They need a weaker deutschemark,&quot; Lyons said.</p>
<p>By 1015 GMT the dollar was quoted at 1.5653 marks and 114.07 yen against 1.5428 marks and 113.68 yen in late Europe on Monday.</p>
<p>On European stock markets, Germany's 30-share DAX index stormed to a fresh record at the opening on the rise of the dollar which makes German exports more competitive.</p>
<p>The DAX started at a high of 2,892.57, then pared its gains slightly to trade up 32.52 points at 2,891.12 by 1015 GMT.</p>
<p>Carmaker Volkswagen inched up a few marks after falling nearly five percent on Monday on worries about its legal dispute with General Motors over allegations of industrial espionage.</p>
<p>The dollar and strong bond markets were also behind a strong rally in French shares, which surged nearly 28 points, or 1.2 percent, to around their best levels this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise may look excessive but if you look at it objectively, Paris is lagging the other European markets, particularly Frankfurt, where the gap is 500 points,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The advance was broadly based, with recent market underperformers leading the move forward. Schneider shares were up 2.04 percent, while LVMH rose 2.4 percent and Michelin was up 2.43 percent.</p>
<p>In London the FTSE 100 index of leading shares was well ahead but off its highs by 1015 GMT. Traders said there were lingering worries about the strength of sterling and a possible rise in interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The strength of sterling has been absolutely frightening and it has left the equity market wondering what to do next,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1015 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.5653 marks and 114.07 yen against 1.5428 marks and 113.68 yen in late Europe on Monday.</p>
