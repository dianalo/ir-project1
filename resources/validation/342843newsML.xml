<p>American Airlines pilots picketed airports across the United States on Tuesday, warning passengers that a lengthy strike at the nation's second-largest airline could begin Feb. 15.</p>
<p>The Allied Pilots Association, stuck in a bitter contract dispute with management, began &quot;informational picketing&quot; at nine airports Tuesday afternoon and said they would bring the airline to a standstill unless their wage demands were met.</p>
<p>Hundreds of pilots handed out leaflets explaining their demands and encouraged passengers to make alternative travel arrangements for the second half of February and beyond rather than risk being stranded.</p>
<p>&quot;Our pilots will strike, and they will strike for as long as it takes to get a fair settlement,&quot; union President Jim Sovich told reporters as he kicked off picketing at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. He said he expected any strike to last between 30 and 60 days.</p>
<p>Similar picket lines were set up at major airports in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, although no services can be interrupted until a full-blown strike is declared.</p>
<p>Union members earlier this month rejected a tentative labour contract that would have given them a 5 percent pay raise over four years, and are now demanding more than 11 percent as well as improved stock options and guarantees that their jobs will not be outsourced.</p>
<p>American Airlines, which is owned by Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp. says the pilots' demands are excessive and would cripple the company, threatening its plans for modest growth. They include an order for 103 jets worth $6.5 billion which was placed with Boeing Co. last November but which has now been put on hold.</p>
<p>&quot;Even worse, the very fabric of this company could be torn apart by a strike,&quot; President Don Carty said Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said the pilots' new demands would cost American an additional $200 million per year, and urged the union in a letter to accept binding arbitration.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe arbitration is the only rational solution to the dilemma,&quot; Carty told a news conference. &quot;If they are confident in their position, they should have absolutely no concern about arbitrating the matter.&quot;</p>
<p>Sovich, however, said the union was opposed to binding arbitration, which he said could last up to two years, and that the union's principal demands were seen by members as an absolute minimum.</p>
<p>&quot;We want that much pay. Period,&quot; Sovich said. &quot;If they are not willing to meet our demands, i believe it (a strike) is unavoidable.&quot;</p>
<p>The National Mediation Board declared an impasse in the negotiations two weeks ago and placed both sides in a 30-day &quot;cooling off&quot; period which ends at midnight on Feb. 14.</p>
<p>Airline and union negotiators are scheduled to begin five days of last-ditch negotiations on Feb. 10. Under federal law, if no agreement is reached, the union will be allowed to strike and the airline can impose a lockout starting on Feb. 15.</p>
<p>Both sides insist they want a negotiated solution to the dispute but concede that they are far apart on some of the major issues.</p>
