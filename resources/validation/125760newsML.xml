<p>The Warsaw bourse fell this week, on profit-taking after its 11.1-percent rise since early September, and analysts saw it extending the downtrend but with a possible rebound later next week.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe we will still have falls but the profit-taking correction is unlikely to be a very deep one, with a possible rebound or stabilisation later,&quot; said Wojciech Kossuth, an analyst at Bank Slaski brokerage.</p>
<p>The WIG index fell 1.4 percent this week to 14,718.4 points since the previous Friday close. Analysts did not expect the index to decline below 14,400 or 14,000.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch earlier said price growth on the Warsaw exchange should slow over the fourth quarter after the bourse's surge of about 95 percent this year.</p>
<p>Nomura said the bourse was vulnerable to selling pressure as international investors start taking profits.</p>
<p>But some Polish analysts did not agree with these views.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is definitely not undervalued, although it's not overheated either,&quot; said Kossuth of Bank Slaski.</p>
<p>Others said a downtrend was now possible, but only if the bourse received a strong negative signal.</p>
<p>&quot;The risk of a profit-taking correction after the rise since the beginning of the year is higher every week, but I don't believe this will happen unless there is a strong negative signal,&quot; said Stanislaw Kutkowski of WBK brokerage.</p>
<p>Traders said the sacking of Alexander Lebed as national security adviser in Russia was unlikely to influence the Warsaw bourse but said that any deepening of the political conflict there could harm Polish stocks.</p>
<p>Analysts said Bank Ochrony Srodowiska SA (BOS), which starts its public offering on Monday and seeks a main-market bourse listing in January, is likely to draw some capital from shares, which could undermine bourse prices.</p>
<p>They said the BOS issue of about 35 million zlotys was expected to be heavily oversubscribed.</p>
<p>Analysts said some stocks' performance early next week might be influenced by their earnings reports for September, due after the market's close on Friday.</p>
<p>NFI units fell 10.3 percent this week, after growing about 90 percent since late August, but analysts saw them rebounding soon.</p>
<p>&quot;The cooling on the NFI market seems natural to me, but I believe they still have growth potential,&quot; said WBK trader Kutkowski.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the units might rise up to 200 zlotys.</p>
<p>The week's biggest losers were Rafako , which fell 15.7 percent to 15 zlotys and Paged which fell 10.7 percent to 19.4 zlotys.</p>
<p>Prochnik , the week's top gainer, rose 10.4 percent to 10.6 zlotys.</p>
