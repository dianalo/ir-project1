<p>India's exports dipped in the April-June  quarter because of a strong rupee, depressed global markets and poor  infrastructure, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Commerce Ministry reported that exports fell by 0.95 percent to  $8.13 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 1997/98 (April-March)  from $8.21 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;It is definitely a cause for worry,&quot; said Bidisha Ganguly, an economist  with securities firm W.I. Carr.</p>
<p>Ganguly said the government had to give a &quot;big push&quot; to spur exports.</p>
<p>Exports in June rose by a niggardly 2.53 percent to $2.66 billion  from $2.59 billion in June 1996.</p>
<p>Analysts said exports of gems, jewellery and leather goods, some of  India's principal items, had been plagued by internal problems.</p>
<p>&quot;Corporates will have to rethink their strategy and build up exports,&quot;  V. Raghuraman, secretary general of Associated Chambers of Commerce  (Assocham), told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;With the appreciation of the rupee (against the dollar) and depreciation  of the currency in some of the surrounding countries there will be  some anxieties among the exporters,&quot; Raghuraman said.</p>
<p>Exporters also complain that the rupee, which has been trading in  the range of 35.70-35.90 to the dollar for the past year, is overvalued  and affecting competitiveness in a depressed global market.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India had to intervene regularly to stop the rupee  from appreciating as foreign investors bought rupees with dollars.</p>
<p>Imports in April-June increased by 4.22 percent to $9.53 billion from  $9.15 billion in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Oil imports dropped 9.89 percent to $2.06 billion from $2.28 billion  in the corresponding period a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic oil production is increasing,&quot; Ganguly said, when asked  for reasons for the fall in oil imports.</p>
<p>India's crude oil output during April-June 1997 rose to 8.40 million  tonnes from 8.17 million tonnes in the same period in 1996, a Petroleum  Ministry document obtained by Reuters on Thursday said.</p>
<p>Non-oil imports grew 8.42 percent to $7.47 billion in April-June 1997  from $6.86 in the same period in 1996, the Commerce Ministry said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is positive and shows signs of a revival of industrial growth,&quot;  Raghuraman said.</p>
<p>Industrial output rose 9.8 percent in April compared with 8.1 percent  in same month in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Infrastructure bottlenecks continue to a major problem affecting  industrial growth. This also affects imports,&quot; Raghuraman said.</p>
<p>India, which launched an economic liberalisation programme in 1991,  estimates it needs some $150 billion in investment over five years  to build infrastructure facilties like power plants, ports, roads  and telecommunications.</p>
