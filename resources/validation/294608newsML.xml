<title>USA: Disabled oil tanker towed to port in Valdez.</title>

<p>A disabled oil tanker was guided by three escort vessels into port at the Valdez marine terminal of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline Tuesday, state officials said.</p>
<p>The Chevron Mississippi, which was headed into port to receive a load of oil, experienced steering trouble near the mouth of Prince William Sound, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) said.</p>
<p>After the oil tanker was docked safely, state officials started an investigation of the problem. State and U.S. Coast Guard officials will ensure that the steering problem is fixed before the tanker is allowed to load its cargo and depart from the terminal, DEC said.</p>
<p>Although the vessel had been carrying no crude oil, it had a large volume of bunker oil that was being used as fuel, DEC said.</p>
<p>The escort system was mandated by state and federal laws after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. New state rules call for more manouverable tugs to be used in the escort system.</p>
<p>&quot;The department has been aggressively working with industry to upgrade the tanker escort system to capably assist disabled tankers. This event again illustrates the need to have the correct escort capacity,&quot; DEC Commissioner Michele Brown said in a news release.</p>
