<p>New Zealand share prices closed weaker on Monday but volumes were typically light and brokers said the market should still benefit from lower interest rates in the medium term.</p>
<p>&quot;As time goes on we'd expect to see those short rates come down more and hopefully that freed-up cash will feed through into the equity market,&quot; said Tim Koller at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 5.01 points weaker at 2,252.30, with most leading stocks a few cents weaker. Brokers said a four cent fall in Carter Holt Harvey to NZ$3.15 was simply a correction after its good recent run.  </p>
<p>Cultus Petroleum shot to a new all-time high of $3.55 before settling at $3.48, up 26 cents on the day.</p>
<p>On Thursday Cultus told Reuters it expected to double first half profits in the second half and said it would spud several new &quot;wildcat&quot; oil wells this year, which could see a substantial earnings improvement over the next few years.</p>
<p>Cultus said it believed its Maari oilfield, offshore Taranaki in New Zealand, could produce 100 million barrels, making it one the country's largest oilfields. It was hoped drilling could start in November or December.  </p>
<p>Publisher Wilson and Horton, which launched the revamped business section of its flagship newspaper the New Zealand Herald on Monday, gained 10 cents to $11.50.</p>
<p>The company will hold its AGM in Auckland later this week. However, brokers said there was little to stimulate the wider market at present.</p>
<p>&quot;On the domestic front, we'll be waiting to see the economy pick up a little bit, which would obviously help company profitability, but ... it's really a monetary easing that we would hope will give the market a bit of a boost,&quot; Koller said.</p>
