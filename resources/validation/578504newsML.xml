<p>Mediterranean oil product markets failed to catch up with crude's gains on Tuesday and traded thinly amid tight supply, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gasoline was firm in a tight market with fair Italian demand lending support. An Italian refiner was heard to have bought an unleaded premium cargo from a French refiner.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it will remain fairly tight at least until the end of May,&quot; said one trader. &quot;We're still seeing the effects of maintainence programmes.&quot;</p>
<p>Suitable gasoline vessels for intra-Med journeys remained scarce with bad weather baving delayed loadings at some ports.</p>
<p>Naphtha remained sloppy in the near-term, but a number of traders foresaw a tightening in the market as June approached</p>
<p>Gas oil prices were unchanged to slightly weaker.</p>
<p>Traders said supplies were growing as expected with refiners coming out of maintenance and the arbitrage east closed.</p>
<p>Premiums to benchmark quotes for tighter Russian 0.2 pct cargoes were talked slightly weaker at around benchmark quotes high +$1 cif Genoa.</p>
<p>Premiums for well supplied EN590 remained soft at fob high EN590 quotes +$1.50-$2 a tonne with buying interest thin.</p>
<p>Fuel oil markets were calm.</p>
<p>Traders were believed working high sulphur cargoes to the Far East and bunker demand was expected to bolster prices in the near-term.</p>
<p>&quot;There is quite a lot of demand for better quality fuel oil in both east and west Med and not much supply,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>As in north-west Europe much business was on hold while players assessed the durability of crude's dramatic recent rise.</p>
<p>Refiners were said not to have woken up to the relative attrativeness of Russian straight-run material, which was well supplied but garnering little interest. Sellers were reluctant to push into the bunker market for now.</p>
