<p>India's Himalayan region of Kashmir began voting on Saturday in its first local elections since a violent separatist revolt erupted six years ago.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of security officers were deployed around polling stations, which authorities said opened at 7.00 a.m. (0130 GMT) under overcast skies.</p>
<p>There were no early reports of violence in Jammu and Kashmir state but aides said several separatist leaders were either in detention or were in hospital.</p>
<p>Some 1.3 million voters in 26 of 87 constituencies in the state were eligible to vote on Saturday. Polling stations were due to close at 5.00 p.m. (1130 GMT).</p>
<p>Voting in remaining constituencies will be spread over three days -- September 16, 21 and 30 -- to enable election officials and some 200,000 security personnel to move between regions.</p>
<p>Final results were expected in early October.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have died in insurgency-related violence since the rebellion started in early 1990.</p>
<p>The last state assembly was dissolved in 1990 to allow New Delhi to impose direct rule and move thousands of paramilitary troops into the state to try to quell the insurgency. It was elected in 1987 amid widespread allegations of rigging.</p>
<p>Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged routine fire on Saturday along the line of control in western Poonch district, an Indian defence spokesman said. Firing is routine in the area but it intensified slightly on Saturday, he said, adding that Pakistani gunners were using small arms and mortar shells.</p>
<p>Pakistan and India have fought two of their three wars since independence in 1947 over the region. Pakistan controls one third of Kashmir and has staked a claim over the rest.</p>
<p>On Saturday, several separatist leaders were detained by Indian authorities or were in hospital, their aides said.</p>
<p>The home of Shabir Shah, sometimes called the &quot;Nelson Mandela of Kashmir&quot;, was surrounded by police and paramilitary troopers, aide Altaf Ahmad told Reuters.</p>
<p>Two leaders of the All Parties Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, Abdul Gani Lone and Syed Ali Shah Geelani, were detained by authorities in north Kashmir, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>The president and vice-president of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, Yasin Malik and Jawed Mir, were in hospital in the state's summer capital, Srinagar, with multiple bruises.</p>
<p>They said army soldiers had beaten them on Friday. An army spokesman denied the claim.</p>
<p>Hurriyat leaders have been touring the mostly Moslem Kashmir Valley urging voters to boycott the polls.</p>
<p>Dozens of militant organisations are fighting either for independence or merger with Pakistan, which New Delhi accuses of arming and training guerrillas. Islamabad denies the charge.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's centre-left government in New Delhi hopes the restoration of democracy will help to end militancy in mostly Hindu India's only Moslem majority state.</p>
<p>&quot;A popular government will lead to greater peace,&quot; state chief secretary Ashok Kumar said.</p>
<p>Some guerrilla groups have threatened to disrupt the polls, being held four months after general elections that were marred by allegations security forces and pro-government militants had coerced some people into voting. Authorities denied this.</p>
<p>London-based rights group Amnesty International said on Friday abuses in Kashmir &quot;could reach a new peak&quot; during voting.</p>
<p>The largest pro-India party, the National Conference, was tipped to win the elections.</p>
<p>Party leader and former chief minister Farooq Abdullah has called for the restoration of autonomous political status for the state and bilateral talks between India and Pakistan to resolve their long-standing differences over the region.</p>
