<title>MEXICO: Mexico stocks close lower in post-holiday slump.</title>
<headline>Mexico stocks close lower in post-holiday slump.</headline>

<p>Mexican stocks closed lower Friday in lackluster trading.</p>
<p>The blue-chip IPC index ended off 36.54 points, or 1.13 percent, at 3,205.21. Volume was lackluster at 76.7 million shares traded, many of which were cross trades.</p>
<p>Traders said the decline was a delayed reaction to 98-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average Thursday, when the Mexican markets were closed for a holiday. The Dow finished up 1.16 points at 6,304.87 Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The bourse was basically hit by the fall in the Dow. All it did was catch up on yesterday's holiday,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Analysts said a series of domestic and international factors combined to produce the slide in share prices.</p>
<p>&quot;A volatile Dow is hitting us still. Then there are forecasts that U.S. interest rate hikes will be announced at Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting,&quot; said Esteban Rojas, deputy head of research at the Arka brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;Also, December traditionally sees a spike in inflation and fuels concern that domestic interest rates will not thus be able to fall. And then there's social and political unease,&quot; Rojas said.</p>
<p>On the broad market, 99 stocks changed hands of which losers outweighed gainers by 72 to 12.</p>
<p>Warehousing firm Alsa headed the losers, off 12 centavos (2 cents) at 1.04 pesos (13 cents), as it had not traded since Nov. 29 and had thus lagged behind the market, dealers said. Publishers Gfesa led the gainers after gaining six centavos (1 cent) to 1.90 pesos (24 cents).</p>
<p>Technical analysts noted that the IPC probed an important psychological barrier at 3,200 points, but did manage to close above it.</p>
