<p>Recruitment and contract labour group Morgan and Banks Ltd said on Tuesday it was confident the wider trend to a more fluid labour market and firmer jobs growth would generate further signficant profit growth this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We're certainly a growth company and we're confident our growth will continue to be significant,&quot; Morgan and Banks joint managing director Andrew Banks told reporters after the group's annual meeting.</p>
<p>He had been asked if Morgan and Banks' could repeat the 46 percent profit growth seen in the year to March 31, 1997 in the current 1997/98 year.  </p>
<p>Morgan and Banks' profit rose to A$9.87 million in 1996/97, after sales rose 55 percent to A$221.5 million. It increased full year dividends to 26.5 cents per share from 19.0 cents on earnings per share of 43 cents.</p>
<p>Morgan and Banks' shares have outperformed the market this year, rising 48.7 percent to their current A$9.00 level since the beginning of January while the All Ordinaries Index has risen 14.05 percent.</p>
<p>Banks said the group saw most of its growth coming organically from existing businesses, particularly those offshore.  </p>
<p>Morgan and Banks has recruitment search operations in Australia, New Zealand and Britain and also owns 75 percent of an agency operating out of Singapore and Hongkong.</p>
<p>Banks said he expected about 35 percent of the group's revenues in the current year would come from offshore and it was hoped over 50 percent would come from offshore within five years.</p>
<p>&quot;We will do some acquisitions, but they will tend to be small and strategic, probably in offshore markets or in local markets where we go into a new sector like specialist engineering contractors,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Primarily our engines of growth are organic,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Increasingly flexible labour markets and the trend towards contracting out and using temporary staff would drive most of Morgan and Banks' growth, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;When you're riding a wave of structural change like that, it's silly to go out and just start making acquisitions for the sake of it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Employment growth was also likely to accelerate in Australia later this year, helping the recruitment sector.</p>
<p>Banks said the group was confident employment would be stronger in a year's time.  </p>
<p>Morgan &amp; Banks would focus on the time zone that included Australia and much of Asia, with the exception of Britain, where many Australasian professionals were placed.</p>
<p>The markets in Europe and the United States were very competitive and it was easier in an intensely service-oriented business like recruitment to service a market in the same time zone.</p>
<p>He said the prospects for growth in Asia were dramatic.</p>
<p>&quot;In Asia, I don't think we'll ever see the limit to Morgan and Banks' growth in my lifetime,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Asked about the prospect of a capital return given cash represented 71 percent of net assets at March 31, he said the group was comfortable with its gearing levels and its level of dividend return of up to 60 percent of earnings.</p>
<p>Morgan &amp; Banks needed high cash levels to service growth and seasonal shifts. &quot;I don't think we'd want to change our gearing, particularly as we're going to grow quickly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Morgan &amp; Banks' long term debt to shareholders equity ratio stood at 38 percent at March 31, 1997.</p>
<p>Its shares were up 10 cents at A$9.00 at 1.50 p.m. (0350 GMT). -- Bernard Hickey 61-2 9373-1812</p>
