<p>Photocopier maker Oce-van der Grinten NV said on Monday its 1995/96 net profit jumped 57 percent to 169.5 million guilders from 108.3 million, due in part to a major acquisition in Germany.</p>
<p>The company said it planned to raise its dividend to 3.00 guilders per share from 2.50 and that new product launches would contribute to a further improvement in earnings in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Full-year sales rose 42 percent to 4.17 billion guilders, with SNI Printing, acquired from Germany's Siemens AG last April, accounting for just under half of the increase.</p>
<p>SNI Printing -- bought for 900 million guilders -- posted sales of 731 million guilders from April to the end of Oce's 1995/96 financial year on November 30. Oce said SNI Printing had also made an important contribution to group profits.</p>
<p>Oce said sales of equipment to the engineering systems market rose by 15 percent to 1.37 billion guilders, mainly because of strong sales of high volume digital copiers.</p>
<p>It said digital machines now represented more than 70 percent of its sales in the engineering systems market.</p>
<p>Sales in the office systems market, including printers sold under Oce's own name, rose 19 percent to 2.08 billion guilders.</p>
<p>SNI Printing booked strong sales for its Pagestream printers which print at speeds of up to 700 pages per minute, it said.</p>
<p>Oce said that, barring unforeseen circumstances, it expected a further improvement in earnings in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;On the basis of its own strengths, Oce has expanded in all markets. The acquisition of SNI Printing has added a further important dimension to that expansion,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;This has established a solid basis for continued growth in sales and profitability. Further launches of machines in 1997 are expected to support that growth,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Oce said it would ask shareholders to approve a change in its official name to Oce NV from the more cumbersome Oce-van der Grinten NV.</p>
