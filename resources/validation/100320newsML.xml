<title>INDIA: Gold - Indian sub-continent prices seen steady.</title>
<headline>Gold - Indian sub-continent prices seen steady.</headline>
<dateline>BOMBAY 1996-10-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Inauspicious times in India and political uncertainty in Pakistan have reined in gold prices in the Indian sub-continent, dealers said on Monday.</p>
<p>Bombay dealers said a two-week inauspicious period, as indicated by the Hindu calendar, would end this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Most individuals normally do not buy gold during this period,&quot; said Jagdish Parekh, a leading jeweller.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold will attract fresh buying from next week onwards and remain in focus until the Diwali festival,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Renewed Indian demand for gold, expected from mid-October, normally peaks during the two-day Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, this time falling on November 9 and 10.</p>
<p>Parekh said a downtrend in international gold markets had also dampened Indian sentiment. On the Bombay bullion market, standard gold (24 carat) lost 10 rupees per 10 grammes to 5,110 rupees in the week to Monday.</p>
<p>Last week gold prices fell to an 18-month low of $377 per ounce in world markets but later recovered some lost ground.</p>
<p>&quot;Local prices are likely to follow international trends in limited trade in the current week,&quot; Parekh said.</p>
<p>Dealers in Pakistan's commercial city of Karachi said gold prices would remain steady this week on low demand due to political uncertainty.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors in gold have gone to the sidelines because of the poor economic outlook, shortage of funds and political uncertainty,&quot; said dealer Saeed Qureshi.</p>
<p>Pakistan's political situation has remained fluid after the recent killing of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's estranged brother, Murtaza Bhutto.</p>
<p>Gold traders were themselves buying dollars, partly because of fears of another devaluation of the Pakistani rupee, though there has been no official indication that this is imminent.</p>
<p>In Dubai, re-export gold market prices fell marginally last week and may trigger Indian import demand ahead of the festival season, dealers said. The Gulf emirate is the main feed supplier to India which is on course to buy 500 tonnes of gold this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand is steady, no particular improvement...the lower prices should attract buying but at the moment there is no rush,&quot; a Dubai trader said.</p>
