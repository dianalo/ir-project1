<p>High sulphur fuel oil prices on Tuesday were assessed steady to firm on overnight crude gains but thin talks as activity gradually draws to a halt towards the year end, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said prices were expected to rise above Monday's quotes at $119-$121 per tonne as overnight crude had jumped almost $1.00.</p>
<p>But some traders were skeptical, citing the softening of crude prices after the rally.  </p>
<p>In the swaps market, the prompt December paper was supported at $122.50/$123.50, up from Monday's $122.25 bid. But January swaps were quoted at $120/$121, slightly lower from $120.50/$122 on Monday.</p>
<p>One Singapore trader told Reuters he was keen to sell his Janaury lifting barrels but could not find any buyers.</p>
<p>But other traders agreed that Chinese oil demand continued healthy for January. They expected enquiries to slow at the end of the week.</p>
<p>Most South Korean barrels for January loading were heard to have been sold out.  </p>
