<p>Higher crude oil prices resulting from the U.N.'s suspension of Iraq's limited oil sale plan last week, are likely to boost returns from index-linked investments in commodities, which are already running higher than returns on equity-index investments in the past year, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Strong global economic demand and very low oil inventory levels support our forecast for 16 percent returns for the GSCI over the next 12 months,&quot; Goldman Sachs research director Steve Strongin said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Since the latest mid-cycle pause in mid-1995, the return on a GSCI (Goldman Sachs Commodities Index) investment has been 42.6 percent for the period June 30, 1995 to August 30, 1996, compared to a 23.2 percent return for the Standard and Poors 500 index,&quot; he noted.</p>
<p>Total returns on the two indices are calculated by rolling forward nearby futures contracts.</p>
<p>CME September Goldman Sachs Commodity Index futures were up 0.60 points at 203.10 midmorning Monday, as the recovery from July's correction to a two-year-old rally continued.  </p>
<p>September S&amp;P500 futures were up 1.45 points at 659.70, within the 640-680 range of the past two months, following the strong rally of the past year.</p>
<p>The GSCI, an index based on the prices of 22 U.S. traded commodities, has a 49 percent weighting in energy futures, based on world production data for commodities in the index.</p>
<p>The other benchmark U.S. commodity index, the Knight Ridder Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) index, allocates an 18 percent weighting to the energy sector, while giving agricultural commodities a 47 percent weighting.  </p>
<p>The CRB index was up 0.16 points at 247.79 early Monday, continuing its recovery from July's correction to a three year rally. New York Futures Exchange (NYFE) November CRB futures were down 0.05 points at 247.60.</p>
<p>Some major U.S. pension funds, such as General Motors Investment Management Corp and the Harvard and Stanford University endowments, have diversified their portfolios into commodities in recent years, guided by benchmark commodity indices, such as the GSCI and the CRB Index.</p>
<p>World real GDP is forecast to grow by 3.1 pct in 1996 and by 3.7 pct in 1997, the Goldman Sachs Economics Group said.  </p>
<p>Commodity markets traditionally tend to be strong during the latter part of economic expansions, while equity and bond markets tend to suffer, as inflation often becomes a threat late in the business cycle, analysts noted.</p>
<p>&quot;Our outlook also remains positive and it is anticipated that commodity prices will gradually firm as a group during the late summer and early fall period,&quot; Merrill Lynch senior futures strategist, Bill O'Neill said.</p>
<p>&quot;But this is likely to occur at a mostly non-inflationary pace, and with the possible exception of crude oil, we do not view commodities as a significant inflation factor,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>After the U.N. this week suspended its plan to allow a limited Iraqi return to world oil markets, following Iraq's incursion into Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, NYMEX nearby crude oil futures jumped to a high of $24.25 a barrel, not far from the five year highs at $25.70 seen in April following the colder-than-normal winter last year.</p>
<p>U.S. crude oil inventories of 313 million barrels have recovered from 20 year lows to more normal levels in the past few months. But distillate (heating oil) inventories, which usually build during the summer, have fallen to levels about 16 percent below last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The combination of low heating oil stocks and hand-to-mouth refining will likely drive up the demand for crude oil and leave these markets quite vulnerable to any disruption, generating the potential for significant investor returns to a rolling nearby futures investment in these markets,&quot; he said.</p>
