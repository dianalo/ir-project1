<headline>Apple rehires its old ad agency, TBWA Chiat/Day.</headline>
<dateline>CUPERTINO, Calif. 1997-08-08</dateline>

<p>Apple Computer Inc. confirmed Friday that it was reuniting with TBWA Chiat/Day, the advertising agency that created the highly acclaimed television commercial that launched the Macintosh personal computer in 1984.</p>
<p>Troubled Apple, which this week announced a stunning series of actions to turn itself around, said it selected TBWA Chiat/Day, a unit of Omnicom Group, to handle its U.S. advertising. The move would not immediately affect Apple's international advertising.</p>
<p>The size of the account was not disclosed, but trade publications put it in the $80 million to $90 million range.</p>
<p>Apple officials said it was too early to know what specific advertising messages will emerge but said marketing will focus on the company's traditional strengths in creative content and education.</p>
<p>&quot;We've tried to compete in too broad a space,&quot; David Roman, vice president of advertising and brand communications, said in a telephone interview. &quot;If we really focus on areas where we are unique, Apple is a driver in many spaces in the marketplace.&quot;</p>
<p>He cited graphics, publishing, design, multimedia authoring and Web authoring as the creative areas that would be highlighted in Apple's marketing.</p>
<p>Roman said the effort would also include expanding Apple's brand name.</p>
<p>&quot;We have one of the few brand names in the industry,&quot; he said. &quot;The issue is making it more relevant to where computing is going today.&quot;</p>
<p>Apple, which has seen its earnings and market share plummet in recent years, announced Wednesday that Microsoft Corp., its bitter arch-rival, was investing $150 million in the company and that Apple's board of directors was being revamped.</p>
<p>TBWA Chiat/Day is the successor to Chiat/Day, the agency that created the well-known &quot;1984&quot; commercial that launched the Macintosh PC.</p>
<p>The television spot, shown during the Super Bowl, portrayed a hammer-wielding woman athlete attacking a giant Orwellian video screen representing numbing conformity.</p>
<p>Apple began its review of advertising agencies in June. Its agency for U.S. advertising, BBDO Worldwide, declined to participate.</p>
<p>Apple's stock, which surged after Wednesday's announcements, lost $2.38 to $26.81 Friday on the Nasdaq market, where it was the third most-active issue.</p>
