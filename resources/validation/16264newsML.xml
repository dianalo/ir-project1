<p>South African apartheid killer Eugene de Kock, convicted of five murders on Monday, was found guilty on Tuesday of blowing up a black activist as well as the attempted murder of his former hit-squad boss.</p>
<p>Supreme Court Judge Willem van der Merwe said de Kock -- dubbed &quot;Prime Evil&quot; by his colleagues -- tried to kill his predecessor Dirk Coetzee, commander of a ruthless hit-squad unit based near Pretoria, which wiped out opponents of apartheid.</p>
<p>After Coetzee, who has claimed responsibility for several political assassinations ordered by apartheid chiefs, sang out in 1989 about the white government's death squads he himself became a target of the unit he had led until 1985.</p>
<p>Earlier in the trial a policeman tesitified that de Kock and others sent a package with tapes, headphones and explosives -- first tested on a pig's head -- to an address in Zambia where Coetzee, who had meanwhile joined Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, was supposed to fetch it.</p>
<p>But the post office sent the unopened deadly package, marked with ANC lawyer Bheki Mlangeni's return address, to the hit-squad investigator and killed him.</p>
<p>&quot;A reasonable man in de Kock's position would have seen it could have ended up in Mlangeni's care. He was negligent,&quot; van der Merwe said before convicting the bespectacled ex-colonel of culpable homicide.</p>
<p>The most senior servant of white rule to be convicted by a court, de Kock, was also found guilty of the 1991 murder of police informer Goodwill Sikhakhane, who was shot in the head.</p>
<p>&quot;I am satisfied the accused gave the order to murder,&quot; van der Merwe said.</p>
<p>The judge further convicted de Kock of conspiring to murder, defeating the ends of justice, eight fraud charges and the illegal possession of weapons. Van der Merwe was expected to complete his judgement on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>On Monday de Kock was found guilty of planning and executing the ambush and murder of five black men, including Winnie Mandela's driver.</p>
<p>The 12,000 pages of evidence and 3,000 exhibits compiled over nearly two years for his trial have provided a litany of the death and mayhem integral to the &quot;old&quot; South Africa.</p>
<p>The accusations included massacres and random killings, attacks on township hostels and trains, car bombings, torture, beatings and vendettas against fellow police.</p>
<p>Chappies Klopper, one of the 92 witnesses -- 30 of whom were de Kock's colleagues -- testified last year the Vlakplaas unit regularly used the &quot;Buddha&quot; method to destroy all evidence of their atrocities.</p>
<p>Buddha was Vlakplaas slang for repeatedly blowing up a corpse &quot;until there was nothing left to blow up&quot;.</p>
<p>De Kock, now 48, started his career as a killing machine 27 years ago as an ordinary policeman before fighting black liberation guerrillas in former white-led Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Back home, he formed a security police unit that tried to thwart the South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) in its fight for Namibian independence from South Africa and in 1980 he joined the now notorius Vlakplaas unit.</p>
<p>By the time he was arrested early in 1994 he had stashed millions of rand (dollars) in offshore banks.</p>
<p>South Africa abolished the death penalty in June 1995, and de Kock faces life imprisonment -- commonly 25 years -- on each murder charge.</p>
<p>But in return for evidence against his former cohorts, de Kock has applied to the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, requesting the amnesty it has the power to grant to those who committed human rights abuses but came clean.</p>
