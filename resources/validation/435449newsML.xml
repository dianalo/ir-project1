<p>Austrian Fritz Strobl outclassed the field to win the men's downhill at the World Cup Finals on Wednesday as French ace Luc Alphand failed to fortify his overall lead with a sluggish ninth-place finish.</p>
<p>Strobl, who rose to prominence this season with wins at Val d'Isere and Kitzbuehel, streaked down the 2,704-metre Vail Mountain course in one minute, 38.29 seconds for a comfortable victory over Italian Kristian Ghedina and Austrian Hannes Trinkl.</p>
<p>Ghedina, who finished the season standings in second place ahead of Strobl, was 0.37 of a second behind in 1:38.66 with Trinkl two-hundredths of a second slower on a warm, sunny day.</p>
<p>Werner Franz, Josef Strobl and Andreas Schifferer completed the top six for a strong showing by the Austrian team.</p>
<p>Alphand, whose four victories this season had already clinched for him a third successive World Cup downhill title, was a full second slower than Strobl at 1:39.29.</p>
<p>The Frenchman, striving for an historic World Cup overall title, failed to take advantage of a chance to pad his lead over Norway's 1994 overall champion Kjetil Andre Aamodt.</p>
<p>Aamodt finished 11th but has a chance to win points in the remaining three races here, while Alphand's only other chance to pick up points is expected to come in Thursday's Super-G.</p>
<p>Alphand, who now leads Aamodt by 122 points in the standings, is trying to become the first Frenchman since Jean-Claude Killy to win the overall World Cup crown and the first speed specialist ever to claim the title.</p>
