<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss Cabinet recommends VAT increase in 1999.</title>
<headline>Swiss Cabinet recommends VAT increase in 1999.</headline>
<dateline>BERNE, Switzerland 1997-05-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Swiss Cabinet on Thursday recommended a one percent increase in the country's value-added tax in 1999, the finance ministry and Swiss social security office said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>The decision still requires approval of the Swiss parliament, and may also require a public referendum.  </p>
<p>The decision, if approved, would accelerate the introduction of the planned increase. The increase on the tax, now at 6.5 percent, was earlier expected to be phased in via separate half-percentage point increases, with some expecting it would only be increased in the year 2000 and again in 2003.</p>
<p>A finance ministry spokesman said that the latest decision was based on recent calculations showing that the government's &quot;AHV&quot; pension fund would run into financial difficulties unless the tax was increased already by a full percentage point from 1999.</p>
<p>The increase in the VAT would bring an additional 1.5 billion to 2.2 billion Swiss francs into the public pension coffers from 1999 to 2005, the statement said.</p>
<p>It added that the decision is seen as only a stopgap measure.</p>
<p>&quot;The increased revenue would likely not completely cover the demographic-related costs&quot; of AHV, the statement said.</p>
<p>But the proposed increase would &quot;offer the security that the AHV funds would not be used up by the year 2005,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The current 6.5 percent VAT, introduced in January 1, 1995, replaced an older sales tax system.</p>
