<p>September Bund futures traded on LIFFE are likely to see only limited upside on Wednesday as downside pressure builds for a move back towards the 101.00 area, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bunds look as though they should probably continue to weaken,&quot; said Anne Whitby, head of technical analysis at 4CAST in London. &quot;Support is currently at 101.22 which was yesterday's low.&quot;</p>
<p>She said from there Bunds might push a bit higher towards a maximum of 101.64 before heading down again.</p>
<p>At 0655 GMT, September Bund futures were UP 0.02 at 101.34.  </p>
<p>Whitby said 101.64 was the level from which the contract fell sharply on Tuesday. She said there was also an interim level along the way.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got resistance coming in at 101.47 which was a congestion area yesterday, so any early rallies that we do see may get stuck there,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>From there, 101.21 would again come under pressure and once Bunds broke through they would slide to the 101.00 area. That level was just below last week's highs before the contract rallied at the end of the week.  </p>
<p>Richard Adcock, manager of technical research at HSBC Markets in London, said a key day reversal had been completed on Tuesday with the pull back to support at 101.22.</p>
<p>&quot;Overbought stochastics have given a fresh sell signal suggesting further downward pressure can materialise taking the market down to 100.69,&quot; he said in a research note.</p>
<p>&quot;We revert to short positions ahead of the expected weakness, placing stops over 101.62,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>September Euromark futures were unchanged at 96.82.</p>
<p>Adcock said the overall picture remained bullish, but stochastics suggested a correction towards 96.75 short term.</p>
