<p>German wholesale sales edged up in February by a real and seasonally-adjusted 0.1 percent, but were still down by a real 0.6 percent on a year earlier, the Federal Statistics Office said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The modest gain followed a downward revision to January's wholesale sales numbers, which still showed a monthly gain -- again real and seasonally adjusted -- of 1.6 percent. The real rise year-on-year in January was 2.4 percent.</p>
<p>In nominal terms, wholesale sales were unchanged from January to February, but were up 0.9 percent against a year earlier.</p>
<p>A breakdown of the figures showed that there had been strong gains in sales of raw materials, half-finished goods and old materials, which were up seven percent in real terms. Sales of machinery and equipment were also up a real seven percent.</p>
<p>Wholesale sales of food, drinks and tobacco were down seven percent, and consumer goods and durables were down six percent.</p>
<p>For the first two months of this year, wholesale sales were up a real one percent and up two percent in nominal terms.</p>
