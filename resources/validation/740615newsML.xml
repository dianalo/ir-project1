<headline>EPA report not pushing for BOJ policy change -- EPA.</headline>

<p>The Economic Planning Agency's (EPA) annual report released on Friday was not pushing for a change in the Bank of Japan's monetary policy, EPA Vice Minister Shimpei Nukaya told reporters.  </p>
<p>Asked about a section in the EPA's annual report which said that firms, financial institutions and households needed to be aware of the risk that interest rates may rise, he said that speaking in general terms, there was obviously a chance that interest rates may rise one day and it was natural for the EPA to assess the effect of a possible rate rise.  </p>
<p>Nukaya also said that the views of the EPA and the BOJ on the economy were basically the same.</p>
<p>He did acknowledge that some people might interpret slight differences in nuance. He cited, for example, that the BOJ's view could be interpreted as laying more emphasis on the outlook for small firms and non-manufacturers.</p>
<p>He also said the economy was not just being pulled along by a healthy export boom. He said capital expenditures and consumer spending had been making large contributions to the economic recovery since the latter half of the last fiscal year.</p>
