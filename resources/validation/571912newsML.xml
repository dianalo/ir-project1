<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton will venture into the tropical rain forest on Friday to praise Costa Rica's acclaimed conservation efforts and call attention to the global threat of deforestation.</p>
<p>On a visit to the Braulio Carrillo National Park outside the capital, San Jose, Clinton will get a personal view of this nation's well-preserved forests -- a world symbol of the benefits of conservation.</p>
<p>After a Thursday summit meeting with the leaders of six Central American nations and the Dominican Republic, Clinton will tour a misty, exotic woodland in the clouds, teeming with brightly coloured birds and countless species of plants and precious hardwood trees.</p>
<p>Ecotourism is booming here, having replaced coffee as Costa Rica's top export earner. And while the summit revolved mostly around trade and immigration issues, the environment was also a major topic on Clinton's list, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The president will talk about efforts that we are engaged with in this region to work with (Central Americans) on environment ... and will also talk about our global environmental agenda,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurrey told reporters earlier.</p>
<p>The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation has estimated that 38 million acres (15 million hectares) of the world's forests are lost each year, mostly in the Third World.</p>
<p>The problem is particularly acute in other Central American countries, where poor peasants regularly burn tracts of woodland to make room for planting crops or grazing cattle.</p>
<p>Since arriving on Wednesday, Clinton has repeatedly praised conservation efforts in Costa Rica, a country of 3.3 million people that claims to be home to nearly six percent of the world's known plant and animal species.</p>
<p>&quot;The tropical rain forests in our country are genetic libraries for humanity,&quot; Marco Antonio Gonzalez, Costa Rica's vice minister of environment, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Costa Rica's extensive national park system was launched by a former environment minister after he visited Yellowstone National Park in the United States in 1968.</p>
<p>But Costa Ricans say the real boost for environmental management came when former President Oscar Arias won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for engineering a landmark peace agreement for his warring Central American neighbours.</p>
<p>&quot;Costa Rica was put on the world map with the Nobel Peace Prize,&quot; Gonzalez said. &quot;A lot of tourists started to look at Costa Rica.&quot;</p>
<p>Costa Rica is working with foreign companies to develop medicines, cosmetics and food products that come from the rain forest in the kind of plan environmentalists call &quot;sustainable development.&quot;</p>
<p>But environmental protection is far from perfect, according to Alexander Bonillla, Costa Rica's best-known environmental activist.</p>
<p>Vast areas of rain forest were wiped out to create banana plantations, all the rivers near San Jose are polluted with sewage and agricultural runoff, and tighter budgets have meant fewer park rangers to guard the forests, he said.</p>
<p>Gonzalez, the vice minister the environment, said the country is $10 million in arrears on payments promised to land owners who pledged not to exploit privately owned forests.</p>
<p>Poverty here and elsewhere in Central America remains the environment's biggest threat, Bonilla told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't talk about sustainable development with an empty stomach,&quot; Bonilla said.</p>
