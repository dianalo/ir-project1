<p>President Clinton Thursday was preparing a large presentation of new and old Cabinet appointments and working to complete major decisions on his next budget, White House officials said.</p>
<p>At a ceremony planned for Friday, Clinton was expected to nominate new heads of the departments of Transportation, Energy, Labour and Housing and Urban Development and to re-appoint current secretaries for Interior, Agriculture, Education and Veterans Affairs, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're working very hard on it,&quot; Clinton told reporters without tipping his hand.</p>
<p>Aides said Clinton was also likely to name a member of the Federal Reserve Board, Janet Yellen, to replace Joseph Stiglitz as head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Stiglitz is leaving to become chief economist at the World Bank.</p>
<p>Officials said that by late afternoon Clinton had not formally offered Yellen the job, but that they expected him to do so. They said she was the only CEA candidate to actually come to the White House for a job interview.</p>
<p>The CEA, with three members, performs economic analysis for the president.</p>
<p>Adminisration and congressional officials said Clinton was likely to name the head of the Federal Highway Administration, Rodney Slater, as secretary of transportation and an assistant secretary of HUD, Andrew Cuomo, as HUD secretary.</p>
<p>Slater is a long-time Arkansas colleague of the president and was a Clinton confidant and travelling companion during the 1992 presidential campaign. Cuomo, son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, would succeed resigning secretary Henry Cisneros.</p>
<p>Another top prospect for the job, Seattle Mayor Norm Rice, visited the White House this month, but aides said Cuomo had the inside track.</p>
<p>A Kennedy in-law who married one of the daughters of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy, Cuomo was deeply involved in programmes to combat homelessness as assistant HUD secretary.</p>
<p>At the Labour Department, Clinton was believed leaning toward Representative Esteban Torres, a California Democrat, over former Sen. Harris Wofford, Democrat from Pennsylvania, with the prospects of White House aide Alexis Herman apparently fading.</p>
<p>Torres, who would replace popular Labour Secretary Robert Reich, who is resigning, would add another Hispanic face to Clinton's second-term Cabinet.</p>
<p>At Energy, Elizabeth Moler, head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, was seen as the likely choice.</p>
<p>Aides cautioned that Clinton could always change his mind at the last minute.</p>
<p>Current chiefs that Clinton will reappoint include Attorney General Janet Reno, Health and Human Services' Donna Shalala, Interior's Bruce Babbit, Agriculture's Dan Glickman, the Environmental Protection Agency's Carol Browner, Education's Dick Riley and Veterans Affairs' Jesse Brown.</p>
<p>All the newly nominated Cabinet secretaries as well as the CEA head must be confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Clinton was meeting several heads of departments and agencies and his own budget aides to reach by Friday many final decisions for the 1998 fiscal year budget he is to present to Congress on or about Feb. 3.</p>
<p>He was to hear final appeals from the top officials for their spending priorities for key programmes. &quot;He deals with the big picture and makes sure those issues he's most concerned about are addressed the way he wants,&quot; one aide said.</p>
<p>Aides said Clinton was particularly interested in programmes he stressed during his re-election campaign such as education, the environment and fighting crime. He was also looking to pay for targeted tax cuts for education that he proposed on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>Among other key decisions Clinton must decide how much of the $55 billion in spending that would be cut by the welfare law he signed in August should be restored. He had been considering restoring about one-fourth of that amount.</p>
