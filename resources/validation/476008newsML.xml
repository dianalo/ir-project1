<headline>SOCCER-JACQUET WARNS PLAYERS TO THINK OF FRANCE.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-03-31</dateline>

<p>French soccer manager Aime Jacquet has warned his players not to ignore their international obligations as they seek to further their club careers.</p>
<p>Since the Bosman ruling, which allowed players to move freely between clubs, France has lost many of its best soccer talents to wealthy Italian, Spanish and English clubs.</p>
<p>And with France qualified automatically as host of the 1998 World Cup and playing only friendlies, Jacquet is concerned that players' dedication to the national cause might be taking a back seat.</p>
<p>&quot;I handed players a little memo asking them to be very careful about the clubs they would be signing for next season,&quot; said Jacquet at a gathering 40 potential World Cup players near Paris for the Easter weekend.</p>
<p>The manager is worried about players signing lucrative deals with big-name clubs but then not being able to secure a first team place.</p>
<p>&quot;I warned them they should join clubs where they will be playing regularly. I also asked them to take real holidays,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;I told them it was the season they should not miss. Consistency on the pitch will be for me a decisive factor,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;For me, the World Cup has already started. It is an exceptional period and I want players to be exceptional&quot;.</p>
<p>Players underwent medical checks during the weekend and Jacquet said they had shown that many were suffering from muscular and tendon problems.</p>
