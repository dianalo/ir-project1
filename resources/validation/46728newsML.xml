<headline>Monaco's Princess Stephanie seeks divorce-report.</headline>
<dateline>MONACO 1996-09-11</dateline>

<p>Princess Stephanie of Monaco has told her lawyer she plans to divorce her ex-bodyguard husband Daniel Ducruet, French television said on Wednesday after magazine pictures of Ducruet cavorting naked with another woman.</p>
<p>The Italian magazines Eva Tremila and its sister publication Gente last month printed pages of photos of the woman undressing Ducruet, the pair embracing on a sunbed and finally both naked by a poolside in France.</p>
<p>The all-news LCI channel said Stephanie, 31, had contacted her lawyer Thierry Lacoste on Wednesday to inform him that she would seek a divorce.</p>
<p>Lacoste, whose office had said earlier that divorce was a possibility, could not immediately be reached.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Monaco royal family said it had not denied the report but had no comment.</p>
<p>&quot;The princess will very likely move towards divorce proceedings,&quot; Lacoste had told the local newspaper Nice-Matin in remarks published on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But &quot;in a situation like this, in which feelings can change... it is best to remain cautious,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Stephanie's father Prince Rainier had disapproved of his daughter's choice of husband. She had two children with Ducruet before their marriage in July last year.</p>
<p>The Italian magazines said the woman pictured with Ducruet was a 26-year-old Belgian stripper.</p>
<p>The magazines said the photographs were taken in Cap de Villefranche, some 15 km (nine miles) from Monte Carlo. Gente said Ducruet, a keen racing driver, met the singer during a race in Belgium and photographers had been on their trail ever since.</p>
<p>Stephanie, Caroline and Albert are the children of Rainier and former Hollywood screen goddess Grace Kelly, who was killed in a car crash in 1982.</p>
