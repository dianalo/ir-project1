<title>FRANCE: French parliament to debate social security bill.</title>

<p>France's national assembly begins debate later on Tuesday on the centre-right government's bill to curb welfare spending next year through spending controls and revenue measures.</p>
<p>The legislation is expected to win easy passage in the national assembly and the Senate upper house thanks to the coalition government's crushing majority in both houses.</p>
<p>The measure aims to reduce the welfare deficit -- the weak link in efforts to cut France's budget gap -- to 29.7 billion francs in 1997 from 51.6 billion francs this year.</p>
<p>Press reports say the goal now is to cut the deficit to 12.3 billion in 1998 and achieve a surplus of 7.9 billion in 1999.</p>
<p>The government had aimed for a small surplus in the welfare accounts by 1997 to cut public deficits for European monetary union. But slow growth and high unemployment dashed those hopes.</p>
<p>The bill would boost excise duties on alcohol by 1.5 percent, increase duties on tobacco by 3.0 percent and reform payroll charges for health care.</p>
<p>While the bill is expected to get smooth passage, there could be calls for some changes. Alcohol producers are complaining they are unfairly singled out by the revenue-raising plans. And some members of UDF, the junior partner in the centre-right coalition, plan to push for a widening of the revenue base for the welfare system.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the government carried out the second debt write off in just over two years to lift the burden of paying debt service charges from the social security system and set up a new welfare debt repayment fund to take on the debt.</p>
<p>The move was meant to set the system back on its feet. But sluggish growth which has left unemployment at a record high of 12.6 percent wiped out all the gains from those changes and the government pledged higher taxes and new cost curbs.</p>
<p>The social security system -- which uses mostly payroll charges to fund healthcare pensions and family benefits -- is run separately from the central government budget.</p>
<p>Co-managed by the employers' federation and trade unions, it has defied all government attempts to restore it to balance.</p>
<p>However, the latest health spending figures released on Monday by the Caisse Nationale d'Assurances Maladie just ahead of the three-day national debate on the social security bill gave the government some grounds for optimism.</p>
<p>Health spending fell 0.4 percent in September from the previous month and the Caisse said that &quot;the evolution seen over the last four months strongly reduces the risk of overshooting&quot; the government's goal of containing the rise in non-hospital spending to 2.1 percent for the year.</p>
