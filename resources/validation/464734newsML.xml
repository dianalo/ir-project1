<title>VIETNAM: Appeal trial begins in Vietnam's Tamexco scandal.</title>
<headline>Appeal trial begins in Vietnam's Tamexco scandal.</headline>
<dateline>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam 1997-03-24</dateline>

<p>Vietnamese courts began hearing appeals in the nation's biggest graft case on Monday, a process analysts said could uncover new details in a scandal that has shaken Vietnam's political establishment.</p>
<p>Of the 20 people originally sentenced in the Tamexco corruption scandal, four have received the death penalty while most others were handed lengthy prison terms. Fifteen people are appealing their sentences.</p>
<p>State-controlled newspapers in this southern city said 59 people would be summoned to give evidence over the next week or so, including senior local government officials and a vice-governor at the State Bank of Vietnam, the central bank.</p>
<p>The scandal at Tamexco, a Ho Chi Minh City trading firm affiliated with the ruling Communist Party, sent shockwaves through Vietnam's political establishment earlier this year when the case first came to court.</p>
<p>Vietnam's normally timid state media carried lurid details, of the case, in which Tamexco executives and state officials were convicted of looting the company of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Many of the defendants have links to some of the most powerful figures in the country.</p>
<p>Both the state prosecution and defence called during the initial trial for investigators to probe the case further. Analysts said this week's appeals hearings could bring new revelations in the case.</p>
<p>Under Vietnam's judicial system, appeals cases are rarely successful. Defendants facing the death penalty have the final option of seeking a presidential pardon if an appeal fails.</p>
