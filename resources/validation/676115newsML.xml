<p>Russia on Friday pledged to stop targeting Japan with nuclear missiles, in a major step to repair long-strained relations with Tokyo ahead of a three-day day summit of industrialised nations.</p>
<p>A Japanese official said Russian President Boris Yeltsin made the promise during a meeting with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. The official said Japan had agreed to hold regular summit meetings with Russia and establish telephone hotlines.</p>
<p>&quot;The president told the premier that there are former Soviet missles still targeted at Japan, and that time has come to take Japan off the targets,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>At the start of his meeting with Hashimoto, Yeltsin told him, &quot;I am disappointed by the level of relations.&quot;</p>
<p>The two leaders also agreed to a new initiative proposed by Japan to expand Tokyo's investment in Russia.</p>
<p>Removal of Japan from the list of Russian nuclear missile targets would scrap one more symbol of the Cold War era. Japan, however is insistent in its demand for Russia to hand over four north Pacific islands seized by the Red Army at the end of the Second World War, a difficult step for Yeltsin because of strong nationalist opposition in Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;Japan wants to normalise relations with Russia fully,&quot; a Japanese spokesman said, but he added, &quot;It will take some time to conclude this issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin was doing his characteristic best to put his stamp on the summit after missing last year's annual gathering in France because of severe heart problems.</p>
<p>He came to Denver voicing hope Russia would become a fully fledged member of the G7 club of the United States, Japan, France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Canada.</p>
<p>Yeltsin is excluded from only one hour-long economic meeting on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hashimoto said on Thursday he would seek assurances from other G7 leaders that Russia would continue to be excluded from the group's meetings on financial and macro-economic matters.</p>
<p>A Japanese spokesman said on Friday Russia was not yet ready yet to join G7, adding, &quot;It will probably take some time for full integration of Russia into the international financial system.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States has sidestepped the issue by calling this meeting the &quot;Summit of the Eight&quot; but has made no promises to Yeltsin about ultimate inclusion in the exclusive club.</p>
<p>Yeltsin and President Bill Clinton were meeting later on Friday to discuss European security issues, arms control and Russia's integration into the global economy.</p>
<p>That meeting, which will take place several hours before the summit formally opens, is the third between Clinton and Yeltsin this year. The U.S. president was also holding separate talks with French President Jacques Chirac and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi during the day.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said Clinton and Yeltsin would continue an ongoing dialogue on NATO's planned expansion and its new friendly relationship with Moscow.</p>
<p>Underscoring Yeltsin's enhanced role at the Denver summit, U.S. officials said Clinton had arranged for the Russian president to lead off the discussion at the first event of the summit, a working dinner on Friday evening.</p>
<p>The dinner will be at the Phipps Conference Centre, a Georgian mansion set on an estate that once belonged to Colorado philanthropist and onetime senator Lawrence Phipps.</p>
<p>Leaders were bringing some of their own particular issues to Denver, a Rocky Mountain city with snow-capped peaks rising in the distance.</p>
<p>British officials said Prime Minister Tony Blair would seek renewed support from Clinton for ways of advancing the Northern Ireland peace process, set back by the killing of two policemen last week by the Irish Republican Army.</p>
<p>Italian officials said Prodi would tell Clinton of his concern about a Supreme Court decision to uphold the death sentence in Virginia on convicted murderer Joseph O'Dell. The case has become a cause celebre in Italy.</p>
