<p>European stocks climbed on Tuesday, with investors encouraged by a positive close on Wall Street and relieved that Germany's central bank left a key interest rate unchanged.</p>
<p>In currency markets, the dollar jumped a pfennig after the Bundesbank on Tuesday kept its repo rate steady at 3.00 percent although many traders took the view that the threat of rising German rates remained in the market. Sterling was also stronger.</p>
<p>The stronger showing on European bourses followed Monday's  lacklustre start to the week when investors were shaken by a two percent drop in New York on Friday, leading to fears that the recent bull run was was petering out.</p>
<p>Paris, which ended down on Monday, had a volatile morning. Stocks climbed 0.89 percent at the opening on bullish sentiment after the Bundesbank move but lost most of the gains by lunchtime.</p>
<p>French tyre-maker Michelin , which reports first-half sales on Wednesday, was among the best performers. It was 3.2 percent to 369.4 francs by midday, pumped up by Continental's first-half profits increase.</p>
<p>London's early gains were also eroded but stocks were still showing an advance of 0.2 percent at lunch-time, despite stronger-than-forecast inflation figures. Investors were cheered by the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed up 30.89 points at 8062.11 on Monday.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index, which closed only just in the plus column on Monday, was at one stage trading only a few below its all-time peak of 5,086.8 set last Thursday.</p>
<p>The buoyant mood was also helped by big  gains for oil majors British Petroleum, up 16-1/2p to 906p, and Shell, up 7p at 447-1/2p.</p>
<p>&quot;We're being helped by Wall Street and by the oils but the market's short and really was aching to go higher,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, stocks climbed by 0.7 percent, encouraged by Wall Street and the dollar's recent strength, which boosts prospects for exporters.</p>
<p>All eyes in currency markets were on the Bundesbank as traders weighed up the effect of the &quot;no-change&quot; rate move.</p>
<p>The dollar and sterling made an indecisive response, first rising, then falling, then climbing again. By midday, the U.S. currency was up by a pfennig to 1.8640 marks. The British pound was at 2.9575, up a pfennig.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing has changed. The threat that the Bundesbank will send a tightening signal to the market is still there,&quot; said Joe Prendergast, head of global foreign exchange research at CSFB.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bundesbank is keeping the market guessing, but the market is also wary of being too long dollars after Friday's sell-off,&quot; said a UK bank dealer.</p>
<p>Dealers said speculation about what the Bundesbank would do at next week's tender was kept alive because the central bank announced only one fortnightly tender this week.</p>
<p>Tim Fox, chief treasury economist at Standard Chartered, said the expected continuation of a fixed rate was bearish for the mark. Concern voiced recently by the Bank about the weakness of the mark had spurred the market into thinking that the central bank would allow the repo rate to edge higher.</p>
