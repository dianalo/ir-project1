<p>East Timor independence leader Jose Ramos Horta accused Indonesian troops on Tuesday of using gunfire and bayonets to break up a demonstration in a hotel lobby &quot;under the nose&quot; of a U.N. peacemaker.</p>
<p>The 1996 Nobel Peace Prize laureate told reporters 18 young East Timorese were seriously wounded in the weekend clash at a hotel in the island's capital Dili where U.N. special envoy Jamsheed Marker was staying.</p>
<p>He said there were unconfirmed reports of deaths among the protesters, with conflicting count of two to seven killed.</p>
<p>Catholic Church sources in East Timor listed 34 more people as having been injured by bayonets and breaking window glass, while 90 youths were missing and believed to be held by police or the armed forces, Horta said.</p>
<p>Residents and officials in Dili and the International Committee of the Red Cross have said there was no indication of any deaths in the weekend demonstration.</p>
<p>A senior ICRC official said he knew only of 11 people injured in the incident and that none of them had suffered bullet wounds. He said he could not comment on Horta's figures.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, Horta called on the U.N. Human Rights Commission to adopt a &quot;strongly-worded resolution&quot; condemning gross violations in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in 1976.</p>
<p>He said he expected a draft resolution being circulated by the European Union to be adopted next month by the 53-member forum, holding its annual six-week session in Geneva through April 18.</p>
<p>&quot;If any more evidence was needed for a strongly-worded resolution, this incident under the nose of the U.N. special envoy should disperse any doubts,&quot; Horta said.</p>
<p>Horta said that about 250 students had gathered on Sunday outside the Makate hotel where Marker had been staying and that roughly 50 youths had entered the lobby.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a peaceful gathering of these kids in the hotel. The East Timorese youth, students, went to his hotel to deliver a message on the situation on the ground and their political stand which is opposed to the rule of Indonesia.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Once inside (the hotel), they asked to deliver a message and immediately Indonesian army forces and police opened fire inside the hotel lobby on them.</p>
<p>&quot;In the confusion following the firing on them with real bullets -- not rubber bullets -- they tried to escape by breaking the windows of the hotel.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a list of 18 teenagers gravely wounded by bullets. I have an additional list of people fully identified, 34 of them, lightly wounded by bayonets or glass from windows breaking. The Indonesians not only used bullets but bayonets.&quot;</p>
<p>Horta also cited a list of 90 people missing since the incident. &quot;We presume they are in detention at police and army headquarters. In East Timor, detention automatically means being beaten up and tortured.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All this information came from East Timor, Catholic Church sources. What I cannot confirm is how many were killed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some statements we have heard live from Dili... said at least two were killed or maybe four. There are conflicting reports. The figure may be as high as seven,&quot; Horta added.</p>
<p>Police in Dili have said they fired a warning shot with a rubber bullet and one tear gas canister to quell the protest. They have denied firing at protestors.</p>
<p>Marker, speaking to Reuters in Jakarta on Monday at the end of a 48-hour visit to East Timor, said prospects for a settlement between Indonesia and Portugal were encouraging.</p>
<p>Marker said he was in his room at the time of Sunday's demonstration and did not see what had happened. Horta said that Marker had sent an advisor to meet the students in the lobby.</p>
<p>Horta said that following the violence, some students had fled to Motael church, where they sought refuge, and some went to religious orders and residences.</p>
<p>He read from a letter signed by P. Beremau, which he said was the fictitious name of a source in the Catholic Church on the island.</p>
<p>&quot;The message of the priests ends with a question of reflection,&quot; Horta said. &quot;If in the presence of Mr. Marker the Indonesian military people are able to act in such a way that is barbaric and brutal, can you image what happens when U.N. officials are not here in the country?&quot;</p>
