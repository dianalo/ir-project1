<p>Italian state-controlled energy giant ENI supports Libyan membership of the Europe-Mediterranean partnership and opposes sanctions which impede energy development, ENI Chairman Guglielmo Moscato said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Addressing the Offshore Mediterranean Conference, he said the imposition of discriminatory measures on nations which form a vital part of the whole region, especially in the field of energy co-operation, was severely hindering the balanced economic expansion of the area.</p>
<p>&quot;On this matter I feel that we have no choice but to give our support to the position assumed by the Italian government which favours the integration of Libya into the Mediterranean Partnership launched in Barcelona in 1995,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;As regards sanctions, we accept and align ourselves with the decisions of the United Nations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What we cannot approve of, both as Italians and Europeans, is a unilateral system of sanctions that takes the form of impositions and interference of single states in the affairs of our industries and companies that are engaged in their legitimate business activities and investments abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;We are therefore in full agreement with the position of the European Union that contests the application of unilateral secondary boycott sanctions, and has collectively confirmed its objections to the principle of applying sanction which do not originate from appropriate international bodies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>ENI, which has major interests in the Mediterranean basin and North Africa, has often criticised the position of the United States in aiming to penalise countries dealing with nations like Libya and Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;As I see it, the whole Mediterranean area is being offered a unique historic opportunity - the possibility of creating, via joint energy projects, a pacific, synergetic cohesiveness between its diverse countries, some of which have been hostile to each other in the past,&quot; Moscato said.</p>
<p>He noted that energy trade in the Mediterranean area was currently dominated by oil, with annually over 400 million tons of crude oil and oil products transported by ship or pipeline. In contrast, the overall quantities of gas transported by gas tankers and pipelines was less than one tenth that for oil.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many who believe that the massive use of oil and its derivatives will be inevitable for still quite a few years...but natural gas definitely seems to be the highway to the future,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He noted that the lead country for gas projects in the Mediterranean area was Algeria. &quot;This country by the year 2000 will be exporting 60 billion cubic metres of gas per year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But there is another protagonist country that is about to come on stage who shall have decisive effects on the Mediterranean gas trade. I refer to Libya,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said one big step in bringing its resources into play was taken last year with the signing of an accord between NOC and Agip SpA for the joint development of the Wafa Field onshore and of the NC41 offshore field.</p>
<p>He said gas from these two sources will be collected and processed at Sabrata on the northwest coast of Libya.</p>
<p>&quot;From here, by the year 2000, at least eight billion cubic metres of the dry gas should be flowing by pipeline to Italy, while a quota of about two billion cubic metres per year will be retained in Libya to satisfy the internal market in the eastern area of the country,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said that Egypt also had the possibility of becoming not only a major producer and consumer of gas but a major exporter as well.</p>
<p>He noted that overall intra-Mediterranean gas trade should grow from the 30 billion cubic metres of 1990 to 66 billion cubic metres in the year 2000, and then to 86 billion cubic metres in 2010, most of it still moving through pipeline.</p>
