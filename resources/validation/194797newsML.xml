<p>A Lebanese Christian man due to be flogged in the United Arab Emirates for marrying a Moslem woman has converted to Islam and his case has been passed to the UAE's ruler for consideration, the man's lawyer said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Turki Abdu al-Rahman said Elie Dib Ghalib, 30, had been sentenced to 39 lashes and a year in prison in the eastern UAE oasis city of Al-Ain last month by an Islamic court which ruled his marriage was invalid and his marital relationship immoral.</p>
<p>Sources close to the case said Ghalib had been expected to receive the lashings on Saturday, but added he had expressed his intention to convert to Islam and might escape his punishment.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that Mr Elie has become a Moslem, thanks be to God, it's over,&quot; Abdu al-Rahman told Reuters from Al-Ain, 160 km (100 miles) southeast of the capital Abu Dhabi. He did not say when the conversion took place.</p>
<p>&quot;He was not lashed today,&quot; Abdu al-Rahman said.</p>
<p>But he said it was still up to the country's ruler, Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan, to decide what would happen next.</p>
<p>&quot;The case file is with the office of Sheikh Zaid to decide whether or not he will be lashed. Maybe he will say there is no need for the flogging,&quot; Abdu al-Rahman said.</p>
<p>Ghalib's wife Mona, a UAE national studying in the United States, said in a telephone interview she was relieved but confused by the news.</p>
<p>&quot;That's very good news. I'm so happy,&quot; she said. &quot;But what's the reason for still holding him if he's become a Moslem?&quot;</p>
<p>Under Islamic sharia law, a non-Moslem man may not marry a Moslem woman unless he converts to Islam, UAE legal sources said. Such a marriage is deemed null and void. The parties are considered adulterers and may be subject to punishment such as imprisonment or flogging, the sources said.</p>
<p>If the man later converts to Islam, it is up to the legal authorities to decide how to proceed, the sources said.</p>
<p>Amnesty International said on Friday it was deeply concerned by reports of the impending lashing.</p>
<p>&quot;(He) was allegedly beaten and flogged many times during his pre-trial detention and interrogation in Al-Ain police station, apparently in order to force him to sign a confession,&quot; the international human rights group said.</p>
<p>&quot;The organisation is also concerned that he appears to be a prisoner of conscience held on the grounds of his Christian religion and that he has allegedly been tortured,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Ghalib and Mona were married in Lebanon in June 1995 in what she said was a bid to avoid controversy over their mixed-religion marriage.</p>
<p>After the wedding, Mona returned to her studies in the U.S. state of South Carolina. Ghalib went back to his job as restaurant manager at the Intercontinental Hotel in Al-Ain, Amnesty International said.</p>
<p>He was arrested a few months later, Mona said. &quot;The authorities went to his place, turned it upside-down, found the marriage certificate and then went to his office at the Intercontinental. They took him from there,&quot; she said.</p>
