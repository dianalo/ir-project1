<p>British newspapers on Friday hailed Tony Blair's stunning election victory and warned the Labour Party leader he now had to prove himself in office.</p>
<p>The Financial Times, under the headline &quot;Bubbly is uncorked after 18 years on ice&quot;, said the new prime minister now had a strong mandate to rule Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Tony Blair today has the chance to become one of the most powerful prime ministers Britain has had this century.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour's crushing defeat of the Conservatives in yesterday's general election is the strongest imaginable mandate for government.</p>
<p>&quot;If Mr Blair wields it wisely and decisively, he has every chance of going on to win a second term...He has the time, now he has to show us he can use it well,&quot; the FT said.</p>
<p>The Times also acknowledged that the country had thrown itself decisively behind Blair.</p>
<p>&quot;The people have spoken and their message is ringing. Today's sweeping victory for Labour shows more than disillusionment with with a tired and incompetent Tory (Conservative) government.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a comprehensive endorsement of the changes that Tony Blair has made to his party over the past three years,&quot; The Times said.</p>
<p>The Daily Telegraph added: &quot;For the first time in a quarter of a century, the public felt confident enough in Mr Blair to entrust itself once again to Labour.</p>
<p>&quot;If Mr Blair can justify that trust he will make a great contribution to the political life of this country. Now that he has won, we hope that he succeeds.&quot;</p>
<p>The Guardian also greeted a new era in British political life.</p>
<p>&quot;England arose again yesterday and without a change in the heart of England there can never be a change of government...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We greet Labour's election with a congratulation, a cheer, and a surge of hope that it can live up to the expectations which so many millions have placed on it.&quot;</p>
<p>Other papers warned Blair that campaign promises were not the same as the hard business of government.</p>
<p>The Daily Star said: &quot;They face a sobering truth -- they are in the driving seat and they have to make it work.&quot;</p>
<p>The Daily Express added: &quot;They will not be the first to discover that promises made in opposition do not inevitably translate smoothly into government policy.&quot;</p>
<p>The Daily Mirror, perhaps Labpour's most fervent supporter in the British press, said: &quot;Now prove that you're as great as we think you are.&quot;</p>
<p>The Daily Mail, which had backed the Conseravtives, described their defeat at the hands of the Labour Party as &quot;The Mayday Massacre&quot;</p>
