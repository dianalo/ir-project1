<p>The Foundation which owns Italy's largest savings bank, Cariplo, was expected to choose on Monday between rival offers from two Italian banks to form an alliance creating the biggest banking group in the country.</p>
<p>Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) issued a statement on Monday confirming newspaper reports at the weekend that it was interested in linking up with Cariplo -- whose full name is Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde.</p>
<p>The chairman of Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, Giovanni Bazoli, said last month his bank was also keen on a tie-up with the savings bank which is seeking to privatise its ownership.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Cariplo said the chairman of the Cariplo Foundation's 18-member board, Giuseppe Guzzetti, was determined that the Foundation should reach a decision on its fate Monday. &quot;He is very keen to make a choice today,&quot; said the spokesman.</p>
<p>The Foundation's board includes nominees from each of the Lombardy region's 11 provinces and from Milan's city council.</p>
<p>Cariplo's rival suitors represent two different faces of Italian capitalism.</p>
<p>Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) is linked to the powerful Milan merchant bank Mediobanca, through which it has ties with a network of industrial families that making up the backbone of Italian big business.</p>
<p>Its shareholders also include Italy's powerful Assicurazioni Generali insurance group and two forces in international banking, France's Paribas and Germany's Commerzbank.</p>
<p>Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, with its roots in the Northwest of the country, is associated with the thrusting exporters in the dynamic Veneto region but it too has international ties. One of its biggest shareholders is France's Credit Agricole.</p>
<p>Italian newspapers portray Ambroveneto's Bazoli as an exponent of &quot;catholic finance&quot; because of his close ties with the catholic church, in contrast with BCI which is said to belong to the so-called &quot;lay&quot; (non-catholic) camp.</p>
<p>Cariplo's final choice is likely to have less to do with the fine details of each bank's offer than with the personalities involved.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think the winner is going to be decided just on technical grounds,&quot; said an analyst in Milan with a major European investment bank. &quot;It will depend on whoever has the best ties with the management of the (Cariplo) foundation.&quot;</p>
<p>Newspapers reported that Cariplo's management appeared to enjoy closer links with Ambroveneto than with BCI, known univerally in Italy as Comit.</p>
<p>Both Ambroveneto and BCI are reported to have given assurances to Cariplo that the savings bank would maintain a separate identity whichever offer won out.</p>
<p>BCI has proposed the creation of a holding company in which the Cariplo Foundation and a syndicate of BCI's main shareholders would each hold up to 15 percent.</p>
<p>The holding company would exercise control over the two banks which would be run by separate management teams.</p>
<p>Banking analysts said they doubted whether the proposed merger plan would quickly deliver the kind of cost savings that Italy's overmanned banking industry needs.</p>
<p>&quot;If they create a holding company and each of the two banks in the merger survives intact it would be a ridiculous answer to their problems,&quot; said a banker in Milan.</p>
<p>Rome daily La Repubblica said on Monday the sum total of deposits held by Italy's top five banks was equal to those held by German number one Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p>But the German bank ran its operations with far fewer staff. &quot;Deutsche has 74,000 employees whereas the five Italian dwarfs have 124,000,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
