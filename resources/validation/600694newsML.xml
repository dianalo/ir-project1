<p>Most of Asia's stock markets breathed a sigh of relief on Wednesday and rallied in response to the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged, with some markets setting records along the way.</p>
<p>&quot;The rally is mainly due to the interest rate news and sentiment is bullish since there is no bad news so far,&quot; said Antony Mak, sales director at Vickers Ballas in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index surged 1.09 percent in early trading and touched a record 14,391 before retreating slightly. At 0415 GMT it was up 94.16 points, or 0.63 percent, at 14325.31.</p>
<p>The ebullience failed to catch on in Japan, where a strengthening yen prompted heavy selling in stocks of blue-chip exporters.</p>
<p>The key Nikkei-225 share Index opened lower and continued to fall to be off 315.03 points, or 1.55 percent, at 20,017.80.</p>
<p>&quot;The yen has surged very quickly and people want to see when it will stabilise. The cautious stance will cap blue-chip issues for a while,&quot; said a broker at a major securities house.</p>
<p>The policy-setting arm of the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), on Tuesday ended weeks of tortuous debate in world financial markets with its decision to leave the key federal funds rate unchanged at 5.50 percent.</p>
<p>The decision drew some criticism from those analysts who believed the central bankers should have taken a preemptive strike against inflation.</p>
<p>Still, it brought the Dow Jones industrial average out of negative territory and enabled Wall Street to close 74.58 points, or 1.03 percent, higher at 7,303.46.</p>
<p>Asian markets followed, but in many centres the focus soon returned to the highly volatile conditions that have been dominating trading in recent weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;That's one problem out of our system. But we still have to see if we can sustain this rally,&quot; said Poch Zamora, a dealer at Peregrine Securities in the Philippines.</p>
<p>In Manila, stocks snapped out of a four-day losing streak and rallied in light trading aided by the absence of a Fed rate hike and positive economic news. The key index ended up 39.59 points, or 1.58 percent, at 2,538.97.</p>
<p>In Thailand, the government's efforts to prop up the market with a 50 billion baht support fund was beginning to revive investors' interest in the market.</p>
<p>Stocks rallied 2.42 percent in early trade and were up 25.28 points, or 4.38 percent, at 602.38.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are gaining more confidence in the market as they believe the support fund would help the market to a certain level. And (the Fed's) decision...was more good news ,&quot; said Bunsom Kesapradist of Asia Credit.</p>
<p>Indonesian stocks were firmer, although trading remained cautious amid rising tensions in the ongoing general election campaign.</p>
<p>The market was up 1.393 points, or 0.21 percent, at 654.218.</p>
<p>South Korean stocks were hit by fresh rumours of another financial crisis at an established business group, the Haitai Group. The company denied the rumours but the shares of its three listed units plunged, dragging the overall market with them.</p>
<p>The composite index was down 2.14 points at 732.53 after hitting this year's new intra-day high at 739.73.</p>
<p>Taiwan shares staged a mild technical recovery to end 26.14 points, or 0.33 percent, higher at 8,022.89.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the market defied expectations of a government orchestrated rally to celebrate the first anniversary of President Lee Teng-hui's inauguration and lost more than one percent.</p>
<p>Australian stocks set records in early trade but fell victim to profit-taking later in the day. The All Ordinaries Index was up 11.5 points, or 0.46 percent, at 2,542.4 after touching an intra-day high of 2,543.4.</p>
<p>New Zealand stocks added on 0.81 of a point at the close, to end at 2,296.20.</p>
<p>Markets in Singapore and Malaysia were closed for a national holiday.</p>
