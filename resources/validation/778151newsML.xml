<p>Dane Wilson Kipketer took another step towards the world 800 metres title with a typically individual run in the second round on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The defending champion was last at the bell and second to last with 300 metres to run when he accelerated through the field with loping strides to win easily.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't care about any of the other competitors,&quot; he explained afterwards. &quot;I just run my own race.&quot;</p>
<p>The Greek fans were delighted at the second-placed finish of Panayiotis Stroubakos who held off Kennedy Osei of Ghana to take an unexpected place in the last 16.</p>
<p>Olympic champion Vebjoern Rodal of Norway also went through to the semifinals after winning the third heat in 1:46.43, the same time as second placed Patrick Konchellah of Kenya.</p>
<p>The surprise of the round was the elimination of Arthemon Hatungimana of Burundi, silver medalist in the world's two years ago in Gothenburg.    He finished fourth behind Rodal,</p>
<p>Konchellah and Rich Kenah of the United States but failed to qualify as one of the fastest losers.</p>
