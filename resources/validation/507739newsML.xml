<p>NationsBank Corp said productivity improvements and progress in the integration of Boatmen's Bancshares bolstered profit in 1997's first quarter.</p>
<p>Net income rose 38 percent to $709 million and earnings per common share rose 14 percent to $0.97.</p>
<p>NationsBank issued about 98 million shares in the cash and stock Boatmen's transaction which was completed January 7, 1997. NationsBank said in its first-quarter earnings release that it repurchased approximately 41 million shares in the quarter plus an additional 16 million related to employee option plans and coversion of a Boatmen's preferred issue.  </p>
<p>Fully diluted average common shares in the first quarter totaled 752.39 million versus 610.95 million a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;This quarter was marked by continued focus on productivity initiatives and substantial progress on the integration of the former Boatmen's franchise,&quot; chief executive Hugh McColl said in a statement. &quot;Our company is generating substantial cash flows, which enhance our ability to invest in technology, our businesses and future opportunities.&quot;  </p>
<p>Cash-basis earnings, which exclude amortization of intangibles, rose 31 percent to $810 million in the first quarter and cash basis earnings per share rose eight percent to $1.10 per share.</p>
<p>In the Boatmen's transaction, Nationsbank recorded nearly $6.4 billion of intangibles. The intangibles include the &quot;goodwill&quot; reflected in the $9.8 billion purchase.</p>
<p>NationsBank said its non-interest income in the first quarter rose 26 percent to $1.11 billion, reflecting higher levels of income from deposit accounts and asset management and fiduciary service fees.  </p>
<p>Net interest income rose 25 percent to $1.98 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 19 percent increase in average loans and leases and a 40-basis point widening of the net interest yield to 3.83 percent. NationsBank cited improvement in the composition of earning assets.</p>
<p>Total non-performing assets were $1.22 billion on March 31, 1997, or 0.82 percent of net loans, leases and factored receivables and &quot;other real estate owned.&quot; The allowance for credit losses totaled $2.79 billion at the end of the quarter, equal to 265 percent of non-performing loans.  </p>
<p>The provision for credit losses in the first quarter was $190 million, covering net charge-offs of $184 million. Net charge-offs for the quarter equaled 0.50 percent of average net loans, leases and factored receivables, which was unchanged from the year-ago quarter.</p>
