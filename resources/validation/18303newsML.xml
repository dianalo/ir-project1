<headline>Graboplast extends gain on weaker Budapest.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1996-08-28</dateline>

<p>Hungarian share prices closed lower on the Budapest Stock Exchange as reflected by the BUX index, but the market, lacking fresh incentive, remained trendless, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading was going calmly without anything special,&quot; said Laszlo Lakatos of Bank Austria-GiroCredit Befektetesi Rt. &quot;The appearance of one or two major buyers or sellers is enough to move prices to either sides,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The BUX index ended at 3,339.32 points, down 20.22. BUX futures closed lower for all maturities. Spot share turnover totalled 607.3 million forints.</p>
<p>Oil company MOL weakened 10 forints to end at 1,540, on what traders explained by uncertainties on energy price increase delays.</p>
<p>The Hungarian government announced last week that it postponed the energy price increase until January 1, 1997 from October 1, 1996.</p>
<p>Home improvement product maker Graboplast firmed to close at 3,975 forints, up 115, on what traders explained with the complete lack of supply.</p>
<p>Brewery Martfu firmed almost 10 percent or 175 forints to end at 2,000 forints in only two deals.</p>
<p>Chemical company TVK put on five forints to end at 1,340 forints, but traders doubted the paper could move away from its recent narrow price range due to strong supply.</p>
<p>&quot;The share seems unable to move out of the recent price range, despite the fact it is cheap,&quot; Lakatos said. Traders blamed the strong supply, mainly from abroad.</p>
