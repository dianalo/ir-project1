<p>Militia loyal to the Congo Republic's former Marxist military leader advanced on Brazzaville international airport on Sunday and bombarded troops loyal to President Pascal Lissouba there with tank and mortar bombs.</p>
<p>The barrage, which began with mortar fire at 2 a.m. and continued into mid-morning, followed two days of relative calm in the capital of the former French colony and diplomatic efforts to end over a week of ethnic and political killing.</p>
<p>But at least one mediator played down the significance of the exchanges.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a small incident. These things happen during negotiations when sides try to improve their positions,&quot; French Ambassador Raymond Cesaire told reporters. &quot;There will be more incidents like this while there are still men carrying arms.&quot;</p>
<p>The conflict started on June 5 after the army surrounded Sassou Nguesso's home as part of a crackdown on private militias and unauthorised arms in the runup to a July 27 election in the oil-producing Central African nation.</p>
<p>Former president Denis Sassou Nguesso's Cobra militia moved two T-55 tanks towards an airbase held by Lissouba loyalists on Sunday and appeared to advance towards the main building in the nearby airport, French and other Western military sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not really conquered ground because it was not occupied before but it clearly shows their intention to advance,&quot; one source said of the Cobras' tank movements.</p>
<p>Envoys representing Lissouba and Sassou Nguesso agreed on Saturday to meet in Gabon for talks on implementing a peace deal -- with deployment of an African force being touted as one solution.</p>
<p>Confusion surrounded the timing of the talks. Brazzaville mayor and mediator Bernard Kolelas said the envoys would meet on Sunday. U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun and sources in Gabon's capital said the talks would most likely be on Monday.</p>
<p>Charles Matoko, Kolelas's director of protocol, said the Libreville meeting had to go ahead. &quot;Even if there's fighting at the airport a solution must be found,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Maurice Mavoungo, Lissouba's director of protocol, accused Sassou Nguesso of flouting the peace process and said the presidency had a delegation ready to leave for Libreville.</p>
<p>&quot;They must negotiate,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;They are stupid if they think they can continue with their coup d'etat. The people are tired and what they want now is peace and negotiations.&quot;</p>
<p>Bodies litter Brazzaville's streets and the smell of rotting corpses permeates parts of the city. Some sources say the death toll could run into hundreds and maybe even several thousand but many of the dead lay uncollected where they fell.</p>
<p>The two sides declared a truce on Wednesday and it seemed to take hold in most parts of the city on Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>France, which has evacuated almost 5,000 foreign nationals, about a third of them French, said it would wind up its rescue mission later on Sunday and start pulling out.</p>
<p>Kolelas aides and Lissouba have floated the idea of French troops staying. Sassou Nguesso is cooler on the idea. Both Lissouba and Sassou Nguesso say they want the poll to go ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;We must do everything to ensure that the elections are held within the delays foreseen in the constitution,&quot; Sahnoun said on Saturday after talks with all sides. &quot;Democracy must definitely be put back on track.&quot; Lissouba's mandate ends on August 31.</p>
