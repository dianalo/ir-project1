<p>Italian state telecommunications giant Stet is aiming to forge an alliance with U.S. telecoms giant AT&amp;T Corp by the end of the year, Stet managing director Tomaso Tommasi di Vignano said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tommasi, talking to reporters at a meeting of Italian employers here, said Stet was working intensively on reaching an accord with AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>He gave no details, but asked when such an accord with the U.S. group might happen, he said: &quot;The objective is to have an accord on an international alliance by the year end.&quot;</p>
<p>Stet has been seeking a big international partner for months to turn it into a major player on the increasingly competitive world telecoms stage.</p>
<p>It has a limited cooperation deal with U.S. computer giant IBM and linked up earlier this year with AT&amp;T to bid for the privatisation of Brazil's cellular phones.</p>
<p>Italian media have speculated the original AT&amp;T partnership might lead to a bigger agreement although up until now both companies have offered no comment.</p>
<p>The Italian group, which has a strong presence in south America, is looking to expand further and is bidding with Spain's Endesa for the privatisation of the country's Retevision as well as taking a 29 percent stake in Serbia Telekom.</p>
<p>The Rome government is keen to get a major international partnership in place before it privatises Stet, a move which is now expected to take place next October after many delays.</p>
<p>Tommasi said he expected a decree covering the Stet sell-off to be presented to the cabinet in the next few days and said the placement was due to take place in October.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the course that's been stated. That's what we're working for...I am confident and I am also willing to do all that it requires,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Stet's sale has been repeatedly postponed mostly because of the government's difficulty in pushing legislation through parliament to set up a watchdog to regulate the telecoms sector.</p>
<p>After months of haggling, the authority bill is now ready for a final reading in the lower house of parliament after being approved by the upper house of parliament (Senate) last month.</p>
<p>As part of the privatisation plan, Stet is also being merged with state-controlled telephone operator Telecom Italia . The fusion is due to become operational in mid-July with the resulting company taking the Telecom Italia name.</p>
