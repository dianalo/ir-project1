<p>Grad &amp; Walker Energy Corp, whose stock was halted on Monday pending news, would not comment before Toronto Stock Exchange trading resumes on Wednesday, a company spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The Calgary-based oil company's shares climbed 1.45 to 11.15 before Monday's trading halt midway through the session. Its shares have risen from 9.15 on June 25.</p>
<p>Canadian markets are closed on Tuesday because of the Canada Day holiday.</p>
<p>Grad &amp; Walker's main operating areas include the Marengo and Mantario East oil plays in southwestern Saskatchewan and Three Hills Creek in central Alberta.</p>
<p>Barry Jackson, chief executive of Crestar Energy Inc, which operates in areas close to Grad &amp; Walker's, said Crestar was not in a deal with the company.</p>
<p>Crestar's shares also made a big gain on Monday, climbing 1.25 to 25.10.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the company bought Grad &amp; Walker's southwestern Saskatchewan Mantario oil pool for C$46 million.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not have a deal with Grad &amp; Walker,&quot; Jackson said, adding that he fielded several telephone calls on Monday inquiring about the possibility of a takeover.</p>
<p>Another firm rumored to be in a deal with Grad &amp; Walker was Tri Link Resources, although the company does not currently operate in the southwestern Saskatchewan area, analysts said.</p>
<p>Tri Link Chairman Gary Burns was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Tri Link shares were closed unchanged on Monday at 25.75.</p>
<p>Other firms with southwestern Saskatchewan operations near Grad &amp; Walker's include Rigel Energy Corp, Pinnacle Resources Ltd and Stampeder Exploration Ltd. ((Reuters Calgary Bureau (403) 531-1624))</p>
