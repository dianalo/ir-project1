<title>MALAYSIA: Telekom stock weak on Ericsson worries.</title>
<headline>Telekom stock weak on Ericsson worries.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-01-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Malaysian utility Telekom Malaysia Bhd stock was trading weaker on negative sentiments over an investigation by the government into a contract given to Sweden's Ericsson, analysts said.</p>
<p>The announcement of Telekom's involvement in the building of world's longest cable network failed to buoy investor confidence in the company, in light of the investigation.</p>
<p>At 0800 GMT the stock was down 40 cents to 20.60 ringgit.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not good news for Telekom, even though it really has no immediate impact on the company's earnings,&quot; said Phuah Lee Kerk, telecommunications analyst at Vickers Ballas.  </p>
<p>Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on Wednesday he had received a report that there may have been &quot;discrepancies&quot; in a contract awarded by Telekom to Sweden's LM Ericsson.</p>
<p>Some analysts did not directly attribute Telekom's fall to the Ericsson news, noting the stock as well as other blue chips have been weak in recent sessions.</p>
<p>&quot;People are switching to (power firm) Tenaga because things are improving. For Telekom, it can only get worse due to industry competition,&quot; said Soon Teck Onn, telecommunications analyst at ING-Barings in Kuala Lumpur.  </p>
<p>&quot;Investors will take the news as a negative factor and use it as an excuse to sell Telekom stock,&quot; said Phuah.</p>
<p>Telekom Malaysia will contribute $50 million, towards a consortium of companies building a 38,000 km (23,600 mile) cable network stretching from the South Pacific to the North Atlantic, across Asia and the Middle East. The company's involvement in the project was announced in Singapore on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not much positive sentiment over the cable deal, as it's very long term. Telekom will probably not see any profits from the deal for at least another three to four years,&quot; said Phuah.  </p>
<p>Haizan Khir Johari, telecoms analyst at Schroder Research said another significant contributor to the fall in Telekom's share price was a &quot;big sell recommendation placed on the stock by a major American stock broking house&quot;.</p>
<p>He said the main reason for the recommendation was the advent of equal access to Malaysia's lucrative fixed line network for several other telecommunication service providers in the country. The equal access agreements come into effect in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;Telekom will lose some market share, but it will retain its resilient character as an incumbent telecoms operator,&quot; said Haizan.</p>
