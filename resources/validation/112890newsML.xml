<p>U.S. Ryder Cup captain Tom Kite played a masterly shot at the final hole to win the Oki Pro-Am European Tour event on Sunday.</p>
<p>Kite, 46, came to the 18th level with Argentine Angel Cabrera but then struck a 110-yard sand wedge just 18 inches from the pin and rolled in the putt for a winning birdie three.</p>
<p>It gave him a round of 70 for a 72-hole aggregate of 273, 15 under par. Cabrera, the overnight leader, shot 72 for 274.</p>
<p>European Ryder Cup captain Seve Ballesteros was third, equalling the best round of the day with 69 for 276.</p>
<p>Cabrera, who shot a course record 62 on Saturday, was one shot ahead of Kite with two holes to play and had victory in his grasp. But he three-putted the short 17th to allow the American to draw level and then came Kite's superb finish.</p>
<p>Even then Cabrera might have forced a play-off. He had a six-foot putt for a birdie at the 18th but the ball rolled past the edge of the hole.</p>
<p>Kite was delighted with his victory, saying: &quot;I hadn't won for such a long time that I was beginning to wonder whether I would ever win again.</p>
<p>&quot;I know there were a lot of good guys playing in the Dunhill Cup this week but here in Madrid we had a quality field.&quot;</p>
<p>Ballesteros, last but one out, played a quality round in strong wind and driving rain. He had five birdies in his first 12 holes and managed a par five at the 11th after going into the water.</p>
<p>&quot;That penalty shot at the 11th proved the turning point,&quot; he said. &quot;I began today five shots behind the leader and when I went out in 33 to close to one shot I thought I would win. But it was not to be.&quot;</p>
