<p>Sunbeam Corp. said on Wednesday that its health care products carrying new consumer information from the American Medical Association will be on the market in a few weeks.</p>
<p>The agreement between the largest U.S. medical group and Sunbeam will package health care literature with products ranging from blood pressure monitors to thermometers.</p>
<p>The first products carrying the information will hit store shelves this fall, said Kathy Bushkin, a spokeswoman for the company, with a complete roll-out later in the year.</p>
<p>&quot;This agreement with the American Medical Association will help consumers choose and use our products,&quot; said Al Dunlap, chairman and CEO of Sunbeam in making the announcement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Every time consumers see the AMA's name on Sunbeam's 'HealthHome' products, they'll know they've been recommended for healthier living by the AMA. And consumers will also benefit from the AMA's educational material which will be packaged with our products,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Sunbeam products involved are heating pads, blood pressure monitors, thermometers, air cleaners, vaporizers, humidifiers, scales, hot-cold therapy and massagers.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, getting the best out of our medical system means being an active participant in your own health care,&quot; said AMA executive Vice President P. John Seward. &quot;And in order for consumers to be effective in their new and more demanding role, they need to be guided by good, accurate, updated information.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the arrangement, affected Sunbeam products will carry an AMA tag to alert consumers that they contain educational materials produced by the AMA. The same information will also be available at the point of purchase.</p>
<p>The AMA and Sunbeam said they would also create a physicians advisory panel to assist in the development of future health care products and they would join retailers in sponsoring consumers education events such as blood pressure screenings.</p>
<p>The company said all fees it will pay to the AMA under the arrangement will be used by the medical group for its public health education campaigns.</p>
