<p>Nigerian Petroleum Minister Dan Etete said it would take more than $1 billion to keep oil refineries running at levels that would prevent fuel shortages, local newspapers reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The newspapers quoted Etete as saying $859 million plus 13 billion naira spread over a period of 18 months would be needed to keep refineries running at 85 percent of their installed capacity of 445,000 barrels per day (bpd).</p>
<p>&quot;For efficient performance, maintenance must be timely. They (the refineries) need to be revamped in order to remain operational,&quot; Etete said,</p>
<p>He repeated an earlier complaint that the $230 million budgeted for refineries in 1997 was not paid and he complained about the crude oil allocation to refineries of 250,000 bpd, which he said was too low.</p>
<p>Nigeria, despite being a major crude oil producer, suffers frequent periods of fuel shortage and has had to import fuel to meet domestic demand because the four ailing refineries are unable to cope.</p>
<p>Etete suggested that the refineries' margins from the sale of petroleum products could be increased to 5.67 naira per litre from the current 2.00 naira per litre.</p>
