<p>Millfeed prices were mixed on Wednesday as many dealers kept a close watch on declining CBOT corn prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Business has died,&quot; one dealer said. He said many buyers were on the sidelines waiting for lower millfeed prices. &quot;There appears to be an easiness, mainly because of the grain markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A Tennessee dealer agreed, noting that the nearby positions were soft with pressure from the CBOT board.</p>
<p>A Missouri broker said demand has also slackened for millfeed pellets for catfish.  </p>
<p>&quot;The cool weather has slowed down their metabolism and catfish (in Mississippi ponds) do not eat as much,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one Minnesota dealer said nearby supplies remained very tight.</p>
<p>&quot;People call me everyday for immediate shipments,&quot; he said. &quot;Supplies are not adequate.&quot;</p>
<p>He said some areas are out of old crop corn and have not started harvesting.</p>
