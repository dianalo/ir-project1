<title>BULGARIA: Bulgaria lev falls further on interest rate cut.</title>
<headline>Bulgaria lev falls further on interest rate cut.</headline>
<dateline>SOFIA 1997-05-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Bulgarian lev fell further to around 1,550-1,553 per dollar around 1030 local time (0730 GMT) from the opening's 1,543-1,545 due to shortcovering triggered by a cut in the main interest rate, dealers said.</p>
<p>The lev closed at 1,534-1,536 at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign currency demand is running high due to a massive shortcovering but supply is very low,&quot; a bank dealer said.</p>
<p>A rise in free lev liquidity in banks was also a reason for the lev fall.  </p>
<p>Banks had an ample lev liquidity on Friday after the Finance ministry rejected 77 billion lev worth of bids for short-term government securities in the past two days, central bank figures showed.</p>
<p>&quot;Those free levs are now channelled to the forex market, seeking a vent,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) on Thursday said it would cut its main interest rate to 4.29 percent monthly from 5.20 percent, effective from Monday.  </p>
<p>The cut would further pare yields on lev-denominated, floating interest government securities, which have attracted foreign investors since March. The main interest rate stood at 18 percent monthly in March and has steadily fallen since then.</p>
<p>Those investors were a major source of foreign currency supply in the past two months but now most of them were not offering dollars for levs, dealers said.</p>
<p>Interest on local floating interest T-bills is pegged to the main interest rate and falls with each rate cut during the period to maturity of the paper. -- Sofia Newsroom, (++359-2) 911 88  (c) Reuters Limited 1997</p>
