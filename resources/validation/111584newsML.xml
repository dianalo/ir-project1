<p>President Bill Clinton proposed on Thursday a $100 million plan to expand the speed and scope of the Internet to help make computers in school classrooms as important as blackboards.</p>
<p>At rallies in Louisville, Dayton, Ohio, and Knoxville, Tenn., Clinton portrayed himself as a man looking ahead to the future and his Republican opponents, Bob Dole and running mate Jack Kemp, as wedded to the past.</p>
<p>Clinton announced details of his Internet proposal in Knoxville, an area dependent on government-funded science research. He said he wanted to see the day &quot;when computers are as much a part of classrooms as blackboards.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let us reach for a goal in the 21st century of every home connected to the Internet and let us be brought closer together as a community through that connection,&quot; Clinton told Democratic supporters in Tennessee, Vice President Al Gore's home state.</p>
<p>Clinton announced a three-pronged strategy to make Internet access universal.</p>
<p>-- He urged the Federal Communications Commission to approve at a Nov. 8 meeting a proposal that schools and libraries be given basic Internet services free. Telecommunications companies would pay for this by putting money into a fund, much as they currently subsidize poor and rural phone users.</p>
<p>-- He said industry leaders would help raise money to match government technology-literacy grants to buy computers for schools and ensure that teachers are properly trained.</p>
<p>-- And he said the $100 million Internet upgrade project would help develop a new generation of the information superhighway that would be 100 to 1,000 times faster than the existing computer system, which is rapidly reaching capacity.</p>
<p>&quot;Like any other piece of critical infrastructure, it has to be repaired and upgraded to meet all of our education, medical and national security needs. It is now time to invest in the next generation of Internet,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Clinton's campaign seized on remarks by Kemp to suggest that Dole should not make &quot;character&quot; questions about Clinton an issue at their second and last debate on Oct. 16.</p>
<p>In his debate on Wednesday night against Vice President Al Gore, Kemp said, &quot;It is beneath Bob Dole to go after anyone personally.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart said &quot;anytime (Dole) has gone negative, he's hurt himself. In this (election) cycle negative politics isn't working. We have to believe that Kemp was speaking for the ticket last night.&quot;</p>
<p>In Louisville, Clinton made an indirect reference to the possibility of a character attack from Dole at a downtown rally in front of the Louisville Slugger Museum honoring the wooden baseball bats used across the country for decades.</p>
<p>Brandishing a bat given him, Clinton said: &quot;Thank you for this Louisville Slugger. You know, I've got one more debate and from what I've heard I may need this.&quot;</p>
<p>Enjoying a big lead in the polls ahead of the Nov. 5 election, Clinton said the debates so far had offered two different visions for America and described Dole and Kemp as &quot;two good people on the other side who love our country but just see things differently than we do.&quot;</p>
<p>Baseball metaphors were flying at random at the rally attended by a large noisy crowd on a cool drizzly evening. &quot;The president used his veto pen like Babe Ruth used to use his Louisville Slugger,&quot; said Kentucky Democratic Rep. Mike Ward, speaking of Clinton's vetoes of Republican legislation.</p>
<p>To try to fend off charges from Dole and Kemp that Clinton is weak on foreign policy, the Clinton campaign said more than 100 national security experts had endorsed Clinton.</p>
<p>It named 13 of them, most of whom served Democratic presidents although one, former arms control negotiator Paul Nitze, served in administrations spanning both parties. Jack Matlock was ambassador to the Soviet Union under Republican President George Bush.</p>
<p>&quot;We praise the president's willingness to use U.S. military power effectively, as he has done in Iraq, Bosnia, Haiti, the Taiwan Strait and elsewhere,&quot; they said.</p>
