<p>Indian stocks extended their 4-day winning streak on Friday, with sentiment undermined by the resignation of former premier P.V. Narasimha Rao as chief of the Congress party and some fund buying, traders said.</p>
<p>The market has rallied in five trading sessions, taking the week's winning tally to about eight percent.</p>
<p>Local funds were buyers in stocks such as ITC and BSES. Short-covering on the last day of trade settlement at the Bombay bourse also helped the rise in blue-chips, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are hopeful of possible positive political development,&quot; said a dealer at a local brokerage.</p>
<p>Bowing to pressure from senior leaders, Rao steeped down from the post of chief of Congress party's parliamentary team on Thursday amid a flurry of corruption charges.</p>
<p>Analysts believe Rao's exit could pave the way for the Congress to rebuild itself. The former premier has been charged in three separate corruption cases. He denies any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a morale booster for the market...I see some sort of long-term political stability coming up,&quot; said investment analyst Homiyar Vasania at Parag Parikh Financial Services.</p>
<p>The ruling 13-party coalition government depends on Congress for crucial support.</p>
<p>A new leader will be elected to replace Rao on Monday, Congress party officials said.</p>
<p>Most Indian bourses are open for only two days next week before closing for the Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>The Delhi share index gained 8.73 points to 678.80 boosted by buying by local and foreign funds, brokers said.</p>
<p>TISCO rose 3.25 rupees to 164.25, SBI 2.0 to 223.50, Bajaj Auto 24.0 to 840.0, Reliance 4.75 to 202.25, Hind Lever 7.50 to 814.0, ACC 18.0 to 1,170.0, ITC 10.20 to 295.25, BSES 13.20 to 208.0 and L&amp;T 9.0 to 221.75. REUTER</p>
