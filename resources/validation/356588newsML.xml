<p>After years of preparation, Canada's costly Hibernia oil project faces a new challenge as it nears production -- proving Newfoundland's oil industry can compete with the world's top basins.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very important to get the platform out there and get it operating at top productivity as an indication to the rest of the world that Newfoundland is a good place to do business,&quot; said Harvey Smith, president of Hibernia Management and Development Co. Ltd., the project's operating company.</p>
<p>The C$6.2 billion ($4.6 billion) Hibernia project is scheduled to start pumping oil in December.</p>
<p>Its platform is expected to pump an average of 135,000 barrels a day from beneath the harsh waters of Newfoundland's Grand Banks on Canada's east coast. It will be Canada's first major offshore producing venture.</p>
<p>Smith, who was vice-president of exploration operations at Mobil Corp. before signing on with HMDC in October, said in an interview that Hibernia laid the groundwork for the world's oil heavyweights to proceed with plans to develop other offshore fields in the region.</p>
<p>Companies such as Mobil, Amoco Corp. and Petro-Canada now place Canada's east coast among their top worldwide operating regions, and billions of dollars in spending are planned over the next decade.</p>
<p>Smith said that crude oil transport systems, terminals, warehouses and construction sites built for Hibernia -- plus new local expertise and service businesses -- would help Newfoundland to compete on costs with the North Sea and U.S. Gulf Coast. He said a favorable royalty system announced last year would also play a big role.</p>
<p>&quot;The logistics part of it is not competitive today with what's going on in the North Sea,&quot; said Smith. &quot;But as other companies like Amoco and Petro-Canada start to develop out there, we think we can use this infrastructure, share it, get our costs down and also get the costs down for anyone else.&quot;</p>
<p>Hibernia is set for several milestones in 1997, 18 years after its first discovery well was drilled.</p>
<p>In March, the platform's topsides production facility, which includes drilling and producing equipment and living quarters, was set to be &quot;mated&quot; to the concrete gravity base structure (GBS).</p>
<p>The GBS is a 111-metre (364- foot) high concrete and steel base, designed to withstand the icebergs that drift perilously off Canada's east coast.</p>
<p>The whole complex will be towed 135 km (84 miles) into the Atlantic, likely in June, to set up for the first production.</p>
<p>Hibernia, once viewed as an expensive government boondoggle and a holdover from the megaproject-happy 1970s, has had a rocky road.</p>
<p>Cost overruns plagued the Newfoundland building site in the early 1990s and the project almost died when Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. pulled out in 1992, a year and a half into construction.</p>
<p>The completion schedule was pushed pack several months as a search for new partners was mounted, eventually resulting in the the signing up of the Canadian government and Murphy Oil Corp..</p>
<p>Current partners are Petro-Canada with 20 percent, Mobil Oil Canada with 33.125 percent, Chevron Corp. unit Chevron Canada Resources Ltd. with 26.875 percent, Murphy with 6.5 percent, Canada with 8.5 percent and Norway's Norsk Hydro A/S with five percent.</p>
<p>Smith said Hibernia, which has booked reserves of 615 million barrels, was expected to break even at an oil price of $12.90 a barrel over its 18-year life. Its average operating costs were projected at $4.15 a barrel.</p>
