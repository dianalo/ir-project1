<p>The Clinton administration plans to introduce legislation soon that would clearly affirm that encryption users in this country are free to use any type or strength of encryption technology, a senior administration official said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Currently, no such explicit law is on the books.</p>
<p>Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch also told a Senate Commerce Committee hearing the bill would explicitly state that participation in so-called &quot;key management infrastructure&quot; would be voluntary. Key refers to the password or software &quot;key&quot; that can read encrypted information.</p>
<p>The bill also would:</p>
<p>-- Spell out the legal conditions for the release of &quot;recovery information&quot; to law enforcement officials. The bill also provides legal safeguards for third-party &quot;key recovery agents&quot; who have properly released such information.</p>
<p>-- Criminalizes the misuse of keys and the use of encryption to further a crime.</p>
<p>-- Offers, on a voluntary basis, firms that are in the business of providing public cryptography keys the opportunity to obtain government recognition. Such recognition, Reinsch said, would allow firms to &quot;market the trustworthiness implied by government approval.</p>
<p>The testimony came in a hearing on two bills introduced by Senate lawmakers that would remove almost all export curbs on encryption technology.</p>
<p>The administration's newest export policy, enacted through executive order in November and in effect since January 1, allows export of stronger encryption than previously allowed.</p>
<p>But it requires companies to incorporate features within two years allowing the government to crack the codes by getting access to the software keys.</p>
<p>Administration officials said they opposed the export provisions in the two Senate bills, saying that the export liberalization goes too far.</p>
<p>The bills were offered by Sens Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Conrad Burns (R-Montana).</p>
