<p>Japan's trade surplus for September will continue to show a year-on-year decline on the back of strong growth in imports coupled with a rise in global oil prices, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll of analysts showed Japan's customs-cleared trade surplus is projected to be between 720 billion and 906 billion yen in September after a surplus of 1.12 trillion yen a year earlier. The September figures are due to be released at 8.50 a.m. on Friday (2350 GMT on Thursday).</p>
<p>Such a figure would mean Japan's trade surplus would have fallen year on year for the 22nd straight month.  </p>
<p>Imports of electronic parts and communications and office equipment will continue to show strong growth, analysts said.</p>
<p>Higher global oil prices are another factor pushing up the value of imports, they said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Japan's exports are rebounding, helped by a rise in shipments of cars. Some attributed this trend mainly to the weaker yen, which helps Japanese cars regain global price competitiveness, while others said it was because consumer demand was sluggish at home.  </p>
<p>&quot;Although the trade surplus is still on a shrinking trend in the longer term...the pace of the fall may slow down a bit,&quot; said Kyohei Morita at Nomura Research Institute. Economists' forecasts for the September trade surplus are as follows:</p>
<p>    YAMAICHI RESEARCH INSTITUTE     790   billion yen</p>
<p>    NIKKO RESEARCH CENTER	     830   billion yen</p>
<p>    BZW				     900   billion yen</p>
<p>    DAIWA BANK RESEARCH INSTITUTE   725.2 billion yen</p>
<p>    IBJ				     720   billion yen</p>
<p>    SAKURA BANK			   815   billion yen</p>
<p>    NOMURA RESEARCH INSTITUTE	 906   billion yen</p>
