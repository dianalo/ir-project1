<headline>NWE oil products all unchanged, buying thin.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-06-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE oil products continued to hold to Tuesday's closing levels, with only faint buying interest, dealers said.</p>
<p>Eurograde gasoline traded once at $187 fob AR. The deal was another transfer of material fob AR between two trading houses which have repeatedly featured in morning barge business this week. Another barge traded later at $186 fob ARA. Rotterdam offers were at around $189/$190 fob.</p>
<p>Heating oil barges were unchanged as IPE gas oil futures were flat and premiums were unaltered. Prompt deliveries were still offered at IPE June +75 cents. Bids were at +50 cents or lower.</p>
<p>High sulphur fuel oil was likewise unchanged. One barge of RMG traded at $86.25 fob Rotterdam. Late morning talk was at $86/$86.50, little change from Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>Bunker demand appeared low for the third consecutive day.</p>
