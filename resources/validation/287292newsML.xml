<p>Half-centuries from Andrew Hudson, Daryll Cullinan and Brian McMillan put South Africa into an almost impregnable position in the second test against India at Newlands on Sunday.</p>
<p>At tea on the fourth day they had reached 246 for six in their second innings, an overall lead of 416.</p>
<p>After the early loss of nightwatchman Lance Klusener for 12 which reduced them to 33 for three, South Africa recovered well through two good partnerships.</p>
<p>First, Hudson and Cullinan, who both made 55, added 94 for the fourth wicket before Cullinan played inside a leg-break from Anil Kumble and was bowled.</p>
<p>India then collected two more wickets as Hudson played on to Javagal Srinath and captain Hansie Cronje became Kumble's second victim when he was caught at short-leg by Rahul Dravid for 18.</p>
<p>At 155 for six, South Africa were again in a degree of trouble but an unbroken partnership of 91 between McMillan and Shaun Pollock re-established their command.</p>
<p>McMillan was 58 not out at the interval while Pollock had 33.</p>
<p>With the declaration imminent it left India facing the likely task of having to bat for the best part of four sessions to avoid going 2-0 in the three test series.</p>
<p>South Africa won the first test in Durban by 328 runs.</p>
