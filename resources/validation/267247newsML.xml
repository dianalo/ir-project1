<p>ITT Hartford, whose name had caused confusion since its spinoff from ITT Corp. last year, said Thursday it was changing its name to &quot;The Hartford&quot; on the anniversary of its listing as an independent company.</p>
<p>The change is to become effective immediately as the company's brand name, but shareholders will be asked to vote on the firm's legal name in May of next year.  </p>
<p>&quot;During this first year, we have firmly established ourselves as a dynamic, international financial services company,&quot; Donald Frahm, The Hartford's chairman and chief executive said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company's stock price has risen by 35 percent since it ended its 25-year marriage to ITT Corp. on December 20 of last year, Frahm said.</p>
<p>The 186-year-old company has also realigned itself into five core businesses to position itself for growth, he added.  </p>
<p>The nation's third-oldest insurer said that its research this year showed that the market and consumers were confused about who owned the company.</p>
<p>&quot;The Hartford and the stag have a strong brand identity,&quot; said Connie Gurney, spokeswoman for The Hartford.</p>
<p>&quot;We're already widely known as The Hartford, and we're trying to capitalize on it and strengthen the brand.&quot;</p>
<p>As part of the image makeover, the company will launch a $10-12 million ad campaign created by Boston agency Arnold Communications early next year, said Gurney.  </p>
<p>The name change will not affect foreign subsidiaries of The Hartford.</p>
<p>The Hartford is the nation's seventh-biggest property-casualty insurer and eight-biggest life insurance group. It had assets of $104 billion as of end September.</p>
