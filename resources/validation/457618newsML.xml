<p>The current weakness in the crown need not be dramatic but neither is it a laughing matter, the Riksbank said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Riksbank deputy governor Lars Heikensten said a reason for the weakness was uncertainty about political economics in the longer term.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the crown weakening is dramatic but nor is it a laughing matter,&quot; Heikensten told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a rather strong weakening that has occurred over a long period.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a number of explanations for this. One is that there is some uncertainty about political economics, mainly in the outlook for the next five to ten years.&quot;</p>
<p>Heikensten said other issues that have weakened the crown were Sweden's position on Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU), a commission about how foreign exchange policy will be driven in the future and uncertainty about fiscal policy.</p>
<p>&quot;People are among other things uncertain about the attitude to the EMU question,&quot; Heikensten said.</p>
<p>Another key reason for the crown weakening could be the fears among money market playets about the positions they have taken, Heikensten said.</p>
<p>The crown has softened around six percent since October to a level of 4.5510 against the mark at midday Thursday.</p>
