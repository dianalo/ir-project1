<title>COLOMBIA: Colombian stocks end lower.</title>
<headline>Colombian stocks end lower.</headline>

<p>Colombian stocks ended lower for the ninth consecutive trading session, but brokers said the losing streak showed hopeful signs of losing steam.</p>
<p>Medellin's IBOMED general price index fell 0.18 percent, ending at 14,879.76 on volume of 1.4 billion pesos. Bogota's IBB closed down 0.16 percent, ending the week at 958.80 on volume of 1.08 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;The fall in the indices is beginning to slow and there was demand again today for Bavaria due to foreign fund buying,&quot; said a broker, adding there was speculative demand for Bancoquia after its stock fell this week on profit taking.  </p>
<p>Bavaria closed up 3.98 percent in Bogota at 5,511 pesos per share and up 3.77 percent in Medellin at 5,500. Bancoquia, in which Spain's Grupo Santander plans to buy a controlling 51 percent stake, was the day's biggest winner by far. It closed up 7.56 percent in Bogota at 2,700 pesos per share.</p>
<p>The Bogota index was weighed down by losers like cement maker Cementos Diamante, however, which fell 4.76 percent to close at 4,000 pesos. Corfivalle, another loser, dropped 2.22 percent to end at 2,200 pesos a share on what brokers said was selling by a foreign fund.  </p>
<p>Preferred shares in Corfivalle, an investment banking and loan corporation, edged up 0.24 percent in Medellin.</p>
<p>In addition to recent friction in U.S.-Colombia ties, brokers said foreign funds were cautious about Colombia because of recent economic emergency measures announced by the government of President Ernesto Samper. The measures include a 6 percent tax on foreign credits, something critics say looks certain to drive up the cost of imports and add to Colombia's gnawing inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;Many (foreign funds) have been taken aback by the change in rules of the game,&quot; said a broker in Medellin.</p>
