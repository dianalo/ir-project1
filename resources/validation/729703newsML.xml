<p>Italian stylist Gianni Versace, who was shot dead at his Miami mansion on Tuesday aged 50, was a constantly innovating designer who learned the basics of fashion from his mother and built a multi-million-dollar empire.</p>
<p>From a slow start in one of Italy's poorest areas, Versace went on to dress the likes of Princess Diana, singers Madonna, Sting and Elton John, actress Demi Moore and supermodel Naomi Campbell.</p>
<p>Even those with only scant dress sense remember the daring black Versace gown, held together at the side with silver safety pins, that voluptuous model Elizabeth Hurley wore to the 1994 London premiere of hit film &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;.</p>
<p>Versace, who switched styles and was constantly experimenting with new fabrics, said he saw himself primarily as a craftsman bringing fashion values up to date.</p>
<p>&quot;When I decided to make a couture collection and show it in Paris (in 1989) ... I didn't want to do haute couture as it was in the 40s and 50s,&quot; he told the Daily Telegraph newspaper last week at the Paris shows.</p>
<p>&quot;It can't exist in the same way in the 90s.&quot;</p>
<p>Versace started out in fashion as a schoolboy, watching his mother in her tailoring shop in Reggio Calabria in Italy's extreme south, one of the country's poorest regions.</p>
<p>In later years, he made his home at the most exclusive addresses in Rome, New York, London, Milan, Paris and Miami.</p>
<p>His early collections were classic, clean lines but he later began to explore brighter colours, metallic finishes and designs inspired by the antiquity of ancient Greece.</p>
<p>At last week's &quot;haute couture&quot; shows in Paris, he showed a collection consisting largely of tight black dresses with heavily padded, angular shoulders which he characterised as &quot;a kind of Byzantine minimalism&quot; and &quot;neo-Japanese&quot;.</p>
<p>But his avant-guarde was underpinned with traditional techniques that made his outfits hits with royalty and show business stars.</p>
<p>The grey-haired designer, who often sported stubble on his chin, was born on December 2, 1946. He moved to Milan at the age of 25 and drew his first pret-a-porter collection in 1972.</p>
<p>In 1978 he launched his own Gianni Versace label in a fashion show in Milan and began collaborating the following year with legendary fashion photographer Richard Avedon.</p>
<p>As well as fashion collections, he also designed costumes for ballet and was awarded the coveted American Fashion Oscar by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 1993.</p>
<p>Versace had been in partnership with his brother Santo and was planning a stockmarket float for his company, whose sales rose by 23.5 percent in 1996 to 845 billion lire ($483 million).</p>
