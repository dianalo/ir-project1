<p>U.S. debt futures ended with large gains and hugging day's highs when the market built on the morning's rise after the five-year Treasury note auction.</p>
<p>The auction produced a 6.165 percent high yield compared to forecasts for a 6.17/18 percent. The bid-cover ratio was 2.79 and non-competitive bids totaled $412 million.</p>
<p>Traders characterized response to the the auction, especially after Tuesday's lukewarm reception for the two-year issue, as average to fairly warm.</p>
<p>&quot;The chit-chat before the auction was that it was going to go fairly decent,&quot; said one T-bond futures floor broker.  </p>
<p>&quot;The five-year went pretty well,&quot; said another floor broker.</p>
<p>&quot;It (five-year auction) was okay,&quot; said a third T-bond futures floor broker. &quot;But I don't think it was a big deal.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders also said futures began firming again near midday when a dealer bought some 2,000 December futures minutes before the contract went off the boards at noon, which also buoyed values.</p>
<p>The move upward caused more shorts to bail out and also triggered buystops, the brokers agree, all of which contributed to the point-plus net daily gain.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was a good runup right before that (December T-bond futures) went off,&quot; said the second broker.</p>
<p>Gains in the dollar, which popped upward after unexpected shrinkage in the October U.S. trade deficit, plus strong U.S. stock market persuaded some shorts to cover, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It started out with the shortcovering rally, and earlier it (rise) had to do with the dollar's strength and the equities markets,&quot; said the first broker.</p>
<p>Unexpected weakness in the December Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions index also supported gains. The index fell to a -2.2 versus forecasts for 7.4 reading.  </p>
<p>Technically, Thursday's price action for March T-bonds constituted a daily key reversal, where the contract made a lower low, a higher and a higher settlement than on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The brokers said that formation could encourage buyers, although a daily reversal is not necessarily considered a strong or reliable pattern in T-bonds.</p>
<p>The first broker said he saw March T-bonds possibly edging up to test strong resistance at the 113-14/32 - 15/32 area.</p>
<p>March T-bonds closed up 1-03/32 at 113-05/32, notes rose 20/32 to 109-19/32, munis rose 1-03/32 to 116-01/32, bills added four bps to 94.98, Eurodollars rose three bps to 94.45. ((DerivativesDesk(312)408-8750/E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com))</p>
