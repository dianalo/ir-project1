<p>Romania's M2 money supply stayed almost unchanged in March, rising only 0.16 percent from the previous month when it saw a 12.6 percent increase, central bank (BNR) data showed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>M2 -- Romania's measure of broad money supply -- was 37.87 trillion lei at end-March, or 95.6 percent up year-on-year and 24.8 percent higher than at the end of 1996, BNR data showed.</p>
<p>Residents' hard currency deposits, which prompted the M2 rise earlier this year, fell to 13.8 trillion lei from 15.1 trillion in February, with population and private companies accounting for about 58 percent of the end-March figure.</p>
<p>Their stake in the broad money fell to 36.5 percent in March from 39.8 percent in February, with the domestic leu currency firming to 6,996 to the dollar at end-March from 7,744 the previous month.</p>
<p>The M1 narrow money, which include currency outside banks and demand deposits, was almost flat at 8.95 trillion lei.</p>
<p>Demand deposits saw a 7.3 percent fall to 4.21 trillion lei in March when cash in circulation rose to 4.74 trillion lei from 4.37 trillion the previous month.</p>
<p>Household savings went up by 9.6 percent to 10.98 trillion lei in March after a 6.9 percent rise in February as banks' deposit rates remained high -- up to an annual 135 percent on one-month -- under tough monetary policies aimed at fighting soaring inflation.</p>
<p>Romania's monthly inflation hit a record-high of 30.7 percent in March after fuel, energy and food prices were liberalised in mid-February.</p>
