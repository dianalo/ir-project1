<p>Here are the highlights of stories in the Danish press on Wednesday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>BERLINGSKE TIDENDE</p>
<p>--- The fishing industry's poor future prospects and bad image are stopping youngsters from becoming fishermen and if the trend does not change the lack of new fishermen could cause serious economic problems in parts of Denmark where fishing is of great importance.</p>
<p>POLITIKEN</p>
<p>--- Hospital employees who are careless about sanitation are the main cause of infections and contagious epidemics among patients at Danish hospitals. Ten percent of all patients at Danish hospitals get infected during hospitalization.</p>
<p>--- Tuesday and Wednesday next week Prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is to visit Danish IFOR forces in Bosnia with defence minister Hans Haekkerup and new defence chief Christian Hvidt. Nyrup Rasmussen says that he sees the visit as an important basis for the decision on Denmark's future engagement in Bosnia which is to be taken next month.</p>
<p>JYLLANDS POSTEN</p>
<p>--- New figures from Denmark's Statistics Office and a survey made by Jyllands Posten show that Denmark is undergoing a wealth boom with a faster growing standard of living than in the sixties. According to the figures the present increase in Danes' standard of living corresponds to a yearly increase of 3000 crowns per Dane compared to 2500 crowns in the sixties. BORSEN --- Former prime minster Poul Schluter is to step down from his post as one of the deputy chairmen of the European Parliament. Schluter says his decision is based on age and his wish to work more in politics than administration.</p>
