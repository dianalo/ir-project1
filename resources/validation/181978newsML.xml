<p>Pro-European members of parliament criticised Prime Minister John Major for threatening wrecking tactics unless the European Union reverses a European Court of Justice ruling imposing a 48-hour working week on Britain.</p>
<p>Conservative MP Edwina Currie said Major was right to seek labour market flexibility but should make his case in a convincing and dignified manner.</p>
<p>&quot;Thumping the table in Europe is childish, petulant and useless. It makes our partners turn away in disgust and they no longer listen to the serious points we make,&quot; Currie, vice-chairman of the European Movement, told a news conference.  </p>
<p>Labour MP Giles Radice, the chairman of the group, said the wide exemptions to the 48-hour-week directive meant it was far fetched to talk of Britain being crippled by it.</p>
<p>&quot;Rubbishing the ECJ is foolish because it is the Court which has enabled Britain to ensure that the single market is opened up to British exports,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Sir Jim Lester, a pro-European Conservative and a former employment minister, advised Major not to put Britain on a collision course with Europe over the directive.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's possibly wrong to try and make it into a big issue,&quot; he told Channel Four television.  </p>
<p>Major threatened to block the Inter Governmental Conference on streamlining the EU's institutions as a prelude to welcoming new members unless Britain got its way on the 48-hour week.</p>
<p>Lester said he would not want to try to convince his constituents that it was not a good thing that they had three weeks paid holiday a year -- another of the provisions.</p>
<p>He also disputed Major's premise that the European Commission was wrong to have introduced the directive as a health and safety measure and not under the social chapter, from which Britain has an opt-out. &quot;Nobody could argue that working long hours isn't a health and safety question,&quot; Lester said.</p>
