<p>Sudanese opposition groups have agreed to escalate a military and political campaign to topple the Islamist government in Khartoum, Sudan's former prime minister said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sadeq al-Mahdi said recent talks in Eritrea between opposition leaders ...&quot;resulted in ... restructuring the joint military command of the different groups to make it more cohesive and to plan an escalation of the military activity against the regime.&quot;</p>
<p>He also told Reuters in an interview in Cairo that they discussed ways to enhance political pressure on Khartoum.</p>
<p>&quot;We have discussed all the needed activity to escalate.&quot;</p>
<p>Mahdi, who escaped from Khartoum in December and is on the opposition's leadership council, was at the Eritrea talks in June as a rebel National Democratic Alliance (NDA) member.</p>
<p>Senior Sudan opposition officials -- including Democratic Unionist Party's Moulana al-Mirghani, Sudan People's Liberation Army's (SPLA) John Garang, Umma's Mubarak al-Mahdi, and Sudanese Alliance Forces' Abdul Aziz Khalid, attended the talks.</p>
<p>Mahdi was speaking ahead of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) regional summit to take place in Kenya on July 8 and 9. It will tackle the civil war in Sudan and its stormy ties with neighbouring Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda.</p>
<p>IGAD groups those five countries, as well as Somalia and Djibouti, and aims to help settle conflicts in the region.</p>
<p>The Sudan government newspaper Al-Anbaa reported on Friday that American, European and African efforts were underway to arrange a meeting between the SPLA's Garang and Sudan's President Lt-General Omar Hassan Al-Bashir at the IGAD summit.</p>
<p>Al Anbaa said the purpose of any such meeting is to consider &quot;expanding the Khartoum peace agreement so that the sides bearing arms in the south of the land can join.&quot;</p>
<p>Sudan signed in April an accord with a number of factions intended to end civil war mostly led by the SPLA, which has fought since 1983 for greater autonomy of the Christian and animist south from the Moslem, Arabised north.</p>
<p>The SPLA, which rejects the accord as one between allies, launched a series of successful offensives this year and recaptured a string of towns and villages.</p>
<p>The NDA launched attacks into Sudan from Eritrea in January, initially capturing several towns and prompting Sudan to order a general mobilisation which halted the rebel advance.</p>
<p>Sudan's ties with Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda are strained over accusations they support the rebels, a charge they deny.</p>
<p>Mahdi said he expected the IGAD summit to revise its 1994 declarations to reflect the recent changes in the Sudan war.</p>
<p>&quot;The war was straightforward in 1994. It was a National Islamic Front (NIF) conflict with the SPLA,&quot; he said. &quot;Today it involves a north-north conflict and a Sudan-neighbours conflict. We expect that the IGAD powers...will look into this and perhaps update their initiative.&quot;</p>
