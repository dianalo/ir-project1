<p>Burundi's Hutu rebels destroyed electricity pylons supplying the capital on Wednesday and threatened to shoot down any plane breaking regional sanctions by flying into Bujumbura.</p>
<p>Officials at state-run electricity company Regidiso told Reuters that rebels pulled down pylons just as engineers were about to restore power to the city cut off since Saturday when rebels cut power lines in northern Bubanza province.</p>
<p>&quot;The sabotage has continued. There is no technical problem restoring power to the capital, but when we are nearly finished they come and pull down the pylons again,&quot; a senior Regidiso official said by telephone.</p>
<p>The sabotage has forced the sanctions-hit city to draw upon dwindling fuel stocks to keep basic water supplies, hospitals and schools running.</p>
<p>Regional leaders imposed sanctions on landlocked Burundi after a July 25 army coup against civilian Hutu president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya by Pierre Buyoya, a retired Tutsi army major.</p>
<p>In the Kenyan capital Nairobi, the exiled main Hutu rebel group threatened to shoot down any plane flying into Bujumbura.</p>
<p>&quot;We have information some foreign planes are landing in Bujumbura in defiance of regional sanctions,&quot; Innocent Nimpagaritse, East Africa representative of the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;From today onwards, any plane flying into Bujumbura without clearance from our forces will be shot down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>CNDD is the political wing of the rebel Forces for the Defence of Democracy (FDD) which is waging a ferocious guerrilla war against the Tutsi-dominated army.</p>
<p>Aid workers say 1,000 people are dying monthly. More than 150,000 people have been killed in ethnic bloodletting in Burundi since the country's first elected president, a member of the Hutu majority, was killed by Tutsi soldiers in an attempted coup.</p>
<p>In another statement CNDD accused Burundian businessmen of breaking sanctions by flying to the northern provinces of Ngozi and Kirundo and then infiltrating into Rwanda with the complicity of local authorities.</p>
<p>Jean-Luc Ndizeye, a spokesman for Burundi's military leader, rejected the latest CNDD statement.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't have the technical capacity to do that and if they do shoot a plane coming in or out of Bujumbura then it will just be another one of their crimes,&quot; Ndizeye told Reuters.</p>
<p>Burundi's new Tutsi-dominated government invited the United Nations to send more human rights monitors to the small tea and coffee-growing nation.</p>
<p>&quot;On behalf of the government I am requesting a considerable increase in the number of human rights observers in Burundi,&quot; Foreign Minister Luc Rukingama said in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</p>
<p>His request followed charges by the London-based human rights group Amnesty International that the army was carrying out widespread killings despite Buyoya's pledge to end the carnage.</p>
<p>Amnesty said last week 4,050 unarmed civilians were buried across Giheta area after being killed by the army between July 27 and August 10.</p>
