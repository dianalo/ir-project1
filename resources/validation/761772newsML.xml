<p>Electrical and refrigeration group Stantronic Ltd, listed two months ago, said on Tuesday it had made two acquisitions worth R27.7 million, which could push its turnover to over R100 million annually.</p>
<p>The company said it had bought Legal Computer Systems' (LCS) Equitrac and Benchmark affiliates for R24.3 million.</p>
<p>The purchase is to be settled by the issue of 21 million Stantronic shares at 100 cents each, and 3,724,510 shares by vendor placement at 102 cents a share.</p>
<p>Of the total, 20.7 million will be held in escrow and will be listed progressively on the JSE over three years.</p>
<p>Stantronic also bought refrigeration businesses Dynstemp Engineering and Dynatemp Engineering Natal, belonging to the Dynatemp group, for R3.40 million.</p>
<p>In the second deal Stantronic will issue a total of 2,434,715 shares at 112 cents a share and 668,353 shares at 102 cents a share by vendor placement. Of the total, 2,434,715 shares will be held in escrow and listed over three years.</p>
<p>&quot;The purchase of the businesses of the LCS group introduces a new division to the Stantronic group,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Among the effects will be that Stantronic will be capitalised at over R200 million this year and that the group turnover could pass R100 million -- two years ahead of schedule -- with the refrigeration division surging past electrical in turnover,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>Conditions of the purchase is that the move is approved by the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, and an additional 4,212,863 Stantronic ordinary shares are issued by the bourse, the company said.</p>
<p>Stantronic was listed on June 2 this year.</p>
