<p>The head of Russia's Orthodox Church Alexiy II on Sunday appealed to trade unions planning a national day of strikes next Thursday to keep their protests peaceful and avoid violent clashes.</p>
<p>&quot;God grant that these actions on March 27 be peaceful, calm and not lead to complications in the life of our society,&quot; he told Russian television in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;This expression of discontent should not grow into confrontation, hostility and aggression,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Trade union leaders expect around seven million workers across the vast Russian Federation to take part in the nationwide day of action, which is supported by President Boris Yeltsin's communist opponents in parliament.</p>
<p>The unions are protesting against chronic delays in the payment of wages and pensions.</p>
<p>On Saturday Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin ordered that security arrangements be beefed up ahead of the protests and asked regional leaders to make extra efforts to pay off wage arrears.</p>
<p>Alexiy, 67, has often spoken out against wage and pension arrears and has expressed concern about the growing gap in Russia between the wealthy few and a majority that struggles to make ends meet.</p>
<p>On Sunday he defended the church's right to comment on pressing social issues but added that the church also opposed actions that might fuel clashes between citizens and the authorities.</p>
<p>Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, Alexiy has been freed of state ideological control and has tried to carve out a broader role for the church.</p>
<p>He said the number of functioning churches in Moscow alone had grown from 43 to 295 in the past eight years.</p>
