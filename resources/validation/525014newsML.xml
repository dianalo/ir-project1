<title>USA: NYMEX Hub natgas still down late with cash.</title>
<headline>NYMEX Hub natgas still down late with cash.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-21</dateline>

<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures remained slightly lower late Monday in moderate trade, in line with reports of some softness in the cash, though prices remained in recent technical ranges, sources said.</p>
<p>At 1355 EDT, May was still down by 1.6 cents at $2.065 per million British thermal units, while June was 1.8 cents lower at $2.124. Other deferreds were down by 0.3 to 2.2 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;I think May will go off (expire) somewhere between $2.00 and $2.09,&quot; said one Texas-based trader, adding softness in cash this morning spilled into the futures pits, particularly after an eight percent rally late last week.  </p>
<p>With relatively cool Midwest and Northeast weather expected for most of the week, many agreed prices were likely to remain stuck in recent ranges.</p>
<p>But some were concerned about comfortable stock levels and the likely arrival of milder spring temperatures soon.</p>
<p>And with open interest climbing to record levels last week on the rally, others expected some sort of a long liquidation or profit taking pullback near-term.</p>
<p>NYMEX May natgas goes off the board Thursday, April 24.</p>
<p>Chart traders pegged near-support in May at $2.035, with further buying seen at $1.925, $1.88, $1.85 and $1.825. Key resistance was quoted at $2.095, the intraday high from March 10, with a break above that level likely to lead to a test of the $2.16 area.</p>
<p>In the cash, Gulf Coast prices were steady to down slightly at about $2.05. Midcontinent pipes showed similar movement to the low-to-mid $1.90s. Gas at the New York city gate fell by about five cents to the mid-to-high $2.30s.</p>
<p>NYMEX said 22,072 Hub contracts traded at 1325 EDT.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, May remained 1.2 cents lower at $1.94, while deferreds were steady to down by one-half cent. The East/West spread narrowed by 0.4 cent to 12.5 cents (NYMEX premium).</p>
<p>KCBT May natgas expires Friday, April 25.</p>
