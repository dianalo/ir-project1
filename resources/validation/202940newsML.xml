<text>
<p>Malaysian palm oil prices ended with smaller declines as late covering helped the market recoup earlier losses, traders said. Falls in soyoil weakened prices initially.</p>
<p>News of export data by SGS (M) Sdn Bhd and expectations India will reduce edible oil imports in coming months had no impact on the market. &quot;The news had no impact on the market as people claimed that it was an old story,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>India is expected to reduce purchases in the coming months following good oilseed crop arrivals and adequate palm olein stocks, industry officials in India said on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;New crop arrivals are gathering momentum and we have sufficient inventories of imported palm olein,&quot; Navinbhai Shah, president of Bombay Oilseeds and Oil Exchange Ltd, told Reuters in India by telephone. &quot;Therefore imports in the coming three to four months will drop substantially,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>India imported an average 80,000 to 100,000 tonnes of palm olein per month during September, October and November. In the next three to four months, India will import a maximum of 40,000 to 50,000 tonnes of palm olein per month, Shah said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cargo surveyor SGS (M) Sdn Bhd said that November 1-20 palm oil exports were at 462,394 tonnes.  </p>
<p>&quot;The SGS export data has no impact on the market as it was within market expectations,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Technically, traders said the support for third month, February futures contract is still pegged at 1,200 ringgit.</p>
<p>At the close, the contract was seven ringgit down at 1,207 ringgit ($479.16) a tonne after trading between the 1,213 and 1,199 ringgit level.</p>
<p>Turnover on the futures market was 1,625 lots against 1,342 on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>In the physical market, Nov (south) crude palm oil was offered at 1,205 ringgit after trading from 1,195 to 1,205. Bid for Nov (south) was 1,202.50 ringgit.</p>
