<p>The final phase in selecting a jury to try the wrongful death civil lawsuit against O.J. Simpson began on Tuesday with the former football star in attendance, closely following the proceedings.</p>
<p>Simpson, who was found not guilty last October of the June 12, 1994, murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, avoided making eye contact with any of the 50 potential jurors who were ushered into the courtroom of Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki.</p>
<p>He watched quietly as jurors were questioned by attorneys, donning glasses during breaks to read newspaper sports pages or transcripts of depositions. The Football Hall of Famer is being sued by the families of the victims seeking financial compensation from him for the loss of their loved ones.</p>
<p>Of the 50 potential jurors present on Tuesday, 12 were chosen at random to sit in the jury box to be questioned by attorneys from both sides.</p>
<p>After a long meeting with the lawyers in his chambers, Fujisaki dismissed two of the 12, a white woman who appeared to be in her 30s and a black woman in her late 20s or early 30s. Both had indicated in their jury questionnaires that they had issues to discuss with the judge in private.</p>
<p>The total number of potential jurors left is 100 of the original pool of more than 200. Apart from the two women excused on Tuesday, the others were let go for hardship reasons or because they had formed firm opinions from following the nine-month criminal trial last year.</p>
<p>Of the 100, 12 will be chosen for the final panel and eight will be picked to serve as alternate jurors. The final phase was expected to last for more than a week. The first group chosen for questioning on Tuesday consisted of five whites, five blacks and two Latinos.</p>
<p>Also present were Fred and Kim Goldman, the father and sister of Ronald Goldman, who sat in the front row of the public gallery. At one point Kim Goldman stared intently at Simpson, who was sitting with his lawyers.</p>
<p>The first three people to be questioned, a Latino man who works for the U.S. Postal Service, a black woman who was formerly a court clerk and a white woman who works as an airline stewardess, were questioned closely on the issues of race, whether Simpson's celebrity status would influence them and whether pressure from friends and family to reach a certain verdict might sway them.</p>
<p>The racial issue has dominated the jury selection process. Simpson is black and the victims were white. Prosecutors in the criminal case accused Simpson's defence team of playing &quot;the race card&quot; to appeal to the mainly black jury.</p>
<p>The former court clerk told Daniel Petrocelli, who represents the Goldman family, that black people viewed racial issues differently from white people, saying &quot;You know&quot; at one point and then adding, &quot;No, you don't.&quot; Petrocelli is white.</p>
