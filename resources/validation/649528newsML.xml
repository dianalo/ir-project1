<headline>Belgrade bourse activity mixed in week to June 6.</headline>
<dateline>BELGRADE 1997-06-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Belgrade Stock Exchange (BSE) reported on Tuesday a 10.75 percent increase in its total turnover during the week ending June 6, but its primary market activity fell 35.9 percent due to declining investor interest.</p>
<p>Total BSE turnover stood at 59.018 million dinars ($10.37 million) in 164 deals, including renewed primary sale of shares worth 14.9 million dinars.</p>
<p>In the week ending May 30, the bourse reported its turnover at 52.388 million dinars in 209 transactions, entirely perfomed on the primary market.</p>
<p>Traders said primary market activity declined substantially in the week to June 6 due to lower investor interest and decreasing number of creditworthy issuers. Market liquidity remained largely unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;The size of funds on this market is fairly stable but there is some saturation on the demand side. Issuing companies frequently withdraw from the market because they find some other way to borrow,&quot; a trader told Reuters.</p>
<p>For the week ending June 6, the BSE reported the following details:</p>
<p>* Commercial paper traded 147 times for a volume of 23.688 million dinars.</p>
<p>* Treasury bills accounted for nine transactions worth 1.54 million dinars.</p>
<p>Interest rates on commercial paper and treasury bills ranged between 9.00 and 16.00 percent per month, with nearly 80 percent of the deals concluded at the lower end of the range.</p>
<p>Traders expect interest rates to decline further to eight percent per month due to lower demand and fairly stable liquidity of the most important issuing companies.</p>
<p>Brokers said commercial paper issued by Dinara trading company, Hemofarm drug producer, PKB Frikom food processor and Soko Stark confectionary maker have been the most actively traded for months now.</p>
<p>&quot;Those would be the first companies to enter the BSE list A once it is established,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>* State T-bills traded six times for a total of 18.2 million dinars. The state issued a total of 100 million dinars worth of T-bills in two tranches maturing in 30 and 60 days. Until the end of last week it sold a total of 50.3 million dinars worth of T-bills, which it first put on sale on May 12.</p>
<p>* In a subdued secondary market activity, the National Bank of Yugoslavia sold a further 0.69 million dinars worth of bonds from its portfolio. Bonds are issued by the Serbian Commodity Reserve Agency.</p>
<p>* The bourse reported no trade in the NBY short-term bonds.</p>
<p>* Over-the-counter trade in commercial paper and treasury bills fell to 32.9 million dinars from 39.486 million in the previous week.</p>
<p>* OTC trade in giro-money, with banks trading their surplus liquidity rose to 25.2 million from 24.4 million dinars a week ago. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
