<p>TransCanada PipeLines Ltd chief executive George Watson said on Thursday the company had garnered more requests for firm natural gas transport capacity for its planned 1998 expansion than it could honor and had to cut some prospective shippers off.</p>
<p>The cutoff at 470 million cubic feet per day of new capacity -- part of TransCanada's staged Nexus expansion project -- came even before the close of the company's open season slated for the end of April, Watson said.</p>
<p>The company is already set to add almost 300 million cubic feet per day of capacity on its Canadian mainliine this year. The total Nexus program of expansions through the turn of the century could mean as much as C$1.4 billion in construction costs.</p>
<p>He said the size of the 1999 expansion would depend on market conditions as the year approached, but suggested that the need for new capacity then may be overestimated with the price differential between Alberta and NYMEX gas now narrowing.</p>
<p>&quot;The basin differentials have gone away which tells you that...the gas is not locked. All the gas that needs to move can move,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Higher prices, however, would likely mean another round of gas drilling activity and possibly another jump in supply, he said.</p>
<p>A lack of sufficient pipeline space out of Alberta had for several years often been blamed on deep price discounts for Canadian gas.</p>
<p>Watson said TransCanada's strategy of staging its expansions to meet annual market conditions gave it the advantange over the producer-backed Alliance Pipeline proposal, which would ship 1.3 billion cubic feet a day of gas to Chicago from northeastern British Columbia.</p>
<p>The Nexus expansion is aimed at meeting a spate of export pipeline plans being proposed by TransCanada and other Canadian and U.S. pipeline companies.</p>
<p>The new pipelines and expansions would ship gas to U.S. Midwest and Northeast markets from the TransCanada system.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know who the winning projects are. The markets will tell us where they want to go,&quot; Watson said.</p>
<p>&quot;But this is one case where the tortoise might win, because you are able to increment into the market each and every year. So, maybe the Nexus tortoise beats the Alliance rabbit.&quot;</p>
