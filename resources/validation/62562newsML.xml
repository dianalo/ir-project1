<p>Slim profits and heated competition from expanding Asian refineries spell bleak times ahead for the business of refining crude oil in Singapore for third parties, industry sources say.</p>
<p>The dwindling of third-party processing business was also due to refiners' growing reluctance to seal new spot or term contracts, as they prefer to refine their own crudes and sell the products themselves, refiners and traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Refiners want to keep the refining space for themselves,&quot; one refiner said. &quot;Why should you want to process for other traders who will compete for the market. Now the market is so global, unlike in the past when sellers had exclusive markets.&quot;</p>
<p>Under a third party arrangement, a refiner processes an agreed volume of crudes for outside trader or foreign oil firms for a fee. The processee will take the refined products based on a yield ratio, or the breakdown of products.</p>
<p>The refiner said if refining margins were good, refiners were more reluctant to process for others, while if margins were bad those seeking processing space would stay away.</p>
<p>Between June and early August, refiners were losing money and some cut production. Late in August, things got better, but now operations are back in the red for primary processing -- the first stage -- and refiners are getting a slim $1-per-barrel profit for complex processing.</p>
<p>Refiners attribute this to volatile crude prices amid continued tensions in the Gulf. They remained bearish on the fourth quarter outlook, which normally is the best time of the year as winter demand emerges.</p>
<p>Currently, two refiners are processing for others. Singapore Petroleum Corp (SPC), which previously used up to 80 percent of its capacity for third parties, now refines just 40,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude for Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC).</p>
<p>SPC has a 40-percent stake in the 285,000-bpd Singapore Refining Co refinery and now uses just 35 percent of that capacity to process crude for KPC.</p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell occasionally processes 5,000-10,000 bpd for China's SINOCHEM at its 420,000 bpd refining complex.</p>
<p>This is a far cry from the heyday of the business just a few years ago. Italy's Agip Petroli had a 10-year deal with SPC which ended early this year. SPC also had deals with Total, Japan's Idemitsu and Cosmo Oil. The European firms are said to be talking with SPC on new deals.</p>
<p>Cosmo also had a deal to process 5,000 bpd at Mobil Oil, which ended last year, while Mitsubishi Oil had a deal with British Petroleum and Chevron with Caltex.</p>
<p>Traders said higher Asian refining capacity, with South Korea and Thailand adding around 900,000 bpd by the end of the year, was making third-parties more concerned about the fees and yield ratio.</p>
<p>Increased capacity is also expected from Malaysia, while Indonesian and Philippine refineries are being upgraded. A new refinery is expected in Vietnam by 2000. Refiners in Singapore are upgrading to improve quality and stay competitive.</p>
<p>Traders said they were unwilling to strike a deal if refiners sought a fee of more than $1.50 per barrel and if the yield ratio did not favour higher value products like diesel and kerosene, which are in greater demand.</p>
<p>Traders said poor refining margins made it unprofitable to continue processing as they had to pay more for crudes while bearing the brunt of high processing fees.</p>
<p>Although prices, especially for diesel, have improved, the overall rise in product prices has not kept pace with rising crude prices. Very often, the traders said, they have to resell their products to the refiner.</p>
