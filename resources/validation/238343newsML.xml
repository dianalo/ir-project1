<p>Dutch carrier KLM's buy-back of around one billion guilders' worth of state-owned shares gained a mixed reception from analysts on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;In the short term it's a very nice move, but in the long term it will not make any contribution to corporate growth,&quot; said Gert Jochems, airlines analyst with broker NIB Strating.</p>
<p>KLM said on Thursday it was buying back and withdrawing 17.3 million state-owned ordinary shares at a cost of around one billion guilders, thereby reducing the Dutch government's stake to 25 percent from a current 38.2 percent.</p>
<p>Other analysts said the fact that KLM was involved in what was essentially an asset management move could be construed as a sign that it lacked strategic imagination.</p>
<p>&quot;In the absence of business style you get asset management,&quot; said an analyst who declined to be named.</p>
<p>Corne Zandbergen of Generale Bank said buy-backs could be interpreted as a sign of weakness, but added: &quot;One should not see it so negatively. In the U.S. it is quite customary for companies to buy back their own shares.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's sensible for KLM to do something with their cash pile and this is an effective way of using it given it will boost earnings per share,&quot; Zandbergen said.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless it's a one-off move...real improvements to the quality of earnings will still have to come from their Focus 2000 (restructuring) programme,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A reduction in the state stake could also make KLM more attractive to foreign investors and possible partners, although government interference in the airline had never been a problem.</p>
<p>&quot;I can see that the division (between state and airline) could be more sharply drawn...Majority state-owned airlines have a bit of a bad name,&quot; Zandbergen said.</p>
<p>&quot;The reduction of the state's stake is an ideologically important step,&quot; analyst Bert Hoogenhuyze of brokers Amstgeld agreed. &quot;The U.S. will see the way KLM is headed...that it's definitely not a state dependent like, say, Air France.&quot;</p>
<p>As such its chances of a link-up with other commercial airlines could be enhanced, and merger speculation would continue to underpin the stock's price, he said.</p>
<p>Jochems said he was unhappy at the increase in gearing resulting from the reduction in shareholders' equity.</p>
<p>&quot;Gearing will go back up to 130 percent (from 95 percent) -- I think that's on the high side,&quot; he said, adding KLM had always targeted a net debt to equity ratio of less than 100 percent.</p>
<p>But Zandbergen said he did not regard this as a problem, seeing it as a temporary, unavoidable setback in a continuing drive to improve equity ratios.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't have your cake and eat it,&quot; he said. &quot;Focus 2000 will put the company back on course.&quot;</p>
<p>Generale had reduced its KLM recommendation to hold after the shares picked up to 47 guilders on news of the buy-back.</p>
<p>&quot;We had it on a structural hold prior to last week's news the company was planning a buy-back, after which we upgraded to a trading buy,&quot; Zandbergen said.</p>
<p>&quot;At this price (47-48 guilders) the shares are once more a hold,&quot; he said.</p>
