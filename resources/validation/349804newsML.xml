<p>AMLC COMMENTARY: The rain proved beneficial for cattle markets this week, restricting supplies and forcing prices much higher than those endured througout most of January.</p>
<p>Excellent rainfall fell across vast areas of central and northern New South Wales and most of central Queensland.</p>
<p>Many areas on the coast were deluged with rainfall in excess of 150mm during the week.</p>
<p>This should assist markets in the short term by reducing offerings in New South Wales and Queensland and providing restocker competition from these states in Victorian markets.</p>
<p>Extremely cold weather in the U.S. mid section continued to cause concern. This prolonged difficult weather has reduced cow supplies considerably.</p>
<p>This has been a primary factor in last week's price increases for lean grinding meat, as cow prices have risen significantly. A second important influence on the grinding beef sector at present is a relative shortage of frozen lean meat supplies.</p>
<p>The retailer ground beef business remains more subdued than a few weeks ago, but is still described as good. The foodservice business on the other hand remains mediocre.</p>
<p>Trading activity for imported beef was slow until midweek and offerings were light to moderate.</p>
<p>U.S. domestic boneless beef prices rose sharply on Wednesday and imported prices followed.</p>
<p>As the table indicates ,prices for Australian grinding beef in general rose 2-2.25 USc/lb. Market participants reported user activity as weak, which is usual during this time.</p>
<p>Trader interest appeared to be covering short positions and was very active on both Wednesday and Thursday (U.S. time).</p>
<p>Supplies of imported lean grinding beef for spot delivery appeared limited this week.</p>
<p>In the Japanese market, developments this week were dominated by the continued weakening of the yen against the US$.</p>
<p>The current rate (US$1.00=122 yen) is the highest level the US$ has reached against the yen since February 1993.</p>
<p>The rate reached US$1=85 in mid-1995 and has since drifted out of Japan's favour.</p>
<p>The weakening of this rate in effect makes imported beef more expensive to Japanese traders, as a greater number of yen is required to purchase one US$, the currency in which beef is traded in Japan.</p>
<p>It will be very interesting to see the effects of the current cold snap on January placement levels.</p>
<p>If movements into feedlots are again low during January, U.S. supplies could begin to tighten from April onwards.</p>
