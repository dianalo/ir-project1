<headline>Dow Jones index starts week at new high, 6,000 in sight.</headline>

<p>Two weeks into September, with the clouds of inflation and higher interest rates suddenly blown aside, Wall Street is poised to stage its long-delayed summer rally.</p>
<p>Nearly four months after peaking in May only to tumble some 10 percent in a broad sell-off in July, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finally reached a new record high on Friday, as investors received the final piece in a two-week puzzle that showed the economy was still growing and inflation was in check.</p>
<p>The market-friendly economic numbers -- a producer price index that edged up 0.3 percent in August and a consumer price index that inched up 0.1 percent -- confirmed that inflation was not accelerating.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Dow industrials surged 66.58 points to end at 5,838.52, eclipsing the old record close of 5,778.00 set on May 22. The Dow had met with stubborn resistance in previous attempts to push above 5,800, and analysts said a sustained rally toward 6,000 was now likely.</p>
<p>&quot;Momentum is on the side of the bull again,&quot; said Marshall Acuff, a portfolio strategist at Smith Barney. &quot;Cash has been building up over the summer, and the August numbers show individuals have been buying mutual funds more aggressively.&quot;</p>
<p>The economic news had some analysts shying away from forecasts of even a slight monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve at its Sept. 24 interest rate policy meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd say there's less than a 50-50 chance, but there's still a decent chance the Fed will tighten,&quot; said Arnie Kaufman, editor of Standard &amp; Poor's Outlook investment advisory newsletter.</p>
<p>&quot;The good news is the market has been able to do so well in the face of a still-existing possibility the Fed will tighten,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>With buying interest extending beyond the blue chips the late-summer rally showed signs it could pick up steam.</p>
<p>Technology stocks in particular showed new life, as investment firms voiced fresh optimism about the group. One firm, SoundView Financial Group, upgraded the entire sector, based on its belief the group will outperform the market in coming months.</p>
<p>To be sure, questions remain amid the positive signs.</p>
<p>One looming concern is that the market faces a period when companies typically announce warnings about their earnings for the latest quarter.</p>
<p>A second involves the simple fact that interest rates remain a critical open question until the Fed actually meets later this month.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Fed doesn't raise rates maybe that's a reason for this to run for a while,&quot; Acuff said. &quot;If the Fed does raise rates, it could stop this thing in its tracks.&quot;</p>
<p>Economic data due this week include Monday's report on business inventories, Tuesday's industrial production and capacity utilization data and Wednesday's international trade figures. Weekly jobless claims, monthly housing starts and Philadelphia Fed survey results are all due Thursday.</p>
