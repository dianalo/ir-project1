<p>Asia Securities International Ltd said in Wednesday it sought to raise capital to finance property development projects in China with a two-for-one rights issue priced at HK$1.26 per rights share.</p>
<p>If all shareholders take up the issue, a total of 348.15 rights shares will be issued and the total amount raised would be HK$438.7 million before expenses, the company said.</p>
<p>The issue price represents a 34.4 percent discount to the closing price of HK$1.92 per share on November 11. It represents a 40.5 percent discount to HK$2.12, the average closing prices of the previous 10 trading days, and a 25.9 percent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price of HK$1.70 per share, it said.</p>
<p>Estimated net proceeds from the issue of HK$373.7 million are to be invested in infrastructure and property development projects in China.</p>
<p>The group intends to apply HK$100 million toward the repayment of a bank loan, taken out to acquire the group's 60-percent owned Xidan property development project in Beijing.</p>
<p>The remaining 40-percent is held by Beijing Huayuan Property Company Limited.</p>
<p>The remaining HK$273.7 million will be used for the development of the group's existing projects and as general working capital.</p>
<p>The company issued HK$160 million in convertible bonds on September 6. The three-year, 1.5 percent fixed-rate notes are convertible into ordinary shares at a conversion price of HK$1.84 per share and convertible from September 6, 1997.</p>
<p>However, in the event of a rights issue, a fixed conversion rate of HK$1.84 will be set for notes converted before January 1, 1997. Full conversion of the notes would result in the issue of 86.96 million shares, about 12.5 percent of the enlarged share capital of the company, and entitled to take up the rights issue.</p>
<p>An extraordinary general meeting is tentatively planned for December 2, 1996, the notice said.</p>
<p>Trading in the company's shares, suspended on Tuesday, will resume on November 13, its said.</p>
