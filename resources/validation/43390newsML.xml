<p>Hutu rebels have murdered the Roman Catholic archbishop of Burundi and three other people in an ambush on his car, the army said on Tuesday citing witnesses who saw his body burning and retrieved the body of a dead nun.</p>
<p>An army spokesman said Archbishop Joachim Ruhuna, Burundi's most senior Catholic cleric and a member of the Tutsi minority, was ambushed on the way to the central town of Gitega on Monday.</p>
<p>A Burundian nun from Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity religious order and two other people, so far not identified, were also killed in the attack. Three other people travelling in the car were missing.</p>
<p>&quot;He is definitely dead. A deacon saw his body burning in the car,&quot; spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Longin Minani told Reuters.</p>
<p>The archbishop, two nuns, two schoolgirls, an accountant and a driver were travelling in the car when it was ambushed at Murongwe, five km (three miles) north of Bugendana village, in an area described by aid workers as a Hutu rebel stronghold.</p>
<p>Minani said a Catholic deacon and others heard the attack on the car and managed to drag the corpse of one of the two nuns out of the vehicle and hide it in a building.</p>
<p>Minani said the burning body of the archbishop was too heavy to lift, and when they returned to the ambush site it was gone.</p>
<p>&quot;The rebels probably threw it in the river. That's where they (soldiers) are searching now,&quot; Minani said.</p>
<p>The 62-year-old archbishop was booed at a funeral for 304 Tutsi massacre victims in Bugendana on July 23, when he said there were extremists among both the Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority in the ethnically-split country.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no names for this. I have seen it many times but I condemn violence on both sides,&quot; the archbishop said.</p>
<p>Angry Tutsi mourners also pelted President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya with rocks and cow dung, forcing the head of state to flee the funeral by helicopter. Two days later the Hutu president was toppled in a coup by the Tutsi-dominated army under retired major Pierre Buyoya.</p>
<p>A Roman Catholic peace group, the Rome-based Sant'Egidio Community, expressed horror at Ruhuna's reported murder.</p>
<p>It said Ruhuna had been a man of peace who had &quot;never stopped preaching moderation and seeking dialogue&quot; despite the killing of several members of his own family in 1993.</p>
<p>His assassination was &quot;a personalised horror that adds itself to the horror of the massacres and the tragedy of a Burundi that finds no peace,&quot; the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>Sant'Egidio, which has mounted peace efforts in many of the world's troublespots, has received several key figures in the Burundi conflict, including Hutu rebel leader Leonard Nyangoma.</p>
<p>&quot;In the light of this episode, the Sant'Egidio community ...reaffirms the need to reach a negotiated solution to the conflict as soon as possible so as to interrupt the terrible spiral of violence and vendettas,&quot; the group said.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels even more committed to finding ways to (secure) the necessary dialogue.&quot;</p>
<p>More than 150,000 people have been killed in three years of massacres and civil war between the army and rebels in Burundi, the southern neighbour of Rwanda where one million people, mostly Tutsis, were slaughtered in ethnic bloodshed in 1994.</p>
<p>The army spokesman and witnesses said another two people were killed in ambushes near the northern town of Bugerama on Tuesday after four people died in a similar attack in the south on Monday.</p>
