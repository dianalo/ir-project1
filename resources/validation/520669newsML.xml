<headline>INTERVIEW-Suncor CEO sees &quot;strategic&quot; U.S. link.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Suncor Energy Inc, a Canadian integrated oil concern, is pursuing a &quot;strategic&quot; link with a U.S. refiner as part of plans to raise its profile south of the border, the company's chief executive said Friday.</p>
<p>Suncor made its U.S. capital markets debut Friday with a listing on the New York Stock Exchange at $45, part of an effort to bring in more U.S. shareholders, particularly retail investors, Richard George, Suncor president and chief executive, said in an interview with Reuters.  </p>
<p>For its refinery deal, the company is focusing on the U.S. Rocky Mountain and Midwest regions and may enter into a &quot;Venezuelan-style&quot; partnership, George said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our thrust is probably a little like Venezuela. We are looking for that synergistic advantage so that we could make more money than the current owners. It doesn't mean we are going to buy; it could be a joint venture, a processing deal,&quot; George said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a team of people that are looking at this...going through a complete study of which refineries might be suitable ...but it's early days.&quot;  </p>
<p>George said he hadn't opened up talks with any company, but there are a number in the region which already have said they are looking at alliances or are up for sale, including Ashland Inc, Amoco Corp, Clark and USX-Marathon Group.</p>
<p>However, unlike the large scale consolidation seen in the U.S. refining and marketing sector -- such as the $10 billion Texaco Inc /Shell Oil Co / Aramco merger and big takeovers by Tosco Corp and Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp -- Suncor is driven by desire to secure a home for its growing supply of crude from its oil sands production in Fort McMurray, Alberta.  </p>
<p>That is set to grow to 85,000 barrels per day (bpd) after a plant maintenance this spring, and to 105,000 bpd by 1999.</p>
<p>Growing production from the offshore sector of the Gulf of Mexico and from Latin American producers will coincide with growing Canadian production and make strategic downstream links crucial for producers.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question we are likely to see an interface between heavy oil being pushed up from Gulf of Mexico and heavy oil coming from Canada. Where that line is going to be I'm not sure, but probably south of Chicago,&quot; George said.  </p>
<p>George reckons Suncor has several advantages over other Canadian producers.</p>
<p>One such is that Suncor's rising oil production is primarily &quot;light&quot; and &quot;sweet,&quot; while most of the increased production in the region is of the heavier variety, a factor which already this year has pushed the relative price of heavy crudes down sharply compared with lighter varieties. The lighter oil is cheaper to process and many refineries still cannot handle the heavier material.  </p>
<p>Also, George said the production plant at Fort McMurray does not simply produce &quot;synthetic&quot; crude from oil sands but manufactures lighter products and feedstocks, such as diesel and naphtha, which means it can &quot;custom blend&quot; for refineries to match seasonal requirements.</p>
<p>&quot;We like being an integrated oil company with some balance between upstream and downstream. Integrated companies tend to have higher returns on equity than either pure upstream or downstream companies,&quot; George said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Most of the Canadian producers can't look at downstream as they dont have the technical expertise on this side of the business.&quot;</p>
<p>George notes that Suncor's 80,000 bpd refinery in Sarnia, Ontario, which feeds its retail network accounting for 20 percent of the Ontaria gasoline market, has been profitable for a decade, contributing net cashflow of around C$60 millin a year.</p>
<p>Acquiring retail assets in the U.S. might be part of a longer-term strategy but &quot;it is not our starting point,&quot; George said.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has no current plans to raise any debt or equity in the U.S. Rather, efforts will be concentrated on raising U.S. share ownership from a current 30 percent, up from 12 percent a year ago. A two-for-one share split, to be effective around May 10, will help in the goal of attracting more non-institutional U.S. shareholders, George reckons.</p>
<p>Suncor's NYSE shares closed up 50 cents at $45.50, while the Toronto-listed shares ended at C$63.70, up 95 cents.</p>
