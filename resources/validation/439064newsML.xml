<p>Albanian border police on Thursday engaged Macedonian border guards in a firefight as violence reached Albania's northern borders, prompting Yugoslavia to call for a peaceful settlement of the crisis.</p>
<p>The Yugoslav government, in its first official reaction to the violence in neighbouring Albania, said the &quot;deep destabilisation ... with implications for the stability of the region is causing the federal government's concern,&quot; and called for a peaceful political settlement to the crisis.</p>
<p>Ethnic Albanians account for almost one-fifth of the 10-million population of Serbia which together with tiny Montenegro comprises new Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The firefight, in which no one was injured, occurred when seven Albanian border policemen tried to cross the border at Kjafasan and opened fire at Macedonian border guards, who returned their fire, the Macedonian Defence Ministry said.</p>
<p>After several minutes of gunfire, the Albanian policemen fled, leaving their weapons and equipment behind, the Ministry said. The clash came after the watchtower on the Albanian side was seized by rebel forces, it said.</p>
<p>Macedonia proclaimed its independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991.</p>
<p>The Macedonian Defence Ministry said the security situation along its border with Albania, in the region of the Ohrid and Prespa lakes, was deteriorating rapidly amid fresh reports of gunfire from light and heavy weapons across the border.</p>
<p>Macedonian Radio said there appeared to be complete chaos on that part of the border, with no regular army or police presence and no border controls. The rebels had seized and looted two border watchtowers, it said.</p>
<p>An Albanian officer told the radio station &quot;there is chaos in Peshkopeja and two captured tanks are being driven through the town&quot;. People had looted 40 tonnes of wheat from the state reserves, he said.</p>
<p>Macedonian Radio reported that citizens of the border town Ohrid could hear gunfire from heavy and light artillery and see rockets flying above the lake.</p>
<p>Arms depots in Tirana and several other towns were looted and in the northern city of Shkoder, until now untouched by the rebellion, doctors said five people had died and 50 were wounded when two arms depots were looted.</p>
<p>The mounting chaos had its origins in an anti-government uprising sparked by anger over the collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which many Albanians lost their life savings.</p>
<p>A column of vehicles which crossed onto Yugoslav territory on Thursday included a dozen cars and jeeps with some 50 Catholic priests and nuns from Albania.</p>
<p>They told journalists they were very concerned about the situation and said that &quot;not even during World War Two did monks and nuns leave their monasteries&quot;.</p>
