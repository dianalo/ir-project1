<p>Lord Sterling, chairman of Britain's P&amp;O, said on Thursday that he saw no sign of ferry fares and prices changing on the English Channel despite his company's plan to merge some operations with rival Stena Line.</p>
<p>He told reporters at a news conference to discuss the merger plan there was no sign of any change and added &quot;rates are expected to stay low&quot;.</p>
<p>However, he said the companies' cost reduction plans would probably lead to the loss of at least 1,000 jobs, answering a question, &quot;It would be surprising if it was less than that.&quot;</p>
<p>The firms will take two ships off the channel by year-end.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is an attack on costs, this merger, so we can have adequate profitability in a low-rate environment,&quot; Sterling added.</p>
<p>He said that the short-sea English Channel routes involved in the merger currently employed 3,500 P&amp;O staff and 2,000 Stena staff.  </p>
<p>The cuts are part of a package to slash fixed costs by at least 75 million stg from an initial base of 280 million stg.</p>
<p>Stena's managing director Bo Lerenius said the merger on the three routes was the only possible way to mount an effective offensive against the tunnel, which has so far this year secured a 41 percent stake of passengers travelling these routes, 45 percent of cars and 44 percent of freight.</p>
<p>&quot;We see a joint venture on the short-sea between P&amp;O and Stena as possibly the only way to create a really strong and consistent competitor against the Eurotunnel,&quot; Lerenius told the press conference.  </p>
<p>The ferry operators' market share has come under further threat since May when Eurotunnel slashed car tariffs by up to 50 percent.</p>
<p>Sterling said, given his expectation of continued low rates, P&amp;O Stena Line would ensure its position through lower costs, better service and steady if not improved market share.</p>
<p>&quot;All our calculations have been on the assumption that there will be no (rate) change,&quot; Sterling said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think so much depends on what happens with the tunnel.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be quite ridiculous for us to work on the basis in our forward plans that there would be any price increases at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Sterling said he hoped all final approvals for the merger would be completed early next year before the next summer season, and ahead of Britain's upcoming general election.</p>
