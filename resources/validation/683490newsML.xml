<p>Gloria Jean's Gourmet Coffees, the second-largest specialty coffee retailer in the U.S., said Tuesday it will raise the price of brewed coffee by 10 cents per cup to reflect higher world green coffee prices.</p>
<p>The increase, which takes effect July 6, will raise the price of an eight-ounce cup of coffee to $1.05 and 12-ounce cup to $1.25. The price of a 16-ounce cup of coffee will not change, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Castroville, Calif., company said the price hike at its 260 franchise and corporate-owned stores will be iits first since world coffee prices began to skyrocket.</p>
<p>&quot;Most retailers have already raised prices once, or in some cases twice,&quot; Gloria Jean's president Alton McEwen said in the statement. &quot;Gloria Jean's had locked in the price it pays for most of its coffees prior to world coffee prices increasing, and we let our customers benefit from this favorable position.</p>
<p>&quot;However, with world prices continuing to be much higher than a year ago, Gloria Jean's is now incurring higher prices for some of the very high quality coffee that we sell,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Suggested retail prices will rise an average of $1.00 per lb to $9.99 for blends and varietal coffee beans and $10.99 for flavored coffees, the company said.</p>
<p>Although arabica coffee prices traded on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange have fallen nearly 40 percent since peaking at 20-year highs in May, McEwen said the coffee market, which is facing a shortage of premium coffees used in the specilaty sector, remained volatile and prices were still steep.</p>
<p>&quot;Current prices are double what they were in December, but in late May they were more than triple,&quot; he said. &quot;The reduction from the May high may get reported as coffee prices coming down, although they remain very high relative to the long-term average.&quot;</p>
<p>Gloria Jean's is a subsidiary of Second Cup of Toronto, a leading specialty coffee retailer in Canada.</p>
