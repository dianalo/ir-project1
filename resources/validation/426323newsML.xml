<p>Kazakhstan's national chrome company Kazkhrom, whose main shareholder is Japan Chrome Corp., said on Friday that Kazakh chrome ore mine output plunged 54 percent in 1996 to 1.1 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Kazkhrom President Akzam Bayandarov also told Reuters that Kazkhrom's 1996 output of ferro-alloys, including those of chrome, fell by 23.8 percent to 548,800 tonnes.  </p>
<p>He said the company had been hit by unfavourable international metals prices and fierce competition and losses on world markets in the wake of the bankruptcy of commodities trader AIOC Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;We expected this (losses) to happen, because the presence of a large, integrated company like Kazkhrom on the international market, has, naturally, led to opposition from those firms which started working in this market long ago,&quot; he also said.</p>
<p>Offshore Japan Chrome owns a 55.2 percent stake in Kazkhrom, which groups mines, smelters and other related plants.</p>
<p>Japan Chrome is registered in the British Virgin Islands and industry officials have said London-based Trans-World Group has an interest in Kazkhrom.  </p>
<p>Kazakhstan's chrome ore reserves are estimated to be the second largest in the world, and Kazkhrom groups all of Kazakhstan's chrome mines and plants.</p>
<p>Bayandarov said Kazkhrom ended 1996 with losses of 126 million tenge after profits in 1995 of 8.12 billion tenge, but said he hoped for a turnaround this year.</p>
<p>He said the company was considering shedding ferro-alloy units not integrated with an ore base and that it had broadened its range of alloys.</p>
<p>Kazkhrom suspended chrome ore shipments to Russian ferro-alloy factories from May 1996 but has continued deliveries to Russian chemical plants.</p>
<p>Bayandarov said 250,000 tonnes of chrome ore were exported last year to Russian chemical plants but that ore would be delivered to Russian ferro-alloy plants only if they prepaid.</p>
