<headline>U.S. discusses F-16 sale with other countries.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The United States said on Friday it had begun discussing with other countries the possible purchase of nine U.S.-made F-16 warplanes after Indonesia pulled out of the deal.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns confirmed that Washington had been notified that Indonesia was scrapping plans to buy the planes.</p>
<p>&quot;We had started to talk to other countries, actually, before this formal announcement was made anticipating that the government of Indonesia might get cold feet,&quot; he told a news briefing. He would not identify the countries.</p>
<p>Indonesia hit out at U.S. congressional critics on Friday, dropping its participation in an American military training programme and the F-16 aircraft purchase.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told a news conference he hoped the move would ease friction with the United States to allow cooperation on &quot;the many economic, political and security issues that have to be faced in the years to come.&quot;</p>
<p>He denied there was a link between the move and criticism from the State Department over the conduct of Indonesia's May 29 general election, which the ruling Golkar party won with a sweeping majority.</p>
<p>Jakarta has come under fire from some U.S. senators and congressmen, particularly over its human rights record and East Timor, the former Portuguese colony that Indonesia occupied in 1975 and annexed the following year.</p>
<p>In Washington, Burns said the United States regretted Indonesia's decision.</p>
<p>But, &quot;we intend to continue working with Indonesia and we'll just have to move on,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United States initiated the sale of the F-16s to Indonesia after their original sale to Pakistan was blocked by Congress over Islamabad's nuclear policy.</p>
<p>Pakistan paid $658 million for the planes and has demanded that the issue be resolved in one of four ways. The United States could deliver the aircraft, refund the money or sell the planes to a third country. The fourth option, mentioned by Pakistan's foreign minister in a recent trip to Washington, is litigation in U.S. courts.</p>
<p>Washington has had a difficult time finding buyers for the planes. Burns said with Indonesia's decision &quot;we'll have to redouble our efforts to look for other countries.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is an excellent aircraft ... American aircraft are the best in the world ... And we think there will be no shortage of potential buyers. We are talking to some countries, but I can't talk about those negotiations until they move further along,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chile is among the countries in the world known to be actively interested in buying advanced aircraft.</p>
<p>The United States currently has a policy of restraint in selling advanced systems to Latin America but that has been under review for the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Burns said President Bill Clinton still has not made a final decision on the policy review. But several weeks ago, Clinton agreed to let American companies make available to Chile technical information on U.S.-made fighters so that the American firms would not be at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p>Burns denied that by allowing U.S. firms to participate in the bidding process, the administration had effectively made a decision to let the sale of advanced systems go forward.</p>
<p>The United States barred Indonesia from participating in the military training programme called IMET in 1992 after security forces fired into demonstrating mourners in the East Timor capital of Dili in 1991. Witnesses said up to 200 people died. The programme allows senior officers to be trained in the United States.</p>
<p>In late 1995, Washington reinstated Indonesia's participation in the programme, which covers about 20 senior officers annually at a cost of $600,000.</p>
