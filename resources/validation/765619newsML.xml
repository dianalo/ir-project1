<p>The Zimbabwe dollar closed little changed from Tuesday's levels against the key U.S. dollar on Wednesday but dealers said import pressure still lurked in the background with room for a further depreciation.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a rather quiet day today but there's still fundamentally a shortage (of foreign currency) in the market,&quot; commented one dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw one bank that was really short bidding as high as 11.6300 for U.S. dollars,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He and other dealers said they had not seen any evidence of intervention from the central Reserve Bank to prop up the local currency during the day.</p>
<p>&quot;If the central bank is doing anything then it's very little...they are saying the market should correct itself,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>The dealers say it is up to the central bank to bring back stability to the local currency whose free-fall, triggered off last Wednesday by a large import payment, was worsened by central bank governor Leonard Tsumba's statement on Friday that the unit was overvalued.</p>
<p>The Zimbabwe dollar ended the day at 11.5500/6500 on the U.S. dollar, little-changed from 11.5500/7500 the previous day, but was quoted easier on sterling at 18.8700/19.0450 compared to 18.7600/19.1100.</p>
<p>It was however quoted firmer on the mark at 6.2700/3260 against 6.3100/4200 but was down at 2.5475/5505 from 2.5200/5600 against South Africa's rand.</p>
