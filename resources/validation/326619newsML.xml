<p>Indonesian mining company PT Tambang Timah has submitted a proposal seeking a five to 20 percent stake in the huge Busang gold find in East Kalimantan, local newspapers reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The minimal stake we are capable of taking in Busang is five percent. The maximum stake is 20 percent,&quot; Timah president director Erry Riyana was quoted as saying by Bisnis Indonesia.</p>
<p>Timah officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Erry said the proposed five-to-20 percent stakeholding was in line with the state-controlled company's financial situation and sugestions by members of parliament.</p>
<p>Bisnis quoted Erry as saying the proposal was being studied by the Mines and Energy Ministry.</p>
<p>The Neraca daily quoted Erry as saying that Timah, which is also listed in London, was confident of financing its equity in Busang through facilities such as offshore syndicated loans.</p>
<p>Erry said if the Mines and Energy Ministry approved its proposal, the firm would seek the go ahead from the Finance Ministry, which has a 65-percent stake in Timah, and other shareholders at a meeting on February 27 before taking further action.</p>
<p>The government has given Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd and Barrick Gold Corp one month from January 17 to settle with their local partners before they get the green light to jointly develop the find.</p>
<p>Bre-X estimates the property to contain at least 57 million ounces of gold worth over $21 billion at current prices.</p>
