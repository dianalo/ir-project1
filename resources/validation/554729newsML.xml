<p>Professional services organization Andersen Worldwide said on Thursday its partners voted by 93 percent to keep the global organization together.</p>
<p>The decision was made during the firm's annual meeting this week in Paris, Andersen said.</p>
<p>&quot;The partners of Andersen Worldwide made this decision in the best interests of our clients as well as our organization,&quot; Lawrence Weinbach, managing partner-chief executive said. &quot;We intend to serve the global market of the 21st century with the best network of any global professional services organization.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Andersen group covers the Arthur Andersen accounting and audit practice and Andersen Consulting, which specializes in strategic advisory work.</p>
<p>The 2,700 partners met in Paris hoping to resolve problems stemming from the rapid growth of Andersen Consulting and tensions between the two Andersen businesses.</p>
<p>The rise of the consulting side since it set up as a separate unit in 1989 has fuelled demands for a reorganization which reflects its wealth and importance within the group.</p>
<p>In a statement, Andersen Worldwide said strong double-digit growth in both the Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting business units was expected to drive total revenues past $11 billion during the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>The group posted $9.5 billion in revenues in 1996.</p>
<p>But the partners said they acknowledged that the tremendous, continuing pace of growth resulted in the need for some organizational adjustments in order to best serve the market in the future.</p>
<p>They said they believed discussions at the Paris meeting, which culminated an 18-month strategic planning process, would provide valuable input on several issues to incoming leadership.</p>
<p>The firm's representative in New York was not immediately available to comment further.</p>
<p>Andersen also said it had started the process of choosing a successor for Weinbach, who previously announced his intention not to seek a third term. It said this process would likely be completed in May.</p>
