<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine bonds fall in thin market activity.</title>

<p>Argentine bonds fell in thin volumes Friday as the market finally succumbed to a bout of profit-taking after its recent gains.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices are adjusting slowly which is healthy for the market but the profit-taking took place amid very thin volumes so there was no big fall-out,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Argentina's FRB Brady bond due 2005 fell 1/4 to 91-1/2, while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 was flat at 126.50.</p>
<p>&quot;The thin volumes meant the price action was not very indicative&quot; of the market general trend, said another trader.  </p>
<p>Trade was subdued by the early closure of the U.S. Treasuries market for the Presidents Day holiday on Monday, when activity was seen remaining thin.</p>
<p>Players said the market's next big point of focus was Tuesday's auction of $500 million Bonte Treasury bonds. The sale will expand the size of the two-year Bonte first issued in December to a total of $1.0 billion.</p>
<p>In the money markets, call money rates rose to 6.53 percent from 6.48 percent.</p>
