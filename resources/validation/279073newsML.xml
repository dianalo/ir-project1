<title>SOUTH KOREA: Pyongyang apology over submarine seen imminent.</title>

<text>
<p>Hopes were rising in South Korea on Saturday that a North Korean apology over the incursion of a submarine was imminent, a move that would ease military tensions on the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>The South Korean Yonhap news agency quoted an unnamed Seoul official as saying an agreement &quot;in principal&quot; on an apology had been reached during meetings in New York between North Korean and U.S. diplomats.</p>
<p>A final accord would be reached on Sunday, the official was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>South Korean state radio added to expectations of a breakthrough in a row that has frozen inter-Korean relations and threatened a key nuclear accord.</p>
<p>It quoted diplomatic sources in Washington as saying Pyongyang was ready to express regret for the incursion of the submarine in September which landed 26 heavily armed North Koreans on an east coast beach.</p>
<p>South Korea has demanded an apology as the price of resuming aid to the North and implementing a 1994 agreement between Washington and Pyongyang under which it will supply nuclear reactors to North Korea.</p>
<p>&quot;A diplomatic source in Washington said North Korea has agreed to officially apologise for the submarine incursion with a statement by a foreign ministry spokesman and is holding negotiations on final details of the statement in New York,&quot; the radio said.</p>
<p>A South Korean foreign ministry official said Seoul had received no official apology yet.</p>
<p>&quot;We are waiting to see what happens,&quot; said the official, who declined to be named. He added that there would be a media briefing on Sunday at 10 a.m. (0100 GMT) on the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;The official said he understands the apology would contain their admission of the violation of South Korean waters by the submarine, regret over the casualties caused by the incident, and remarks that both sides should make common efforts to promote peace on the Korean peninsula,&quot; Yonhap said.</p>
<p>Twenty-four of the intruders were shot and killed, one was captured alive and one is still on the loose. The agents killed several South Korean soldiers in shootouts and murdered civilians while dodging a massive dragnet.</p>
<p>Yonhap said the apology was expected to be issued through North Korean state media. Once it was made, South Korea would return the remains of the North Korean submarine crew.</p>
<p>In meetings with North Korean diplomats in New York, U.S. envoys have urged Pyongyang to make a statement that would satisfy the South.</p>
<p>The North Korean side in the talks is led by Li Hyong Chol, director of American affairs in Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry. Mark Minton, director of the State Department's office of Korean affairs, has been leading the U.S. side.</p>
<p>Resolving the submarine crisis would clear the way for progress on four-party talks proposed by the United States and South Korea with the North and China on a lasting peace to replace the truce that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
<p>It would also allow further discussion on opening a U.S. diplomatic liaison office in Pyongyang, which has been bogged down over technical details.</p>
<p>Under the 1994 deal, North Korea abandoned its suspected nuclear weapons programme in exchange for safer nuclear reactors and shipments of fuel oil.</p>
<p>South Korea refuses to send technicians to the North to undertake crucial site inspection work for the reactors until it receives an apology.</p>
