<p>Paraguay's central bank chief draws a rough sketch of a soccer game in pandemonium to illustrate the chaos in the country's banking system.</p>
<p>&quot;There were players who wouldn't play by the rules, there were no offsides and no penalties,&quot; bank president Hermes Gomez Ginard said in an interview.</p>
<p>The description, rare for central bank chiefs who usually speak in obscure monetary jargon, is a metaphor for fraud, mismanagement and weak regulation.</p>
<p>They have combined to produce a crisis that many predict will end in a sharp consolidation of the financial services market in this landlocked nation of five million, notorious for smuggling and money-laundering.</p>
<p>It also has created a political crisis for the government of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who is under pressure from even his own ruling Colorado party to assume responsibility for the financial mess and ditch his economic cabinet.</p>
<p>Severe liquidity problems were highlighted by a recent government decision to take control of three institutions.</p>
<p>At issue is not that it took over Banco Union, Paraguay's largest bank with $190 million in deposits, Ahorros Paraguayos, a savings and loans firm linked to Union, and Banco Inversiones.</p>
<p>Rather, officials are under fire for taking so long.</p>
<p>CLUES EMERGED MUCH EARLIER</p>
<p>It has come to light that the authorities knew as early as two years ago of irregularities in the institutions.</p>
<p>In the case of Banco Union, officials chose to let executives draft a restructuring plan to try to save the bank.</p>
<p>But on June 16, the central bank took over all three institutions amid allegations that executives siphoned off some of the funds the state lent them.</p>
<p>Union was controlled by the family of Industry Minister Ubaldo Scavone. He quit late last month for &quot;ethical reasons&quot; after being accused of covering up its financial problems.</p>
<p>Another member of the economic team, Agriculture Minister Juan Borgognon, resigned for &quot;health reasons&quot; a week later.</p>
<p>A judge charged several Union executives, including Francisco Scavone, the former minister's brother, froze their bank accounts, and ordered them jailed.</p>
<p>The effects are potentially far-reaching. About 90 percent of industrial firms had their deposits in Union, according to the president of the industrial chamber, Arturo Jara Avelli. The fate of the three institutions remains unclear.</p>
<p>The problems ironically may be traced to the restoration of democracy after a coup that overthrew General Alfredo Stroessner's 36-year dictatorship in 1989.</p>
<p>A PLETHORA OF BANKS EMERGES, BANKING RULES IGNORED</p>
<p>After the coup, the banking system saw the emergence of dozens of small institutions operating with low capital and few rules.</p>
<p>Over an 18-month period starting in January 1995, the authorities closed four banks and 13 savings and loans and spent about $300 million to pay back depositors.</p>
<p>But there still remain 28 banks, nine of them local, and 52 savings and loans to handle only $2 billion in private deposits.</p>
<p>In nearby Chile, by comparison, 29 banks, 12 of them local, and three savings and loans hold $34 billion in deposits.</p>
<p>Investigations have found that executives lent money to other firms they held, to their own familiies and to finance political campaigns. These loans were often not repaid.</p>
<p>Daniel Fretes Ventre, who as Controller General monitors state spending, criticises the central bank in the Union case, saying he made fruitless requests for information on its activities 10 times between September 1996 and June 1997 as funds were suspiciously leaving the country.</p>
<p>Ahorros Paraguayos, he said in an interview, kept two books, one of them for &quot;unregistered&quot; funds suspected to be from contraband.</p>
<p>The central bank chief Gomez Ginard took over in late 1995 and implemented tougher penalties at the end of last year.</p>
<p>&quot;We started to apply the rules,&quot; he said. &quot;Many got angry. They wanted to play as they did before. We got the worst players off the field. We had to leave some on to play the game.&quot;</p>
<p>RESERVE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED</p>
<p>Now, banks are banned from lending to sister firms. There were no reserve requirements before, and some institutions had no capital on hand at all. But now institutions must keep 10 percent of their deposits on reserve.</p>
<p>There are also tighter restrictions for giving &quot;call&quot; money to banks to help tide them over with short-term needs.</p>
<p>The central bank is committed by law to guaranteeing deposits up to $2,300. Around 50 percent of depositors had more than that in Banco Union.</p>
<p>An opposition bill now in Congress would guarantee 100 percent of deposits on checking accounts and quintuple the guarantee on savings accounts to $11,500. It has been passed by the lower house and awaits Senate approval.</p>
<p>Gomez Ginard said no other institutions warrant state intervention. However, he added, &quot;There are too many players.&quot;</p>
<p>Economist Luis Campos of the private LAC consultants said there are twice the number of institutions needed, given the size of Paraguay's financial market.</p>
<p>&quot;There has to be a shrinking of the industry, so those remaining can better compete,&quot; said Campos.</p>
