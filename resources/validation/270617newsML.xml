<p>J.P. Morgan on Friday posted a bullish outlook for European equity markets in 1997, forecasting up to 20 percent growth and betting on Spain being among the first nations to join European Monetary Union (EMU).</p>
<p>&quot;Lower than expected interest rates and our forecast of strong growth through 1997 and 1998 makes us positive about European equity markets for 1997,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We are forecasting returns of 10 to 20 percent, which we believe to be cautious.&quot;</p>
<p>It added that its targets could be upgraded if its economic growth outlook was confirmed by a strong second quarter growth rebound.</p>
<p>JP Morgan said it had reduced its weighting in Italy from overweight to neutral so as to strengthen its exposure to Spain on the expectation of Spain joining EMU in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;We have reinforced our weighting in Spain in the expectation of stronger growth and a good chance that Spain will enter EMU in the first round,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are financing a higher weighting in Spain by cutting our weighting in Italy to neutral,&quot; it said, adding the peripheral markets would experience high volatility during 1997.</p>
<p>A J.P. Morgan official said Italy's poor GDP growth rate would undermine its attempt to make significant progress towards Maastrict next year.</p>
<p>It is forecasting 1.1 pct GDP growth for Italy in 1997 against 3.2 percent in Spain and a European average of 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>JP Morgan said it would retain its core underweighting of France against an overweighting of Germany since Germany was likely to offer both growth and corporate restructuring.</p>
<p>Restructuring was set to remain a major feature of the European corporate landscape during 1997, with significant dividend increases a possible surprise as companies return excess cash to shareholders.</p>
<p>Sector selection would follow three themes -- buying into the growth rebound through cyclicals; slowly accumulating consumer stocks; and gaining exposure to restructuring or its payoff, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our key 'Buy' recommendations are AGF, BASF, Danone, Elf Aquitaine, Metro and Norsk Hydro,&quot; it added.</p>
