<p>Mexico's Energy Ministry plans to invest 68.697 billion pesos in 1997 energy projects, ministry officials told federal deputies in a budget presentation Monday.</p>
<p>Energy Deputy Minister Javier Casas Guzman presented the budget proposal for Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the state-owned oil and gas monopoly, and other electricity projects.  </p>
<p>&quot;The energy sector will comprise in 1997 the principal investment activity in the public sector, absorbing 55.8 percent of total resources assigned to investment,&quot; Casas said in a ministry statement.</p>
<p>Mexico plans to privatize its petrochemical plants, offering full private participation in new plants and minority ownership of existing plants.</p>
<p>Energy Minister Jesus Reyes Heroles has said private companies should be able to invest in the plants by the beginning of 1997, although companies say the scheme for privatization has yet to be defined.  </p>
<p>Energy sector spending for 1997 will be 57.8 percent higher than 1996 spending, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Casas said the major projects planned by Pemex, under the jurisdiction of the ministry, will total 89.993 billion pesos, 18.3 percent of which is scheduled to be spent in 1997.</p>
<p>Pemex is planning to work on the Cantarell oil field to optimize crude production, erecting 120 oil perforation wells and 24 wells for secondary oil recovery over the next four years, Casas said.  </p>
<p>He elaborated on plans to break bottlenecks that limit offshore light crude production, saying the work on nine oil fields will require a 3.89 million peso investment in 1997.</p>
<p>The third project involves boosting natural gas production at the Tamaulipas state Burgos Basin through exploration in the region. The price tag for the venture will total 1.198 billion pesos, Casas said.</p>
<p>Investment plans for the Cadereyta refinery include 3.225 billion pesos in 1997 to build 10 processing plants. The project should reduce supply of heavy fuels, and boost production of light, higher quality fuels, Casas said.  </p>
<p>Noting Mexico's growing electricity demand, Casas said supply needs will require new generation projects to secure future electricity supply throughout the country.</p>
<p>&quot;In this respect, the updated perspective for the electricity sector considers in the period from 1996 to 2005 an additional generation capacity of 12,530 megawatts should be incorporated, of which 2,764 megawatts corresponds to projects already in the works, and 9,766 megawatts are new projects,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Total 1997 budgeted spending in the electricity sector will be 18.535 billion pesos, a 61.7 percent increase from 1996. The 1997 total will partly be spent on Federal Electricity Commission generation and distribution projects.</p>
