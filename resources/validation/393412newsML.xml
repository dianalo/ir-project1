<p>The key prosecution witness in the match-rigging trial of soccer star Bruce Grobbelaar was so unreliable he couldn't be trusted to give &quot;directions to the toilet,&quot; a defence lawyer said on Friday.</p>
<p>The prosecution case hangs heavily on the evidence of Chris Vincent, once a business partner of former Liverpool goalkeeper Grobbelaar who is charged with accepting bribes to throw soccer matches in Britain's premier league.</p>
<p>But the lawyer of one of Grobbelaar's co-defendants, Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim, said Vincent could not be trusted.</p>
<p>Vincent was &quot;a man so consumed by hate and money, you wouldn't have believed him if he gave you directions to the toilet unless you paid him first,&quot; said Jerome Lynch.</p>
<p>Vincent helped a tabloid newspaper secretly record Grobbelaar accepting 2,000 pounds ($3,200), allegedly as a bribe to rig a match.</p>
<p>The video also showed Grobbelaar telling Vincent that he had lost 125,000 pounds by accidentally making &quot;two blinding saves&quot; in a game he was being paid to lose.</p>
<p>Grobbelaar claimed during the six-week trial that he had accepted the money from Vincent because he wanted to expose the supposed corruption to police. He had made up the story about losing the 125,000 pounds to lead Vincent on, he said.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe-born Grobbelaar is on trial with Lim and two other soccer stars, former Wimbledon keeper Hans Segers and former Wimbledon and Aston Villa striker John Fashanu.</p>
<p>The prosecution alleges that they were involved in throwing games for a wealthy Asian gambling ring.</p>
<p>Lynch asked the jury to consider what the three soccer players had to gain from rigging matches.</p>
<p>&quot;You must ask yourselves whether these men would risk everything that they hold dear...their families would be risked, the ignominy of it all, their money, their liberty.&quot;</p>
<p>And would Lim, a football fanatic who came to Britain in 1988, have dared to approach such big soccer stars to ask them to fix games, Lynch asked the jury to consider.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you broach this subject in the first place with a national hero?</p>
<p>&quot;How do you go up to John Fashanu and say, I want you to be Mr Fix-it for me', how do you do that?</p>
<p>&quot;How do you go up to Bruce Grobbelaar, who has played 700 times for his club and country, how do you approach him, how do you get there?&quot; ($1.00 = 0.619 British Pounds)</p>
