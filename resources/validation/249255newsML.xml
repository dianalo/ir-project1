<p>Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce on Wednesday completed a $60-million capital increase through the first simultaneous local and international share offering by a Lebanese issuer.</p>
<p>BLC said two-thirds of the increase -- which doubles its capital -- came from an issue of Global Depositary Receipts to investors worldwide and one-third from a domestic offering of shares to regional investors.</p>
<p>&quot;This landmark issue of shares and GDRs represents the first simultaneous domestic and international offering by a Lebanese issuer,&quot; BLC said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The transaction was 3.5 times oversubscribed, the highest level of oversubscription for a Lebanese equity issue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are extremely proud that this issue has succeeded in raising awareness with international investors of the Middle East region and of Lebanon in particular,&quot; Jean Aboujaoude, Chief Financial Officer at BLC, said.</p>
<p>The GDRs were priced at $11.8 each with orders from over 75 international institutions. The shares were priced at a five percent discount to the GDRs, or $11.2 each, and were placed with high quality regional investors, BLC said.</p>
<p>More than 40 percent of the GDRs were placed in the United States, 30 percent with U.K. institutional investors while investors in Asia and Continental Europe split the rest equally.</p>
<p>The GDR issue was the second by a Lebanese bank following Banque Audi's $34 million issue in October 1995.</p>
<p>BLC said the GDRs would be listed in Luxembourg and the shares will be listed on the Beirut Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>It plans to become the first company to launch an Initial Price Offering (IPO) on the Beirut Stock Exchange since it reopened in January after a 13-year shutdown. The shares will be the first bank listing on the exchange.</p>
<p>Coupled with the expected listing of two other Beirut banks soon, this will give the lacklustre bourse a much-needed boost.</p>
<p>A Beirut bourse official told Reuters the market was still waiting for a few documents from BLC &quot;but in principle they will be listed at the start of January.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very important because of the lack of products on the exchange and bank shares will be well received,&quot; he said, adding Banque Audi was also expected to be listed and traded very soon.</p>
<p>A law passed earlier this year allows Lebanese banks to list 30 percent of their shares on the exchange and trading can take place without prior permission from the central bank.</p>
<p>BLC said Nomura International was global co-ordinator for the capital increase and lead-managed the GDR issue. Beirut-based Middle East Capital Group (MECG) was lead manager for the domestic offering and co-manager of the international offering.</p>
<p>The capital increase will involve BLC's acquisition of BLC France, its Paris subsidiary that split from the parent bank during the 1975-90 civil war, and its four branches in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>BLC is Lebanon's oldest bank and was established in 1950. It operates the second largest branch network of any privately owned bank in the country and ranked 13th among Lebanon's 82 banks in total assets and customer deposits in 1995.</p>
<p>BLC was 97.4 percent owned by the Aboujaoude family, whose shareholding will fall to 55.6 percent after the capital increase.</p>
