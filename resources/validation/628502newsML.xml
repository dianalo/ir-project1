<p>The unbeaten Auckland Blues won a close-run Super 12 final by overpowering the ACT Brumbies from Canberra, Australia, by 23-7 on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Blues, defending title holders of the tri-nation championship, got the edge at their Eden Park home ground through a forward pack led by outstanding captain Zinzan Brooke.</p>
<p>Difficult conditions on a ground drenched by rain frustrated the Brumbies' back line as they tried unsuccesfully to outsmart the New Zealand favourites headed by the All Black front row.</p>
<p>In an unlucky accident the game lost both its star players late in the second half when Brumbies' sparkling scrum half George Gregan clashed heads with the giant Brooke.</p>
<p>Gregan left the field on a stretcher while the Auckland leader and number eight staggered off to be checked for possible concussion. Both were cleared fit in due course.</p>
<p>The Blues won a long waiting game to secure the first score -- a try after 28 minutes -- that turned the match their way.</p>
<p>It followed seven pounding minutes, and as many scrums, within five metres of the ACT goal line. Brooke finally broke the deadlock to smash through the defence and get the ball to prop Craig Dowd who scored. Although key Brumbie backs like Gregan and Stephen Larkham started up trademark clever moves they were shut out for the bulk of the game by a wet ball and hard Auckland defending.</p>
<p>The home team were 10-0 up by halftime after an Adrian Cashmore penalty kick, and his penalty kicks continued to build points into the second half with two more in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>When Michael Jones intercepted a flat pass across the ACT back line and ran in a classic try, the home team seemed to have it sealed. Another Cashmore conversion took the score to 23-0.</p>
<p>Auckland were ground down in defence late in the game, letting in Joe Roff in the 65th minute with a super solo run for a try he then converted instead of regular kicker David Knox.</p>
<p>But that was the best the visitors could manage and both drained teams slugged it out to the end with no further score.</p>
<p>The win was Auckland's 15th in a row in Super 12.  </p>
<p>With a team list reading like a roll of honour from international rugby, the Blues were always likely victors.</p>
<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger, in a brief address on the pitch, told Auckland, &quot;You have proved yet again that you are the finest provincial rugby team in the world&quot;.</p>
<p>Apart from some dazed heads the game passed off with few injuries, reflecting the high quality of play by the finalists.</p>
<p>Blues coach Graham Henry called it &quot;a very hard game of rugby&quot;, telling reporters his side, &quot;played superbly, especially that second half when they kept grinding away&quot;.</p>
<p>The slow start was a result of the greasy conditions, he said, but the Blues' scoring power won the day.</p>
<p>Henry also paid tribute to the Brumbies, now regarded as the standard-bearers of Australian rugby under their astute coach Rod Macqueen after coming from virtually nowhere in two years.</p>
<p>Their captain Brett Robinson put part of his team's defeat down to lack of control of the ball, and noted they had deliberately put a lot of energy into defending.</p>
<p>&quot;We really concentrated on our defence over the last five or six weeks -- it was a big part of our game -- but unfortunately we let ourselves down at a couple of very vital times,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Prop Ewen McKenzie admitted the ACT pack was heavily taxed by the Blues crucial period of scrum-based attack in the first half that led to Auckland's breakthrough try.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing worse for a front row than having to defend your line from a series of scrums like that..I think it was a measure of their confidence that they could do that,&quot; he said.</p>
