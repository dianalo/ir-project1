<title>USA: NationsBank defends lending record.</title>

<p>NationsBank Corp defended its lending record on Monday after a community activist group opposing the bank's acquisition of Boatmen's Bancshares Inc threatened to block the deal in court.</p>
<p>&quot;NationsBank has a very strong community investment record and a record of results,&quot; said Pam McQuitty, a spokeswoman for the bank said.</p>
<p>Her remarks followed an announcement by Inner City Press/Community on the Move that it would try to stop the deal. The group has expressed concern that the merged companies would leave low-income neghborhoods underserved.  </p>
<p>Earlier, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board unanimously approved the merger, ruling that the lending records of both companies &quot;were consistent with&quot; approval.</p>
<p>McQuitty said NationsBank had a solid record in community investment lending for home mortgages, loans to small businesses and various equity investments -- all in low- to moderate-income areas.</p>
<p>Charlotte, N.C.-based NationsBank is the fifth-largest bank in the United States and the premier banking power in the Southeast, controlling assets of about $192.3 billion.  </p>
<p>St. Louis-based Boatmen's is the 24th-largest U.S. bank with assets of $40.7 billion.</p>
<p>The deal, worth $9 billion, would extend NationsBank's reach into the U.S. heartland and make it No. 4 nationwide.</p>
<p>As recently as last week, Inner City Press/Community on the Move claimed NationsBank's consumer finance unit charged &quot;predatory&quot; interest rates up to 20 percent &quot;disproportionately to people of color.&quot;</p>
<p>The members of the group, which includes minority contractors, also picketed outside the New York Stock Exchange last month to demonstrate opposition to the proposed merger. It wanted NationsBank to make commitments to minority businesses as a condition of approval.</p>
<p>NationsBank and Boatmen's announced the merger in August. They are seeking to complete the transaction in January.</p>
<p>NationsBank ended down 1-1/8 at 92-1/4 in trading on the NYSE. Boatmen's closed down 9/16 at 60-1/16 on the Nasdaq.</p>
