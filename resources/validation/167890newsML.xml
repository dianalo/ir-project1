<title>AUSTRALIA: Ex-judge commits suicide after paedophile comment.</title>
<headline>Ex-judge commits suicide after paedophile comment.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-11-05</dateline>

<p>A former Australian supreme court judge gassed himself to death in his car in Sydney on Monday after being named in parliament in relation to an official inquiry into paedophilia, police said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>David Yeldham, 67, was found dead in a car in the carport of his home at Hunters Hill, an affluent northern Sydney suburb, a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, a politician asked the New South Wales state parliament if Yeldham had been part of informal investigations by an official inquiry now underway in Sydney.</p>
<p>The inquiry's brief is police corruption but it has broadened into investigating paedophilia after claims corrupt police had protected influential paedophiles for many years.</p>
<p>Under parliamentary privilege, Franca Arena said she was not &quot;insinuating anything&quot; about the former judge, but that such informal investigations were preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Yeldham, a judge of the New South Wales Supreme Court from 1974 to 1990, issued a statement at the time denying he was a pederast and said he had not appeared before the inquiry.</p>
<p>&quot;I hate paedophilia. I always have. I've never been one. I never will be one,&quot; Yeldham said in the statement.</p>
<p>Australian media in recent months have reported that a paedophile ring existed involving some of Sydney's social elite, including judges. No evidence has been given to the inquiry to support the media reports.</p>
<p>Yeldham's death sparked an immediate debate on parliamentary privilege, which protects a politician's comments in parliament from legal action.</p>
<p>New South Wales opposition Liberal Party leader Peter Collins said the paedophile rumours had cost Yeldham his life.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that she (Arena) chose the parliament means that a life, in this case, has been lost,&quot; Collins told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;If she had any evidence, if she had any rumour, any innuendo, then the place for that was the royal commission rather than the parliament,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Yeldham's brother Peter on Tuesday called for an end to parliamentary privilege. &quot;It's time this naming of people who have no defence in parliament is stopped,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>New South Wales state Labor premier Bob Carr, in London, warned politicians must be careful how they use parliamentary privilege, but cautioned against denying them such a right.</p>
<p>But Arena, a Labor politician, said she had no regrets about her actions. &quot;The judge made his own decision,&quot; Arena said. &quot;He was a judge...he should have had enough faith in the legal system to clear his name.&quot;</p>
