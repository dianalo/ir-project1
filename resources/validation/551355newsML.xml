<p>Schuler Homes Inc, reporting lower first quarter earnings Wednesday, cited a soft Hawaiian housing market and said it sees continued variability in sales and earnings.</p>
<p>First quarter sales of residential real estate were $50.0 million, more than double the $20.0 million reported for the year-ago period. Operating income rose to $2.2 million from $1.4 million, but net income was $777,000, or $0.04 per share, down from $948,000, or $0.05 per share, a year earlier.  </p>
<p>During the quarter, the company said, it closed the sales of 240 homes and lots, including 167 homes in Colorado and 73 homes and lots in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Backlog at March 31 totaled 468 homes and lots with an aggregate sales value of $78.9 million, compared to $48.4 million in aggregate sales value of 200 homes and lots in backlog a year earlier.</p>
<p>The increase in backlog was due solely to strong sales activity in the Denver division, offset in part by lower backlog in Hawaii, Schuler said.  </p>
<p>&quot;While Hawaii's new home market remains soft, we are encouraged by the positive impact to the company's financial results of our recent entrance to the Colorado market through the acquisition of Melody,&quot; President James Schuler said.</p>
<p>On January 8 the company announced the completion of its acquisition of Melody Homes Inc, a homebuilder in the Denver metropolitan area, and Melody Mortgage Co.</p>
<p>Schuler said, &quot;Melody's first quarter 1997 results are indicative of Colorado's strong housing market ... During the first quarter of 1997, we also continued to pursue land purchase opportunities for our start-ups in the Northern California and Pacific Northwest divisions, and have started construction on model complexes for the first projects in each of these two new markets.&quot;</p>
<p>The company said it has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, significant variability in sales and net income.</p>
