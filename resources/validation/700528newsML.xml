<p>South Korea and the United States on Tuesday hailed North Korea's acceptance of four-nation peace talks but immediately braced themselves for a long process of negotiations before any major breakthrough.</p>
<p>North Korea watchers said the famine-threatened North was in such desperate straits that it was seeking aid from South Korea, which it had earlier branded as &quot;a U.S. puppet&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The government of the Republic of Korea welcomes that the DPRK (North Korea) ... has accepted the proposal for the four-party talks,&quot; Seoul Foreign Ministry spokesman Lee Kyu-hyung said in a statement.</p>
<p>Communist North Korea formally agreed on Monday to a meeting on August 5 of senior officials from the two Koreas, the United States and China to set an agenda and other procedural details for peace talks.</p>
<p>The North, with its economy in ruins, has previously linked its participation to a specific commitment on food aid and an end to U.S. trade sanctions. Seoul and Washington maintain such assistance could be discussed during the talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We're very pleased with this agreement and we look forward to having this go forward,&quot; Deputy U.S. National Security Adviser James Steinberg said in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Steinberg was accompanying Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at ceremonies in Hong Kong marking the July 1 transfer of the territory from British to Chinese control.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said in Tokyo that he hoped the peace talks would be held &quot;at the earliest possible time&quot;.</p>
<p>Kwak Tae-hwan, director of the private Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said it was time for Washington and Seoul to offer concessions to Pyongyang to encourage compromises.</p>
<p>&quot;North Korea is changing a lot these days because of its dire food problem,&quot; he said. &quot;This could bring about a turning point for peace in Korea if more flexiblity is allowed.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. and South Korean officials said engagement by reclusive Pyongyang in serious negotiations to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula would contribute to security in Asia.</p>
<p>But they cautioned against expectations of quick results.</p>
<p>&quot;The four-party talks proposal intends to initiate the process of establishing a permanent peace on the Korean peninsula, including replacement of the current armistice agreement with a new regime,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>The 1953 ceasefire pact ended fighting but did not technically end the three-year Korean War, which pitted the North, backed by China, against the South, supported by the U.S.-led United Nations.</p>
<p>Park Sung-hoon, senior analyst on the North at Seoul's unification ministry said Pyongyang's main purpose was to get Washington to take steps to promote investment in the North.</p>
<p>&quot;The North has insisted the four-nation talks be held in New York where they keep their experts on the U.S.,&quot; Park said. &quot;A North Korean delegation would probably seek bilateral talks with the U.S. whenever they visit New York for the peace talks.&quot;</p>
<p>Lee said Seoul did not expect to achieve detente with the North soon. &quot;It is important to keep North Korea engaged in dialogue and take gradual steps to build up confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>Steinberg told reporters in Hong Kong that getting the Stalinist North to the bargaining table had been a lengthy process with many false starts. The four-nation talks were proposed by Washington and Seoul more than a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;But we take it one step at a time because it's been something that we've recognised all along ... is (a) difficult road to go forward and we hope finally this will represent a serious engagement on the four-party process,&quot; he said.</p>
