<p>Yen-based Tokyo precious metals futures ended lower on Tuesday led by falls in platinum futures and pressured by the yen's firmer tendency against the dollar, traders said.</p>
<p>Volume was moderate.</p>
<p>July platinum tumbled by its 50 yen per gram daily limit by the close. Other platinum futures ranged from one yen to 24 yen per gram lower. Benchmark April ended off one yen at 1,367 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;Following weaker spot platinum prices, private investors liquidated their longs,&quot; an analyst at a commodity broker said.  </p>
<p>Trading in platinum futures was mainly driven by technical factors amid a lack of fresh factors.</p>
<p>&quot;The July/April platinum backwardation will continue to see a gradual correction,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Losses in palladium were limited as private investors took advantage of any dips in prices to cover their short positions.</p>
<p>Tightness in the physical market also prevented prices from falling sharply. Benchmark April palladium closed down three yen at 567 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;The downside in palladium may be limited until Russian metals start flowing into the market,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Some Japanese traders who have signed long-term supply contracts with Russia, expressed concern over whether PGM deliveries from Russia would arrive as scheduled.</p>
<p>In gold futures, private investors were on the selling side, while Japanese traders sold spot gold in arbitrage dealings. Gold futures ranged from four yen to 10 yen per gram lower. Benchmark April was off seven yen at 1,236 yen.</p>
<p>Spot gold was quoted at $341.90/342.40 per ounce at 0745 GMT, against $342.40/90 in New York on Monday.</p>
<p>Benchmark April silver was 0.5 yen per 10 grams easier at 173.8 yen. --Tokyo Commodities Desk, +81-3-3432-7431</p>
