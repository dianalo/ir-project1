<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities fell in line with Treasuries on Tuesday, but pass-through yield spreads narrowed slightly, traders said.</p>
<p>Retail buying in pass-throughs is expected to keep spreads tighter as the market braces for the second leg of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony Wednesday, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mortgage (prices) are going down with Treasuries, and Treasuries are going down because of fear of what (Greenspan) is going to say,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Anytime the (Treasury) market trades off, we'll be in doing some buying,&quot; he said, adding that his firm had bought mortgage paper in a wide range of maturities.</p>
<p>By late afternoon, mortgages had slipped 1/32 to 7/32 overall, while comparable Treasuries were down 5/32 to 7/32.</p>
<p>In key coupons, Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5-percent paper had fallen 5/32, yielding 105 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note. Comparable Fannie Mae paper was 5/32 lower at 99-18/32, and Freddie Mac issues were off 6/32 at 99-23/32.</p>
<p>The 10-year Treasury note was off 7/32 at 97-15/32 to yield 6.60 percent.</p>
