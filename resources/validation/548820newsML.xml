<p>Waves of blue-chips selling smashed the Philippine market on Tuesday, sending it crashing to its biggest one-day fall in 26 months, and analysts said they saw nothing ahead that would calm the turmoil.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not just bloodletting, this is a massacre,&quot; research director Henry Ong of Sapphire Securities said as the Philippine Stock Exchange key index collapsed by 128.7 points or 4.54 percent to 2,708.44 points.</p>
<p>At the height of carnage, the index composing 30 blue chip companies skidded by 5.14 percent, the sharpest index decline since January 13, 1995 when it fell 5.67 percent to 2,482.04.</p>
<p>Blue chips triggered the chaos as investors, within minutes after trading opened, began dumping some of the heavyweights on fears of first dismal first quarter earnings results. Banks led the initial retreat, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe mayhem is a polite word. It's worse than mayhem,&quot; Irving Ackerman, president of I. Ackerman &amp; Co said.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe they're shifting funds into other markets, that's surely one of the reasons,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like a giant stone falling. You just don't stop it,&quot; Ackerman added. &quot;The momentum is very difficult to stop so probably we'll go down a little bit further.&quot;</p>
<p>Uncurbed fears of a property bust similar to Thailand's helped savage the market despite repeated official assurances that the loan exposures of top-end condominum and mass housing builders were well within tolerable limits, analysts said.</p>
<p>Indices of all sub-sectors dived, with property taking the biggest fall of 5.63 per cent followed by banks and financial institutions which dropped by 4.23 percent.</p>
<p>The battering of the bourse unnerved the currency market. Traders said drop situation would put pressure on the Philippine peso and force the Central Bank to hike interest rates.</p>
<p>The day's worst losers included property firms Ayala Land Inc, which fell by 7.14 percent, mass housing builder Empire East Land Holdings Inc, down by 7.41 percent, and Filinvest Land which dropped by 7.35 percent.</p>
<p>Manila Electric-B skidded by 10.87 percent.</p>
<p>Among the heaviest losers in the financial sector was Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co which skidded by almost six percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Metrobank being the biggest bank, rightly or wrongly, got the brunt of the foreign funds fears over the Philippine banking sector,&quot; said Joey Salceda, director at SBC Warburg.</p>
<p>Anxieties over a possible property glut finally caught up with Ayala Land but analyst Edser Trinidad of Peregrine Securities said he believed Ayala Land would be the least likely to be affected by any crash due to its diverse projects.</p>
<p>Chief economist Villamor Vital of All-Asia Capital and Trust Corp attributed the day's crash to continued lack of buying interest and &quot;a waiting for the bottom.&quot;</p>
<p>Some analysts expect the market to bottom out at between 2,580 and 2,600 but it is hard to predict trends, Vital said.</p>
<p>&quot;When people begin throwing the towel, that's when you expect a recovery will follow,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Only 15 stocks, mostly thirdliners, survived the bloodbath. where 134 issues were severely battered. Turnover was heavy with about 3.5 billion pesos changing hands during the session.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't remember a drop like this for a long time,&quot; Ackerman said. &quot;It's still a little bit grim. For the time being we just have to grit our teeth.&quot;</p>
