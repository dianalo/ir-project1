<p>Israel said on Sunday after talks with Palestinian negotiators that it was unclear if the Palestinian Authority (PA) would accept its plans to hand over nine percent of the West Bank in a pending redeployment.</p>
<p>&quot;They are going back to their chairman (Yasser Arafat), they must consult among themselves and give us an answer,&quot; Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told reporters after a two-hour meeting in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Levy said during the meeting the Palestinian side objected to the size of the redeployment, that it was decided unilaterally by Israel, and that they demanded Israel stop a plan to build a settlement for Jews in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Asked if the differences over the redeployment, which Israel had intended to implement this week, might delay the start of talks on a final peace deal set to begin on March 17, Levy said:</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot say anything until I get their answer. Israel is ready to open final status talks on March 17 as it committed to.&quot;</p>
<p>Levy would not say if Israel would go ahead with the redeployment unilaterally if the Palestinians refused to cooperate.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials were not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>Going into Sunday's meeting, a PA official, accusing Israel of dictating peace, said the Israeli plan would be rejected.</p>
<p>&quot;We want the Israelis to stop the policy of dictation,&quot; PA peace negotiator Saeb Erekat told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The Israelis requested this meeting and we will submit our rejection officially,&quot; Erekat said. &quot;We must decide the scope and the dimension of the redeployment together.&quot;</p>
<p>Levy afterward was adamant that Israel would not negotiate the redeployment nor would it stop the plan to build 6,500 homes for Jews in Arab East Jerusalem at Jabal Abu Ghneim hill, known as Har Homa to Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;The government of Israel is operating according to the agreement,&quot; Levy said.</p>
<p>Palestinian anger over Israel's plans to build more Jewish housing in East Jerusalem and implementation of a three-stage pullback from mainly rural areas of the West Bank is on the rise.</p>
<p>In Gaza, a senior official close to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said the time for passive resistance to Israel's settlement policy was over.</p>
<p>&quot;The danger surrounding us is forcing us to decide whether to be free and masters over our land or slaves of the Israelis,&quot; Ahmed Abdel Rahman, general-secretary of Arafat's cabinet, said in a fiery speech in self-ruled Gaza.</p>
<p>&quot;From now on, resisting settlements will not be through words, condemnation or complaints to the U.N. Security Council,&quot; he told a rally organised by the Islamic National Committee to Resist Settlements and the Palestinian Information Ministry.</p>
<p>The Authority insists under a 1995 deal the first redeployment, expected this week, was to cover 30 percent of the area still controlled by Israel in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Israel has said a U.S. note attached to a deal signed in January put the extent of the pullback at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>Despite its strong criticism, the PA has refrained from setting any conditions for continuing peace talks.</p>
<p>Levy's office said he had cancelled a planned trip to the United States because he and Netanyahu &quot;decided the first priority is to continue the contacts with the Palestinians at the highest level&quot;. He had been slated to leave on Sunday night.</p>
<p>On the domestic front, Netanyahu remained under pressure from Israeli hawks who said the right-wing leader was being too generous in handing over territory to the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Eight legislators in Netanyahu's ruling coalition threatened to bolt the government over the redeployment.</p>
