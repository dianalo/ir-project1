<p>Dutch supermarkets group Ahold NV, announcing a 39 percent surge in 1996 net profits and a three-for-one share split, said on Thursday the current year would see significant earnings per share growth.</p>
<p>Net profit in 1996 shot up to 632.4 million guilders ($327.9 million) from 456.6 million in 1995, in line with forecasts from analysts of 611-641 million guilders. Turnover boomed to 36.54 billion guilders from a year-earlier 29.62 billion.</p>
<p>Fourth quarter net profit jumped to 216.3 million guilders from 132.9 million.</p>
<p>The company, which reports dividends in guilders and dollars, proposed payouts of 0.96 guilders and $0.43 compared to 0.88 guilders and $0.36 in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The consolidated result after taxes will be considerably higher in 1997 than in 1996. Earnings per share will also show significant growth in 1997,&quot; the company said in statement with the results.</p>
<p>Chairman Cees van der Hoeven told a news conference that most areas of the company saw improved profitability in 1996 and that the Stop &amp; Shop U.S. supermarket chain significantly boosted earnings growth. Operating profit in the U.S. surged to $354.2 million, up 60 percent from $222 million in 1995. In the Netherlands operating profit grew 14 percent to 498.3 million guilders while in the rest of Europe it rose by 35 percent to 165.5 million guilders.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other side of the ocean, our position in the U.S. was strengthened to such a degree that we can now speak of a solid base extending along virtually the entire East coast,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The acquisition of Stop &amp; Shop did not just lead to a new arithmetic increase, but to a geometric progression where whole new possibilities for profit improvement have opened up,&quot; Van der Hoeven enthused.</p>
<p>He said market shares increased in the U.S. and the Netherlands with significant productivity gains booked as a result of new applications of technology.</p>
<p>Outside of the mature home markets Ahold saw &quot;significant&quot; profit growth in Portugal, while taking the first steps in Spain towards developing a national supermarket chain with a local partner.</p>
<p>&quot;In the Far East, continued effort allowed our regional growth strategy to produce its first fruits last year -- and it looks like it will be a bumper crop,&quot; he said, adding Ahold would continue to establish and build positions in fast growing emerging markets.</p>
<p>In the Asian region, where Ahold launched supermarket activities last year, the company posted an operational start-up loss of 20.6 million guilders.</p>
<p>&quot;It all looks terribly good, pretty much as expected. We had expected a share-split, but we had thought two-and-a-half for one was more likely,&quot; said Nils Van Elzelingen of NIB Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything seems to have gone well...the outlook is good and they will benefit strongly from the stronger dollar in the next few years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Other analysts were equally positive. &quot;We already knew Ahold was upbeat on 1997, but that it is forecasting significant growth in earnings per share gives reason for satisfaction,&quot; said Erik Vos of Rabo Securities.</p>
<p>Shares in Ahold were 4.30 guilders higher at 136.50 guilders after the results news on a record-breaking Amsterdam Bourse.</p>
