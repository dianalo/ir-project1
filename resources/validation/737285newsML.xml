<p>European semiconductor group SGS-Thomson Microelectronics NV on Thursday announced almost halved profits for the first six months of the year but said it expected an improvement in margins in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The Franco-Italian group said its first-half net income fell to $182.6 million from $351.1 million, while for the second quarter it also dropped by about 48 percent to $92.1 million from $176.1 million.</p>
<p>The per-share figure for the second quarter was $0.66, in line with the company's profit warning on June 5.</p>
<p>The shares fell on the Paris Bourse. At 1052 GMT they were down 1.07 percent at 555 francs.</p>
<p>&quot;There were hopes that the company would have said it saw a rise in margins in the third quarter. It did not, it said the third quarter would be flat and it saw a rise in the fourth quarter,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;SGS has been rising a lot recently because people had been hoping for a positive surprise. There wasn't and now the share is down,&quot; another added.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs analyst Charles Elliott said the second-quarter profit was slightly better than expected but the full year estimates may have to be reduced.</p>
<p>&quot;The second quarter was slightly better than expected. I expected 62 cents, the market average was 65 cents and they delivered 66 cents,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The full-year consensus is $3.50 and that seems a little bit high now that recovery will start in the fourth quarter and not in the third,&quot; Elliott said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the next year consensus of $5-plus is still very reasonable,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Brokerage IMI Sigeco said it had reduced its earnings per share forecast for SGS-Thomson to $3.71 from $3.78 but said the share was undervalued.</p>
<p>&quot;While there may be disappointment in the further delay in the (chip market) recovery, evidence from Texas Instruments and Intel point to an upturn and SGS-Thomson has historically outpaced market growth,&quot; said Denis Gross of IMI in a note to clients.</p>
<p>&quot;Compared to Texas Instruments which trades on 31 times 1997 expected earnings per share, SGS-Thomson remains undervalued,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>SGS-Thomson shares have been rising from 440 francs on June 12 to 561 francs at the close on Wednesday. They added more than 10 percent in the last four trading days alone on better-than-expected results from other high-tech firms such as Intel Corp, which had a 58 percent increase in second-quarter net income, Texas Instruments Inc and Motorola.</p>
<p>&quot;The recovery in the semiconductor industry is progressing, albeit at a slower rate than we anticipated,&quot; said president and chief executive Pasquale Pistorio.</p>
<p>He said that the state of the market was becoming clearer, with a slightly higher order backlog for the third quarter compared to three months ago. &quot;Our fourth quarter backlog has increased significantly since early June,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Based upon this data, we expect to show progressive, sequential improvement in net revenues in the third quarter, with an acceleration in the fourth quarter of 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Net sales fell to $963.9 million from $1.04 billion in the second quarter and to $1.90 billion from $2.06 billion in the first half. The company said sales were up 2.6 percent in the second quarter compared to the first three months of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;We are increasing our level of investment in research and development and capital expenditure to support future growth,&quot; Pistorio said.</p>
<p>Research and Development spending was increased to $151.5 million from $136 million in the second quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time, however, we believe the current pricing environment is likely to continue into the third quarter, resulting in a gross margin for the third quarter in the same range of that of the second quarter. We expect the gross margin to improve in the fourth quarter,&quot; Pistorio said.</p>
<p>The gross margin -- net revenues minus cost of sales as a percentage of sales -- was 38.5 percent in the second quarter and 38.2 percent in the first quarter. It was 44.4 percent in the second quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>SGS-Thomson said that in the 1997 second quarter, 57.2 percent of net revenue derived from differentiated products, with discrete and commodity linear integrated circuits (IC) accounting for 22 percent and logic and memory ICs totalling 20.8 percent.</p>
<p>At end-June, shareholders equity was $3.28 billion while total debt was $569.1 million of which $180.8 million in long term debt.</p>
<p>Some 30 percent of SGS-Thomson shares is currently on the markets while French and Italian state-controlled holdings own some 35 percent each.</p>
