<p>Time Warner Inc, which is taking its New Line Cinema off the market, is close to securing financing for New Line's film production slate, the Wall Street Journal said in Monday's electronic edition.</p>
<p>Initially, Time Warner hoped to generate about $1 billion from selling New Line Cinema but it received bids well below that, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Now, according to Time Warner executives, the company is close to finalizing a five-year financing deal with Chase Manhattan, the paper said.</p>
<p>Chase, which was not immediately available for comment, was seen providing as much as $500 million in credit to New Line, the Journal said.</p>
<p>Time Warner was also not available to comment.</p>
