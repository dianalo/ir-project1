<p>Former Archer Daniels Midland Co executive Mark Whitacre on Friday denied the company's charges that he stole $9 million from it, claiming he received millions in off-the-books bonuses.</p>
<p>&quot;I received $6.5 million, now $7 million with interest (in bonuses),&quot; Whitacre said in a telephone interview. &quot;It was approved by management.&quot;</p>
<p>Whitacre, who acted as a government informant for three years as part of the price-fixing probe, said the $7 million would be returned to ADM shareholders at some point.  </p>
<p>Whitacre, who was fired by ADM in August 1995 on charges he stole millions of dollars, said he planned to file an $80 million wrongful discharge lawsuit against the company.</p>
<p>Whitacre had been president of ADM's BioProducts Division.</p>
<p>Whitacre said he would file his suit against his former employer after the Justice Department issues expected charges against the company.</p>
<p>As previously reported, a source close to the probe said the Justice Department was pressing ADM to accept a plea agreement to settle allegations of price fixing in the lysine, citric acid and high fructose corn syrup markets.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will wait until after the indictments,&quot; Whitacre said, referring to the timing of his lawsuit.</p>
<p>&quot;I assume they (ADM) want to keep the focus off their indictments being announced next week,&quot; Whitacre said of the suit ADM filed against him on Thursday in state court in Macon County, Illinois.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with the federal case said the situation was fluid and charges might not be filed next week.</p>
<p>Whitacre claimed that some of the documents ADM has submitted as evidence in the company's suit against him included allegedly forged signatures of his.</p>
<p>&quot;(Some) of the signatures aren't mine,&quot; he said.</p>
