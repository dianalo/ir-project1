<p>Canada's venerable public broadcaster, the CBC, announced on Thursday it was cutting 2,500 jobs and eliminating all U.S. programmes in an attempt to reinvent itself with a much smaller budget.</p>
<p>The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. released long-awaited details on how it would cope with the hundreds of millions of dollars shred from its government subsidies.</p>
<p>&quot;We must move quickly,&quot; CBC President Perrin Beatty told reporters. &quot;The bulk or our reductions must be implemented within the next six months or our checks will bounce.&quot;</p>
<p>The CBC said the drastic new measures would reduce its operating budget by C$127 million ($92.7 million) by 1998. The CBC, with its sprawling television and radio broadcasts in French and English, has already announced a series of other measures that would pare more than a third from its C$1.4 billion ($1 billion) budget by 1998.</p>
<p>The Canadian government has contributed nearly two-thirds of the CBC budget in the past, but the government's scramble to rein in its own troubled finances has led to deep cuts in funding for the CBC.</p>
<p>The CBC, once similar in makeup to Britain's BBC, has turned increasingly to American situation comedies as well as big name sporting events to make up for lost federal revenues.</p>
<p>As CBC became more commercially oriented, some have called for abolishment of the public broadcaster as it appeared to be competing with private broadcasters to stay on the air.</p>
<p>Others sought CBC to return to its roots. It was established as an act of Parliament in 1936 with a mandate to protect and promote the fragile Canadian identity from the American cultural giant to the south.</p>
<p>CBC developed programmes such as its classic &quot;Hockey Night In Canada&quot; on television and its public affairs show &quot;As It Happens&quot; on radio to tell Canadians what was happening in their own country.</p>
<p>Beatty said the new plan would return it to its roots with elimination of American shows. But it will also include more advertising. For the first time, the CBC's flagship evening news show, the National, will run advertisements.</p>
<p>CBC did not announce the closing of any local television stations, but instead spread the cuts across the board, forcing all departments to deal with substantially reduced resources.</p>
<p>American programming will be gone from both prime time and day time schedules by September, 1998 and will be replaced by other shows created in-house or with more co-productions with private firms.</p>
<p>&quot;In the future we will live or die on our Canadian productions.&quot; Beatty said.</p>
