<p>If Compagnie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux were to merge, they would form France's ninth-biggest company in market value and come just behind traditional rival Generale des Eaux.</p>
<p>&quot;Lyonnaise does not have the financial means to realise its ambitions. A link with Suez would give it a big boost,&quot; an analyst said on Monday. &quot;People would like to see it modelled in a way like the Generale (des Eaux),&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Data in Reuters Securities 3000 on Monday show that Suez ranks 20th with a market capitalisation of 45.8 billion francs and Lyonnaise holds the 30th place with a value of 33.2 billion.</p>
<p>Combined at 79 billion, they would come between the 91.9 billion of Generale des Eaux and the 71.8 billion of glassmaker Compagnie de Saint-Gobain.</p>
<p>Suez, established nearly 140 years ago to finance the building of the Suez canal, has recently been cutting drastically in its activities to purge property-related losses.</p>
<p>The cutbacks, made by Gerard Mestrallet who was made chairman in July 1995, left the company with &quot;lots of assets but without a clear business,&quot; said a financial analyst in Paris.</p>
<p>Lyonnaise des Eaux, meanwhile, is still smarting from the 1990 merger with building group Dumez and has also had to carry heavy property losses. The company is active in its pure water purification and distribution field, as well as in media with a stake in M6 and the TPS satellite television venture.</p>
<p>Analyst Jean-Baptiste Bellon at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said he expected Suez to bid for the Lyonnaise shares, either in paper or in cash.</p>
<p>&quot;Debt would perhaps facilitate the operation but it would burden the new group. It's more likely to be in paper,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Based on the company's market values, Suez weighing 1.37 times as much as Lyonnaise and the number of outstanding shares, a paper bid could be two Suez shares for one Lyonnaise.</p>
<p>Suez had shareholders equity of 41.46 billion francs at the end of 1995. It obtained important cash and liquid assets after the sale of investment bank Banque Indosuez and of a four billion franc property loan porfolio to U.S. fund Whitehall.</p>
<p>It also has an unused tax credit estimated at nine billion francs -- allowing the group to avoid paying three billion francs in taxes over future profits.</p>
<p>It made a 1995 net attributable loss of 3.96 billion francs and analysts expect it to report a 1996 net profit of about 1.147 billion francs, doubling to 2.585 billion in 1997.</p>
<p>Lyonnaise has shareholders funds of 16.46 billion, made a 1995 net attributable profit of 906 million francs and is expected by analysts to show a 1996 net profit of 1.26 billion, rising slightly to 1.6 billion in 1997.</p>
<p>Suez has an 16.8 percent stake in Lyonnaise and has 20 percent of voting rights. Insurer Axa-UAP has a 4.4 percent stake in Lyonnaise, Credit Agricole 3.3 percent and Spain's Aquas de Barcelone 1.4 percent.</p>
<p>Suez's main assets are in Belgium, through Societe Generale de Belgique, with a stake in utilities group Tractebel, bank Generale de Banque, financial group Fortis  AMEV.AS and non-ferrous metals group Union Miniere.</p>
<p>Suez's main shareholders are Credit Agricole with 7.5 percent, Saint-Gobain with 6.2 percent, Banque Nationale de Paris with 5.5 percent, insurer Axa-UAP with 5.46 percent and Belgium's Groupe Bruxelles Lambert with more than six percent.</p>
<p>Suez chairman Mestrallet is seconded by a strategy commitee of board members which includes Saint-Gobain's Jean-Louis Beffa, oil company Elf-Aquitaine head Philippe Jaffre, Credit Agricole's Lucien Douroux, along with Jacques Friedmann, chairman of the supervisory board of Axa-UAP and Lyonnaise's Monod.</p>
