<p>Aggressive bidding by speculators in front-line stocks buoyed by market expectations of positive government announcements helped Bombay shares stage a smart rally on Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>A firm market undertone displayed in the previous trading session weighed on minds of market participants with operators pushing up key stocks to higher levels, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a headline driven market,&quot; said chief dealer Sanjeev Choithani at Pashupati Advani, a domestic firm</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, we are seeing a buying euphoria by speculators,&quot; a trader at a foreign brokerage said.  </p>
<p>Foreign funds, a major influence in Indian markets, have yet to resume buying in a big way after seasonal holidays, but local institutions and speculators have been active bidders in stocks.</p>
<p>Some contrarian players see the lack of fund buying aiding the market rally. &quot;This (rally) can go on for a while...I think the bullish news is that fund managers are not bullish..,&quot; said Kamal Kabra, BSE broker and a former president.</p>
<p>Players are now banking on policy measures to boost up the markets. The policies which are likely to be announced by the government in mid-January are expected to give a phillip to industrial growth and revive dull capital markets.  </p>
<p>Indian industry is expected to do better in the second half of 1996/97 (April-March) than in the first, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) said in a recent report.</p>
<p>While there were indications of a slowdown in the industrial sector, there were no signs of a recession, the Bombay-based independent research firm said.</p>
<p>The 50-stock National Stock Exchange index rose 15.15 points to 943.95. SBI was up 2.25 rupees to 250.0, Bajaj Auto 10.0 to 916.75, MTNL 3.25 to 231.0 and Tata Chemicals 5.0 to 189.25. TISCO however, lost 3.50 to 186.25 and Reliance 1.0 to 218.0.</p>
