<p>A South Korean politician who was deported from Burma for what Rangoon said was his previous interference in the country's internal affairs lashed out at Burma's military on Friday.</p>
<p>Kim San-woo, an opposition member of South Korea's National Assembly, told a news conference he was manhandled and forced back on a plane just an hour after landing in Rangoon for a one-day visit.</p>
<p>&quot;I was absolutely appalled at the treatement I had received. They physically forced me out, and manhandled me,&quot; Kim told reporters a day after returning from Rangoon. &quot;They say I am a troublemaker, but why issue a visa to a troublemaker?&quot;</p>
<p>He said immigration officials pulled him away when he went to get his passport stamped. They then asked him to leave the country and when he protested and asked to see representatives of his embassy they forcibly put him on the plane to Bangkok.</p>
<p>Kim, who as member of his government's Foreign Affairs Committee travels under a diplomatic passport, said he would call on his government to make an official investigation of the matter after returning to Seoul.</p>
<p>A statement issued by Burma's military government said Kim was refused entry into Burma on February 6, and sent out of the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr Kim Sang Woo is a member of the Forum of Democratic Leaders in the Asia Pacific Region and has visited Myanmar (Burma) during June of 1996,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;During his first visit Dr Kim Sang Woo blatantly interfered in the internal affairs of Myanmar and also collaborated against the country with the anti-government elements residing abroad,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Kim said he had visited Burma twice before, and met with democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, diplomats and representatives of non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p>The Burmese government statement said Kim had submitted a proposal last November to the Forum of Democratic Leaders in the Pacific Region Conference dissuading members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) from having &quot;constructive engagement&quot; with Burma.</p>
<p>The seven-nation ASEAN follows a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Burma is seeking to enter the grouping soon, but several Western nations and human rights organisations have urged ASEAN not to allow Burma to become a member until it improves its human rights situation.</p>
<p>Kim said he did not submit the proposal, but said the conference of leading democrats adopted a declaration urging an arms and economic embargo on Burma. It also urged the international business community to freeze investments until a new government was in place in Rangoon.</p>
<p>Kim said he went to Burma to try and understand the current political situation, following unrest in December and increased pressure on the democracy movement and Suu Kyi.</p>
<p>&quot;To act like this ...was very stupid,&quot; he said. &quot;I wonder if they're that insecure to not allow me to stay one day. By their action this could be most detrimental to their efforts.&quot;</p>
