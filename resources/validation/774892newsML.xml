<p>French international libero Laurent Blanc has no illusions about his new French club Marseille compared with the team he left to join them, Spanish giants Barcelona.</p>
<p>Despite celebrating his return to the French first division by scoring twice as Marseille beat Le Havre 3-1 on Saturday, Blanc said the former European champions could not be likened with Barcelona.</p>
<p>&quot;If you ask me to compare Marseille to Barcelona, I'd rather not say anything. With all due respect to Marseille, Barcelona are a super team,&quot; the 31-year-old defender said.</p>
<p>But he feels Marseille could measure up better in the future. &quot;Marseille is the only French club with the potential to become one day a great team like Barcelona,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Blanc struggled last season to earn a regular place with Barcelona and returned to France with the two ambitions of leading Marseille back to the top and earning a place in France's World Cup squad.</p>
<p>Helping Marseille qualify for the European Cup competition &quot;is more than a challenge, it is a must. This town won't accept failure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The former Auxerre player's first test as Marseille's new skipper was very promising.</p>
<p>A penalty in the 51st minute and a free kick five minutes later brought his goal tally in the first division to 70 as he saved his new team from a major setback.</p>
<p>Le Havre had opened the scoring in the 20th minute through Christophe Horlaville.</p>
<p>&quot;Soccer remains a team sport. I'd rather talk about the reaction the team had after a poor start,&quot; said Blanc, who anchors the brand new defence built by new coach Rolland Courbis.</p>
<p>Xavier Gravelaine scored Marseille's third goal on the hour, allowing his team to take a very provisional second place in the league standings.</p>
<p>Marseille have no time to relax as they host Nantes on Friday in a key fixture.</p>
<p>It is a little too early for Blanc to make up his mind on whether he made the right choice.</p>
<p>&quot;I rather liked this team. We still need to improve but it is only natural with eight new players,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>What most impressed the towering libero was the crowd, reduced to 20,000 while works for next summer's World Cup are under way.</p>
<p>&quot;I was impressed by the noise they made in such a crippled stadium. When the works are completed, they will be a great bonus,&quot; Blanc added.</p>
