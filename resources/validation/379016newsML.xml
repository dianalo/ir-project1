<p>Indian call money ended Friday unchanged in the 0.10-0.50 range with no deals struck in overnight money, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said no trades took place as it was the fortnightly reporting day. Banks do not normally borrow on reporting days as it increases their reserve requirements for the next fortnight.</p>
<p>Dealers said three-day money was quoted around 4.50 percent at close of trade, down from the opening 5.0-6.0 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the market has realised the rates yesterday were an aberration,&quot; said a dealer at a state-run bank.</p>
<p>Call money rates touched 10.75 percent on Thursday on shortage of funds and lender-driven quotes, dealers said. Rates had been in the 5.0-6.5 percent range last fortnight.</p>
<p>Some dealers expect some volatility in the call market on Saturday on account of the redemption of India Development Bonds by the State Bank of India.</p>
<p>Prices of government securities went up in moderate trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices went up across maturities but volumes were light,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;Market players are waiting to see how call will open tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>The 13.40 percent 1999 government of India stock traded on Friday at 101.55 rupees against its last traded price of 101.49 while the 14 percent 2005 stock rose to 102.75 from 102.69, dealers said.</p>
<p>Treasury bills maturing in August yielded 9.20 percent against last yield of 9.35, they said.</p>
