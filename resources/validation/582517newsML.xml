<p>China's A and B share indices ended sharply down on Wednesday for the second day in a row on fears that Beijing is planning tough measures to cool down the over-heated stock markets, analysts said.</p>
<p>The falls suddenly reversed a strong upward trend during which the indices on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges have risen over 50 percent since the start of this year.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Shanghai's foreign currency B share index plunged 6.22 percent to end at 87.511 points and its Shenzhen counterpart lost 4.27 percent to 170.74 points.</p>
<p>On the domestic share markets, the Shanghai A share index shed 5.8 percent to 1,442.517 points and Shenzhen's A index fell 5.92 percent to 500.03 points.</p>
<p>&quot;The wolf is coming again,&quot; said a broker with a major Chinese brokerage. &quot;The current market conditions are the same as in mid-December last year when Beijing launched a crackdown.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;People think the government is really going to turn the markets upside-down,&quot; a Shenzhen-based analyst at J&amp;A Securities said.</p>
<p>But other analysts said they expected the markets to start moving back up again after a short correction. One foreign analyst predicted the Shanghai B share index would hit 100 within 10 days, which another said it would do so by July 1.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just a temporary pullback,&quot; said John Crossman of Jardine Fleming. &quot;The big one (correction) comes after the Hong Kong handover.&quot;</p>
<p>China's stock markets started to recover from a two-year slump in April last year, and started a powerful surge which pushed them up 100 percent by mid-December, largely on the back of improvements in the national economic outlook.</p>
<p>The rises alarmed securities authorities, who issued a stern warning against overheated markets through the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, which brought the markets down 30 percent almost overnight.</p>
<p>But in January they started to climb again with investors bullish on the Chinese takeover of Hong Kong at midnight on June 30 and the improving performance of listed firms.</p>
<p>&quot;The authorities have taken a series of measures to cool down the markets and have warned investors about risk time and again but nobody paid any notice,&quot; said a stock trader. &quot;This is likely to lead them to take tougher measures.&quot;</p>
<p>Beijing has announced an issue of four billion yuan ($482 million) in convertible bonds and five billion yuan more new domestic A shares this year and has also pushed up the stamp tax for stock-trading to counter the overheating of the markets.</p>
<p>Traders said a wide range of rumours were circulating on possible new measures, including the possible listing of the huge number of institutional shares that are currently non-tradeable.</p>
<p>Another referred to a possible extension of the transaction settlement period to three days in a bid to reduce market volatility. The current settlement period is one day for A shares and immediate settlement for B shares.</p>
<p>Other rumours said the securities authorities may suspend the trading licences of several major brokerages for alleged market manipulation.</p>
<p>Officials with the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the securities watchdog, have declined to comment.</p>
<p>On the Shanghai B share market, Shanghai Lianhua Fibre Co and Shanghai Goods and Materials Trading Centre Co were major losers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Both stocks hit a 10-percent limit-down level, with Lianhua closing at $0.16 and Goods and Materials at $0.18.</p>
<p>In Shenzhen's B market, Shenzhen Fangda Co was the biggest loser, falling HK$1.28 or 9.7 percent to HK$11.91.</p>
