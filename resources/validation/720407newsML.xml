<p>Jordan's Arab Potash Company expects to award the mandate to a global investment bank to lead manage its GDR offering worth at least $50 million in early September, company officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We received all the offers and we will evaluate them.. we expect a decision after the company's board meeting approves the winning bank in early September,&quot; said a company official.</p>
<p>Last month Arab Potash invited eight global institutions who had already shown interest in arranging a GDR (Global Depository Receipt) listing to submit proposals by July 10.</p>
<p>Investment banking sources say among the firms which have submitted offers are HSBC Markets, ING Barings, Union Bank of Switzerland, Paribas, Nomura, Merrill Lynch and Flemings.</p>
<p>The majority state-owned firm, one of Jordan's top exporters, said the proposals should include the global investment firms' track records in the Middle East and their proposed pricing range of the GDR offering.</p>
<p>The GDR offering, the first such issue by a Jordanian firm to tap the international equity market, would raise the company's international profile and allow it in future to tap cheaper credit for ambitious expansion projects.</p>
<p>Arab Potash said it was considering a minimum $50 million GDR issue which would put on offer 3.62 million shares left unsubscribed from an earlier public issue, along with a portion of a 55.4 percent government stake in the firm.</p>
<p>Arab Potash, whose authorised capital is 83.3 million dinars, has currently a 79.7 million dinars paid up capital.</p>
<p>The firm is one of the world's major producers of potash, a key ingredient in the fertiliser industry and has ambitious plans to develop its downstream industry.</p>
<p>As well as the Jordanian government, several Arab states including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have minority holdings.</p>
