<p>A powerful quake struck Venezuela's central and eastern coastal region on Wednesday, toppling a large office building and killing at least four people, a local government official said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment we have serious damage to a number of buildings and four dead and 20 wounded have been reported,&quot; Sucre state governor Ramon Martinez told local Union Radio.</p>
<p>The deaths occurred when a tower block in Sucre capital Cumana collapsed, Martinez said. Only one person had been rescued alive from the rubble, he added.</p>
<p>A Cumana resident who spoke to Reuters by cellular phone said the building had folded in on itself. &quot;It just collapsed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Martinez called on residents to assemble at local sports fields and declared the state in emergency.</p>
<p>Gerber Rondon of the FUNVISIS seismological institute said the quake had a magnitude of 5.5 on the Richter scale centred off the Paria Peninsula on Venezuela's northeastern Caribbean coast. The quake struck at 3:25 p.m. (1925 GMT) and was followed by three aftershocks, Rondon told the Globovision television network.</p>
<p>The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado, said the quake measured 6.9 on the open-ended Richter scale.</p>
<p>The quake, which shook most of Venezuela's central and eastern coastal region, rattled office buildings in downtown Caracas and led to panicked calls to local radio stations.</p>
<p>Radio reports said the quake had caused toppled a wall, which fell on 60 cars on the Caribbean island Margarita and cut phone and power lines to several cities.</p>
