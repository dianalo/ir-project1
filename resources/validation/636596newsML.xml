<p>A leftist guerrilla army in Mexico has declared a unilateral truce starting on Wednesday night to safeguard congressional elections set for July 6, a rebel communique said.</p>
<p>The Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR) announced the truce, set for 8 p.m. EDT (2400 GMT) on Wednesday, after election officials and the Catholic Church appealed to the guerrillas to halt fighting ahead of the nationwide elections.</p>
<p>In a statement published in Mexico City newspapers on Wednesday, the ERP said the truce would be in effect until after the elections.</p>
<p>The truce is &quot;a form of expressing our repect for the electoral struggle that, together with other forms of struggle, has the objective of building a social and historical force that will recoup the sovereign will of the country from the oppressive government,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The EPR unveiled itself in June last year.</p>
<p>After a coordinated offensive on military targets in several Mexican states last August, the EPR eased back on its military activities in recent months in favour of a propaganda campaign.  But that respite came to a bloody end with a string of battles between the army and rebels late last month that killed at least nine people.</p>
<p>On July 6, Mexicans will chose all 500 deputies to Mexico's lower house of Congress, 32 of 128 senators, six state governors and the mayor of Mexico City. Analysts say the elections will be a major test of strength for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Pary (PRI).</p>
<p>The EPR, most active in the poor states of Guerrero and neighbouring Oaxaca, has called for the overthrow of the Mexican government but is not widely seen as force capable of threatening the Mexican army on a wide scale.</p>
<p>It has no known links to the Zapatista National Liberation Army, the predominantly Maya Indian rebel force that launched an uprising in Chiapas state in 1994. A formal ceasefire is in place there while peace talks are at an impasse.</p>
