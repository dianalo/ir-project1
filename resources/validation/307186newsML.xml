<title>UK: OECD Nov 96 industry oil stockdraw 0.6 mbod - IEA.</title>
<headline>OECD Nov 96 industry oil stockdraw 0.6 mbod - IEA.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-14</dateline>

<p>Industry-held oil inventories in OECD member nations fell 0.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in November 1996, the same rate of stockdraw seen in November 1995, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In its end-December Monthly Oil Market Report, the Paris-based IEA said OECD members held 78 million barrels less stocks at the end of November as they did a year earlier.</p>
<p>However, inventories of distillates, including diesel and heating oil, actually rose 0.1 million bpd in November compared to a 0.5 million bpd stockdraw in November 1995.  </p>
<p>The build enabled the OECD member countries to narrow the year-on-year distillate shortfall to 17 million barrels.</p>
<p>North American distillate inventories were 17 million barrels below 1995 levels but the European shortfall had declined to three million barrels and OECD Pacific distillate stocks continued to exceed last year's levels, the IEA said.</p>
<p>&quot;The most significant development was the continuing decline in the distillate shortfall...By the end of the month, the region with the largest shortfall had switched from Europe to North America,&quot; the agency said.</p>
<p>Low heating oil stocks on both sides of the Atlantic have stoked a rally which has kept oil prices near post Gulf War highs for several months at a time of buoyant weather-driven demand.</p>
<p>Crude stocks in the OECD dell 0.3 mbpd in November compared to a 0.6 mbpd increase in November 1995.</p>
<p>In North America, the IEA said, crude stocks &quot;decreased sharply, consistent with a significant reduction in crude imports.&quot;</p>
<p>At end-November, U.S. crude stocks stood 24 million barrels below end-November 1995 levels but gasoline stocks were little changed to stand just 10 million barrels below end-November 1995 levels.</p>
<p>In Europe, crude stocks rose in November to end the month 10 million barrels above 1995 levels while gasoline stocks were little changed to end four percent below November 1995.</p>
<p>Following a steep rise in October crude stocks in the OECD Pacific dipped 0.1 mbpd in November, the IEA said, to end the month close to 1995 levels.</p>
<p>OECD Pacific gasoline stocks remained essentially unchanged for the third month in a row and by end-November were just below 1995 levels.</p>
