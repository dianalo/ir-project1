<p>A German container ship was on Thursday in danger of breaking up and leaking bunker oil after it ran aground off the coast of Iceland in heavy seas, leaving one rescue-crew member missing, an Icelandic coast guard official said.</p>
<p>An attempt by a local coast guard vessel to tow the freighter ashore failed, and one Icelandic crew member went overboard in the process, the official said.</p>
<p>The body had not yet been recovered.</p>
<p>All 19 of the German crew were safe after being rescued from the ship by helicopter, the official added.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the vessel) is now aground in very bad weather and listing 40 percent. There is considerable visible damage to the ship -- it is breaking apart,&quot; the official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters by telephone from Reykjavik.</p>
<p>The 8,000-tonne Vikartindur went aground at 1947 GMT on Wednesday about 1.5 miles from the Icelandic coast after being struck by a heavy wave. It had been drifting for about two hours because of engine trouble.</p>
<p>The ship was leased by Iceland's largest shipping company Eimskip, the official said. The ship was owned by a major German shipping company, he said, but gave no details.</p>
<p>The ship was carrying cargo, all of which was in containers, from Germany to Iceland, the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The owners, insurance companies and rescue teams are at the site and looking for ways to minimise the loss,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A small amount of the 350 tonnes of heavy oil on board the ship had begun to leak, and more pollution was feared.</p>
<p>No one could board the ship because of the bad weather, freezing temperatures and gales measuring 40 to 70 knots.</p>
