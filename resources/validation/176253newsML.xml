<p>Britain's Burmah Castrol Plc is planning to build at least two new Asia-Pacific lubricant plants to hike production by 25 percent or more over the next five years, a senior company official said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the past five years (Asia-Pacific) capacity grew by at least 25 percent. Growth in the next five years should be at least similar,&quot; Ian Pringle, director of Castrol Asia Pacific, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Castrol has 18 manufacturing plants in the Asia-Pacific region producing between 400 million and 500 million litres of lubricant products annually.</p>
<p>The region contributes about 30 percent of the Castrol group's revenue, Pringle said.</p>
<p>He said Castrol's production capacity should stay in line with annual demand growth in the region of about 10 percent. To ensure this, the company would be raising output by building two or three new plants and expanding existing ones, he said.</p>
<p>In line with the company's ambitious plan for the Asia-Pacific region, Castrol on Friday commissioned a Singapore $33 million lubricants plant that is capable of manufacturing 60 million litres of products a year in a single shift.</p>
<p>Output at the plant can be expanded to more than 100 million litres of products a year through extended shift operations.</p>
<p>Next week, the company will open a 60 million litre lubricants plant in India. The U.S.$18-million plant is Castrol's seventh in India, which is the company's fastest growing market.</p>
<p>Castrol's Indian unit is the third biggest within the group, after the U.S and Germany, Pringle said.</p>
<p>After mid-November, Castrol will begin construction works on its first lubricant plant in Guangdong province in China. The U.S.$25 million joint-venture plant will be capable of producing 25 million litres of lubricants.</p>
<p>Castrol is also studying the feasibility of building a second plant in northeast Asia, either in the Shanghai area in China or in Japan, Pringle said.</p>
<p>Commenting on the current consolidation of assests by major oil companies through mergers, Pringle said that Castrol does not face the same pressures as it is a specialist lubricants company. &quot;We don't have that kind of cost,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The consolidation is also not likely to have an adverse impact on Castrol as its core business is the sale of premium lubricants and not fuels.</p>
<p>&quot;We are staying clear of the commodity part,&quot; Pringle said.</p>
