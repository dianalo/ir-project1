<title>CHINA: Shanghai Diesel to issue 85 million B shares.</title>
<headline>Shanghai Diesel to issue 85 million B shares.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1996-11-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shanghai Diesel Engine Co Ltd will issue 85 million additional B shares at $0.405 each on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the company said on Friday.</p>
<p>In a notice published in the Shanghai Securities News, the company said that it would use the money raised from the issue to expand production of its series D114 diesel engines and raise annual output to 30,000 units a year.</p>
<p>The firm already has A and B share listed on the Shanghai exchange.  </p>
<p>After the issue, the company will have a total of 480.3 million shares, including 241.7 million state shares, 21.6 million A shares and 217 million B shares, the notice said.</p>
<p>It forecast 1996 post-tax profits at 144.076 million yuan, down from an actual 153.020 million in 1995, using international accounting standards.</p>
<p>Shenyin Wanguo Securities is lead underwriter for the issue and international co-ordinator is Wheelock Natwest.</p>
<p>One Chinese broker said he regarded Shanghai Diesel as a &quot;recovery play&quot;, because its business would benefit from the recovery in the Chinese economy with the ending of the austerity policy, a nation-wide hold-down on credit in force since 1993.</p>
<p>Profits will fall this year because the austerity policy has resulted in zero growth in sales but they will improve in 1997, he said.</p>
<p>The company is China's biggest maker of diesel engines and has a wide range of clients, he said, adding that the issue was likely to be well received.</p>
