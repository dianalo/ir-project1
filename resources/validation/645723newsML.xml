<p>A full calendar sprinkled with some heavy-hitting deals like Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. and Santa Fe International Corp. may make this week the most lucrative one this year in the market for initial public offerings.</p>
<p>According to CommScan, a New York-based research firm, about $2.38 billion is set to be raised this week, beating the earlier 1997 record for the week of May 22 of $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>IPOs, after being in the doldrums in the first quarter of this year, seem to be waking up to a new dawn.</p>
<p>&quot;The wind's at the back of the IPO market at this point,&quot; said John Fitzgibbon, editor of the IPO Aftermarket. He said that since early April, of the 75 initial public offerings that have been priced, winners -- those whose share price has risen since the offering -- have outnumbered losers by six to one as of June 5.</p>
<p>Analysts said the resurgence of interest in small and midcap stocks was the primary force behind the renewed enthusiasm for new issues. &quot;The IPO market hitches its wagon to the Nasdaq composite,&quot; said Fitzgibbon.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite, which started April at about 1,216, closed at a near-record high of 1,404.84 on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;From April to the present there's been a snap back in the smallcap sector,&quot; said Richard Smith, managing director of syndicate at Montgomery Securities, &quot;and that's making the general feeling about the new issue market much more universal, rather than just focused on big-caps.&quot;</p>
<p>While analysts expect a number of smaller issues to perform well this week, the attention will be focused on the high-profile larger deals.</p>
<p>Topping the list is New York-based designer Ralph Lauren's IPO, which could command a premium of $5 or more at its debut, according to David Menlow,  president of Springfield, N.J.-based IPO Financial Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;Polo is on autopilot,&quot; he said. &quot;It's had our highest ranking that we can give to an IPO since the first time it disclosed terms.&quot;</p>
<p>A total of 29.5 million shares are being offered, of which 23.5 million are being sold in the United States. The expected price is between $22 and $25 a share.</p>
<p>Menlow said he sees a $2 to $3 opening premium for Santa Fe International, an offshore and land contract driller that is being spun off from parent company Kuwait Petroleum Corp. The company is selling 30 million shares in a global offering with a price range of $24 to $27. Twenty-four million shares are slated for the United States.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is lead underwriter for both Polo and Santa Fe.</p>
<p>Another issue expected to generate interest is that of Iridium World Communications Ltd. The company, which is developing a global communications wireless network to be linked by 66 proposed satellites, is offering 10 million shares at an estimated price of $19 to $21 a share.</p>
<p>The week's calendar goes on to offer some choice pickings among the smaller issues, and analysts are upbeat on Racing Champions Corp., Peapod Inc. and Maximus Inc..</p>
<p>Racing Champions, a producer of scaled die-cast vehicle replicas targeted at racing fans and collecters, is launching an IPO of five million shares with a per share range of $12 to $14. Menlow said he sees the stock gaining $1 or more at its debut.</p>
<p>Online grocery shopping and delivery company Peapod is selling 3.6 million shares at $13 to $15 a share and is expected to garner a premium of 75 cents or more.</p>
<p>Fitzgibbon said he sees a similar pop for Maximus, which provides program management and consulting services to government health and human services agencies. A total of 4.4 million shares are on offer at a price of $13 to $15 a share.</p>
