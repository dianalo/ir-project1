<p>Credit Lyonnais, the French bank which nearly collapsed under the weight of its lending excesses, reported on Thursday a modest rise in net profit for 1996 and a big improvement in underlying performance.</p>
<p>The state-controlled bank, rescued twice by the state, said net attributable profit rose to 202 million francs ($35.5 million) from a 1995 profit of 13 million francs.</p>
<p>But pretax, pre-exceptional profit tripled to 4.5 billion francs from 1.5 billion &quot;reflecting the recovery across the group's businesses&quot; and the impact of restructuring, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;1996 marks a spectacular recovery in the profitability of Credit Lyonnais,&quot; said chairman Jean Peyrelevade, who steered the bank's turnaround from virtual bankruptcy following an expansion binge in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
<p>The upturn is bound to anger rivals who say taxpayers have paid for the bank's recovery. The ultimate bill to the state for saving Credit Lyonnais is expected to top 130 billion francs.</p>
<p>The figures included charges of 2.48 billion francs for restructuring and 200 million francs to prepare for the move to European monetary union in 1999.</p>
<p>They also included a 107 million franc payment to the state under terms of the 1995 state rescue which stipulated it had to earmark a portion of its profits for the public purse.</p>
<p>The bank, which lost 21 billion francs between 1992 and 1994, would have plunged back into the red again if the government had not agreed last year to ease the terms of the 1995 salvage which turned out to be unrealistically punitive.</p>
<p>For 1997, Peyrelevade forecast net profit &quot;in the billions&quot; of francs and predicted the bank would rapidly catch up with rivals in operating profitability.</p>
<p>Despite the strong performance, the bank will still need another big dose of public money to ready it for sale. The government hopes to privatise the bank in early 1999.</p>
<p>Peyrelevade said the state &quot;will have to bear the cost&quot; for the bank's wayward past. &quot;There is no other solution,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The improved underlying performance was driven by lower operating expenses helped by staff cuts and strong returns from financial services and capital market activities. Net additions to provisions on individual loans fell 25 percent.</p>
<p>Net banking income was flat at 44.5 billion francs against 43.4 billion but rose 5.9 percent on a like-for-like base, helped by buoyant international and capital market activities.</p>
<p>Net fee income jumped 7.9 percent -- and 13 percent on a like-for-like basis -- boosted by contributions from financial services and the distribution of insurance products. Gross operating profit soared 42 percent to 9.5 billion francs.</p>
<p>All four of the bank's profit centres showed better results. In France, although banking income fell one percent, profits were up sharply, helped by a 3.5 percent fall in operating costs due to a fall in staff. Elsewhere in Europe, operating profits were up 34 percent, reflecting a cleanup of loan portfolios.</p>
<p>In the rest of the world, the commercial banking sector showed a 60 percent rise in operating profit, reflecting record profits in such areas as Asia, Eastern Europe and North America. Capital market operating profits rose 2.5 times.</p>
<p>The bank, whose expansion briefly made it the biggest bank outside Japan, said its recovery plan involved a &quot;strategic recentring&quot; around domestic retail banking and an international banking business geared to large firms and financial markets.</p>
<p>In exchange for approving the 1995 bailout, the European Commission ordered the bank to sell off 35 percent of its non-French banking assets by the end of 1998. It is likely to demand more disposals to sanction the newest aid package to be presented by the centre-right government by early April.</p>
<p>The package is expected to involve the injection of at least 10 billion francs to get it up to acceptable solvency levels.</p>
<p>Peyrelevade said the bank envisaged a 50 percent cut in its European presence but there would be no fire sales. The bank's 51 percent stake in Germany's BfG &quot;was not for sale today,&quot; he said. Analysts suggest a sale could trigger a big capital loss.</p>
<p>He said the bank had already cut staff by 28 percent outside France and cut its balance sheet outside Europe by 15 percent.</p>
