<p>Shanghai's B share index surged 9.203 points or 12.22 percent to end at a 1996 closing high of 84.534 points on Tuesday, with supply of shares unable to meet strong demand, traders said.</p>
<p>They said the scale of the market was too small for the huge demand from institutional and individual investors, both Chinese and foreign, with some shares rising about 200 percent over the last three trading days.</p>
<p>Another factor was the large price gap that still exists between B shares and their A share equivalents and between B shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, they said.  </p>
<p>Trading volume hit a record of 103.1 million shares worth $47.4 million, surpassing the previous record trading volume of 98.8 million shares set on May 16, 1994.</p>
<p>All 42 B shares traded with 40 up, one flat and one down.</p>
<p>Brokers said the recent sharp rise in prices had attracted huge flows of new capital into the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Every day we are seeing so much fresh capital flowing into the market because investors believe the B share prices are going to move closer to their counterparts in the A share market,&quot; one broker said.  </p>
<p>Another broker said smaller, lower-priced stocks which have been the focus of trading in the past few sessions, had surged too far too fast considering the company fundamentals.</p>
<p>&quot;Follow-up buying will be risky,&quot; another broker said. &quot;But second-tier stocks priced around $0.500 which have good results will become the focus in the next round of the bull run.&quot;</p>
<p>Shanghai Lianhua Fibre was the star on speculative institutional buying. It surged $0.092 or 38.01 percent to $0.334 on volume of 1.9 million shares.  </p>
<p>Shanghai Huili Building Material traded the most, soaring $0.370 or 32.14 percent to $0.370 on volume of 8.8 million shares.</p>
<p>The Shanghai A share index dipped on a technical correction after sharp gains in the past few days, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index ended down 23.017 points or 1.76 percent to 1283.763 points on volume of 1.1 billion shares worth 13.9 billion yuan. The SSE 30 Blue-Chip index slipped 73.014 points or 2.40 percent to 2965.222 points.</p>
<p>Shanghai Jiafeng was the biggest loser, falling 0.55 yuan or 7.74 percent to 6.55 yuan on volume of 1.3 million shares.</p>
