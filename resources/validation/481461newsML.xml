<p>The Acting Opposition Leader, Gareth Evans, says the Government's defence of Senator Mal Colston's elevation to Acting Senate President is a charade.</p>
<p>Mr Evans says there's no need for a police investigation or conviction to establish a rock-solid prima face case demanding political accountability.</p>
<p>Senator Colston, who's the Deputy President, is Acting Senate President while Margaret Reid is overseas, despite an ongoing investigation into his use of travel allowances.</p>

<p>STADIUM CONFIDENT PASSES WILL BE SOLD</p>
<p>The builders of Sydney's Olympic Stadium say they're confident the remaining available gold passes in the Stadium float will sold, and have assured existing seat holders they won't be discounted.</p>
<p>Stadium Australia attempted to raise over three-hundred-million dollars through the sale of gold Olympic packages at 10-thousand dollars each, but has come up with a two-hundred-million dollar shortfall.</p>
<p>Chairman, Peter Richie, told ABC Radio only 40-per cent of gold seats for the Games have been sold.</p>
<p>Mr Richie says while the stadium's underwriters were over-confident about the float, he expects the remaining 20-thousand passes will be sold.</p>

<p>Representatives from the mining industry and the town's Chamber of Commerce will also speak at the meeting.</p>

<p>NEW MANAGEMENT PRACTICES COULD HAVE LED TO RIOT</p>
<p>Queensland's Corrective Services Minister Russel Cooper says he wants new management practices introduced at Woodford Prison to continue, despite last night's riot.</p>
<p>Corrective Services Commisioner Keith Hamburger says the Commission's introduced a policy which encourages prison officers to interact more with prisoners, enabling staff to observe prisoners more closely and get on top of any problems that arise.</p>
<p>He admits it may have contributed to the riot, and says it seems some inmates don't like staff in their space.</p>
<p>But Mr Cooper says the Government won't be backing off because of resistance from a few prisoners.</p>

<p>NO SUBMISSION BY FOREIGN AFFAIRS ON RA</p>
<p>The chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee says considers it a serious ommission by the Department of Foreign Affairs not to have forwarded a formal submission on the future of ABC's Radio Australia and Australia Television.</p>
<p>A first assistant secretary of the Foreign Affairs Department, Bill Fisher, told the Senate committee there was no written submission because Radio Australia's future is being considered by the Government.</p>
<p>Michael Forshaw, said the inquiry would press the Foreign Affairs Minister for a submission, describing it as more than disappointing. - - - -</p>
<p>VIC OPPOSITION ON THE ATTACK OVER FELICITY'S BMW</p>
<p>The Victorian Opposition has gone on the attack in Parliament over BMW's gift of a car to the Premier's wife, Felicity Kennett.</p>
<p>The Shadow Attorney General, Rob Hulls, has alleged the gift could have been a direct payback for Mr Kennett opening an exclusive BMW dealership at Southbank, in Melbourne, last year.</p>
<p>He's also questioned Mr Kennett's promotion of Crown Casino, saying Crown gives away 250 BMW's a year.</p>
<p>Mr Hulls says BMW paid for the Premier's private suite at this year's Australian Grand Prix, and donated to the Liberal Party at the last State Election.</p>
<p>He's accused Mr Kennett of blatantly using his office for private gain, and says the Premier must explain his role in the BMW Affair.</p>
