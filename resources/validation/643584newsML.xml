<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will visit Tehran from June 16 to 17, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>Newspapers reported that Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan would also hold talks in Tehran from June 9 to 10, but the spokesman could not confirm this.</p>
<p>Sharif will stop in the Iranian capital on his way home from Istanbul, where he is to attend the June 15 summit of the Developing-Eight (D-8) economic cooperation group of Islamic countries, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Relations between Iran and Pakistan, partners in the regional Economic Cooperation Organisation, have been strained by policy differences over their joint neighbour, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Tehran and Islamabad both say they favour U.N. peace efforts aimed at the formation of a broad-based Afghan government including all the ethnic, political and religious groups.</p>
<p>But Iran, deeply suspicious of the purist Islamic Taleban militia that has been ruling Kabul since September, still recognises the ousted government of president Burhanuddin Rabbani.</p>
<p>Pakistan became the first country formally to recognise the Taleban government on May 25. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates swiftly followed Islamabad's lead.</p>
