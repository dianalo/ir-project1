<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin, preparing for heart bypass surgery, has handed his prime minister partial control of several top ministries but kept the nuclear &quot;red button&quot;, the Kremlin said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's order appeared designed partly to curb the ambitions of Alexander Lebed, his national security adviser, who had sought overall charge of key &quot;power ministries&quot;.</p>
<p>Presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said defence, interior and other ministers who usually report directly to the president, would coordinate their activities with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin while Yeltsin is on holiday.</p>
<p>He told Russian news agencies that Chernomyrdin would be able, if necessary, to summon the newly formed Defence Council which comprises top ministers and security supremo Lebed.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, announced in a television interview last week that he would undergo heart surgery at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Speculation was rife on whether he would pass authority to Chernomyrdin, his constitutional deputy.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has officially been on holiday since August 26 and the Kremlin has not announced when his vacation will end.</p>
<p>&quot;President Boris Yeltsin, for the duration of his holiday, has ordered the heads of the power ministries to coordinate with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin all questions that require a decision by the head of state,&quot; Itar-Tass news agency quoted Yastrzhembsky as saying.</p>
<p>They should also keep Yeltsin regularly informed on the matters in their ministries, Yastrzhembsky said.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted him as saying the nuclear &quot;red button&quot; would stay under the control of the Russian leader. It could be activated only by a joint action of the president, the defence minister and the chief-of-staff of the army.</p>
<p>Last year, when Yeltsin was in hospital after a heart attack, Chernomyrdin said he was in control of the power ministries but was later forced to tone down his remarks.</p>
<p>This time he appeared to be taking no chances, playing down his extra responsibilities in comments to Tass and Interfax.</p>
<p>Saying Yeltsin, 65, had shown &quot;complete trust&quot; in announcing to the country and his colleagues his plan to have surgery, Chernomyrdin said he was entitled to good faith in return.</p>
<p>&quot;For me,&quot; he said, &quot;that means the president remains president even during his operation and during the whole course of his treatment. So I see no necessity to discuss the question of the transfer of power, nor for exercises in constructing all sorts of mechanisms to this effect.&quot;</p>
<p>The prime minister, who also said he had sufficient authority of his own to maintain political stability and carry out the president's reform policies, criticised what he called the &quot;scheming fuss&quot; of speculation of the handover of power.</p>
<p>The deputy head of the Kremlin medical team, Yuri Perov, told Interfax the precise date of Yeltsin's operation would be fixed &quot;within just a very few days&quot; by the doctors treating him.</p>
<p>He denied suggestions that the operation, intended to relieve the clogged cardiac arteries which put the president in hospital twice last year, might be postponed to the beginning of October. It was still &quot;on schedule&quot; for the end of this month.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's illness has prompted speculation of a power struggle in the Kremlin and has worried Western leaders, who see Yeltsin as the guarantor of Russia's fledgling democracy.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who met Yeltsin near Moscow on Saturday.</p>
<p>White House Spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton quizzed Kohl about Yeltsin. &quot;The chancellor said Yeltsin was very engaged,&quot; he said. &quot;Obviously (Yeltsin is) concerned about his upcoming medical procedure but looking forward to having it over with.&quot;</p>
<p>Lebed said on Friday the time had come to name Chernomyrdin to rule temporarily. But Kremlin chief of staff Anatoly Chubais, who with Lebed and Chernomyrdin completes a trio of jostling Kremlin rivals, said there was no need to hand over power yet.</p>
