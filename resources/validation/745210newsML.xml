<title>UK: Closing overseas stock market indices.</title>
<headline>Closing overseas stock market indices.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>
<text>
<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Tuesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Stocks rebounded from two days of heavy losses, tracking gains on Wall Street ahead of key testimony on the state of the U.S. economy by Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, due to start after London's close. The FTSE 100 closed at 4,846.7, up 41.0 points, or 0.85 percent.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Germany's IBIS DAX index had another record-breaking day, as merger mania gripped the banking industry after two regional banks set off a feeding frenzy in the sector by announcing a deal Monday. The DAX-30 index made a record close at 4,230.42, up 122.02 points, or 2.97 percent. In later screen-based trade, the IBIS DAX index ended at 4,297.64, up 157.68 points, or 3.81 percent.</p>
<p>PARIS - Stocks closed higher, pulled up by a rally in German stocks which in turn was powered by a banking merger, dealers said. The CAC-40 index closed at 2,921.13, up 47.01 points, or 1.64 percent.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Stocks closed 1 percent higher in modest volume, putting an end to a three-day downward correction. The Swiss market index closed at 5,677.1, up 56.6 points, or 1.01 percent.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks closed moderately lower as recent euphoria was watered down by a pullback in Wall Street high-technology stocks, brokers said. The 225-stock Nikkei average closed at 20,157.02, down 92.30 points, or 0.46 percent.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Stocks deepened losses to close lower as selling in the banking sector increased in late afternoon ahead of Fed Chairman Greenspan's testimony to Congress, brokers said. The Hang Seng index closed at 15,446.78, down 89.52 points, or 0.58 percent.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Stocks firmed from their lows to close slightly stronger as bank stocks in particular rose in sympathy with a mild bond market recovery. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,656.4, up 3.0 points, or 0.11 percent.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Great demand for heavyweight stocks characterised trade on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange with the top 10 trades all heavyweights and making up nearly half of the day's overall 1.3 billion-rand turnover, dealers said. The All-Stock index closed at 7,430.2, down 1.7 points, or 0.02 percent. The All-Gold index closed at 993.2, down 15.0 points, or 1.49 percent, while the Industrial index closed at 8,984.9, up 5.2 points, or 0.06 percent.</p>
