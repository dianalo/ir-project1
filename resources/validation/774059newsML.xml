<p>Car sales in France fell 9.7 percent in July,  the seventh consecutive monthly fall from inflated 1996 levels, but  Renault sales advanced against the trend, the French carmakers' committee  CCFA said on Friday.</p>
<p>CCFA said new car sales fell to 211,747 units from 234,474 in July  1996, when demand was fuelled by a year-long state car buying incentive  scheme.</p>
<p>Correcting for the different number of business days, the fall was  just 5.6 percent, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>PSA Peugeot Citroen car sales in France fell 7.6 percent, but Renault  car sales rose 4.1 percent. The Megane, Clio and Twingo models were  the three best sellers in France last month, a Renault spokesman said.</p>
<p>The Megane five-car family, which includes the hugely popular minivan-styled  Scenic, is France's top seller this year.</p>
<p>The only other sales gain last month was registered by the Japanese,  whose combined sales in France rose 1.3 percent. The biggest losers  in the French market in July were Fiat, whose car sales in France  fell 40 percent, and Volvo, whose sales dropped 29.5 percent.</p>
<p>The biggest losers in the French market in July were Fiat, whose car  sales in France fell 40 percent, and Volvo, whose sales dropped 29.5  percent.</p>
<p>The French carmakers, which had been losing ground on their home market,  held 57.6 percent of the market in July, compared with 55.5 percent  for the January-July period.</p>
<p>For the first seven months of the year, new car sales were down 21.1  percent on the year-ago period at 996,265 units.</p>
<p>French car manufacturers and the CCFA said last month they expected  a 16 percent drop for the year in the French market, which has been  weak since the expiry last September of the new-cars-for-old rebates.</p>
<p>The industry does not expect a reversal in the trend before November,  when the year-over-year comparison will no longer be distorted by  the rebates. But the July sales numbers marked a vast improvement  over June's 30.7 percent plunge.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures are very good. This is the first sign that we're getting  back to normality,&quot; said Salomon Brothers car analyst John Lawson.</p>
<p>&quot;The sales at an annualised rate were 1.95 million, compared with  1.3 million in June, and 1.6 million for the first half. If this rate  is sustained, it would signify a substantial improvement in second  half volumes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shares in French car companies fell on Friday on profit-taking following  recent gains to year highs. PSA Peugeot Citroen's stock was 0.84 percent  lower at 710 francs, while Renault shares dropped 1.28 percent.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the stock price, Swedish carmaker AB Volvo said  on Thursday that it had sold its 11.38 percent stake in Renault, the  remnant of a failed alliance, to Union Bank of Switzerland for $740  million.</p>
