<p>Belgium slid into a government crisis on Tuesday as parliament probed allegations that a deputy prime minister had had sex with under-age boys, adding a new scandal to tales of murder and corruption rocking the country.</p>
<p>A parliamentary commission held a first brief meeting to review the charges against Elio Di Rupo -- who has never denied being a homosexual but says he only ever had sex with consenting adults -- and some party leaders said he may be forced to quit.</p>
<p>The Belgian franc weathered the political storm, with money dealers already writing off Di Rupo and a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene saying the government had ridden out previous crises and would survive this.</p>
<p>The commission, which could take days to reach a conclusion, must decide whether to recommend to parliament to lift Di Rupo's immunity from prosecution and send him to the Cour de Cassation, Belgium's top court and the only one able to judge ministers.</p>
<p>Di Rupo earlier told reporters he had requested the move to enable him to see the allegations against him which he says are baseless and politically motivated.</p>
<p>&quot;I repeat for the umpteenth time that I have never been involved in paedophilia. What is happening now to me really seems like political scheming,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>But Didier Reynders, head of the opposition francophone Liberal party in parliament said: &quot;If parliament refers Di Rupo to the Cassation I do not see how he could...remain in office.&quot;</p>
<p>The new scandal follows a series of unconnected revelations of paedophile abduction, sexual abuse and murder that have shaken Belgium to the core since the arrest in mid-August of convicted rapist Marc Dutroux and the subsequent rescue of two abducted girls and the discovery of the bodies of four more.</p>
<p>Ensuing revelations of police and judicial bungling, incompetence and suggestions of political interference have shattered public confidence in the legal and political system.</p>
<p>&quot;Our regime is out on its feet,&quot; francophone green party member Oliver Deluze told parliament. &quot;What we need is that the secrecy of the judicial investigation is respected as well as that of private lives.&quot;</p>
<p>The parliamentary commission consists of 11 people -- seven from the ruling centre-left coalition and four from opposition parties.</p>
<p>Belgium's coalition government is made up of the francophone and Flemish Christian Democratic and Socialist parties.</p>
<p>Herman de Croo, leader of the main Dutch-speaking opposition VLD Liberals said Di Rupo should quit regardless.</p>
<p>The government of the French-speaking Walloon region also said on Tuesday it had set up an inquiry into Jean-Pierre Grafe, the French Community's minister for higher education, who also faces allegations of under-age sex -- charges he denies.</p>
<p>The parliamentary process instituted against Di Rupo echoes that used against Flemish socialist Willy Claes, forced last year to resign as NATO secretary-general when his immunity was lifted in the face of allegations he knew of a party slush fund in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Political analysts say the government is not under immediate threat, but the key will be whether Flemish and francophone Christian Democrats support Di Rupo or quietly back off.</p>
<p>Their failure to support the socialist politician could spell the eventual end of the coalition, at a time when public confidence in the whole political apparatus and in the socialist parties in particular is already at a very low ebb.</p>
<p>Last month 250,000 people took to the streets of Brussels in a march, originally called to support parents of missing and murdered children, which turned into a show of public disgust with what is seen as Belgium's thoroughly corrupt political and legal system.</p>
