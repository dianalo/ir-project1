<p>The Milan bourse has burst into life after months in the doldrums as foreign and Italian buyers go on a stock buying spree in search of rich pickings.</p>
<p>The MIB30 index, which measures the performance of the top 30 blue-chip stocks on the Milan exchange, closed at 17,136 on Friday up from 15,715 a week earlier, an increase of 9.05 percent.</p>
<p>Driving the surge of enthusiasm has been a realisation by many Italians that, as interest rates steadily come down, they can no longer take for granted the handsome returns they have enjoyed for a generation from investments in treasury paper.</p>
<p>&quot;How long this revival is going to last is hard to say but there is probably a bit of mileage left,&quot; said Marie Christine Keith, an Italian equities specialist at James Capel in London.</p>
<p>The trigger for the latest wave of buying came on Wednesday when Italy's fund management association, Assogestioni, reported that for the first time in two years subscriptions to mutual funds (unit trusts) had outweighed redemptions.</p>
<p>Some market analysts believe this is a long awaited signal that Italian investors -- dubbed in the local press as the &quot;BOT people&quot; because of their predilection for treasury bills known as BOTs -- are looking to the stock market as an alternative.</p>
<p>The Milan bourse has traditionally been seen as a haven for insiders where small savers are contemptuosly referred to as the &quot;bullock herd&quot;. Many Italians are still wary of equity investments.</p>
<p>But the arrival over the past year of privatisation stocks such as energy giant ENI and a stream of new listings is starting to change the landscape.</p>
<p>The bourse is still given to long periods of despondency interspersed by fitful bursts of heady growth which often collapse as quickly as they have started.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the features of the Italian market is that it is prone to abrupt changes of sentiment with wild price movements,&quot; said Andrea Azzimondi, Italian equities analyst at CSFB in London.</p>
<p>But there are strong grounds for believing the stock market may have quite a bit further to climb before there is a shake-out. &quot;The Italian stock market is looking cheap from a historical perspective and compared to other European markets,&quot; said Azzimondi.</p>
<p>Azzimondi said the outlook for liquidity was particularly favourable for shares with the ratio of bond yields to dividend yields at its lowest level in recent memory.</p>
<p>The prospective price/earnings ratio for equities in Italy -- one of the most closely watched measures of investment value -- was 13.9 at the beginning of the week compared with 18.1 in France, 17.6 in Germany and 16.3 in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Another signal to buy came from chart analysts who said the closely watched BCI index breached a key resistance level of 660 on January 3. It has since risen to 710.26 at Friday's close and analysts believe it could rise to 720 before pausing.</p>
<p>Among stocks which have risen sharpest in recent days, has been car giant Fiat, which put on strong gains after a jump in December car sales in Italy was announced on Friday.</p>
<p>Fiat finished 8.71 percent higher at 4,816 lire, the strongest performance by a major blue chip stock.</p>
<p>Investors appeared to shrug off an announcement on Thursday by the car producer that it was recalling 80,000 of its Bravo/Brava saloon models to replace a small brake component.</p>
<p>Insurance companies such as Generali and Alleanza have also enjoyed a revival after weeks in the doldrums although share analysts believe they are expensive by international comparisons.</p>
<p>Telecommunications stocks such as state group Stet, Telecom Italia, and utilities such as Italgas have also attracted investors.</p>
