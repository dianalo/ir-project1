<title>THAILAND: General Finance tops stock active list.</title>
<headline>General Finance tops stock active list.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1996-11-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>General Finance and Securities Plc topped the active stock list on Wednesday afternoon on market speculation that its chief executive would be named a cabinet minister, analysts said.</p>
<p>Traders said General Finance shares were actively traded on reports that the firm's chairman Narongchai Akrasanee would be made deputy finance minister.  </p>
<p>About 2.37 million General Finance shares were traded by late on Wednesday. The stock was unchanged at 57 baht at 0915 GMT.</p>
<p>General Finance is one of three successful applicants for new bank licences. But the process for government approval to start a banking business was delayed by the collapse of Banharn Silpa-archa's government in September.</p>
<p>Caretaker defence minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh on Wednesday was negotiating with political partners on sharing cabinet jobs in his six-party coalition, which controls a majority in the lower House of Representatives after Sunday's general election.</p>
<p>Narongchai is an adviser to caretaker deputy premier Amnuay Viravan, who is widely tipped to be the new finance minister.</p>
<p>Amnuay has said he may recruit Narongchai, probably as a cabinet adviser. Narongchai said on Tuesday he did not expect to be included in the cabinet, but described himself as an insider.</p>
