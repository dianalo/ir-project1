<p>Greece's socialist Prime Minister Costas Simitis and his new cabinet were sworn in on Wednesday by President Costis Stephanopoulos at the start of their four-year term.</p>
<p>In a televised ceremony, black-clad Orthodox priests chanted a blessing for the new government and Simitis then swore an oath of office. He was followed by his new government's 42 ministers and deputy ministers.  </p>
<p>Simitis, 60, won Sunday's national election and has formed a cabinet which mixes experienced ministers with a new generation of reformers who helped to put him in power.</p>
<p>He succeeded party founder and legend Andreas Papandreou as prime minister in January. Simitis gambled on an early vote to cement his grip on power and to choose his own cabinet.</p>
<p>The ceremony marks the start of the post-Papandreou era, with a new generation leader and his hand-picked cabinet setting a firmly pro-Western course and turning thier back on Papandreou's unpredictable, anti-Western ways.</p>
