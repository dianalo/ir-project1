<p>Alliance Gaming Corp said Tuesday it expects to report a &quot;large loss&quot; for its fiscal fourth quarter, ended June 30, after accounting for its merger with Bally Gaming International Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;While revenues for the business units showed positive trends, and we anticipate operating results of the business units will meet our expectations, the company anticipates reporting a large loss for the quarter,&quot; Scott Schweinfurth, chief financial officer, said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Alliance Gaming expects to issue its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and year in mid-September.</p>
<p>&quot;We anticipate that our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for direct merger costs and unusual items, will be within our range of expectations for the 1996 fourth quarter,&quot; said Steve Greathouse, chief executive officer..</p>
<p>&quot;Management is comfortable that its previously disclosed anticipated operating results for the calendar year ending December 31, 1996 are on track,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Though it will report a loss for the quarter, Alliance Gaming said the acquired businesses are performing better than the company anticipated.</p>
<p>&quot;The new business units acquired from BGII performed above our expectations for the quarter,&quot; Greathouse said.</p>
<p>He added the company is &quot;very pleased&quot; with growth in its casino business unit and parts of gaming machine management.</p>
<p>Alliance Gaming said Bally Gaming's business saw a 12 percent increase in unit shipments in the fourth quarter to 6,400 units from 5,700 units in the year ago quarter.</p>
<p>German operations saw a 10 percent decline in the number of new wall machine units sold in the fourth quarter versus one year ago.</p>
<p>The company said its market share continued to increase at the Rainbow Casino in Vicksburg, Miss., and a 346-machine expansion of the new &quot;Gamblers Bonus&quot; device offset an overall decline in revenues in non-Gamblers Bonus gaming devices.</p>
<p>Louisian-based Video Services Inc saw its win per day per gaming device rise to $76.94 in 1996's fourth quarter versus $59.39, one year ago.</p>
