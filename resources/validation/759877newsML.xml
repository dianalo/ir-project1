<headline>Tokyo naphtha gains, South Korea offers Aug LSWR.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-07-28</dateline>

<p>Tokyo naphtha prices were higher in afternoon trade on Monday, following Friday's overseas crude oil gains, although the regional supply/demand equation remained in buyers' favour, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some spot requirements here and there, but all in all Asia's fundamentals are still on the weak side,&quot; one naphtha trader said.</p>
<p>Open-spec naphtha, Asia's benchmark forward contract, was bid at $209.50 per tonne for first-half October delivery, while offers were heard at $211.00. It was traded at $208.00 on Friday.  </p>
<p>In inter-month naphtha spreads, second-half September/second-half October was quoted at minus 50 cents/even. It changed hands at minus 50 cents on Friday.</p>
<p>A South Korean refiner said it had about 200,000 barrels of low sulphur waxy residue (LSWR) to sell for August.</p>
<p>The oil firm said its target price for the straight-run cargo was $1.50 per barrel over the mean of Singapore quotes, while potential buyers in Japan said it would be traded at around a $1.00 premium at best.</p>
<p>Japan or China was likely to be the buyer of the Korean cargo due to geographical proximity, they said.</p>
