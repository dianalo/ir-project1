<p>President Lee Teng-hui on Tuesday thanked retired U.S. military chief Colin Powell for supporting U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, saying Washington should not compromise Taiwan despite its ties with China.</p>
<p>The visiting Powell, said by some to be considering a run for the White House in 2000, told Lee that Washington maintained a policy of ensuring Taiwan's safety amid the island's volatile relations with China, its longtime adversary.</p>
<p>&quot;I express sincere gratitude for (Powell's) concern for...the situation across the Taiwan Strait, especially in assisting our country to buy defensive weapons,&quot; Lee was quoted by aides as telling Powell.</p>
<p>&quot;We can understand the United States engaging in exchanges with communist China, but we also expect that the United States should not neglect the safety and welfare of Taiwan's 21.3 million people,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>In 1993, Washington rebuffed fierce protests from China and agreed to sell 150 F-16 fighter planes to Taiwan.</p>
<p>Washington has approved several subsequent military deals with Taiwan, including the sale of Patriot anti-missile missiles made famous during the 1991 Gulf War overseen by Powell.</p>
<p>Taiwan was preparing to take delivery of the advanced jet fighters and has begun installing Patriot batteries to defend against China's medium-range ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>China, which has viewed Taiwan as a rebel-held province since a civil war split them in 1949, has warned other countries not to forge diplomatic ties with Taipei or sell arms to Taiwan.</p>
<p>Beijing launched eight months of war games and unarmed missile tests near Taiwan after Lee made a private visit to New York in 1995 -- a journey China interpreted as an attempt to promote Taiwan's independence.</p>
<p>The last round of the manoeuvres, occurring in the run-up to Taiwan's presidential election in March 1996, prompted the U.S. to deploy two aircraft carrier groups to the region -- its biggest armada in the region since the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Washington switched official ties to Beijing from Taipei in 1979, but maintains the right to arm Taiwan -- and even defend the island if necessary.</p>
<p>Powell, who ended a two-day visit to Taiwan on Tuesday, said Washington's policy towards Taiwan would not change despite pressure from Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S.'s policy has always been to express concern for Taiwan and to ensure Taiwan's safety,&quot; Powell told Lee.</p>
<p>He urged Nationalist-ruled Taiwan to continue fostering private exchanges with China to &quot;spread the message of freedom and democracy into the hearts of the mainland people&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The result of this will definitely have a corrosive effect on the communist system,&quot; the 59-year-old retired general said.</p>
<p>Taipei, which has transformed an authoritarian regime into a thriving democracy in the past 10 years, says it would agree to re-unite with China only after Beijing undergoes political liberalisation.</p>
<p>&quot;We seek the country's reunification under a system of freedom, democracy and mutual prosperity,&quot; Lee told Powell. &quot;This is our principle and our unchanging stance.&quot;</p>
