<p>St. Jude Medical Inc's vice president of corporate relations, Peter Gove, said that the company was comfortable with analysts' estimates for the fourth quarter of $0.45 to $0.52 per share, minus the impact of acquisitions.</p>
<p>&quot;This is with the important caveat that the range is pre-Teletronics,&quot; he told Reuters on Wednesday, after a presentation at the Robertson Stephens &amp; Co-sponsored medical conference in New York.  </p>
<p>The company announced in October that it had agreed to buy Telectronics Pacing Systems Inc from Pacific Dunlop Ltd. The acquisition is expected to close before the end of the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Frank Fischer of Ventritex Inc, which agreed to merge with St. Jude's Pacesetter unit in October, said during the presentation that the company expects to receive marketing approval for one of its single defibrillator leads -- the SPL or single pass lead -- in the second quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>He said approval for the HVC -- high voltage can -- single lead system was obtained in November, and approval for the dual transvenous lead system was received in May.</p>
<p>Ventritex makes contour implantable defibrillators, which are electronic devices implanted in the body and connected by lead wires to the heart to regulate its rhythm.</p>
<p>Fischer told the conference that the implantable defibrillator market is growing by 20 to 25 percent annually, and will go from an estimated $750 million in 1996 to close to $1.7 billion in 2000.</p>
<p>He also said that Ventritex planned to expand its international operations, with Germany constituting the main focus.</p>
