<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he hoped an Arab-Israeli summit called by U.S. President Bill Clinton would lead to accelerated peace talks with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>But Netanyahu said the issue of a controversial Jerusalem tunnel, whose opening by Israel near Moslem holy sites touched off violence that has claimed 69 lives, would not be on his agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to achieve two things in this meeting: a renewed commitment to end violence and renewed acceleration of the peace process,&quot; Netanyahu said in an interview with Israeli television stations.</p>
<p>In an announcement on the White House lawn on Sunday, Clinton said he hoped to convene a summit this week following violence that has claimed 69 lives.</p>
<p>Asked on CNN if he would close the tunnel, after vowing in a speech on Saturday to keep it open, Netanyahu said: &quot;I don't know, would you tear down the Washington monument or stop the Vietnam Memorial if somebody says they have a problem with it?&quot;</p>
<p>He said the tunnel is &quot;not on my table and it won't be on my table&quot;.</p>
<p>Palestinian cabinet minister Nabil Shaath, also interviewed by CNN, called the archaeological passageway a change of the status quo in Arab East Jerusalem, which the PLO wants as the capital of a future Palestinian state.</p>
<p>&quot;It must be closed,&quot; Shaath said.</p>
<p>Israel views the eastern sector of Jerusalem, captured in the 1967 Middle East war, as part of its &quot;united and eternal&quot; capital. Netanyahu has said he was exercising what he called the Jewish state's sovereignty over all of the city by opening the tunnel.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's cabinet secretary, Danny Naveh, said no prior understandings were reached before Israel agreed to attend the White House summit.</p>
<p>&quot;There are none...There is only one understanding, that we're going to Washington,&quot; Naveh told Israel's Channel One television.</p>
<p>Netanyahu declined in the interview to spell out the shape of any future peace talks with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>&quot;The technicalities are interesting but less important than the principle of first stopping the violence and then speeding up the discussions between the Palestinians and us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been stalled since Netanayahu won the Israeli elections in May.</p>
<p>PLO officials said Palestinian President Yasser Arafat had not officially replied to the U.S. invitation. He wanted Egypt's Hosni Mubarak to attend the summit but the Egyptian leader has not said whether he will attend.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an invitation by Mr Clinton. It has not arrived officially and we will make a decision once we receive it,&quot; Shaath told reporters.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's office said the prime minister would leave for Washington on Monday for meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday with Clinton, Jordan's King Hussein, Arafat and Mubarak, if he attends.</p>
<p>Asked Washington's view of the fate of the Jerusalem tunnel which sparked the violence, U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk told Israel Radio: &quot;We are not going before this meeting to get into particular issues.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked whether he expected the summit to end with a detailed timetable for Israel's long-delayed redeployment from Hebron, Indyk said: &quot;It's very difficult now to speculate about what the outcome will be and I am not going to do that and I hope you'll understand that.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said the involvement of Palestinian policemen in gun battles with Israeli soldiers last week made achieving security modifications of the partial pullout agreement even more important to protect some 400 Jewish settlers in Hebron.</p>
