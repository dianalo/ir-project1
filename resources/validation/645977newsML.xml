<p>Two people were killed and around 40 injured after a freak powerful storm battered the Netherlands, capsizing boats, uprooting trees and disrupting train services, Dutch media said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The storm, packing force 10 winds and lashing rain, broke suddenly on Saturday afternoon in the south-west of the country. It swiftly moved northeastwards, reaching Amsterdam and leaving a trail of destruction across the country.</p>
<p>Dutch television showed pictures of houses with roofs blown off, cars and caravans upturned, and trees felled by the ferocious winds.</p>
<p>A woman drowned in the huge inland IJsselmeer lake, just north of Amsterdam, where the majority of boating accidents were reported. A spokesman for the Dutch coastguard described the situation as chaotic, with many capsized vessels.</p>
<p>Coastguard boats and helicopters were alerted to rescue people thrown overboard in more than 100 separate incidents. Many of those in trouble were windsurfers, enjoying what had been a hot summer's day.</p>
<p>&quot;We were very fortunate, although the material damage was quite high, the casualties could have been much worse,&quot; the spokesman said on Sunday. &quot;We put a rescue plan into action that was developed after a similar storm in 1983.&quot;</p>
<p>He confirmed a woman's body had been found in the lake and that there were three people still unaccounted for, although he said they had almost certainly been picked up by one of the many private vessels that helped with the rescue effort.</p>
<p>In Velsen, on the coast east of Amsterdam, a 72-year old man died overnight from injuries caused by a falling tree.</p>
<p>In other parts of the country, trains were severely disrupted and traffic across the main bridge in the port city of Rotterdam stopped due to an overturned car. Witnesses there reported debris and uprooted trees littering the streets.</p>
<p>Rotterdam was particularly badly affected. &quot;We have a few people injured by falling trees but nothing more serious. A few also fell overboard from boats that capsized but thankfully we have recovered them all,&quot; a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>At Rotterdam airport four small planes were badly damaged by the high winds. An airport spokesman said the planes were grounded at the time and international traffic was unaffected.</p>
<p>At the country's main Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, planes were slightly delayed but there was no damage.</p>
<p>The high winds uprooted trees across the country. In the southwestern town of Bergen-op-Zoom, 21 people were injured, when a marquee collapsed.</p>
