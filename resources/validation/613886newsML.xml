<headline>Jakarta stocks end firmer on bargain hunting.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-05-26</dateline>

<p>Bargain-hunting in blue chip counters led by Telkom raised Jakarta's stock index by the close on Monday but overall volume was light, brokers said.</p>
<p>The composite index rose 4.67 points, or 0.71 percent, to 663.20 points after touching a low of 658.05 points in early trade. Advancers led decliners 61 to 43, with 75 counters unchanged.</p>
<p>Total turn-over was modest, estimated at about 280 billion rupiah compared to about 326 billion rupiah last Friday.  </p>
<p>The LQ45 index -- representing the 45 very liquid counters on the Jakarta bourse -- closed 0.84 percent, or 1.14 points, higher at 136.38 points.</p>
<p>A broker with a Malaysian firm said he expected trading to remain slow on Tuesday but added the index may moving upward as more bargain hunters were likely to enter the market.</p>
<p>Brokers ascribed the slow trading on Monday to a holiday on Wall Street and also news of the riot in Banjarmasin, a city in South Kalimantan province in Borneo island, but said the impact was minor as it was far away from Jakarta.  </p>
<p>&quot;Trading will remain slow up to the end of this month, until the (May 29) election is over, I guess. The market will be normal again next June because of some initial public offerings will take place,&quot; the broker said. &quot;At the same time, many companies will announce their first quarter results,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Cement maker Semen Gresik and Bank Negara Indonesia were among the targets of bargain hunters, brokers said.</p>
<p>Small property firm Mas Murni Indonesia was the most active stock, rising 50 rupiah to 925 on 13.7 million shares on what brokers said was due to revived speculation of a possible take-over and rights issue.</p>
