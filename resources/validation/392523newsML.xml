<p>Taiwan's Presidential Office sent its condolences to the family of China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping on Thursday and urged a &quot;peaceful, cooperative, prosperous new era&quot; between Taipei and Beijing.</p>
<p>But the island, which Beijing regards as a renegade province, maintained a military alert and advised its people to stay calm.</p>
<p>&quot;Regarding Mr Deng Xiaoping's death, we hereby express our condolences to his family,&quot; Huang Kun-hui, secretary-general of Taiwan's Presidential Office, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Huang praised Deng for launching economic reforms on the mainland which enhanced trade ties between Taiwan and China.</p>
<p>&quot;Ever since Mr Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms, Taiwan's private sector has provided funds, technology and manpower to inject new life into mainland's economic development and raise its living standard,&quot; Huang said.</p>
<p>Taiwan analysts said jitters over the news of Deng's death late on Wednesday and concerns over political stability on the mainland would keep the markets jumpy.</p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar fell and share prices were expected to follow suit, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar opened lower at T$27.630 versus Wednesday's T$27.583 close.</p>
<p>&quot;The (stock) market will fall between 100-150 points,&quot; said David Yu, vice president for International Investment Trust Co.</p>
<p>Wu Hui-lin, senior economist at Chunghua Institution for Economic Research, said: &quot;The market will fluctuate for a while to watch China's post-Deng development, but the impact won't be big as the market has reacted to Deng's death rumours several times before.&quot;</p>
<p>Finance minister Paul Chiu, who told the state-funded Central News Agency that he was &quot;not a bit surprised&quot; by Deng's death, was optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;The news of Deng's deteriorating health had been circulating for a long time, the day (of his death) was expected,&quot; Chiu told the state news agency.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the stock market will not plunge,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Taiwan media quoted military spokesman Kung Fan-ting as saying that the armed forces were on alert for any latest developments, but added the military had not yet raised its alert level.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation on the mainland is likely to change, the armed forces will actively follow the current situation there,&quot; Kung said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's unlikely the communist armed forces will make unusual movements in the near term,&quot; Kung was quoted by local media as adding.</p>
<p>Shi Hwei-you, vice-chairman of the cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council, said he hoped people would treat Deng's death calmly. The council formulates Taiwan's policies towards China.</p>
<p>&quot;The government already has policies for post-Deng period. It will not change the policies,&quot; Shi told Reuters by telephone. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Taiwan and China have been diplomatic rivals since a Chinese civil war split them in 1949. Beijing regards the island as a renegade province and refuses to rule out the use of force to retake Taiwan.</p>
<p>China's military held war games off the island in the run up to presidential elections in March last year in an exercise seen as trying to intimidate Taiwanese voters against voting for independence.</p>
<p>China's paramount leader died late on Wednesday of complications from Parkinson's disease and a lung infection, the offical Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>The announcement of Deng's death was made in a letter to the Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army and the people of various ethnic groups throughout China, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>Deng died at 21:08 p.m. (1308 GMT) at the age of 92, Xinhua said.</p>
