<p>U.S. retailers on the whole rang up surprisingly strong December sales despite the disappointing results reported by many stores after Christmas, economists said.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 0.6 percent in December after a revised 0.2 percent decline in November.</p>
<p>&quot;It was suprisingly strong in view of the fact there were fewer shopping days this year compared to last year,&quot; said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Chase Regional Bank.  </p>
<p>&quot;The retailers themselves weren't all that pleased with the way sales went,&quot; Kellner added.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters forecast sales to rise 0.5 percent in December, following an originally reported 0.4 percent decline in November.</p>
<p>Sales were strong in many categories.  Heavy holiday traffic through apparel stores, which tallied up sales 1.5 percent better than in November, was well telegraphed by anecdotal evidence before the data, economists said.</p>
<p>But a 0.5 percent increase in durable goods purchases and a 0.7 percent auto sales jump came as a pleasant surprise.  </p>
<p>&quot;(Those items) were expected to hold the number down a bit; instead it looks like they lifted it a little above expectations,&quot; said Gary Thayer, senior economist at AG Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.</p>
<p>The exclusion of auto sales figures did not alter the retail number, leaving sales up 0.6 percent in December after a revised flat ex-autos reading in November.</p>
<p>Economists were expecting a 0.4 percent increase in sales, after autos were subtracted.</p>
<p>The car sales increase was slightly better than suggested by the sales numbers reported from Detroit, Kellner said.  </p>
<p>&quot;You also had an increase (0.8 percent) in sales at gasoline service stations, but this is probably nothing more than higher prices, rather then people traveling and driving more, so you might want to discount that,&quot; said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.</p>
<p>The sales data were consistent with healthy economic activity in the fourth quarter of last year, economists said.</p>
<p>But they said the picture emerging from the final three months of 1996 was that of an economy growing at or just slightly above the economy's long-term, non-inflationary sustainable growth rate.  </p>
<p>Economists said the relatively robust retail sales data increase the odds that the Federal Reserve will opt to tighten credit in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>But Moran said the Fed will probably refrain from changing monetary policy when its policymakers next gather to discuss interest rates on February 4 and 5.</p>
