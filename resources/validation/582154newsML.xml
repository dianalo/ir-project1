<p>Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski on Wednesday signed into law a draft of the new energy bill, which introduces elements of free market into the sector and paves the way for its privatisation.</p>
<p>&quot;The president signed the new energy law,&quot; the president's press office said in a statement.</p>
<p>The bill, due to become effective in six months, abandons communist-era regulations, which protected energy producers from bankruptcy and gave the industry ministry direct supervision over them.</p>
<p>It provides for setting up the Energy Regulation Office (URE) to award licences for electricity producers and set official electricity prices.</p>
<p>All licensed electricity producers would have equal access to the state-owned power grid which so far has been open only to large state-owned power companies. Foreign producers would not have an automatic access to the grid.</p>
<p>The industry ministry said last year that electricity prices could be freed within two years from the implementation of the energy law.</p>
<p>The bill also introduces competition to the sector by creating an auction system for electricity supply contracts, in which largest power plants would participate.</p>
<p>Under the current system consumers buy electricity from the nearest producer for a price set by the finance minister.</p>
<p>The draft law would also pave the way for regional diversification of electricity prices, depending on costs of its delivery.</p>
<p>Government officials have said that the new energy law would open the way for the privatisatisation of the sector.</p>
<p>Former Industry Minister Klemens Scierski said in September that by the year 2000 all smaller power and heating plants should be privatised as well as some of larger power stations.</p>
<p>The privatisation would be carried out through flotations or through sales of minority or majority stakes in power plants to investors, domestic or foreign.</p>
<p>Poland's energy sector, employing 120,000 people, generates about five percent of Poland's gross domestic product forecasted at 427 billion zlotys this year.</p>
