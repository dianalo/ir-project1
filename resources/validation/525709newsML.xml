<p>NWE gas oil had a quiet but firm start to the week with premiums for certain grades a touch easier, but largely offset by stronger futures.</p>
<p>May IPE gas oil was trading $1.00 a tonne stronger at $164.25 at 1100 GMT, primarily on the back of firmer NYMEX prices in overnight ACCESS trading.</p>
<p>Heating oil barge premiums were a touch easier, by 25-59 cents, with prompt Rotterdam refinery material offered at May IPE +75 cents to +$1 fob. Traders said spot demand was slow, with interest into Germany particularly weak.</p>
<p>Diesel barge premiums were steady with a small parcel of Rotterdam refinery material heard done in the morning at May IPE +$10 fob. Product remains tight.</p>
<p>&quot;I have only heard Antwerp offered at May IPE +$9-9.50,&quot; said one barge trader.</p>
<p>Cargo premiums were broadly steady, although there was talk of easing numbers for FOD, the market for which has been very quiet.</p>
<p>Dealers said DIN was heard bid May IPE +$3 cif NWE with offers hovering around the $4.50 level. &quot;FOD has been slow, but still notionally stronger than DIN so its probably around May IPE +$4-5,&quot; said one trader at a major.</p>
<p>EN590 was the grade the market was looking for and premiums were seen around May IPE +$10.50 cif NWE, a touch easier than last week.</p>
<p>&quot;That may just be a Monday thing, because the fundamentals have not changed over the weekend,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
