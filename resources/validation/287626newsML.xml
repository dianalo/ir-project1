<headline>Travolta, Cruise share honors at U.S. box office.</headline>
<dateline>LOS ANGELES 1997-01-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>In a weekend that saw no new national releases at the box office, the top spot was shared by two of Hollywood's most bankable stars, John Travolta with &quot;Michael&quot; and Tom Cruise with &quot;Jerry Maguire,&quot; according to studio estimates released on Sunday.</p>
<p>Each movie grossed an estimated $12.5 million during the Friday-to-Sunday period. Rising two places to third was the emsemble slasher picture &quot;Scream,&quot; while &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; and &quot;One Fine Day&quot; took fourth and fifth, respectively.</p>
<p>The one new entry to the top 10 was &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot; at seventh place.</p>
<p>The critically savaged movie about the murder of civil rights activist Medgar Evers widened to 1,268 screens from 21 the weekend, before when it was 29th. The Rob Reiner-directed picture is released by Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp.</p>
<p>Both &quot;Michael&quot; and &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; suffered relatively tiny drops from the weekend before, when &quot;Michael&quot; opened in first with $17.4 million. &quot;Michael&quot; fell 28 percent, while &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; slipped 11 percent, the smallest decline in the top 10.</p>
<p>&quot;Michael,&quot; which is released by New Line Cinema, a unit of Time Warner Inc., has earned $53.6 million since opening on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>&quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; is now up to $83.4 million since it opened in first during the Dec. 13-15 weekend. The romantic comedy starring Cruise as an aggressive sports agent is released by Sony's TriStar Pictures banner.</p>
<p>&quot;Scream,&quot; directed by Wes Craven and starring Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox, has emerged as one of the surprise hits of the holiday period.</p>
<p>Its gross rose 10 percent for the weekend to $10 million, giving it a 17-day total of $39.1 million. The movie is released by Miramax Films, a unit of Walt Disney Co..</p>
<p>&quot;Scream&quot; averaged $5,777 from 1,731 screens, the highest average in the top 10. By contrast, &quot;Michael&quot; averaged $5,731 and &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; $4,939, both respectable tallies.</p>
<p>These averages were left in the dust, however, by several highly praised movies playing in limited release.</p>
<p>With a weekend gross of $1.1 million, &quot;Evita&quot; averaged $50,000 from 22 screens and &quot;The People Vs. Larry Flynt&quot; earned $600,000 from 16 screens, giving it an average of $37,500.</p>
<p>&quot;Evita&quot; is released by Disney, while &quot;Flynt&quot; is handled by Columbia Pictures.</p>
<p>Disney's &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; slipped a notch to fourth with $7.4 million. Its 40-day total is $121.8 million.</p>
<p>&quot;One Fine Day,&quot; an under-performing romantic comedy starring Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney, gained one place to fifth with $6.8 million. Its 17-day total is $34.8 million.</p>
<p>The movie is released by 20th Century Fox, a unit of News Corp.</p>
