<p>Gilts look technically stronger after recent consolidation and a break above 115-00 should be the trigger for a further push higher, technical analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>September gilts set a contract high at 115-05 on July 2, a high of 115-02 on July 7, and a high of 115-00 on July 11.</p>
<p>&quot;Gilts are stuck in a strait-jacket of 115-00 and 114-00,&quot; said a technical analyst at a European bank in London. &quot;On balance it looks bullish and a close above 115-00 should be worth a point-and-a-half.&quot;</p>
<p>September gilt futures were up 5/32 at 114-19 by 0705 GMT.  </p>
<p>While the momentum remained neutral, with the 14-day Relative Strength Index at around 56 percent, the analyst said a break out of a triangle formation at the beginning of July had yet to fulfill its potential.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to sit with the positive,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a bit of a test of patience, but it should be worth it.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the positive picture would be negated if the market closed below 114-00, which would target the 112-16 area.</p>
<p>Initial support was placed at 114-09/10, the middle of the range traded on Wednesday. Analysts at HSBC Futures said a break of 113-24 would open the way to trendline support at 113-14.  </p>
<p>A trendline joining the lows of 112-02 on May 22, 112-05 on May 28 and 112-25 on June 24 comes in around the 113-14 area.</p>
<p>According to HSBC, penetrations of this would confirm the bearish arguments, targeting 112-00 over a relatively short period.</p>
<p>December short sterling futures were up 0.02 at 92.66. The European bank analyst said the market has stabilised, and is gearing up for a push to the upside.</p>
