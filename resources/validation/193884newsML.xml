<p>By Nicholas Doughty, Diplomatic Correspondent</p>
<p>The Philippines senator who wants to lead the United Nations into the 21st century said on Friday it was time for a woman to have the job and urged big powers like the United States to face their responsibilities.</p>
<p>Senator Leticia Ramos Shahani is so far the only declared candidate to replace Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the end of this year, if the United States vetoes his bid for a second term as expected.</p>
<p>Shahani, 67, said she would not press her case if another African candidate were selected by the U.N. Security Council to replace the veteran Egyptian diplomat, but she would be ready to step in if there were a deadlock.</p>
<p>&quot;Time is short...There's a lot of talk about reform in the United Nations. We feel that a qualified woman would be a good person to bring about the needed reforms,&quot; she told Reuters in an interview at the World Food Summit in Rome.</p>
<p>No woman has held the U.N.'s top job since the organisation was founded in 1945, although Irish President Mary Robinson and former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland have been mentioned as possible candidates.</p>
<p>Shahani, the sister of Philippines President Fidel Ramos, said she hoped Asian nations would back her candidacy but said none had given commitments as yet.</p>
<p>&quot;No one is really taking a position because everyone is waiting to see how things will be between Boutros-Ghali and the Security Council,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The U.S. pledge to use its Security Council power and veto Boutros-Ghali for a second five-year term annoyed many of Washington's allies and partners.</p>
<p>Washington, which may exercise the veto as early as next week during consultations in New York, says it wants someone more committed to reform.</p>
<p>Shahani, who has served as a diplomat and worked in senior U.N. positions, said one of her priorities would be to improve the tarnished image of the 185-nation organisation.</p>
<p>Crippled financially and accused of waste and mismanagement, the United Nations has also taken the blame for peacekeeping failures in Bosnia and Somalia.</p>
<p>&quot;There has to be a major attempt to make people realise the U.N. is their organisation,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Shahani said she would work with the United States, the biggest financial contributor, to meet its concerns about reform. But she said Washington should pay the debt of more than $1 billion it owes the United Nations.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't use the podium and then not pay your dues...I think arrears should be paid,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>While Washington has said it wants someone who is more of an administrator for the job, Shahani said she saw a firmly independent diplomatic role for the U.N. chief.</p>
<p>She said major powers should not make either the secretary-general or the organisation the scapegoat for failures in, for example, peacekeeping.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a mixed record. When operations fail they tend to blame the secretary-general...What I'm saying is that it is the member states who decide,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Shahani declined comment on highly sensitive questions about the reform of U.N. institutions like the Security Council but said her priorities would include sorting out U.N. finances, the limits of peacekeeping, as well as development and social issues.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very tough job, a difficult balancing act,&quot; she said. &quot;I guess you have to go into it knowing you won't be getting bouquets or chocolates.&quot;</p>
