<title>UK: Betrayal budget to deter investment in UK - Lilley.</title>
<headline>Betrayal budget to deter investment in UK - Lilley.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-02</dateline>

<p>Opposition Conservative treasury spokesman Peter Lilley on Wednesday described the budget as a &quot;betrayal of trust&quot; which would deter foreign firms from investing in Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;Tony Blair told the electorate to trust him on tax. A few weeks later he needs billions of pounds from tax rises...it is a betrayal of trust,&quot; Lilley told reporters in parliament.</p>
<p>Lilley said the decision by Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown to abolish advance corporation tax would strip British companies of investment funds and greatly reduce the chances of attracting inward investment.</p>
<p>&quot;It removes the relative advantage of investing in Britain against investing abroad,&quot; Lilley said. &quot;One of the first moves of a Labour Chancellor is to encourage overseas investment to the detriment of British investment.&quot;</p>
<p>Lilley said the ACT move dwarfed the advantage to British companies of the two point cut in corporation to 31 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Companies as a whole will be worse off, and in the short term they will be very much worse off as they have to top up their pension funds,&quot; Lilley said. &quot;They will not have that money available for investment.&quot;  </p>
<p>Lilley said Brown should have used monetary rather than fiscal policy to address inflationary and cyclical pressures in the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea that you can manipulate short-term movements in the economy by fiscal policies is long since discredited,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He accused Brown of raising taxes at a time when he could falsely blame the outgoing government for creating the need to do so in order to have fund to increase government spending later in the parliament.  </p>
<p>Lilley said it was a dangerous strategy to raid the reserves to raise spending on education and the health service, leaving only 2.8 billion stg for emergencies.</p>
<p>&quot;It is certainly an uncomfortable position for a Chancellor to have so little left,&quot; he said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 5427767</p>
