<p>U.S. envoy Dennis Ross will leave the Middle East on Wednesday night to brief President Bill Clinton on progress in Israel-PLO peace talks and will return to the region next week, an official close to the talks said.</p>
<p>The official, who refused to be identified, said Ross would meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in Ramallah before flying home as Israeli and PLO negotiators continued to iron out remaining disputes.</p>
<p>In Hebron, Israeli troops scuffled with Jewish settlers opposed to any withdwrawal from the volatile town.</p>
<p>Witnesses said police arrested about 20 Jewish settlers after an illegal pre-dawn attempt to take over two vacant houses in Hebron's Arab casbah. Soldiers and police removed the settlers from the homes.</p>
<p>Unrest spread to the rooftops and the streets where settlers hurled eggs, apples and stones at Israeli soldiers, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Hebron's Jews are angry that a U.S.-brokered Israeli-PLO summit made progress on Tuesday towards a long-overdue Israeli transfer of 80 percent of the town holy to Moslems and Jews to Arafat's Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>One American official said the sides were &quot;cleaning up remaining issues in the text&quot; of a Hebron accord and Israeli and PLO sources said a deal could be reached within a week but senior officials on both sides declined comment.</p>
<p>&quot;There are all kinds of estimates. Right now we need to work and complete the job,&quot; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policy adviser Dore Gold told Israel radio.</p>
<p>Military sources said three firebombs were thrown at Israeli army and police positions in Hebron near the enclaves where 400 Jews live amidst 100,000 Arabs in the city's heart.</p>
<p>Hebron, taken by Israel with the rest of the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war, is the last Palestinian town due for self-rule under a 1995 peace deal. Israel's security fears have delayed its transfer.</p>
<p>Hebron's settlers feel betrayed by Netanyahu, a rightist backer of Jewish settlement in occupied lands who has nonetheless promised to uphold the Hebron deal signed by the left-leaning government he ousted in May.</p>
<p>The Jews say they would expand their community but the government prevents them from buying property and limits them to building only in existing Jewish neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>In the autonomous Gaza Strip, Jewish settlers laid a ceremonial cornerstone for what they said would be a new neighbourhood in the Israeli-ruled enclave of Netzarim in reaction to the planned opening of road near the settlement to Palestinian traffic.</p>
<p>&quot;Opening that road to Palestinians will endanger the settlement,&quot; Netzarim spokesman Shlomo Kostiner told Reuters.</p>
<p>Palestinian security officials said the road, closed to Arab traffic after an Islamist suicide bomber on a bicycle blew himself up on it in 1994, would be reopened on Thursday.</p>
<p>The road is presently restricted to use by the Israeli army, Jewish settlers and Palestinian police and dignitaries.</p>
<p>Kostiner said he envisioned 140 new housing units on the site thus increasing Netzarim's current population from 200 Jews to 1000. He added the settlers had not yet received building permits.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the permits will be given. We have to work through the bureaucracy,&quot; Kostiner said.</p>
<p>Israel turned over most of the Gaza Strip to Palestinian self-rule in 1994 but retained control of Jewish settlements there. Some 3,000 Jews live amidst one million Palestinians in the impoverished territory.</p>
<p>The fate of the Jews in Gaza, Hebron and in other West Bank settlements will be decided in &quot;final-status&quot; talks between Israel and the Palestinians due to be completed by May 1999.</p>
