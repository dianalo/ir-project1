<title>BANGLADESH: Tough going at Bangladesh Hill Tracts peace talks.</title>
<headline>Tough going at Bangladesh Hill Tracts peace talks.</headline>
<dateline>DHAKA 1997-05-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>A third day of talks aimed at ending a decades-old separatist insurgency in Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts ended on Tuesday apparently without reaching any conclusions.</p>
<p>A security official told reporters outside the conference hall that the talks would resume on Wednesday. Officials could not say if any progress had been made.</p>
<p>More than 8,500 civilians, rebels and soldiers have been killed in a bush war started by tribal Shanti Bahini guerrillas in 1973.</p>
<p>Attempts to strike a peace deal since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina took office last June have yet to bear any fruit, officials said.</p>
<p>The Shanti Bahini want the 5,500 square miles (14,200 square km) of hill tracts in the southeast of the country to be officially designated as a tribal homeland with full autonomy, and some 500,000 Bengali-speaking settlers to be expelled from the region, which borders India and Burma.</p>
<p>The negotiations in Dhaka began hours behind schedule, with no official reason given for the delay.</p>
<p>A police officer told reporters around 8:30 p.m. (2030 local) that the negotiators had left the conference hall &quot;through the back doors.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Apparently they had nothing to report,&quot; a security official said.</p>
<p>The government side at the talks is being headed by Abdul Hasant Abdullah, parliamentary chief whip of the ruling Awami League.</p>
<p>Heading the rebel side is Jyotirindra Budhipriya Larma, chief of the Shanti Bahini's political wing, Parbatya Chattagram Janasanghati Samity (PCJSS).</p>
<p>The current meeting is the third with government leaders since January, but meeting sources said a breakthrough was still awaited.</p>
<p>The government has already started reclaiming tribal land and restoring it to thousands of tribal refugees who returned home in the first phase of a repatriation programme in March and April.</p>
<p>But the government has refused to expel the Bengalis, fearing a severe backlash, Hill Tracts officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The negotiations have hit rough ground on the issue of land rights of the tribes and their demand for a constitutional guarantee for special status of the tribal population,&quot; one meeting source said.</p>
<p>The settlers launched a strike in Hill Tracts on Sunday as the talks began in Dhaka against what they said was the government's willingness to give undue concessions to the tribals.</p>
<p>The government, however, said it would do nothing that encroached upon the rights of the settlers.</p>
