<p>The dollar ended a bit higher against the Japanese yen Tuesday despite selling pressure in Asian trading overnight, after rising to its highest level since early 1994 on Monday.</p>
<p>The dollar's outlook remained decidedly positive, with further gains expected down the road, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that the market was prone to some profit-taking given the kind of large run-up we've seen in the dollar over the last few days,&quot; said Marc Chandler, a senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in New York.</p>
<p>The dollar soared briefly to 111.68 yen in New York on Monday, its highest level since the start of 1994. Investors cashed in by selling dollars, which continued when trading started in Asia Tuesday.</p>
<p>In addition, remarks by a key Japanese financial official and comments from the head of the powerful Japan Federation of Economic Organisations put pressure on the dollar in Asian trading.</p>
<p>A Japanese news agency Tuesday quoted Eisuke Sakakibara, an official at Japan's Ministry of Finance, as telling American economists Japan would not raise interest rates until the end of its current fiscal year on March 31.</p>
<p>Yet Sakakibara, in Washington to attend the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, denied making the remarks.</p>
<p>&quot;The implication is that they might raise rates before the end of the fiscal year which would be negative for the dollar,&quot; said Chris Iggo, an international economist at Barclays Bank Plc.</p>
<p>Separately, Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the economic federation, told a news conference that an exchange rate of 100 to 110 yen to the dollar was broadly in line with Japanese economic fundamentals, and 111 was within acceptable bounds, though that level was a bit weak for the Japanese currency.</p>
<p>But the dollar managed to erase its overnight declines as traders again boosted the currency in New York.</p>
<p>In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 111.44 yen, up from 111.37 yen late on Monday. It rose to 1.5263 German marks from 1.5250 marks on Monday.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts were betting the dollar would move higher still.</p>
<p>&quot;The thing about the dollar's consolidation right here is that it's happening at higher levels,&quot; said Bob Lynch, a senior currency analyst at MMS International. &quot;I think that's probably encouraging people, making them think -- alright there's probably some room on the upside here.&quot;</p>
<p>News that the United States and Japan have agreed to try to settle a long-running dispute over the insurance market in Japan by year end gave the dollar a psychological lift. Acting United States trade representative Charlene Barshefsky made the announcement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's mildly supportive but I'd say that it's had very little direct impact on the exchange rate,&quot; Lynch said.</p>
<p>In other trade, the British pound was unchanged at $1.5650. The dollar edged up to 1.2555 Swiss francs from 1.2545 on Monday. It fell to Canadian $1.3597 from C$1.3620.</p>
