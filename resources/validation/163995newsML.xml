<headline>U.S. Crude Outlook - prices to search for bottom.</headline>

<p>U.S. crude prices are expected to search for a near-term bottom this week, continuing a recent, dramatic turn lower, traders and analysts said Monday.</p>
<p>Domestic grade differentials -- changing hands at lofty price levels in previous sessions -- were also pegged lower.</p>
<p>The status of heating oil remains a key feature in the crude market, as the question of how long the recent production burst can last reamins in focus.  </p>
<p>Outright crude prices are set &quot;for one final spike down,&quot; said Rita Beale, energy analyst at FIMAT, noting that refiners were taking care of the heating oil inventory gap, producing 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the latest measure.</p>
<p>Beale spied active technical support levels for the December NYMEX futures contract from $22.85-$22.65 a barrel, then again starting at $21.75 a barrel.</p>
<p>Cash dealers agreed with the call for price declines, saying once the bottom is established, the price differentials for crude grades will slide accordingly.  </p>
<p>&quot;Beyond all else, the fact is the sweet grades are overpriced,&quot; said a crude broker.</p>
<p>A Texas cash dealer said by Wednesday, the trend for weakening grades should be in place.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the bottom is in for West Texas Intermediate, they'll be giving up the grades,&quot; the Texas dealer said.</p>
<p>Early Monday, Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James has declined a few cents versus the WTI/Cushing benchmark, with traders talking at 68-72 cents over compared with 70-74 cents on Friday. Midland/WTI was down a cent to a 3-6 cents premium to WTI.  </p>
<p>Outside market factors could play into the mix, as the health of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and possible flare-ups in the Middle East are under scrutiny.</p>
<p>Yeltsin was expected to undergo heart surgery this week, opening the market to temporary jolts if the Russian leader does not survive.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, the surgery is not a factor unless he dies...and that would produce a very temporary spike upward,&quot; Beale said.  </p>
<p>Arbitrage levels for bringing foreign barrels over from West Africa and the North Sea remain uneconomical, preventing a drastic collapse in LLS, and other sweets.</p>
<p>On the sour grade side of the equation, prices have been easing in recent days on pressure from the surplus of Canadian heavy supplies into the U.S., and sales of U.S. government Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) inventories.</p>
<p>Traders said the decision by Sun Co Inc to keep shut the crude distillation unit at its Marcus Hook, Penn. refinery for an additional 26 days will aid products prices directly, and crude in a lesser fashion.  </p>
<p>She noted the fact fired Russian security chief -- and the most popular politician in Russia -- Alexander Lebed, accepted the presidential election system, muted fears of a civil disturbance if Yeltsin dies.</p>
<p>Traders said the two incidents of U.S. warplanes firing at Iraqi radar sites in the sourthern no-fly zone on Saturday and Monday, have failed to excite prospects for further face-offs.</p>
