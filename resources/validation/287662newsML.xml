<p>Justice Minister Giovanni Maria Flick won praise from magistrates on Sunday for his plan to overhaul Italy's creaking legal system but said a proposal to beef up plea-bargaining did not mean the end of the country's war on graft.</p>
<p>Flick's draft changes, which will be presented to the centre-left cabinet of Prime Minister Romano Prodi this week, were hailed by commentators as a way out of the notorious Tangentopoli (Bribesville) bribes-for-contracts scandals that broke in 1992 and toppled the political old guard.</p>
<p>The main novelty of the plan would be to allow defendants facing jail terms of up to three years to negotiate sentences provided they admitted guilt.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a short-cut for Tangentopoli,&quot; said Flick, a trained lawyer, adding his aim was &quot;a criminial justice system that works better for everyone&quot;.</p>
<p>The plan won the thumbs-up from magistrates and limited approval from several members of the opposition centre-right Freedom Alliance, who called it a good starting point for talks.</p>
<p>Milan's chief prosecutor Francesco Saverio Borelli, who has been at the heart of the Tangentopoli investigations, said the plan would &quot;unblock and speed up justice&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It's definitely not an amnesty in disguise,&quot; he said, adding he would extend it to crimes carrying longer penalties.</p>
<p>But Carlo Taormina, lawyer for ex-Socialist prime minister Bettino Craxi, a top Tangentopoli casualty sentenced to more than 25 years in jail, dismissed it as &quot;a licence to embezzle, extort, corrupt, launder dirty money, and traffic drugs with recourse to these immoral measures if you get caught&quot;.</p>
<p>Italy's lumbering legal system has been overwhelmed by the sheer size of Tangentopoli, a cosy web of corruption running right through politics and big business in which former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, and Cesare Romiti, the boss of Italy's biggest firm, car maker Fiat, are among those on trial.</p>
<p>Magistrates also want to try Prodi for alleged misconduct when he ran state holding IRI and even the former star anti-graft magistrate Antonio Di Pietro is under investigation.</p>
<p>Some 1,000 people have been sentenced since Tangentopoli broke but under Italian law a sentence becomes final only once the full appeals process has been exhausted. That takes years.</p>
<p>As probes have spiralled -- a fresh scandal over alleged trial and contract fixing dubbed &quot;Tangentopoli 2&quot; was uncovered last September -- legal and political figures have increasingly debated how to close the chapter on Tangentopoli.</p>
<p>Commentators say the new fast-track system with its &quot;super plea-bargain&quot; could be used in most criminal cases with the exception of murder, kidnapping, Mafia activities, major attacks and sexual violence which Flick has said would be exempt.</p>
<p>Plea-bargaining has only a limited use at present and the defendant does not have to admit guilt. Under the new system, graft charges would have the safety net that those convicted of corruption could still be barred from holding public office.</p>
<p>Flick also proposed allowing the payment of negotiable damages in return for up to a third off the sentence and the application of fast-track procedures to some crimes carrying life in jail, in which case the maximum term would be 30 years.</p>
