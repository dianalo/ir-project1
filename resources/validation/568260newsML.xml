<title>THAILAND: Battered Thai stocks continue to tumble.</title>

<p>Battered Thai stocks, already at a 5-1/2 year low, continued to tumble on Wednesday as economic worries spurred fresh selling, traders said.</p>
<p>By the lunch break the key Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index had lost 3.33 percent to 621.83 points. Across the board selling on Tuesday had already pulled the SET down to its lowest close since November 1, 1991.</p>
<p>Analysts said sentiment was undermined by a combination of lower economic growth prospects, concerns over the quality of loans and expectations of further poor first quarter earnings results.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are concerned about the loan portfolio quality. People are worried the non-performing loan figures banks and finance companies must declare at the end of the second quarter will be very bad,&quot; said Somchai Trairattanapirom, vice-president at Sitca Investment and Securities.</p>
<p>Uncertanties surrounding a number of mergers in the finance sector also contributed to weaker sentiment in the finance sector which lost 4.26 percent.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Thai Danu Bank said its planned merger with Finance One Plc was still on track despite rumours and media reports it was in danger of collapse.</p>
<p>Thai Danu's executive vice president Chaiwat Utaiwan told a news conference the boards of both companies were due to hold meetings on May 15 to approve the merger -- the biggest ever between Thai financial institutions.</p>
<p>Lower economic growth prospects and reduced expectations of a strong recovery also undermined sentiment on the bourse and fuelled sales of bank, energy and consumer stocks in the morning session, analysts said.</p>
