<p>The U.N. human rights office said on Thursday it was dismayed by allegations of massacres on Burundi's border of Hutu refugees fleeing Zaire and urgently appealed to Burundi's leaders to ensure their safety.</p>
<p>In a statement it said it had information indicating that Zairean ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels, who have taken large swathes of eastern Zaire, appeared to be coordinating actions with the Burundian army in screening Hutus returning to Burundi.</p>
<p>It said fighting between the Banyamulenge and Zairean troops &quot;reportedly involves the Rwandan Patriotic Front and elements of the Burundian armed forces&quot; -- both dominated by minority Tutsis -- and appealed to Rwanda to withdraw its troops from Zaire.</p>
<p>Zaire has accused Rwanda of invading. Rwanda denies the charge.</p>
<p>The statement was based on reports from three special U.N. human rights investigators for Africa's troubled Great Lakes region -- Paulo Sergio Pinheiro for Burundi, Rene Degni-Segui for Rwanda and Robert Garreto for Zaire.</p>
<p>In Burundi, it said only women and children were being allowed in at the border transit point of Gatumba while the fate of men remained uncertain.</p>
<p>Urging Burundi's government to allow human rights observers into the area, it said the three investigators were &quot;dismayed by allegations of massacres of returnees or refugees on the outskirts of Gatumba.&quot;</p>
<p>Nine bodies were recently found by human rights observers on the banks of nearby Ruzizi river, the statement added.</p>
<p>Refugees, aid workers, diplomats and human rights officials say the army has screened thousands of Hutu refugees forced home to Burundi from east Zaire since fighting erupted two weeks ago, and dozens of people taken away have not been seen since.</p>
<p>Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army has denied it killed the returnees.</p>
<p>Burundi's three-year-old civil war between the army and Hutu rebels has claimed at least 150,000 lives. In neighbouring Rwanda, more than half a million Tutsis and Hutu moderates died in a Hutu-led genocide in 1994.</p>
