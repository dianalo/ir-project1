<p>Japhet N'Doram, who helped Nantes lift the 1995 French championship, was one of seven different scorers as his side won for the first time this season with a specatular 7-0 rout of Nice on Saturday.</p>
<p>Nantes had won by the same score only once before in 1970 against Nancy and Saturday's result was the first time in the French first division that all the goals in a 7-0 victory were netted by different players.</p>
<p>Nantes coach Jean-Claude Suaudeau said: &quot;We scored very early (Jocelyn Gourvennec and N'Doram inside the opening 15 minutes) and my players needed that little soupcon of success to explode.&quot;</p>
<p>Paris Saint-Germain, who last won the title the year before Nantes, beat Le Havre 2-0 at home to open a six-point lead with goals by Brazilian Leonardo and midfielder Benoit Cauet.</p>
<p>The only unbeaten team in the top flight, European Cup Winners' Cup holders PSG ended a run of two draws that had slowed their progress towards their main goal, the league title.</p>
<p>Monaco, inspired by two-goal Brazilian striker Anderson, bounced back from a midweek defeat at champions Auxerre to beat Rennes 3-1 at home and leap six places to second.</p>
<p>Bastia, previous incumbents of second place, crashed 3-1 at Montpellier to drop behind Monaco on goal difference.</p>
<p>Auxerre, equal fourth with Bordeaux, came from behind to draw 1-1 at Cannes with a goal by their defender Alain Goma, called up to the French national team this week.</p>
<p>Another uncapped defender called up on Thursday, Vincent Candela, scored the only goal as Guingamp beat Lyon 1-0 at home.</p>
<p>Metz striker Robert Pires, another member of Aime Jacquet's squad for next week's friendly at home to Turkey, was sent off near the end of his side's 2-2 draw at Lens for violent play.</p>
<p>Lens fought back after the visitors, who are in sixth place, had gone two goals up inside six minutes.</p>
<p>At Nantes, N'Doram scored his fifth goal of the season as Nantes, in one stroke, improved their goal difference to 17-17.</p>
<p>Nantes' confidence has grown with the introduction of junior international goalkeeper Mickael Landreau, not yet 18, who has kept clean sheets in his first two first division matches.</p>
<p>The win did not, however, lift Nantes out of the relegation zone they have languished in all season, taking only five points from five draws in their previous 10 matches.</p>
<p>Lille robbed bottom club Nancy of their first win of the season with an 88th minute equaliser by Denis Abed in a 2-2 draw at home. Lille, who opened their account through Yugoslav Miladin Becanovic, had not previously scored away this season.</p>
<p>Striker Stephane Guivarc'h's consolation goal for Rennes at Monaco put him at the top of the scorers' list with Bastia's Anton Drobnjak, who missed his side's defeat because he was away on World Cup duty with Yugoslavia.</p>
