<p>Germany's budget deficit will reach 3.3 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, above the three percent ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty but not necessarily too high to prevent it from qualifying for monetary union, the Ifo economic research institute said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The estimate, published in Ifo's half-yearly economic report, is higher than the 3.2 percent forecast it made at its annual meeting in June. For 1998, Ifo expects the deficit to fall to 2.6 percent of GDP, well below the ceiling.</p>
<p>But Ifo, one of Germany's six leading research institutes, said its 1997 forecast was subject to considerable uncertainties and that the figure could well be &quot;one or the other decimal point closer to the 3 percent reference level.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But even if the forecast turns out to be right, Germany should not be denied entry to the monetary union because the Maastricht Treaty also takes account of the sustainability of state consolidation,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;A 'point landing' to 3.0 percent, which the Maastricht Treaty does not demand as an absolute necessity, is difficult from today's point of view,&quot; Ifo added.</p>
<p>The German budget was under pressure because of rising unemployment which was leading to tax revenue shortfalls while boosting government spending. In 1996, Germany's budget deficit was 3.8 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>The institute also said it was sceptical whether delaying the start of European economic and monetary union (EMU), scheduled for January, 1999, would help to remove doubts about the stability of the planned single currency.</p>
<p>If a postponement led European countries to relax their efforts to consolidate their budgets or to boost spending on job creation programmes, financial markets would probably interpret this as the end of the euro project for the time being, Ifo said.</p>
<p>&quot;This would probably result in strong turbulence on the currency markets. The D-mark should then appreciate significantly against important European currencies, with negative consequences for exports and employment,&quot; Ifo said.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank would have the option to respond by cutting interest rates, but on balance this would not be able to prevent a negative impact on the domestic economy.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact from an inflation point of view the conditions for an early start to EMU are quite good, because price stability in Europe was never as strong as it is now. It is by no means sure this would be the case if the starting date was put back.&quot;</p>
<p>The Ifo report comes amid a heated debate in Germany about how strictly the Maastricht convergence criteria should be applied.</p>
<p>Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber has put himself at the forefront of a campaign for a stable Euro by arguing that countries must not be allowed any overshoot beyond 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>But senior Bundesbank officials have said the Treaty allows leeway for a slight overshoot as long as a country demonstrates it can maintain lasting fiscal discipline.</p>
<p>Ifo said the institutes had repeatedly stressed that the debate about decimal points made little sense.</p>
<p>&quot;The key factor with budget consolidation is that it be sustainable,&quot; Ifo said.</p>
<p>&quot;That is why the Maastricht Treaty does not only take account of adherence to the three percent goal in the 1997 reference year but also takes account of the sustainability of the deficit reduction when judging whether a nation qualifies.&quot;</p>
<p>One-off measures  or &quot;accounting tricks&quot; aimed at fulfilling the criteria in 1997 did not fulfil the requirements, Ifo said.</p>
<p>The institute added that Germany still had scope to cut government subsidy outlays because some of the companies receiving subsidy payments were benefiting from the current weakness of the mark.</p>
<p>Ifo also predicted that the public debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to about 62 percent in 1997 and remain at that level in 1998. In 1997, the debt to GDP ratio was just over 60 percent.</p>
<p>Taking into account privatisation proceeds, the ratio will fall be half a percentage point lower than the 62 percent forecast in 1997, Ifo said.</p>
<p>The 1998 forecast is one percentage point lower than 62 percent if privatisation income and proceeds from the planned revaluation of Bundesbank currency reserves are included, Ifo said.</p>
