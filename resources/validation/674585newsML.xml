<title>CHINA: Shanghai T-bill repo rates, spots end down.</title>
<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates, spots end down.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-06-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mostly down on Thursday mainly due to a lack of new domestic A share issues on the Shanghai stock exchange, traders said.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most actively traded seven-day contract closed unchanged at 12.00 percent.</p>
<p>Total turnover of the six-contract market fell to 3.1 million lots from 1.6 million lots.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.  </p>
<p>&quot;The lack of new A share issues on the Shanghai bourse after the past few days of heavy issues was the major factor depressing fund demand and repo rates today,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>But traders said with state banks shifting their state debt trading to the local Chinese yuan interbank market, fund supply on the exchange-based repo market would fall in the mid-term, which would support the repo rates.</p>
<p>&quot;State banks used to be net lenders on the bourse-based repo market with their trading volume accounting for 80 percent of total lending,&quot; said a second trader. &quot;Their withdrawal will cut money supply and push up the rates in the mid-term.&quot;  </p>
<p>Traders said they expected the repo rates to move around the current level on Friday.</p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly down on Thursday mainly because of some institutional liquidation, traders said.</p>
<p>The most actively traded 10-year bond that matures in June 2006 fell to 108.58 yuan from 109.27 yuan.</p>
<p>Combined volume of the eight-contract market fell to 3.1 million lots from 668,950 lots.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected the contracts to rise in the next few days. -- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-7004</p>
