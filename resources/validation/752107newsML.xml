<p>South African drinks and sweets firm Cadbury Schweppes SA Ltd is set to post healthy half year growth, buoyed by good local demand and a windfall from a stake in Amalgamated Beverage Industries Ltd (ABI) , analysts said.</p>
<p>South Africans' taste for the firm's range of soft drinks and chocolate bars has not diminished despite a slow down in the broader economy.</p>
<p>&quot;It has reasonable growth in this environment...volume growth has been good and it is a well-managed company,&quot; said one analyst who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>Analysts said the firm had impressed investors with a strong and successful marketing strategy and also benefitted from its top drawer brand names.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a well managed company. They are doing well and they have very good products and brands,&quot; said another analyst.</p>
<p>Analysts are expecting interim earnings per share on a range of 17.2 cents to 17.6 and a dividend of 3.4 cents 3.5. The consensus figures were for earnings of 17.4 cents and a dividend of 3.44. </p>
<p>The figures compare to 146.6 and 29.0 cents respectively last time, but late last month the firm had a ten for one share split which dilutes profits per share by ten times.</p>
<p>Factoring in the share split leaves real earnings per share growth on a range of 17.3 to 20.1 percent.</p>
<p>The firm's shares, which started 1997 at 730 cents, have been climbing steadily all year and are now trading at 9.90 rand -- in real terms a firm gain on its pre-share split year high of 96.50 rand.</p>
<p>However, one analyst said he was concerned about the firm's gearing due a number of capital expenditure projects coming through into the balance sheet.</p>
<p>At it year results in March Cadswep said it expected real earnings growth in the current financial year. &quot;Satisfactory real growth in earnings is expected to be achieved,&quot; the firm said then.</p>
<p>Cadswep owns a slice of bottler ABI and its earnings will get a lift from ABI's strong growth, which saw it in May lift year pre-tax profit to 201.4 million rand from 160.7 million last time.</p>
<p>Both Cadswep and ABI also stand to gain from the travails suffered by Pepsi's failed New Age Beverages (NAB) venture that is currently under provisional liquidation.</p>
<p>NAB's collapse should provide both firms with an opportunity to snap up extra market share, analysts said.</p>
