<p>Portugal has agreed to set up an independnent commission to investigate its financial dealings with Nazi Germany, especially on the question of looted gold, the World Jewish Congress said on Monday.</p>
<p>The WJC said that in a meeting last Friday with Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres in Washington, Portugal agreed to set up a three-member commission with one of its members being named by the Jewish group. The Portuguese Central Bank was already conducting an investigation.</p>
<p>Guterres agreed that all government and central bank archives will be opened so that researchers can trace dealings between Portugal and Nazi Germany during the Second World War.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence documents found in the National Archives said Portugal received $139 million in looted gold during the war that would be worth $1.5 billion at today's prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister stressed that there would be no problem in having the central bank open its records. Portugal is to be commended. The meeting with the prime minister was warm, constructive and historic,&quot; said Elan Steinberg, the executive director of the WJC.</p>
<p>Documents uncovered in British archives two weeks ago said that four tons of looted Dutch gold was found at the Portuguese Central Bank in its original wrappers at the end of the war.</p>
<p>Archive documents suggested that Portugal was the second biggest recipient of looted gold after Switzerland during the war. Switzerland was alleged to have received $415 million from the Germans. Both countries were neutral during the war and both traded with the Allies and the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Portugal began the war with 63,000 tons of gold and ended it with 356,000 tons, a six-fold increase. But much of the increase in gold came from trading with the United States.</p>
