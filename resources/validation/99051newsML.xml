<title>USA: US Southeast spot power prices firm despite storm.</title>
<headline>US Southeast spot power prices firm despite storm.</headline>

<p>Bulk electricity prices in the southeastern U.S. on Monday remained firm against Friday's levels despite forecasts of Tropical Storm Josephine bringing rain and clouds into the region, market sources said.</p>
<p>Most participants explained the cooling effect from Josephine set a bearish tone for the power market, opposed to a bullish underpinning for the natural gas market because strong winds and choppy water led many pipeline operators to shut-in offshore natgas production in the U.S. Gulf.</p>
<p>Tight transmission constraints in the Southeast had a more supporting effect on spot power prices, they said.</p>
<p>Limited capacity on high-voltage transmission lines offset low demand on the systems of the utilities in the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC), traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Their minimum loads are fairly low,&quot; noted one Southeast trader.</p>
<p>Peak, firm power during heavy load hours for delivery into the northern part of the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA) system was quoted at $15.00-$16.00, up from Friday's $14.50 for Monday.</p>
<p>At the Georgia-Florida border, firm, peak electricity was valued near $22.75 a MWh, compared with Friday's quote of $22.00-$22.75 for Monday power.</p>
<p>TVA was reportedly offering peak, non-firm electricity for Tuesday at $18.00-$18.50 a MWh, up from Friday's $17.50 quote for Monday delivery.</p>
