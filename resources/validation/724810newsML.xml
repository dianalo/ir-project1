<p>A vast hole in the ground, busy with workmen in hard hats, marks the spot where the Great Library of Alexandria is rising from the dead on the southern shores of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>More than seven years after royalty and presidents gathered in Egypt to pledge money to the project, the $230 million library is rapidly taking shape, close to where Euclid and Eratosthenes taught geometry in Greek more than 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;We have 400 workers from all over the world, working 24 hours a day in two shifts... We should be finished by the end of 1998,&quot; said civil engineer Yousri El Hakim, the head of the construction monitoring unit.</p>
<p>The project, brainchild of Alexandrian historian Mustafa al-Abbadi in the 1970s, has certainly had its ups and downs. Given the problems raising money to build, stock and run the library, many doubted it would ever see the light of day.</p>
<p>But the Egyptian government, riding on a modest economic boom, has now underwritten the budget and the architects at least say the government is paying them in full and on time.</p>
<p>350,000 BOOKS ACQUIRED</p>
<p>Egyptian state company Arab Contractors, with Italian partners Rodio and Trevi, finished off the substructure last December at a cost of about $60 million -- most of the money donated by Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>The current second phase, constructing the circular 10-storey main building at a cost of about $120 million, began straight away under a separate contract with Arab Contractors and the British company Balfour Beatty.</p>
<p>&quot;At first the project was supported by UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) but UNESCO had many problems and now it is 100 percent Egyptian, under the Ministry of Higher Education,&quot; said Hakim.</p>
<p>Mohsen Zahran, project manager for the grandly named Bibliotheca Alexandrina, told reporters the government had also given the library a budget for acquisitions and so far he had gathered 350,000 books to stock the shelves.</p>
<p>A major acquisition during June was a complete microfilm record of the priceless Arabic manuscripts in the Escorial library in Spain, donated by the Spanish royal family, he added.</p>
<p>The library, with 69,000 square metres (750,000 square feet) of floor space, has room for up to eight million volumes, plus hundreds of thousands of manuscripts, tapes, CDs and videos.</p>
<p>SITE IN ROYAL QUARTER</p>
<p>The stock will cost about $31 million and equipment another $20 million, the project managers said.</p>
<p>The idea is not just a library but a centre for learning and research with the emphasis on the civilisations of ancient Egypt, Greece and the rest of the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The original library, built under the Greek Ptolemies who ruled Egypt for the last 300 years of the first millennium BC, also doubled as a university. As the best-stocked library of the age, it attracted scholars from all over the region.</p>
<p>The fate of the old library is shrouded in mystery. Some say it burned down when Julius Caesar's legions sacked the city in 48 BC, others add that parts of it survived until the Arab invasion of Egypt more than 600 years later.</p>
<p>No one now knows exactly where it stood, either. But recent archaeological work suggests that the site of the new library, right on the seafront at the eastern end of the eastern harbour, lies smack in the old royal quarter, probably within a few hundred metres (yards) of the original.</p>
<p>A SLICE THROUGH TIME</p>
<p>&quot;Before the work began, we excavated the site and found some mosaics from the Hellenistic and Roman periods, so we think we are in the right area,&quot; said archaeologist Ibrahim Darwish.</p>
<p>When completed, the library should be a striking addition to the appearance of modern Alexandria, a city which retains much of the splendour of its early 20th century heyday despite some damage from thoughtless development over the last 30 years.</p>
<p>The 10-story building, circular to suggest the disc of the sun, tilts about 20 degrees towards the sea to the north, with the front part sunk below ground level.</p>
<p>To the south, a windowless back wall of red granite from southern Egypt -- a favourite Pharaonic building stone -- will carry representative inscriptions in the varied scripts of the region, the birthplace of alphabetic writing. Daylight will enter instead from windows in the sloping roof.</p>
<p>&quot;The structure represents a slice through time. The deeper you go, the older the era gets. Then there is the disc of the sun rising up towards the future,&quot; said Zahran.</p>
