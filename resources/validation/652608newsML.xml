<p>South Africa's drugs industry on Wednesday cautiously welcomed moves by Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma to redraft a series of controversial health bills.</p>
<p>Zuma said in a statement to parliament that she had taken note of criticism during two days of public hearings and would resubmit the bills to cabinet next week.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome the fact and we certainly hope that she takes note of the issues and areas of concern that we raised,&quot; Erica Mann, vice-president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Two proposals from Zuma have particularly enraged the pharmaceuticals industry.</p>
<p>The first aims to promote cheap generic substitutes over brand name drugs by instructing pharmacists to dispense them unless expressly forbidden to do so. The industry says that amounts to mandatory substitution.</p>
<p>The second measure would also curb brands by barring sales to the State of medicines containing the brand-name in the label.</p>
<p>But Mann said there was still concern that any redrafted bills should still go through another process of consultation with the public and industry figures.</p>
<p>&quot;We are worried that they would be subimtted straight to cabinet. They should be put up for another review and consultation,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Zuma has already backed down once on the health reforms when a legal challenge last year by SmithKline Beecham Plc saw the plans being withdrawn for a process of consultation.</p>
<p>The drugs industry says the resulting new proposals differed little from the originals. Mann said it was possible this could happen again.</p>
<p>&quot;There might only be cosmetic changes,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The planned legislation has also angered foreign firms and the United States government. Pharmaceutical multinationals have said they may not invest in South Africa and the U.S. has said it may take the dispute over brand names to the World Trade Organisation.</p>
