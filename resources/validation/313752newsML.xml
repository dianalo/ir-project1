<headline>Taiwan stocks end at highest level in six years.</headline>

<p>Taiwan share prices closed higher on Thursday, pushing to a six-year high after punching through strong resistance at 7,200 points, brokers said.</p>
<p>The weighted Taiwan index gained 40.96 points or 0.57 percent to close at 7,206.42.</p>
<p>That surpassed the 7,189.47 point close of January 13, which until Thursday had stood as the highest close since 7,339.71 on June 5, 1990. The index hit its historic high of 12,495.34 on February 10, 1990.</p>
<p>Turnover was an active T$75.4 billion, down somewhat from recent T$100 billion-plus days as investors turned cautious.  </p>
<p>Brokers attributed the rise to strategic, speculative buying by major investors on financial shares, the index's most heavily weighted sector, and asset-backed stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;It's obvious that major market players tried to buy these heavily weighted shares to boost the overall upward momentum,&quot; said Jardine Fleming Securities manager George Hou.</p>
<p>&quot;But such a liqudity-driven rise has turned speculative, making investors cautious about increasing shareholdings.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the index gain, total sell orders actually exceeded buy orders, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Asset-backed shares rose most, with Evergreen Transport and Sinkong Spinning up the daily seven percent limit to T$75.5 and T$60.5, respectively.</p>
<p>Financials also were strong, with International Bills up T$1.3 to T$27.7 and China Bills up 60 cents to T$26.9.</p>
<p>Shares in the Formosa Plastics group attracted buying, with Formosa Chemical Fiber up 70 cents to T$43.9 and Nan Ya Plastics up 50 cents to T$66.5. Electronics fell slightly, with CMC Magnetics down T$1.5 to T$52.5.</p>
<p>Brokers said they did not expect any major gains ahead as recent gains had turned speculative.</p>
