<p>Private capital flows to the emerging economies hit record levels in 1996 but were expected to plateau this year despite continued increases in equity investment, the Institute of International Finance said Thursday.</p>
<p>The global association of private financial institutions said that investment rose 19 percent last year to $231.5 billion and is expected to remain near that level at $231.2 billion this year.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is a growing investor interest in emerging markets today, reflecting improved economic fundamentals and a trend towards global portfolio diversification among both institutional and retail investors,&quot; IIF Managing Director Charles Dallara told a briefing for reporters.</p>
<p>But overall borrowing from banks and bond markets is expected to slow this year as some borrowing countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Russia and Thailand show more restraint.  </p>
<p>This &quot;would reflect strength rather than weakness because of more normalized econonic conditions (in these countries)&quot; said IIF chief economist William Cline during the briefing.</p>
<p>Dallara cautioned against thinking that the funds flowing into these areas were almost all &quot;hot money&quot; that would exit quickly when speculators perceived more action elsewhere.</p>
<p>&quot;It's often viewed that a lot of money going into emerging markets is hot money -- and certainly there is an element of that -- but if one looks at the numbers for equity investment (they) have steadily risen in recent years.&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The IIF estimated that equity investment, which rose from $98.7 billion to $103.6 billion in 1996, would grow to $116 billion this year.</p>
<p>It said a large part of this represented long-term investments that are hard to back out of by multilateral corporations, joint venture partners and private investors.</p>
<p>The Institute study covered China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Phillippines, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic, Turkey, Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, South Africa and Tunisia.  </p>
<p>The new investment represented an effort by investors to diversify globally but the trend had been helped by tepid growth and low interest rates in the Group of Seven Industrial countries, the Institute said.</p>
<p>Dallara cited &quot;the relatively modest economic outlook for performance of G7 countries which has led to a exceptionally low interest rate profile in the U.S., Europe and in Japan that has led investors to look for yield and look for return elsewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>But the IIF chief also waved a red flag, saying that the huge investment flows to emerging markets had reduced their return in some cases to a point that raised the question of whether the return was sufficient for the risk involved.  </p>
<p>&quot;The strength of flows and narrowing of spreads during 1996 suggests that investors will need to carefuly monitor risks,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;It is not clear that risks are being fully priced in all instances.&quot;</p>
<p>Specifically, he cited Turkey, where a reduction in the interest rate spreads from 1995 to 1996 have not been matched by an improvement in economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, I think it is fair to say there are some significant challenges which Turkish authorities face today,&quot; Dallara said.</p>
<p>The low spreads for the Central European economies were largely justified, but they have &quot;moved to a point where one does need to carefully assess the relationship between risk and fundamentals.&quot;</p>
