<p>French carmaker Renault said on Tuesday it had decided to commission an independent study to explore alternatives to the proposed closure of its Vilvoorde assembly plant in Belgium.</p>
<p>The move appeared to be a response to pressure from France's new Socialist-led government, which is the biggest shareholder in the loss-making privatised firm.</p>
<p>Renault said in a statement at the start of an annual shareholders' meeting that chairman Louis Schweitzer wanted another board meeting before the end of June to assess the results of the study.</p>
<p>Belgian workers managed to enter and disrupt the meeting, chanting &quot;Schweitzer go&quot; and &quot;Vilvoorde, Vilvoorde&quot;.</p>
<p>The latest episode in the Belgian closure saga is seen as a key test of the new French government's industrial policy.</p>
<p>Renault's share price closed down 4.63 percent at 127.8 francs before the company's announcement of a review.</p>
<p>The plant closure, scheduled for July 31, provoked a storm of union and political protest in Belgium and France when it was announced abruptly in February. The factory, which still employs around 2,900 after some staff left, is in the hometown of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene.</p>
<p>New French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin criticised the closure plan during his election campaign and Dehaene met him in Paris last Saturday to appeal for a review.</p>
<p>Junior industry minister Christian Pierret said in a first reaction that the government was happy there would be an objective study of the Renault decision and was not sure that the closure was indispensable.</p>
<p>The company statement said: &quot;This independent study will allow an economic evaluation of possible measures, within the framework of existing law, to compensate for the cost excesses related to Renault's production stucture.</p>
<p>&quot;In the event that the study leads the company to confirm its initial decision, a plan would be immediately implemented, including on the one hand the appropriate social measures and, on the other hand, the establishment of a significant industrial activity on the site.&quot;</p>
<p>The Renault board renewed its confidence in Schweitzer, who proposed a meeting before the end of the month to analyse the conclusions of a study which would be conducted by Danielle Kaisergruber of Bernard Bruhnes consultancy, the statement said.</p>
<p>It said Tuesday's move was needed because of the importance of the proposed plant closure on Renault's economic performance and the social consequences.</p>
<p>Renault, which lost 5.25 billion francs ($909.3 million) last year, has insisted the plant must close to streamline its money-losing car assembly operations and cut costs.</p>
<p>It has already said shorter work weeks are not a solution to Renault's need to bring its scattered production operations in line with those of its competitors in Europe.</p>
<p>Renault says its annual production per site averages 125,000 cars compared with more than 200,000 at Ford, GM Opel and Volkswagen.</p>
<p>Car industry analysts say they believe the new government would concede, after examining the situation, that tough measures were essential to save Renault.</p>
<p>&quot;It's highly unclear who is running this company,&quot; said a London-based analyst referring to the government, which represents the state's 46 percent stake. &quot;Renault have been passing themselves off as independent... As an investor, I'd feel safer on the sidelines.&quot;</p>
<p>Renault-Vilvoorde workers, who staged a long occupation of the plant after the closure was announced, began another three-day strike on Monday.</p>
