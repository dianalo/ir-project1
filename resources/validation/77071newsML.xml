<title>CHINA: China stock market focus shifts back to Shanghai.</title>
<headline>China stock market focus shifts back to Shanghai.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1996-09-25</dateline>

<p>The focus of China's stock markets has shifted back to the Shanghai stock exchange with liquidity returning from the Shenzhen bourse and the trend will continue in the next few weeks, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>An announcement by the Shanghai exchange on Tuesday that it will lower trading fees and shift to more off-floor trading helped boost market sentiment, with share prices in Shenzhen becoming too expensive after months of surges, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Liquidity has flown into Shanghai since last Friday when rumours said that the exchange would announce market-boosting measures,&quot; said one stock analyst with Guangdong Finance Securities. &quot;Much of the funds is institutional hot money (speculative funds) flowing out of the Shenzhen market.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With share prices having surged for months in Shenzhen, the room for further rises became limited. This made funds flow to Shanghai,&quot; said one broker with China Securities. &quot;The new measures announced by the Shanghai exchange helped accelerate the process.&quot;</p>
<p>Turnover on Shanghai's domestic A share market hit a 1996 high of 8.2 billion yuan ($987.9 million) on Monday against Shenzhen's 3.41 billion, after lagging behind for months. It was 7.2 billion yuan against 4.18 billion yuan on Tuesday.</p>
<p>There has been a bull run on the A markets since Beijing in mid-April called for development of the stock market.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen A index has surged more than 140 percent, while its Shanghai counterpart lagged and rose only about 50 percent mainly because Shenzhen took the initiative and implemented market-boosting measures.</p>
<p>&quot;Shanghai has taken back the initiative for the time being and this situation is expected to last for a few weeks at least,&quot; said an analyst with J &amp; A Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;But, in the medium term, which market will be the focus by late this year will depend on how much the cities do to improve their trading environment,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;This is because the current bull run was triggered by official policy support and whether it continues depends very much on that support,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Shanghai exchange was under pressure from brokers to make itself more competitive after its position as China's prime stock market came under attack in recent months from Shenzhen.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Shanghai exchange said that, as from October 3, commissions on share and fund trading will be cut to 0.35 percent from 0.4 percent while handling charges will be reduced to 0.012 percent from 0.015 percent.</p>
<p>Shenzhen cut its fees in a similar way earlier this year, part of the active support it has received from the city government.</p>
<p>The Shanghai exchange also announced that it would expand off-floor trading to allow securities houses and investors to trade via remote computer connections, which would apply to all securities firms, both domestic and foreign.</p>
