<p>OrthoLogic Corp chairman and chief officer Allen Weinstein said Tuesday the company's third-quarter earnings per share would be $0.07 to $0.09, and that the company is comfortable with $0.28 earnings per share for the year.</p>
<p>&quot;For the third quarter, we'll be in that range of $0.07 to $0.09. We're pretty comfortable with that ($0.28 per share) for the year,&quot; Weinstein told Reuters following a presentation at a Dain Bosworth healthcare conference.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've made our investment in the direct sales organization in June and July and now the question is whether or not that investment pays off to make the bottom line,&quot; Weinstein said.</p>
<p>He also said the company expected productivity increases as a result of its recent acquisition of Sutter Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;With Sutter, we're doing $400,000 to $425,000 in sales per sales rep. With the leveraged capability of the sales force referral system with Sutter, we would like to see sales go up to about $600,000 per person.</p>
<p>Sutter is a San Diego, Calif.-based manufacturer of continuous passive motion devices.</p>
<p>Weinstein held out the possibility of yet another acquisition this year. &quot;We're definitely looking at additional acquisitions,&quot; he said.</p>
