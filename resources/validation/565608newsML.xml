<p>Bakery and foodstuffs firm George Weston Ltd will post higher operating earnings this year than in 1996, President Richard Currie told reporters on Wednesday after the annual meeting.</p>
<p>Last year, Weston earned C$5.02 a share or C$239 million, including a C$1.16 a share or C$87 million gain from the C$225 million sale of the Neilson confectionary businesss.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll make the same without the capital gain as we made with it,&quot; Currie said. &quot;That's a material increase in earnings.&quot;  </p>
<p>Currie said Weston would see a double-digit sales increase at wholly owned food retailer, which had 1996 sales of C$2.4 billion. He added that Loblaw's 1997 earnings per share would be in line with analysts' forecasts of C$0.83 to C$0.89.</p>
<p>Loblaw accounts for 77 percent of Weston's sales.</p>
<p>Currie said subsidiary Weston Foods would turn a profit, but added that paper and forest products unit E.B. Eddy &quot;will be hard pressed to make a gain, but they'll have a reasonable year, certainly a lot better than most people are having in the pulp and paper industry right now.&quot;  </p>
<p>Forestry firms have been hurt by dropping paper prices.</p>
<p>Currie did not rule out selling non-core assets such as Eddy. &quot;I don't know the answer to that until we get all these businesses operating the way we want them to operate,&quot; Currie said. On the other hand, &quot;we could make it bigger,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Only Loblaw was considered a core business, Currie said.</p>
<p>Asked at the meeting about a stock split, Currie said: &quot;At $100 we'll talk about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Weston shares rose 0.25 to 79 on the Toronto Stock Exchange today in light trading.</p>
