<p>At least 16 people were killed and 57 injured when a passenger train hit a bus at an open railway crossing in central India on Sunday, officials said.</p>
<p>The accident occurred near Guna, some 160 km (100 miles) northwest of the Madhya Pradesh state capital Bhopal.</p>
<p>&quot;Sixteen people have died and another 57 have been injured in the accident,&quot; K.D.P. Rao, a senior district official, told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>Rao said the train smashed into the bus and carried it along for nearly 100 metres. All the dead were travelling on the bus.</p>
<p>&quot;There were no passengers on the train as it was only a locomotive with a couple of wagons,&quot; Rao said.</p>
<p>He said the condition of 16 of the injured was serious and they had been shifted to hospitals in Bhopal and Gwalior.</p>
<p>&quot;Eight people have been moved to Bhopal and another eight have been shifted to Gwalior,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>An enquiry has been ordered into the accident, Rao said.</p>
