<p>Britain's Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) said on Wednesday it was obvious documents which had been returned to it through the courts by Andrew Regan and others involved in a takeover attempt of the mutually-owned group were CWS property.</p>
<p>The supermarkets-to-funeral parlours group faces a 1.2 billion pound ($2 billion) takeover attempt by Galileo Group, a special bidding vehicle set up by Regan, with the backing of several City institutions. The bid was held up last week when CWS took legal action demanding the return of confidential papers.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday Galileo said it had complied with a court order demanding it, Regan, his Lanica investment trust, Lanica director and former CWS advisor David Lyons and suspended CWS manager Allan Green provided sworn affidavits detailing what information had been disclosed.</p>
<p>In a statement Galileo said the information had been made available voluntarily to it by a CWS employee. CWS said the documents concerned comprised seven large boxes of internal minutes and board papers and were clearly CWS property.</p>
<p>&quot;The affidavits filed at court by Andrew Regan and his fellow conspirators tell an extraordinary story.&quot; It said Green was passing on documents over many months &quot;and it appears that he was encouraged to do that by Mr. Regan and David Lyons&quot; CWS said in a statement.</p>
<p>CWS said it had written to Regan, Lyons, merchant bank Hambros and law firm Travers Smith Braithwaite to ask which of the documents were shown to Regan's advisors and whether any of them had asked where they came from and how they were obtained. ($ = 0.612 British Pounds)</p>
