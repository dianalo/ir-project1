<p>Shares in the Prague heating utility, Prazska Teplarenska a.s. are illiquid and overpriced at their current level, market analysts said.</p>
<p>They said that despite a long winter which helped boost first half earnings, the firm's current ownership structure with two groups vying for control creates problems in acurately assessing its share price.</p>
<p>Bahamas-based investor Michael Dingman's Cyprus-based Daventree funds, in concert with Czech expatriate Viktor Kozeny's Harvard funds hold 43 percent of the company, while the city of Prague holds 26 percent and its German ally firm  GESO a 21 percent stake.</p>
<p>&quot;Teplarenska's share price can be influenced by the battle for control between its major shareholders -- Harvard (and through it Daventree) on the one hand and the city of Prague and Geso on the other,&quot; said Miroslav Nosal of Patria Finance.</p>
<p>Teplarenska shares rose by over 60 percent in the last three months, due mainly to the battle.</p>
<p>But Teplarenska shares, which are traded on the main market of the Prague Stock Exchange, lost 18 crowns at Friday's price fixing to close at 1,417, just below its year-high of 1,441 set at the end of July.</p>
<p>Brokers, however, said they would recommend the stock as a buy only up to around 1,000 crowns.</p>
<p>Teplarenska, a heat supplier to about 240,000 residential and thousands of commerical customers in the capital region, posted a 793 million gross profit in the first half of this year, sharply up from 469 million in the same period of 1995.</p>
<p>But analysts warned that the sharp increase of profits which occured in the first half would not repeat.</p>
<p>&quot;This (increase in profits) was probably caused by the long winter and by opening the new heat link from (the town of) Melnik, which allowed to get new customers,&quot; said Ivo Pestuka from brokerage house Atlantik FT.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unrealistic to expect the same positive results in the second half,&quot; added Nosal.</p>
<p>Marcela Gronychova of OFT Brokers said that the firm's announced 15 percent price cut for some households would also bite into revenues. &quot;We estimate 1996 revenues to reach 4.3 billion crowns (after 4.1 billion last year),&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Analysts predictions vary for the firm's full-year performance. AKRO Capital's Tomas Navratil expects net profit of 260-290 million crowns, while Pestuka sees it between 380- 400 million.</p>
<p>The company posted a 281 million net profit last year.</p>
