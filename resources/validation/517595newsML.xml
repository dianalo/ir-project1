<p>A 1962 internal company document in which an R.J. Reynolds researcher said there was overwhelming evidence of the health hazards of cigarette smoking was introduced on Thursday at the trial of a wrongful death lawsuit against the company.</p>
<p>Judge Bernard Nachman overruled an objection by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co and allowed attorneys for plaintiff Dana Raulerson to enter the memo as evidence.</p>
<p>Raulerson sued Reynolds on behalf of her sister, Jean Connor, who smoked heavily and died at age 49 from lung cancer.  </p>
<p>In the document, Reynolds senior researcher Alan Rodgman wrote: &quot;Obviously, the amount of evidence accumulated to indict cigarette smoke as a health hazard is overwhelming. The evidence challenging such an indictment is scant.&quot;</p>
<p>The memo was introduced during the testimony of Dr. Victor Roggli, a Duke University forensic pathologist who told jurors earlier that Connor died from lung cancer caused by smoking.</p>
<p>Raulerson's lawyers introduced the Rodgman memo to bolster one of the essential claims of the lawsuit, that R.J. Reynolds executives knew the hazards of cigarette smoking and failed to act to correct a defective product.  </p>
<p>Reynolds' lawyers objected to introduction of the memo on the grounds that they had not been told that Roggli would be asked to comment on it. Nachman overruled the objection.</p>
<p>Asked if Rodgman had enough sound evidence at the time to draw the conclusions he did, Roggli answered yes.</p>
<p>Raulerson's lawyers have said that Reynolds was legally responsible for warning consumers and fixing a defective product if they knew that it was dangerous.</p>
<p>Reynolds is a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.</p>
