<headline>Canada's Avenor to sell Pacific Forest stake.</headline>
<dateline>MONTREAL</dateline>
<text>
<p>Canadian pulp and paper maker Avenor Inc. agreed on Wednesday to sell its 53 percent stake in Pacific Forest Products Ltd. for about C$573 million ($418 million).</p>
<p>Under the deal, Timber Trust, a unit of TimberWest, will acquire Avenor's stake in Pacific Forest for C$29 ($21.17) a share in cash.</p>
<p>A subsidiary of Doman Industries Ltd. will buy Pacific Forest's three sawmills, woodland tenures and related operations from TimberWest for about C$144 million ($105 million), including a proportionate amount of working capital.</p>
<p>Avenor chief financial officer Denis Aubin told Reuters the company expects to record an after-tax gain of C$100 million ($73 million) or C$1.40 ($1) a share in the fourth quarter when the transactions are completed. Net proceeds of about C$300 million ($219 million) will be used mainly to pay off debt, he said.</p>
<p>Definitive agreements on the transactions were to be signed by July 30, while the actual deals were expected to be completed by autumn, the companies said.</p>
<p>Analysts said Avenor appeared to get a good price for its Pacific Forest stake, which had been on the auction block since March when the company announced it was also seeking a buyer for its Gold River pulp mill in British Columbia.</p>
<p>&quot;The values they got are in some respects above our number,&quot; said an analyst who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>Avenor's share price has been rising since its failed merger with financially troubled Repap Enterprises Inc. in late March as markets for its core products, newsprint and pulp, have improved.</p>
<p>In Toronto Stock Exchange trading on Wednesday, Avenor shares rose C35 cents to a new 52-week high of C$29.05, up more than C$10 from their level in December when the company announced its bid for Repap. Avenor shareholders rejected the merger in March.</p>
<p>Pacific Forest was up C25 cents to C$28.15 on Wednesday, while Doman class B shares were down C5 cents to C$9.20.</p>
<p>Avenor is based in Montreal, while Pacific Forest, TimberWest and Doman are based in British Columbia.</p>
