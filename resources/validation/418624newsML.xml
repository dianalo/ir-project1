<p>U.S. spot fuel oil prices again mostly lost ground Monday in lackluster activity, still pressured by weak crude, mild weather forecasts and relatively cheap gas prices, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Crude is weak, gas is cheap and the weather has been warm. There's still a lot of bearish sentiment in the market,&quot; said one cash trader, noting many East Coast utilities recently made the switch to cheaper natural gas.</p>
<p>New York Harbor physical one percent tumbled 50 cents to $15.00-25 a barrel, with March paper sold early at $14.85, then quoted later at $14.75, off 40 cents, traders said.  </p>
<p>NYH April one percent paper also was quoted at $14.65-80, down more than 50 cents on the day.</p>
<p>High sulphurs in New York also lost ground, with 2.2 slipping a quarter to $13.50-75, traders said.</p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour again held steady in the low-$17s, but traders said still-cheap city gate gas prices continued to siphon utility demand.</p>
<p>U.S. Gulf one percent skidded more than a quarter to $14.25, with one trader reportedly offering prompt barrels as low as $14 (FOB Houston). USG three percent was down slightly to $11.75-12.00.</p>
<p>No USG deals were reported.</p>
<p>New York city gate swing gas prices firmed slightly to $2.15/mmBtu, or about $13.55 a barrel equivalent. Gas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, again held steady at about $1.80/mmBtu, or $11.34 a barrel equivalent.</p>
