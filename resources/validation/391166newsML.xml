<p>President Hafez al-Assad met an envoy of the French government on Thursday and welcomed a French and European role in the U.S.-brokered Middle East peace process, his spokesman said.</p>
<p>Joubran Kourieh said Jean Claude Cousseran, director of the Middle East department at the French foreign ministry, conveyed a message to Assad from President Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>&quot;The message dealt with the peace process and the contacts conducted by France in this respect. President Assad gave him a reply message,&quot; Kourieh said.</p>
<p>&quot;Talks during the meeting dealt with France's desire to play a role that would serve the just and comprehensive peace in the region,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Cousseran expressed President Chirac's interest to push the peace process forward and to develop bilateral relations between Syria and France,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Diplomats said the French envoy explained during the meeting that Paris would not make any decision on sending troops to South Lebanon before getting the approval of Syria and Lebanon.</p>
<p>They said Damascus was surprised by reports that France was thinking about sending troops to South Lebanon to guarantee peace in the area between Lebanon and Israel.</p>
<p>French Defence Minister Charles Millon said during a visit to Israel on February 13 that Paris was ready to act alongside other nations including the United States as a guarantor to a possible accord on Israel's border with Lebanon and Syria.</p>
<p>Chirac, who developed strong ties with Assad in a visit to Damascus last year, phoned the Syrian leader on February 11 to assure him of continued consultations with him on any peace moves, the diplomats said.</p>
<p>Sporadic Syrian-Israeli peace talks which opened in 1991 are deadlocked over the fate of the Golan Heights, captured by Israel from Syria in 1967. The last round of talks was held about a year ago.</p>
<p>Syria has condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who took office last year, for refusing to accept a full withdrawal from the Golan.</p>
