<p>Germany ended a 25-match unbeaten streak by the Netherlands when they won their final pool match at the five-nation Golden Jubilee of Pakistan men's tournament on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Germans, who face the Netherlands again in the tournament final on Sunday, came from behind to win the dead pool game 3-1.</p>
<p>It was the first time the Dutch had lost an international since June of last year, before their Olympic triumph in Atlanta.</p>
<p>But Dutch coach Roelant Oltmans was not worried about the defeat. &quot;There is always one match you are going to lose. It would not be good for us to worry about defending an unbeaten run,&quot; he said. &quot;I used the match for team development.&quot;</p>
<p>The result left Germany top of the round robin series, three points ahead of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Netherlands were without Erik Jazet, who was called home for personal reasons, and did not play their captain Stephan Veen in the second half.</p>
<p>Bram Lomans, the Dutch corner specialist who, for a change, had a long outing on the field, put the Dutch ahead from their third corner of the match in the 29th minute.</p>
<p>German under-21 striker Oliver Domke scored a spectacular equaliser with a reverse hit in the 49th minute.</p>
<p>Christian Blunck, the German captain, raced forward to hit a loose ball into goal for Germany's second goal and Domke set up Christian Bechmann for the third.</p>
<p>Australia who play World Cup holders Pakistan for  bronze on Sunday, drew 3-3 with them in their final round robin match.</p>
<p>Australia led three times through Matthew Smith, Jeremy Hiskins and Stephen Davies and missed a chance to go ahead again when a 57th-minute penalty by Davies was saved by Pakistan captain Mansoor Ahmed.</p>
<p>Pakistan's scorers were Rahim Khan, Muhammad Khalid junior and Muhammad Shahbaz.</p>
