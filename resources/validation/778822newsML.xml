<p>Southeast Asia's currency turmoil could result in slower economic growth for the region and that would have an impact on Singapore, Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This year, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has projected five to seven percent economic growth for Singapore. There has been turmoil in the currency markets in our neighbouring countries. This may lead to slower growth for the whole region which will have an impact on Singapore,&quot; Tan said in a speech.  </p>
<p>He did not, however, mention any change in the government's five to seven percent forecast, and said Singapore's &quot;economic fundamentals remain strong&quot;.</p>
<p>Tan defended government measures against property speculation taken last year.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government had not taken action to cool down the property market last May, we may have run into the same problems which are now affecting the Thai property market and the Thai economy,&quot; he said.</p>
