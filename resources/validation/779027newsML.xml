<p>Lucent Technologies said Tuesday that it has signed a five-year, multi-million dollar contract to supply Ameritech Corp.'s Ameritech Cellular Services with wireless equipment.</p>
<p>Specific financial details of the contract were not disclosed but analysts said the deal is worth at least $700 million and potentially more than $1 billion dollars to Lucent over the life of the contract.</p>
<p>&quot;This is one of the largest wireless equipment deals ever,&quot; said Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Joe Noel. &quot;It's worth at least $700 million over five years and could even be over a billion,&quot; Noel said.</p>
<p>Lucent said the contract calls for it to provide 5ESS-2000 Switches and wireless base stations, as well as related hardware, software, and installation and engineering services for the entire infrastructure of Ameritech's ClearPath digital wireless network.</p>
<p>Ameritech launched ClearPath in metropolitan Chicago on July 28. ClearPath will be introduced in Detroit in the fourth quarter, followed by introductions in the Cleveland and Indianapolis service areas in mid-1998. Long-term plans call for ClearPath to be offered in other Ameritech markets.</p>
<p>Lucent Technologies designs, builds and delivers public and private networks, communications systems and software, consumer and business telephone systems and microelectronics components.</p>
<p>At the end of June, Ameritech served 2.9 million cellular customers in six states of the Midwest, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The Lucent equipment will be used to construct a digital overlay network that sits on top of Ameritech's existing cellular network, which is based on older, analogue technology.</p>
<p>In Cleveland and Indianapolis, the Lucent equipment will be used to construct from the ground up entirely new digital networks to offer the latest generation of so-called Personal Communications Services.</p>
<p>Chris Landis, an analyst with industry consulting firm TeleChoice Inc. based in Verona, N.J., also estimated the deal as ranging in value from hundreds of millions of dollars up to &quot;close to a billion&quot; over the life of the deal.</p>
<p>He said the deal was similar to U S West Communications Group's $500 million pact with Lucent for digital wireless networks over a 14-state region, a contract that could run as high as $1 billion as construction is completed.</p>
<p>Lucent's exclusive contract is rare in an industry where phone companies typically prefer to deal with multiple equipment vendors, Hambrecht's Noel said.</p>
<p>Lucent stock closed up $1.1875 at $85.875 while Ameritech lost 93.75 to close at $66.875, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
