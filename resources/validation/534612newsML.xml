<p>Olympic marathon champion Josiah Thugwane is a notable omission from the provisional South African athletics squad for the World Championships in Athens in August.</p>
<p>Announcing the squad in Johannesburg on Thursday Athletics South Africa (ASA) secretary general Banele Sindani said the Olympic gold medallist had already said he did not want to compete in order to allow 'unknowns' to run and the national body would not pressurise him into doing so.</p>
<p>The 1992 Olympic 10,000 metres silver medalist Elana Meyer, who was second behind Ethiopia's Olympic marathon champion Fatuma Roba in the Boston marathon on Monday, has yet to decide whether she will compete in the 5,000 or 10,000 metres events or the marathon in Athens.</p>
<p>She has been provisionally included for the last two.</p>
<p>Colleen de Reuck, who finished one place behind Meyer in Boston, told ASA earlier this month that she wanted to concentrate on the 10,000 metres.</p>
<p>Sindani said the final line up would be announced as close to the IAAF deadline of July 22 as possible and it was possible that other athletes who performed well before then could be included.</p>
<p>The provisional squad is:</p>
<p>Men: Arnaud Malherbe (400m), Hezekiel Sepeng (800m), Marius van Heerden (800m), Llewellyn Herbert (400m hurdles), Riaan Botha (pole vault), Okkert Brits (pole vault), Burger Lambrecht (shot put), Marius Corbett (javelin).</p>
<p>Women: Adri de Jongh (200 and 400m), Gwen Griffiths (1,500 and 5,000m), Colleen de Reuck (10,000m), Elana Meyer (10,000m).</p>
<p>Marathon squads:</p>
<p>Men: Lawrence Peu, Ezael Thlobo, Gert Thys, Xolile Yawa, Martin Ndhiveni, Johannes Maremane, Abner Siphu, Adam Motlagale, Nixon Nkodima, Able Mokibe.</p>
<p>Women: Elana Meyer, Helene Joubert, Grace De Oliviera, Rita Toto.</p>
