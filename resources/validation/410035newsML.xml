<p>Czech Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik revised upwards the government's 1997 inflation outlook on Friday to 9.5 percent after the ruling coalition parties moved to ease Communist era price controls.</p>
<p>Kocarnik said the average rent increase on state-controlled housing, agreed by the three coalition parties late on Thursday, would be about 50 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>The trade and industry ministry earlier said the coalition partners had also agreed to raise value added tax (VAT) on gas and electricity to 22 percent from five percent from July 1.</p>
<p>&quot;(Inflation) should not exceed 9.5 percent (this year),&quot; Kocarnik told a news conference after a cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>Average annual inflation was 8.8 percent in 1996, the 1997 budget was based on a forecast of 8.6 percent by the Czech Statistical Bureau said on February 3 it saw inflation of between 7.5 and eight percent this year.</p>
<p>Deregulation remains one of the most sensitive political issues in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Many Czechs live in apartments with fixed low rents and with energy bills subsidised by imdustrial users but some economists say the artificially low prices boost demand for consumer goods and fuel price rises.</p>
<p>The central bank has cautioned against any excessive rises in controlled prices for fear of a jump in inflation.</p>
<p>Patria Finance chief economist Zdenek Tuma said the bank had recently forecast average inflation of 8.5 to 9.5 percent, depending on the extent of price deregulation.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems the deregulation will be quite sizeable and that (inflation) would go to the upper limit of our estimate so I would agree that on average it would be 9.5 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tuma added that in the second half of 1997, year-on-year price rises could reach 10 or 11 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It will increase inflation in the short term but in the long term it should have a positive impact on th economy,&quot; he said, adding the deregulation could improve prospects for lower long-term price rises by reducing inflationary expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;It is positive news because if we want to reduce inflation within three years substantially, we could get rid of regulated prices or the impact of adjustment of regulated prices.&quot;</p>
<p>A lower inflation differential between the Czech Republic and its trading partners would help Czech producers, he said.</p>
<p>The trade deficit widened in 1996 to 160.3 billion crowns ($5.5 billion) from 95.7 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Both the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, the senior coalition party, and the pro-business Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) support an overall 35 percent rise in energy prices for this year but had been split before the talks on the VAT increase.</p>
<p>The ODS wants to raise taxes to boost budget coffers and the ODA wants the extra revenue to go to energy companies.</p>
<p>Zivnostenska Banka analyst Jindrich Weiss said he expected the overall increase in energy prices to be around 30 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It will mean a little bit lower consumption of other goods, it will put pressure on consumer spending but on the other hand there will be some transfer due to social compensation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The parties in the minority government agreed to make a joint decision on housing and energy deregulation policy in the coalition agreement under which the administration was formed after the 1996 general election. ($ = 29.10 Czech Crowns)</p>
