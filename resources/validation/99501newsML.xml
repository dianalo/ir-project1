<title>RUSSIA: Russia's Livshits hails credit ratings.</title>
<headline>Russia's Livshits hails credit ratings.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-10-07</dateline>

<p>Finance Mininister Alexander Livshits welcomed news on Monday that three prominent credit assessment agencies had assigned Russia ratings in the run-up to the launch of its debut Eurobond.</p>
<p>&quot;It means that the world economic community confirmed its support and its understanding that Russia is moving in a good direction,&quot; Livshits told a news conference.</p>
<p>Earlier in London IBCA announced it had assigned a BB+ rating for Russian long-term foreign-currency debt, S&amp;P said it had assigned a BB- rating and Moody's said it assigned Ba2.</p>
<p>The ratings in case fell below the &quot;investment grade&quot;, yet Russian debt prices leapt in response to the news, as lower ratings had been expected.</p>
<p>&quot;They are below investment grade, which means there is an element of doubt in the stability of the political and economic course, which means that if something happens Russia could default,&quot; a senior Russian official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The ratings open the way for Russia to issue its first Eurobond, which Livshits confirmed would come in the next few months.</p>
<p>&quot;You will see the first Eurobonds issued by Russia by the end of the year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the first issue will be a massive one despite the problems with the budget, but for us prospects on the market are more important than immediate sums of money.&quot;</p>
<p>London bankers expect the first Eurobond to emerge at between $300 and $500 million with a three to five-year maturity in November.</p>
<p>&quot;This is real money, this is quick money, and it's quite big money,&quot; Livshits said.</p>
<p>According to the draft 1997 budget, Russia is planning to raise $1.3 billion in Eurobonds next year.</p>
