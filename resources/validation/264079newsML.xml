<p>Thailand appointed a new national police chief on Wednesday to replace Pochana Boonyachinda, who was removed amid a series of police department scandals.</p>
<p>General Pracha Promnok was appointed the new chief after Pochana was transferred to a post in the prime minister's office, the police commission said.</p>
<p>Pracha, a respected senior officer, will supervise a scandal-plagued department of 200,000 staff.</p>
<p>Thai police came under public scrutiny after allegations that six suspected amphetamine traffickers were shot dead by police for resisting arrest after being handcuffed.</p>
<p>A recent study by the Chulalongkorn University also accused some officers of being involved in prostitution, drug trafficking and gambling.</p>
<p>Deputy Interior Minister Chalerm Yoobumroon said on Wednesday that some police were involved in drug trafficking, particularly amphetamines, and vowed to crack down on offenders.</p>
