<headline>BankBoston opens securities unit after Fed approval.</headline>
<dateline>BOSTON</dateline>
<text>
<p>BankBoston said Wednesday it has formed a subsidiary to underwrite corporate debt securities and some stocks after the bank obtained regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve Board.</p>
<p>Only a small number of U.S. banks have such powers.</p>
<p>BankBoston said BancBoston Securities Inc. will offer enhanced corporate financing options and investments, including underwriting and dealing in high-yield public debt securities.</p>
<p>The unit opened Friday and began its first activity Tuesday, said its new president, Vincent &quot;Val&quot; Mulcahy.</p>
<p>The approval allows the bank to underwrite equity if it is part of a corporate debt financing, he said.</p>
<p>BankBoston said its immediate plans include the opening of its high-yield securities business to underwrite, trade and make markets in public debt securities.</p>
<p>BankBoston said the new unit will serve its historic client base of mostly midsized, non-investment-grade corporate clients.</p>
<p>The unit will underwrite senior and subordinated debt for clients in BankBoston's special industry areas, such as media and communications, energy and utilities, transportation, high technology, environmental services and real estate.</p>
<p>Asked in a telephone interview if the company would seek powers to write stand-alone equity, Mulcahy said, &quot;We want to be sure we can walk before we run.&quot;</p>
<p>BankBoston's stock fell 50 cents to $75.75 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.</p>
