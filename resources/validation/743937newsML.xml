<p>NOTE - Contributors' own analysis follows.</p>
<p>ING BARINGS - The AEX is taking a breather. Last week's fall below near-term support 950 has violated the rising trend channel. Technical indicators are flashing warning signals... All in all the technical picture of the AEX has weakened a bit. But the longer term bull run is still intact, favouring a scenario of buying the dips. If short-term support at 940 gives way on a closing basis, we expect limited downside potential. Then we focus on objectives in the 920-925 range.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO - Outlook remains bullish and we expect market to continue its uptrend. We are targeting 960 this week and expect the AEX to make a fresh attempt soon to regain its former highs.</p>
<p>RABO SECURITIES - After reaching the target at 975 the chart of the AEX index shows a key reversal day. Usually this means at least a slight correction. We expect support to kick in around the 938 and 920 levels where 920 is the level of the former rising resistance line which now acts as support. Do not forget that this is still a bull market and declines are seen as corrections within the longer-term uptrend.</p>
<p>MEESPIERSON - The coming week will be very exciting, with lots of important companies presenting their first-half results. With a possibility of disappointing results and looking at the weakening charts, we advise investors to stay on the sideline.</p>
<p>JAAD - The &quot;tight-stops&quot; really paid off. Bulls are still in the majority. Watch out for nice buying opportunities.</p>
