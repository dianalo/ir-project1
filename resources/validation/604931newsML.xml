<title>RUSSIA: Frozen Russian MinFins revised down to $129,000.</title>
<headline>Frozen Russian MinFins revised down to $129,000.</headline>

<p>The amount of MinFin bonds frozen this month by police total $129,000, not $180,000 as announced earlier, a senior official from Vneshtorgbank, the main MinFin depositary, said on Thursday.</p>
<p>According to a detailed breakdown of frozen bonds, issued by Andrei Remnyov, deputy head of the bank's depositary, police from one precinct had frozen bonds worth $39,000 on May 7, and police from a second had seized bonds worth $90,000 on May 13.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday Remnyov had estimated the amount frozen by the second police group at nearly $140,000, not $90,000.</p>
<p>The total amount frozen is a tiny fraction of the total $11 billion nominal value of MinFin bonds outstanding, but rumours of the moves hit prices in trading on Thursday before the Vneshtorgbank statement allowed them to recover.</p>
<p>Remnyov said Vneshekonombank, the payment agent for the bonds, had stopped handling them on May 14 because of the police action.</p>
<p>There was no explanation why the bonds had been frozen. Last year the authorities froze about $74 million of the bearer bonds, which were subsequently released, because they had been stolen or misused.</p>
<p>Remnyov issued the following bond details:</p>
