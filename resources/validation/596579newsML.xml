<p>Japanese telecoms giant NTT is expected to ring up higher annual profits on the back of a boom in cellular phones and Japan's growing obsession with the Internet.</p>
<p>Analysts say soaring demand for portable phone services and increasing Web traffic will mean Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, with its 99 percent monopoly of Japan's local-call network, will post a rosy set of earnings figures for the fiscal year which ended on March 31.</p>
<p>They expect NTT's parent current profits to rise by 10 percent or more to around 360 billion to 400 billion yen ($2.25 billion to $3.44 billion) for the 1996/97 year, after profit more than doubled in 1995/96 to 328.92 billion yen ($2.83 billion).</p>
<p>Current profit is pretax and includes gains or losses on non-operating activities such as investments in stocks.</p>
<p>NTT will announce parent as well as group-based business results for fiscal 1996/97 on May 23. It will also unveil its forecast for 1997/98.</p>
<p>Growing investment by Japanese firms in digital information, rising phone traffic and a planned restructuring of NTT into a set of leaner companies will keep profits on a rising curve in the future, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Local call traffic will continue increasing at least by 10 percent annually over the next few years,&quot; said Toshiaki Iba, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.</p>
<p>Hironobu Sawake, an analyst at Nikko Research Center, said: &quot;NTT will be encouraged to undertake restructuring to improve its profit margins, following a compromise with the government on a break-up structure for NTT.&quot;</p>
<p>A government decision to break up NTT into three companies under a single holding firm in around 1999 is due to be formally approved by parliament next month.</p>
<p>Analysts say NTT should manage to boost its parent current profit to around 450 billion to 490 billion yen ($2.81 billion to $4.22 billion) in the business year to next March 31.</p>
<p>Riding high on the buoyant business prospects, NTT's share price rose to its highest level so far this calendar year on Monday, standing at 1.08 million yen ($9,300).</p>
<p>Interconnection charges from traditional cellular phone operators are likely to have more than doubled to around 330 billion yen ($2.84 billion) in the just-ended business year, analysts said, providing a major boost to profits.</p>
<p>Charges for connecting competitors' fragmented networks with NTT's local-call network should top 400 billion yen ($3.44 billion) when fees paid by PHS (personal handyphone system) operators and long-distance operators are included. PHS is a new, low-cost cellular phone system developed in Japan.</p>
<p>But NTT's net profit will stay flat on a group basis in 1996/97 because profit from NTT's own cellular phone unit, NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc (NTT Docomo), was wiped out by a loss at an NTT PHS unit.</p>
<p>The result for 1995/96 had been helped by capital gains from the sale of shares in a data communications unit which went public in April 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;NTT's group profit will jump this year and over the next few years, helped by a steady increase in profit at the two units (cell phone and data communications) as well as the parent company,&quot; said Hironori Tanaka, an analyst at Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics.</p>
<p>&quot;NTT, with its solid earnings structure, is unlikely to be affected by rate cuts in long-distance services any more,&quot; he added.</p>
