<headline>Rwandan genocide trial postponed until January.</headline>

<p>The trial of a Rwandan accused of genocide in 1994 was adjourned on Thursday until next year, the latest delay to plague the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;This case will be adjourned until January 9, 1997, to allow the defence to prepare its case,&quot; said Presiding Judge Laity Kama at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in court at Arusha.</p>
<p>It was at least the fifth delay in starting trials in earnest at the tribunal, formed by the U.N. in November 1994 to bring to justice the leaders of Rwanda's genocide earlier that year of up to one million Tutsi and Hutu political moderates.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be another joke,&quot; said a member of a three-man official Rwandan observer mission after the decision. The Rwanda government says leaders of the genocide should face the death penalty, a punishment the tribunal cannot impose.</p>
<p>Jean Paul Akayesu, 43, a former local government leader in Taba commune in central Rwanda appeared in court in Arusha and testified he had appointed American Michael Karnavas as his new defence lawyer.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a new situation you have presented to us,&quot; said Kama from Senegal, the head of the three-judge panel in court.</p>
<p>Karnavas sought a six-month adjournment on Thursday, arguing he was only appointed co-counsel three weeks ago while the prosecution had 18 months to prepare. The prosecution objected to a delay.</p>
<p>Karnavas had some fiery exchanges with the prosecution.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot in good conscience go forward. I am sure the court would agree with me that a postponement is in accordance with court rules. If we want to go forward today and have a kangaroo court we can do that,&quot; Karnavas said.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Honore Rakotomanana disagreed: &quot;We are completely opposed to the postponing of the trial. We could perhaps postpone for one or two days but we should have opening statements today.&quot;</p>
<p>The white U.N. van bringing him from a Tanzanian prison bumped into another vehicle while Akayesu in handcuffs was being unloaded. He was not hurt. Wearing a dark suit, he was led into the court building.</p>
<p>A U.N. official is in Arusha investigating the tribunal amid charges that the slow-moving judicial process to bring to justice genocide leaders has been paralysed by its own staff.</p>
<p>Speaking on Wednesday, the information chief for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda accused Acting Administration Chief George Anderson, a Liberian, of obstructing activity.</p>
<p>&quot;Things have been paralysed by the acting chief of administration. The investigation is ongoing,&quot; said Beatrice Lacoste, confirming an investigator from the U.N. inspector general's office had arrived at the tribunal's headquarters.</p>
<p>Tribunal staff have complained in the past about incompetence among fellow staff, U.N. politics and bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The tribunal, with a budget of $36 million this year, indicted 21 suspects of whom 12 are in custody. Judges had hoped trials in Arusha would show the world mass killings would not go unpunished.</p>
<p>The court hearing on Thursday was largely overshadowed by new ethnic conflict around Goma in eastern Zaire and the plight of more than one million Rwandan, Zairean and Burundian refugees.</p>
