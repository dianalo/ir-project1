<p>French aid organisation Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) said on Tuesday one of its employees had been kidnapped near Russia's breakaway region of Chechnya.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman told Reuters unknown kidnappers had taken Christophe Andre hostage from MSF headquarters in Nazran, the capital of Russia's north Caucasus region of Ingushetia, which borders Chechnya, during the night of July 1 to July 2. She had no further details.  </p>
<p>&quot;A guard at the headquarters, who had been tied up and knocked down by kidnappers, alerted our workers, who lived in another building. Local police are investigating,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Since then we have learnt absolutely nothing about him,&quot; she said. The organisation initially hesitated about making the kidnapping public for fear it could endanger Andre's life.</p>
<p>&quot;We did not know what was better for him, to make it public or not. But today we are informing the media,&quot; she said. There are four foreigners in Nazran working for MSF. Andre is the MSF administrator in Ingushetia.</p>
<p>Two Britons working for another aid organisation were kidnapped in neighbouring Chechnya last week. The Chechen authorities are investigating but there has been no word of their whereabouts or of any demands by the kidnappers.</p>
