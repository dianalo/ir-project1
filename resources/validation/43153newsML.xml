<title>USA: Most IMM currency futures end lower in a free-fall.</title>

<p>Most IMM currency futures closed sharply lower in a free-fall after the U.S. dollar was catapulted through key resistance levels on short-covering, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There were 100 lots pouring in from all directions,&quot; one IMM currency floor trader said. &quot;Most funds got short overnight, so I didn't see them orchestrate any large play today.&quot;</p>
<p>However, December marks breezed through $0.6665 after dollar buying from funds and trend-followers emerged from Federal Reserve governor Janet Yellen's comments.  </p>
<p>Yellen said the the U.S. economy had entered an inflationary danger zone, which strengthened ideas that the Federal Reserve would raise U.S. interest rates at the end of the month.</p>
<p>&quot;The possibility of an interest rate tweak at the end of the month really hasn't hurt stocks,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>However, long-term investors looking to put cash into U.S. assets were absent, as funds and speculators dominated the dollar's rise to 1.5120 spot marks and 110.00 spot yen, traders and analysts said. Those levels correspond roughly to the session lows for December marks and yen.  </p>
<p>December marks fell to $0.6656, while December yen declined to $0.009219, slightly above the contract low at $0.009214.</p>
<p>One U.S. bank sold 2,000 December yen and sold 1,000 September contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen the dollar eclipse through historical resistance at 1.5105 spot,&quot; Randy Donney, director of capital markets research at Pegasus Econometric Group, said. &quot;It's on a worldwind tour.&quot;</p>
<p>The rally through 1.5100 spot marks and 109.50 spot yen has paved the way for further dollar gains, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think the market is definitely onto the scent and we won't going swinging back into th old ranges,&quot; said Donney, who is looking for dollar/marks to test the year's high at roughly 1.5500 spot.</p>
<p>That would put December marks at $0.6497, below its contract low which was set on May 28 at $0.6537. Donney expects dollar/yen to test its yearly high at about 111.15, which is at $0.009124 in December yen.</p>
<p>Expectations of a U.S. interest rate hike have overshadowed any concerns about the developments regarding the European Monetary Union (EMU).  </p>
<p>Traders are awaiting the Federal Reserve's Beige Book on U.S. regional economic conditions. The report will be released at 1200 EDT/1600 GMT on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Canadian dollars held slim gains, with December failing to test resistance at $0.7339 even though spot prices rose through 1.3681.</p>
<p>Sterling futures were slightly lower. On Monday, total sterling volume set a record at 100,500 contracts.</p>
<p>At the end of pit trade, December yen was off $0.000048 at $0.009232, marks off $0.0056 at $0.6660, Swiss francs off $0.0100 at $0.8162, sterling off $0.0026 at $1.5546, Can dollars up $0.0002 at $0.7324, Aussie dollars down $0.0008 at $0.7976.</p>
