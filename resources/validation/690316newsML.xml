<p>Families of 96 football fans who died in a crush at a soccer match in 1989 have been invited to meet Britain's new interior minister on Monday, just before he makes a statement to parliament on the disaster.</p>
<p>The invitation from Jack Straw, confirmed by a spokesman at his Home Office department, led to media speculation on Thursday that Straw may order a new inquiry into the tragedy at the Hillsborough stadium in the northern England town of Sheffield.</p>
<p>A television documentary screened last December claimed to have uncovered new evidence about the tragedy, which happened at a cup semi-final match between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.</p>
<p>The programme revived calls for a re-examination of police conduct at Hillsborough and greater compensation for relatives of the dead, who were all Liverpool fans.</p>
<p>But Straw's predecessor at the Home Office, Michael Howard, said he would not reopen the inquiry unless he was convinced a new probe was in the public interest.</p>
<p>The Home Office spokesman said he could not comment on Straw's view ahead of his statement to parliament on Monday.</p>
