<headline>S.Korea's president faces new calls for apology.</headline>

<p>Angered by President Kim Young-sam's response to demands that he reveal details of his election campaign financing, South Korean opposition parties on Monday demanded an independent probe and an apology.</p>
<p>But the National Congress for New Politics and the smaller United Liberal Democrats stopped short of calling on Kim to step down.</p>
<p>Instead, they warned that unless the president came clean on his 1992 campaign funding, there could be public calls for his resignation.</p>
<p>The two parties allege that Kim's 1992 election was bankrolled in part by the scandal-hit Hanbo Group, and far exceeded legal spending limits.</p>
<p>The accusations strike at the heart of Kim's presidency since he was swept to power on a promise to clean up corrupt politics and his two predecessors were jailed for taking massive kickbacks from businesses.</p>
<p>Last week, Kim was quoted as saying no records of his campaign spending existed, and digging up the issue would only throw the country into further turmoil.</p>
<p>The president called on all parties to show &quot;apologetic feelings&quot; and reform the system of election campaign funding.</p>
<p>His comments did not go nearly far enough for the opposition, which has seized on the issue ahead of presidential elections in December.</p>
<p>&quot;President Kim Young-sam must reveal his presidential election funds and apologise before the National Assembly,&quot; the two parties said in separate statements. If Kim refused, it &quot;could lead to the people asking for a resignation&quot;.</p>
<p>Political analysts said opposition leaders faced a quandry over how far to press the issue since questions had also been raised about their own campaign money.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a catch 22,&quot; said Yonsei University political science professor Moon Chung-in. &quot;If they push too hard and Kim resigns, opposition leaders will face questions on the legality of their own election funding.&quot;</p>
<p>President Kim had been widely expected to issue a public apology and comment on campaign financing after his son, Kim Hyun-chul, was arrested this month on bribery charges.</p>
<p>The opposition alleges that the younger Kim, a key member of Kim's election team, managed millions of dollars of unused campaign funds through business cronies.</p>
<p>Opposition parties also claim that Kim's administration arranged massive loans to Hanbo to repay a political favour.</p>
<p>The collapse of Hanbo's steelmaking flagship in January under five trillion won ($5.6 billion) of debts uncovered a web of corruption linking the group to top presidential aides, politicians and bankers.</p>
<p>Later on Monday, National Congress leader Kim Dae-jung emphasised that opposition groups were not demanding that Kim quit before his single term expires in February next year.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as Kim Young-sam follows our requests, we will help him. We don't want him to face resignation either,&quot; he told a televised news conference.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, state prosecutors on Monday extended for a further 10 days the arrest of Kim Hyun-chul, who has not yet been formally indicted on the bribery and tax evasion charges.</p>
<p>The arrest of Kim's son was the biggest blow yet to his presidency, already in deep crisis since the collapse of Hanbo Steel Co in a sleaze scandal.</p>
