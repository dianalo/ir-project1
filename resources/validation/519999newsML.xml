<headline>IPE gas oil closes firmer, underpinned by heating.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-18</dateline>

<p>IPE gas oil closed $1 a tonne stronger on Friday having been dragged up by NYMEX heating oil.</p>
<p>May ended the session at $163.25 a tonne having gained most of its momentum after NYMEX opened. Only minutes after NYMEX opened gas oil made its intra-day high of $165.00, but prices slipped during the course of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Traders said gas oil was playing second fiddle to U.S heating which was in the energy complex driving seat. Heating oil was up 0.55 cents at 54.55 cents a gallon at 1745 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;Its still heating which is uncomfortably carrying the mantle. It really should be gasoline by now,&quot; said one trader.  </p>
<p>Heating oil was supported by colder than normal weather in the key U.S northeast United States which has resulted in supply tightness.</p>
<p>May gas oil was seen as having good support at $160.00 and fairly stern resistance at $166.50.</p>
<p>June Brent was 28 cents firmer at $17.97 a barrel having drifted off a high of $18.13, achieved shortly after NYMEX opened. Traders said resistance once $18.00 was breached was around $18.05-18.11.</p>
