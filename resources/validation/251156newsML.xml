<p>Anchor Glass Container Corp has decided to support a bid by Consumers Packaging Inc and Owens-Brockway Glass Container Inc to purchase the assets and assume certain of the liabilities of Anchor, Consumers said Thursday.</p>
<p>Anchor, one of the largest producers of glass bottles and jars in the U.S., it owned by Vitro SA. It has been operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since September 1996.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the joint bid, Consumers and Owens-Brockway, an Owens-Illinois Inc unit, will pay US$392.5 million.  </p>
<p>Consumers said the two will also assume certain liabilities specified in a definitive agreement to be negotiated between the parties and acquire substantially all of Anchor's assets.</p>
<p>The payment consists of US$333.6 million in cash and $58.9 million in convertible preferred and common securities of a newly formed Consumers' subsidiary, the company said.</p>
<p>It said Owens has agreed to purchase certain assets of Anchor, including plants in Antioch and Hayward, Calif.; and to assume Anchor's contractual agreement with Adolph Coors Co's Coors Brewing Co.  </p>
<p>The contracts include a partnership interest in the Rocky Mountain Bottle Co.</p>
<p>Owens will contribute about $125.0 million and assume undisclosed liabilities, Consumers said, adding it will provide the balance of the purchase price out of debt financing for which it has commitments.</p>
<p>In its statement on the transacition, Owens-Illinois said it also agreed to provide its glass container manufacturing technology to Consumers Packaging operations in the United States and Canada, including those being purchased from Anchor, subject to reaching an agreement with Consumers.  </p>
<p>The Anchor purchase is subject to, among other things, the execution of definitive agreements between Consumers, Owens and Anchor Glass Container; review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act; approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.; and the closing of previously executed financing commitments.</p>
<p>Subject to such conditions, the transaction is expected to close within 45 days, Consumers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The acquisition of the assets and business of Anchor Glass will firmly establish Consumers as one of the three largest glass packaging producers in the U.S. and Canada.  </p>
<p>&quot;If the purchase were completed today, our combined sales would be in excess of $1 billion,&quot; chief executive John J. Ghaznavi stated.</p>
<p>This transaction is currently expected to favorably impact Consumers' earnings, Ghaznavi continued.</p>
<p>Anchor chairman James Malone stated: &quot;Consumers and Owens' bid offers more value for our assets, as well as the prospect for a faster closing of the sale. I am hopeful that with this decision we will reach an acceptable conclusion to this process.&quot;</p>
<p>On September 13, Anchor filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and announced it was seeking a Section 363 sale of the Anchor assets pursuant to a letter of intent with Ball-Foster Glass Container Co LLC. On October 4, Anchor said it had executed an Asset Purchase Agreement with Ball-Foster for $365 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments, plus the assumption of certain liabilities, and filed a motion seeking Bankruptcy Court approval for the sale subject to higher and better bids.</p>
<p>The Consumers and Owens bid for the company was submitted on December 2. -- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610.</p>
