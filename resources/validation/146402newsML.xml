<p>Pope John Paul, gradually returning to activity after surgery to remove his appendix earlier this month, took part on Sunday in the first public religious ceremony since the operation.</p>
<p>As had been planned, the 76-year-old Pope took part in only the first part of a three-hour service celebrated in the Eastern Byzantine rite in St Peter's Basilica.</p>
<p>Apparently to conserve his strength, he remained in the church for 70 minutes, sitting on a throne to the side of the flower-bedecked main altar in Christendom's largest Church.</p>
<p>The Polish Pope, now in the 19th year of his pontificate, appeared to be in good form but seemed at times tired as he read his homily in Italian and English.</p>
<p>He later delivered his regular blessing and address in a strong voice from the window of his apartments overlooking St Peter's Square to thousands of people.</p>
<p>In both his homily and in the address to the crowd, the Pontiff used the occasion to make an appeal for unity between the Western and Orthodox Churches, which split in 1054.</p>
<p>&quot;We all desire to reach full communion in obedience to Christ's will,&quot; the Pope said in his address to the crowd.</p>
<p>He said he had been comforted during his recent 10-day hospitalisation by messages from Orthodox Church leaders.</p>
<p>Pope John Paul is still recovering from the October 8 appendectomy and this coming week should test the strength of the leader of the world's 960 million Roman Catholics.</p>
<p>The Vatican has said he will now resume private audiences. On Wednesday he is due to begin regular weekly general audiences again.</p>
<p>On Friday he is due to be the lead celebrant at a mass marking the feast of All Saints, which has taken on added significance for the ageing Pontiff because it coincides with the 50th anniversary of his ordination as a priest.</p>
<p>The Pope has invited all priests who were also ordained in 1946 to come to Rome for commemorations on November 7 and 10.</p>
<p>Sunday's ceremony was held to mark the 350th anniversary of the Union of Uzhorod, which sealed the return of the Eastern Orthodox Ruthene Church to union with the Roman Catholic Church after the great east-west split in Christianity in 1054.</p>
<p>It was held in Old Slavonic, English and other languages and includes liturgical rituals not normally used in the west.</p>
<p>Uzhorod was then part of the Kingdom of Hungary.</p>
<p>Like other eastern rite Catholic Churches, the Ruthenian Church worships in an Orthodox liturgy rather than a western, Latin rite but recognises the Pope as its leader.</p>
<p>Members of the Ruthenian Catholic Church now have communites in parts of eastern Europe as well as in the United States and Australia.</p>
