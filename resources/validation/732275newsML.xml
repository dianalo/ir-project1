<title>INDONESIA: Indonesian rupiah tumbles on stop-loss coverage.</title>
<headline>Indonesian rupiah tumbles on stop-loss coverage.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-07-16</dateline>

<p>The Indonesian rupiah tumbled against the dollar in late trading on Wednesday after operators moved to cover stop-loss and short positions ahead of the public holiday on Thursday, dealers said.</p>
<p>One U.S. bank dealer said stop-loss limits at the 2,460 and 2,465 levels were broken, causing operators to cover stop-loss dollar positions in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The dealer said many dollar sellers at the 2,455.0 level returned to the market and covered their positions which sent the rupiah nosediving to 2,470 in the late afternoon.  </p>
<p>Spot rupiah was quoted at 2,473.0/75.0 at 0930 GMT, compared with an opening of 2,455. Its low was 2,474.0.</p>
<p>Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,469.5/72.0 and 2,55.75/56.5, respectively.</p>
<p>Dealers said the relatively sharp fall was also partly attributed to short-covering ahead of a public holiday on Thursday. All markets will be closed on Thursday for the birthday of Prophet Muhammad and reopen on Friday.</p>
<p>They said operators did not want to be caught too short or too long if other markets turned &quot;naughty&quot; on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the fall was not dramatic but stepwise and spreads were relatively narrow compared with previous days.</p>
<p>However, the market remained edgy as the Southeast Asian currency turbulence spilled over onto Latin America countries.</p>
<p>Dealers said liquidity was ample which supported dollar purchases in the spot market but limited swap rises. Overnight money fell to five percent from 13.5 percent in the morning. Overnight swap was at 0.3/0.4 and tom/next at 0.55/0.60.</p>
<p>They said the short-term trend remained unclear as the market was also exposed to regional volatilities.  </p>
<p>One-month swap rose to 20.0/20.5 from 18.0/20.0, two to 38.0/44.0 from 37.0/40.0, three to 57.0/61.0 from 55.0/59.0 and six to 115.0/118.0 from 105/1.09 points.</p>
<p>Bank Indonesia raised its intervention band by one point to 2,377/2,681 and the conversion band to 2,437/2,485 on Wednesday.</p>
