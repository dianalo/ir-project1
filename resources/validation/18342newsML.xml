<p>Singapore's latest industrial data showed a reduction in petroleum output in June as refiners cut production to try to improve profits on basic refining operations.</p>
<p>Refiners said on Wednesday the fall was expected to persist for the rest of the third quarter as they had no plans to raise production until profit margins improved significantly.</p>
<p>June output was down three percent from May and second quarter output averaged 1.4 percent lower than the first quarter, figures released by the Economic Development Board (EDB) on Tuesday showed.</p>
<p>Refiners said the data came as no surprise in the wake of lower production rates after basic refinery processing operations started showing losses in early June.</p>
<p>&quot;We started lowering our crude runs sometime in June and July when margins turned negative,&quot; one refiner said.</p>
<p>Refiners processing Arab Light crude oil were losing about $1.50 per barrel in early June on primary processing, the first and simplest stage of refining crude oil.</p>
<p>Refineries make money by selling refined products at higher prices than they pay for crude oil.</p>
<p>Primary margins have since moved into the black, giving refiners a profit of about 50 cents a barrel. Profit margins on secondary processing are around $3 per barrel.</p>
<p>One refiner said that although profits had returned, refiners were not convinced it would last and they would continue to maintain an average cut of operations of about seven percent.</p>
<p>Shell Singapore, the island's largest refiner, has operated a 200,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) crude distillation unit (CDU) at 80 percent capacity since early August. The same unit was shut in July for a scheduled month-long maintenance.</p>
<p>Mobil Oil has reduced operations by 10,000 bpd to 270,000 bpd since mid-June, while Esso Singapore has maintained a 15 percent cut in runs at its 230,000 bpd refinery since early July.</p>
<p>Most refiners say they expect profits to pick up once Iraq begins selling its crude oil some time in the fourth quarter, which is expected to undermine crude prices.</p>
<p>One refiner said: &quot;Product prices are relatively high but margins are still bad due to the high costs of crude.&quot;</p>
<p>Demand for petroleum in the third quarter is relatively strong, especially for diesel and jet/kerosene. This has translated into firmer prices so far but not profits because the crude feedstock has remained expensive too.</p>
<p>Refiners said improvements to processing margins are more likely to come from a cut in crude prices rather than further increases to petroleum product prices.</p>
<p>Singapore's petroleum sector output was up 7.2 percent In June compared to a year ago. Similarly, this year's second quarter output was 13.5 percent more than last year.</p>
<p>Refining sources said the increase was due to the addition of a 60,000 bpd CDU at its 230,000 bpd refinery last August by the Singapore Refining Co (SRC).</p>
<p>The addition of SRC's CDU, Singapore's newest CDU for six years, raised the island's total capacity to 1.235 million bpd.</p>
<p>SRC is a joint venture between British Petroleum, Singapore Petroleum Co, and Caltex, itself a joint venture between U.S. majors Texaco Inc and Chevron Corp.</p>
