<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton's top Middle East advisers are to meet at the White House on Thursday to assess the status of the peace process after Wednesday's Jerusalem bombing, Clinton's spokesman said.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who cut short an Asian trip to attend, Middle East mediator Dennis Ross and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger are among those who will take part in the meeting, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.  </p>
<p>The meeting, scheduled for Thursday afternoon, followed a suicide bombing attack on Wednesday at a Jerusalem market that killed 15 people and wounded more than 150.</p>
<p>McCurry said Clinton's aides would discuss developments and &quot;next steps&quot; in the peace process and Clinton himself was not expected to attend.</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt very much they will present recommendations to the president at this point. It's more of an assessment meeting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked if Clinton was satisfied with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's statement that he is committed to ensuring a secure environment for Israel, McCurry said: &quot;The president feels the chairman made an appropriate statement, yes, but the president continues to believe that efforts need to be made to strengthen security cooperation.&quot;</p>
