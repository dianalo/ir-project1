<text>
<p>LME copper spent Friday afternoon hovering under its high, ending the week slightly firmer after bouncing from a mid-week test of the downside.</p>
<p>All the other metals ended the day in the negative column, although some made gains on the week.</p>
<p>Copper's Friday afternoon kerb close of $2,368 per tonne, up $16.50, was only marginally higher than the week's opening levels, and Monday's high of $2,379 was strangely alike Friday's peak of $2,375.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, however, prices dived to a low of $2,305 in what analysts called a needed correction.</p>
<p>On Friday, a larger-than-expected stocks fall of 9,675 tonnes emboldened the market to march higher and the premium of cash over three months metals flared more than $15 to end the day at $55/$60.</p>
<p>Despite a last minute flurry of speculative buying on the kerb, apparently to dress up the weekly charts, prices were not able to break above resistance at $2,370/75.</p>
<p>&quot;A close above $2,370 would have been more constructive,&quot; said analyst Robin Bahr of broker Brandeis.</p>
<p>But by the end of the week, however, prices had bumped above the declining 10-day moving average of $2,345.</p>
<p>In aluminium, forward selling for 1998 put a damper on the upside, which for the second successive day stalled at a high of $1,669.</p>
<p>Stocks fell by 5,525 tonnes, but players had been expecting a much larger draw and the disappointment hit prices, which finished $12 lower at $1,657.</p>
<p>The movement on the week was a marginal loss of $9.</p>
<p>Tin slumped by $100 to close at $5,925 after stocks rose by 410 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;This was undoubted attracted by the backwardation earlier in the week,&quot; said Bahr.</p>
<p>The cash/threes spread flipped into a backwardation of $50 during the week, but it quickly deflated, turning around to finish Friday at a $42/$47 contango.</p>
<p>If $5,900 support fails to hold, the next chart level was pegged at $5,870, Bahr said.</p>
<p>Nickel also suffered after stocks rose by 234 tonnes, finishing Friday $85 easier at $7,955, just above its lows.</p>
<p>The market's movement on the week was down from Monday's opening of $8,140, but off a low of $7,855. By Friday's finish, prices had dropped under the 10- and 30-day moving averages.</p>
<p>Lead finished only slightly softer at $692, down from Thursday's $694 and from $697 at the start of the week.</p>
<p>It has been contained by Far Eastern selling on the upside but supported by speculative interest on dips.</p>
<p>Zinc closed the kerb at $1,297, down $8 from Thursday but showing a gain on the week of $9.</p>
<p>The market hit fresh 4-1/2 year highs during the week at $1,307 but failed to sustain it.</p>
<p>Alloy ended the day last indicated at $1,545/55, down slightly from Thursday.</p>
