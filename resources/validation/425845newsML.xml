<p>India finally bowled the West Indies out for 427 on the second day of the first test match on Friday and then made a shaky start to their first innings.</p>
<p>Openers Vangipurappu Laxman and Navjot Sidhu had three narrow escapes in the opening three overs before they finally got off the mark.</p>
<p>By tea, India had reached 22 for no wicket with Laxman on 10 and Sidhu, recalled for his first overseas assignment since walking out on the squad in England last year, on nine.</p>
<p>Earlier, leg spinner Anil Kumble had cleared up the West Indies innings, taking the last three wickets to finish with figures of five for 120 off 42.4 overs. The West Indies had resumed after lunch on 370 for seven.</p>
<p>Before lunch, Carl Hooper completed his seventh test century. Resuming on 87, he took a further 28 minutes to complete it and went on to make 129 before he was caught by Venkatesh Prasad off the bowling of debutant paceman Abey Kuruvilla.</p>
<p>The West Indies, with nightwatchman Ian Bishop partnering Hooper, began at 300 for four and the Indians went wicketless for most of the morning before breaking through three times in the last 35 minutes.</p>
<p>Hooper and Bishop added 57 runs before Bishop was out for 24, lofting Anil Kumble to deep mid-off where Sunil Joshi took a well-judged, running catch.</p>
<p>Hooper followed half an hour later while Junior Murray made just one before falling leg before to Kumble on the stroke of lunch.</p>
