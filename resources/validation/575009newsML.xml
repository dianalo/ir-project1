<p>Foamex International Inc said on Monday that it's subsidiary, Foamex L.P., had commenced tender offers with concurrent consent solicitations for a total of $489.7 million of aggregate principal of public debt with an aim to reduce the company's interest expense.</p>
<p>The consent solicitations will expire on May 23 and the tender offers will expire on June 9, the company said.</p>
<p>The company said that it expects to fund the repurchase with the proceeds of a $480.0 million Foamex L.P. credit facility, a $150 million senior notes offering and cash.  </p>
<p>Marshall Cogan, the company's chairman and chief executive, said that as a result of its refinancing activities, Foamex International expects to achieve annualized interest expense savings of between $8.0 million and $11.0 million.</p>
<p>The company added that it also expects to take a one-time pre-tax charge of between $41.0 million and $47.0 million in the second quarter of 1997. (Corrects to show that charge is pre-tax, not net of tax).</p>
<p>The charge will be related to the early extinguishment of debt, the write-off of debt issuance costs and additional one-time charges related to other aspects of the refinancing, it said.</p>
<p>Foamex expects to complete its refinancing activities by the end of the second quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp is acting as the dealer manager for the tender offers and the consent solicitations, the company added.</p>
<p>Foamex is a manufacturer and marketer of flexible polyurethane and advanced polymer foam products.</p>
