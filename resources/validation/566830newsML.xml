<p>Some 65 percent of major companies across Europe believe the single currency will have no or only minimal impact on the competitiveness of their businesses, according to a report published on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The report, undertaken for accountancy firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International, interviewed directors among the top 1,000 companies in France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. It asked them to assess the impact in the next millennium of a variety of factors on their businesses.</p>
<p>The single currency, with 30 percent seeing it as having a most significant impact on their firms, was still seen as the second most important factor in the coming years, along with finding and recruiting appropriate skilled staff.</p>
<p>The most important threat was the impact of new technology, with 53 percent of respondents naming it as a major challenge in the next millennium. The feeling is greatest in the UK, where some 73 percent of respondents said changing technology will have a major impact on their businesses.</p>
<p>Competition outside the EU was seen as marginally more important than competition from within.</p>
<p>The enlargement of the European Union was seen as relatively unimportant. Only 26 percent of respondents said they believed it posed a threat to their success and competitiveness.</p>
<p>Regional differences were apparent. UK respondents felt more threatened by the single currency, 43 percent seeing it as a major problem. Also, exactly half saw a threat from the year 2000 timebomb for computer systems, compared with the overall four-country average of 34 percent.</p>
<p>In Germany, 67 percent saw a major threat from employment and pension costs, compared with an overall average of 40 percent.</p>
<p>In France, half the respondents saw competition from within the EU as a major threat, compared with the average 40 percent.</p>
