<p>SIMEX Eurodollar futures bucked a recent downtrend to end slightly firmer on Monday on follow-through buying after last week's gains in Chicago.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was reassured by the release of U.S. employment data on Friday showing a slight rise in hourly wages despite a higher than expected increase in non-farm payrolls in February.</p>
<p>Non-farm payrolls jumped 339,000 last month against a revised 247,000 rise in January, while the jobless rate slipped to 5.3 percent from 5.4 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;We might see a couple of days of continued strength on the back of Friday's rally but I'd expect a return to the downtrend by the end of the week,&quot; said a dealer with a U.S. house.</p>
<p>Analysts were divided over the prospects of a U.S. interest rate hike, but many expected the Federal Reserve to act pre-emptively and raise the fed funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.50 percent at its policy-making meeting on March 25.</p>
<p>The dealer said December Eurodollars were likely to be firmly capped at 93.90. They ended at 93.825 against their IMM close at 93.800 on volume of 5,220 lots.  </p>
<p>Euroyen and Japanese government bond (JGB) futures were little changed in listless trade after failing to find any inspiration in the Nikkei's losses.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was also unmoved by news that two of Nomura Securities' directors had been involved in apparently illegal deals, which weighed on Tokyo stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;This kind of news has been coming out of Japan for the last couple of years. There's nothing too shocking about it,&quot; said the trader.  </p>
<p>December Euroyen was quoted at 99.18 at 1110 GMT against its IMM close at 99.19 on low volume of 2,316 lots. June JGBs settled at 125.36 against their opening 125.30.</p>
