<headline>US Southeast power continues to falter on weather.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Spot bulk electricity prices in the U.S. Southeast continued to soften Monday in light trade, pressured by a return of milder temperatures and the absence of traders due to the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the Southeast are expected to hover near or slightly above-normal Tuesday but then climb to about five to 15 degrees Fahrenheit above normal by Wednesday.</p>
<p>Colder air is forecast for the weekend.</p>
<p>Firm, peak power prices into the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) territory for Tuesday tumbled into the $12.00-13.00 per megawatt hour (MWh) range, as compared with the $19.00-21.00 range on Friday.</p>
<p>Firm, off-peak power into TVA was offered at $14.00 and $14.50, but no deals could be confirmed done at those levels. Traders notionally assessed the market at $10.00-11.00. This is compared with Friday's $12.50-14.00 trading range.</p>
<p>At the Georgia/Florida border, firm, peak electricity prices in 16 hour blocks for Tuesday delivery were softer at $20.50-21.75 from $21.50-23.50 on Friday.</p>
<p>Firm, off-peak power for Tuesday at the Ga./Fla. border fell to $14.00-15.00, down about a $1 from Friday.</p>
<p>In Florida, firm, peak prices for 16-hour blocks of electricity were talked in the $22.00-23.00 per MWh range.</p>
<p>As in the power market, natural gas prices along the Gulf Coast pipes fell by about 60 cents to the $3.20s, as buyers in the East relied on ample storage supplies.</p>
