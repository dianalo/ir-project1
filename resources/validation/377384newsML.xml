<p>Women still have little say in politics, making up only 11.7 percent of the world's parliamentarians, a study said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Women continue to be badly represented in parliaments across the world, and the gap in political power between the sexes is wider than in 1985, a survey of the world's 179 parliaments by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) said.</p>
<p>Only six countries -- Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, North Korea, Nepal and the Philippines -- had laws stating that national legislatures must include a minimum percentage of women. But in none of these did the quota came anywhere near the more than 50 percent representation of women in the population.</p>
<p>The number of women parliamentarians around the world has grown by a tiny 0.4 percent since the previous survey in 1995 by the Geneva-based IPU, which groups legislatures and defends parliamentarians subject to civil and human rights violations.</p>
<p>Despite the large number of female party activists, only one out of 10 political party leaders and three out of 10 party board members are women, said the study which surveyed more than 1,000 parties represented in parliaments around the world.</p>
<p>&quot;Women must first achieve equitable power within political parties if they are to close the gap in parliament,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Two of the countries with the largest increases in women's parliamentary seats since 1995 were from the former communist world -- the Baltic republic of Lithuania with 10.4 percent and Azerbaijan in the Transcaucasus with 10 percent.</p>
<p>Others were Spain which had an 8.5 percent increase and New Zealand with eight percent.</p>
<p>Russia made it to the list of countries with the argest falls in women's seats since 1995 with a three percent decrease, sharing the league with Trinidad, Slovenia, Nicaragua and Italy.</p>
<p>Nordic countries had the highest level of female representation in legislatures with an average 36 percent or more. This ratio was the lowest in Arab countries with just two percent, in Asia some 13 percent and in Africa 10 percent.</p>
<p>In the United States, the new House of Representatives had 51 female members out of its 435 total and the senate only nine out of 100.</p>
<p>None of the lawmakers at parliaments in Comoros, Djibouti, Kuwait, Papua New Guinea and the United Arab Emirates were women.</p>
