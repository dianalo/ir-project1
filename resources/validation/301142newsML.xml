<p>South Korea's ruling party on Saturday proposed an open debate with labour leaders over a controversial labour law that has sparked nationwide labour strife, a party spokesman said.</p>
<p>It was the first time the ruling camp extended an olive branch to striking labour unions since the new bill was rammed through parliament on December 26.</p>
<p>It also contrasted sharply with angry face-offs earlier on Saturday, when police trying to arrest strike leaders were turned away by militant workers armed with iron bars.</p>
<p>&quot;We are offering an open debate with union leaders to resolve the labour problem,&quot; the spokesman of the New Korea Party said.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the current problem stemmed largely from misunderstandings and we want to talk to any labour leaders to resolve the matter.&quot;</p>
<p>The government has so far ruled out any compromise with union groups staging wildcat strikes, saying they are illegal.</p>
<p>Before dawn on Saturday, militant workers wielding iron bars blocked police from arresting seven leaders of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, which has spearheaded nationwide strikes in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>The new law ends decades of near-total job security by allowing troubled companies to lay off workers.</p>
<p>The union leaders, for their part, ordered striking union members to ease protests by working intermittently. But one confederation official said the government should first abandon the new labour law if it wanted a solution.</p>
<p>A group of masked workers stood vigil outside Myongdong cathedral where their colleagues earlier rebuffed repeated attempts by plainclothes officers to serve arrest warrants on the confederation leaders.</p>
<p>Confederation president Kwon Young-kil and his six deputies remained under a makeshift tent of sagging plastic sheeting beneath a statue of the Virgin Mary, but the leaders ordered strikers to resume &quot;partial production&quot;.</p>
<p>A confederation spokesman quoted Kwon as saying that the partial production would continue until midnight on Tuesday -- the deadline the outlawed union group gave to the government to scrap the new labour law.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of about 170,000 workers taking part in strikes are partly working at about 150 companies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The labour union put the number of strikers at 26,000.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue to stage protest rallies but we will try to refrain from extreme actions such as a suicide attempt,&quot; the confederation spokesman said.</p>
<p>On Friday a Hyundai Motors worker staggered past ranks of riot police with his clothes on fire during a protest in the southeast city of Ulsan.</p>
<p>The worker, who set fire to himself in an attempted suicide protest against the new labour law, was recovering in a Seoul hospital on Saturday, union officials said.</p>
<p>Hyundai Motors, South Korea's largest carmaker, on Friday shut down its car plant in what unions described as a lockout. Workers had been turning up at the plant each day but had crippled production by working only intermittently.</p>
<p>International pressure on the South Korean government over the law, and its handling of the strikes mounted.</p>
<p>OECD chief Donald Johnston said he was worried about the turmoil and had reminded Seoul's envoy in Paris of the organisation's commitment to human rights.</p>
<p>South Korea became the 29th member of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in December, and the OECD said Johnston used his first meeting with the new Korean envoy to express concern and dismay among its members.</p>
<p>The OECD would review the law on January 22, a statement by the free-market organisation said.</p>
