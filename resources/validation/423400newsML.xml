<title>UK: NWE naphtha paper indicates firmer sentiment.</title>

<p>NWE spot naphtha prices remained depressed with buying interest muted. But forward paper remained firm with the market looking better balanced further out, traders said.</p>
<p>Stronger Far East markets were seen encouraging arbitrage offtake from the Mediterranean and perceptions of strengthening gasoline prices for the spring driving season were expected to pull naphtha prices higher in April.</p>
<p>This sentiment was flagged by a stronger swaps market where March contracts valued around $2.50 higher at $189.50 and April contracts valued around $3.50 firmer at $193.50.</p>
<p>Traders said the only fly in the ointment could be that the firmer forward market was encouraging some players to put additional cargoes into the paper chains.</p>
<p>On the spot market buyers stayed scarce and around three cargoes were showing.</p>
<p>Traders said a Ras Lanuf stem was on offer at around $189 a tonne while two other stems were showing out of the U.K.. Best bids were notionally around $185-$186.</p>
