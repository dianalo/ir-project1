<p>Tens of thousands of mourners gathered at a monument at Dhaka University on Friday to pay homage to six people killed 45 years ago in a demonstration over a language that became the symbol for Bangladesh's independence.</p>
<p>The crowd sang songs and laid floral wreaths at the memorial, called Central Shaheed Minar, or martyrs monument, at one minute past midnight.</p>
<p>On February 21, 1952, police shot dead six demonstrators who were demanding that Bengali be a state language in what was then East Pakistan.</p>
<p>The event became a symbol of unity for the Bengali people, who fought a nine-month war against Pakistan in 1971 that led to the creation of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>President Shahabuddin Ahmed was the first to lay wreaths at the memorial, followed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and ministers and leaders of opposition parties, students, cultural groups, women and children.</p>
<p>Hasina, whose Awami League party led the liberation war in 1971, said unity was again needed to free the country of poverty and hunger.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to remove illiteracy from society and make the people confident and self-reliant to build a prosperous Bangladesh...,&quot; she said in a message marking the day.</p>
<p>Almost 50 percent of Bangladesh's almost 112 million people live below the poverty line and about 68 percent are illiterate.</p>
