<p>(MIPS=mortgage interest payments)</p>
<p>The ONS said there were upward effects on the 12-month rate from motoring costs, clothing and footwear prices and leisure goods' prices. These effects were largely offset by downward pressure from food prices, especially those for non-seasonal food and from costs for fuel and light.</p>
<p>The 1.1 percent gain in clothing and footwear prices was the highest November rise for more than 20 years, the ONS said.</p>
<p>The main upward effect for clothing and footwear prices came from women's outerwear where prices rose more steeply than last November.  </p>
<p>The tax and prices index rose 0.1 percent in November and 1.3 percent year-on-year with the index at 143.1.</p>
<p>The ONS said the budget effects are likely to reduce December's year-on-year RPI by about 0.03 percentage points, the ONS said.</p>
<p>Seasonal food prices generally rise in December, the ONS said. Non-seasonal food prices are likely to include rises in milk prices in December.</p>
<p>Alcoholic drinks are likely to be depressed by pre-Christmas price discounting.  </p>
<p>On housing, the ONS noted a major lender had recently raised mortgage rates but said rate rises by other lenders will not feed into the index until January.</p>
