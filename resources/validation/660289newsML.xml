<title>UK: Fitch rates Spain AA foreign currency AAA local.</title>

<p>Fitch Investors Service said on Friday it had assigned the Kingdom of Spain its AA foreign currency and AAA local currency ratings.</p>
<p>&quot;The capacity to pay debt denominated in pesetas is higher due to the greater degree of flexibility offered by monetary sovereignty and by the government's ultimate control of the banking system,&quot; Fitch said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Fitch said the ratings were based on Spain's comparatively low public debt burden, large and diverse economy, and expected continued implementation of sound macroeconomic policies.</p>
<p>&quot;Although Spain's overall economic situation has been improving and growth in public debt stabilising, greater efforts are necessary to ensure improved creditworthiness. In particular, further progress in the county's credit profile depends on continued fiscal consolidation and additional microeconomic reforms,&quot; Fitch said.</p>
<p>While movement in this direction might be politically difficult it was necessary given the loss of policy flexibility that would occur under European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;Spain's rating strengths include the country's status as a politically stable, modern industrial economy. Spain has benefited from its membership of the European Union (EU) since 1986 by means of transfers from the EU and as a favoured location for foreign direct investment,&quot; Fitch said.</p>
<p>The agency said fiscal consolidation, with the deficit targeted at 3.0 percent for 1997, had resulted in a stabilisation of the overall debt burden and if continued, should lead to a slow reduction in the public debt ratio over the next few years.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the recent drop in the deficit and expected economic growth for this year of 3.0 percent, OECD estimates show Spain's structural general government balance still in deficit. This poses a risk, particularly if economic growth were to slow abruptly in the medium term,&quot; Fitch said.</p>
<p>&quot;Structural rigidities are still significant in Spain. They have led to one of the highest unemployment rates among developed economies and limited economic competitiveness and growth. Further improvements in this area are key to ensuring economic flexibility under the European single currency.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Joining EMU will imply a loss of monetary and exchange rate flexibility and the proposed fiscal stability pact will limit fiscal manoeuvrability. This will leave only the supply side for necessary economic adjustments,&quot; Fitch said.</p>
