<title>LEBANON: Pro-Israeli militia official killed in Lebanon bomb.</title>

<p>A security official of Israel's client South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia was killed on Saturday when a bomb believed planted by guerrillas exploded near his house, SLA sources said.</p>
<p>The sources said Kameel Nimr was killed instantly when the bomb went off near his home in the village of Aishiyeh just inside a border zone that Israel occupies in south Lebanon.</p>
<p>&quot;The bomb exploded as Nimr went out of his house and was heading to his car. He was killed immediately and the blast caused some damage to the house,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known who was behind the blast. Pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) guerrillas have in the past killed a number of SLA officials in similar bomb attacks in the buffer strip.</p>
<p>It was the first SLA fatality in south Lebanon this year.</p>
<p>Six SLA members were wounded in attacks since January 1 against 19 killed by guerrillas in 1996, mainly in roadside bombings against their patrols or in coordinated raids on their posts or patrols using mortar bombs, rockets or machineguns.</p>
<p>Six Israeli soldiers have been killed in similar attacks in the south this year against 27 killed last year.</p>
<p>Hizbollah leads an Islamic Resistance to oust some 1,000 Israeli troops and the 3,000-strong SLA helping them to patrol the 15-km (nine-miles)-deep zone in south Lebanon set up by the Jewish state to stop cross-border raids on northern Israel.</p>
