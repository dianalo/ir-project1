<p>The leader of the Marxist guerrillas holding around 340 hostages at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima is an angry revolutionary with a violent past, police sources said.</p>
<p>Police say former textile factory worker Nestor Cerpa, 43, who uses the nom de guerre Comandante Huertas, is leading about 20 well-armed rebels who took the mansion by assault during a cocktail party on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A man identifying himself as Cerpa spoke by radio to live television on Saturday from the residence promising to continue freeing hostages who did not work for the government.</p>
<p>It was a dramatic public message from Cerpa, the only clandestine chief of the communist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) who has so far eluded capture by police.</p>
<p>His leadership of the embassy attack came as a surprise. Counter-terrorism experts describe Cerpa as an unlikely leader who almost fell into his role and only gained prominence once other, more famous MRTA leaders had been captured and jailed.</p>
<p>But the attack was seemingly very well-planned.</p>
<p>One freed captive, political analyst Carlos Torres, said Cerpa boasted to hostages that the attack on the diplomatic reception was easier than the rebel leader had expected.</p>
<p>Peruvian television broadcast a video of several hooded people -- apparently the guerrillas -- standing around a scale-model of the Japanese ambassador's residence as if they were planning the assault. In the video, one of the hooded figures, perhaps Cerpa, could be seen touching several spots on the model using a pointer. On a wall behind the figures were MRTA banners and slogans.</p>
<p>According to an account in Sunday's Washington Post, the rebels even used a van painted to look like an ambulance to get to the area. They were said to be heavily armed and to have night-vision equipment.</p>
<p>Police say Cerpa's political activities began when he joined a group of union leaders organising workers at the Cromotex textile factory near Lima in 1977.</p>
<p>The factory went bankrupt and its owners tried to close it down. Led by hardline revolutionary Hemigidio Huertas, a group of workers armed with sticks and stones took the premises over and held out for a week, murdering a police captain.</p>
<p>Police stormed the factory to end the siege, killing six workers including Huertas.</p>
<p>Cerpa was arrested and held in jail for 10 months but after release, inspired by his comrade's struggle, he went underground and started to help organise the MRTA.</p>
<p>A string of attacks followed on targets ranging from a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet to a Catholic church. He also led or took part in attacks on a luxury hotel, a restaurant and a newspaper.</p>
<p>After narrowly escaping capture in a house in the northern city of Chiclayo last year, Cerpa shot back into the limelight on Tuesday with the daring assault on the Japanese embassy, using the alias of his hero and mentor Huertas.</p>
<p>It was Huertas who taught the &quot;angry&quot; Cerpa who &quot;never thought of becoming a leader&quot; to dream of revolution 24 hours a day, the sources said.</p>
<p>They added Cerpa was a poorly educated man of humble origins, who took to the armed struggle out of frustration at achieving little political influence as a union leader.</p>
<p>But Cerpa, who failed to win over his shop-floor colleagues, said on Saturday he had won an ideological battle against his glittering array of captives, including foreign diplomats, top government offficials and leading businessmen.</p>
<p>The hostages freed so far in the four-day old siege &quot;are leaving with a different idea of what the MRTA is ... that it is in fact (a group of ) social fighters, that this situation of political violence in our motherland is the product of injustice,&quot; Cerpa said in the radio link.</p>
