<p>An opinion poll on Monday showed France's centre-right coalition heading for a narrow majority in next month's parliamentary elections but found more than one-third of voters could change their minds.</p>
<p>The BVA poll for France 2 television, Paris-Match magazine and Europe 1 radio said that if the May 25-June 1 election were held now, the ruling RPR-UDF coalition would win 296 of the 555 seats in metropolitan France, the Socialists 238, the Communists 18, the ecologists two and the extreme-right National Front one.</p>
<p>The poll, taken on Friday, Saturday and Sunday with a sample of 1,030 registered voters, gave the following voting intentions on the first round: UDF-RPR 39 percent, Socialists and others on the left 28 percent, National Front 14 percent, Communists 10 percent, ecologists seven percent and extreme left two percent.</p>
<p>Seventeen percent of those who said they were certain to vote did not express a voting intention. Of those who did, 38 percent said they could still change their minds.</p>
<p>BVA said its first projection since President Jacques Chirac dissolved parliament last Monday showed that the race was still wide open.</p>
<p>A single percentage point variation in voting intentions for the major parties or the National Front could radically change the outcome, it said.</p>
<p>Two opinion polls at the weekend showed the coalition was likely to retain a comfortable, but sharply reduced, majority after Chirac risked his seven-year presidency by calling the snap poll almost 10 months early.</p>
<p>A Sofres poll for Monday's Le Figaro newspaper showed the RPR-UDF coalition and allies winning around 329 seats, the Socialists, other left and ecologists 202, the Communists 23 and the National Front one seat.</p>
<p>An IFOP poll in Sunday's Journal du Dimanche gave similar results, suggesting the centre-right coalition could be returned with a pared majority of between 311 and 331 seats, with the Socialists taking between 200 and 220.</p>
<p>Socialist leader Lionel Jospin brushed off the conservative poll lead in a radio interview, saying: &quot;The campaign is far from over. A one-point swing is 30 seats, two points is 60 and three points 90 and a changed majority.&quot;</p>
<p>Expert Pierre Giacometti of the IPSOS polling institute said French politics had never been so uncertain.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation has never been so tight...There is a very great instability and uncertainty about voters' behaviour in the second round,&quot; he said.</p>
