<headline>Dutch NAM re-opens German gas compensation claim.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-12-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch gas supplier NAM (Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij) said on Wednesday it would return to court to claim several billion guilders from its German counterpart Brigitta.</p>
<p>Both companies are jointly owned by Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon.</p>
<p>&quot;This move is subsequent to the procedure initiated by the (Paris-based) International Court of Arbitration last summer,&quot; NAM spokesman Frank Duut told Reuters.</p>
<p>NAM originally claimed more than nine billion guilders in the dispute over natural gas finds in the offshore area between the northern Netherlands and Germany.</p>
<p>He said NAM was granted and paid compensation of 3.75 billion guilders but that the court summoned both parties to reach an amiable agreement concerning the rest of the claim.</p>
<p>&quot;This has not succeeded, so the procedure with the court is reopened,&quot; Duut said.</p>
<p>Although NAM is owned by Shell and Exxon, well over half the compensation will go to the Dutch state. The state has received 2.7 billion guilders of the 3.75 billion compensation.</p>
<p>The Netherlands and Germany agreed in 1966 that the proceeds from the gas reserves should be evenly divided.</p>
<p>They also agreed NAM would operate the gas field and would supply Brigitta with the natural gas to which it was entitled.</p>
<p>But in 1991, it was assessed that NAM had delivered 20 billion cubic metres of gas more than Brigitta's entitlement.</p>
<p>Measurements in the late 1980s showed the gas reserves were smaller than previously thought but supplies to Brigitta until that time were based on the earlier, higher estimates.</p>
<p>Duut said he expected the court to take at least a year to reach a decision on the case.</p>
