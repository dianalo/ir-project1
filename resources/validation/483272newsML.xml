<headline>FEATURE - Norma, Cherie go into battle at British election.</headline>

<p>Thirty years ago, the wives of British prime ministers kept out of sight, appearing only to make tea and small talk when visiting dignitaries came to call.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, British politics is obsessed with image and no detail of a prime minister's life -- or that of his wife -- is rated too intimate or insignificant if it might influence voters at the May 1 election.</p>
<p>Britons now know that Norma, wife of Prime Minister John Major, uses teabags more than once and freezes her left-over cheese.</p>
<p>Cherie, wife of opposition leader Tony Blair, is a dab hand at quick family meals and loves knitting sweaters. A photograph of her shopping in a sweater chosen by her husband triggered an avalanche of comment and analysis in the press recently. In the love stakes, John Major believes marrying Norma was &quot;the most significant event of my life&quot;. Tony Blair says he adores his wife and is still deeply in love with her. &quot;I feel the best marriages are based on friendship and Cherie is my best friend,&quot; Blair says.</p>
<p>Despite their political differences, the Blairs and Majors lead similar private lives. The couples are extremely close, are fiercely protective of their children and share the same beliefs in marital fidelity and the importance of family life.</p>
<p>WIVES REPRESENT DIFFERENT VALUES</p>
<p>The women have only met three times and they seem to like each other. But Norma and Cherie represent, not so much two generations, rather ancient and modern attitudes to a wife's role.</p>
<p>The ruling Conservatives are convinced &quot;First Lady&quot; Norma is a vote-winner with middle class women because of her classic family role -- a mother of two who stayed at home supporting her husband while John climbed to the top of the political ladder.</p>
<p>Labour strategists, however, believe Cherie's home life is more relevant to modern Britain. They believe voters are impressed that she can combine her busy life as a top lawyer with raising three children and keeping the home fires burning.</p>
<p>Norma has supported John Major at official and party functions but prefers to remain at home in Huntingdon, central England rather than live in London. John says she is not a &quot;political animal&quot; and they prefer to discuss gardening at home.</p>
<p>But it was her annoyance at continuous attacks on Major and his European policy that persuaded him to stand down as leader in June 1995 and launch a leadership battle he eventually won. Norma has been increasingly drafted into action by the Conservatives as they attempt to overcome a huge opinion poll deficit in the weeks before the election.</p>
<p>Polls show women, particularly older ones, prefer John to Tony Blair and it is hoped the Norma effect will bolster this.</p>
<p>Norma recently gave her first press interviews, six years after John first moved into 10, Downing Street.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic life suits me,&quot; she says. Apart from squeezing the last drops out of tea bags, 54-year-old Norma spent months working on a book on the prime minister's official country house, Chequers, published late last year.</p>
<p>Norma is so good around the house that John used to ring her for help when they were first dating. &quot;All my lights have gone off. What do I do?&quot; he asked once when a fuse blew.</p>
<p>Considered more politically radical than Tony, Cherie took a tentative step into the media world by editing Prima, a cooking-and-hairstyles women's magazine, last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes I think I'm just juggling all the balls in the air and I'm amazed that they don't fall down at once,&quot; she said, lauding the efforts of working mothers and home carers. Prima readers were told Tony was very good at polishing shoes but could not be said to be &quot;intimate&quot; with the washing machine.</p>
<p>ADJUSTING TO PUBLIC LIFE</p>
<p>Both women took a long while to adjust to the public spotlight. Major's elevation to the top job in November 1990 ended Margaret Thatcher's 11-year reign and Denis Thatcher's time in Downing Street.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything was so new and there was nobody to give me any guidance -- it had been a long time since there had been a prime minister's wife,&quot; Norma said.</p>
<p>The press could not resist snide, snobbish attacks on her naivety and her husband's ordinary background.</p>
<p>She got &quot;hammered&quot; for wearing the same blue suit two days running shortly after John Major became leader.</p>
<p>The Blairs live about 20 minutes' drive from Downing Street, but Cherie says the whole family will move house if Labour win the election.</p>
<p>They may take over 11, Downing St from Labour's unmarried finance minister, Gordon Brown, as it has far more living space compared with the two-bedroomed flat above number 10.</p>
<p>If Blair wins, his will be the first young family to move into 10, Downing St since 1945. Cherie will be the first full-time working mother to be married to a prime minister.</p>
<p>&quot;Wherever Tony goes, we are going too. The most important thing is to keep the family together,&quot; the mother of three told Prima. &quot;We want to keep life as normal as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>That's what Norma said in 1990, and Cherie has had enough experience since her husband took charge of Labour in July 1994 to know that life will never be the same if Blair wins.</p>
<p>The daughter of a well-known actor who starred in the television comedy series &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, Cherie was used at an early age to the pressure of fame.</p>
<p>She once complained that she started as the daughter of someone and is now the wife of someone. The 41-year-old has given speeches at conferences discussing battered women but has resisted the temptation to give a formal interview.</p>
<p>This has not stopped the Conservative press sniffing around her past, trying to find evidence she is a closet left-winger at odds with her husband's push to the centre ground of politics.</p>
<p>They have had to content themselves with swipes at her dress sense -- a low point was when she turned up at a horse racing meeting in pixie boots -- and her doting support for her husband in public, complete with fond gazes and an apparently rictus smile.</p>
<p>Cherie has been likened by Conservative newspapers to Hillary Clinton, said by some to be the power behind her husband's throne. But she says she intends to carry on working in law if Labour wins the election. She could become a judge during Tony's five-year term.</p>
