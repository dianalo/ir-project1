<p>New Zealand investment experts on Wednesday gave a cautious thumbs-up to ideas mooted by Treasurer Winston Peters for the structure of a compulsory retirement savings scheme to be put to the country this year.</p>
<p>In particular, they welcomed the proposal of an annuity-based scheme which prevents people from accessing all their savings in one lump sum on retirement.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're broadly comfortable with the principles that he has indicated he is considering,&quot; Roger Gill, chief executive of the Investment Savings and Insurance Association (ISI), told Reuters.</p>
<p>Compulsory superannuation was championed by Peters nationalist New Zealand First party in last year's election campaign but opposed by National -- now its partner in government.  </p>
<p>As part of their coalition agreement the pair decided to put the concept to public vote in a referendum scheduled for September. The final proposals for the design of the preferred scheme should be published in early June.</p>
<p>In a speech to the Association of Investment Advisers and Financial Planners in Wellington on Tuesday, Peters said the scheme was likely to be based around an annuity requiring at least NZ$160,000.  </p>
<p>Once people saved more than the target amount they could stop saving, or take the extra savings as a lump sum. If they had saved less than the target, the amount could be topped up by the state, Peters suggested.</p>
<p>In broad terms, the proposed scheme would see everyone in New Zealand contributing a portion of their income to a personal pension savings scheme regulated by the government -- initially three percent in 1998/99, rising to eight percent by 2002.</p>
<p>The public would be able to invest in government-approved schemes run by the private sector.  </p>
<p>&quot;The two essential features we see is that the fund is locked in till retirement, and that it comes out as a form of an annuity rather than a lump sum,&quot; Gill said.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been some substantial changes... all the stories of withdrawing lump sums and borrowing against your account to set up businesses and so on, that's all out.</p>
<p>&quot;Investment restrictions was the other big thing -- they're out, and there is no requirement that a certain percentage (of contributions) will need to be invested in New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>Paul Fyfe, managing director of fund manager Armstrong Jones, said the scheme outlined by Peters had merit.  </p>
<p>He said there was every indication the current national superannuation scheme was not sustainable in its present form, but the problem could not be solved simply by educating New Zealanders to provide a lump sum for their retirement.</p>
<p>&quot;Otherwise when they get there (retirement) they can give it to Sally and the kids, go offshore, and then put their hand up for national superannuation.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way you can actually fix the problem is to ensure New Zealanders have an annuity that they can't spend in one go.&quot;  </p>
<p>Fyfe said New Zealanders also needed to be informed about the likely future of the current taxpayer-funded scheme if they voted against compulsion in September.</p>
<p>He also said there was a danger people would think they needed to save only $160,000.</p>
<p>&quot;New Zealanders need to save a lot more than that ($500,000 or more) if they want to enjoy their retirement.&quot;</p>
<p>Bruce Dixon, superannuation consultant with Auckland firm W.M. Mercer Ltd, welcomed Peters' confirmation that the government would not guarantee people's savings.  </p>
<p>Dixon said by underwriting the scheme the government would encourage investors to take risks beyond prudence.</p>
