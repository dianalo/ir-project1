<p>The European Commission published embarrassing figures for European Union powerhouse Germany on Tuesday, giving new evidence of Bonn's poor record in implementing the bloc's single market rules.</p>
<p>For the first time, Germany was last in the league table of how much of the EU's legislation aimed at removing remaining national barriers to the free movement of people, goods, services and capital has been turned into national law.</p>
<p>It scored 88 percent compared with the EU average of 94.8 percent, the Commission's figures showed.</p>
<p>Germany's performance in the regular survey has been low for some time, although Austria was at the bottom when figures were published in March.</p>
<p>Italy and France -- like Germany founding members of the EU -- were also shown lagging behind the EU average, at 92.6 and 94.5 percent respectively.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Netherlands and Denmark showed almost perfect figures, each applying more than 99 percent of the 217 single market measures which required implementing measures at home.</p>
<p>The table was published on the eve of a scheduled meeting of EU internal market ministers, due to debate the Commission's draft action plan for completing the single market by the time the single currency is launched in 1999.</p>
<p>A key target of the plan is for member states to apply and enforce properly existing single market rules, for example those affecting government contracts, which account for 11.5 percent of the EU's gross domestic product. Public procurement is a particularly problematic area for Bonn.</p>
<p>&quot;Member states must close the gap between what they say and what they do concerning the single market,&quot; EU Internal Market Commission Mario Monti said last month.</p>
<p>In an interview with German magazine Focus, Monti said it was &quot;extremely important that as a leading force of European integration and monetary union, Germany should once again take up a leading position.&quot;</p>
<p>German officials in Brussels were unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>Separate figures published last month showed that Germany was also the greatest culprit when it came to state aid, granting far more industry subsidies than any other member state.</p>
<p>To step up pressure on offending member states, the Commission wants to publish regularly a &quot;single market scoreboard&quot; showing how well each country is complying with existing rules, including the number of complaints and infringement cases against it.</p>
<p>The Commission launched the single market programme in 1985 to create a huge domestic market to help European firms compete on world markets by removing all barriers to the free movement of goods, services, capital and people in the bloc.</p>
<p>The EU set a December 31, 1992 deadline for completing an original list of almost 300 legislative measures. It almost made it but Tuesday's figures clearly showed continuing problems in applying at national level what has been agreed in Brussels.</p>
<p>Apart from the problem of enforcing existing rules, some single market proposals still await adoption by the EU, for example in the areas of company law, taxation, financial services and the free movement of people. -- Brussels newsroom +32 2 287 68 11</p>
