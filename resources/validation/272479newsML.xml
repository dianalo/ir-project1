<p>Little activity is expected in the U.S. government securities market Tuesday during an abbreviated Christmas Eve trading session.</p>
<p>The only potential market-moving statistical release will be the BTM/Schroders report on consumer spending at 0900 EST/1400 GMT, which investors will watch closely for hints at the strength of U.S. holiday season retail sales.</p>
<p>The Redbook Retail Sales Index also is slated for release, but not until 1455 EST/1955 GMT, well after the Treasury market's 1400 EST/1900 GMT early close.  </p>
<p>&quot;The only market mover could be the Mitsubishi index (as the BTM/Schroders index was formerly known),&quot; said Elliott Platt, managing director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors will be looking for any information on how stores are doing,&quot; Platt said.</p>
<p>Even so, activity should remain muted.</p>
<p>&quot;The trains were empty today (Monday), and by the time Johnson Redbook comes out (Tuesday), people will be on their way home,&quot; Platt added.  </p>
<p>The Treasury Department will make its usual bill announcement, but that is not expected to create any reaction.</p>
<p>Another area of interest Tuesday likely will be prices in the energy complex, which fell Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;People have been concerned about inflation in the energy complex and crude oil was down 50 cents or more Monday -- a factor contributing to some of the gains seen in bond prices,&quot; said Alan Levenson, economist at UBS Securities.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the bulk of market participants' concerns will remain focused on consumer spending, Levenson added.  </p>
<p>While thin trading activity can sometimes exaggerate market movements, few of the players who report for work Tuesday are expected to pay serious heed to any volatility.</p>
<p>Christopher Rupkey, vice president and financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said the market likely will see some early activity following spending data in the morning, but then die down for the remainder of the session.</p>
<p>He saw a repeat of Monday's activity, characterized by an early spurt and then settling in quiet sideways trading the rest of the day.  </p>
<p>Rupkey expected December sales to be up 4.0 percent to 4.5 percent from last year and consumer spending to have risen to about 3.0 percent in the fourth quarter, following a weak third quarter.</p>
<p>However, he discounted the effect prices in the energy sector may have on bond prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's not really that focused on oil prices. It reacted little when they went up and I don't see much of a reaction should they go lower,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Late Monday, the two-year note was 99-27/32, up 1/32, to yield 5.83 percent. The 10-year note was up 7/32 at 101-7/32, to yield 6.33 percent. The 30-year bond was at 99.00, up 12/32 to yield 6.58 percent.</p>
<p>The overnight bank lending or federal funds rate was due to open between 5-1/16 and 5-1/4 percent on Tuesday, traders said.</p>
