<title>USA: Provident Revere unit sued over commissions.</title>
<headline>Provident Revere unit sued over commissions.</headline>

<p>A lawsuit seeking class-action status has been filed against Paul Revere Corp, by insurance brokers who allege that the disability income insurance company denied them millions of dollars in commissions, the plaintiffs' lawyers said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that Paul Revere, beginning January 1995, slashed broker commissions retroactively on premium increases from policies in force before the reduction was announced. The lawsuit seeks treble damages for as many as 10,000 insurance brokers, according to the lawyers.  </p>
<p>The suit, filed in a Worcester, Mass., superior court, alleges that the commission cuts were part of a plan of Paul Revere's former parent, Textron Inc, to improve the insurance company's value before it was sold to Provident Cos Inc.</p>
<p>It also alleges that the cuts violated broker agreements that restrict commission reductions to new policies, and also violates state wage and consumer law.</p>
<p>Textron completed the sale of Paul Revere to Provident for $800 million in March. Textron is not accused in the case; Chatanooga, Tenn.,-based Provident is a co-defendant.  </p>
<p>Tom White, a Provident spokesman, said the company has not seen the lawsuit and cannot comment at this time.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not heard from the brokers, which is unusual if they have any complaint,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said that brokers that deal with Provident are independent producers, with which the company has &quot;some sort of contractual relationship on the business they bring.&quot; But he maintained that Provident does not change commission on such business.  </p>
<p>A spokesman for Textron, a multi-industry holding company in Providence, R.I., was not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>Provident and Paul Revere were also named in a lawsuit filed last month arising from the firing of about 400 career agents and managers.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleged that the terminations breached the company's contract to provide permanent, career-long employment to the agents in return for their commitment to sell full time and exclusively for Paul Revere.</p>
<p>The lawsuit has been amended to include the allegations that the plaintiffs in the case were also denied commissions. The plaintiffs also now seek treble damages.</p>
<p>White said Provident deems the career agents' and managers' case as &quot;without merit.&quot;</p>
