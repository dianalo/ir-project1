<p>The San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to approve the sale of the county's solid waste system to Allied Waste Industries Inc for $184 million in cash, the county said.</p>
<p>The sale may be one of the largest privatizations of municipal assets in the United States, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're pleased to accept Allied's proposal to purchase the county's solid waste assets,&quot; said Bill Horn, chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors.  </p>
<p>San Diego County spokeswoman Carol Conner said the county expected its credit rating to improve as a result of the sale and that its cost of borrowing would go down substantially.</p>
<p>Citing financial problems at San Diego County's solid waste system, Moody's Investors Service Inc last October lowered the county's long-term ratings to Baa1 from single-A.</p>
<p>Moody's said last month that the sale of the solid waste system could boost the county's credit standing.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the sale will help establish an environmental trust fund to manage the county's ongoing solid waste responsibilities, build management reserves and fund some one-time infrastructure investments, the county said.</p>
<p>Under the contract, Allied Waste will take over the county's solid waste system, which includes four landfills, a transfer station, a recycling plant and all county-owned and leased waste bin and container sites.</p>
<p>Allied Waste assumes any future environmental liabilities for the active sites. The county plans to set up a $70 million-plus environmental trust fund for the maintenance of old sites, Conner said.  </p>
<p>San Diego County Chief Administrative Officer Lawrence Prior last month recommended Allied as the winner among the top three finalists contending to buy the system.</p>
<p>Horn said the county would &quot;assist Allied in its efforts to secure the smooth transition of all permits and approvals necessary for the sale to be concluded.&quot;</p>
<p>The county is aiming to complete the sale in November, Conner said. She said the county decided to sell the solid waste system because the public sector was not well equipped to compete in a very competitive private sector industry.</p>
<p>The divestiture process began in December 1996.</p>
