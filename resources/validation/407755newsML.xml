<title>USA: Conrail named in shareholder suit.</title>
<headline>Conrail named in shareholder suit.</headline>
<dateline>PHILADELPHIA 1997-02-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>A shareholder lawsuit seeking class action status has been filed on behalf of certain sellers of Conrail Inc common shares between October 15 and 22, 1996, lawyers for the plaintiffs said Thursday.</p>
<p>The lawyers, Berger &amp; Montague PC and Bernstein Liebhard &amp; Liftshitz, said the suit alleges that Conrail and its chairman, David LeVan, issued false and misleading statements that omitted material facts concerning communications by Conrail suitor Norfolk Southern Corp.  </p>
<p>The suit alleges that the communications concerned Norfolk Southern's interest in a business combination with Conrail, the lawyers said.</p>
<p>Last October 15, Conrail announced an agreement to merge with CSX Corp in a stock and cash deal worth $89 per Conrail share.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that in announcing the CSX deal, Conrail failed to inform its shareholders that Norfolk Southern, over the previous two years and as recently as September and October, had expressed interest in Conrail.  </p>
<p>On October 23, Norfolk Southern disclosed its communications with Conrail and announced a competing bid for the company.</p>
<p>The suit alleges that Conrail stockholders who sold shares at &quot;artificially depressed and suppressed&quot; prices between October 15 and October 22 were injured by the actions and omissions of the defendants.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs are seeking to recover damages suffered, the lawyers said.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment on the suit from Conrail.</p>
<p>The takeover battle for Conrail is currently mired in litigation over provisions protecting the proposed merger between CSX and Conrail.</p>
<p>Both Norfolk and CSX have raised their offers to acquire Conrail. Norfolk, which is pursuing a hostile bid, is offering $115 a share in cash, a deal valued at $10.3 billion.</p>
<p>CSX's bid is $110 per share -- in cash for up to 40 percent of Contrail's stock, and in CSX stock for the rest. The deal is valued at about $1 billion less than the Norfolk Southern offer.</p>
