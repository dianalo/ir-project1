<title>HUNGARY: Budapest shares start weak, watch rates, Wall St.</title>
<headline>Budapest shares start weak, watch rates, Wall St.</headline>

<p>The Budapest Stock Exchange gave up more than three percent in early trading on Monday, dragged down by bearish international sentiment stemming from a fall on Wall Street and fears of a German rate hike.</p>
<p>At 1052 GMT the BUX index traded at 7,573.14 points, down 225.88 points or 2.90 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is inevitably being dragged down by Wall Street and general fears about the developed markets,&quot; said Nigel Rendell, Emerging Markets Strategist at HSBC James Capel in London.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a difficult week because we had the shake on Wall Street on Friday and people think that maybe Wall Street has got further to fall in the short-term.&quot;</p>
<p>Of Central Europe's bourses, Budapest is the most sensitive to Wall Street due to the high proportion of foreign investors.</p>
<p>Rendell added that a possible interest rate hike by the Bundesbank was also keeping markets nervous.</p>
<p>A German rate increase would make the mark firmer against the dollar, while a weak dollar would be unfavourable to those export-oriented companies which invoice their sales in dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not going to be very good for...European sentiment,&quot; he said. &quot;Some of that is obviously brushing off on a market like Hungary and other markets in eastern Europe as well,&quot; Rendell added.</p>
<p>Other analysts said that valuation was also a problem for the Hungarian share market, at least in the short-term and in the central European context.</p>
<p>In a report on Monday, Merrill Lynch downgraded its stance towards Hungarian shares from overweight to neutral due to the market's vulnerability to international market sentiment.</p>
<p>It added Hungary was also less attractive because of its current valuation, which, measured in P/E ratio, is over 50 percent higher than in Poland and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>This morning's fall did not come as a surprise for the markets, with several traders expecting the bourse to head down.</p>
