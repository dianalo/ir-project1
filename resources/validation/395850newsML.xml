<p>Consumer confidence has risen in British-run Hong Kong, which returns to Chinese rule in just 130 days, MasterCard International Inc said on Friday.</p>
<p>The company said its 1996 fourth quarter index on the territory showed it hit a score of 59.1, close to levels of between 60 and 64 reached in 1993 and 1994, and up from its record low of 32 in the second quarter of 1995.  </p>
<p>&quot;The mood in Hong Kong is very positive and this bodes well for the handover,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Hong Kong residents were also very optimistic about income regularity, standing at 84.9, and the economy, at 66.7.</p>
<p>Average consumer confidence in China, at 69.7, was higher than in Hong Kong, with southern provinces scoring even higher.</p>
<p>Confidence level in Guangzhou, in southern Guangdong province, stood at 74.1, with Beijing at 62.5.</p>
<p>Index results were mixed for the rest of Asia.</p>
<p>Malaysia hit 90.4, while Thailand scored 70, up from 53 in the third quarter 1996. Indonesia emerged top scorer at 94, and the Philippines at 83.3.</p>
<p>In Singapore, however, the index took a tumble to 80.6 from 84.5 in the second quarter of 1996, while Japan managed only 20, down from 35 in the second quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Korea nosedived to 15 from 43.7 in the last survey, while India scored 47.2, down 20 points from a year ago.</p>
