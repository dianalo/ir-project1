<p>British airports operator BAA Plc on Monday said it proposed a &quot;noise cap&quot; for London's Heathrow Airport which would limit aircraft noise and be legally binding.</p>
<p>The operator said in a statement the proposal, submitted as part of the &quot;noise evidence&quot; to the Terminal 5 public inquiry, means &quot;the communities around the airport can be reassured that if Terminal 5 is approved the noise levels around Heathrow will not get any worse&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Noise is a serious issue at Heathrow and we are committed to tackling it head on,&quot; said Michael Maine, BAA group technical director and chief policy witness at the inquiry.</p>
<p>He said Terminal 5 would see only an eight percent increase in flights as the number of passengers per aircraft continues to grow. With many of these flights covered by new aircraft with quieter engines and older noisier aircraft not using Heathrow after 2002, BAA is confident it can keep within in the proposed air noise cap.</p>
<p>&quot;We are so confident that we are prepared to accept a legal limit,&quot; Maine added.</p>
<p>BAA also accepts that there be no increase in the number of night flights.</p>
<p>The noise topic at the public inquiry into the delayed 1.5 billion stg project to build a fifth terminal starts in August and is expected to last around 14 weeks.</p>
<p>The BAA proposal is the first time that the operator has put forward a &quot;noise cap&quot; for Heathrow. If the government gives the go-ahead for Terminal 5, BAA expects it to set the cap as part of its decision. BAA would then arrange schedules to fit into the capped noise contour.</p>
