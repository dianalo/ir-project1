<p>American farmers are embracing &quot;biotech&quot; crops as the wave of the future, confident they can woo skeptics at home and abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;Biotechnology is revolutionizing agriculture,&quot; U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told thousands of producers who met for three days at a joint convention of the National Corn Growers Association and the American Soybean Association.</p>
<p>New genetically-altered soybeans and corn are being lapped up by American farmers seeking to raise yields and cut costs by using less pesticides. Policymakers say biotech products are the key to meeting world food needs.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to do more to educate people, to get them confident in our science-based review process and then raise the awareness of the promise of biotechnology to protect our environment and feed our people,&quot; Glickman said.</p>
<p>Agribusinesses are going full throttle on research and development. Officials at DuPont Co unit DuPont Agricultural Products predicted biotechnolgy would become a very big part of the company's $2.5 billion global business in the years ahead.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have a positive story to tell. This industry is just at the beginning,&quot; DuPont's Terry McDaniel said.</p>
<p>Monsanto Co., creator of the herbicide-resistant &quot;Roundup Ready&quot; soybean, estimates those beans will be planted in some 8 million to 10 million acres this season, or about 15 percent INTERRUPTED  </p>
<p>In the United States, consumer groups want biotech products labelled, at least.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumers want to be able to distinguish in the marketplace between products which are bio-engineered and those which are the way nature designed them,&quot; said Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.</p>
<p>Biotech crops in the pipeline will enhance plant value. DuPont will grow a soybean in Iowa this summer that produces an oil that lasts longer and is lower in saturated fats.</p>
<p>Farmers will be able to produce foods that are better tasting and more nutritious through biotechnology, said David Erickson, head of the American Soybean Association.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know how you can be against something that holds such potential for an industry as what biotechnology holds for agriculture,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Financial considerations also underpin the great leap forward. Last year's legislative overhaul of U.S. farm policy removed almost all federal controls on what farmers could grow but also peeled away much of the federal safety net.</p>
<p>&quot;The American farmer under the new farm bill has to become more productive and biotechnology is simply a tool to help him get there,&quot; said Harold Davis, manager for seed and genetics at Terra International Inc  TINP.OB in Sioux City, Iowa.</p>
