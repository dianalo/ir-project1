<title>NORWAY: Norway rebukes Israel, to hold talks with Egypt.</title>

<p>Norway joined Egypt on Friday in criticising Israel's decision to build up settlement areas in the West Bank and said Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa would visit Oslo for talks next week.</p>
<p>Norway has a role as a broker in the Middle East peace process, since it hosted secret meetings between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators that led to the signing of the Oslo peace accord in 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;We are certainly concerned about the Israeli initiative with regard to the settlements,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Ingvard Havnen told Reuters. &quot;We think this is the wrong signal with regard to the resumption of the peace process.&quot;</p>
<p>Havnen said Moussa would visit Oslo from September 4 to 6 and hold talks with his Norwegian counterpart Bjoern Tore Godal and Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland.</p>
<p>&quot;The peace process will be high on the agenda...A major item will be how Norway can best contribute to get the peace process moving forward again,&quot; Havnen said.</p>
<p>Havnen said Norway hoped the revival of talks on Thursday between senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators would lead to a solution on redeployment of Israeli troops in Hebron.</p>
<p>Norway has 20 observers in the West Bank city, where 450 Jewish settlers live among more than 100,000 Palestinians. The mandate for the observers, the only international monitors present, expires on September 12.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a decision from the Israeli side soon. If a solution is found we are prepared to stay and help move the process forward. If there is no solution, the situation in Hebron will be too difficult and we will definitely consider withdrawing,&quot; Havnen said.</p>
