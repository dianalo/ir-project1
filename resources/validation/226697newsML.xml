<p>President Mircea Snegur, facing a leftist rival in the runoff for Moldova's presidential poll, has pledged to sack Moldova's &quot;incompetent&quot; government if he wins a four-year term in Sunday's election.</p>
<p>In a final late-night televised debate on Friday, his opponent, parliament speaker Petru Lucinschi, blamed Snegur for the former Soviet republic's profound economic crisis and denied the president's charge that he wants to restore communism.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli, knocked out in a first round of voting on November 17 has already thrown his weight behind Lucinschi, who is also supported by Moldova's communists, in a contest observers say is too close to call.</p>
<p>The prime minister has said his government will resign after the second round &quot;to preserve civil peace&quot;.</p>
<p>Opinion polls have a poor track record in Moldova, a wedge-shaped country of 4.3 million people between Ukraine and Romania, but a survey published by Russia's Interfax news agency put Snegur almost six points ahead on 52.7 percent.</p>
<p>The survey of 1,267 voters was carried out by Moldova's Opinia pollsters and published on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sangheli has warned Snegur's followers may cause trouble before the vote and Lucinschi said in a statement on Friday that Snegur might use the police to influence the vote.</p>
<p>The speaker has also referred to a bloody 1992 conflict with Russian-speaking separatists against Snegur, who is backed by nationalists who favour closer ties with ethnic kin in Romania.</p>
<p>But both contenders seemed content to play down this issue in Friday's debate, the last before Moldova's first multi-candidate presidential vote. Many hope the poll will end a stand-off between branches of power and dispel doubts on reform.</p>
<p>At first sight, Snegur, president since independence in 1991, and Lucinschi have much in common -- both are 56, come from peasant stock and were top communists in Soviet days.</p>
<p>But the clashes, in a dirty campaign that has shocked many locals, have polarised Moldova.</p>
<p>Snegur, placing himself on the centre-right, wants to speed up market reform. But he says this means acquiring more presidential &quot;prerogatives&quot; -- which his rivals say could be a step toward a showdown.</p>
<p>&quot;One of my first steps will be to dissolve this incompetent government,&quot; Snegur, who won 39 percent of the first-round vote, said on Friday. &quot;I will get talks moving with the World Bank and other international lenders to speed up market reforms.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to change many things but all my intiatives were blocked by the government and parliament.&quot;</p>
<p>Lucinschi, a wiry intellectual who came second with 28 percent, presents himself as a social democrat and hotly denies Snegur's accusations of an unholy union with the communists.</p>
<p>&quot;Are communists enemies of the people? They will vote for Lucinschi only because they are against Snegur,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>After the Soviet Union collapsed, the 700,000-strong Dnestr region broke away in 1990 fearing its mostly Russian-speaking residents could be reduced to second-rate citizens in a possible merger with Romania.</p>
<p>Hundreds died in a conflict in 1992, which was ended by Russian troops, 6,000 of whom are still in the Dnestr region.</p>
<p>Lucinschi advocates openness to the West but wants close ties with Russia, Moldova's main supplier of fuel and energy.</p>
<p>Snegur, however, is at pains not to alienate the one-third Russian-speaking minority -- &quot;No one is talking today about a merger with Romania,&quot; he said in a radio broadcast on Saturday.</p>
