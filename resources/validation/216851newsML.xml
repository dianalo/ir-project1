<p>A senior U.N. official said on Tuesday some Rwandan refugees might start moving home from refugee camps in Tanzania following the flood of 500,000 from eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>Sergio Viera de Mello, U.N. humanitarian coordinator to the Great Lakes region, said he would fly to Tanzania in a few days after visiting Uganda, Kenya and Burundi to assess the mood in the Tanzanian camps, which have half a million Rwandan refugees.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether I see something happening in Tanzania, the answer is not yet. But I haven't been there since September and want to go to sense the mood, the mind set in the camps,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;My guess is we could detect movement soon,&quot; he told Reuters in the Rwandan capital Kigali, saying one element would be the example of those who had returned safely from Zaire.</p>
<p>He declined to say what else might provoke refugees in Tanzania to leave but said President Banjamin Mkapa had made it clear to him a week ago that Tanzania wanted all Rwandan and Burundian refugees there to leave in the near future.</p>
<p>&quot;But the exact timing of the return was something we could discuss,&quot; said de Mello, adding however that Mkapa assured him that Tanzania would never use force to push the refugees out.</p>
<p>&quot;We (the U.N.) will do everything we can to contribute to that, but obviously in an organised manner without increasing the burden the Rwandan government will have to carry on top of the large-scale return from eastern Zaire,&quot; said de Mello.</p>
<p>Like the more than one million in eastern Zaire before an estimated 500,000 swept home in five days from November 15, the 530,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees in Tanzania fled there in 1994.</p>
<p>They have resisted campaigns to coax them back because former Rwandan Hutu troops and Interahamwe militiamen hold sway in the camps and many fear reprisals for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.</p>
<p>The refugees who trekked home from Zaire left only after attacks by rebels forced their Hutu intimidators to flee. But the former troops and Interahamwe, who led the 1994 genocide, have also herded large numbers of refugees deeper into Zaire.</p>
<p>The U.N. envoy said the Tanzanian government assured him it would do everything possible to stop Burundian Hutu rebels forced out of eastern Zaire from crossing to western Tanzania.</p>
<p>De Mello said aerial reconnaissance for the large numbers of refugees and displaced Zaireans still in eastern Zaire was providing &quot;patchy and contradictory information&quot; and insecurity was a major problem in getting food and any other aid to them.</p>
<p>&quot;Security is something we will need to assess area by area, province by province...But everything we hear is not very encouraging on security,&quot; said de Mello, who was appointed three weeks ago to coordinate the U.N. response to the crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;I am convinced that we should not create a (new) camp environment and provide them with indefinite emergency assistance...which in my opinion aggravates, rather than resolves, the problem,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said the first U.N. mission from Kinshasa to eastern Zaire last weekend failed to find large masses of people but was unable to go too low in case its aircraft came under fire.</p>
<p>De Mello said he had been surprised by the success so far of the reintegration of the returnees from Zaire in Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think many governments could have coped with half a million returnees in five or six days the way this one did,&quot; he said. &quot;This is to their credit. In the long-term we will have to see.&quot;</p>
