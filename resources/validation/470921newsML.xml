<p>The Hong Kong stock market took Tuesday's U.S. interest rate increase in its stride on Wednesday, with analysts expecting corporate earnings growth and property prices to remain strong.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates for the first time in more than two years on Tuesday, bringing the federal funds rate to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority responded with a 25 basis point rise in Liquidity Adjustment Facility rates, bringing the LAF bid rate to 4.25 percent and the offer rate to 6.25 percent.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index was down 60 points, or 0.47 percent, at 12,772 in late afternoon trade.</p>
<p>&quot;A quarter percentage point does not really have much impact on earnings and also we expect earnings growth will become faster on the back of improving economic activity,&quot; said Ben Kwong, director of research at Dharmala Securities.</p>
<p>He expects earnings growth of about 15 percent in Hong Kong this year.</p>
<p>Analysts said the property market was also likely to be unaffected. Property stocks have a weighting of about 30 percent in the blue-chip Hang Seng Index.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we have sufficient genuine end-user demand to keep property prices pretty well-supported where they are,&quot; said Abhijit Chakrabortti, senior strategist at Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>He said mortgage rates were below their historical average at prime plus 25 basis points to prime plus 50 compared with a past average of prime plus 125 to prime plus 175.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's prime rate stands at 8.50 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The mortgage interest rate outlook is still reasonably supportive and given that we expect strong increases in wage growth, I don't think a 25 basis point move will do too much to the property sector,&quot; said Chakrabortti.</p>
<p>But analysts said there was some concern the U.S. Federal Reserve had embarked on a series of tightenings which would impact corporate earnings growth.</p>
<p>&quot;If we see continued increases in interest rates in the U.S. it will hurt Hong Kong, it will take the steam out of the Hong Kong market,&quot; said HG Asia investment strategist Jake van der Kamp.</p>
<p>&quot;Another 25 basis points would start to have a little bit of an impact,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we basically got the feeling that it was going up again in May, your fair value for the market would deteriorate, your earnings power would deteriorate,&quot; Chakrabortti said. &quot;If you had 50 basis points (in total) it would become vulnerable to an extent and if you have 75 basis points very vulnerable.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex Tang, head of research at Yamaichi International, said he expected another rise of 25 basis points in May and another 25 basis points during the second half of the year.</p>
<p>But he said companies exposed to the Chinese market should find themselves protected.</p>
<p>&quot;China does not have any inflationary pressure -- inflation keeps falling and interest rates are also coming down and the China market is still booming,&quot; said Tang.</p>
<p>&quot;The rate hike in the U.S. might affect some Hong Kong listed companies but it will not affect H-shares and some of the red chips since they rely on the China market,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>H-shares are stocks of Chinese incorporated companies listed in Hong Kong.</p>
