<p>Egypt's sole brewer, al-Ahram Beverages/ABC, said on Tuesday it was steadily making up the production shortfall it inherited when the new managers bought the firm from the state on February 18.</p>
<p>At a presentation for international investors 100 days after privatisation, the company said it expected to meet its financial year 1997 earnings estimates despite the shortfall, to be followed in 1998 by a substantial increase in profits.</p>
<p>It did not give its own estimates but it quoted consensus figures of 11.3 pounds ($3.33) per share for 1997 and 13.1 pounds for 1998, averaged from separate estimates by HSBC, Nomura and UBS. The company has 4.5 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to meet fiscal 1997 earnings estimates although the government (public-sector company) budget did not foresee the installation of new lines during the peak season... We are projecting substantial increase in profitability for fiscal 1998,&quot; a company statement said.</p>
<p>The shares were trading on the Egyptian stock exchange on Tuesday at 129.26 pounds and global depositary receipts, equivalent to half a share, on international markets at $20.</p>
<p>Reporters were excluded from the detailed financial presentation but the figures made available showed that between March 1 and June 15 sales of beer were 1.9 percent above the old government target for the period and sales of non-alcoholic beer 18 percent above the target.</p>
<p>The shortfall inherited was 45,000 hectolitres of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beer and the company has made up more than 8,000 hectolitres since privatisation, the figures showed.</p>
<p>ABC executives said a newly recruited sales force of 30 people had targeted the Cairo area and this is where the initial sales drive has had most impact.</p>
<p>The company says its strategy is to increase profitability by finding new customers and retail outlets which the old public-sector company ignored.</p>
<p>It says one priority is to consolidate its dominance of the market before two potential competitors start producing beer.</p>
<p>Bruce Blackwell, vice-president for sales and distribution, said his sales team had found that of over 12,000 accounts in the Cairo area only 534 were selling the company's beer.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got an incredible opportunity in alcohol,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The new management team is led by Ahmed Zayat of the Luxor Group, a private U.S. company. ABC has brought in technical experts from Danbrew, the technical consulting arm of the Danish brewer Carlsberg.</p>
