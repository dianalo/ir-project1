<p>Sonaca, a Belgian niche player in the aircraft components industry, hopes Europe's Airbus super-jumbo project will generate generous orders, helping it to pull out of a tailspin.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect many important orders for the coming Airbus A3XX,&quot; Christian Jacqmin, managing director of Sonaca, told Reuters in a recent interview.</p>
<p>While the A3XX passenger jet is the key for Europe's Airbus Industrie to stay in the high-capacity market, Sonaca needs the 500-seater plane to keep it ticking over.</p>
<p>&quot;Sonaca, with three new production units, will be born again in 1998 to become the first partner of Airbus in the manufacturing of aircraft wings components,&quot; Jacqmin said.</p>
<p>It wants to become the leading European supplier in its niche -- so-called leading edge moveable wingparts.</p>
<p>&quot;We must forget the bad years for our European aeronautical industry in 1993, 1994 and 1995. We can't be absent from the aeronautical new products markets of the beginning of the 21st century,&quot; Jacqmin said.</p>
<p>Sonaca is eyeing a slice of estimated annual growth in the market for passenger jets of $55 billion until 2015.</p>
<p>Future demand for planes seating 400-plus passengers will account for $254.1 billion, or 22.7 percent, of the total aircraft market, according to Boeing statistics.</p>
<p>Sonaca, which has been an Airbus partner since the European project started at the end of the seventies, returned to profit in 1996 thanks to a drastic restructurating plan and an important increase of orders for Airbus.</p>
<p>Sales to Airbus rose by 13 percent to 1.784 billion francs. That is more than half total 1996 sales of 3.145 billion francs in 1996, up a &quot;spectacular&quot; 23 percent on 1995, Jacqmin said.</p>
<p>Last year's profit was 32.4 million francs after a loss of 650 million francs in 1995.</p>
<p>Jacqmin expects turnover to reach four billion francs in 1999 and five billion francs in the year 2000.</p>
<p>In the near future Sonaca will continue to make wing compenents for all Airbus jets.</p>
<p>In 1997 and 1998 the company will add components for 92 Embrear 145 (50 seat) and 135 (35 seat) aircraft.</p>
<p>Jacqmin said Sonaca's well-filled orderbook should allow it to limit planned redundancies to 250 by the year 2000, down from an original 650. The 400 are expected to go through natural wastage.</p>
<p>Sonaca is building new manufacturing and assembly areas as part of a complete reorganisation of its production processes.</p>
<p>&quot;We must increase our productivity, reduce costs and halve manufacturing and delivery times to keep customers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sonaca started out as Avions Fairey in 1931, set up to build the Fairey Firefly fighter plane for the Belgian Air Force.</p>
<p>Under licence it later made Hawker Hunters and shared in the production of the Dassault Mirage. That prepared it for its role in a multinational venture to make General Dynamics F-16s.</p>
<p>After Fairey was restructured in 1978 and the government of Wallonia, southern Belgium, where it is located, acquired an equity stake, it was renamed Sonaca and a civil aviation branch was developed, leading off with Airbus orders.</p>
<p>Sonaca is now part of a batch of Belgian aeronautical components manufacturers, including Sabca -- annual turnover six billion francs and Techspace Aero -- annual turnover seven billion francs.</p>
