<p>A farmhand used the proceeds from stolen pigs to lavish tips on dancers at strip clubs and offered one $3,000 to pay for breast implant surgery, authorities said Friday.</p>
<p>In sentencing Darrel Voeks, 38, to a 10-year prison term on Thursday, Outagmie County Circuit Court Judge Dennis Luebke said he was &quot;a thief by habit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are self-indulgent. You are narcissitic,&quot; Luebke said at the sentencing, adding Voeks should pay restitution of more than $100,000 to the farming family who had hired him.</p>
<p>Voeks, who was already on probation for prior pig thefts, pleaded that he was trying to pay bills for his ex-wife and children. But the court heard that receipts showed much of the money went to dancers at strip clubs where he was known as a big tipper.</p>
<p>One stripper said Voeks offered to give her $3,000 for breast implant surgery.</p>
