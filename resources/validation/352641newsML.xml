<p>Singapore front-month gas oil swaps were steady late afternoon on Monday after a large early day slump as the market found support at the $25.00-per-barrel mark, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is holding at the $25.00 level, there is some support at that level,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Gas oil swaps were last quoted at $25.00/$25.10 per barrel down sharply from Friday's $25.75/$25.85, but it was largely unchanged from this morning.</p>
<p>The market traded in the morning at $25.00, brokers said.  </p>
<p>March was last quoted at $25.60/$25.70 per barrel from Friday's $26.40/$26.60 in active trade. Several lots were traded at between a morning high of $26.00 per barrel and at $25.57 late this afternoon, brokers said.</p>
<p>The market's collapse was triggered by falls to futures in London where February Brent crude lost 66 cents to close at $22.52 per barrel on London's International Petroleum Exchange while February gas oil was down $2.75 per tonne to $209.25 on Friday.  </p>
<p>The falls were carried into trading in New York where heating oil closed down 1.69 cents per gallon on NYMEX on Friday and continued to slipped downwards on the afterhours ACCESS where it lost another 61 cents to last trade at 65.55.</p>
<p>Traders said the market is also berish due to the ample availability of physical cargoes on talks that at least two cargoes were diverted from China to Singapore due to buyers' reluctance to take delivery.</p>
<p>In the physical market on Friday one 150,000-barrel cargo traded at $25.30 per barrel free-on-board Singapore--a 40 cent discount to prevailing swap prices.  </p>
<p>Fuel oil swaps were quoted down at $98.00/$99.00 per tonne, down about $1.50 from Friday. The market traded this afternoon at $99.00 per tonne.</p>
<p>Naphtha was down sharply in line with the big falls to crude prices with February buyers seen at $24.20/$24.60 per barrel from Friday's $24.85/$25.10 per barrel, one broker said.</p>
