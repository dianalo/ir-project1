<p>Repairs to the Chechen section of an oil pipeline running from the Caspian Sea to Russia's Black Sea export outlet of Novorossiisk could be completed in 20 to 30 days if necessary financing were raised, a Chechen oil official said on Monday.</p>
<p>Khozhakhmed Yarikhanov, president of the Southern Oil Company, or YUNKO, and Chechnya's highest oil official, was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying that a third of the work on the route had already been completed by YUNKO.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chechen part of the Caspian-Novorossiisk oil pipeline could be restored within 20-30 days if we get financing of two million dollars,&quot; Interfax said, attributing the remarks to Yarikhanov.</p>
<p>He gave no more details of where the finance may come from.</p>
<p>His remarks follow the signing in Moscow earlier on Monday of a peace deal between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Aslan Maskhadov, leader of the independence-minded north Caucasus region.</p>
<p>Yarikhanov was quoted as saying that the signing of the peace deal would accelerate the process of repairing the damaged oil pipeline, which Chechnya hopes will be a hard-currency earner from transport tariffs soon.</p>
<p>He also said that the question of guaranteeing the safety of oil running along the Chechen section of the pipeline had been looked at by Maskhadov with law-enforcement organisations.</p>
<p>The pipeline is part of a Russian export route linking the Caspian with world markets in southern Europe.</p>
<p>Some early oil produced by the multi-billion-dollar international consortium, the Azerbaijan International Operating Co (AIOC), is due to move along the Russian pipeline route which passes through Chechnya.</p>
<p>AIOC has a deal with Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft to carry its oil to Novorossiisk by the beginning of October.</p>
