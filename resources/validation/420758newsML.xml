<title>ALBANIA: Albanian army withdraws after clash with rebels.</title>
<headline>Albanian army withdraws after clash with rebels.</headline>
<dateline>SARANDE, Albania 1997-03-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Albanian army, in its first clash with insurgents near the Greek border, retreated on Wednesday after four villagers and at least two soldiers were wounded in the fighting, eyewitnesses said.</p>
<p>&quot;Eyewitnesses just told us that the battle is over and the troops withdrew,&quot; Dimitris Stefos, the former prefect in this southern Albanian port, told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;The fighting lasted about 40 minutes and at least two soldiers were wounded,&quot; he added. Hospital officials said they were treating four villagers for gunshot wounds received during the fight near Styari, 10 km (six miles) east of Sarande.</p>
<p>It was the first encounter between the Albanian insurgents and army regulars in the border region since anti-government rioters seized Sarande and nearby villages over the weekend.</p>
<p>Rioters burned and looted, and stole thousands of arms from state arsenals. Security force fled from the region, leaving the masked and armed insurgents to roam the streets.</p>
<p>The Albanian parliament declared a state of emergency on Sunday and issued an order to security forces to shoot any armed insurgents on sight.</p>
<p>One of the wounded villagers said that several truckloads of soldiers had taken up positions on a hillside near Styari early on Wednesday morning. Styari is between Sarande and Delvine, 20 km (12 miles) to the east.</p>
<p>Armed groups from Sarande rushed to reinforce the Styari villagers and the fight ensued. The soldiers retreated in trucks towards Delvine, eyewitnesses said.</p>
<p>&quot;The people won. The army, about 60 soldiers, got in their trucks and drove away,&quot; Stefos said.</p>
<p>During the fighting an Albanian fighter plane swooped over Styari and three columns of thick smoke could be seen rising from a nearby hillside.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether the Russian-designed MiG fighter had bombed the village or been shot down -- as claimed by insurgents leaving the area.</p>
<p>Near Sarande, armed gangs seized an army tank from its crew and drove it gleefully through the streets, eyewitnesses said. About a dozen tanks had taken up positions at key junctions in the area during the night but had let traffic pass normally.</p>
<p>A Reuters photographer said several hundred heavily armed rebels had set up a defence line at the entrance to Sarande, and said they were determined to take on the army whatever the cost.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither (President Sali) Berisha nor the army will pass us without a fight to the finish,&quot; one of the rebels on the hilltop said.</p>
<p>Anti-government riots swept southern Albania at the weekend and rioters seized an array of weapons from state arsenals. They looted stores and burned down warehouses throughout the region, where there is a large ethnic Greek minority.</p>
<p>Some 300 to 400 local rebels at the entrance to Sarande carried assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. They had dug in with anti-aircraft guns and heavy machineguns.</p>
<p>Albania has been rocked by anti-government protests and violence since January when five &quot;get-rich-quick&quot; investment schemes collapsed, wiping out millions of dollars in savings.</p>
<p>Protesters have blamed Berisha for letting the unregulated schemes flourish and for failing to warn investors of the risks. Berisha said it was a hard lesson in capitalism and blamed the violence on the country's former communists.</p>
<p>The latest round of violence has caused alarm in Washington and European capitals because of its proximity to the Greek border and because of the ethnic Greek community in the region.</p>
<p>Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis spoke by telephone with Berisha during the night and called on him to protect the ethnic Greeks.</p>
<p>Greece has expressed concern over the rapidly deteriorating situation, called on Berisha to set up a government of national unity and warned the violence risked destabilising the southern Balkans.</p>
<p>Albania emerged from eastern Europe's most ruthless and isolated Stalinist country in 1990 when the communist party founded by dictator Enver Hoxha collapsed.</p>
<p>Greek military and police have been increase on the border, with about 100 riot police sent to the Kakavia border crossing on Wednesday. But the defence ministry has said its forces were not on any special state of alert.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Albanians streamed across the border after communism fell in 1990 and Greece estimates about 350,000 Albanians, mostly illegal workers, are in the country.</p>
<p>Albanians in Greece send home some $400 million each year and a considerable part of that was put in the pyramid schemes which failed early this year.</p>
