<p>U.S. researchers are trying to track down genes that could lead to the development of drugs to help alcoholics kick their habit, New Scientist magazine said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Scientists already know that genetic makeup seems to play a part in causing alcoholism and that children of heavy drinkers are more likely to suffer bad withdrawal symptoms such as severe hangovers, convulsions and trembling.</p>
<p>But Kari Buck and colleagues at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland have tested mice to try to track down the genes responsible for the unpleasant side effects.</p>
<p>&quot;If we could detect genes early, we might be able to warn someone before they start drinking,&quot; she told the magazine.</p>
<p>Her team used 21 strains of related mice bred with two different alcohol tolerances. They injected them with alcohol and then tested the severity of symptoms on an eight-point scale.</p>
<p>They also tested the mice with DNA probes corresponding to segments around the mouse chromosomes and used statistical analysis to identify chromosome segments that contributed to stronger withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>&quot;The researchers concluded that severe withdrawal symptoms are linked to mutations of genes on small regions of mouse chromosomes 1, 4 and 11,&quot; New Scientist said.</p>
<p>Enoch Gordis, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in the United States, said the research was particularly interestng because once the equivalent human genes are found it could help chemists design drugs to correct the effects of the mutations and relieve the symptoms of withdrawal.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a good example of how the study of addiction genetics is stewing and cooking very rapidly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Buck added that her research could also apply to withdrawal symptoms from substances other than alcohol.</p>
