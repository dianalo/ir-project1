<p>Iran, immersed in religious mourning for the past month, plunged deeper into gloom on Wednesday to mark the death eight years ago of the Islamic revolution's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</p>
<p>Government offices, shops and businesses closed for the day, flags flew at half-mast, and no newspapers were published.</p>
<p>Black flags and banners gave the streets a sombre air.</p>
<p>Tehran radio broadcast excerpts from Khomeini's speeches, epic poems and funereal music, and Iranian television showed archive footage from the turbulent days of the 1979 revolution to the chaotic scenes at his funeral 10 years later.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of mourners gathered at Khomeini's mausoleum at Beheshte-e Zahra cemetery south of Tehran to pay homage to the Shi'ite Moslem clergyman who inspired the revolution against Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.</p>
<p>The scene was a multitude of mostly black -- the men in black shirts and the women covered in black chadors, the shapeless shroud that conceals all but the face.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to the anniversary officials and religious figures reiterated their continued commitment to Khomeini's moral and political heritage. But there has also been an undercurrent of debate between various factions in the speeches and eulogies.</p>
<p>Conservatives have stressed that the Islamic state set up by Khomeini reflected God's will, but moderate president-elect Mohammad Khatami has highlighted the late Imam's ability to mobilise the people as a key element of government.</p>
<p>Khatami, elected by a landslide two weeks ago, has also insisted that his own campaign themes of reinforcing civil rights and providing opportunities for women are inspired by Khomeini's thought.</p>
<p>&quot;In the thought of the late Imam, the forgotten or unknown lights of the people have been revived,&quot; Khatami told a meeting held to discuss Khomeini's thought and movement.</p>
<p>&quot;In this movement the human being has rights and is not only one who gets orders from above and is obliged to carry them out.</p>
<p>&quot;The late Imam recognises that people have a right to decide their own destiny and to intervene on the social scene, and this light has the advantage of being common to men and women,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Khomeini died at the age of 86 on June 3, 1989, 11 days after surgeons removed a cancerous third of his stomach. But his death was not announced until the following day, the eve of another anniversary in the struggle against the Shah, and June 4 is observed as the anniversary.</p>
<p>He is revered in revolutionary Iran as an imam or saint and credited with reviving Islamic thought in the country.</p>
<p>Before the revolution Khomeini had lived in exile for 15 years, mostly in Iraq but also in France for a few months immediately before his triumphant return to Iran.</p>
<p>The U.S.-backed Shah had fled Iran early in 1979 and died the following year in exile in Egypt from cancer.</p>
<p>At Khomeini's tumultuous funeral in Tehran, hysterical mourners dragged his body from its coffin and tore at his shroud. Revolutionary Guards intervened, lifted the body back into the coffin and whisked it to safety by helicopter.</p>
<p>His tomb is in a mosque whose gold dome and four minarets are a prominent landmark by day and a bright beacon by night.</p>
<p>Iran, the world's largest Shi'ite Moslem country, has been in mourning for the last four weeks -- Muharram in the Islamic calendar -- for the death in battle 13 centuries ago of the Prophet Mohammad's grandson Hussein, which established the Shi'ites' rivals the Sunnis as Islam's dominant tradition.</p>
<p>On Thursday Iran will commemorate the day in 1963 when thousands of demonstrators confronted police to protest against Khomeini's arrest after he made a fiery speech denouncing the Shah and his government's corruption.</p>
<p>The day, known as the 15th of Khordad Uprising after its date in the Iranian calendar, was the first mass action inspired by Khomeini and foreshadowed the 1979 revolution.</p>
