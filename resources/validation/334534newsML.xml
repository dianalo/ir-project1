<p>A Russian man tied up, tortured and beat to death three family members and repeatedly raped his 13-year-old sister-in-law after a quarrel, a Moscow police spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>He said the killer, a 27-year-old driver, was arrested late on Sunday after the 13-year-old escaped her four-day ordeal in which he ran amok with a metal pipe and a kitchen knife.</p>
<p>The murderer had clubbed to death his parents-in-law, who were in their 40s, and his wife's 63-year-old grandmother.</p>
<p>He also stabbed his 23-year-old wife 10 times and she is now critically ill in hospital. The victims were found at his apartment with parts of a metal pipe and a bloody kitchen knife nearby, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The sister-in-law managed to escape when the killer left the apartment after the murders. She had been raped in the victims' presence, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Criminal investigators said the murderer had no history of mental illness and did not have a criminal record. They said he had tied up his victims after a quarrel with his wife in which her relatives had sided against him.</p>
