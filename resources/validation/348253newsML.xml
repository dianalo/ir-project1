<title>GERMANY: Porsche profit triples after early 1990s woes.</title>
<headline>Porsche profit triples after early 1990s woes.</headline>
<dateline>STUTTGART, Germany</dateline>
<text>
<p>Porsche AG said Friday its profit for the first half of its 1996-97 business year had more than tripled.</p>
<p>The German car maker also said it had signed a deal with Finland's Valmet Oy to help meet surging demand for its Boxster roadster.</p>
<p>Porsche, proclaiming it was back in the fast lane after hard times and weak sales in the early 1990s, said profit rose to 36 million marks ($22 million) in the six-month period to January 31 from 10.3 million ($6.25 million) in the same 1995-96 period.</p>
<p>Sales jumped 20 percent to 1.7 billion marks ($1.04 billion) as deliveries rose 25 percent to 12,800 vehicles, of which 3,150 were Boxsters, Porsche's first completely new car in two decades.</p>
<p>The six-month results prompted Porsche chief executive Wendelin Wiedeking to predict at the group's shareholder meeting that Porsche would top the 1995-96 business year sales of 2.8 billion marks ($1.7 billion) and net profit of 48.1 million marks ($29.3 billion).</p>
<p>Shares in Porsche gained sharply on the results, advancing 140 marks to 1,510 marks in midday bourse dealings, a 10 percent gain that clearly outpaced the broader German market.</p>
<p>Porsche said demand for the two-seat roadster was so strong that it planned to crank up production in a deal with Valmet to build at least 5,000 of the vehicles from autumn 1997.</p>
<p>Demand is predicted to keep rising only as the Boxster is offered into new markets, including February in America where Porsche wants to double its 1997 sales to 14,000 vehicles.</p>
