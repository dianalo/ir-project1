<p>The lawyer of former Argentina World Cup player Alberto Tarantini said on Tuesday her client was not a drug addict and was innocent of charges of trafficking.</p>
<p>The defender in Argentina's 1978 World Cup winning team was arrested in a weekend drugs swoop on a flat in an upper-class Buenos Aires district. Police, who also detained his 21-year old woman companion, said they found cocaine in his possession.</p>
<p>&quot;He was not carrying drugs,&quot; said his lawyer Elena Tarubi. She admitted on local radio that Tarantini was voluntarily submitting himself to drug treatment, but said, &quot;He does not admit that he is a drug addict. He is not dependent on drugs.&quot;</p>
<p>Police say they suspect Tarantini, who played for Argentine clubs Boca Juniors and River Plate before playing in England, France and Switzerland, of organising a drugs ring operating in Buenos Aires discotheques.</p>
<p>But Tarantini alleges the police planted drugs on him. The former player was also arrested in March for possession of the drug &quot;ecstasy&quot; but was freed 10 days later on the grounds that it was for his personal use.</p>
<p>&quot;I am innocent and I don't consume or sell drugs,&quot; Tarantini said on Monday as he was taken by police into a judge's office, &quot;They did the same thing to me that they did to me last time.&quot;</p>
<p>He declined to testify.</p>
<p>Tarubi said that Tarantini had no need to get involved in drugs smuggling, and that he made enough money for his needs working in the import-export business.</p>
