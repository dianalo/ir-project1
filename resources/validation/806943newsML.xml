<p>More than 54,000 immigrants unsure of their legal right to live in France have asked the new leftist government to let them stay on, far more than expected, the Interior Ministry said on Monday.</p>
<p>The government, which took power in June, announced as one of its first steps that it would begin a case-by-case review of an expected 40,000 requests for residence papers from immigrants finding themselves in legal limbo.</p>
<p>The large number seeking to clarify their status is certain to fuel rightist arguments that Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin erred in agreeing to review their situation.</p>
<p>Conservative President Jacques Chirac has charged that the initiative would encourage more illegal immigrants to come to France, aggravating the country's 12.6 percent unemployment and thus feeding racist sentiment.</p>
<p>Conservative ex-interior minister Jean-Louis Debre predicted the review would bolster the fiercely anti-immigrant National Front, the extreme-right party led by Jean-Marie le Pen.</p>
<p>French officials have already begun reviewing immigrants whose status was unclear.</p>
<p>Most of the cases are due to revisions in immigration law carried out under the previous rightist government. The changes deprived thousands of individuals of the legal right to remain in France while failing to give the state the power to expel them.</p>
<p>The Jospin government said it was in the national interest to allow these immigrants to stay if they were spouses of French nationals, spouses of foreigners residing legally in France, children of foreigners residing legally in France, foreigners who are seriously ill or students pursuing advanced studies.</p>
<p>Also allowed to remain in France would be individuals who would be in serious danger if they returned to their country of origin or longtime foreign residents who have been well integrated into French society.</p>
