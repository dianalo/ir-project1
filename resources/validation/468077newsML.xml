<p>Northern Ireland-based packaging company Boxmore International Plc said on Tuesday it anticipates turnover and profit margins will remain under competitive pressure in 1997.  </p>
<p>Boxmore, which recorded a 29 percent rise in pre-tax profits to 14.32 million sterling in 1996, said the company would address this pressure in a positive manner.</p>
<p>The company said its operating profit in 1996 was ahead by 34.3 percent on a turnover which was up 23.1 percent to 88.47 million sterling.</p>
<p>Boxmore said 1997 should continue to show growth in world-wide demand for its products.  </p>
<p>But it said that some European governments would be forced to restrict expenditure in their struggle to meet the Maastricht criteria for entry to Economic and monetary union (EMU) and this would result in reduced demand for some of Boxmore's packaging products.</p>
<p>&quot;Other non-European outlets are being developed to compensate for this decline,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>However, Boxmore said it remains confident of long-term European growth in demand for its products and its immediate focus for expansion by acquisition will be mainland Europe, although it will continue to progress well-researched joint venture opportunities beyond that continent.</p>
<p>The company said all its divisions had made significant progress during 1996 manifested by an increased share of the home market, expanded business overseas and the establishment of important trading partnerships.</p>
<p>Boxmore said turnover in the pharmaceutical and healthcare division had increased by 42 percent in 1996 to 38.25 million sterling.</p>
<p>Satisfactory profitable growth in this division was sustained by capital expenditure of over 5.6 million sterling while raw material prices tended to ease during the year and may remain soft for most of 1997, it said.</p>
<p>Boxmore said its umbrella organisation Boxmore Healthcare Packaging (BHP), which commenced trading in the early part of the year, continued to increase its sales of cartons, labels, leaflets and thermoform trays to the healthcare industry.</p>
<p>Boxmore said had it acquired Glaxo Wellcome's in-house packaging company GPS last July, and at the same time it had negotiated a five-year agreement for the supply of BHP's products.</p>
<p>It said the restructuring on acquisition of GPS had resulted in a 400 increase in leaflet production which was projected to more than double during 1997.</p>
<p>The company said turnover in its food and drink division had increased by 18.3 percent to 28.13 million sterling.</p>
<p>Capital expenditure of 5.3 million sterling was undertaken by this division in response to strong customer demand, it said.</p>
<p>It said a major event during the year was the official opening of a new South African joint venture plant in September 1996 and it added that it is confident that 1997 will bring continued progress there.</p>
<p>Boxmore said turnover in its barrier and other containers division had increased by 4.8 percent to 15.79 million sterling.</p>
<p>It said the investment of 5.0 million sterling in new plant and buildings had been made in 1996 and this investment had enabled it to launch new products, improve its competitive position and increase exports.</p>
<p>Boxmore said its investment in a joint-venture agreement to produce barrier containers in the Pacific Basin region, where production is planned to commence during the latter part of 1997, would be in the region of 3.5 million sterling.</p>
