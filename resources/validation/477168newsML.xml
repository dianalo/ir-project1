<p>Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma, weighing competing claims to power, will almost certainly give the ruling United Front coalition a chance to try to prove its majority in parliament, experts said on Monday.</p>
<p>Sharma was expected to shelve, at least temporarily, a claim by Congress party president Sitaram Kesri to form a new government in the world's most populous democracy.</p>
<p>Kesri abruptly announced on Sunday that India's oldest party was revoking support for Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's 10-month-old ruling coalition.</p>
<p>The 77-year-old Congress chief formally staked his party's claim to govern on Monday, a Congress official said.</p>
<p>The Congress decision to withdraw support for Deve Gowda threw the government and financial markets into turmoil as the 15-party United Front ruling alliance had depended on Congress backing to survive.</p>
<p>The United Front, which ranges from free traders to communists, controls at least 178 votes in the 545-seat lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha -- well short of a majority.</p>
<p>Congress has stood outside the government but propped up the coalition with its 140 votes.</p>
<p>Congress finished an embarrassing second in general elections last year, trailing the rightwing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which emerged as the biggest single group in the Lok Sabha with 194 deputies but short of a majority.</p>
<p>The Indian president's powers are severely limited but he can play a crucial role in the event of a hung parliament.</p>
<p>Last May Sharma named BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee prime minister. Vajpayee resigned within 12 days after failing to muster enough votes to win a vote of confidence.</p>
<p>Sharma then turned to Deve Gowda, who had emerged as a surprise nominee of the newly established United Front.</p>
<p>The political glue holding the United Front and Congress together has been mutual distrust and fear of the BJP, which they accuse of stoking communal tension by favouring majority Hindus over Moslems.</p>
<p>In addition, neither the United Front nor Congress are eager to tempt fate now by going to the polls.</p>
<p>That reluctance could help the United Front to keep its constituents in line and draw support from at least some Congress lawmakers who do not want snap polls, analysts said.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda said on Monday that there was no question of his resigning or calling for the dissolution of the lower house.</p>
<p>&quot;The trial of strength will be held on the floor of the house,&quot; the Press Trust of India quoted Deve Gowda as saying.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda's clear-cut stance appeared to leave the president with little choice, constitutional experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Constitutional precedent is clear,&quot; said lawyer K.K. Venugopal. &quot;If the prime minister wants an opportunity to prove a majority, the president would give him the opportunity.</p>
<p>Said Ashis Nandy of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies: &quot;The president is bound to ask Deve Gowda to prove his majority.&quot;</p>
<p>Provided the United Front, whose leaders were to meet on Monday, continued to back Deve Gowda, the prime minister would have to win more support than his opponents in a vote of confidence but not necessarily an outright majority, said Pran Chopra of the Centre for Policy Research think tank.</p>
<p>Parliament was set to reconvene on April 21 to consider the 1997/98 (April-March) budget drafted by Deve Gowda's government. The session could be moved up for a test vote.</p>
<p>If Deve Gowda lost the confidence vote, the president could ask another leader to try to form a government or request the Lok Sabha to elect its own leader, experts said.</p>
<p>If no new ruling coalition emerged, he could then dissolve the house and call mid-term elections.</p>
