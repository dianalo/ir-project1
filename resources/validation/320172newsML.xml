<p>Interbank rates were mixed in very quiet trading on Monday ahead of today's U.S. market holiday, dealers said. Overnight cash rose to 4-7/8 3/4 percent from 4-5/8 9/16 percent and three-month money was a touch lower at 5-7/16 5/16 against 5-1/2 7/16 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Market sentiment is a bit cautious on fears that U.S. officials may come up with some remarks about interest rates at the FOMC meeting in February,&quot; a Japanese dealer said.</p>
<p>But the market generally believed the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee), the Federal Reserve's policy arm, would leave monetary policy unchanged at its next meeting, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Some Japanese banks have asked for one- to three-month money to prepare for Chinese New Year holidays starting in early February but lenders were few, one dealer said.</p>
<p>Trading in Exchange Fund bills and notes was thin as U.S. Treasuries failed to provide any direction on Friday.</p>
<p>One week Exchange Fund bill yields eased to 4.38 percent from 4.47 percent.</p>
<p>Yields on the three-year note fell to 6.19 percent from 6.21 on Friday, while five-year note yields were 6.65 percent versus 6.70 percent and seven-year at 6.88 versus 6.94 percent.</p>
