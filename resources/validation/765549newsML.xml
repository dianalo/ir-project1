<p>A woman distance runner was dropped from the German team on Wednesday for doping as the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) began what is expected to be an emotional drugs debate on the opening day of its two-day congress.</p>
<p>German Athletic Federation officials said Petra Wassiluk, 27, a 10,000 metres runner, had tested positive for excessive amounts of the stimulant caffeine in Spain last April.</p>
<p>The Germans axed Wassiluk from their team even though her ban would have finished by the start of the championships.</p>
<p>IAAF sources also said a Norwegian hammer thrower had tested positive for steroids and a Syrian athlete had tested positive for banned substances. They said neither athlete had qualified for the sixth world championships starting here on Saturday.</p>
<p>As news of the latest dope cases emerged, a leading international athletics official said a number of countries were adopting a hypocritical attitude towards doping.</p>
<p>The official, who declined to be identified, said the offending nations claimed they were major anti-doping campaigners but were themselves soft on drug abusers.</p>
<p>&quot;What they do here is like dressing the shop window by speaking out against drug abuse,&quot; he said. &quot;Then they protect their athletes. The problem at the moment is not what ban is imposed but that doping is still going on world wide.&quot;</p>
<p>European athletics officials have proposed that the compulsory ban for serious drugs such as steroids be cut from four to two years because the longer sentence is regarded as too tough under the civil law of some countries.</p>
<p>Britain was expected to be one of the main opponents of the change when the debate resumes on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;If the British stand up and make a big speech they could get a lot of votes,&quot; one IAAF official said.</p>
<p>IAAF officials also discussed on Wednesday whether to abandon three-month bans for stimulants and replace them with a formal warning. A second offence would then result in a longer ban.</p>
