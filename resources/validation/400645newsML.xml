<p>President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique called on Tuesday for an end to landmine production when he opened an international conference on the issue.</p>
<p>More than 300 activists from non-governmental organisations all over the world are attending the meeting in Maputo, which aims at building support for an international treaty banning landmines to be signed in Ottawa in December.</p>
<p>&quot;We appeal to the producing countries to stop the manufacture, transport, sale and use of mines,&quot; said Chissano.</p>
<p>The conference is co-hosted by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and an independent Mozambican association with the same aim.</p>
<p>&quot;We support this movement with all our vigour and look forward to the total eradication of mines from the planet,&quot; said Chissano.</p>
<p>Conference organisers said there were still about one million uncleared landmines in Mozambique -- relics from wars between 1964 and 1992 --  which are still maiming and killing people.</p>
<p>The Mozambican campaigners against landmines said they had collected more than 100,000 signatures on a letter to Chissano calling for a ban.</p>
<p>Some delegates told Reuters they were disappointed that Chissano had not pledged to sign the Ottawa treaty.</p>
<p>Others noted that under Mozambican law his decision would have to be ratified by parliament. Chissano's Frelimo party has a majority in parliament, but ratification is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>One influential Frelimo deputy, Sergio Vieira, recently defended the use of landmines in some circumstances in his weekly column in the Maputo newspaper Domingo.</p>
<p>Graca Machel, widow of Chissano's predecessor Samora Machel, supports Chissano politically and is a strong advocate of the treaty banning landmines.</p>
<p>Graca, who has a romantic relationship with mine-banning proponent South African President Nelson Mandela, is chairing the Maputo conference and called for the southern African region to be mine-free by the year 2000.</p>
