<title>AUSTRALIA: Investment managers hit Australia tax changes.</title>
<headline>Investment managers hit Australia tax changes.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-06-06</dateline>

<p>The Australian Investment Managers Association (AIMA), the peak representative body of the Australian investment management industry, said tax changes in the recent federal budget could hurt Australian capital markets.</p>
<p>The AIMA said the budget's measures to prevent trading in dividend franking credits &quot;profoundly impede the international competitiveness of Australia's capital markets&quot; and exposed the savings of all Australians to undue investment risks.  </p>
<p>&quot;Although apparently targetted at financial arrangements which exploit Australia's dividend imputation system, the new measures will penalise a range of legitimate investment practices which are in no way tax-driven and which are intregal to the prudent management of Australians' superannuation (pension) and other savings,&quot; the AIMA said.</p>
<p>On top of the market and risk implications, the AIMA said the changes announced in the 1997/98 (July/June) budget would:</p>
<p>- disrupt the mechanisms through which key benefits such as diversification and management of risk are delivered to investors by professional investment managers  </p>
<p>- create arbitrary anomalies in the taxation treatment of some investors compared to others, and;</p>
<p>- impose a highly complex and costly administrative burden on all participants in the investment management industry, and, by extension, their clients.</p>
<p>&quot;Ultimately, small investors will be the big losers under these measures,&quot; AIMA chairman Charles Macek said in a statement accompanying the release of a discussion paper on the changes.</p>
<p>&quot;Either they will have to forego taxation benefits if they wish their investments to be protected, or they will be exosed to significant market risks,&quot; Macek said.  </p>
<p>&quot;These risks may in turn far exceed any benefits delivered by measures such as the much-heralded savings rebate or other policy measures in the areas of consumer protection and supervision of financial institutions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a national tragedy if the safety of ordinary Australians' investments were to become jeopardise by restrictions on prudent risk management techniques,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The AIMA said its members collectively manage about A$360 billion of assets, of which about A$100 billion is invested in Australian equities. The A$100 billion represents about 45 percent of available capital of listed companies in Australia.  </p>
<p>The divident imputation system, introduced in 1988, ended double taxation of corporate dividends. Investors can claim a tax rebate on dividends received from share investments to the extent that tax has already been paid by the company.</p>
<p>The system operates by the attachment of &quot;franking credits&quot; to dividends paid by companies which are used by shareholders to reduce their tax liabilities arising in other areas.</p>
<p>The AIMA said the changes announced in the budget, which are not yet passed into law, would significantly restrict the circumstances under which investors including superannuation funds can gain the benefits of franking credits.  </p>
<p>&quot;As there is no counterbalancing tax relief in other areas, the net effect will be an increase in the tax payable by Australian investors, and a reduction in the value of investments that could otherwise be devoted to purposes such as the accumulation of retirement savings,&quot; the association said.</p>
