<p>A week of floods has killed at least 104 people in Bangladesh, including 19 who drowned after a boat capsized in a swollen river, officials and police said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said the 19 people missing for four days after the boat sank on the Sangu river were now believed to have drowned.</p>
<p>&quot;We can no longer keep them on the missing list although their bodies have not been found yet. It's now certain that they have perished in the river,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>Most of the other victims died in landslides and house cave-ins, police said. The death toll could rise further as detailed reports had yet to be received from many cut-off areas.</p>
<p>&quot;Floodwaters have started receding in most of the 19 affected districts and we expect conditions to improve soon,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>Meteorology officials said on Tuesday they did not expect any more rain for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>State-run Bangladesh Television said on Tuesday night some three million people had been affected by the floods, triggered by heavy monsoon rains.</p>
<p>Disaster management officials earlier said at least 250,000 people had been left homeless and 500,000 marooned in their partly submerged homes.</p>
<p>Agriculture officials said 300,000 acres (120,000 hectares) of crops had been washed away. A large amount of stored grain was also damaged by floodwaters, they said, without giving exact estimates.</p>
<p>Thousands of hectares of shrimp farms and other aquaculture projects had been washed away, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still early to assess the losses. But we guess total flood damage including crops, property and infrastucture would be no less than 10 billion taka ($229 million),&quot; one official in Chittagong told Reuters.</p>
<p>Civil administration, army and air force officials have geared up to provide relief supplies to flood victims, who are facing an acute shortage of dry food, safe drinking water and medicine.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is most pressing in Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and the Chittagong Hill Tracts,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>Medical teams have been sent to flood-swept areas to try to battle diseases carried in polluted water and rotten food.</p>
<p>Health officials on Tuesday night said more than 1,000 people were suffering from diarrhoea and other stomach ailments in the flood-ravaged districts in the southeast.</p>
<p>&quot;No deaths have been reported yet but the diseases might take an epidemic turn in remote areas,&quot; one official in Chittagong said.</p>
<p>Some areas recovering from the floods faced new problems, including land and homes near river banks being eroded, officials said. Road links in Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Rangamati and Khagrachhari districts had been partially restored, officials in the Roads &amp; Highways department said.</p>
<p>Some areas remained impassable after floodwater washed away highway bridges and roads, they said.</p>
