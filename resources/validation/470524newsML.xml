<headline>Italy budget talks went &quot;well&quot; - hardleft leader.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-03-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>Talks about the forthcoming mini-budget with parties backing Italy's government went well, the leader of the hardleft Communist Refoundation said.</p>
<p>Fausto Bertinotti said the package, due to be approved by cabinet on Thursday, would not include cuts to welfare spending.</p>
<p>&quot;The talks went well. I say this because we are not ones to be triumphalist,&quot; Bertinotti said following a meeting with coalition party leaders and Prime Minister Romano Prodi.  </p>
<p>The mini-budget is expected to include up to 16 trillion lire of deficit cutting measures in a bid to prepare the economy for the launch of the single European currency.</p>
<p>Bertinotti had warned that he would not support any package which included a hike in taxes or cuts to the welfare state. He said coalition leaders had reached a &quot;compromise which will avoid cuts to social spending&quot;.</p>
<p>However the Refoundation leader indicated that after the mini-budget there might be an overhaul of the welfare state.</p>
<p>&quot;This opens a chapter which will be decisive - the reform of the welfare state. It is a chapter that is wide open,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Much of the cash from the corrective budget is expected to come from advance taxation on firms' severance payment funds. -- Rome newsroom +396 6782505</p>
