<p>Jennifer Capriati, playing her first match since leaving the Australian Open in tears last month, had a happier time at the IGA Tennis Classic on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The fifth-seeded Capriati shook off a slow start to beat Maria Alejandra Vento of Venezuela 6-3 6-4 in the first round.</p>
<p>Third seed Kimberly Po, who was just named to the U.S. Fed Cup team, and seventh seed Marianne Werdel Witmeyer also reached the second round.</p>
<p>The 19th-ranked Po held off compatriot Tami Whitlinger Jones 7-6 6-4, while Witmeyer caught a break when Nana Miyagi of Japan was forced to retire while on the verge of winning.</p>
<p>Miyagi won the first set 6-4 and was leading 5-3 in the second when she had to quit with a lower back sprain.</p>
<p>There was one minor upset when eighth-seeded Canadian Patricia Hy-Boulais fell to semi-retired veteran Pam Shriver 7-5 6-7 6-3.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old Capriati, in the second year of her comeback after her highly-publicised bouts with legal and personal problems, quickly fell behind 0-3 to Vento.</p>
<p>The former teen phenom then went on a tear, winning 11 of the next 12 games to take the first set 6-3 and a commanding 5-1 lead in the second.</p>
<p>&quot;I kicked it in and played my game. I am happy with the way I am playing,&quot; said Capriati, who reached the final of the Sydney International only to suffer a devastating first-round loss at the year's first Grand Slam tournament days later.</p>
<p>Capriati shrugged off her shaky start against Vento.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I was a little nervous, had a little jitters,&quot; she explained. &quot;This is the first time I have been seeded in awhile.</p>
<p>&quot;I enjoy giving a good performance and I think the crowd just wants to see me do well.&quot;</p>
