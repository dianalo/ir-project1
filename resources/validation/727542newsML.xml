<headline>S.Korean won ends down, central bank sells dollars.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1997-07-14</dateline>

<p>The won closed weakens on Monday on stop-loss dollar buying, but its fall was limited by the central bank's repeated dollar sales, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the local currency was expected to gain momentum on month-end dollar supply from exporters and a rising dollar inflow for equity investment.</p>
<p>The won closed at 981.40, down from the previous closing at 890.40 on Friday.</p>
<p>The Bank of Korea was seen selling dollars at around 892 won in mid-afternoon and again at around 891.20 won later.</p>
<p>Bank of Korea officials were unavailable for comment.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the intervention appeared aimed at keeping the won from falling sharply in the aftermath of the recent plunges of Thai and Philippine currencies vis-a-vis the U.S. unit.</p>
<p>&quot;Traders were growing nervous following the news on the baht and peso, and sentiment for the dollar was gaining strength here,&quot; said a foreign bank dealer. &quot;The central bank's intervention was necessary to ease such anxiety.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers forecast the won's base mid-rate was likely to be pegged at 891.40 won on Tuesday, against 890.00 won on Monday.</p>
