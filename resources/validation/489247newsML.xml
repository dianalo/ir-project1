<p>Ensconsed in a luxury villa behind pink walls, Haiti's former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide still wears the mantle of champion of the poor as he snipes at the government of his successor and one-time ally.</p>
<p>In senate and local council elections on Sunday, his Famni Lavalas (Lavalas Family) party is fielding slates of candidates against his old party the Lavalas Political Organisation (OPL).</p>
<p>The split has confused the Haitian political scene as President Rene Preval's OPL government goes through a precarious period in its struggle to overcome the legacy of decades of rule by dictators.</p>
<p>And while Aristide remains very popular, he is himself accused of the type of self-enrichment that past leaders indulged in.</p>
<p>The former Roman Catholic priest, elected in 1990 in a tidal wave of support by Haiti's poor and oppressed then ousted by a military coup in 1991, now lives in a large villa in Tabarre in the countryside outside the decrepit capital Port-au-Prince.</p>
<p>Razor wire is strung along its pink walls and a glimpse through the solid steel gates show a neatly trimmed lawn watered with sprinklers. A drive lined by lamp posts leads to a substantial house and swimming pool.</p>
<p>The road it stands off is named Boulevard 15 October after the date in 1994 that Aristide returned from exile following a U.S.-led military intervention. Smart and newly repaired with a drainage ditch and lacking potholes, it is a rarity in broken-down Haiti.</p>
<p>Sen. Jean-Robert Sabalat has accused Aristide of diverting funds donated by Taiwan for another road to rebuild this one.</p>
<p>How the villa was funded is a question many Haitians are asking but so far Aristide has declined to answer. He has only said that he plans to use the house for civic purposes, perhaps for a school.</p>
<p>He has also denied the common perception that he has become one of the richest men in Haiti.</p>
<p>&quot;Aristide has become a 'Gran Manje',&quot; said one disillusioned former supporter, using the Creole slang for corrupt government officials, meaning &quot;Big Eater&quot;.</p>
<p>Sen. Yvon Neptune of the Famni Lavalas said Aristide's wealth came from financial support from Haitians and foreign sources. He still dedicated time and resources to helping the poor, Neptune said.</p>
<p>&quot;He is not removed from the poor people. If someone is caring for the poor must he live in a shack? To help the poor you must have money,&quot; Neptune told Reuters at the Famni Lavalas headquarters.</p>
<p>&quot;He lives there, he receives people there -- heads of state and the poor. He eats with them, swims with them. There is no contradiction.&quot;</p>
<p>Unable under the law to run for a second consecutive term as president in elections in December 1995, Aristide endorsed his friend and ally Preval as his successor. He set up Famni Lavalas in November, initially denying it was a political party. But it was registered in January and is fielding candidates in Sunday's poll.</p>
<p>Famni has criticised Preval's economic reform programme which, guided by international monetary institutions and foreign donors, calls for privatisation of barely functioning state companies.</p>
<p>After Prime Minister Rosny Smarth survived a no-confidence motion in parliament last week, Aristide told reporters: &quot;I'm listening, I'm watching ... it's up to the people to decide.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if the parliament did not represent the people, he said: &quot;No, that's the government. The people will decide.&quot;</p>
<p>Neptune said Famni Lavalas stood for the orginal Lavalas' ideals and carried the banner of the party of the poor.</p>
<p>Aristide, who was always viewed with some suspicion in Washington for his populism, is widely believed to want to run for president again when Preval's term expires in the year 2000.</p>
