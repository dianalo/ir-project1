<headline>Arizona newspaper apologizes for bombing cartoon.</headline>
<dateline>PHOENIX 1997-06-21</dateline>

<p>An Arizona newspaper Saturday apologised for an editorial cartoon that used the painful image of a firefighter carrying a dead girl from the Oklahoma City bombing to argue against capital punishment.</p>
<p>In an open letter to readers, The Arizona Republic's top editor said she was sorry there was not &quot;more discussion&quot; before the cartoon was published.</p>
<p>The cartoon by Steve Benson showed a firefighter labeled &quot;death penalty fanatics&quot; holding the child as in the Pulitzer-prize winning photograph. In this case, the infant was pleading &quot;Please, no more killing,&quot; and the firefighter replied with &quot;Oh, stop your whining!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The images and the words created unintentional distress,&quot; wrote Pam Johnson, the newspaper's executive editor. &quot;And for that, The Republic apologises.&quot;</p>
<p>The photograph that inspired the cartoon showed Baylee Almon's broken body cradled in the arms of fireman Chris Fields and it quickly came to symbolise the bombing tragedy at the Alfred P. Murrah federal building that killed 168 people.</p>
<p>Johnson explained that editors occasionally need to refrain from publishing cartoons as the newspaper has done with Benson over the years.</p>
<p>The June 11 cartoon sparked outrage across the country and widespread calls for an apology from Benson.</p>
<p>Leading the way was the mother of Baylee Almon. Aren Almon Kok called the cartoon &quot;distasteful&quot; and said that it had ripped open the wounds from the tragedy.</p>
<p>The cartoon also was lambasted by the International Fire Fighters Association and Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating.</p>
<p>But Benson, a 1993 Pulitzer-prize winner, told Reuters earlier this week that he had no intention of apologising and that his cartoon was being misinterpreted.</p>
<p>The newspaper's editorial page editor also said earlier this week he had no regrets about publishing the editorial cartoon.</p>
<p>&quot;Steve's done things over the years that I've had second thoughts about, but this one did what it intended to do,&quot; said Paul Schatt, a veteran editor. &quot;It really hit you in the gut with his position on the death penalty.&quot;</p>
