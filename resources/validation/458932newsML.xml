<p>A heroine's welcome for a freed Palestinian guerrilla has sparked a diplomatic row between Brazil and Israel, with Israeli diplomats vowing on Friday not to let &quot;a terrorist&quot; ruin bilateral ties.</p>
<p>&quot;The embassy cannot allow a terrorist to damage the relationship between Israel and Brazil,&quot; an Israeli spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Israeli Embassy in Brasilia issued late on Thursday a harshly worded protest over a series of meetings high-ranking Brazilian officials have held with Lamia Maarouf, 32, since she was freed from an Israeli jail last month.</p>
<p>Maarouf, a Brazilian-born member of the Palestinian al-Fatah movement, served 11 years of a life sentence in Israel for taking part in the murder of an Israeli army sergeant, an event she still calls an &quot;act of war.&quot;</p>
<p>Sgt. David Manous, 20, was hitchhiking when he was picked up by Maarouf and her husband, Taufic Ibrahim, and killed in 1984. Ibrahim is still serving time in Israel but Maarouf was one of 30 Palestinian women whose release was agreed by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) last year.</p>
<p>Brazilian Foreign Ministry officials declined to comment on the row with Israel but acknowledged Maarouf had met Ivan Cannabrava, the general-subsecretary for political affairs. A ministry spokeswoman said Cannabrava was a former Brazilian ambassador to Israel and very familiar with the Maarouf case.</p>
<p>The Israeli Embassy spokesman said the Foreign Ministry had summoned Brazil's ambassador in Israel for a formal protest.</p>
<p>The freed Palestinian guerrilla was greeted by hundreds of well-wishers on her return to Brazil last month and the Brazilian media has feted her like a movie star. In the past week, she has met the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Michel Temer, the president of the Senate, Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, and other prominent officials in Brasilia.</p>
<p>Newspapers reported on Friday she had hoped to meet Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia but their talks were cancelled because the minister took ill. The reports could not immediately be confirmed.</p>
<p>In its statement, the Israeli embassy said the treatment of Maarouf by Brazilian officialdom was &quot;incomprehensible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It had been hoped that the supporters of peace, among them the official representatives of a peaceful country like Brazil, would avoid meeting people who symbolise terrorism and violence,&quot; it said.</p>
