<p>Australia's new-found leg-spin Twins, Shane Warne and Michael Bevan, took 16 wickets between them to hand their side a series-deciding victory in the fourth test against West Indies at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Australia won by an innings and 183 runs on the fourth day of the test against a hapless West Indies side to take an unbeatable 3-1 lead in the best-of-five match series and retain the Frank Worrell trophy they won in the Caribbean in 1995.</p>
<p>Bevan, originally picked three years ago as a batsman, capped his transformation this season into a dangerous left-arm leg-spinner with 10 wickets in the match.</p>
<p>He took six for 82 in the West Indies' second innings, fooling the tourists' top order time and again with his pace and variety.</p>
<p>Bevan, who also scored an unusually circumspect 85 not out, was named man of the match.</p>
<p>Warne, Australia's established leg-spinning wizard, showed he was still amoung the best in the world by taking three for 68 in the second innings and six wickets for the match.</p>
<p>West Indies lost the match within the first hour of the fourth day, but their fate had been effectively sealed when they self-destructed to be all out for 130 in their first innings on the first day on what was generally regarded as a good batting wicket.</p>
<p>Australia proved how good the wicket was in their first innings, scoring 517 in under two days.</p>
<p>West Indies, led by a defiant Brian Lara with 78, performed a little better in their second innings but were still unable to resist the guiles of Bevan and Warne to be all out for 204.</p>
<p>Australia's victory came near the end of a topsy-turvy summer which saw them begin the series with two crushing wins in November and December before slumping to a run of losses in limited overs matches and a capitulation inside three days in the third test in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Australia then missed out on a place in the finals of their annual World Series tri-nation limited overs competition for the first time since the 1979/80 series.</p>
<p>Australia and West Indies now travel to Perth for the fifth test starting on Saturday.</p>
