<p>An Iraqi Kurd leader said on Saturday both Iraqi troops and Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) forces were attacking the city of Arbil in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;Hundreds of Iraqi tanks and hundreds of Iraqi armoured cars are attacking the town and there are huge artillery bombardments,&quot; Jalal Talabani, head of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), told Radio France Internationale.</p>
<p>&quot;The KDP is co-operating with the Iraqi government and attacking the city side-by-side with Iraqi soldiers,&quot; Talabani said in the interview from his base near Suleymanli, a text of which was made available to Reuters before its broadcast.</p>
<p>Talabani, whose movement has since December 1994 held the disputed Arbil, seat of the autonomous Iraqi Kurdish parliament, said the attack began at 5 a.m. local time and the Iraqi troops had managed to enter the city in one location.</p>
<p>&quot;There is heavy fighting so there are a number of casualties among civilians,&quot; he said, adding that the Iraqi troops were trying to encircle the city and cut all lines between it and other &quot;liberated&quot; areas of Kurdistan.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect that the Iraqis after finishing with Arbil will attack other places in Kurdistan. They want to reoccupy Iraqi Kurdistan regardless of the (United States) Provide Comfort operation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The attack was one of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's &quot;biggest foolish acts&quot; and Baghdad was not expecting any response from Washington or its allies, he said.</p>
<p>But Talabani said that he was in continuous contact with the Pentagon and the State Department in Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;Our representatives are talking to them. We are promised there will be a response very soon,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Iraqi's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said earlier on Saturday that Iraqi troops were fighting to aid Kurdish rebel leader Massoud Barzani against &quot;the vicious aggression...from Jalal Talabani&quot;.</p>
<p>The rival Iraqi Kurds have presided uneasily over northern Iraq -- protected from Baghdad by U.S.-led allied air power -- since the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
