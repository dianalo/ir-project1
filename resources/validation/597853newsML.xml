<p>Most citizens of Hong Kong have few misgivings about the economy under future Chinese rule and plan to keep their assets in the territory, according to an influential bank survey out on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Credit Lyonnais report came 24 hours after a Reuters survey said Hong Kong's top companies were overwhelmingly positive about the business outlook after China takes control from the British colonial administration.</p>
<p>But a third poll on Monday said Hong Kong's prospective leader Tung Chee-hwa, anointed by Beijing, has suffered a setback in public confidence over his plan to curb civil liberties.</p>
<p>The Credit Lyonnais survey said his government, taking over after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control on July 1, was not expected to be more fair, open or effective against corruption than the current British administration.</p>
<p>But most of those surveyed said they were confident the incoming administration would handle the economy well and had increased their asset holdings in Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;People in their minds seem to be splitting off performance of the economy and the government,&quot; said Alex de Campi, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia and the author of the investment house's handover confidence survey, conducted jointly with the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;The main conclusion of the survey is that personal money in Hong Kong in Hong Kong dollar assets has come back in over the previous year, is still coming in and is staying in,&quot; she told a news conference.</p>
<p>Tung, a former shipping tycoon, takes over as Hong Kong's chief executive on July 1 when the territory becomes a Special Administrative Region of China after more than 150 years as a British colony.</p>
<p>Credit Lyonnais said confidence in the economy has grown because citizens are becoming more familiar with post-handover institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;The report itself is called 'Familiarity breeds content' -- it is merely that,&quot; said de Campi.</p>
<p>She said an improvement in the economy compared to early 1996 had also helped. &quot;Naturally as the economy picks up, people's confidence will pick up as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Of 1,109 Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong residents polled in early May by the Chinese University, 60 percent said they had 90 to 100 percent of their total assets in Hong Kong dollars, up from 52 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Over the next two years, 34 percent said they would increase their holdings of Hong Kong dollar-denominated assets, slightly up on the previous year, and 11 percent said they would decrease them, down from 34 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;If people were worried about the handover, if they were worried about the economy, they would not be repatriating their money,&quot; said de Campi.</p>
<p>But 53 percent said the SAR government would be less fair than the British and 55 percent said it would do a worse job in handling corruption. The percentages were down, however, from the same survey conducted in 1996.</p>
<p>Amid concern about plans by Tung to curb freedoms, a survey by the South China Morning Post newspaper and published on Monday also found that residents were placing less trust in the future leader.</p>
<p>However, the Credit Lyonnais survey showed an increase in confidence in the future government's ability to handle the economy, with 80 percent thinking it would do an equal or better job, compared with 68 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't have to be fair or open...to understand the economy,&quot; explained de Campi.</p>
