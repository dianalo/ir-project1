<p>Two Russian cosmonauts left the stricken Mir space station on Thursday and entered a Soyuz spacecraft to return to Earth after one of the toughest assignments in the history of manned space flight.</p>
<p>Outgoing commander Vasily Tsibliyev and flight engineeer Alexander Lazutkin embraced their two Russian replacements and NASA astronaut Michael Foale and waved for the cameras as they floated into the airlock between Mir and Soyuz.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that everything bad that we've had will leave with us,&quot; Tsibliyev said in a live broadcast from Mir shown on television screens at Mission Control outside Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;We are leaving. See you on Earth.&quot;</p>
<p>A Mission Control operator told Tsibliyev and Lazutkin: &quot;Thank you for the job you've done. Happy landing.&quot;</p>
<p>The operator said they had closed the hatches at 9.47 a.m. Moscow time (0547 GMT) and begun checking they were airtight.</p>
<p>Tsibliyev and Lazutkin were due to don spacesuits at 0643 GMT, undock at 0853 GMT and touch down at 1216 GMT in the ex-Soviet republic of Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Along with Foale, who will stay aboard Mir until September, they have endured a series of major woes since they came aboard Mir in February. The most serious was a June 25 collision between the station and its supply ship.</p>
<p>Mir has run on partial power since then.</p>
<p>Despite the warm words from Mission Control on Thursday, Tsibliyev and Lazutkin face an uncertain reception on Earth. President Boris Yeltsin said last week human error may have been to blame for the June 25 crash, which threatened Mir's future.</p>
<p>It will also be hard for them not to be haunted by the past as they hurtle to Earth.</p>
<p>In 1971 the capsule carrying the three pioneers on Moscow's first space station Salyut touched down after a successful mission hailed throughout the then Soviet Union.</p>
<p>But when excited ground staff opened the hatch they found that all three men had died on the way down, killed by a sudden drop in pressure during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p>Sixteen years later two cosmonauts undocked from the Mir space station which had replaced Salyut expecting a trouble-free return to Earth.</p>
<p>They did land safely, but only after a nightmarish two days in what the Izvestia newspaper called &quot;a lone boat drifting on a boundless ocean&quot; after failing to align properly for re-entry.</p>
<p>But such incidents are the exception amid the many Soviet and then Russian space missions which followed Yuri Gagarin's pioneering flight into space in 1965.</p>
<p>Like the weary Mir crew, one of whom pulled out a plug on a computer by mistake while battling with the power problems, space officials have learnt from their mistakes. Special light spacesuits were introduced after the 1971 tragedy and they do not expect any big problems with Thursday's landing.</p>
<p>A fleet of helicopters will be on hand to track the capsule after a huge parachute opens to slow its fall once it enters Earth's atmosphere. Rescue officials and mission control outside Moscow will also have radio contact with the craft.</p>
<p>After the June crash, Tsibliyev began suffering heart irregularities which doctors said were stress-related. But a top medical adviser said he would need no special medicine for his Thursday return.</p>
<p>Tsibliyev and Lazutkin also had to contend with a fire and a series of problems with their life support systems during their mission.</p>
<p>Their replacement Russian cosmonauts, commander Anatoly Solovyov and engineer Pavel Vinogradov, will have to try and restart the main oxygen supply system together with Foale.</p>
<p>On August 20, the two Russians are due to enter the airless Spektr module, punctured in the crash, to try to reconnect cables leading to the station's solar panels.</p>
