<title>USA: IMM currencies end mixed ahead of Tankan, holiday.</title>
<headline>IMM currencies end mixed ahead of Tankan, holiday.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-11-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>IMM currency futures finished mixed in a recovery from early losses as the focus turned to the upcoming Tankan report and the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p>Japan's report of business sentiment will be released on Wednesday before the U.S. markets open. Traders said December yen and dollar/yen were rangebound on Tuesday ahead of that report.</p>
<p>&quot;That's as to be expected in front of this holiday,&quot; one IMM trader said. &quot;But a lot of traders won't be manning desks tomorrow at all and I think that this could really make for some volatility for this Tankan report,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>IMM currencies will close early on Wednesday and Friday at 1200 CST/1800 GMT and will not trade on Thursday in observance of that U.S. holiday.</p>
<p>Traders said the combination of the holiday and the Tankan could keep action choppy and possibly volatile into next week.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm really expecting dollar/yen to spike higher, like to 114.75,&quot; the currency trader said. He said the general trend of the dollar was upward, and said unless the Tankan shows a huge change for the better in Japan's economy, the dollar uptrend will continue. December yen support was seen at $0.008875 and $0.008806, the contract low settlement.  </p>
<p>In Tuesday's action, the dollar came off its highs near midday and retreated to more familiar ground after rallies in dollar/mark and dollar/Swiss Monday and early Tuesday. Traders said players were likely positioning ahead of the holiday.</p>
<p>December marks and Swiss francs closed up from their earlier lows but still lower, lagging from early evidence that the Swiss banking sector was being hurt by a weak economy there.</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's announced on Tuesday it had placed triple-A long-term rated Union Bank of Switzerland on credit watch.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P said its &quot;CreditWatch&quot; action follows UBS' announcement that it will record a SFr 0.5 billion loss in 1996.</p>
<p>Traders tied some currency strength to a midday sell-off in U.S. stocks. They said the stock reversal put a crimp on the dollar's bullishness and could continue to stem dollar gains if stocks see an extended correction.</p>
<p>December yen settled up $0.000007 at $0.008906, marks slipped $0.0008 to $0.6566, Swiss francs were $0.0016 lower at $0.7762, sterling rose $0.0026 to $1.6706, Canadian dollars were up $0.0001 at $0.7462, Australian dollars were down $0.0003 at $0.8099 and Mexican pesos were up $0.000450 at $0.125400. -Derivatives desk 312-408-8750;E-mail derivatives@reuters.com</p>
