<title>GERMANY: Kohl urges SPD to resume tax reform talks.</title>
<headline>Kohl urges SPD to resume tax reform talks.</headline>
<dateline>MUNICH, Germany 1997-03-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Wednesday urged opposition Social Democrats (SPD) to return to the bargaining table for talks on tax reform.</p>
<p>The SPD boycotted a round of talks slated for last Saturday in protest against the government's plan to slash subsidies to coal miners.</p>
<p>Kohl told a trades' conference, &quot;We all stand in a common accountability.&quot; The SPD should resume the tax reform talks without regard for tactical political considerations, he said.</p>
<p>Both sides agree the comprehensive tax reform planned by Finance Minister Theo Waigel is badly needed to promote investment and boost jobs.</p>
<p>The plan includes a net 30 billion marks in tax cuts and would greatly simplify the system.</p>
<p>The SPD has urged the government to accelerate the package from its planned 1999 start. But opposition leaders have been busy this week addressing coal miners' rallies that have paralysed Bonn.</p>
<p>SPD party manager Franz Muentefering said his party was prepared to resume the tax talks, in the interests of fighting unemployment, even if Kohl's negotiations with coal miners on Thursday produce no agreement.</p>
<p>But Muentefering repeated his party's opposition to an increase in value-added tax to finance a cut in the top tax rate. The SPD also remains opposed to taxes on income from night- and holiday shifts.</p>
<p>Kohl said he was open to suggestions on moving up large parts of the package to 1998. But the overall concept must be retained, and the financial basis of the package must be secure.</p>
