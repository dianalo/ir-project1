<headline>Czech stats bureau revises 1996 GDP forecast.</headline>

<text>
<p>The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Friday revised its 1996 real gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast downward to 4.8 percent from its 5.1 percent year-on-year prognosis made at the beginning of August.</p>
<p>In a report, the CSU said it expected full year 1997 real GDP growth at between 5.1 to 5.6 percent.  </p>
<p>The CSU also revised its forecast for the full-year 1996 current account deficit to 6.9 percent of GDP from 5.7 percent as ballooning merchandise trade deficit continues to bite, and said the current account deficit would grow to between 6.8 to 7.4 percent of GDP in 1997.</p>
<p>The bureau slightly eased its forecast for full-year 1996 inflation to 8.9 percent from 9.0 percent in August, and said consumer prices would slow to between 7.5 percent to 8.0 percent for the whole of next year.</p>
<p>It said unemployment would remain at one of the lowest levels in Europe, but said it would edge up slightly to between 3.3 to 3.5 percent by the end of 1997 from 3.3 percent at the end of this year.  </p>
<p>The bureau said the merchandise trade deficit would grow to 163.3 billion crowns by end 1996 from the rough 111 billion crown deficit posted for the first three quarters this year and compared with roughly 96 billion crowns for the whole of 1995.</p>
<p>But the bureau said export growth should accelerate in 1997 to between 10.0 to 11.4 percent from 6.2 percent this year, while import growth would be between 14 to 16.2 percent next year from 15.4 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>It forecast the full-year merchandise trade deficit at 200 to 210 billion crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;It is realistic to forecast, in view of the massive investment into the (Czech) economy in the past several years and expected growth of (EU) economies... that the development of the of the (current account deficit) at the turn of 1997-98 which switch toward (the deficit's) reduction,&quot; the CSU said.  </p>
<p>The bureau blamed mainly a stagnation in the first three quarters in the German economy -- which accounts for just over a third of Czech export demand -- and in the whole EU for the revised trade figures and the revised GDP projection as well.</p>
<p>It said the slowdown of inflation -- to an average of 7.5 to 8.0 percent by the end of next year from 8.9 percent at the end of 1996 -- would be helped by a slowing in real wage growth to between 8.1 to 8.5 percent next year from 9.1 percent in 1996.</p>
