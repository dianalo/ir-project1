<p>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said on Wednesday it will operate eight percent more flights during the 1997 summer season than in the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;For the period, which begins March 30 and continues through October 25, KLM will operate a total of 44,000 flights,&quot; KLM said in a statement.</p>
<p>The number of available seats during the period would also rise by eight percent to 11.3 million, the airline said.</p>
<p>KLM plans to add Abidjan, Ivory Coast, to its schedule with flights twice a week in combination with Freetown, Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>The Dutch carrier is dropping flights to Colombo, Sri Lanka, Conakry in Guinea and Khartoum in Sudan, describing these as &quot;less profitable destinations&quot;.</p>
<p>It is also adding, through partner Northwest Airlines, daily connections from Amsterdam to Newark, New Jersey.</p>
<p>KLM has agreed a commercial partnership, including code sharing, with state-owned Sun Air of South Africa, it said.</p>
<p>The code share agreement involves flights to and from Durban and Cape Town which closely connect with KLM's flights between Amsterdam and Johannesburg, it added.</p>
<p>A cooperation with Kenya Airways, begun in November last year, on the route between Amsterdam and Nairobi will now be extended further, KLM said.</p>
