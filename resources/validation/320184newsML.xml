<title>CHINA: China to introduce state debt market maker system.</title>

<p>China's Finance Ministry will introduce a market maker system to the state debt secondary market in 1997, the Shanghai Securities News said on Monday.</p>
<p>The ministry will also introduce off-floor trading to add liquidity to state debt, expand market capacity and make trading more convenient for major traders, the paper quoted Gao Jian, director of the ministry's state debt department as saying.</p>
<p>The market makers will be major brokerages or securities houses who will be required to invest consistently in the state debt market and help stabilise prices when they fluctuate sharply.</p>
<p>&quot;A market maker system and off-floor trading will be introduced in 1997,&quot; Gao told a meeting of state debt underwriters in Shanghai on Sunday.</p>
<p>Gao said 1997 would also witness other reforms in China's state debt markets.</p>
<p>In contrast to the current practice of launching state debt issues without prior announcement, the Finance Ministry will this year release a fixed timetable for state debt offers, he said.  </p>
<p>The ministry will also issue more treasury notes and bonds which pay interest on an annual basis instead of on maturity to pave the way for the possible opening of trading in derivatives.</p>
<p>In 1996, China issued two batches of state debt paying annual interest as an experiment.</p>
<p>China will also expand the state debt wholesale market to reduce the cost of issues in 1997 and develop a national state debt clearing system, Gao was quoted by the newspaper as saying.</p>
<p>The newspaper gave no further details.</p>
<p>China issued a record of 195.2 billion yuan state debt in 1996 and implemented large-scale reforms including the introduction of a public tender system to set more market-sensitive coupons.</p>
<p>Industry sources expect China to issue a record of around 250 billion yuan in state debt in 1997.</p>
