<p>Japanese stocks were little changed from their closing levels in Tokyo in quiet trading in London, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a typical Friday. We're seeing a bit of profit-taking in stocks that have done well and a bit of buying in the ones that have done poorly,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Shares in Fuji Photo Film Co Ltd were among the most actively traded, slipping a tad on profit-taking, dealers said.</p>
<p>At 1416 GMT, the Nikkei 50 index was up 11.66 points from Thursday's London settlement to 1,442.45.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index added 361.23 points, or two percent, to finish at 17,846.98.</p>
<p>Banks, which have been under heavy selling pressure in recent months, were among the best performers in Tokyo, but dealers said the sector was narrowly mixed in London.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think this is a turnaround in their fortunes yet,&quot; the dealer said of the recent bounce in the bank sector. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 5106</p>
