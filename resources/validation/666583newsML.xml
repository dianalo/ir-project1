<p>Venezuelan commercial bank lending rose 9.7 percent in May to 3.9 trillion bolivars ($8.1 billion) over April, continuing a galloping increase, Softline consultants reported.</p>
<p>The rise is another indicator of a Venezuelan economic recovery and follows recent data on increased imports, vehicle sales and electricity consumption.</p>
<p>According to the firm's monthly round-up of 40 commercial banks, total deposits rose at the slower rate of 2.6 percent to 5.7 trillion bolivars ($11.8 billion).  </p>
<p>Banco Provincial topped the list of deposit holders, with 1.3 trillion bolivars, followed by Banco Mercantil with 732 billion bolivars, and Banco de Venezuela with 545 billion bolivars.</p>
<p>These three banks -- which together account for nearly 45 percent of total deposits -- also increased loans by the greatest amounts, with Provincial up 9.8 percent to 638 billion bolivars,  Mercantil up 9.5 percent to 609 billion and Banco de Venezuela up a huge 12.4 percent to 254 billion.  </p>
<p>The generally quicker rise in loans pushed up the banking sector's intermediation index -- which describes the amount banks lend per each bolivar deposited -- to 50.3 percent from 47.05 percent in April.</p>
<p>In a further sign of a shift of bank portfolios into loans, total investment in securities fell one percent to 2.5 trillion bolivars. Over the past two years of recession and restrained borrowing, such investments have served as a refuge for Venezuela's liquidity-rich banks.  </p>
<p>As a percentage of bank assets, loans now account for 41.2 percent, up nearly two points from April, while investments in securities continued to drop, falling one point to 33.9 percent, Softline said.</p>
<p>Softline added that bank capitalization rates, or the ratio of shareholders equity to total assets, was broadly flat at 13.66, compared to 13.64 percent in April.</p>
<p>Loan demand is expected to increase as economic recovery sets in, with the government forecasting upwards of four percent growth for this year. State-owned oil giant Petroleos de Venezuela's 10-year plan envisions annual investment of some $6 billion alone.</p>
