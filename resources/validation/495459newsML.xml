<p>Former Sumitomo Corp chairman Tomiichi Akiyama was sued for 200 billion yen by an individual shareholder over the company's huge losses on world copper markets, a lawyer for the shareholder said on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Sumitomo shareholder Kazuyoshi Yuoka on Tuesday filed a representative shareholder suit, said Tokuo Sakaguchi, one of his lawyers. Such suits seek compensation for the company as a whole rather than just the shareholder who files the suit.</p>
<p>The suit was in response to a huge copper trading loss by Sumitomo's former star trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, Sakaguchi said.</p>
<p>Sumitomo has said it lost $2.6 billion as a result of a decade of unauthorised trading by Hamanaka, who was fired in June 1996.  </p>
<p>Yuoka filed the suit against Akiyama because of what he believed were lax checks and controls over Hamanaka's copper trading, Sakaguchi said.</p>
<p>Akiyama was Sumitomo Corp's president when it announced its copper trading losses last June. He became chairman a few weeks later in a previously scheduled move, but resigned from his post this February and was made a special adviser to the company.</p>
<p>Sakaguchi said that Yuoka also filed suits against four other former Sumitomo executives for 100 million yen each. The four were Akio Imamura, who was Hamanaka's direct supervisor, Ryo Yamakawa, Imamura's former boss, Mutsumi Hashimoto, former executive vice president, and Iwao Nishiumi, former managing director.</p>
<p>Sumitomo said in a statement regarding Yuoka's suit: &quot;We're not aware of the content of the suit yet, but the company is not in a position to comment if the suit was filed against individual former executives.&quot;</p>
<p>Last September Yuoka filed a lawsuit seeking to nullify shareholder approval of a fund to cover the trade house's copper market losses.</p>
<p>The following November he issued a warning to Sumitomo stating his intention to sue for compensation in connection with the losses.</p>
