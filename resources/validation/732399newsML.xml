<headline>Dollar ends mixed after pullback from U.S. highs.</headline>

<p>*Dlr ends with modest gain near 1.79 marks after fails to top 1.80 on helpful Waigel comments. Waigel said dollar, stg, lifted by strong economies, not worried. Profits taken below 1.80. *Stops hit at 1.7960, current support at 1.7850 Asian low. *Big seller at 116.40 yen. Fear of Jpn trade data hampers dollar.</p>
<p>*Buba intervention seen unlikely here. Possible near 1.83.</p>
<p>The dollar climbed as German leaders played down the negative impact of its recent rally, but surrendered some gains on late profit-taking and fear of troubling trade data to be released in Japan overnight.</p>
<p>Germany's Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the dollar and British pound had risen against the German mark because of strong economies in the United States and Britain and that currency market fluctuations were no grounds for worry.</p>
<p>&quot;In essence, he was giving the green light to buy dollars,&quot; said John McCarthy, senior vice president at ING Barings.</p>
<p>The comments from Waigel and other German officials were far more optimistic than investors had expected and pushed the dollar higher.</p>
<p>German spokesman Peter Hausmann said the mark's weakness would stimulate German exports and job growth. A weaker mark lowers relative prices of products made in Germany, making them more competitive in international markets.</p>
<p>&quot;While they didn't condone the dollar's move higher, certainly the rhetoric the markets had expected from the Germans did not come out,&quot; said Stephen Flanagan, corporate foreign exchange vice president at Credit Agricole Indosuez.</p>
<p>But the dollar's rally stalled at 1.80 marks, a key psychological barrier where some dealers have speculated the Bundesbank might enter the market to sell dollars for marks.</p>
<p>The ensuing profit-taking ultimately triggered stop-loss offers near 1.7960 marks and pushed the dollar toward 1.79.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no follow-through buying, so people just dumped dollars. At 1.80 marks, that was seen as an unattractive level to own dollars,&quot; McCarthy said.</p>
<p>The dollar ended higher at 1.7910/20 marks versus 1.7885/95 at the open, but edged lower to 115.50/60 yen from 115.65/70 at the open and a session high at 116.40.</p>
<p>Investors also looked to lighten dollar holdings ahead of a report on Japan's customs-cleared trade data for June due for release Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Forecasts put Japan's trade gap at 1.1 trillion yen, a 49-percent increase from May. Such a number could trigger heavy yen buying for dollars, and investors sold dollars in anticipation, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;With the trade figures coming out, people were a bit fearful of owning dollars. We had a large seller come into the market and we made a quick move down,&quot; said Flanagan.</p>
<p>The German comments and the dollar's modest declines eased fears of official market intervention to halt its rally.</p>
<p>&quot;People are talking fundamentals, which will drive our markets,&quot; Flanagan said. &quot;Intervention would run against the grain of fundamentals and only make the market unstable, which is not what central banks want.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the dollar would continue to move higher in coming days despite short-term swings.</p>
<p>&quot;At some point I think the dollar goes higher, but that doesn't mean we can't see it go down in the meantime,&quot; said McCarthy.</p>
<p>Data released Wednesday on consumer prices and industrial production for June offered fresh evidence of steady, low-inflation growth in the United States.</p>
<p>The core consumer price index in the first half of 1997 rose 2.4 percent, a 32-year low, while manufacturing output rose 0.3 percent in June, faster than expected.</p>
<p>In other trade, the dollar was little changed at 1.4745/55 Swiss francs versus 1.4747/52 and ended higher at Canadian $1.3740/45 from C$1.3718/23. Sterling rose to $1.6782/92 from $1.6755/65. The Australian dollar rose to $0.7359/64 from $0.7355/60.     ((--Chris Stetkiewicz, 212-859-1664))</p>
