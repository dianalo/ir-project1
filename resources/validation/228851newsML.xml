<title>FRANCE: French capital markets closing report.</title>

<p>French bond futures overcame early jitters after a surprise fall in unemployment in November to set a new contract high, trimming benchmark 10-year government bond yields to their lowest level in more than two decades.</p>
<p>The yield on the 10-year benchmark government bond fell as low as 5.58 during the day and was at 5.60 percent late on Monday, below the recent low 5.61 percent of January 3, 1994.</p>
<p>Analysts said ongoing hopes for interest rate cuts in Europe, combined with the reaffirmation by French officials of the franc fort policy, contributed to the continuation of the positive bond market sentiment.  </p>
<p>A surprise 12,000 drop in the number of French jobseekers in November gave traders a pretext for taking some profits early in the session after the contract opened at a new high. The move also allowed a gap between 129.20-40 to be filled.</p>
<p>Analysts said the decline in unemployment, which left the jobless rate unchanged at 12.6, did not change the overall trend and that they would want to see more than just one month's improvement before reassessing the pessimistic outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;Numbers go up and numbers go down, I doubt it means France is out of the woods,&quot; Steven Englander, economist at Smith Barney in Paris, said.  </p>
<p>&quot;With all these numbers you need two months in the same direction before you can begin to suspect something underlying,&quot; Englander said.</p>
<p>The bond contract slipped again slightly after a stronger-than-expected U.S. purchasing managers survey but rallied into the close to settle at 129.42, up 0.26.</p>
<p>Traders said it was dangerous to go short at the moment and said people were already talking about objectives of 130 and the all-time high of 131.38.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's like a petrol tanker set on its course, not much can stop it,&quot; a futures trader in Paris, said.  </p>
<p>Some analysts said they thought the current wave of euphoria about the chances for interest rates cuts was somewhat overdone and that the short end of the curve was already looking expensive.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't believe that the Bank of France is going to wade in with rate cuts,&quot; Iain Lindsay, senior bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais, said. &quot;On Friday people were focusing on the fact the Bundesbank might be pushed into cutting rates but Tietmeyer poured cold water on that over the weekend.&quot;</p>
<p>Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer repeated that he saw no reason to alter German interest rates for now.  </p>
<p>&quot;Still, the Buba's capable of anything and maybe that's the logic that's keeping the market going,&quot; Lindsay said.</p>
<p>As expected the Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at Monday's money market tender.</p>
