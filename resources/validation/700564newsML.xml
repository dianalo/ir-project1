<p>Asian fund-raisers could become the key borrowers in the samurai market after the recent boom in dual-currency samurai issuing ended abruptly due to the dollar's fall against the yen, underwriting sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>With the issuance of dual samurais grinding to a halt in June, the samurai market was dominated by issuers from Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Indonesia during the month, with a South African bond also being issued.</p>
<p>&quot;There are geographical benefits for Asian borrowers to issue in Japan. Japan is also very familiar to them,&quot; said Masaru Hamazaki, deputy manager at Yamaichi Research Institute.</p>
<p>&quot;Without dual-currency bonds, the samurai market will likely be dominated by Asian borrowers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Record-low interest rates in Japan will also attract stronger interest by issuers.</p>
<p>The capacity in the samurai market is likely to shrink to where it was two years ago without the issuance of dual-currency samurais, while the market will lure fund raisers with borrowers carrying lower credit ratings, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The countries or firms with lower credit ratings like to raise funds in the samurai market as they can raise at a lower cost than in the euro market. That is the reason the Asians will be the key borrower in the samurai market,&quot; Hamazaki said.</p>
<p>Samurai bond issuing volume plunged to its lowest level in June since May 1995 and there was no issuance of dual-currency samurais during the month, the first time that has happened since August 1995.</p>
<p>Underwriters said overall samurai issues are expected to average about 100 billion yen per month, with eastern European and other emerging market likely to be the key fund-raisers along with the Asian borrowers.</p>
<p>Underwriters said that China, especially the banking affiliates of the central bank of China, and fund raisers from South Korea, could issue regularly in the future.</p>
<p>As long as the dollar does not make a dynamic recovery, the Asians are expected to lead the samurai market, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Underwriters are still looking for chances to offer the dual-currency bonds in the samurai market again,&quot; a senior underwriter said.</p>
<p>Dual-currency samurai bond volume soared in 1996, amounting to 2.4 trillion yen compared with the previous record of 600 billion yen in 1995.</p>
<p>During the past two years, many corporations made successful debuts in the samurai markets by issuing large volume of dual-currency samurai bonds for retail investors, with many of them issued by new faces from western firms.</p>
<p>U.S. names such as Walt Disney Co, McDonald's Corp, International Business Machines Corp, Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc and PepsiCo Inc were highly popular among investors.</p>
<p>&quot;We may see some dual-currency issuing again, but retail investors will be very cautious. The volume of dual-currency samurais in future is not likely to be large,&quot; a senior manager at a major Japanese brokerage said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless the dual samurai issuing boom revives again, we do not expect to see familiar U.S. or European names again,&quot; the senior manager said.</p>
