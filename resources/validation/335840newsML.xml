<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>

<p>Dutch shares shrugged off a weaker start to Wall Street on Monday to post solid gains on the back of option-related buying and bullish charts, dealers said.</p>
<p>The AEX index of blue-chip stocks closed 5.80 points higher at 682.48, not far from its intra-day high of 683.33 and the all-time peak of 686.01 points scored on January 23.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was still in good shape and although the possibility of a major shake-out remained, most thought fresh highs were likely to be tested first. Technical analysts said they also expected further gains, with an initial test at resistance at last week's all-time record.  </p>
<p>Most shares in the AEX index posted gains in a day, where option-related buying of share baskets featured strongly. Interest from the options market could also make the index vulnerable to a quick downside move, dealers added.</p>
<p>On individual stocks, flag carrier KLM had another good day, putting on 2.10 guilders to 55.90 as local private investors followed the institutional buying seen on Friday, when U.S. brokerage Merrill Lynch announced it had upgraded the stock to a near-, long-term buy from accumulate. Merrill gave no futher details but dealers noted the shares were still well below their year's peak of 64.30 guilders, reached at the end of May.  </p>
<p>Electronics giant Philips started the day under pressure, hit by a weekend Dutch newspaper report that it may post a 1996 loss through including the costs incurred by severing ties with its troubled loss-making German unit Grundig.</p>
<p>De Volkskrant said on Saturday the restructuring Philips had set aside under chairman Cor Boonstra was 700 million guilders short of covering the costs. The company declined comment.</p>
<p>The shares dipped to a low of 73.10 guilders but also amid talk of a U.S. buy recommendation, soon found ready buyers and ended the day 1.10 guilders higher at 74.70.  </p>
<p>But retail group Koninklijke Bijenkokrf Beheer (KBB) fared less well. It issued a profit warning after the market had closed on Friday and was marked lower from the outset.</p>
<p>KBB said its 1996/97 ordinary net would fall to between 55 and 60 million guilders from 98.6 million in the year before as its loss-making clothing chain M&amp;S Mode weighed on earnings.</p>
<p>The shares tumbled more than eight percent to close 10.30 guilders lower at 112.70.</p>
<p>Food group Nutricia ended 0.30 higher at 267.30, as the stock continued its recovery after plunging on Friday amid a salmonella scare in the UK over one of its babymilk powders.  </p>
<p>U.S. brokers J.P. Morgan downgraded the company to a market performer from buy, saying although the near-term impact on earnings would not be significant, some customer concerns could be carried over into some of its other lines in Europe.</p>
<p>But Dutch analysts said Nutricia had sufficient provisions to cover any problems and saw no reason to alter their buy recommendations on the stock.</p>
