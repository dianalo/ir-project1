<p>Japanese government bond (JGB) futures ended Tokyo trade firmer on Monday but found their topside limited. They fell back from a brief foray as high as 127.05 sales and sales subsequently lined up above 127.00, traders said.</p>
<p>But dips were expected to be similarly limited amid an absence of fresh selling factors and technical support near 126.90 seen holding steady.</p>
<p>The benchmark 10-year September JGB futures contract closed at 126.95, up from 126.83 at Friday's close, with turnover of 27,094 contracts. It ranged from 126.84 to 127.05.  </p>
<p>The market was watching moves in Tokyo stocks, which ended the day lower on negative influence from Friday's fall on Wall Street, but traders said the impact was limited.</p>
<p>Although the key Nikkei-225 index at one point fell as low as 18,835.48, it managed to hold above a low of 18,801.68 marked last Wednesday and finished at 19,041.10, still down by 284.93 from Friday.</p>
<p>But bond buying was inhibited by concerns about possible profit-taking sales to offset these losses ahead of half-year book-closings at the end of September, and so the weakness had little impact, traders said.  </p>
<p>One trader said, however, that if the Nikkei manages to stay at 18,000 or above by end-September, such profit-taking sales are likely to be limited.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now the market needs more signs of fundamental economic weakness to help push it higher; stocks alone won't do it,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>A lack of activity from investors, whose market participation still appears to be thinned by summer vacations, prevented follow-through buying after key September rose on early bids and was one of the reasons behind the market's generally lethargic moves, traders said.  </p>
<p>The yield on the benchmark 182nd 10-year cash bond stood at 2.085 percent at 0636 GMT against 2.090 percent at Friday's Tokyo close.</p>
<p>Traders said the topside was being weighted slightly by this week's expected issue of a number of corporate bonds, but that the impact would be more psychological than anything else as the volume is unlikely to be that large.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, the market will watch to see how these are absorbed. But it is unlikely to become a big concern,&quot; one trust bank trader said. --Elaine Lies +81-3-3432-8806</p>
