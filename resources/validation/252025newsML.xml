<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ detective jailed for faking satanic attack.</title>
<headline>NZ detective jailed for faking satanic attack.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-12-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>A New Zealand fraud squad detective was sentenced to five years' jail on Friday after admitting faking a Satanic attack on himself and burning down his own home to make a false insurance claim.</p>
<p>Brent Garner, 32, a former detective in the North Island town of Ashurst, was sentenced in the Palmerston North District Court. He had faced a possible term of up to 14 years.</p>
<p>The case was originally reported as a horrendous assault on Garner bearing hallmarks of a Satanic cult. Garner, who claimed a miraculous escape, helped police compile a photofit picture of the supposed assailant.</p>
<p>In fact it was Garner who, on October 18, spread petrol throughout his home and cut his back with a scalpel. He then set a timing device, threw petrol over himself, tied a gag over his mouth and tied himself up.</p>
<p>After the house was engulfed in fire, Garner was found nearby, still bound and gagged, with multiple injuries and claiming to have escaped his attackers.</p>
<p>After 37 days of police investigation, Garner admitted he had staged the whole affair. He planned to separate from his wife and said he wanted to give his family a good financial start.</p>
<p>Judge Lynton Lang told Garner that the forgeries were bizarre and cruel to other police.</p>
<p>He said he had bought significant discredit to police at a time when there was public sympathy for officers because of recent attacks on them.</p>
