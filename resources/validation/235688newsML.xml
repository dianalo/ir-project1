<title>JAPAN: Cash JGBs up, futures flat in uneventful Tokyo.</title>
<headline>Cash JGBs up, futures flat in uneventful Tokyo.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1996-12-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Cash Japanese government bonds (JGBs) were firmer while futures were flat in uneventful Tokyo trading on Wednesday in a market led by technical transactions by dealers.</p>
<p>The basis between the cash and futures bonds widened due to the futures market's reluctance to follow the cash JGB gains.</p>
<p>&quot;Somebody was trying to block selling in the futures, while bidding up cash (JGBs). This may have had something to do with the need to unwind the positions in both markets,&quot; said a brokerage trader. Otherwise, the market was quiet with the upside capped by investors' need to take profits.  </p>
<p>The yield of the benchmark 182nd 10-year JGB was at 2.355 percent at 0646 GMT, down from Tuesday's 2.375 percent. It moved in a range of 2.335-2.380 percent.</p>
<p>Option volatilities were down as the key March contract was stuck in a narrow trading range.</p>
<p>The March ended the session at 126.18, unchanged from Tuesday. It moved in 126.07-126.39 range with turnover of 42,146 contracts.</p>
<p>In early trade, there was wariness about the overnight tumble of Wall Street stocks and its possible impact on markets. But the fall had little visible impact in Tokyo.  </p>
<p>Dealers bought futures earlier in hopes that the Nikkei 225 average would fall sharply on Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>But the Nikkei, the Tokyo stock market benchmark, bounced back from its lows to close the session up 29.35 points at 20,659.91. &quot;Those who bought in the hope of seeing a sharper fall in the Nikkei had to liquidate longs, resulting in the March dipping into negative territory after earlier rises,&quot; said a trader at a trust bank's securities unit.</p>
<p>Investors, apart from showing profit-taking interest, were content to reshuffle part of their bond portfolios, which was neutral to the market.  </p>
<p>The market is waiting for the scheduled appearance of Eisuke Sakakibara, director-general of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau, on a local television programme on Thursday. Sakakibara will appear on TV Tokyo's &quot;World Business Satellite&quot; programme, which will run from 11-11.55 p.m. (1400-1455 GMT) on Thursday. No specific topic has been decided for the programme, a station spokesman said.</p>
<p>The market is cautious because Sakakibara said in early November that the Japanese market's view on the economy was too pessimistic. The remark depressed JGB prices.</p>
