<headline>De Beers says fair to consider no Russian gem deal.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-06-24</dateline>

<p>South African diamond giant De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd said on Tuesday it was &quot;fair&quot; to consider the possibility of no gem export deal with Russia, given Moscow's failure to approve a trade deal.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is fair to ask that question (of there being no gem trade deal), given the delays,&quot; said Raymond Clarke, the head of De Beers' representation in Moscow. &quot;My answer is that we will cooperate with Russia either informally or formally. Life won't come to an end (without a deal).&quot;  </p>
<p>De Beers sharply curtailed its purchases of Russian rough diamonds at the start of 1997 after Moscow failed to approve a draft trade agreement submitted to the cabinet in October 1996.</p>
<p>Russian officials, including First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, have repeatedly put off the date by which they expect to see an export deal signed. Chubais said at the end of last month the deal would be signed in the next few days.</p>
<p>Russia has also failed to sign a decree outlining diamond export quotas for most of 1997. Both snags have deeply frustrated De Beers and Almazy Rossii-Sakha, Russia's dominant diamond producer.</p>
<p>Russia allowed some limited gem exports up until the end of May, but a batch of diamonds, mostly owned by De Beers and exportable under a May quota, was held up. But Clarke said he would not link the holdup with the general delays to an overall trade deal.</p>
