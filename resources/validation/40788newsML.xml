<p>Peace talks on Northern Ireland hit a new stumbling block on Monday but their chairman, former U.S. senator George Mitchell, vowed to continue his efforts.</p>
<p>Hardline pro-British leader Ian Paisley demanded expulsion of two parties linked to so-called &quot;Loyalist&quot; guerrillas, throwing a new cloud over negotiations that Britain and Ireland say offer the region its best prospects of peace for decades.</p>
<p>A decision on the two parties, which, like Paisley, favour a continued British presence in Northern Ireland, was put on hold when Mitchell adjourned plenary negotiations until Tuesday.</p>
<p>Paisley is concerned their continued presence could pave the way for Sinn Fein, political wing of the IRA guerrilla group which resumed a fight against British rule in February after a 17 month truce, to take part in the talks.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein have been refused seats at the talks until the IRA renews its ceasefire.</p>
<p>In line with agreed procedures, Mitchell gave the parties and the British and Irish governments time to consider Paisley's complaint.</p>
<p>Heading into the opening session after a one-month summer recess, Mitchell dismissed rumours that he was considering resigning as chairman.</p>
<p>&quot;No, that is completely untrue,&quot; he told reporters when asked about reports that he would pull out of the talks unless progress is made on how to disarm Irish Catholic and pro-British Protestant guerrilla groups.</p>
<p>The talks have failed to tackle a single substantive issue since they began in June and have turned into a replay of the Protestant-Catholic rivalry at the root of the conflict.</p>
<p>Mitchell said he was happy to be back and stressed his commitment to the talks, aimed at ending communal distrust after a 25-year guerrilla war which killed more than 3,000 people.</p>
<p>&quot;When I accepted the invitation of the (British and Irish) to participate in these talks, I accepted enthusiastically because I believed the talks represent an historic opportunity for the people of Northen Ireland. That is still my view,&quot; Mitchell said in a statement.</p>
<p>Paisley handed Mitchell what the cleric-politician termed as &quot;an indictment&quot; of the smaller Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) and the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), the political wings of the banned Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Volunteer Force.</p>
<p>Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), was angry because the parties have failed to condemn a threat by pro-British guerrillas to kill convicted Protestant activist Billy Wright, who opposes their participation in the talks.</p>
<p>Wright says the talks could lead to an all-Ireland state against the wishes of the British region's Protestant majority.</p>
<p>&quot;We as a party are not prepared to continue at the table until this matter is resolved,&quot; Paisley told reporters.</p>
<p>PUP and UDP leaders brushed aside Paisley's protests and said they were committed to peace. &quot;There is nothing in it which we believe is an indictment,&quot; commented Billy Hutchinson, head of the PUP.</p>
