<p>Bad assets held by major Japanese general contractors are growing due to falling land prices, a private credit research company said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Teikoku Databank Ltd said in a survey that hidden losses on real estate holdings by the nation's 72 general contractors were estimated to have grown to 1.41 trillion yen (corrects from 1.41 billion yen) by the end of the 1995/96 fiscal year to March 31, up 648.9 billion yen or 85.1 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>In the year ended March 31, 1993 (corrects from 1992), the general contractors had unrealised profits of 1.84 trillion yen, Teikoku said.  </p>
<p>The survey was based on Teikoku Databank's estimate of market prices of real estate the companies currently hold and the book value of the assets.</p>
<p>&quot;General contractors are reluctant to sell land holdings to tidy up their books,&quot; a Teikoku Databank official said. &quot;They are worried that the Construction Ministry will not give orders for public works if they post losses,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>General contractors actively bought real estate in the &quot;bubble&quot; era of the late 1980s for development and investment. But the five-year-long land market slump has left them with huge unrealised losses.  </p>
<p>According to the survey, Fujita Corp had an estimated 296.49 billion yen in hidden losses on real estate holdings as of end-March, the largest among the 72 firms.</p>
<p>Taisei Corp had the second largest at 171.13 billion yen, Tokyu Construction Co Ltd had 162.5 billion yen, followed by Obayashi Corp with 151.77 billion yen and Haseko Corp with 131.01 billion yen.</p>
<p>Among the top five, Haseko posted a 102.7 billion yen parent current loss in 1995/96 by selling about half of its real estate holdings in order to improve its financial health.  </p>
<p>Among the 72 firms, only three are not listed.</p>
<p>&quot;If those general contractors tried to dispose of unrealised losses on real estate holdings, they would have to post losses as the current market prices are much lower than the book value,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>In addition, Japan's general contractors, as a whole, are estimated to have more than three trillion yen worth of liabilities as a result of guarantees they made on bank loans to developers, he said.</p>
