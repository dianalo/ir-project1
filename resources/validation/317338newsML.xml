<p>Albanian opposition parties vowed on Sunday to hold fresh protests against President Sali Berisha's conservative government but the interior ministry warned against what it termed illegal demonstrations.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall continue protests for democracy until this fully anti-democratic regime is overthrown,&quot; said Rexhep Mejdani, secretary-general of the main opposition Socialists.</p>
<p>About 3,000 demonstrators, led by opposition leaders including Mejdani, earlier pierced police cordons to reach Tirana's main Skanderbeg Square, scene of a 1990 uprising that toppled the communist regime.</p>
<p>&quot;The police are with us, the government is a thief,&quot; they chanted before police armed with batons moved in to disperse them.</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry quickly issued a strongly-worded statement warning demonstrators that it would bring the full weight of the law to bear on those involved in any future disturbances.</p>
<p>&quot;The Interior Ministry in cooperation with the prosecutor's office will deliver the deserved legal response to those responsible for violating the law...It will act with all the force the law entitles against anyone who does not respect it,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The ministry rejected eyewitness reports that some protesters in Tirana had been hurt in scuffles with police and it accused the opposition of encouraging people to daub themselves with red ink to fake injury.</p>
<p>Three opposition parties -- the Socialists, the centre-right Democratic Alliance and centre-left Social Democrats -- proposed Sunday's demonstration after a week of spontaneous protests against pyramid investment schemes.</p>
<p>Such schemes, promising untold wealth in return for small investments, boomed in the poor Balkan nation after the fall of communism in 1990 and have robbed thousands of Albanians of their life savings.</p>
<p>Berisha promised on Saturday to crack down on the operators of pyramid schemes.</p>
<p>In Fier, 110 km (70 miles) south of Tirana, the Socialists reported that 5,000 people took to the streets to demand the resignation of the local mayor, whom they claim was elected with the help of pyramid scheme funds.</p>
<p>By late afternoon Tirana's Skanderbeg Square had returned to normal and a mood of pessimism had begun to taken hold among some protesters.</p>
<p>&quot;The money with Sude has gone,&quot; said a middle-aged man in a Tirana bar. The Sude pyramid scheme, once one of the most popular, collapsed last week, leaving thousands out of pocket.</p>
