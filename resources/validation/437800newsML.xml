<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-AWB to inject A$100 mln into NSW Australia.</title>

<p>The Australian Wheat Board (AWB) will be injecting almost A$100 million into the economy of the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) next week, state manager Ted Laskie said in a statement.</p>
<p>This would be in addition to almost A$680 million already paid out to NSW growers in the wheat harvest payment, he said.</p>
<p>Latest payment would be about A$20 a tonne as part of 1996/97 AWB national pools post-harvest payment programme, he said.</p>
<p>Results of this year's bumper NSW wheat crop would flow through to the entire state economy, he said.</p>
<p>While prices fell away toward the end of last year, they had in recent months reversed that to stabilise close to their opening at A$200 a tonne, with the AWB national pool now at A$193 for Australian Standard White (ASW), he said.</p>
<p>The post-harvest payment would bring cumulative payments so far for the traditional pool to 90 percent of the current estimated silo return, less 90 percent of deductions for GrainCorp and Freight Corp charges, he said.</p>
<p>Growers delivering into the pools at harvest time receive 80 percent payment within 21 days of delivery, with the post-harvest payment topping up cumulative payments to 90 percent of current equity. The balance is paid out over the life of the pool and depends on cash flow and grain sales.</p>
<p>Post harvest payments are A$19.80 for Prime Hard 13 percent protein, A$16.50 for Australian Hard1 11.5 percent protein and A$16.80 for ASW 10 percent protein.</p>
