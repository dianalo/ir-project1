<p>London cocoa futures took a tumble on long liquidation but late bargain-hunting helped some contracts to finish off their lows, traders said.</p>
<p>Benchmark March contract sank to a low of 917 stg a tonne after breaching the previous support at 920 stg. But it came back to end the day at 920, still a 12 stg loss.</p>
<p>Traders could not pinpoint any fresh fundamental factors but some said overnight news by a UK crop forecaster who reiterated that the Ivorian 1996/97 crop could be at least one million tonnes could have driven the market lower.</p>
<p>The projection came a day after an Ivorian diplomat estimated the total crop at 850,000 to 900,00 tonnes including the mid crop because the weather has not been kind this year.</p>
<p>&quot;It came off a bit on the Robert Fish comments but overall the market still holding within the immedidate 900-950 stg range,&quot; said one. Fish is the managing director of crop forecaster PCR Ltd.</p>
<p>News Ghana cocoa purchases to sixth week of the 1996/97 season ending November 21 fell to 18,529 tonnes from 28,686 in the same period a year earlier was viewed as bullish.</p>
<p>But traders said the news, along with some latest Ivorian arrival figures, had no positive impact on the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The market won't do much with the sizeable cocoa in the hands of a trade house hanging over the market,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Volume totalled 5,180 lots. The active March/March switch was trading at 70-72 stg.</p>
