<headline>Oversold LME aluminium perks up in Asian trade.</headline>

<p>London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month aluminium was trading slightly firmer on Thursday on technical factors in Asia despite a weaker tone in Tokyo aluminium futures, Far East traders said.</p>
<p>Three-month aluminium was trading at $1,553 a tonne at 0540 GMT, up from the late Wednesday LME close of $1,549.</p>
<p>&quot;The aluminium market appears a bit oversold with the 14-day relative strength index at 32.07,&quot; an LG Futures trader said.</p>
<p>The market generally considers an RSI of 70 or more as overbought and 30 or less as oversold.  </p>
<p>But TOCOM's benchmark February aluminium contract fell to 203.8 yen per kg at 0540 GMT, down 1.4 yen from Wednesday's close of 205.2 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;Aluminium fell slightly on producer selling and arbitrage trading in lacklustre trading,&quot; said a trader at Japanese broker Okachi and Co Ltd.</p>
<p>The Okachi trader said some arbitragers were buying gold and selling aluminium on TOCOM.</p>
<p>LME aluminium stocks are expected to fall about 2,000 tonnes on Thursday, which should support prices, the LG trader said.  </p>
<p>Broker Brandeis said in its daily aluminium report that the appearance of a small bearish engulfing pattern on the candlestick chart indicated a test of support around $1,535 a tonne. On the upside, it pegged resistance at $1,560.</p>
<p>Three-month copper is expected to range-trade between $2,240 to $2,300 a tonne due to a lack of fresh fundamental factors.</p>
<p>&quot;If copper cannot breach its current psychological resistance at $2,300 a tonne, it may fall further to $2,180 a tonne,&quot; the LG trader said.</p>
<p>Three-month copper was firmer at $2,263 a tonne at 0530 GMT, up from late Wednesday's LME close of $2,260.  </p>
<p>The trader LME copper stocks are also expected to fall by about 1,500 tonnes on Thursday.</p>
<p>Brandeis said three-month zinc prices closed technically negatively on Wednesday, wiping out all of Tuesday's gains, after briefly breaching resistance at the 10-day moving average at $1,245 a tonne. A test of $1,230 a tonne seemed likely with the next support pegged at $1,225/$1,220, it said.</p>
