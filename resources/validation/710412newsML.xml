<p>Vietnam on Monday played down a visit last week by Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and reiterated a statement that the Khmer leader had merely been on vacation.</p>
<p>A foreign ministry official told Reuters by phone that Hun Sen, whose forces ousted his co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh over the weekend, &quot;did not meet with any Vietnamese leader&quot; during his stay in Vietnam and had now returned home.</p>
<p>She gave no further details of the visit, but a separate statement said Hanoi viewed the current situation in Cambodia with concern.</p>
<p>&quot;On the one hand Vietnam views this as an internal affair of Cambodia,&quot; it said. &quot;On the other, as a country which has friendly relations with Cambodia, Vietnam hopes the different parties will use restraint and seek a peaceful resolution to the situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Hun Sen, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, was installed as the head of the government which came to power in Cambodia following Vietnam's 1978 invasion. He formed an uneasy coalition with Ranariddh following U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.</p>
<p>Analysts in Hanoi said on Monday the government was concerned that anti-Vietnamese sentiment might re-emerge as a dominant political theme in the wake of the Hun Sen takeover, from both his opponents and supporters.</p>
<p>But officials in southern Vietnam said the situation in Phnom Penh in recent weeks was already being reflected in increased tension along the frontier between the two countries.</p>
<p>The officials told Reuters that around 1,000 ethnic Vietnamese had returned to Vietnam recently because of concerns over their safety.</p>
<p>They said a number of traders who crossed into Cambodia had been beaten and robbed, and added that a formal protest had been made after soldiers began building a canal in the border area in violation of an agreement to keep each other informed in advance of such moves.</p>
<p>Details and dates of the alleged incidents were not given.</p>
