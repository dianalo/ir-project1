<headline>LME copper, aluminium stocks seen down slightly.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-03-14</dateline>

<p>Far East base metal traders predicted that copper and aluminium inventories on the London Metal Exchange (LME) will probably post a modest decline later on Friday.</p>
<p>Copper stocks are seen dipping 1,000-3,000 tonnes while aluminium inventories are likely to fall by 2,000-5,000 tonnes when the LME report is released at 0900 GMT, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe copper will be down 1,000 to 2,000 tonnes,&quot; the general manager of a Japanese metal trading company said. &quot;Aluminium will be down 2,000-3,000 tonnes.&quot;  </p>
<p>Metal broker Brandeis, however, said in its daily report copper stocks should post a drawdown of 2,000-3,000 tonnes</p>
<p>&quot;I expect a small decline in aluminium stocks. It could be in the region of 5,000 tonnes,&quot; an aluminium dealer for a major European metal trading house said.</p>
<p>Demand for aluminium around the region remained brisk, although stocks in the LME's Singapore warehouse reached 17,675 tonnes in the LME stocks report last Tuesday, unchanged from the previous Friday's report.  </p>
<p>There were no reports of copper arriving in Singapore although small amounts of material could be placed on warrant at the LME warehouse here.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people holding copper have apparently decided to place their material on warrant,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The volume of copper in the LME's warehouse in the city-state reached 54,800 tonnes in its stocks report last Tuesday, up 1,725 tonnes from last Friday's LME report.</p>
<p>Three-month copper was seen by regional dealers at about US$2,331/36 a tonne at 0200 GMT, little changed from the late quote in London on Thursday of $2,332/35 a tonne.  </p>
<p>Three-month aluminium was seen by the same dealers at about $1,654/58 a tonne at 0200 GMT, also barely changed from the level in London yesterday of $1,655/58 a tonne.</p>
