<p>European bourses clawed back their morning losses on Friday as bargain-hunters bought up stock unloaded because of jitters over Wall Street's poor performance this week.</p>
<p>On currency  markets, the dollar touched a 33-month high against the yen and strengthened slightly on the mark after German central bank comments that interest rate cuts were still possible in the medium-term.</p>
<p>European bourses began the day with their confidence sapped by a poor performance in New York on Thursday and slipped as investors opted to cash in profits from a recent bull run.</p>
<p>But London and Paris bounced back to show gains in mid-afternoon and Frankfurt recovered some poise, although floor trading closed in the minus column.</p>
<p>The European bourses were given a boost when Wall Street perked up after an unsteady opening because of inflation worries when U.S. data showed orders for expensive manufactured goods jumped in September.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods rose 4.6 percent, the largest increase in nearly four years, to a seasonally adjusted $174.1 billion as strong demand more than erased a very weak showing in the prior month.</p>
<p>London and Paris climbed strongly as markets digested the figures and apparently concluded they did not hold threats of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The overall number suggests goods production is still moderate and does not demand any immediate attention from the Fed (central bank)&quot; said Waldo Best, senior economist at BZW Securities Inc in New York.</p>
<p>In London, Europe's biggest bourse, traders said they expected cash-rich institutions would use recent declines as an opportunity to increase equity holdings.</p>
<p>&quot;You will have nervous bouts from time to time but there are too many people out there sitting with surplus cash,&quot; said the head of equity trading at one leading brokerage.</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 undex had earlier sunk further below the 4,000 mark, extending three days of losses against a background of Wall Street weakness where the Dow fell 44 points on Thursday to below 6,000, a key benchmark breached two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The boom in markets has largely been fuelled by recent data showing subdued inflation in the powerful American economy and an optimistic outlook for rates.</p>
<p>In Paris, stocks reversed their early losses and climbed 0.6 percent as New York turned higher after its nervous opening, driving the Dow index back above the key 6,000-point level.</p>
<p>Rhone-Poulenc was a star performer, climbing 3.16 percent after the group announced a big rise in third-quarter net income.</p>
<p>Frankfurt recovered most of its losses as investors interpreted the central bank's hints of lower interest rates as good for business. Floor trading ended marginally down but computerused deals climbed in the afternoon.</p>
<p>On the foreign exchanges, the dollar perked up against the mark after the news on prospects for German interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Our interest rate expectations model suggests the dollar is pretty comfortably placed again and dollar buying strategies from here are favoured,&quot; said Joe Prendergast, foreign exchange strategist at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke said a further cut in the German securities repurchase rate would be possible mid-term under certain circumstances. He told reporters while attending a conference that in the medium term &quot;a repo rate cut is still possible depending on developments.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. currency also hit a peak of 113.35 yen as the belief took hold that Japanese interest rates would remain low for some time.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1400 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 1.5240 marks and 113.35 yen compared with 1.5230 and 112.90 yen on Thursday.</p>
<p>STOCKS AT 1400 GMT</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 index was up 22.8 at 4022.2</p>
<p>Germany's DAX index closed down 4.21 at 2674.22.</p>
<p>The Paris CAC-40 index was up 16.78 at 2,168.40.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed in the afternoon at $382.55 an ounce, compared with the close in London on Thursday of $383.10. Silver was up two cents at $4.93.</p>
