<p>The NYMEX oil complex closed higher mostly on bullish inventory data, but gasoline led gains with the threat that Tropical Storm Fran will head toward the Hess refinery on St. Croix in the Carribean, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's mainly a reaction to the storm and off the API,&quot; said a trader of gasoline's rise on Wednesday. September gasoline settled up 1.09 cents to 62.25 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>The American Petroleum Institute (API) said Tuesday that weekly gasoline stocks dropped a higher-than-expected 2.24 million barrels.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now it appears that Fran will move north of Saint Croix but this needs to be closely watched,&quot; said Jon Davis, a weather forecaster with Smith Barney in Chicago.  </p>

<p>October crude oil closed up 15 cents to $21.69 barrel, retreating from its intraday high of $22.10. A report that Iraq may be massing troops in northern Kurdish regions fueled crude's gains during the day, traders said.</p>
<p>September heating oil settled 0.92 cent higher at 61.95 cents a gallon. API reported a draw of 463,000 barrels of distillate stocks, with heating oil stocks already at historical lows.  </p>
<p>Although API reported crude stocks increased a suprising 10.4 million barrels for the week ended August 23, traders said crude was swept up by the rally in refined products.</p>
<p>Gasoline, which usually rallys before the summer when there is traditionally peak demand, may extend its gains and experience a second rally at summer's end, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There has always been talk that gasoline tends to have a late summer rally, so this might be the swan song,&quot; said Prudential Securities trader Nauman Barakat.</p>
<p>However, Thomas Blakeslee of Cargill Investor Services said September gasoline's rise was partly due to a technical bounce from its trading near the price of heating oil.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a significant drop in gasoline stocks though we have seen little downside after gasoline starts to trade near heating oil's price,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Blakeslee said the market may continue to trend higher on the inventory data this week, but he said there is need for prices to consolidate.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still in a toppy phase, though it may come up a bit more,&quot; he said, adding October crude could test $23.00 a barrel.</p>
