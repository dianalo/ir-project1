<p>CoreStates Financial Corp said Monday its president, Rosemarie Greco, is leaving the company for personal reasons effective early 1998.</p>
<p>Greco is also president and chief executive officer of its unit, CoreStates Bank, the company said.</p>
<p>Terrence Larsen, chairman and chief executive officer of the corporation and the bank, will assume the post of president in both entities immediately, it said.</p>
<p>Greco's other management responsibilities will be divided among several senior executives, it added.  </p>
<p>Greco will continue to report to Larsen through the transition until her departure, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Rosemarie has made her influence felt throughout the CoreStates organization and she will be truly missed,&quot; said Larsen, who noted that Greco had &quot;done a lot to build and change our organization.&quot;</p>
<p>Greco, who is leaving CoreStates after six years, said it is an &quot;opportune time&quot; for her to step back and take a fresh look at her personal directions, now that the company &quot;is settling down after intense efforts of process redesign and bank mergers and is taking a fresh look at its strategic directions.&quot;</p>
