<p>The Bank of Canada plans to auction C$500 million of 356-day treasury bills today, the central bank said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The bills will be dated and delivered on August 15 and will mature on August 6, 1998, the Bank of Canada said.</p>
<p>Tenders will be received no later than 1130 EDT/1530 GMT today and results will be released at 1215 EDT/1615 GMT today.  </p>
<p>The reopening of the one-year T-bill comes after trading of the issue was distorted by a major squeeze which came to light following yesterday's auction, dealers said. The Bank of Canada yesterday sold C$1.0 billion of T-bills due August 6, which produced an average yield 3.886 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said there is speculation a major U.S. player was responsible for the squeeze.</p>
<p>While the central bank's decision to reopen the issue was seen as positive, dealers said it may not be enough to cover to meet the market's needs.  </p>
<p>&quot;The issue's too small. I know of C$600 million (owing) myself so C$500 million is not going to satisfy that, and it still leaves the door open for it to be scooped,&quot; said one T-bill dealer with a bank-owned brokerage. &quot;The participants that own the present issue will probably come back and rebid for this issue.&quot;</p>
<p>The dealer said market participants recommended to the central bank that it reopen the issue and were pleased that it happened.</p>
<p>&quot;It will help. I think the street is short more than the C$500 million but it will make a difference,&quot; said another T-bill trader with a bank-owned brokerage. &quot;It's a very positive thing for the bank to do, and I think it will help for down the road.&quot;</p>
<p>The one-year T-bill due August 6, 1998 traded with a yield of 3.72 percent after the reopening was announced, compared with a yield of 3.95 percent at the close of trading on Tuesday.</p>
