<p>Prime Minister John Major on Wednesday declared Britain was the &quot;Clean Man of Europe&quot; as the government announced what it said was the world's first national strategy to achieve &quot;major reductions&quot; in air pollutants.</p>
<p>&quot;I want children to have to ask their parents what did poor air quality mean', just as my children have to ask me what smog was,&quot; environment secretary John Gummer told BBC radio.</p>
<p>The new strategy sets targets for maximum levels in the air of eight key pollutants -- carbon monoxide, benzene, butadiene, ozone, particulates, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and lead -- to be achieved by the year 2005.</p>
<p>Under it, local councils will get increased powers to tackle pollution by spot checks on vehicles, and to close roads and divert traffic from pollution blackspots.</p>
<p>In an article in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, Major wrote: &quot;We are now the &quot;Clean Man of Europe&quot; and a global leader in the field -- ahead of most other countries in delivering cuts in greenhouse gases.&quot;</p>
<p>But Michael Meacher, spokesman on environmental protection for the opposition Labour Party, claimed that Gummer's efforts to improve air quality had been &quot;repeatedly sabotaged, obstructued and overruled&quot; by other government departments.</p>
<p>&quot;By contributing to our appalling transport crisis through bus deregulation, rail privatisation and rising road chaos, the Government is itself responsible for much of the pollution problem millions of people are now facing,&quot; he said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 5427767</p>
