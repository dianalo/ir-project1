<p>Financial markets predict the European Union to confirm within three months expectations the currency fixing rates for nations starting European economic and monetary union (EMU) will remain at their existing central exchange rate mechanism (ERM) rates.</p>
<p>Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer's comments on Thursday suggested finance ministers and central bankers will decide on the method by which the exchange rates will be irrevocably locked at an informal meeting in Luxembourg in September.</p>
<p>&quot;It is necessary for the markets to know in good time how the final exchange rates are fixed,&quot; Tietmeyer said in a speech.</p>
<p>As market expectations for a punctual EMU start have surged over the past 18 months, currencies seen starting the project have gravitated to their ERM parities or levels consistent with a fixing at these rates on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been a number of different methods touted around, but my suspicion is they will be happy to endorse the market's assumption of the ERM parities, even despite some anomalies like in Ireland,&quot; said Mark Geddes, treasury economist at ABN Amro.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 1997, the punt has been trading more than 10 percent above its ERM midrate against the core bloc of EMU candidates. It has been pulled up by its soaring neighbour, sterling, and an attractive Irish interest rate premium over the German mark.</p>
<p>The countries starting EMU are expected to be decided in April or May of 1998.</p>
<p>There are three main suggestions on what rates should be chosen as the eventual currency fixings. They include using the ERM central rates and using the rate at which the currency is trading on the day of the fixing.</p>
<p>Analysts said the latter is flawed because it leaves no reference for markets, encourages last-minute volatility and may leave currencies open to eleventh-hour jockeying by governments for more competitive fixings.</p>
<p>The last proposal is to agree to convert the currencies at an average trading rate over a set period of time, analysts said. This would allow currencies like the punt to adopt a higher rate than its ERM parity and limit the need for spot downside in the interim.</p>
<p>But analysts said the EU could opt for ERM rates and make an exception for Ireland, if necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;The surge in Ireland in incomes, growth and asset prices is probably sustainable because it is largely a once-off, catch-up adjustment with the rest of Europe,&quot; said Peter Maydell, senior currency economist at UBS. &quot;As a result, the currency can be sustained at higher levels and exceptions could be made on that basis.&quot;</p>
