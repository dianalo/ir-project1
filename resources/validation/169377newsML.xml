<p>Russia plans to liberalise the way in which goods are exported and imported by holding tenders to select companies to carry out transactions in goods subject to quotas, the official Itar-Tass news agency said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It said the government had approved measures under which the right to export and import commodities, work and services subject to quotas would be tendered openly and publicly.</p>
<p>Tass made no specific mention of oil, for which companies apply for and receive quotas to export but for which the process is not done on a purely commercial, transparent basis.</p>
<p>The measures, when applied to the oil sector, could introduce more competitiveness.</p>
<p>Tass said Moscow would set up an interdepartmental commission to organise tenders and announce them no less than 30 days before they are to be held.</p>
<p>Auctions for rights to trade in goods subject to quotas would be held on various stock and commodities exchanges.</p>
<p>Tass also said the government had approved new measures to license importers and exporters of goods, work and services, but gave no details.</p>
