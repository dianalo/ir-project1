<p>Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, will not lower its key interest rate, the repo rate, from its current level of 4.10 percent at its weekly operation on Tuesday, a Reuters poll of 10 economists found on Monday.</p>
<p>However the economists were not saying the bank's lowering of the repo rate was over.</p>
<p>&quot;The rumours about the spring budget proposal (to be released on Tuesday) are not worrying and the crown is heading in the right direction,&quot; said Marco Pianelli, Nomura Bank economist.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures tomorrow will show that there is room for more cuts. In a month or so I think that the rate will be lowered.&quot;</p>
<p>Finance Minister Erik Asbrink will present the Social Democratic government's spring budget proposal at 1100 GMT on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In addition, Statistics Sweden will release March CPI figures at 0715 GMT on Tuesday with analysts in a Reuter poll expecting a 0.4 percent rise in March from February, for a year-on-year fall of 0.4 percent.</p>
<p>However some economists said that if the crown did not start to show a stronger trend in coming months then the time to lower the repo would start to run out. Last year the Riksbank cut the repo 25 times, from a starting level of 8.91 percent. The repo is the bank's key tool for controlling money market liquidity.</p>
<p>While the repo currently stands at 4.10 percent, the bank's other key rates, the deposit and lending rates, stand at 3.75 percent and 5.25 percent respectively.</p>
<p>Economists interviewed for the poll were from Carnegie, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Handelsbanken, HSBC Midland Bank, Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber, Paribas, S-E-Banken, Swedbank, and Unibank Markets.</p>
