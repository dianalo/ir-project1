<p>The head of France's largest labour union, the CFDT, said on Tuesday she did not expect the government's tough budget austerity plans to spark a rerun of last year's strikes which paralysed the country.</p>
<p>&quot;I really don't see it happening,&quot; Nicole Notat, the union's secretary general, told the France Inter radio.</p>
<p>She was asked if unhappiness over the government's plans for 1997 could trigger the same kind of public sector protests seen in November and December last year.</p>
<p>She said, however, that she believed that the autumn would be marked by sporadic labour unrest.</p>
<p>French unions had been predicting a tough ride for the government over its belt-tightening programme, but of late their warnings have sounded more muted.</p>
<p>So far, only unions in the education sector have clearly talked of a strike to protest against job cuts expected under the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>Statements by the Communist-led CGT and the Force Ouvriere, which spearheaded last year's strikes, did not herald massive upheaval, Notat said.</p>
<p>The CGT, Notat said, was sounding &quot;very low-key&quot;.</p>
<p>Marc Blondel, head of Force Ouvriere &quot;is having a family gathering in Paris,&quot; she said, referring to the union's plans for a big protest march on September 21.</p>
<p>&quot;All of this does not seem to indicate a very, very big enthusiasm...Perhaps simply because we know today that it's not enough to press on a button. The will of union leaders alone is not sufficiient for people to spring into action,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Conservative Prime Minister Alain Juppe has said that the 1997 budget will freeze spending at 1996 levels, implying a spending cut of about 60 billion francs.</p>
<p>The move is a key step to reducing France's core deficit to three percent of gross domestic product as part of a drive to qualify for joining a single European currency.</p>
