<title>CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: French troops tighten hold on Bangui after mutiny.</title>

<dateline>BANGUI 1996-11-17</dateline>

<p>French troops and the presidential guard tightened their grip on the Central African Republic capital Bangui on Sunday as some dissident local soldiers vowed to pursue a revolt started the day before.</p>
<p>National radio's short-wave and medium wave transmissions went off the air abruptly on Sunday and staff said mutineers disconnected the transmitter south of the capital.    Residents</p>
<p>said tension was high in the city's southern districts which appeared to be a stronghold of mutineers who revolted on Saturday, apparently over a bid to arrest an army captain related to former military leader Andre Kolingba.</p>
<p>Some soldiers contacted by telephone at their Kassai barracks outside the capital said they would continue their protest until the return of President Ange-Felix Patasse, who is attending the World Food Summit in Rome.</p>
<p>&quot;He is the only one who can resolve our problem,&quot; one soldier told Reuters. Officials said Patasse was expected to return later on Sunday or on Monday.</p>
<p>Patasse agreed some concessions after a more serious army mutiny in May in which the city was ransacked until French troops stationed in the former French colony put down the revolt. Troops mutinied in April over pay and conditions.</p>
<p>The city centre remained deserted on Sunday with French and heavily armed units of the presidential guard preventing people from passing through the business district, residents said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jean-Paul Ngoumpande, in a broadcast address to the nation, on Saturday urged soldiers to hold their fire and to return their weapons to their respective armouries.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing would be more serious for the country than a new bloody episode among its children,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>France has an important military base in Central African Republic, one of the world's poorest countries, under a defence accord as with many of its former African colonies. Patasse, a civilian, invoked the accord in May to secure French help.</p>
<p>There was no word on two allies of Patasse whom witnesses said were seized by mutineers on Saturday. They are the general secretary of Patasse's ruling Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People, Joseph Vermond Tchendo, and the head of the national police force, Ernest Latakpi.</p>
