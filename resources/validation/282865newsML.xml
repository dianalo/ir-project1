<p>Millions of revellers around Europe celebrated the New Year in traditional loud and exuberant fashion, apparently little daunted by continued freezing weather which has killed well over 100 people across the continent since Christmas.</p>
<p>In snow-bound Belgrade, celebrations mixed with politics as at least a quarter of a million held a huge rally to underline their demands for democracy in Serbia and their opposition to the autocratic rule of President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
<p>Some 200,000 braved Paris's coldest New Year for 27 years to throng the French capital's famous Champs Elysees boulevard in temperatures which touched minus 11 degrees Celsius (12 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>About 90,000 packed London's Trafalgar Square at midnight, singing, dancing and kissing as 1997 arrived. But the British capital's crowds paled beside the 350,000 who marked the traditional Scottish &quot;Hogmanay&quot; in the streets of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The bitter weather, which caused five more deaths in Britain as the New Year approached, gave London revellers some heartstopping moments when Big Ben, the world-famous bell in the tower of the House of Commons, was silenced on New Year's Eve after the timing mechanism of the clock froze.</p>
<p>Technicians were rushed in and managed to de-ice the works in time for the chimes to ring out as usual at the witching hour.</p>
<p>The New Year brought relief to 148 people trapped by avalanches in a road tunnel in Russia's Caucasus mountains for almost a week.</p>
<p>Rescue teams using helicopters finally ferried them to safety, leaving behind some 60 people, mainly drivers who did not want to abandon their vehicles in the tunnel.</p>
<p>In Rome, two Italians and a Moroccan sprinkled the muddy waters of the Tiber river with sparkling wine before plunging in from the Cavour bridge, cheered by hundreds of onlookers, to maintain a New Year tradition begun in 1946.</p>
<p>The midnight bathers were helped by a sudden easing of the 10-day cold snap in the &quot;eternal city&quot;, although conditions remained harsh elsewhere in Italy, with Milan, Turin, Genoa and other cities being blanketed by fresh snow.</p>
<p>Genoa airport was closed for most of Tuesday and provincial roads throughout the country remained blocked or hazardous.</p>
<p>In Austria, some 150,000 people waltzed into 1997 in the streets of Vienna despite fresh snowfalls up to 30 centimetres (12 inches) deep which hit most regions of the Alpine country.</p>
<p>The Danube River, Europe's busiest east-west waterway, was closed to all shipping on a 200-km (125-mile) stretch from the Upper Austrian town of Linz to Vienna.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless there is a huge blast of warmer weather, the Danube will remain closed for at least another eight days,&quot; a shipping police spokesman said.</p>
<p>Ice has also forced closure of all inland waterways in Germany except the River Rhine and blocked access to some small Baltic Sea ports.</p>
<p>But the weather, with temperatures down to minus 20C (minus 4F), did not stop 40,000 revellers turning out at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate to see in the New Year.</p>
<p>Officials in Poland, which has suffered some of the most severe weather with temperatures plunging to minus 37C (minus 34F) in places, said deaths from the cold now totalled 29.</p>
<p>Poland was second only to Romania in cold-related deaths. The director of Bucharest city morgue was quoted on Tuesday as saying 43 people had died in the Romanian capital alone.</p>
<p>Romanians ushered in the New Year shaken by an earth tremor measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale, which struck the eastern part of the country and was felt in Bucharest. There were no reports of casualties or damage.</p>
<p>Polish scientists had an unusual New Year fear: an African warthog, which escaped from captivity last April, could die in the freezing weather.</p>
<p>The pig, which has been sighted but eluded recapture, has become something of a folk mascot since its dash for freedom.</p>
<p>The New Year also saw the start of a new life for two Slovenian bears, freed in the French Pyrenees to start their first hibernation together on New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>Ziva and Melba, who will be tracked by satellite transmitters round their necks, are part of a plan to revive a once-thriving bear population in the region.</p>
