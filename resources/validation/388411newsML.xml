<p>Four former East German intelligence officers who are on trial for sheltering some of West Germany's most wanted guerrillas argued in court on Wednesday they had done a good deed by preventing potential attacks in the West.</p>
<p>Harry Dahl, 67, chief of the counter-terrorism department in the once feared Ministry for State Security (Stasi), and three officers, Guenter Jaeckel, 62, Hans-Hermann Petzold, 52, and Gerd Zaumseil, 48, are accused of prevention of justice.</p>
<p>The sensational case is the latest to try to establish how far East Berlin supported international terrorism and punish those behind an &quot;unholy alliance&quot; between the Stasi and the leftist Red Army Faction (RAF), that struck fear into the West German establishment during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Helmut Altenbuchner-Koenigsdorfer accused the men of granting the 10 entry into East Germany, giving them false identities, financial support, flats and jobs to assimilate them into everyday life there from 1980 to 1990.</p>
<p>&quot;In this way they prevented the terrorists from being brought to justice in West Germany,&quot; he told the court.</p>
<p>But Dahl, whom the guerrillas used to call &quot;Comrade Harry&quot;, told the court the Stasi did not take them in because they approved of their deeds but to prevent further attacks.</p>
<p>&quot;No political or security damage was done to West or East Germany. On the contrary, jailing them would have led to more attacks. We closed the vicious circle,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dahl said the 10 were taken in on orders from former Stasi chief Erich Mielke, adding: &quot;Such an explosive case could not have been decided without the head of state, Erich Honecker.&quot;</p>
<p>The West German authorities had indications from sources, including the CIA, where the ten guerrillas were, he said.</p>
<p>Dahl said Mielke's deputy, Bruno Beater, had told him there had been a secret agreement on East Berlin taking in the RAF guerrillas between Honecker and ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt -- but admitted he had no proof of such a deal.</p>
<p>Prosecutors keen to nail the men who forged links with urban guerrillas dropped an investigation allegations that the Stasi actively supported terrorism for lack of proof. Despite legal difficulties, they vowed to press on with this case.</p>
<p>Usually former East German citizens can only be punished for deeds in the Communist country under East German law -- but this case was different, the prosecution argued.</p>
<p>&quot;The accused acted in East Germany but their actions had their effect in West Germany,&quot; Altenbuchner-Koenigsdorfer said.</p>
<p>Presiding Judge Peter Faust said the next hearing on February 26 would probably deal with the issue of whether federal law can indeed be applied to the ex-Stasi officers and a verdict was possible at the third hearing on March 5.</p>
<p>It was unlikely the former guerrillas would be called as witnesses and meet their erstwhile protectors face to face once again, as Faust said the link between them was not disputed.</p>
<p>The accused argued that by sheltering the guerrillas they succeeded in preventing far more serious crimes.</p>
<p>&quot;Our clients took the terrorists out of circulation and helped them lead normal lives,&quot; Petzold's lawyer, Manfred Studier, said. &quot;What is more serious? To halt their prosecution in West Germany or to prevent further bomb attacks?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>Petzold argued it would have been &quot;high treason&quot; to hand the guerrillas to Bonn once East Berlin had taken them in.</p>
<p>The arrests of the 10 guerrillas in the summer of 1990 shocked Germans on both sides of the Cold War divide and prompted many to ponder what the proponents of armed revolutionary struggle had in common with the rulers of a stagnant Communist regime.</p>
<p>Some of the guerrillas were regarded as some of West Germany's most dangerous criminals. Susanne Albrecht had been wanted for her part in the 1977 murder of banker Juergen Ponto, the chairman of Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Silke Maier-Witt and Monika Helbing were wanted in connection with the 1977 kidnapping and murder of Employers' Federation chief Hanns-Martin Schleyer and other RAF attacks.</p>
<p>Eight were convicted and sentenced to between six years and six months and 13 years jail. Two were freed because the statute of limitations on their alleged crimes had run out. Inge Viett, the last to be freed, left jail last month.</p>
