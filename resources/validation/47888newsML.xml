<p>Strategic alliances will be crucial to survival in the fast-growing oil industry of the Asia-Pacific region, which will emerge as the world's biggest oil consumer beyond 2000, a senior economist said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Mixed marriages are the wave of the future,&quot; said Dennis O'Brien, managing director of Petroad and president of the International Association for Energy Economics in the United States.  </p>
<p>&quot;The marriage of fuels and electric power is the rage, and technology and investment costs for liquefied natural gas are moderate,&quot; he told the 12th Asia-Pacific Petroleum Conference in Singapore.</p>
<p>He said &quot;mixed marriages of firms which will combine a wide range of fuels -- oil, gas, coal -- and electric power may alter the picture of the industry we'll have in the next century&quot;.</p>
<p>U.S. energy company Enron Corp was leading the pack while companies like Unocal Corp and Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA were looking into electric power projects, O'Brien said.  </p>
<p>The Asia-Pacific region would see upstream companies forming strategic alliances between local and global players, and national oil companies privatising and becoming regional players in the future, he said.</p>
<p>O'Brien said Japanese and Korean refiners were facing deregulation and tough competition in their domestic markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Some will move from domestic to strong regional and global players in five to 10 years time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the entry of new players into the downstream sector would continue to be expensive, difficult, and require a long investment horizon, he said.  </p>
<p>Capacity expansion in the region is expected to slow down after 1997, reflecting the weaker refining margins of the past few years.</p>
<p>&quot;Major refinery capacity additions are coming on stream in 1996 and 1997 which were planned in 1991-92,&quot; said O'Brien. &quot;But the capacity growth will slow post 1997 due to poor margins in 1994 and 1995.&quot;</p>
<p>But the oil demand will show strong growth in Asia driven by explosive economic growth.  </p>
<p>O'Brien said oil consumption from the Asia-Pacific region was likely to reach 40 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2020, more than 40 percent of world's demand.</p>
<p>Asia-Pacific's net oil product imports were expected to grow to five million bpd in 2005 from 2.5 million bpd now and net oil imports to over 15 million bpd from nine million bpd, he said.</p>
