<p>By David Morgan</p>
<p>In a deal combining the nation's two largest networks of rehabilitation centres, HealthSouth Corp. said Tuesday it was acquiring Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. for about $900 million in stock and the assumption of about $700 million in debt.</p>
<p>HealthSouth, which became the United States' largest provider of outpatient health care services mainly through acquisitions, said Horizon/CMS stockholders would receive 0.42169 share of HealthSouth for each share of Horizon they own.</p>
<p>The deal was expected to close at midyear, barring regulatory delay by U.S. antitrust officials.</p>
<p>Horizon's stock jumped $2.50 to $16.75 on the New York Stock Exchange after the deal was announced. Stock in HealthSouth, which also trades on the NYSE, slipped $2.25 to $40.875.</p>
<p>The combined company will have one-fourth of U.S. outpatient rehabilitation centres and almost two-thirds of all 190 rehabilitation hospitals.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Horizon/CMS will also add 12 new markets in which the merged company can provide outpatient surgery and rehabilitation services.</p>
<p>&quot;If we were to go out and try to build this network that we're acquiring, it'd take a lifetime,&quot; HealthSouth Chairman Richard Scrushy told reporters and Wall Street analysts in a conference call.</p>
<p>&quot;Once we own these hospitals and these outpatient centres, that pretty much shuts out any other health care company from ever getting into our business in a significant way.&quot;</p>
<p>Annual revenues for the new company would reach about $5 billion at the outset.</p>
<p>Industry analysts said that while the deal would allow a reduction in costs for the combined company, increasing its revenues would present more of a challenge over a longer period.</p>
<p>&quot;The easiest part to accomplish is the cost-cutting side, and some of that you can probably accomplish in the first six months after you close the deal,&quot; said brokerage PaineWebber's Helen O'Donnell.</p>
<p>&quot;Then the other part is building the revenue side, which is where they bring their contracts to Horizon hospitals, and that'll take a longer time to build. They'll start getting some benefits in about 12 months.&quot;</p>
<p>Scrushy said that by purchasing Horizon, HeathSouth was acquiring access to 50 major metropolitan areas where it had often been kept out by existing franchise agreements.</p>
<p>New markets would enable HealthSouth to wring new business out of existing contracts with national corporate clients, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Marriott International Inc. and The Coca-Cola Co.</p>
<p>Scrushy also said the acquisition puts HealthSouth in a position to take full advantage of expected reforms in Medicare, which he said would base the federally sponsored health-care programme for 30 million elderly Americans on a managed-care model.</p>
<p>He said the anticipated reforms would for the first time allow companies like his to begin making money from treating Medicare patients.</p>
<p>&quot;As we see Medicare recipients move into a managed-care environment, we're going to be sitting there in every major city in America positioned to contract for it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully, over the next 10 years in every major city with all services ... that would generate about $25 billion (in) sales. And that's our goal -- to build a company that is in every major market.&quot;</p>
<p>Horizon, based in Albuquerque, N.M., owns, leases or manages 267 long-term care facilities, a contract therapy business holding 1,400 contracts, an institutional pharmacy business serving 38,500 beds, and other health care services.</p>
<p>However, the company also has had legal, financial and regulatory problems in recent years. Just last week it agreed to spend $20 million to settle a stockholders lawsuit alleging insider trading by some officials.</p>
<p>In December, Horizon paid $5.8 million to state and federal authorities to resolve allegations of billing fraud.</p>
<p>HealthSouth, based in Birmingham, Ala., said it expects the acquisition to add to its earnings per share this year.</p>
<p>Neal Elliott, Horizon's chairman and chief executive, will join HealthSouth's board upon the merger's completion, which is expected this summer.</p>
