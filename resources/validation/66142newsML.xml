<title>USA: IMF leaves open question of gold sales to aid poor.</title>
<headline>IMF leaves open question of gold sales to aid poor.</headline>

<p>The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday endorsed stepped-up aid for the world's poorest nations, but stopped short of spelling out how it planned to pay for that.</p>
<p>The decision, announced by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, effectively left open the question of whether the Fund would sell some of its gold to help the world's poor.</p>
<p>&quot;The IMF is fully ready to assist its low-income members well into the next millenium,&quot; Camdessus said in a brief statement.</p>
<p>IMF management, backed by the United States, Britain and most other member nations, had proposed selling five million of the fund's 104 million ounces of gold if needed to help finance stepped-up assistance to poor countries.</p>
<p>But a few nations -- Germany, Italy and Switzerland -- opposed the proposal, arguing in part that the IMF should not sell gold except in cases of extreme financial emergency.</p>
<p>Wednesday's decision by the IMF board puts the proposal on the back burner for now. Although the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee may take up the issue again at a  meeting on September 29, an agreement at that time seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Camdessus said in his statement that the IMF board had reached &quot;understandings&quot; to ensure stepped-up IMF assistance to the world's poorest countries.</p>
<p>The board, which first met on the issue last Friday then took it up again today, discussed two inter-related initiatives to help poor countries -- beefing up its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and participating in a multilateral debt relief plan.</p>
<p>ESAF, which lends money at virtually no interest charge to the world's poorest nations, would be the vehicle through which the IMF would take part in the latter initiative.</p>
<p>&quot;I am pleased to announce that the executive board has reached understandings to ensure permanent continuation of the enhanced structural adjustment facility ... and allow the IMF to participate in the ... initiative for the highly-indebted poor countries,&quot; Camdessus said in his statement.</p>
<p>He added that he warmly welcomed the &quot;cooperative spirit&quot; in the board that made the understandings possible.</p>
<p>An IMF spokesman declined to elaborate further.</p>
