<p>The technical outlook for September T-bonds has taken a turn for the worse, with sell signals suggesting the market may fall as far as 113-17, if 114-23 gives way, technical analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We're getting sell signals from several indicators and on a weekly basis I would say we've seen the high,&quot; said Elli Gifford, an independent technical analyst near Cambridge.</p>
<p>By 0900 GMT, September T-bonds were up 3/32 at 114-29. They tumbled around two points on Friday after stronger than expected July payrolls data and the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index sent a shiver through the market.</p>
<p>Gifford put initial support at 114-28, followed by 114-04. She said a weak close on Friday and the fact the market was up against historic resistance anyway, meant the uptrend itself at 114-00 was looking threatened.</p>
<p>Gerry Celaya, senior technical analyst at American Express Bank in London, said if 114-23 gave way, the contract may make a quick run at 113-17 trendline support.</p>
<p>&quot;It should try to hold that, with a channel bottom marked there that should hold for a turn back to 116-00,&quot; he said in a note.</p>
<p>Celaya said the market would need to turn above 115-23/116-00 near term to see a sharp lift instead.</p>
<p>Gifford put resistance at 116-01, then 116-04, but added the market was unlikely to vault that level near term.</p>
<p>By 0915 GMT, December Eurodollars were unchanged at 94.110.</p>
