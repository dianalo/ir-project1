<p>Afghanistan's Central Asian neighbours expressed concern on Saturday that renewed fighting in the country could bring the purist Taleban militia's radical Islam to their doorsteps.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and Russia's first deputy foreign minister, Boris Pastukhov, met in the Tajik capital Dushanbe to discuss regional security concerns, and Afghanistan topped their agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;Participants in the meeting expressed their anxiety at the continuation of armed hostilites in Afghanistan and the danger of a future escalation in the Afghan conflict,&quot; a joint declaration by the five former Soviet states said.</p>
<p>The fall of the Afghan capital Kabul in September last year to the Taleban sent shock waves through the Central Asian republics.</p>
<p>Central Asian leaders, most of them former Communist Party bosses, are hostile to Islamic fundamentalism and fear Afghan chaos could spill over their common borders and undermine their own fragile stability.</p>
<p>The declaration also stated the republics' readiness for &quot;close joint action&quot; in protecting their common borders, although no details were given.</p>
<p>They also worry that a refugee crisis might develop if the Taleban push northwards against rival factions in the spring.</p>
<p>&quot;The refugee issue is of most concern to Tajikistan,&quot; a diplomat based in Dushanbe said. &quot;The Tajiks wonder who would come and what would they do when they got here,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Aid agency sources in the republic say most of the refugees, many of them ethnic Tajiks, would be fighters who could upset a nervous peace in Tajikistan, itself emerging from a four-year civil war which left tens of thousands dead.</p>
<p>Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov, who met the visiting ministers briefly on Saturday, called for the creation of an international forum to find a political solution to Afghanistan's long-running civil war, involving all factions and other interested countries.</p>
<p>However, the Taleban is determined to wrest control of Afghanistan's six remaining northern provinces.</p>
<p>Regional summits in October and January produced little but hand-wringing while the Central Asian states are far from neutral in the conflict.</p>
<p>The commander of one of Afghanistan's anti-Taleban factions and an ethnic Tajik, Ahmad Shah Masood, is already using a southern Tajik airport to send supplies to his forces inside the war-ravaged country.</p>
<p>Uzbek President Islam Karimov has urged support for General Abdul Rashid Dostum, another anti-Taleban commander in northern Afghanistan and an ethnic Uzbek, saying he is all that stands between Central Asia and the Taleban.</p>
<p>Russia has thousands of troops deployed along the Tajik-Afghan border and sees itself as a bulwark against the spread north of radical Islam into resource-rich Central Asia, a region it sees firmly within its sphere of interests.</p>
<p>But with bitter memories of its war with turbulent Afghanistan during the 1980s and with the Tajik civil war having already claimed many of its own soldiers' lives, Russia is unlikely to make any major military commitment to the region.</p>
