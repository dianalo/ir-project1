<p>Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is becoming an increasingly attractive fuel for power generators as production costs are reduced, industry sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;LNG project costs are coming down, adding to the competitiveness of LNG as a power source,&quot; said Robert Brown manager of global gas marketing at Mobil Corp told an industry conference.</p>
<p>Natural gas is expected to feed around half of the huge growth in electric power capacity over the next decade and around one third of this will be LNG, Brown said.</p>
<p>Between now and 2010, 620 gigawatts of power generation capacity will come onstream in the Asia Pacific region, while 440 gigawatts of new capacity is expected in Europe and 140 gigawatts in North America, according to forecasts by UK Power generator Powergen.</p>
<p>Most LNG consumption is currently focused in the Asia Pacific region where substantial growth in demand is anticipated for both gas distribution and power generation.</p>
<p>One problem that power generators contend with is the huge cost and long lead times of LNG projects.</p>
<p>&quot;LNG projects just add up to billions of dollars when you put the pieces together - they require plenty of time and large economies of scale,&quot; said Brown.</p>
<p>One approach taken by U.S. gas giant Enron in India is to use liquid fuels such as gas oil on an intermediate basis as a feedstock to get power projects up and running.</p>
<p>If LNG is to take off as a feedstock to the power generation sector, suppliers must offer more flexible pricing structures, said Alf Roberts, executive director of Powergen plc.</p>
<p>&quot;LNG will also have to follow piped gas by being sold on more flexible terms -- that is more risky to the seller,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Long term offtake agreements that have traditionally underwritten gas supply are becoming a thing of the past, Roberts said.</p>
