<p>A blueblood Massachusetts family has barricaded their lavish estate and appealed over the Internet for help to fend off a federal eviction.</p>
<p>John and Rhetta Sweeney refused to meet with U.S. marshals seeking to seize their 14-acre estate in Hamilton, Mass., on behalf of the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corp., which claims the couple owes $1.6 million on a delinquent loan.</p>
<p>&quot;With my background, this is the furthest thing we ever expected,&quot; John Sweeney told Reuters by telephone. His family has lived on the estate going back to his great-grandfather, who served in the cabinet of President Theodore Roosevelt and as ambassador to Italy and Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not leaving. There's no negotiation on that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Marshal's office in Boston tried to arrange a meeting Monday and has not yet decided what action to take, Deputy Chief Timothy Bane said.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand these people are not going to leave. We haven't gone up there and asked them to leave yet,&quot; he added. &quot;I don't have information that indicates that they are armed or dangerous at this point but we will check that out prior to executing the order.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sweeneys have appealed for help over the Internet (www.qui-tam.com) and said they have been contacted by many people, including militia members. &quot;We have been contacted by everybody from church members to patriots. Just the whole spectrum. This is a peaceful, non-violent showing of support,&quot; John Sweeney said.</p>
<p>Some volunteers have set up camp on the estate to patrol the property, he said. But there are no weapons on the property, he added.</p>
<p>The dispute with the FDIC goes back to a $1.6 million loan from a local bank. The bank charged that the Sweeneys defaulted on the loan but the family won a court decision awarding it $2.9 million and finding that the bank engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices.</p>
<p>But a U.S. District Court judge voided the $2.9 million award and ordered the Sweeneys to pay back the loan to the FDIC following the failure of the local bank. When they failed to pay, he ordered an eviction.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't start this thing but we certainly can't leave,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;What else can you do?&quot;</p>
