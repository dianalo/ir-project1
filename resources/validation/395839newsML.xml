<headline>China says economy to remain stable after Deng.</headline>
<text>
<p>BEIJING, Feb 21 (Reuter) China's economy will remain stable after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the China Daily on Friday quoted Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist of the State Statistical Bureau, as saying.  </p>
<p>China's economy would grow by at least 8.0 percent in 1997, Qiu was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;The economic reform, which started 17 years ago under Deng's guidance, is rooted in the hearts of the Chinese people as Deng's idea of a socialist market-oriented economy with Chinese characteristics,&quot; Qiu said.</p>
<p>Despite accelerating industrial production, China's economic performance last month was &quot;basically normal,&quot; the bureau said in a report on Thursday.</p>
<p>There would be no major adverse impacts on the national economy because of Deng's passing, the China Daily quoted Xu Hongyuang, a senior economist at the State Information Centre, as saying.</p>
