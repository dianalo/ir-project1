<headline>UK gilts end dull day marginally ahead, eye PMI.</headline>
<text>
<p>1526 GMT - UK gilts ended a dull day marginally ahead having meandered in a tight trading range most of the day. Dealers said UK PMI on Tuesday to offer some early focus. Thereafter, U.S. will hold sway with its NAPM. * Dec future settles up 1/32 at 108-19  </p>
<p>The yield spread between gilts and Bunds at 10-years widened slightly to 174 basis points from 173.</p>
<p>The Bank of England's anouncement that it will hold only two auctions before the year end had little impact. The Bank said it will hold a dual auction comprising an existing short maturity gilt (2001-2003) and an existing long (2014-2016) on October 22 and 24. Then on December 4, it will issue a new short maturity in the range of 2001 to 2003.</p>
<p>Traders said gilts had kept an eye on the speech from shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown to the Labour Party conference, but in the event it had little of interest for the market.  </p>
<p>Brown pledged &quot;iron discipline&quot; on public spending and said there would be no unsustainable dashes for growth.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really more of what we've heard before, perhaps in slightly stronger language,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>December short sterling settled at 94.02, down 0.02 on the day. March lost 0.04 to settle at 93.86.</p>
