<headline>Italian shares close higher in thin trade.</headline>
<text>
<p>1530 GMT - Italian shares closed mostly higher in a thin market, supported by bond futures strength and lira firmness, but lagged other major European exchanges on worries of political volatility after weekend municipal elections.</p>
<p>* The all-share Mibtel index finished 0.74 percent higher at 12,164 while the blue chip Mib30 ended 0.94 percent up at 18,125. Volumes were thin.</p>
<p>* &quot;It looks like we underperformed the main European markets on the back of the Communist Refoundation and centre-right gains in the elections,&quot; said a Milan-based equities salesman.  </p>
<p>* &quot;Sooner or later the outcxome of the elections wioll have repercussions on the government,&quot; said a trader. Prime Minister Romano Prodi is under pressure to push through welfare cuts which his hard-left allies, Communist Refoundation, oppose.</p>
<p>* Stet shares closed a lot firmer, rising 3.06 percent to 8,046 lire, spurred by foreign institutional buying.</p>
<p>* Fiat also made solid gains, closing 2.78 percent higher at 5,508 lire but Montedison shed 1.59 percent to 1,116 lire while Compart was down 2.34 percent to 751.4 lire after analysts were disappointment by a company presentation.  </p>
<p>* Insurers continued to put up a lacklustre perfomance, Alleanza, Ras and Sai all losing ground with Generali a shade firmer at 28,835 lire. Milan newsroom +392-66102321</p>
