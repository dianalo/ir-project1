<p>Iran remains interested in storing oil at Saldanha Bay, north of Cape Town, but talks are on the backburner pending an environment study and because Iran has no immediate need for storage, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Iranians remain interested in principle, as are we,&quot; said Mineral and Energy Affairs ministry spokesman Roland Darroll.</p>
<p>&quot;But now is not the moment to do it because in the first place we're are awaiting the environmental impact study and secondly Iran's need is not that great at the present time.&quot;</p>
<p>Should those issues be resolved, Iran and South Africa would return to the negotiating table.</p>
<p>In the meantime, South Africa has also had approaches from other oil producers interested in the possibility of using some of the Central Energy Fund's (CEF) 45-million barrel depot at Saldanha, including Saudi Arabia, Darroll said.</p>
<p>CEF chairman Roy Pithey told Reuters the whole question of commercialising the facilities at Saldanha, built to withstand the anti-apartheid oil embargo on the country, hinged first and foremost on the environmental study.</p>
<p>&quot;The discussions are in abeyance until the environmental impact study is completed...There is no way we can start talking turkey in good faith with any third party until that hurdle has been cleared,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Last week's visit to South Africa by Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani failed to advance the discussions on using some of South Africa's spare storage capacity to store 15 million barrels of Iranian crude.</p>
<p>Despite speculation that the issue would be high on the agenda, officials said they were not aware of any significant discussions on the matter during Rafsanjani's brief visit.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani said on Friday his government was still willing to discuss storing oil in South Africa, but had no reserves at present to set aside. &quot;At present we have sold our oil in advance for several months, so there is no more oil to be stored,&quot; he told a news conference in Pretoria.</p>
<p>South Africa and Iran signed a deal on August 30, 1995, for the Gulf state -- South Africa's largest supplier of crude -- to store oil at Saldanha Bay.</p>
<p>But the agreement was subject to three suspensive conditions, none of which were fulfilled by the deadline stated in the contract of end-September 1995. These were,</p>
<p>- conclusion of an environmental impact study;</p>
<p>- approval by the board of CEF;</p>
<p>- and signing of joint oil marketing agreement.</p>
<p>Since then the agreement has been technically null and void, but the CEF has continued to hold discussions with the Iranians to resolve the oustanding issues.</p>
<p>The central issue of the environmental impact study is not expected to be completed much before the end of the year.</p>
<p>South Africa historically depends on Iran for two-thirds of its 400,000 to 450,000 barrels per day of crude oil imports. However, Iran's dominance of the South African oil market has been challenged this year by a strong marketing drive by Kuwait.</p>
<p>Minerals and Energy Affairs Minister Penuell Maduna said last month that South Africa aimed to reduce its dependence on Iranian crude by lifting more oil from other origins, including Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia entered a surprise late bid for South Africa's beleaguered Mossgas fuel-from-gas plant in July and Maduna said the government wanted to look at ways of lifting Saudi crude as part of wider trade discussions.</p>
