<p>Indonesian coconut prices were stable on Friday on thin buying interest, while copra fell further because of ample supply, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The overall market sentiment remains poor because of sluggish demand. Many traders also believe that buyers will turn to olein because it's much cheaper,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Traders said coconut oil was quoted at 1,750 rupiah/kg in Jakarta, unchanged since last week, but copra fell to 730 rupiah/kg against 800 rupiah/kg last week.</p>
<p>Traders said copra supply was abundant in the Indonesian market and this had pushed the price down.  </p>
<p>Traders said palm olein, which is a coconut oil substitute, was quoted at 1,450-55 rupiah/kg in Jakarta, unchanged from Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Manila traders said on Monday coconut oil prices were expected to remain steady or weaken this week as improving production prompted traders to sell short their stocks.</p>
<p>Data released on Monday also showed coconut oil stocks in Rotterdam fell to 21,426 tonnes against 22,305 tonnes last week.</p>
