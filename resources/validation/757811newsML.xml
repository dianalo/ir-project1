<p>Thousands of soldiers started mass evacuations in eastern Germany on Friday after a second dike burst overnight, flooding parts of the Oder river area.</p>
<p>In Germany's largest peace-time military operation since World War Two, 3,000 soldiers shored up banks of the river to prevent more of the flooding that has devastated parts of central Europe.</p>
<p>Officials said about 3,000 people in the villages of Ziltendorf and Wiesenau would have to leave as a result of the breach, south of another dike which burst on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the Oderbruch area, fire sirens and church bells were sounded and local television broadcast messages warning 5,000 residents in around 15 villages to prepare for evacuation after the foundations of a dike were swept away by the river.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the local crisis centre said 300 helpers were working to shore up the dike and prevent it bursting.</p>
<p>Authorities estimate up to 19,000 of the 20,000 people who live in Oderbruch would have to be evacuated in the event of widespread flooding.</p>
<p>About 1,500 border guards were helping the emergency operation with 65 helicopters and 100 boats, and a further 5,400 soldiers were in the region in case the crisis worsened.</p>
<p>A spokesman for local authorities said evacuations were progressing slowly as some residents were reluctant to follow orders and leave their homes.</p>
<p>The new breach was now 75 metres (yards) wide and would probably open up to 200 metres as water rushed through, he said.</p>
<p>Water levels dropped further downstream at Frankfurt an der Oder after the breach relieved pressure.</p>
<p>But the situation was still critical in Ratzdorf, at the confluence of the Oder and Neisse rivers which form part of the border with Poland, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Germany so far has escaped the worst of the region's flooding -- the most serious in centuries -- which claimed more than 100 lives and inundated thousands of homes earlier this month in the neighbouring Czech Republic and Poland.</p>
<p>But German towns have been hit by power cuts and overflowing sewers. About 500 people were ordered to leave parts of the danger zone earlier this week, and farmers have started moving out thousands of head of livestock.</p>
