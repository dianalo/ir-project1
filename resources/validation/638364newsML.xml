<p>Shares in British drug research group Shield Diagnostics Plc rose in pre-market trading on Wednesday as a report in the Times newspaper raised bid hopes around the group, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Times report said there was market speculation of a bid from British Biotechnology Plc at 10.00 stg a share or more, valuing the company at 193 stg.  </p>
<p>Shield was up 17-1/2p at 477 by 0718 GMT in volume of 47,400 shares, while British Biotech was unchanged at 257-1/2.</p>
<p>Separately, a report in the Daily Mail noted Tuesday's 30p rise in Shield shares and said there was interest in the stock ahead of a conference in Italy, which will include a paper on Shield's heart disease prediction test.  </p>
<p>Shield managing director Gordon Hall said he had no comment on the bid talk, describing it as no more than press speculation.</p>
<p>No-one at British Biotech was immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Shield shares rose to a record 805p in mid March, more than seven times their level at the end of 1996, but fell sharply after one of the doctors involved in a trial of its products said mishandling of blood samples may have led to misleading conclusions.</p>
<p>However, the company responded by saying it still expected to see the first sales of its heart attack predictor test to go ahead this year.</p>
