<title>PHILIPPINES: Filipino Moslem extremists call Misuari traitor.</title>
<headline>Filipino Moslem extremists call Misuari traitor.</headline>

<p>The extremist Abu Sayyaf group denounced Filipino Moslem rebel chief Nur Misuari as a traitor on Tuesday for signing a peace deal with Manila and vowed to carry on fighting for an Islamic state.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no plans of killing him ... We will give him a chance to destroy himself as a politician,&quot; Abu Sayyaf spokesman Abdulah Asis said in the group's first reaction to the peace accord that ended a 24-year rebellion in which more than 120,000 people were killed.</p>
<p>Misuari heads the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), the biggest Moslem guerrilla group in the southern Philippines.</p>
<p>The military has described the Abu Sayyaf as the most radical of several rebel groups operating in the southern islands, and blamed it for a spate of bombings, kidnappings and raids in the past three years. Abu Sayyaf has shunned any talks with Manila.</p>
<p>The peace accord which Misuari and the government signed on Monday would set up a rebel-led council to supervise development of 14 southern provinces, followed by a plebiscite and regional autonomy three years later.</p>
<p>Misuari is also running in elections on September 9 for governor of a Manila-sponsored semi-autonomous region covering four Moslem provinces.</p>
<p>&quot;He betrayed our people. He sacrificed more than 100,000 lives of civilians ... Therefore he is a traitor,&quot; Asis said in an interview with local reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;We are here to fight until the last drop of our blood. We will push ahead with our goal of an Islamic state.&quot;</p>
