<p>Rising fuel costs will push state-run Karachi Electric Supply Corp (KESC) further into the red after heavy losses in the first half of fiscal 1996/97 (July-June), its managing director said.</p>
<p>&quot;During the last 10 months or so, furnace oil prices rose by 134 percent and gas rates by 34 percent... The losses will increase as there is no solution to this problem at present,&quot; Malik Shahid Hamid told Reuters in an interview this week.</p>
<p>KESC, a power generation, transmission and distribution company, announced a first-half loss of 2.286 billion rupees ($57 million) against a profit of 654 million rupees in the same period of 1995/96.</p>
<p>At the end of 1996 it had outstanding liabilities of 5.753 billion rupees, including two billion owed to state-run Pakistan State Oil Co Ltd and one billion to Sui Southern Gas Co Ltd.</p>
<p>KESC officials say the corporation's power supply capacity will jump to 2,418 megawatts by January 1998 from 1,690 MW now after the commissioning of its own 210-MW plant in April and completion of three private power plants.</p>
<p>&quot;There won't be any power shortage in Karachi by October and we will also meet future demand,&quot; Hamid said.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is little we can do to cut losses because there is no control on the cost of fuel and power, which alone accounts for 65 percent of our expenses. Eleven percent is debt repayment and 10 percent is depreciation, totalling 86 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>KESC has asked the government to raise electricity tariffs because consumers are effectively subsidised at current rates, though Hamid said industrial users should be spared.</p>
<p>&quot;Electricity is not meant to be subsidised, but it is. Our cost of production is high because we are 100 percent based on thermal energy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have suggested that the tariff for industrial consumers be frozen at these levels, but the rates for domestic consumers be raised,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government announced after taking power last month that fuel and power prices would be frozen until June to provide relief to inflation-hit consumers.</p>
<p>&quot;For political government, it is difficult to make such unpopular decisions,&quot; stock market analyst Hina Akhlaq of KASB said of the prospects of an increase in power tariffs.</p>
<p>&quot;We recommend selling KESC shares because there are few chances of a turn-round in the company's fortunes or of its privatisation in the near future,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>KESC is a prime candidate for privatisation, but analysts say it needs restructuring and reform before it can be sold.</p>
<p>&quot;KESC's privatisation should be carried out in phases and as a first step, its management contract should be given to some well-known foreign company so its technical and administrative expertise can be used, then its distribution network should be privatised,&quot; Hamid said.</p>
<p>KESC's 10-rupee share traded at 17.20 rupees on the Karachi stock exchange on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hamid said KESC had been hit hard by power losses due to theft and a faulty distribution network.</p>
<p>&quot;On bulk distribution our losses are 2.5 to three percent, which is okay by world standards. But on internal distribution our losses stand at 31 percent against a world average of 15 percent or so,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In a system like ours, I won't say it can be brought down to 15 percent, but I would be more than happy if it was around 19 percent as each percentage point loss accounts for roughly 200 million rupees a year,&quot; Hamid said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we bring it down to eight or nine percent it would be a significant amount.&quot;</p>
