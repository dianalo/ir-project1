<p>Turkey will remain dependent on imported meals for animal feed, despite its potential to achieve self-sufficiency, feed producers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>For Turkey, with its farming and marine resources, this import dependency was disgraceful, Yavuz Koca, head of the Association of Feed Industrialists, told an international conference in the southern Turkish town of Antalya.</p>
<p>He said Turkey imported 217,000 tonnes of soy meal in 1995, up from 196,000 in 1994, 92,000 tonnes of sunflower meal, against 64,000, and 66,000 tonnes of cottonseed meal (10,000).</p>
<p>He said it was inevitable that imports would continue in the future, but gave no figures.</p>
<p>Turkey produced 4.48 million tonnes of mixed feed in 1995, up from 3.98 million a year earlier, and expects to produce at least the same amount this year. It had an established production capacity of 8.9 million tonnes at 351 plants throughout the country.</p>
<p>Koca said government efforts to raise domestic production of feed inputs had proved inconclusive.</p>
