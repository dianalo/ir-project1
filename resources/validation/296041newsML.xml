<p>Vietnam's rice market began the year on a subdued note, but prices and export business look set to perk up in the weeks ahead, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They said a flurry of shipments in the first quarter, including 60,000 tonnes to Iraq as part of a United Nations-approved oil-for-food deal, and the likelihood of a delayed spring crop in the Mekong Delta would provide support.</p>
<p>The sale to Iraq of 10-percent broken grade rice was separate from a memorandum of understanding between the two countries on the sale of rice for debt, which one trader said would amount to between 200,000 and 300,000 tonnes this year.</p>
<p>The debt, the size of which has never been disclosed, stems from aid given by Baghdad during the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Traders said there was also talk that Vietnam would ship up to 80,000 tonnes of 25-percent broken rice to Cuba and up to 30,000 tonnes to Indonesia during the first quarter.</p>
<p>However, there were no vessels currently loading at Saigon Port, where the FOB price for five percent broken grade was 275-280 a tonne compared with $280-285 on December 19.</p>
<p>Ten percent grade was also $5 lower at $265-268 a tonne and 25-percent broken was quoted at $245-250.</p>
<p>The official Vietnam News Agency quoted the Ministry of Agriculture and Information as saying that last year's rice exports were estimated at 3.1 million tonnes compared with 2.025 million in 1995.</p>
<p>With exports expected to climb at least as much again in 1997, it said Vietnam was expected to be the world's second biggest exporter of rice -- behind Thailand and ahead of India and the United States.</p>
<p>Traders said the spring crop in the country's southern rice bowl would be late because many fields were still waterlogged after recent flooding.</p>
<p>They said harvesting, which usually starts in February and continues until April, may be delayed by a month.</p>
