<p>Tokyo pledged economic aid to combat poverty in Peru after the 126-day hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador's home helped cement bilateral ties between the countries, Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador's official residence helped strengthen bilateral ties,&quot; Ikeda told Peru's Prime Minister Alberto Pandolfi, according to a briefing by the Japanese foreign ministry on meetings he held on Friday in Lima.</p>
<p>&quot;We will do whatever we can to help fight poverty,&quot; Ikeda was quoted as later telling Jorge Gonzales Izquierdo, who deputized for Peruvian Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela during an 18-week ordeal under the gun of Tupac Amaru rebels.</p>
<p>Ikeda told Gonzales Tokyo would continue to extend economic and technological assistance in its fight against poverty -- the same avowed fight the Marxist rebels claimed was at the root of their Dec. 17 hostage-taking.</p>
<p>The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels also said they targeted Japan due to its persistent &quot;meddling&quot; in the governing of Peru.</p>
<p>Ikeda praised the Peruvian government for taking a firm stand against terrorism.</p>
<p>&quot;Peru made it clear to the world that it will never give in to terrorism,&quot; Ikeda told Peruvian prime minister Pandolfi.</p>
<p>In a bloody rescue operation, Peruvian troops stormed the Japanese ambassador's home on Tuesday and freed alive all but one of the 72 hostages including 24 Japanese diplomats and businessmen.</p>
<p>Along with one Peruvian hostage, two soldiers and all 14 MRTA rebels died in the operation.</p>
<p>&quot;We regret the death of three Peruvians,&quot; Peruvian Prime Minister Pandolfi told Ikeda. &quot;But if we look at it from a different perspective, we can say we produced three heroes,&quot; Pandolfi told Ikeda.</p>
<p>President Alberto Fujimori moved on Friday to quash reports that the attack -- technically on Japanese terrirtory -- included the executions of two MRTA rebels and the killing of at least one other who tried to surrender.</p>
<p>&quot;That is completely false. There were no executions,&quot; Fujimori told Reuters in his first interview since the daring military strike.</p>
<p>Japan began injecting massive economic aid into Peru when Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, came to power in 1990.</p>
<p>Peru, home to some 80,000 people of Japanese ancestry, is the biggest recipient of Japanese economic aid in Latin America, receiving a total of 200 billion yen (about $1.6 billion) up until 1995.</p>
<p>When Japanese Prime Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, visted Lima last August, he pledged 62.8 billion yen (about $100 million) in fresh low interest development loans to Peru.</p>
