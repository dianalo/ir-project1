<title>SWITZERLAND: WTO panel finds Canada wrong in US magazine row.</title>
<headline>WTO panel finds Canada wrong in US magazine row.</headline>
<dateline>GENEVA 1997-06-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>A World Trade Organisation (WTO) dispute appeals board has ruled that Canadian taxes on local edition of foreign magazines violate global open trading rules, trade sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>The panel, the text of whose decision was not immediately available, effectively upheld most of the findings of an earlier panel which ruled against the taxes -- primarily aimed at U.S. magazines -- in February, the sources added.</p>
<p>They said the three-member board appointed by the WTO Appellate Body also agreed with the earlier panel that a postal discount for Canadian magazines funded by the Canada Heritage body also went against WTO rules.</p>
<p>Neither Canadian nor U.S. officials in Geneva, headquarters of the WTO, were immediately available for comment or confirmation of the appeals board ruling, which under the trade body's rules is initially only sent to governments involved.</p>
<p>WTO officials themselves make no comment on such rulings until they have been made public.</p>
<p>The case against Ottawa was brought by Washington following the imposition in December 1995 of an 80 per cent tax on advertising in U.S. periodicals that publish editions in Canada.</p>
<p>The tax hit the Canadian edition of Sports Ilustrated, owned by Time Warner Inc, which was subsequently closed down.</p>
<p>But Canadian government officials argued that the row arose from efforts by Canada to protect its national culture against U.S. domination.</p>
<p>The trade sources in Geneva said the appeals board -- in a detailed argument over several dozen pages -- had faulted the original panel findings on some minor legal issues.</p>
<p>&quot;But the upsum of it all is that Canada has been found firmly in the wrong,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>Under WTO rules, the organisation's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) has to adopt the appeals board ruling within the next 30 days. Adoption is by consensus, which is virtually automatic since Canada cannot block it.</p>
<p>Ottawa then is given &quot;a reasonable period of time&quot; to bring the practices found against the rules into line with the findings.</p>
<p>If it declines, the DSB -- on which all current 131 members of the WTO have a voice -- could authorise the United States to take trade sanctions against Canada to the value of the trade deemed to have been lost.</p>
