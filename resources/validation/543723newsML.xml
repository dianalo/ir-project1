<p>Asian crude prices were slightly higher on Monday but with few signs emerging that differentials were getting any firmer.</p>
<p>Oman slipped to MPM -21/-23 as a Japanese trader sold a cargo of the crude to a U.S. major. The deal surpassed the previous discount by at least one cent.</p>
<p>However, traders said they felt Oman was bottoming out for the time being.</p>
<p>They said the market was likely to adopt a holding pattern until the result of the Bangchak June buying tender emerged. The tender closes Monday and is valid until late Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Several majors and traders still had Oman to sell. A few buyers were seen, bidding at a discount of more than 20 cents.</p>
<p>Qatar Marine traded at QGPC -45 cents between a Japanese trader and a U.S. major. The price was largely in line with the market.</p>
<p>But Philippines' refiner Petron purchased a Qatar Marine from a buy tender at Dubai quotes +68 cents from a French major, giving more leeway to hedge exposure to official selling prices.</p>
<p>The Indian oil tender result helped consoliate a slight backwardation for the Dubai market, swinging from contango for most of last week.  </p>
<p>The IOC took three Dubai cargoes, indicating that most June Dubai was now placed, unless a continued rise in the Dubai spreads sparked a buyer to sell Dubai back out into the market.</p>
<p>June/July Dubai was assessed at +3/+10 cents and traders said if holders of Dubai -- who had bought as low as -10 cents last week -- were offered +10 cents, they might be tempted to lock in the profit.</p>
<p>Minas traded in line with the recent market, with a Japanese trader selling 200,000 barrels of May barrels to a Japanese refinery at ICP +10/+15 cents.</p>
