<headline>Malaysia's Mahathir defends Jackson concert.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-10-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Thursday he had allowed a Michael Jackson concert in Kuala Lumpur to give Malaysians the chance to watch a &quot;star in action&quot;, the national Bernama news agency reported.</p>
<p>&quot;We are giving fans a chance to watch a live performance of the famous entertainer,&quot; Mahathir said of the concert to be held this weekend. &quot;It is never our intention to label anything as bad because it is up to us to make our own assessment as to what is good or bad.&quot;</p>
<p>But he warned fans to behave or they would miss out on future concerts.</p>
<p>&quot;If it is out of control, it will be the last time we give our consent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The concert's organisers, Jojo Entertainment, said on Thursday that Jackson would give a second show on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mahathir's unusual defence came after weeks of controversy in Malaysia over the concert by the U.S. pop star, who last year settled a suit out of court alleging child abuse.</p>
<p>Jackson was originally scheduled to perform in central Selangor state bordering Kuala Lumpur but local authorities abruptly cancelled the show two weeks ago, saying the singer could have &quot;undesirable effects&quot; on Malaysian youth.</p>
<p>On Tuesday a pro-Islamic youth movement threatened to get a court injuction to stop the show, which has been sold out.</p>
<p>Mahathir said his government was also concerned about morality but defended Jackson: &quot;Even if we do not watch (him) but still look at pornographic books or materials over the Internet... do we need to impose a ban on the Internet?&quot;</p>
