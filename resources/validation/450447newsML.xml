<p>A bill pending in the North Carolina General Assembly would eliminate the $1.5 billion lifetime cap on bond issuance by the state's Housing Finance Agency.</p>
<p>The agency would still be barred from having more than $1.5 billion of bonds outstanding at any one time, but would have no lifetime limit, said Martha Harris, the legislative attorney who drafted the bill.</p>
<p>The proposal, SB289, was sponsored by Sen. David Hoyle, D-Dallas, at the request of the housing agency.</p>
<p>The agency has issued $1.3 billion of bonds since its inception in the late 1970s and has $865 milion currently outstanding. It plans to issue $175 million of single-family housing bonds and $25 million of multi-family housing bonds next year, said agency Finance Director Lyn Casey.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to have to raise that cap or stop issuing bonds,&quot; Casey said.</p>
<p>She said the bill was not considered controversial and was expected to pass.</p>
<p>Most North Carolina agencies have no lifetime cap on debt issuance. The limit on housing bonds was set when the agency was created, at a time when &quot;housing agencies were new and no one really new how they would work,&quot; Casey said.</p>
