<p>Bosnian leaders must agree on the design of an interim currency, a sensitive political issue, on Wednesday to clear the way for a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a fund-raising conference, Western officials said.</p>
<p>Donor countries willing to pledge $1.4 billion for Bosnia's reconstruction in 1997 want to see progress in economic reforms and an agreement with the IMF before committing funds, the officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no IMF-imposed deadline but the linkage that the donors have established between an IMF agreement and the donors' conference sets up an implicit deadline,&quot; Alessandro Zanello from IMF's Sarajevo office told Reuters.</p>
<p>A set of economic reforms was adopted in June after months of political bickering and the only obstacle in the way of the conference is the IMF agreement on a stand-by arrangement and $100 million in assistance.</p>
<p>Since late last year the IMF has sought to forge an agreement with Bosnian authorities on the country's economic programme.</p>
<p>&quot;The only major, last obstacle is the design (of the interim currency),&quot; Zanello said.</p>
<p>Other outstanding issues, including budgetary adjustments, had been largely resolved, he added.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Bosnia's Moslem chairman of the collective presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, said the presidency would review currency design proposals on Wednesday after a meeting of the governors of the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we're going to have to agree on something today because today is the day to reach an agreement with the IMF if we want to see the donors' conference in July,&quot; spokesman Mirza Hajric said.</p>
<p>The design of the interim currency, known as the &quot;convertible mark&quot;, is a sensitive political issue among former wartime foes who celebrate nationalist symbols offensive to their counterparts.</p>
<p>An interim currency was agreed between Serb, Moslems and Croats recently because they could not agree on a permanent solution and the dispute would have delayed the donors' conference indefinitely.</p>
<p>An April agreement in principle brokered by U.S. mediators called for a mutually acceptable design, but did not specifically bar nationalist symbols.</p>
<p>&quot;It is economically wise if the new money has widespread acceptance and unrestricted circulation. This is needed to help economic recovery, build confidence in the financial sector and promote trade,&quot; Zanello said.</p>
<p>Bosnian Serb officials proposed a design that included Orthodox Christian monasteries in Serbia, double-headed eagles and their coat of arms -- all symbols of a four year drive to carve out a separate state in Bosnia, which was curtailed with a peace accord in 1995.</p>
<p>Moslem-Croat federation representatives were proposing a design with flowers and forests without nationalist or religious symbols associated with Bosnian Moslems or Croats, Western officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be very good if there were no nationalistic symbols on the new money,&quot; Hajric said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you want to spread reconciliation and multi-ethnicity, then use a neutral design.&quot;</p>
<p>A decision on design is expected to be made at a presidency session later on Wednesday, where Bosnian Moslem, Croat and Serb leaders are to make a final ruling on a currency that needs to be circulating by October, according to the central bank law.</p>
