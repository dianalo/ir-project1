<p>Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke came top of a non-binding consultation of Conservative party constituency chairmen in England and Wales, according to figures released on Tuesday, ahead of the first ballot of Conservative MPs to choose a new leader.</p>
<p>Clarke polled 269 votes against 178 for ex-Welsh secretary William Hague.</p>
<p>Right-wing Euro-sceptic John Redwood polled 25 votes, ex-social security secretary Peter Lilley got 20 votes and former home secretary Michael Howard came last of the five-man field with 10 votes.</p>
<p>Officials said 87.3 percent of constituency chairmen responded to the telephone poll, which has no official bearing on the selection of the leader to replace former prime minister John Major, who is standing down.</p>
<p>Among Scottish constituency chairmen, Clarke polled 53 votes, Hague 10 and Lilley two. Redwood and Howard got no support.</p>
<p>All 17 Conservative members of the European parliament backed Clarke.</p>
<p>Among Conservative peers, Clarke polled 177 against 45 for Hague, 37 for Lilley, 13 for Redwood and 10 for Howard.</p>
<p>Clarke also topped the ballot of members of the executive committee of the Conservative National Union, the party's voluntary wing, scoring 92 votes.</p>
<p>Hague was second on 45, followed by Lilley on 25, Redwood on 11 and Howard on six.</p>
<p>The results were announced by Sir Archie Hamilton, the chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, which is organising Tuesday's ballot of MPs.</p>
<p>Voting began at 0900 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT, with results released soon after. No candidate is expected to win outright, triggering a second vote next Tuesday.</p>
<p>The results of the consultative poll delighted Clarke's backers, who were already buoyed by an ICM opinion poll in the Guardian showing him the runaway favourite among members of the public.</p>
