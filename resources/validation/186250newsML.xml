<p>A U.S. drill sergeant was discharged and sentenced to confinement on Wednesday after admitting to having sex with three female recruits in the latest sexual misconduct scandal to rock the military.</p>
<p>Staff Sgt. Loren Taylor was given a bad-conduct discharge by a military judge at the Fort Leonard Wood Army base in Missouri. Taylor was also ordered to be confined for five months at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and was demoted to the rank of private after he pleaded guilty to seven charges of misconduct, a court official said.</p>
<p>In addition to admitting to consensual sex with recruits, Taylor said he tried to have sex with a fourth recruit and admitted to having improper contact with another.</p>
<p>Army regulations forbid sexual relationships between commanders and subordinates.</p>
<p>In exchange for his guilty plea, prosecutors agreed to drop charges of obstruction of justice and perjury. Taylor had faced a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison, dishonourable discharge, demotion and loss of pay.</p>
<p>The sentence came a day after the Army disclosed that Taylor and two other noncommissioned officers at Fort Leonard Wood were facing charges ranging from consensual intercourse to indecent assault. Seven other drill sergeants at the base were suspended pending investigations.</p>
<p>The Army said the latest charges resulted from ongoing investigations and were not related to the unfolding rape and sexual harassment scandal at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.</p>
<p>About 25,000 troops train at Fort Leonard Wood each year, making it the second-largest of four posts where the Army conducts basic training.</p>
<p>Unlike the Maryland investigation, none of the Missouri cases involved charges of rape or forcible sodomy. The alleged offences occurred between the summers of 1995 and 1996 and appeared to be unrelated, the Army said.</p>
<p>Last week three male Army trainers were charged in a rape and sexual harassment case involving alleged attacks on women recruits in Maryland. About 20 people were suspended from their duties at the Maryland base pending an investigation.</p>
<p>The military's image has been tarnished in recent years by a string of sexual harassment and misconduct scandals.</p>
