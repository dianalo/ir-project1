<title>SPAIN: Madrid stocks end lower after roller coaster day.</title>
<headline>Madrid stocks end lower after roller coaster day.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-07-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Madrid stocks closed lower on Thursday after a roller coaster ride where thin volumes pushed the market sharply up then down, amid few new factors.</p>
<p>Indices ended lower eyeing Wall Street weakness, dealers said, although they may recoup some ground on Friday. However the tone will likely stay cautious ahead of key U.S. jobs data.</p>
<p>The general index fell 4.01 points, 0.67 percent, to 598.70 and the Ibex shed 57.43 points, 0.84 percent, to 6,810.89.</p>
<p>Iberdrola bucked the trend after its consortium won a bid for Brazilian power distributor Coelba. Shares gained 15 pesetas to 1,725. Endesa, also in the bidding, shed 100 pesetas to 3,200, retracing a climb inspired by six month results.</p>
<p>The outlook remains volatile for the rest of the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;The tone is still erratic and with some underlying weakness, although it seems 6,700 (on the Ibex) is providing firm support,&quot; said one dealer. Participants highlighted the lack of final investors, with business dominated by trading.</p>
<p>&quot;We can safely expect this for the rest of the summer, with no significant moves before September when people are back from their holidays,&quot; said a trader at a foreign brokerage.</p>
