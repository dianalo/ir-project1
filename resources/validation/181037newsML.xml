<p>By Stephen Spencer*</p>
<p>The weekend push by senior National Party figures for a GST only reinforces one of the few certainties in federal politics -- a second Howard government will see Australia finally adopt a broad-based consumption tax.</p>
<p>As Howard's nemesis, Andrew Peacock, was wont to say, it's as sure as night follows day.</p>
<p>Peacock was predicting a GST if Hawke won the 1990 election. He missed on timing and got the wrong political party, but it will happen.</p>
<p>While Howard's solemn promise not to introduce a GST in his first term rules out an overhaul of the tax system before the next election, it's hard to dispute the fact the prime minister has been happy to let the momentum for a GST build to a point where it can no longer be resisted.</p>
<p>Prior to the last election any coalition member who publicly speculated about the benefits of a GST was threatened with disendorsement. Now senior members of the government actively promote the benefits of a broad-based consumption tax with impunity.</p>
<p>Already on the tax cart are the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Business Council, the National Farmers Federation, Taxpayers Association and perhaps most surprisingly the peak welfare body, the Australian Council of Social Service, who see it as a way of increasing the overall tax take.</p>
<p>Now the Nationals, who torpedoed the tax along with the coalition in 1987 and Howard's previous shot at government have joined the ranks of the believers.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the National Party will want it on the agenda for the second term, but we don't want to frighten the horses,&quot; said National Party senate leader Ron Boswell on Sunday.</p>
<p>The National Party conference on Saturday endorsed the need for broad tax reform. A specific call for a GST was only narrowly avoided.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more surprisingly, Labor, which could have expected to make major political capital out of the developing debate, has been surprisingly quiet.</p>
<p>But don't expect to see Howard going into the next election promising to introduce a GST if elected -- the memories of the 1993 debacle are still too fresh in the minds of the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>Instead he will do something similar to Bob Hawke in 1984, who when faced with a similar conviction the tax system was in drastic need of a major overhaul, but loath to speculate about new taxes during an election campaign offered a tax summit.</p>
<p>That summit, as readers might recall, resulted in fringe benefits and capital gains taxes and almost, but not quite, the GST.</p>
<p>While Howard has an aversion to summits, at the very least he will not rule out a GST in the next election, giving himself the option of making tax reform, including a broad-based consumption tax, the major feature of the second Howard government.</p>
<p>As sure as night follows day.</p>
