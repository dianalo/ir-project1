<headline>Thai govt says won't sell rubber in stocks soon.</headline>

<p>Thailand has no plan to unwind government stocks of rubber, which were estimated at around 70,000 tonnes, to the market any time soon, said a senior agriculture ministry on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Sucharit Promdej, an advisor to the agriculture ministry, told Reuters that it was government policy not to dump its stock when prices were on a downward trend.</p>
<p>&quot;We won't do that. It will make the situation worse... If the prices improve to perhaps above 30.00 baht a kg, then it might be a time to sell,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government intervention price now stands at 27.5 baht/kg for unsmoked sheet.</p>
<p>The regional markets had been heading down since Monday after a Thai industry official told a regional gathering of producers on the tourist island of Bali over the weekend that the country had excess stocks of around 140,000 tonnes, half of which were held by the government and the rest by the private sector.</p>
<p>However, trade sources disputed the private sector figure, saying the commercial stock is unlikely to exceed 20,000-30,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Sucharit's remark came amid market rumours that the government had contacted dealers to sell the stock.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no such plan. It won't be right for the government to sell in this situation,&quot; he said.</p>
