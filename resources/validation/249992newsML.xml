<title>USA: NASD fines Arkansas firm for funds sale violations.</title>
<headline>NASD fines Arkansas firm for funds sale violations.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-12-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>NASD Regulation Inc said Tuesday it fined a Little Rock, Ark., brokerage $225,000 for alleged failure to supervise employees in the sale of mutual funds of NationsSecurities Inc, a NationsBank Corp unit.</p>
<p>NASDR, the regulatory unit of the National Association of Securities Dealers, said the firm, Stephens Inc, agreed to pay the penalty without admitting or denying wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In the same action, NASDR also levied a $10,000 fine on Richard Blank Jr, a Stephens broker, and censured him for allegedly failing in his duty to supervise employees involved in mutual fund sales.  </p>
<p>Blank also agreed to the sanction without admitting or denying the NASDR's findings.</p>
<p>An NASDR spokesman said Blank did not have the proper supervisory policies in place. That failure affected the performance of employees involved in the wholesaling of NationsSecurities mutual funds, who were based at NationsBank headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The mutual funds were sold at the retail level in NationsBank branches throughout the southeastern United States by the bank's own employees, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Stephens agreed to hire an independent consultant to review its supervisory procedures and recommend changes to prevent the recurrence of the alleged violations.</p>
<p>NASDR said its investigation of the case was continuing.</p>
