<title>UK: British inflation rises.</title>
<headline>British inflation rises.</headline>

<p>British inflation rose slightly in September, the Office for National Statistics said Thursday, bolstering the Bank of England's call for a rise in interest rates.</p>
<p>The underlying inflation rate, which excludes mortgage interest payments, rose to an annual 2.9 percent last month from 2.8 percent, where it had been stuck for four months.</p>
<p>The headline, or overall, inflation rate was steady at 2.1 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The major upward effects on the 12-month rate came from motoring costs, clothing and footwear prices and from household services' prices,&quot; the ONS said. Clothing and footwear prices jumped a dramatic 5.2 percent from August, the largest monthly rise since records began in 1947.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke has hailed the reduction in inflation as one of the key successes of Conservative economic policy, but the September figures show underlying inflation moving away from his target of 2.5 percent. The Treasury insisted cost pressures in the economy remained subdued, while Clarke said the &quot;feelgood factor&quot; was returning.</p>
<p>However, September price data is the basis on which state social security benefits and pensions will be increased next year, so they will lead to increased public spending, making it harder for Clarke to justify tax cuts in his Nov. 26 budget.</p>
<p>Higher inflation also undermines the Chancellor's case for another cut in interest rates, which would be welcomed by millions of home-owners.</p>
<p>Economists said retailers appeared to have taken advantage of rising turnover to increase profit margins that had been battered by recession earlier in the 1990s.</p>
<p>But Jonathan Loynes, an economist at HSBC Markets, said it was too early to say that a spending spree would fuel retail price inflation. &quot;Consumers are still looking for value for money in the high (shopping) street and the steep drop in factory gate inflation should soon start to feed through into core retail price inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>The central bank, worried that inflation may be set for a resurgence by mid-1998, has been calling since July for official rates to be raised to 6.0 percent from the present 5.75 percent. But Clarke, who as finance minister has the final say on monetary policy, has rejected its advice and economists said it was highly unlikely he would agree to put up interest rates ahead of an election, which is due by May.</p>
