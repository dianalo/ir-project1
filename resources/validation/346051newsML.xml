<p>The Sri Lankan government aims to put the nation's economy -- pounded by soaring defence costs and a crippling energy crisis -- on track for higher growth and a lower budget deficit in 1997, a top Central Bank official said.</p>
<p>R.A. Jayatissa, head of the Central Bank's economic research unit, said on Thursday areas that needed close scrutiny were inflation, gross domestic product (GDP) growth and the balance of payments.</p>
<p>&quot;Our primary target is to achieve sustainable GDP growth of at least seven percent from 1998 onwards, and contain inflation to about six percent,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Towards this end, Sri Lanka must achieve intermediate targets, such as money supply growth of about 16 percent compared to the current 12 percent, and reduce the budget deficit to 7.3 percent of GDP in 1997, he said.</p>
<p>GDP growth is expected to have reached about four percent in 1996, down from 5.5 percent in 1995. The budget deficit is forecast at just below nine percent of GDP last year, compared to 8.4 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>Annualised inflation in 1996 stood at 15.9 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It is more likely that the 1997 budget deficit will be closer to nine percent, and inflation will hover around 10 percent, due to a possible slippage in defence spending and the government being unable to cut its recurrent expenditure by 20 percent as stated in the 1997 budget,&quot; said Mano Tittawella, CEO of Lanka Securities.</p>
<p>Jayatissa also said the ratio of investment to GDP in 1997 must rise to 30 percent from 24.5 percent last year, with the majority coming from the private sector, he said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank says recent budgetary problems were caused mainly by escalating defence costs, wheat subsidies and drought-related power cuts last year.</p>
<p>Defence spending was about nine billion rupees ($158 million) over budget in 1995 and 1996 because of modernisation of the military, which is fighting Tamil Tiger rebels in a civil war that is now in its 14th year.</p>
<p>The rebels are fighting for a separate state in the north and east of the island.</p>
<p>Jayatissa said capital expenditure needs in defence have now been met and he hoped 1997 defence spending could be contained at an estimated 44 billion rupees ($771 million).</p>
<p>Spending on wheat subsidies was cut in 1996 by raising the retail price of a kilo (2.2 lb) of flour by five rupees (nine cents) to 16.95 rupees (30 cents).</p>
<p>The Ceylon Electricity Board, the state-owned monopoly power company, said this month adequate steps had been taken to tide over power demand during the annual January-May drought.</p>
<p>&quot;Considering all this and conservative production estimates for 1997, we do not expect major slippages in the budget,&quot; Jayatissa said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank also believed inflation could be slowed -- despite a recent easing of monetary policy -- because industrial production and agricultural output were expected to rise.</p>
<p>The Central Bank relaxed monetary policy earlier this month by cutting statutory reserves and allowing exporters foreign currency borrowings.</p>
<p>The Central Bank's commitment to low rates is evident from the benchmark one-year Treasury Bill yield, which fell from 19.05 percent in January 1996, to 15.28 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Central Bank also this month cut its overnight repurchase rate to 11.50 percent from 12.75 percent. ($1 = 57.6 rupees)</p>
