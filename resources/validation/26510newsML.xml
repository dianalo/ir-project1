<p>Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani begins a tour of six African states on Monday to boost economic ties in the face of a U.S. campaign to isolate the Islamic republic.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani will visit Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Sudan over a period of up to 12 days, a spokesman at the president's office said.</p>
<p>The tour comes less than a month after U.S. President Bill Clinton tightened sanctions against Iran by signing a law which penalises non-U.S. firms that invest $40 million or more a year in the oil and gas sectors of Iran or Libya.</p>
<p>Tehran intensified its diplomatic activity to woo developing countries by stressing solidarity against the West and offering economic cooperation deals after Washington, which accuses Iran of sponsoring terrorism, imposed trade sanctions in June 1995.</p>
<p>Iran rejects the U.S. charges and says Washington wants to topple its Islamic government for opposing U.S. hegemony.</p>
<p>Africa has figured prominently in Iran's diplomatic drive, with frequent contacts and visits to about 10 African states by senior Iranian delegations in the past month.</p>
<p>&quot;Africa has strategic importance for Iran,&quot; Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Sheikholeslam said during a recent visit to Uganda. &quot;African states have backed Iran on many international issues because they can understand us better than others,&quot; said Sheikholeslam, who also visited Kenya and Sudan.</p>
<p>Tehran has doubled the number of its embassies in Africa to about 23 since its 1979 Islamic revolution and Iranian state radio has launched daily broadcasts in Hausa and Swahili.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani will start his tour in Kenya. He will also visit South Africa which buys up to 65 percent of its oil imports, or about 250,000 barrels per day, from Iran.</p>
<p>Tehran signed a deal with Pretoria last year to store 20 million barrels of its oil in a facility on South Africa's west coast. The project, which has drawn U.S. objections, has been delayed by an environmental impact study but South African officials say they have no political problems with the accord.</p>
<p>Iran's Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh last year offered to undercut Western companies on oil projects in African states. Iran had cooperation ties with South Africa, Kenya, Morocco, Sudan, Tanzania, Libya, Madagascar and Senegal, he said.</p>
<p>Iran is also eyeing African countries for its non-oil exports. It has signed trade deals with several of them and exhibited Iranian products in Kenya and South Africa.</p>
<p>Although the economic results of Iran's drive to woo African and other developing states remain to be seen, Iranian officials have repeatedly expressed satisfaction over most of the nations ignoring U.S. calls to join in a boycott of Tehran.</p>
<p>Some officials have even seen this as a sign of increasing support to Iran in its confrontation with the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Iranian media boasts of international opposition to U.S. policies and interpret it as being supportive to the Islamic republic,&quot; said an Asian diplomat based in Iran.</p>
<p>&quot;As if all of a sudden we all have fallen in love with Iran. I wonder how many top Iranian officials realise the difference between disapproving of extra-territoriality and supporting Iran,&quot; said the diplomat, referring to the U.S. sanctions law.</p>
