<p>Pre-election nerves are hitting British consumer spending and slowing down the economy, the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) said in its quarterly state of the market report.</p>
<p>It said its forecasts for consumer spending growth for 1997 were lower than for 1996 in the three categories of durables, non-durables and services.</p>
<p>&quot;The slowdown in consumer spending is a clear indicator of a weakening in the economy in the run-up to the election,&quot; the Institute's economic adviser Douglas McWilliams said.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though a Labour victory is widely expected, there is still uncertainty about the policies a Labour government might follow.&quot;</p>
<p>However, the CIM said it expected the weakening in the economy to be short-lived, with consumer spending picking up after the election as consumers receive windfalls from the conversion of several building societies into banks.</p>
<p>The CIM's comments followed a weaker than expected CBI distributive trades survey for February last week, which economists said may have reflected pre-election uncertainty.</p>
<p>The institute said the weakening in the economy was not universal and construction appeared to have picked up strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, the outlook is good for business investment, with growth predicted at 4.5 percent this year, rising to 7.4 percent by 1999,&quot; the CIM said.</p>
<p>Exporters faced a gloomy short-term outlook, with margins continuing to be slashed due to the strength of the pound.</p>
<p>But better news could be on the horizon by 1998 as some European economies should start to recover, the CIM said.</p>
