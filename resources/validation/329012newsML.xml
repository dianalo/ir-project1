<p>Germany's economy will post solid growth this year and in 1998 but not enough to bring the unemployment rate below 10 percent, a Reuter survey of leading European economists showed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The survey of 38 economists showed German gross domestic product growth should climb from 1.4 percent in 1996 to 2.2 percent this year and grow by 2.6 percent in 1998.</p>
<p>But even though many of the pre-conditions for faster economic growth are already in place, job growth remains weak, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;The recovery looks like it is taking root,&quot; said Holger Schmieding, economist at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Schmieding and others said the combination of record-low German interest rates, small wage increases, and, maybe most important, the strong dollar, should help lift growth.</p>
<p>The dollar has risen to about 1.62 marks in January from 1.49 marks in late November, prompting views that the rally would help revive the export-driven German economy.</p>
<p>Economists said the dollar was playing a key role since exports have historically been the first leg of economic growth which gets the economic cycle under way, leading to higher investment and more private consumption.</p>
<p>Indeed, some economists believe the first signs of stronger German exports were starting to feed through into the economy as companies show greater willingness to invest.</p>
<p>Economists in the survey said the trade surplus should widen to 112.6 billion marks this year from what they expect will be a surplus of 98.2 billion marks in 1996.</p>
<p>Forecasts for GDP this year ranged from HSBC James Capel UK's 1.6 percent growth to ITEM Club-UK's 2.8 percent forecast.</p>
<p>But the average forecast was below Bonn's prediction for 2.5 percent growth in 1997, which is critical for Germany to whip its finances into shape and cut its budget deficit to qualify for currency union due to start in 1999.</p>
<p>And the stronger growth was also not expected to spill over into labour markets where companies have been reluctant to hire new workers, and provide Germany's expensive benefits, until existing capacity has been exhausted.</p>
<p>Economists said on average that Germany's unemployment rate would remain high at 10.7 percent this year and fall only slightly to 10.1 percent by the 1998 fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Forecasts for unemployment in 1997 ranged from HSBC's 11.8 percent to ITEM Club's 9.9 percent.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate should peak at 10.9 percent in the first quarter of 1997 and shrink to 10.6 percent by the first quarter of 1998.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank should also have ample room to help support growth and trim unemployment without sparking worries about heating up inflation.</p>
<p>The survey showed consumer prices were expected to rise only slightly from 1.5 percent last year to 1.6 percent in 1997 and 1.9 percent next year.</p>
<p>&quot;Manufacturers have little scope for passing on price increases as long as private consumption remains restrained and international competition is keen,&quot; Commerzbank said in a recent commentary.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank was forecast to leave official interest rates unchanged throughout 1997 amid views that the current rate cycle has reached a bottom.</p>
<p>The 2.50 percent discount rate, the floor on German rates, now at a historic low, was seen rising gradually in 1998.</p>
<p>Inflation forecasts ranged between the DIW research institute's 1.2 percent and three banks which saw growth of two percent for the year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, producer prices were forecast to have fallen 0.3 percent in 1996 and to climb only one percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Reflecting expectations for stronger growth, the survey revealed a pickup in industrial production from an expected fall of 0.8 percent in 1996 to 2.7 percent growth for 1997. The current account deficit, meanwhile, which has grown in recent years due to huge capital outflows, was expected to marrow this year to 18.4 billion marks from what was expected to be 26.10 billion marks in 1996.</p>
