<p>Germany coach Berti Vogts has sent a letter to his players berating them for poor performances since they won the European championship last year.</p>
<p>Criticism of the national side has grown louder during their World Cup qualifying campaign during which Germany have looked unimpressive and drawn three of their six games.</p>
<p>&quot;Every national team player has received a letter. It says that I'm totally dissatisfied with the performances after the European championships,&quot; Vogts told Sunday's Welt am Sonntag newspaper.</p>
<p>Vogts also warned  his side would struggle to qualify for the World Cup and to make any impression on the tournament if players did not make enough effort in pre-season training.</p>
<p>He also took a swipe at the huge salaries players now earn and the effect it has on their will to win.</p>
<p>&quot;The national coach has the most difficult job. He has to tell 20 millionaires what to do. And anyone who earns that much money believes he does everything right,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I used to try to explain to every player why he wasn't playing. I don't do that any more because there's no point,&quot; the former Borussia Moenchengaldbach stalwart said. &quot;They believe their so-called friends more than they believe the coach.&quot;</p>
<p>Germany lie second in their World Cup qualifying group, two points behind Ukraine. But Vogts's team still have an excellent chance of winning the group as their opponents have failed to take advantage of their poor performances.</p>
<p>The group leaders have played two games more than Germany and third-placed Portugal are three points behind.</p>
<p>Vogts hinted he would like to move to foreign pastures when his time as national team coach ends. &quot;Maybe I'll take on a completely new challenge -- why not abroad?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the 1970s Moenchengladbach refused to let me go to Ajax. I could have played in the best club side in the world. The feeling that I missed out on something is still there.&quot;</p>
