<p>Chicago White Sox outfielder Tony Phillips was suspended for two games by the American League on Tuesday for an altercation with umpire John Shulock on April 21 in New York.</p>
<p>American League President Gene Budig announced the suspension, saying the penalty was for Phillips' actions leading up to and following his ejection from the game against the New York Yankees.</p>
<p>The suspension was to begin with Wednesday's game against the Texas Rangers in Chicago, the league said. Phillips, however, has exercised his right to appeal and the suspension will be held up, pending the results of a hearing.</p>
<p>&quot;I really did think I did nothing wrong here,&quot; Phillips told a Chicago radio station Tuesday. &quot;I guess I will have my say when I talk to Gene Budig.&quot;</p>
<p>Phillips was ejected by Shulock for arguing balls and strikes during the first inning of a 4-3 loss to the Yankees at Comiskey Park.</p>
<p>Phillips became enraged when Shulock told Yankees pitcher David Cone to pitch before Phillips felt he was ready to bat. Phillips fouled off the pitch, turned and said something to Shulock, who immediately ejected him.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old Phillips is hitting .296 with a homer, four RBI and 14 runs in 23 games this season, his second with the team and 16th in the majors.</p>
<p>He also was suspended for three games in August 1995 for his role in a fight with Boston's Mike Macfarlane.</p>
