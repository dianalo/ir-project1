<p>Shares in Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest ever flotation, are expected to be offered at 30 marks, the very top of the company's estimates, a Reuter survey of UK-based fund managers showed.</p>
<p>Twelve of 15 funds surveyed last week expected the 15-billion marks initial public offering (IPO) at the very top end of the 25-30 mark range estimated by the company on October 21. The other three funds estimated the offer price at 29 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have hoped for a lower price, but I would imagine from the demand and the way the deal has been structured, it will be at the top end of the range,&quot; said Philip Mottram, director at Abtrust Fund Managers.</p>
<p>A marketing extravaganza in Germany has already succeeded in convincing more than three million Germans to sign up for Deutsche Telekom and a 3-1/2 week roadshow, which began on October 22, should also ensure the issue will be well covered.</p>
<p>Seven respondents said they expected the IPO to be three times oversubscribed, with estimates for the cover ranging from two to seven times.</p>
<p>&quot;Institutions want it because it is going to be a big index stock,&quot; said Tony Zucker, head of European equities at Friends Provident Unit Trust Managers.</p>
<p>The German government plans to float about 20 percent of the estimated 75 billion marks total value of Deutsche Telekom, with about 500 million shares sold as part of the global flotation. Banks will have the option to exercise a &quot;greenshoe,&quot; or over-allotment, of 75 million additional shares.</p>
<p>According to Deutsche Telekom, 13-18 percent of the offering will be made in the Americas, 8-12 percent in Britain, 5-8 percent in the rest of Europe and the final 5-8 percent in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Funds expected 40 percent of the total value of the company to be included in Germany's DAX index of 30 leading shares.</p>
<p>That would account for nearly five percent of the Frankfurt index and force funds based on bourse indices to go for the placing, even if fair value is below the offer, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is that the index will reflect more Deutsche shares than are actually freely available, and there will not be enough to go around, creating a natural shortage,&quot; said Jamie Sanderson, head of European equities at Edinburgh Fund Managers.</p>
<p>Contributors' estimates of the fair value ranged from 25-35 marks, with the median at 27 marks.</p>
<p>In the unofficial grey market, provided by brokers prior to an IPO, Deutsche shares were trading about13 percent over the top end of the 25-30 mark range in the week ending October 25.</p>
<p>The final offer price will be set on the weekend of November 15/16, and shares will start trading on German stock exchanges and on the New York Stock Exchange on November 18. In Tokyo, trading will start on November 19.</p>
<p>Some fund managers questioned said that on a yield basis, the share is attractive because the company has promised to pay a dividend of 60 pfennigs per share in 1996/1997 and 1.20 marks per share in 1997/1998.</p>
<p>But Sanderson said &quot;That's only half the story, you've got to look at the potential for the dividend to grow after 1998.&quot;</p>
<p>In January 1998, Germany's telecommunication market will be liberalised and Deutsche Telekom will attempt to maintain market share at the expense of margins, telecom analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Deutsche will tell you that they are already operating in a competitive environment, but only 25 percent of their sales are accrued from it - like mobile phones,&quot; a fund manager said.</p>
<p>Because most of the contributors to the survey requested anonymity, only a summary of the estimates is given below.</p>
