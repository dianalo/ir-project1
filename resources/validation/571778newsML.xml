<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto left for Peru on Friday after apologising for Tokyo's handling of the four-month hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima.</p>
<p>&quot;I am aware of many problematic points. As head of the government, I apologise,&quot; Hashimoto told parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;The incident took place where many guests were invited to celebrate the emperor's birthday. As a result of it, three Peruvians died. I am really sorry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He left on a one-day visit to formally thank Peruvian authorities for their role in the crisis.</p>
<p>Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels took over the Japanese ambassador's home in Lima on December 17 during a lavish reception celebrating the birthday of Emperor Akihito.</p>
<p>The Cuban-inspired rebels took some 500 people hostage and gradually released all but 72.</p>
<p>In a spectacular rescue operation by Peruvian troops on April 22, all but one of the hostages were freed alive. Two soldiers and one hostage died along with all 14 MRTA rebels.</p>
<p>Hashimoto said Japan was partly responsible for lax security which allowed the rebels to storm the building and for the fact that the crisis took so long to end.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the Vienna Convention, Peru as the host country is responsible for security at diplomatic missions,&quot; Hashimoto said. &quot;But in the case of the incident this time, there were many problematic points on the part of Japan in obtaining advance information, ensuring security and handling the crisis.&quot;</p>
<p>During his rush visit to Lima, Hashimoto will meet Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and give his condolences to the bereaved families of the three Peruvians.</p>
<p>On Friday, Japan's parliament donated 4.41 million yen ($36,100) -- 10,000 yen each from 441 Lower House lawmakers -- to Peru's embassy in Tokyo with instructions the funds be passed to the bereaved families of the three men and to rescue workers injured in the raid.</p>
