<p>Thousands of landless Brazilian peasants faced off against landowners in the state of Sao Paulo on Saturday and the situation was &quot;extremely tense,&quot; officials for both sides said.</p>
<p>Leaders of the militant Landless Movement (MST) said 3,000 peasants held a mass gathering in the region of Pontal do Paranapanema, where MST squatters occupying farmland have clashed frequently with estate owners in recent months.</p>
<p>The landowners reacted by holding their own meeting on Saturday morning in protest at the invasions.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is extremely tense but so far there have been no incidents,&quot; said a spokesman for Sao Paulo state governor Mario Covas. &quot;The state government is watching the situation carefully.&quot;</p>
<p>More than 300 military police officers from the region were drafted in to ensure there was no bloodshed, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to show our strength to the land barons,&quot; Jose Rainha Junior, MST leader in Pontal do Paranapanema, told the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. &quot;They have their hired guns and think they can do whatever they want. We want to show them we just want some land to plant.&quot;</p>
<p>Brazil has one of the world's worst distributions of wealth, a fact reflected in land ownership. The Catholic Church says 80 percent of arable land is in the hands of 10 percent of landowners.</p>
<p>A recent acceleration in MST land invasions has led to angry exchanges with the government and also increased tension in the countryside, where so-called &quot;Colonels&quot; who rule like feudal barons frequently react by sending in their hired guns.</p>
<p>Thirty-six people have died so far this year in such conflicts, including 19 landless peasants massacred by police in April in the northern state of Para.</p>
