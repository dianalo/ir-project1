<title>PORTUGAL: Portugal has no comment on Nazi gold for coal deal.</title>
<headline>Portugal has no comment on Nazi gold for coal deal.</headline>
<dateline>LISBON 1996-10-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Bank of Portugal said on Wednesday that it had no comment on reports Portugal acquired looted Nazi gold worth about $1 billion at today's prices during World War Two and tried to use it to buy coal from Poland.</p>
<p>Asked if the Portuguese central bank would launch an investigation, a spokesman said: &quot;We have no comment.&quot;</p>
<p>Previously confidential U.S. documents released on Tuesday said the attempt to use the looted gold to buy Polish coal in the brutal winter of 1946 spurred a furious protest by the United States, Britain and France.</p>
<p>The allies were trying to return the gold to its rightful owners, including treasuries of countries occupied by the Nazis.</p>
<p>The United States believed Lisbon held important amounts of gold from the Dutch and Belgian treasuries and one postwar State Department document complained that Portugal felt under no &quot;obligation to return any German gold.&quot;</p>
<p>Another document, a December 6, 1946 memorandum from the U.S. State Department, said the Portuguese admitted to receiving gold either directly from Germany or through Swiss middlemen acting as major launderers of Nazi assets during the war. ewish Congress, which has been searching the U.S. National Archives to trace Nazi assets, said it had reasons to believe the secret Polish coal deal was completed despite the Allied protests. The documents did not state how much the coal deal was worth.</p>
