<p>Sealy Corp, a Cleveland-based bedding manufacturer, announced on Friday that it had closed on a $275 million credit facility that will allow it to successfully conclude a recapitalization.</p>
<p>The secured revolving credit facility was arranged by BankAmerica Corp's Bank of America</p>
<p>&quot;With the recapitalization concluded, we can now focus all of our energies on strengthening and expanding the business,&quot; stated Ron Jones, Sealy's president and CEO in a written statement.  </p>
<p>Sealy, a privately held company, will use the new credit facility to make a $99.8 million special dividend payment to shareholders as well as to refinance outstanding bank debt, said Ron Stolle, the company's vice president and treasurer.</p>
<p>Stolle declined to specify the amount of bank debt to be refinanced, saying the sum would be disclosed in an upcoming filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>He said the company will also use the borrowing to pay $4 million in consent fees to holders of the company's $200 million senior subordinated notes due 2003.  </p>
<p>Sealy agreed to pay the fees to bondholders on a pro rata basis in exchange for their consents to modify certain provisions in the notes' indenture that would have restricted the company from paying the dividend to shareholders.</p>
<p>To obtain bondholder consents, the company also agreed to increase the coupon on the notes to 10.25 percent from 9.50 percent as well as to raise the notes' call premium.</p>
<p>The company stated it received consents from 99.3 percent of qualifying note holders.</p>
<p>Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's are currently considering downgrading the B1/B-plus ratings on the notes as a result of the recapitalization, according to statements from both rating agencies.</p>
<p>When asked about the current rating agency reviews, Stolle said, &quot;We can't speak for (the agencies), but we are making formal updated presentations to them next week.&quot;</p>
