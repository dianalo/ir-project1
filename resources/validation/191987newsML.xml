<p>A South African task force urged President Nelson Mandela on Friday to help find a political solution instead of sending troops to strife-torn Central Africa, state television reported.</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs director-general Rusty Evans said the team, which included senior military officers sent by Mandela to assess how Pretoria could help in Zaire, had advised against military intervention.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel that there is a need for a political initiative in the Great Lakes area...And we have reported to President Mandela that South Africa should be willing...to contribute to that political diplomatic initiative,&quot; Evans told television news.</p>
<p>He said South Africa should immediately explore the possibility of giving technical assistance, such as a communications network. The delegation also agreed that a trust fund be set up to meet the cost of intervention.</p>
<p>Evans emphasised that the country's participation in the peace process would be guided by the decisions of other African countries.</p>
<p>South African Vice President Thabo Mbeki said earlier on Friday in Belgium his country was not prepared to send troops &quot;to fight a war&quot;. He added that his country would not commit a force until a mandate was agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;We would prefer a relatively limited number of people to be involved,&quot; Mbeki said. &quot;Ideally they should be involved in security and distribution.&quot;</p>
<p>The United Nations is trying to negotiate with Rwanda and Zaire to deploy an international force to help distribute aid to hundreds of thousands of refugees.</p>
<p>Zaire's army is battling Rwandan-backed Tutsi rebels who are pursuing former Hutu soldiers of the Rwanda armed forces mixed with refugees from the 1994 Rwandan civil war.</p>
