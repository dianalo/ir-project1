<p>PSA Peugeot Citroen chairman Jacques Calvet said he hoped to conclude an agreement next month to produce cars in Brazil.</p>
<p>&quot;We've made good progress with several Brazilian states on what incentives they would be willing to offer us. We have another meeting -- and I hope the definitive one -- scheduled for the second half of April. I've asked for precise details on some small points, and it's moving very smoothly,&quot; he told reporters during a presentation over the weekend of the Peugeot 406 coupe.</p>
<p>Calvet said the project would probably involve assembling cars from both the Peugeot and Citroen lines. He said the group may take on Brazilian partners for the project.</p>
<p>Latin America, the Mercosur trading block in particular, are priority zones along with India and Iran for the Peugeot group, which seeks to nearly double the share of sales outside western Europe to 25 percent by the year 2000.</p>
<p>The group is discussing taking a stake in an Argentine plant. Citroen recently inaugurated a plant producing ZX models in Uruguay.</p>
<p>The prospect of a return to the United States remains a possibility, Calvet said. &quot;We still have to find an industrial partner and see when we could put in the financing necessary for a return,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope it'll happen. I don't know if it will,&quot; added Calvet, who is expected to retire in the fall. His idea of a U.S. project would be to return as a producer, not as an exporter as it was in the 1980s, with a model line designed to appeal to the U.S. market.</p>
