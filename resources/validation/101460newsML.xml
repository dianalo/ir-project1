<p>Intellectuals huddled in a corner of a Left Bank cafe, shrouded in cigarette smoke as they fought eager verbal battles over an espresso coffeee, were once as typical a sight of Paris as the Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p>Today, the waiter at the cafe Les Deux Magots can only point to the table at which Jean-Paul Sartre and his post-war existentialist court used to sit.</p>
<p>The most flamboyant Gallic minds have long had their heyday, as confirmed by publication of a &quot;Who's Who&quot; of France's intelligentsia which sounds the death-knell for a figure typical of the capital since the last century.</p>
<p>A hefty 1,250 pages long, the Dictionary of French Intellectuals, out last month, has gratified many who can lay claim to one of its 800 entries and outraged some who have been cast aside.</p>
<p>Les Deux Magots in the chic St Germain-des-Pres district is in, as are the prestigious daily Le Monde, the French Academy founded in 1635, the Arte cultural television channel, Picasso, bishops and the elite Polytechnique School.</p>
<p>The likes of Ernest Hemingway and Henry Miller manage a brief look-in for settling temporarily in Paris.</p>
<p>But most of the thinkers listed in the dictionary are dead, and its authors acknowledge that no one today has the stature of Sartre, his foe Albert Camus, author of the classic &quot;The Outsider&quot;, or the 19th century novelist Emile Zola.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a history book, so it's normal that most of the people are dead rather than alive,&quot; Michel Winock, who edited the dictionary with Jacques Julliard, said in an interview.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;It's true that the great intellectual, on a par with Zola and Sartre, is a near-extinct breed. They owed their reputation to their writings and then they committed themselves politically.</p>
<p>&quot;Today when we talk of intellectuals we talk of people who are politically committed, who are charismatic and are good in front of a television camera but perhaps they don't write great works,&quot; Winock said.</p>
<p>The dictionary's authors have set themselves a narrow definition of the French intellectual -- &quot;a man or woman who brings to the political system a notoriety acquired elsewhere&quot;.</p>
<p>On that count, he or she is alive and kicking.</p>
<p>Philosopher Alain Finkielkraut has denounced the award-winning film &quot;Underground&quot; by Bosnian Moslem director Emir Kusturica as Serb propaganda, and writer Bernard Henri-Levy has travelled to Sarajevo and brought back a documentary on the siege of the Bosnian capital.</p>
<p>This summer, cancer specialist Leon Schwartzenberg joined African hunger-strikers holed up in a Paris church to protest at expulsion orders.</p>
<p>&quot;French intellectuals have always engaged in political combat. That goes back to the turn of the century and the Dreyfus case, when (then-journalist) Georges Clemenceau called those who had mobilised for the Jewish army officer &quot;intellectuals,'&quot; Winock said.</p>
<p>The case, a notorious miscarriage of justice in which the officer was framed on spying charges and sentenced to solitary confinement in the Devil's Island penal colony, divided French families in a web of anti-semitism and national pride.</p>
<p>Later, intellectuals crossed swords over appeasement on the eve of the Second World War, on resistance or collaboration during the war and on independence for France's colony Algeria.</p>
<p>Years later, the intelligentsia are still licking their wounds after the long Cold War tussle between the leftist Sartre and Camus, whose study of revolutionary ideals corrupted by murder and oppression in &quot;The Rebel&quot; broke his ties to Sartre.</p>
<p>Asked whether he considered himself an intellectual, Finkielkraut said he did his utmost not to fall into the trap of &quot;perpetual protest&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;What people today demand of an intellectual is never that he be intelligent, but that he cries out at every catastrophe, at every scandal, at every painful event. People expect denunciation from him, not interpretation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Critics pointed out that there was no entry on feminist publishers and denounced the inclusion of revisionist historian Roger Garaudy.</p>
<p>The conservative newspaper Le Figaro castigated the dictionary's authors for putting too much emphasis on an intellectual's political stand.</p>
<p>&quot;People mustn't fall into the trap of preferring morality to talent or creation, even if some would like to have it that way,&quot; wrote the daily's literary editor Jean-Marie Rouart.</p>
<p>&quot;Voltaire was generous in his defence of liberty, all to the good. But that wasn't what constituted his genius. Baudelaire and Mallarme kept such concerns at a distance. Should we criticise such eminently intellectual geniuses for the fact that they fit so poorly with our concept of an intellectual?&quot; he asked.</p>
