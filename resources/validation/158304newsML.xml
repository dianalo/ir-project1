<title>NEW ZEALAND: RESEARCH ALERT - Capel bullish on Fletcher Energy.</title>
<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Capel bullish on Fletcher Energy.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-10-31</dateline>

<p>HSBC James Capel senior energy analyst Mario Traviati said on Thursday the brokerage had lifted its earnings estimate on Fletcher Energy.</p>
<p>He told Reuters that Capel had lifted its recommendation on the stock to buy just over a month ago.</p>
<p>Wellington brokers said a bullish report from Capel partly accounted for the 22 cent rise to NZ$4.03 in Fletcher Energy's share price on Thursday.</p>
<p>Traviati declined to release the report or details of the earnings upgrade. He raised the earnings estimate after Fletcher's quarterly report published on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>In the quarterly report Fletcher Energy said total production for the September quarter was 12.5 million barrels of oil equivalent, up 11.0 percent on the same period in the 1995/96 year.</p>
<p>&quot;If you compare Fletcher to the rest of the energy or oil and gas sector they are good value,&quot; Traviati said. &quot;The earnings arithmetic on the company is very, very good. It was a good quarterly result and they have some good exploration wells coming up.&quot;  </p>
<p>He said that on a cashflow multiple, Fletcher Energy stacked up as one of the cheapest stocks in the sector in Australasia or even globally.</p>
<p>Fletcher had some good wells on the exploration front. He singled out the Rahi well, near the Maui field offshore from the west coast of the North Island, as a particularly promising prospect.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday Fletcher Challenge Chief Executive Hugh Fletcher told shareholders that the Maui B oil project would produce oil worth NZ$570 million and add $100 million to Fletcher Energy's cashflow this year.  </p>
<p>Fletcher said the oil project will generate cash flow before interest of around $260 million.</p>
