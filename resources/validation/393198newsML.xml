<p>Fans will be caged in at the World Cup finals next year -- contrary to FIFA hopes.</p>
<p>&quot;I have come to the conclusion that we can't consider removing the fences for the World Cup,&quot; France's Interior Minster Jean-Louis Debre said.</p>
<p>&quot;We might be able to do this in some years' time if the teaching progresses, if mentalities change. Today, we're not ready, so there will be fences,&quot; Debre was quoted as saying in Friday's L'Equipe.</p>
<p>Debre, who called himself Mr Security of the World Cup, said the safety of people at the finals, &quot;which must be a festival&quot;, could in no way be compromised.</p>
<p>FIFA president Joao Havelange advocates the removal of fences and no doubt hoped to hear this would be the case from French President Jacques Chirac when the two meet in Rio in March.</p>
<p>Nine of the 10 grounds being prepared for the finals, all used by first or second division clubs, have fencing. Debre said fencing would also be erected at the new Stade de France national stadium being built in Paris.</p>
<p>FIFA general secretary Sepp Blatter said: &quot;We won't make a state issue of it. It was our wish to see fences abolished for the World Cup. If the French government decides otherwise, we will bend (in favour)...there will still be football.&quot;</p>
<p>France's World Cup organising Committee CFO, of which former national team captain Michel Platini is co-president, issued a statement backing the decision to retain fences.</p>
<p>&quot;The CFO has always considered that the decision to do away with or maintain the fences in the stadiums could only be taken in complete accord with all those responsible for public security and French football, within the framework of a policy valid not only during but also after the World Cup,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Since it appears the fences cannot be done away with from 1998 without risk, the status quo prevails and the World Cup stadiums will be prepared under the guidelines of the FFF's (French Football Federation) regulations governing grounds...which includes the presence of fences.&quot;</p>
<p>Debre said France lagged behind Britain in legislation governing security at football grounds and wanted to see soccer related offences committed outside grounds punished with the same severity as those committed inside.</p>
<p>He also said that there would be a strong police presence outside grounds, but minimal inside -- with fast back-up available.</p>
<p>Debre said about 5,000 officers, including gendarmes and riot police, would be mobilised at the venues.</p>
<p>&quot;They will be employed according to the importance of the matches and the sensitive character of certain teams,&quot; he said.</p>
