<p>Five truck drivers were hurt on Monday night after a fire broke out in a truck being transported on a train through the Channel Tunnel from Britain to France.</p>
<p>&quot;The five men have been taken to hospital,&quot; a spokesman for channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel told Reuters. &quot;The train is still on fire. It is being tackled by both the French and British fire fighting services,&quot; the spokeswoman added.</p>
<p>The 35 mile long (51 km) tunnnel linking England and France was closed after the freight-shuttle train, used to transport trucks and their drivers, was evacuated just after 9 p.m. (same GMT) with the carriages around 12 miles (19 km) from the French end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>The fire broke out toward the back of the 730 metre (yard) long train, which can carry up to 28 large trucks, the Eurotunnel spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the first time the tunnel has been closed for an emergency. We have had safety drills in the past but this is the first real event,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Thirty one passengers were evacuated from the northbound tunnel to a central service shaft and then transported via another shuttle train back to France via the southbound tunnel.</p>
<p>Three of the injured truck drivers were taken to a hospital in Calais and the other two were in hospital in Lille, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel said they did not know when the tunnel would be opened for passenger traffic. &quot;We do not know exactly what damage has been caused because the firefighters are still dealing with it,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Both the French and the Kent(British) fire services they are making steady progress fighting the fire but it is not completely out yet,&quot; she said.</p>
