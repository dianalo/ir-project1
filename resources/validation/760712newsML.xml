<title>UK: Nasdaq seeks co-operation with London Exchange.</title>
<headline>Nasdaq seeks co-operation with London Exchange.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. high-tech stock market Nasdaq on Monday said it had begun an initiative to seek co-operation opportunities with the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and other bourses in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Nasdaq chairman Frank Zarb said there were huge opportunities for stock markets to work together to regulate markets and exchange information but denied Nasdaq's main aim was to poach business from its rivals.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not trying to find an edge here,&quot; he said, &quot;we are anxious to co-operate with major financial institutions around the world...it is not an issue of confrontation.&quot;</p>
<p>However Zarb restated Nasdaq's global ambitions</p>
<p>&quot;We aim to be the market of choice for (new) issues and investors worldwide,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At the start of tour to speak with five European bourses and one in Asia, Zarb said in London he planned to meet with officials from the LSE and the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the UK financial industry watchdog.</p>
<p>Both UK institutions are in the process of radical change. The LSE is about to abandon its current &quot;market-maker&quot; system, where dealers set prices and agree trades by phone, in favour of an &quot;order-driven&quot; system where trades are matched automatically by computer.</p>
<p>The SIB's role is being expanded to take over responsibilities from three self-regulatory organisations in a process intended to tighten up supervision and co-ordinate policies.</p>
<p>Yet Zarb was non-committal on the likely impact of changes at both organisations.</p>
<p>&quot;I am here to learn,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Buoyed by the success of the likes of Microsoft and Intel -- both in the top five of U.S. companies in terms of market value -- Nasdaq reckons to be the biggest stock market in the world in terms of number of listed companies and volume of shares traded per day.</p>
<p>Zarb said the New York Stock Exchange had recently indicated that it might drop its rule 500, which forbids companies from abandoning a listing on the NYSE, adding that this could foster competition between exchanges from which Nasdaq could potentially benefit.</p>
<p>&quot;We open on time even on volatile days,&quot; he said, &quot;there are</p>
