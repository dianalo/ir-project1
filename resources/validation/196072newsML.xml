<p>Cigarette lighters distributed among Moslem refugees living in some former front- line communities in northeastern Bosnia carry the slogan: &quot;No home like your home, no river like the Drina&quot;.</p>
<p>Part exhortation, part lament, the simple line speaks volumes about the yearning among those refugees to return to homes in Serb-held eastern Bosnia from which they fled or were driven during the war.</p>
<p>Understandable in human terms, the Moslem desire to repopulate eastern Bosnia as far as the banks of the Drina, Bosnia's border with Yugoslavia, rattles Serbs who fought a ferocious war to drive them out.</p>
<p>NATO officers and U.N. officials agree the issue is so explosive it could undermine the entire Dayton peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;The war really won't be over for many of these refugees unless and until they get back to their homes,&quot; said a NATO officer who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;Dayton could falter on the issue of refugee returns. It could be the turning point between peace and war.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dayton accord, which brought an end to the 43-month Bosnian war a year ago, promised the country's 2.5 million Moslem, Serb and Croat refugees and displaced persons a &quot;phased and orderly&quot; return to their homes.</p>
<p>Perhaps 250,000 have gone back since, but few if any have crossed the Inter-Entity Boundary Line (IEBL) which Dayton drew between Moslem-Croat and Serb territory inside Bosnia.</p>
<p>The IEBL was supposed to be an administrative boundary but Serbs insist their 49 per cent of Bosnia is sovereign and the country seems well on its way to de facto partition.</p>
<p>Even in Bosnia's narrow, 1,000 km long (620 mile) Zone of Separation (ZOS), where NATO rules supreme, refugee returns were suspended last week after fighting broke out between Moslems and Serbs in the village of Gajevi.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue is political. We are faced with a brick wall of hostility on the issue of returnees on the Serb side,&quot; said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the Sarajevo office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
<p>&quot;The only area where there are any returns is the ZOS and that's because Serb influence there is limited or non-existent. The issue of security is vital. If the ZOS is under-policed it could turn into a kind of skirmish belt, a Beirut if you will.&quot;</p>
<p>International officials say the running battles around Gajevi last week were provoked by returning Moslems.</p>
<p>But officials admit the Moslems acted partly in response to Serbs systematically dynamiting and mining hundreds of homes to which Moslem refugees were preparing to return across the ZOS over the past six weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of Moslem refugees who have been living desperate lives for the past three or four years,&quot; explained Alex Ivanko, a spokesman for the U.N. police force in Bosnia.</p>
<p>&quot;We may see more and more of them making a run for it, trying to resettle empty villages in the ZOS. That's why the Serb tactic is to destroy those villages, which only makes the refugees more anxious.&quot;</p>
<p>Winter weather will soon put the refugee return problem on hold until spring, but by then the die may be cast.</p>
<p>Presidents and prime ministers are already recasting the international community's 1997 mandate and mission in Bosnia.</p>
<p>Observers detect little enthusiasm for an aggressive effort on refugee returns, which troubles some NATO officers.</p>
<p>&quot;If we were sent here to freeze-frame the situation then I believe we have achieved our mission and it is called partition,&quot; said a senior NATO officer.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot continue along the path we are going. We are at the point of impasse now, the point where to get people to comply (with Dayton on refugee returns) we have to get tougher and tougher, as you saw in Gajevi last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the concern about (NATO) casualties there is hesitancy. But there can be no resettlement without security provided by the international community and to remain on the current course is to head for failure.&quot;</p>
