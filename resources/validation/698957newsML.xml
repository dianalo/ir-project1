<headline>Dlr ends higher vs mark, flat vs yen in quiet US.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The dollar closed modestly higher against the mark and little changed versus the yen on Tuesday after sticking to extremely narrow ranges throughout the U.S. session.</p>
<p>Dealers said that caution ahead of Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting outcome and Thursday's June employment report was behind the muted activity.</p>
<p>But they were encouraged by the dollar's ability to end on a strong note and hold near a 40-month peak against the mark -- set during the European session -- throughout much of the day.</p>
<p>&quot;In general the dollar remains very well bid,&quot; said Marc Chandler, senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>&quot;We firmed back up toward the highs on the back of late comments from Bundesbank President Tietmeyer.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar ended the New York session at 1.7468/73 marks, up from 1.7455/60 at the open. It ended flat at 114.90/95 yen against 114.90/00 at the outset of trading.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer, speaking in Frankfurt on Tuesday, said he preferred to think of the dollar as strong rather than the mark as weak.</p>
<p>His comments, along with remarks from U.S. Deputy Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers, who said he believed the dollar was &quot;in a very strong position,&quot; allowed the dollar to stage a modest late afternoon rally.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the dollar had fallen below the 1.74 mark threshold in sympathy with a slump in sterling. After pushing to a fresh five year high against the mark, the pound succumbed to a heavy bout of profit-taking, which took it down from a high of 2.91 marks to a low of 2.8834.</p>
<p>Jitters ahead of the unveiling of the British Labor government's first budget on Wednesday and news of a drop in Britain's June purchasing managers' index contributed to sterling's drop.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, dealers said that expectations of higher interest rates in Britain should keep the pound well supported.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the budget out on Wednesday and there was clearly some interest to take some profits,&quot; said John McCarthy, senior vice president at ING Barings Capital Markets.</p>
<p>&quot;But sterling is still well underpinned and I think it will resume its climb,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Weighing mildly on the dollar on Tuesday was a modest drop in the National Association of Purchasing Management's June index, which registered 55.7 against 57.1 in May.</p>
<p>Strong regional purchasing managers reports on Monday had fuelled expectations of a more robust national report and rekindled talk of an August Fed tightening.</p>
<p>The dollar was resilient, however, and drifted near the top of its recent ranges by the close of trading.</p>
<p>Dealers said tough resistance lurks above 1.75 marks, but predicted a hurdle of this barrier should Thursday's payrolls report come in at the high end of expectations. They foresaw little damage on Wednesday if the Fed, as expected, holds interest rates steady.</p>
<p>In other trade on Tuesday, the dollar rose to 1.4662/67 Swiss francs from an opening rate of 1.4630/40 and edged down to Canadian $1.3794/99 from C$1.3800/10.</p>
<p>The British pound ended weaker at $1.6585/90 versus $1.6635/45, while the Australian dollar fell to $0.7510/15 from $0.7520/25.</p>
