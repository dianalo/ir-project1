<p>Switzerland's Michael von Gruenigen, racing more aggressively than ever, clinched his first World Cup Alpine skiing win of the season on Sunday in Alta Badia's daunting giant slalom.</p>
<p>The World Cup giant slalom champion, cheered on by his family at the finish, clocked an official combined time of two minutes 32.66 seconds to lead home a Swiss one-two with compatriot Steve Locher in second place.</p>
<p>Locher, winner of the opening giant slalom of the season in Soelden, Austria, in October, clocked 2:33.43 ahead of Italian newcomer Matteo Nana who was third in 2:34.15.</p>
<p>The top three after the 55 gate second leg down the Gran Risa piste were unchanged from the leaders at the end of the 56 gate first leg, with Von Gruenigen the fastest in both.</p>
<p>Von Gruenigen leads the giant slalom World Cup standings with 280 points, ahead of Austrian Hans Knauss on 240.</p>
<p>&quot;That was maybe one of the most aggressive races of my career,&quot; said Von Gruenigen, who had never won here before and has now notched up eight World Cup wins.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I had to take more risks today than ever,&quot; added the moustachioed Swiss, who had cast a wary eye at Locher's impressively quick times in pre-race training.</p>
<p>&quot;This is one of my greatest victories. Its always important to make sure of the first win but when it is here in Alta Badia it is even more important,&quot; Von Gruenigen said.</p>
<p>The Gran Risa piste is perhaps the most demanding giant slalom of any on the men's circuit.</p>
<p>The result reversed the top two placings from Soelden when Von Gruenigen, who has had a slow start to the season after dominating last year's races, finished behind Locher.</p>
<p>Locher, who has drawn a blank since his opening victory, was just happy to be back on the podium again.</p>
<p>&quot;To be second behind Von Gruenigen on this course is about as good as a win,&quot; said the Swiss Olympic combined bronze medallist, who won his first giant slalom here in 1993.</p>
<p>He said that he had problems in the races in the United States with the artificial snow there.</p>
<p>The third place was the first ever podium finish for Nana and gave the Italian crowd something to sing about in the absence of world champion Alberto Tomba, who decided to stick to his pre-arranged training schedule rather than race.</p>
<p>Alta Badia was also the resort where triple Olympic gold medallist Tomba, who returned from pre-season injury with second place in a slalom at Madonna di Campiglio on Tuesday, clinched his first ever World Cup podium 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Since 1986, Tomba had finished on the podium in every year Alta Badia had staged a race -- he has won here four times altogether -- and 22-year-old Nana made sure that an Italian would again be stepping up in front of the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;To do it here in front of this crowd and on this course is like a dream,&quot; said Nana, who was 10th in Tuesday's slalom and who was second fastest in Sunday's second leg. &quot;With all the pressure and the fans, it's an incredible result.&quot;</p>
<p>Knauss made sure he retained the overall World Cup lead through Christmas by finishing fourth.</p>
<p>Compatriot Thomas Sykora, who had been is closest rival befoe the race, skied out on the first leg. Knauss now has 421 points, with Von Gruenigen second on 331.</p>
<p>&quot;I was too tired to ski at my best,&quot; said Knauss who nonetheless was third fastest in the second leg. &quot;I don't want to think about the overall World Cup yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Sunday's race was the last before the Christmas holiday break. The men's World Cup circuit renews with a downhill at the Italian resort of Bormio on December 29.</p>
