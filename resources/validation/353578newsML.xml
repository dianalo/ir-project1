<p>Canadian Agriculture Minister Ralph Goodale said on Tuesday he would have to rely mainly on his powers of persuasion to convince Canada's rail companies to move more grain more quickly.</p>
<p>He was reacting to a request by the Canadian Wheat Board to intervene in a situation where delayed rail shipments of grain led to more than 34 ships waiting to load on the Pacific, possibly causing demurrage fees of C$15 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The options for direct intervention are certainly limited,&quot; Goodale told Reuters.  </p>
<p>&quot;I have already had conversations with railway representatives and I intend to continue to pursue that...I want to follow those up to see what they're prepared to do to alleviate the situation in the shortest time period possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if legislation could be introduced to rectify the situation if it persisted, he said he would be willing to take a look at it. But he said these options were limited and that he would have to discuss it with cabinet colleagues before making any detailed comment.</p>
<p>The main problem, he said, was the need for more locomotive power.  </p>
<p>He said a factor in the delays was cold and snow, but that every Canadian January had such conditions and that the CWB thought there was a problem in the system.</p>
