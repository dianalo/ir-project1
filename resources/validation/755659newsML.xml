<headline>Low inflation, US growth can co-exist - Fed's Stern.</headline>

<p>The U.S. economy has done and is continuing to do well, and a large amount of evidence suggests that modest inflation and prolonged economic growth can co-exit, said the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Gary Stern.</p>
<p>&quot;Causality is difficult to demonstrate in economics,&quot; Stern told an American Farm Bureau conference in Red Wing, Minnesota. &quot;But we nevertheless seem to be building a considerable body of evidence which suggests that, at least in the United States, modest inflation and prolongued periods of growth go hand in hand,&quot; Stern added.  </p>
<p>A copy of Stern's speech was made available in New York.</p>
<p>The Minneapolis Fed president outlined three key factors which, although not all inclusive, have contributed to sustained growth in the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>They were technology, trade and government policy.</p>
<p>Stern elaborated on each of them, saying that improvements in the state of technology was a key factor determining economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;In short, technological progress raises labor productivity, which in turn raises growth,&quot; Stern said.</p>
<p>On foreign trade, the Minneapolis Fed chief said that international commerce &quot;is positive for economic growth because of its implications for technological progress and labor productivity.&quot;</p>
<p>Explaining how government policy can foster and contribute to sustained economic growth, Stern said that progressive steps taken in recent years towards balancing the federal budget have been positive, &quot;largely, I suspect, through their favorable implications for business capital investment.&quot;</p>
<p>Stern also praised the Fed's monetary policy as a contributor to the &quot;favorable performance of the economy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is agreement that the supply of money is determined by the central bank in the long run. Thus, with (a) policy which limits money creation appropriately, the Federal Reserve can in fact achieve and maintain low inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>On the cautious side, Stern said that anecdotal evidence also testified to the strength of the expansion.</p>
<p>&quot;In meetings with business and other community leaders, we are told constantly of severe labor shortages, of renewed strength in commercial construction activity, and, is some locations, of very tight housing markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy is currently in its seventh consecutive year of expansion.</p>
