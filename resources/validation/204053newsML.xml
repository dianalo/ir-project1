<text>
<p>Cyprus stocks registered losses on Wednesday in sluggish mid-week trading, traders said.</p>
<p>The 41-share Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE) index, set at 100 points, closed at 82.40 points on Wednesday, a decline of 0.74 percent from Friday's close of 83.02.</p>
<p>Declines were recorded in all but one of the seven sub indices, that of insurance companies.</p>
<p>&quot;We have just gone through a month with the highest call on new money which pulled around 15 million pounds ($32.77 million) from the market,&quot; said Nicos Severis, chairman of Sigma-Severis and Athientis Ltd in Nicosia.</p>
<p>&quot;But overall, it is something called lack of interest,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It will take an event, I don't know what, to bring it back up. There is need for new blood in the market, although we only need two or three institutional investors to create a momentum,&quot; said Severis.</p>
<p>The banking sub index, the strongest on the market, closed at 91.24 points on Wednesday, slightly lower than 91.71 it closed at on Friday.</p>
<p>Fully paid shares in the Bank of Cyprus closed at 341.5, down two cents from 343.5 on Friday. Fully paid of the Cyprus Popular Bank closed on Wednesday at 328.5, down 1.5 cents on 330.5 it closed at on Friday.</p>
<p>The third largest bank, the Hellenic Bank closed at 261.5 from 265.5 on Friday and the newly-created Universal Savings Bank closed at 135, down one cent from Friday.</p>
<p>Trading in insurance companies was mixed. Its index went up to 76.01 from 75.84 on Friday. Shares in Universal Life UNII.CY closed at 382.5 from 384 on Friday. Paneuropean Insurance fully paid closed at 133, down half a cent from Friday.</p>
<p>Interamerican Insurance closed unchanged at 103, while associate company Philiki Insurance closed at 244, up 5.5 cents from Friday.</p>
<p>The index in industrial companies closed at 81.43, down 20 basis points from Friday. Cement producer Vassiliko closed Wednesday at 153.5, down one cent on Friday's close.</p>
<p>Keo, the Cypriot beer and wine producer, closed at 108.5 from 109 on Friday.</p>
<p>National carrier Cyprus Airways was trading at 40.7 cents on Wednesday over last Friday's 41 cents.</p>
