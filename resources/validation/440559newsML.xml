<p>A British Labour government would cut basis state pensions and means test all pensioners, Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley said on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said Labour would effectively cut the basic pension by 20 pounds per week by allowing people to retire at the age of 60 but refusing to spend the extra 15 billion pounds it would cost to give people a full pension then, rather than at 65.</p>
<p>&quot;Price erosion, a cut, a new means test. New Labour's policies threaten pensioners,&quot; Lilley told a news conference.</p>
<p>Lilley said a Labour government may not protect the state pension against inflation. &quot;And Labour plans to test all pensioners to see whether they are eligible for the pension entitlement.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that the government's planned shake-up of old age pensions -- Basic Pension Plus -- would probably double the level of pensions currently received.</p>
<p>Under the scheme people would have their own pension fund, into which a proportion of their national insurance contributions would be paid. The fund would invest the pooled proceeds in the financial markets and the government would put a floor under the scheme by guaranteeing that no-one receives less than the basic pension uprated for inflation.</p>
<p>Lilley said the stock market had yielded 7.7 percent more than inflation each year on average over the past 50 years.</p>
<p>&quot;On that basis, Basic Pension Plus should produce pensions double the size currently,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The pensions debate will continue in parliament on Thursday afternoon as the two major parties square up again ahead of elections, which are expected to be called for May 1.</p>
<p>With Labour 20 points and more ahead in the opinion polls, a change of government seems likely.</p>
