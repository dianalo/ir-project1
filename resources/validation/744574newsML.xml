<p>Lithuanian brewer Utenos said on Monday its shareholders would decide on investment offers from Carlsberg and Baltic Beverage Holdings, owned by Finnish Hartwall and Norway's Orkla.</p>
<p>The group also confirmed a report in the Verslo Zinios business newspaper that Carlsberg has offered to invest 81 million litas in the company.</p>
<p>BBH has offered 50 million litas in investments and said it would pay 300 litas per share.</p>
<p>&quot;Our shareholders will discuss the Carlsberg and BBH offers at a meeting today,&quot; brewery general director Stasys Krasauskas told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting may last up to four hours and at this stage it is impossible to say how the shareholders will choose as around 80 percent of shares are held by individual investors,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Utenos has also been arguing with the state for several years over the size of the government's stake in the company.</p>
<p>Utenos says the state has 21.5 percent of the firm while the state says it may own as much as 35.6 percent.</p>
<p>BBH already dominates the Baltic beer market, controlling the leading brewers in all three Baltic states.</p>
