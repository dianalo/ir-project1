<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss analysts see UBS move as positive.</title>
<headline>Swiss analysts see UBS move as positive.</headline>

<p>Swiss bank analysts attending a briefing by Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) after the bank announced a major domestic restructuring on Tuesday morning said the latest measures should be generally positive.</p>
<p>Hans Kaufmann, analyst at Bank Baer, speaking to reporters after the meeting with UBS chief executive Mathis Cabiallavetta, said he was raising his estimate for UBS's net profit from 1997 onwards, in view of the restructuring measures.</p>
<p>UBS announced that it would take a one-time charge of 3.0 billion Swiss francs to cover a credit restructuring, and also said it would reduce its domestic workforce by about 800.</p>
<p>The restructuring of its loan portfolio and the moves to cut domestic staff are similar to those announced by the other two big Swiss banks, CS Holding and its financial arm Credit Suisse, and Swiss Bank Corp (SBC).</p>
<p>But the job cuts at UBS are less sweeping.</p>
<p>Analysts said that UBS had had fewer acquisitions than the other banks in the past, and thus might have had less need to cut jobs.</p>
<p>The latest news met with a mixed reaction outside Switzerland. Standard &amp; Poor's said it was putting UBS on its creditwatch list, saying the news of significant provisions reflected &quot;continued asset quality problems in the bank's domestic operations.&quot;</p>
<p>But Baer's Kaufmann was optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;Net profit should be in the area of 2.6 billion to 2.7 billion Swiss francs next year,&quot; Kaufmann said.</p>
<p>He said he had previously estimated 1997 net at 2.4 billion francs before the new measures were announced.</p>
<p>Kaufmann said he expected 1998 net profit to be around 3.0 billion francs.</p>
<p>&quot;We still have UBS classed as a &quot;hold&quot;. But you could say we are close to making a change,&quot; Kaufmann said. He said Bank Baer would consider raising UBS to a &quot;buy&quot; due to the restructuring.</p>
<p>Bank Baer currently has SBC as its only &quot;buy&quot; recommendation among the big three Swiss banks.</p>
<p>UBS also forecast with Tuesday's announcement that it was aiming for a Return On Equity (ROE) of 12 percent by 1999.</p>
<p>Kaufmann said the ROE goal appeared realistic.</p>
<p>He said analysts were told in the meeting with Cabiallavetta that UBS also expected a medium-term ROE in Swiss domestic credit business of 10 percent.</p>
<p>He did not say what the current domestic credit ROE was.</p>
<p>Andre Meier, analyst at Swiss Volksbank, who also attended the meeting, agreed that an ROE goal of 12 percent seemed realistic. He also welcomed the one-time charge, saying it should creating more transparency in UBS's credit portfolio.</p>
<p>&quot;Up till now, it has been very difficult for analysts to predict the level of credit risk (at UBS),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Meier said he was not sure yet whether he would raise net profit estimates for UBS for 1997 and beyond.</p>
<p>He expected the world economic environment to have more of an impact on 1997 earnings than the domestic measures.</p>
<p>Meier said he would also consider whether to upgrade UBS from a current level of underperform, based on the restructuring.</p>
