<p>The Kenyan shilling eased marginally against the dollar on Tuesday in range-bound trading and central bank officials said they expected it to appreciate.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) posted a shilling mean rate of 54.93 against the dollar versus 54.94 on Monday, while versus the pound, it was posted at a mean rate of 88.57 from 89.43.</p>
<p>&quot;The shilling is currently strong and we expect this strength to continue,&quot; said CBK Chief Economist Maurice Kanga.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, the shilling is threatening to appreciate further,&quot; Kanga told a news briefing in Nairobi.</p>
<p>The central bank said in a separate statement that the large shilling exchange rate movements associated with the major economic reforms of 1993 to 1994 were unlikely to be repeated.</p>
<p>At the height of financial chaos in Kenya in October 1994, the shilling traded at 83 versus the dollar.</p>
<p>Dealers have said that central bank interventions in recent weeks stopped the shilling from further gains, but the central bank said: &quot;The shilling exchange rate will be left to be determined by the market forces.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the shilling eased slightly on Tuesday on modest dollar inflows from exporters amid subdued demand.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever little demand there is has been spread over, so it's not coming in large enough quantities to upset the market,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>They added that in the absence of fresh factors to move the market, the shilling would remain stable as trade was well-balanced.</p>
<p>&quot;A stable shilling is in line with the central bank's objective to create a healthy investment climate boosted by a stable unit,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors can actually plan for the long term with a stable shilling,&quot; a financial analyst said.</p>
<p>Local money market funding of a 1.25 billion shillings deficit from the treasury bill auction last week, pushed overnight rates up marginally.</p>
<p>The rates were quoted between 10-15 percent compared to below 10 percent on Monday.</p>
