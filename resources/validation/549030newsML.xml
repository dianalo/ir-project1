<p>Following are some of the leading stories in the Swedish papers on Tuesday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>DAGENS NYHETER</p>
<p>- Protests are growing against cut backs of the country's health care system. Many areas have lost emergency care facilities or maternity wards.</p>
<p>- U.S. analysts fuelled a plunge in the share price of telecoms group Ericsson on Monday.</p>
<p>- Engineering group Atlas Copco  reported an improved first quarter result because of favourable currency effects, above all in the dollar, and some improved volumes.</p>
<p>- The forestry industry still is still not strong, as forestry group SCA showed in its first quarter result. The profit, 894 million crowns versus 1.01 billion in the same period a year earlier, was somewhat lower than expectations.</p>
<p>SVENSKA DAGBLADET</p>
<p>- The billions of crowns in profit Swedish telecoms group Ericsson posted for the first quarter of 1997 were not enough and the share plunged five percent at the opening of the Stockholm Stock Exchange on Monday.</p>
<p>The fall in the share, which accounts for 15 percent of the bourse's total market capitalisation, set the tone for the day.</p>
<p>- Forestry company SCA is reporting good sales overall. But poor sales in two divisions -- wood-containing printing papers and corrugated board -- brought the first quarter result down.</p>
<p>- The management of Swedish power company Sydkraft said it believes both the nuclear reactors at the Barseback nuclear plant, which are scheduled to be closed, will be producing electricity long after elections next year.</p>
<p>- Carbon dioxide emission in Denmark rose 23 percent last year entirely because of increased carbon based electricity exports to Sweden and Norway.</p>
<p>DAGENS INDUSTRI</p>
<p>- The head of Swedish utility company Vattenfall, Carl-Erik Nyquist, said he maintains the view that its is both wrong and violates Swedish law to close the nuclear power reactors at the Barseback plant.</p>
<p>- The head of municipal housing company Svenska Bostader, Esbjorn Olsson, resigned because of a clash with members of the organisation's board who want to keep property rents fixed rather than allow then to follow a free market.</p>
