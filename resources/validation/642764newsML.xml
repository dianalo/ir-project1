<headline>Podravka leads Croatian stocks, market seen quiet.</headline>
<dateline>ZAGREB 1997-06-06</dateline>

<p>Croatian stocks were mixed on Friday with leading issues overshadowed by food concern Podravka for the third straight day and traders predicted the situation would remain unchanged in the coming days.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are saturated with Zagrebacka Banka and Pliva. They are looking for new ideas, new companies,&quot; said one trader, who asked not to be named. &quot;Podravka will continue trading well next week, the rest will be boring,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Market heavyweights, fully-listed Zagrebacka Banka and drugs firm Pliva, which both trade their Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) in London, did poorly on Friday.</p>
<p>Pliva lost one kuna to 458 on volume of 900 shares, while Zagrebacka's ordinary shares did not trade at all, for the first time in months.</p>
<p>Marijana Reskovac of Karlovacka Banka said big investors were held away by the decline of Zagrebacka's GDRs in London.</p>
<p>But the bank's preference E-series stock, now favoured by many traders, posted new gains. It added 20 kuna to 1,290 on volume of 812 shares.</p>
<p>Podravka inched up 6 kuna to 276, with 2,126 shares sold. The company still needs to publish its overdue 1996 results, rumoured to be negative. But several traders said the concern started much better this year.</p>
<p>&quot;I have information that Podravka had a good start in 1997 and looks profitable now,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>He said it would continue its gradual rise and &quot;is bound to be traded in 290-300 kuna range very soon&quot;.</p>
<p>Friday's overall volume was down to 8,399 shares and the turnover was halved to 3.6 million kuna.</p>
<p>Brewery Karlovacka Pivovara, in which Chilean Compania Cervecarias Unidas has a majority stake, added 10 kuna to 340, with 807 shares sold. The brewery said recently it had doubled its 1996 net profit and predicted further growth.</p>
<p>Reskovac said small shareholders were constantly hoping trade in hotelier stocks would pick up. &quot;But it seems bulls will be quiet until autumn,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Of four active hoteliers two were up and two down.</p>
<p>Riviera Porec was the day's biggest gainer, adding 8 kuna or 5.8 percent to 138, on volume of 444 shares. Istraturist led the decliners. It lost 10 kuna or 5.9 percent to 160 on volume of 160 shares.</p>
