<headline>French minister tried to bar crime probe - weekly.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-11-12</dateline>

<p>A French investigative weekly said on Tuesday Justice Minister Jacques Toubon had ordered diplomats to track down a magistrate holidaying in Nepal to block a judicial probe against the wife of Paris mayor Jean Tiberi.</p>
<p>The well-informed weekly Le Canard Enchaine, which for decades has specialised in exposing official shady dealings, said Toubon ordered a helicopter chartered to locate investigating magistrate Laurent Davenas, then trekking in the Himalayas, and order him back to Paris.</p>
<p>Toubon aides did not deny the report outright but said the ministry had no helicopters.</p>
<p>Le Canard said Toubon wanted Davenas to return to Paris when it became clear the magistrate's deputy, Hubert Dujardin, had decided to open a probe into suspicions that Tiberi's wife Xaviere was paid from public funds for work she did not perform.</p>
<p>Tiberi is a member of the ruling Rally for the Republic (RPR) Gaullist party and was deputy to Jacques Chirac when he was Paris mayor. Chirac was elected president in May last year.</p>
<p>The helicopter failed to find Davenas who was out of touch when Dujardin did order the probe last week, Le Canard said.</p>
<p>Dujardin has since told reporters he took advantage of his superior's absence to launch the probe, as he was legally entitled to do, since the two men disagreed on the seriousness of the charges and he believed Davenas would fail to act.</p>
<p>The probe is to examine a report written by Xaviere Tiberi to verify her claim that it was produced in return for the sum of 200,000 francs ($40,000) paid her by the elected council of the Essonne region, near Paris.</p>
<p>Justice sources said last week that the probe would not automatically lead to her being placed under formal investigation, a procedure which could lead to her trial but does not indicate guilt.</p>
<p>Mayor Tiberi said he fully stood by his wife &quot;all the more since the blows against her are intended for me with a single aim: to destabilise me&quot;.</p>
<p>Investigating magistrate Eric Halphen, who is probing the finances of the RPR, questioned Xaviere Tiberi about the report last July after finding it during a search of her home.</p>
