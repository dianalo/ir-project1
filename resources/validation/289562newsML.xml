<p>Romania's National Bank (BNR) said on Monday it had jacked up its key indicative rate -- the discount rate -- to 50 percent from 35 percent.</p>
<p>The increase reflects a tighter monetary policy due to a surge in inflation and is in line with International Monetary Fund recommendations that the discount rate should be positive in real terms.</p>
<p>Year-on-year inflation quickened to 47.4 percent last November from October's 45.1 percent, sharply exceeding the 20 percent target agreed with the IMF for 1996.</p>
<p>Last year the IMF suspended a three-year standby credit of $460 million after criticising the lax policies of the leftist government thrown out in last November's general election.</p>
<p>The BNR's overdraft rate, similar to a Lombard rate, remained unchanged at 90 percent.</p>
<p>Domestic inter-bank money market prices and bank deposit rates are expected to rise in line with the discount rate.</p>
<p>The new centrist government has doubled fuel prices from January 1 in a bid to meet IMF recommendations that fuel prices be raised to world levels. The move is expected to trigger a rise in consummer prices in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>An IMF mission is expected in Bucharest this month to discuss a new loan accord with the reformist government headed by Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea.</p>
