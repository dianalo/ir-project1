<p>Here are the highlights of stories in the Danish press on Monday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>POLITIKEN</p>
<p>--The Danish Social Democrat-led minority government has come under heavy criticism from a united opposition for poor administration of the parliamentary work schedule. Over 100 bills have to be processed by parliament in its last 20 working days before the summer recess in early June, meaning that legislation risks getting a superficial treatment with a risk of errors occurring in laws.</p>
<p>BERLINGSKE TIDENDE</p>
<p>--After years in the doldrums, Denmark's textile industry is now in a more stable position, consolidating itself at home and winning new overseas markets thanks to improved marketing, development, sales and logistics.</p>
<p>--Danish NKT Cables can look forward to better times with a foot in new European markets and troubled Nilfisk vacuum cleaner expected to swing back into the black next year.</p>
<p>JYLLANDS-POSTEN</p>
<p>--Danish biotechnological giant Novo Nordisk wants to ensure that plans to reward leading staff with share options in the company will not be bogged down in complex tax rules which could deprive such options of any attraction or financial benefit. Meetings with Denmark's tax ministry are due to start soon on the problem.</p>
<p>BORSEN</p>
<p>--Following criticism, leading Danish telecommunications group Tele Danmark is to put its 100-150 million crown advertising account out to new bidders, a move which could hurt the present five firms dealing with its marketing and advertising campaigns.</p>
