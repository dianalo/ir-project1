<p>New car registrations in western Europe jumped 9.3 percent in April, driven largely by soaring sales in Italy due to a buying incentive scheme, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Registrations rose to 1,272,100 units from 1,164,100 the same month last year. In the first four months of the year, sales rose 0.8 percent to 4,696,000 cars, ACEA said.</p>
<p>However, there were wide variations between different countries, ranging from an increase of 52.4 percent in Italy in April to a 10.5 percent decline in France following the end of a government incentive scheme last year.</p>
<p>&quot;It is driven by incentives either up or down,&quot; said European car industry analyst Philip Ayton at investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. &quot;It is not a natural market right now.&quot;</p>
<p>The overall market is expected to rise by between one and two percent in 1997, Ayton said. &quot;It is pretty static but within an overall static number there are quite dynamic things happening with some markets strongly up and some much weaker.&quot;</p>
<p>ACEA spokesman James Rosenstein estimated 1997 growth at about two percent, despite the strong increase in April.</p>
<p>&quot;We said at the beginning of the year we expected about two percent growth for the overall market and we still think that will be about it,&quot; he said. &quot;Europe is no longer a high growth market, nor is the United States and Japan.&quot;</p>
<p>But, Rosenstein cautioned, &quot;you never can tell what is going to happen with the incentive effect, how long this kind of growth will be sustained in Italy.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the Italian plan, funded by the government and industry, car owners receive discounts on new cars when they trade in cars more than 10 years old. There is also a long-term buying incentive in Spain.</p>
<p>&quot;These incentives have in a sense distorted what would be a normal market evolution,&quot; Rosenstein said.</p>
<p>But there were also benefits with such schemes as they helped renew the car stock, increased sales on stagnant markets and benefited the environment.</p>
<p>New car registrations firmed a more modest 2.2 percent to 344,000 cars in Germany, Europe's largest market, but rose by an impressive 12.4 percent to 182,700 units in Britain.</p>
<p>Among individual car groups, Italy's Fiat group saw its new car registrations rise by 23 percent to 159,900 units, giving it a market share of 12.6 percent, second only to German giant Volkswagen AG.</p>
<p>The Volkswagen group's sales firmed 10.4 percent and its share of the western European market increased further to 17.9 percent from 17.7 in the same month in 1996.</p>
<p>U.S. giants General Motors and Ford also showed higher sales, up by 3.4 percent and six percent to 155,013 and 141,102 cars respectively.</p>
<p>New registrations of Japanese cars increased by 6.3 percent to 139,594 but the South Korean figure fell by 4.5 percent to 21,414.</p>
<p>It was also a good month for top-of-the-range brands like Jaguar, up by 43.9 percent to 1,658, and Mercedes, up by 20 percent to 50,200.</p>
<p>Sweden's Volvo saw its figure jump 31.1 percent to 22,670, helped by a 46.5 percent increase in the overall Swedish market following the end to uncertainties about government policy on company car taxation.</p>
