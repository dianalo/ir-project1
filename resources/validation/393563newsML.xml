<p>Prices of leading Russian shares fell on Friday as Western investors declined to buy but traders said domestic investors would provide support next week.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System 24-share index fell 4.4 percent to 331.82 from 347.20 on a total market volume of $39.7 million.</p>
<p>Domestic buyers boosted prices at midday after a fall on news that the Russian parliament had called for limits on foreign investment.</p>
<p>Power utilities, targeted by the Duma in a first reading of a bill, were especially hit by the news, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The news from the Duma sparked a sell-off of utilities UES, Mosenergo and in particular Irkutskenergo,&quot; said Andrei Kukk, head of share operations at Rinako Plus.</p>
<p>UES fell to $0.2375 from $0.2405, Mosenergo dropped to $1.450 from $1.537 and Irkutsk fell to $0.252 from $0.269.</p>
<p>But traders said domestic market players would prevent a strong correction next week, even if Western support was lacking.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe the market will not grow without Western support, but there will not be any catastrophic fall,&quot; Kukk said.</p>
<p>Oleg Martynenko, head of equity trading at Rossiisky Kredit said domestic players could show strong support.</p>
<p>&quot;Russian resources flowing from GKOs (discount Treasury Bills) are more mobile and will support the market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The worst performers on the RTS were Moscow City Telephone (MGTS) which fell to $1.30 from $1.60 at Thursday's close and AO Sakhalinmorneftegaz which fell to $2.90 from $3.40.</p>
<p>Lenenergo preferred shares fell to $0.595 from $0.680.</p>
<p>Traders said the market showed high volatility due to growing internal speculation.</p>
