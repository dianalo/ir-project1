<p>Mexico's gross domestic product likely grew between 4.5 and 5.0 percent in the first quarter, Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz said at a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to see if we are talking about the numbers for the first quarter adjusted for the number of working days or not corrected for those,&quot; Ortiz told reporters after the government released first quarter financial data.</p>
<p>&quot;If we talk about non-adjusted numbers for the working days, then it is likely that we will see the increase in production in a range from 4.5 to 5.0 percent...,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>He said on non-adjusted terms the increase was about 6.0 percent in the quarter.</p>
<p>The first quarter GDP data will be released on Monday.</p>
<p>A survey of analysts in Mexico City by Reuters had found expectations of growth of 5.12 percent for the quarter.</p>
<p>Easter week fell in March this year and affected industrial production as well.</p>
<p>Industrial production came in at a 6.2 percent increase in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The government said on Wednesday that due to the fact that Easter Week fell in March this year, and in April last year, there were 12 percent fewer working days in March this year, that is 22 this year and 25 last year.</p>
<p>As well, many people took an extra long weekend in March for the celebration of birthday of a former president.</p>
<p>The finance ministry said that without the fewer number of working days, industrial production would have grown 11.0 percent in March.</p>
