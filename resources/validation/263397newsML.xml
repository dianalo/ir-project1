<p>Austria's skiers may not be as extravagant and outspoken as Italian superstar Alberto Tomba but their domination in the men's World Cup is the most striking fact of the early Alpine skiing season.</p>
<p>From Toni Sailer to Karl Schranz or Franz Klammer, Austrians have long been the strongest team in speed events.</p>
<p>Their show of strength in Val d'Isere on Sunday -- four men in the top four places of the first men's downhill of the season -- confirmed the trend.</p>
<p>But they did it again in Monday's super-G, also the first this season, placing four men in the top five, six in the top 10, with winner Hans Knauss seizing the overall World Cup lead.</p>
<p>And though the flamboyant Tomba was the focus of attention on his return to the circuit from injury in a slalom at Madonna di Campiglio on Tuesday, the Italian had to settle for second place behind another Austrian -- Thomas Sykora.</p>
<p>It is the breadth of talent in the team that is proving so impressive this winter. The big names such as world downhill champion Patrick Ortlieb and veteran Guenther Mader -- who were both on the podium at Val d'Isere -- were always expected to do well. But Fritz Strobl was all but unknown on the World Cup before his downhill win here on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our secret right now is that we are forced to be at our best in training as well as in competition,&quot; said all-rounder Knauss.</p>
<p>Last week, Austrians clocked the six fastest times of the first downhill practice of the season here, thanks to the incentive of competition for team places.</p>
<p>&quot;We had to qualify for the race proper,&quot; said Fritz Strobl, who emulated namesake Josef by winning his first downhill in Val d'Isere.</p>
<p>The Austrians took the first two places of the opening slalom of the season in Park City, with Sykora and Thomas Stangassinger, and scored another double in a giant slalom in the Utah resort with Josef Strobl and Knauss.</p>
<p>The competition is so fierce that even Mader, one of the best skiers of the past 10 years, is worried about his up-and-coming compatriots.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now it is very difficult to make it into the team as many guys are capable of finishing in podium place,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope to be at my best for the world championships in Sestriere (in February) but first I'll have to qualify.&quot;</p>
<p>Luc Alphand, the best downhill specialist of the last two seasons, is not surprised by the success of a country in which 50 per cent of the population are skiers.</p>
<p>&quot;It is their national sport. It is as simple as that,&quot; the Frenchman said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have 50 guys battling it out for a place in the team when the French, the Italians or the Germans have but 20. And moneywise, they pour 50 million into Alpine skiing when France spend 20 million,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Swiss Steve Locher, one of three non-Austrians to have won a race this season, is also impressed by the strength of his team's traditional rivals.</p>
<p>&quot;To be the man who upsets the Austrians is a role I like,&quot; he said, after preventing them from a second clean sweep in 48 hours by taking third place in Val d'Isere's super-G.</p>
<p>&quot;But I have no illusions. They are far too many for one man to beat.&quot;</p>
