<title>USA: Brent steady late, US foreign crudes still ample.</title>
<headline>Brent steady late, US foreign crudes still ample.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-23</dateline>

<p>North Sea Brent was steady in late U.S. trading Wednesday amid moderate selling by a major European company, trade sources said.</p>
<p>A partial paper March Brent changed hands at $22.42 a barrel, down one cent from the IPE settlement.</p>
<p>April partials traded three times at $21.92 and once at $21.95, down five to seven cents from the London close, traders said.</p>
<p>Feb/March brent was dealt at 38 cents a barrel, while March/April moved at 45 cents, they said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, North Sea and West African crudes continue to rain on the U.S. Gulf Coast, reflecting the open transatlantic arbitrage.</p>
<p>The spread between Brent and West Texas Intermediate/Cushing for March was around $1.65-75 a barrel, down about five cents from late Wednesday but still high enough to encourage transatlantic trade.</p>
<p>A European company is offering Brent for early March delivery into the Gulf Coast at March WTI minus 30 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Two Nigerian Qua Iboe cargoes are on offer for late February and mid-March at around March WTI plus 40-50 cents delivered, traders said.</p>
<p>Latin American crudes such as Colombian Cusiana have crumbled under the weight of this transatlantic influx.</p>
<p>A European company sold Cusiana for February 6-7 to a Gulf Coast refiner at March WTI minus 65 cents a barrel fob, down about five cents from the last transaction.</p>
<p>State-owned Ecopetrol sold a separate Cusiana into the Gulf Coast at a discount of 45-50 cents a barrel, but that price is likely to come off of the April marker, traders said.</p>
<p>Some traders are warning of imminent oversupply in the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>&quot;The buying requirements have moved from market to market, delaying the supply glut that's coming any day,&quot; one trader said. &quot;Eventually it'll rain, and we'll have an oversupply situation.&quot;</p>
