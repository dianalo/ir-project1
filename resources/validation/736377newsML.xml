<headline>German debt, futures appear steady on firm footing.</headline>

<p>German Bunds and futures were steady in late dealings on Thursday and appeared to have firm footing as September Bund futures targeted 103.00.</p>
<p>Stable U.S. debt markets also helped to underpin market sentiment, which was cautious in morning dealings despite weakness in the mark.</p>
<p>But German debt was underperforming the U.S. market due to the weak currency amid some fears German debt prices could quickly fall in any sign of a correction in the U.S. market.</p>
<p>At 1515 GMT, DTB September Bund futures were up 38 basis points at 102.80.  </p>
<p>The 10-year 6.00 percent cash Bund due July 2007 was at 103.25 percent for a yield of 5.56 percent and up from the close on Wednesday at 102.86.</p>
<p>&quot;September Bunds are looking steady here and 103.00 is now the only key barrier protecting the 103.14/15 congestive region,&quot; MMS International said in a market commentary.</p>
<p>MMS said the market's recovery from 102.17 has been &quot;impressive&quot;, market sentiment was good and a push above 103.15 would open the way for a move toward 103.53.</p>
<p>A key factor driving the market has been the U.S. long bond breaking thge 6.5 percent yield barrier and posting more gains.  </p>
<p>And investors have been apparently deserting the long end of high-yield European debt in favour of hard-core markets such as Germany, which has been a factor in the recent gains.</p>
<p>But some traders are concerned the German market cannot keep pace with the U.S. amid lingering fears the Bundesbank may opt to raise rates to help shore up the currency.</p>
<p>Still, Bear Stearns said in a market commentary that the German yield curve will continue to flatten, particularly in the spread between two-year and 10-year debt that has broken below the key psychological level of 200 basis points and could soon test 175 basis points in the next one to two months.</p>
