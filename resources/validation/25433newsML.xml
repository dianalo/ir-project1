<p>A draw down in Singapore gasoline stocks to at least 20-month lows has offered some relief to a weak gasoline market, but the outlook remains bearish, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>Weekly light distillate stocks, which include gasoline, reformate and naphtha, fell in the week ended August 28 by 168,000 barrels to 4.711 million barrels -- the lowest level since end December 1994, according to statistics from Singapore's Trade Development Board.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is not surprising, considering Singapore gasoline is the cheapest in the world,&quot; said a trader from a Singapore refinery, referring to the drawdown.</p>
<p>A recent glut in Asia has increasingly prompted arbitrage cargoes west to the more lucrative and thirsty markets in Europe, Africa and the U.S., traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the arbitrage) is still working from Singapore to the west,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>The strong western markets have also attracted spot Saudi Arabian cargoes from its Yanbu refinery which would otherwise head east.  </p>
<p>Premium unleaded cargoes on Thursday were talked at $218/$220 a tonne ($25.65/$25.90 per barrel) in Northwest Europe while NYMEX September gasoline settled at 62.25 cents a gallon ($26.15 a barrel).</p>
<p>In comparison, Singapore gasoline was only $21.60 a barrel on Thursday, just a shade firmer from the previous day in spite of the fall in stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;Fundamentally gasoline is bearish,&quot; said a western trader.</p>
<p>Real regional demand was limited to Taiwan while in addition to Singapore export availabilities, Thailand, South Korea and Australia have length, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Gasoline is going to take a sideline, with the markets driven by middle distillate demand,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Traders said the fall in light distillate stocks was mainly due to refiners maximising their middle distillate production for winter although the cuts in Singapore refinery throughputs did remove some surplus.</p>
<p>Since the middle of the year, negative refining margins have forced Singapore refiners to cut their total production of 1.23 million barrels per day by up to 7 percent.</p>
