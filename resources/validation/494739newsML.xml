<title>CANADA: Former Quebec separatist head staying in politics.</title>

<text>
<p>The former leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, Michel Gauthier, said on Tuesday he would run again for the federal Parliament and that he was sure of a new Quebec independence referendum in the next term.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure we will have a referendum in the next mandate (of the federal House of Commons), and I will be there for that,&quot; Gauthier, replaced by former communist Gilles Duceppe as leader of the Bloc last month, told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;My target is to work for the sovereignty of Quebec and it's the main reason why I decided to be candidate once more.&quot;</p>
<p>Gauthier replaced separatist firebrand Lucien Bouchard -- now Quebec premier -- as leader of the Bloc last year, but was criticized for being less charismatic.</p>
<p>He said private citizens as well as Bloc members encouraged him to run again.</p>
<p>Quebec separatists narrowly lost a referendum on Quebec sovereignty in October 1995. The Quebec government cannot hold another referendum until it holds provincial elections, widely expected in 1998.</p>
