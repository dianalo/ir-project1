<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-03-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Upmarket retailer David Jones Ltd said on Monday that chief executive officer Chris Tideman had resigned, effective immediately, citing personal reasons.  </p>
<p>The company said Tideman, who joined in 1994, would return to Britain.</p>
<p>A statement on a new chief executive was expected to be made in the near future, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to voice our appreciation at what he has achieved as chief executive of David Jones, particularly during the float process,&quot; chairman Dick Warburton said.  </p>
<p>Tideman has overseen a difficult period for the Sydney-based retailer since it floated from the corporate remains of the indebted Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd group.</p>
<p>David Jones has consistently failed to meet its prospectus profit forecasts and its share price has been marked down sharply in the last year.</p>
<p>The company said in early January that it expected 1996/97 first half profit could be up to 50 percent below year ago levels, but partly qualified this pessimism later in the month.</p>
<p>It will release its profit result this Wednesday with Warburton scheduled to hold a news conference on the same day.  </p>
<p>A company spokeswoman said David Jones had someone in mind to replace Tideman but would not yet reveal the name.</p>
<p>David Jones shares closed one cent lower at A$1.71 on Monday.</p>
