<p>Taiwan on Thursday praised Guatemala for defying China's attempt to normalise relations, vowing to &quot;do whatever it can&quot; to provide necessary assistance to help its Central American ally.</p>
<p>&quot;We appreciate Guatemala's firm and longstanding support for us in the international community,&quot; President Lee Teng-hui told Guatemala's visiting parliament speaker.</p>
<p>&quot;The Republic of China cherishes the traditional friendship with Guatemala...it will do whatever it can to provide necessary assistance at the time when the country ends domestic turmoil and need to devote to national developments,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>Guatemala is one of only 30 countries, mostly poor states in Africa and Central America, which recognise Taiwan's exiled Republic of China government instead of Beijing's communist Chinese government.</p>
<p>Lee praised its Central American ally's courage for inviting Taiwan's Foreign Minister John Chang to attend the December 29 signing of a peace treaty that ended 36 years of civil war.</p>
<p>&quot;Guatemala's defiance of communist China symbolise the firm relationship between the two countries,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>Communist China, Taiwan's arch rival since a civil war split them in 1949, regards the island as a rebel province ineligible for foreign ties. It has tightened a diplomatic squeeze on Taipei in its quest to bring Taiwan under mainland rule.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said on Thursday that Guatemala's ties with Taiwan had destroyed any basis for cooperation from Beijing in the United Nations.</p>
<p>Guatemala's invitation to Taiwan's Foreign Ministry to attend the signing of the peace treaty had hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, Shen told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Shen stopped short of saying Beijing would veto a proposed U.N. peace-keeping mission to monitor the end of Guatemala's guerrilla war but accused Guatemala of hypocrisy in its dealings with Beijing.</p>
<p>China has withheld support for a United Nations' Security Council resolution to send 155 U.N. peace-keepers to Guatemala because of that country's close ties with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Diplomats have said they believe Beijing will not veto the measure but is trying to wring some concessions from Guatemala -- perhaps a high-level visit and an eventual trade mission to slowly wean the Central American country from Taiwan.</p>
<p>Guatemala, which receives considerable economic assistance from Taiwan, has vowed to maintain official relations with Taiwan despite the heavy pressure from China.</p>
