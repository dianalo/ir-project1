<headline>Judge -- Staples should explain secret data.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-04-30</dateline>

<p>A federal judge Wednesday ordered Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc. to explain by next week why evidence in the case against their merger should remain secret.</p>
<p>&quot;I need to know why it should be closed from the public,&quot; Judge Thomas Hogan told lawyers for the two office superstores. He said he wanted the explanation by May 6th.</p>
<p>Federal Trade Commission attorney Mel Orlans argued that the court should permit the public to see an uncut version of its brief arguing against the merger.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the crux of our case -- prices are higher where fewer (office) superstores compete,&quot; he said. &quot;We think this is important for the public to see.&quot;</p>
<p>Orlans said evidence showing prices are lower where Staples and Office Depot compete has remained secret and the two stores have declined to explain why they want it to remain so.</p>
<p>A lawyer for the office superstores, Christopher Curren, argued that once items were filed it was up to the other side to raise the issue of opening files. But the judge rejected that argument.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Reuters, Dow Jones and Bloomberg news services had also asked for the documents to be opened.</p>
<p>But attorneys for some others -- suppliers to Staples and Office Depot and retailers such as Kinko's and K-Mart Corp. -- expressed concern that papers concerning their companies might become public. They were among third parties that provided confidential pricing information to the FTC.</p>
<p>The judge set another hearing for Wednesday, May 7, at 9:30 a.m. EDT, and said he would also likely set a hearing for this Friday or Monday.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he said, some documents will be opened Thursday.</p>
