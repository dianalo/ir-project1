<p>Estonian investment house Baltic Cresco plans to be more agressive in Latvia and has several concrete projects coming up in August, Andres Ratsepp, Baltic Cresco chief executive, said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now we are active on the secondary market in Latvia, but we want to be more agressive on the placement side and not only on the secondary market,&quot; Ratsepp told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We look to be active on the primary market,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The investment company's plans include some financing projects in Latvia and some active promotion of its services.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a corporate financing project coming up in Latvia in August and we will be holding several presentations in Riga in late April,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Ratsepp remained positive on the Latvian market but said there was a problem with liqudity.</p>
<p>&quot;The Latvian market is very interesting as the stocks are cheaper and there can be a good increase in prices,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the problem is that the infrastructure of the stock exchange causes the liquidity to suffer,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Ratsepp also said Cresco was also actively watching Lithuania.</p>
<p>&quot;The Lithuanian market is large and more attractive and we are working there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ratsepp said that his firm was working on any privisation projects in Latvia and Lithuania at present but was monitoring developments.</p>
