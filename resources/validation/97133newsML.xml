<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in an interview published on Friday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies were setting the Arab world &quot;on fire&quot;.</p>
<p>He told the Israeli daily Maariv that Netanyahu, by opening a second entrance to a Jerusalem tourist tunnel near Moslem holy sites last week, had reignited the Palestinian uprising, which a historic 1993 interim peace deal had ended.</p>
<p>The tunnel opening sparked widespread gunbattles and clashes between Israelis and Palestinians. Since last week 58 Arabs and 15 Jews have died. Mubarak this week declined to attend a Washington summit on the violence.</p>
<p>He said relations between Israel and Egypt, which in 1979 became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel, had been influenced by Netanyahu's rhetoric.</p>
<p>&quot;The tunnel was not perhaps the principal thing but it certainly was the straw that broke the camel's back. The prime minister of Israel has to take into account that he is setting the entire Arab world on fire,&quot; Mubarak was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>He said the tunnel opening had to be taken in context with Israel's lifting a freeze on building housing for Jews on occupied Arab lands and the fact Netanyahu had yet to implement peace deals signed by the previous Israeli government.</p>
<p>Asked about his recent warnings that the Palestinian intifada or uprising would be revived, Mubarak said:</p>
<p>&quot;It has already begun and I am very afraid about what will happen in the future...What has begun has not yet ended. You carry the responsibility for peace and stability in the entire region.&quot;</p>
<p>Mubarak recalled suicide attacks against Israel carried out by Islamic militants opposed to PLO-Israel peace accords. The most recent in February and March killed 59 people in Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;Under Rabin and Peres there were serious attacks by those opposed to the peace process,&quot; Mubarak said referring to Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister assassinated by a right-wing Jew in November and his successor Shimon Peres defeated by Netanyahu in May elections.</p>
<p>&quot;With Netanyahu there are no attacks. Why? Because they think that he is not going toward peace and there is nothing to worry about.&quot;</p>
