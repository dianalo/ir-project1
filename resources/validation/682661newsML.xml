<title>HUNGARY: Eastbrokers starts Csopak with 'buy'.</title>
<headline>Eastbrokers starts Csopak with 'buy'.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1997-06-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hungary's Eastbrokers Securities initiated coverage of retail group Csopak Szovetkezeti Rt with a 'buy' recommendation, saying its shares were undervalued in light of its growth potential.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the low international profit increase potential of the retail sector, Csopak will double its earnings over the period of 1996-1998,&quot; analyst Gaspar T. Czako said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;This growth rate is also higher than the emerging market average,&quot; Czako said, adding that while the Hungarian retail sector has declined considerably, Csopak has increased its turnover and profitability well ahead of the inflation rate.</p>
<p>Czako said he expected Csopak's earnings per share (EPS) to grow by 80.22 percent to 328 forints in 1997 and by 74.09 percent to 571 forints in 1998, from 182 forints in 1996.</p>
<p>Hungary expects average inflation to go down to around 18 percent in 1997 from 23.6 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Our opinion is that in light of Csopak's growth figures the recent market price is undervalued,&quot; Czako said. &quot;The company's price per earnings ratio (PER) of about eight (calculated by EPS in 1997) is also very low compared to both market and sectoral PERs of 12.3 and 18.3, respectively.&quot;</p>
<p>Csopak was fast becoming an example of how an ambitious management team could build successful business from the remains of a collapsed planned economic retail system, by purchasing and restructuring old state retail companies, he said.</p>
<p>The Csopak group, in which Eastern European Food Fund holds an around 30 percent stake, plans further aggressive expansion in the sector, according to its strategy, the analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;The strategy targets first of all the acquisition of new regions in Hungary for its retail activity, where the activity of the multinational supermarket chains will be low in the future, too,&quot; Eastbrokers' Czako said.</p>
<p>On the Budapest Stock Exchange Csopak shares finished unchanged at 2,900 forints on Tuesday.</p>
