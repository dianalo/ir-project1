<p>The number of rigs exploring for oil and natural gas in the United States stood at 860 as of Feb. 14, up 27 from the prior week and 153 above the year-ago total of 707, Baker Hughes Inc. said Friday.</p>
<p>The number of rigs drilling on land rose by 32 to 733, while rigs working offshore fell five to 106. The number of rigs active in inland waters remained at 21.</p>
<p>The weekly rig count reflects the number of rigs exploring for oil and gas, not those producing oil and gas.</p>
<p>Among the individual states, the biggest changes occurred in Texas, which was up 26, Wyoming, which was down five, and California, which was down five. New Mexico was up eight.</p>
<p>A total of 362 rigs were exploring for crude oil, up 12 from last week. The number of rigs searching for gas was up 15 at 496, while the number of miscellaneous drilling projects remained at two.</p>
<p>In Canada, the number of working rigs was up three at 411 vs. 361 a year ago.</p>
<p>In a separate report, Offshore Data Services said there were 168 rigs under contract in the U.S. Gulf as of Feb. 14, unchanged from the week before.</p>
<p>The utilization rate for rigs working in the Gulf, based on a total fleet of 184, was 91.3 percent.</p>
<p>The number of working rigs in the European/Mediterranean area also remained unchanged at 105 rigs under contract out of a total fleet of 106, a utilization rate of 99.1 percent.</p>
<p>The worldwide rig count remained the same at 567 out of a total fleet of 606, for a utilization rate of 93.6 percent.</p>
