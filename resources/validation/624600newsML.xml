<p>Former French cabinet minister Nicolas Sarkozy said on Thursday there was consensus among the ruling centre-right that a single currency should not be delayed because of failure to cut deficits to exactly 3.0 percent of gross domestic product, the target set in the Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;I would prefer we respect the criteria if possible,&quot; said Sarkozy, who served as budget minister in the cabinet of former prime minister Edouard Balladur.</p>
<p>But &quot;there is a general consensus in the (centre-right) majority...monetary union will not be rejected because we are not exactly at 3.0 percent,&quot; he told journalists.</p>
<p>He was echoing comments this week by Prime Minister Alain Juppe who said it was &quot;obvious a second decimal point will be interpreted with intelligence and not using rigorous accounting methods.&quot;  </p>
<p>Juppe, who has pledged to quit no matter which party wins Sunday's runoff in French parliamentary elections, said &quot;rather than arguing about 3.1 or 3.2 percent&quot; it was more important that as many countries as possible joined in launching the euro.</p>
<p>The centre-right is in a tight battle for re-election after Sunday's first parliamentary election round which handed an unexpected victory to the left.</p>
<p>The government has been seeking to reassure voters ahead of the second round that not much more austerity would be needed to qualify for monetary union. Previously it insisted on the need for meeting the single currency conditions exactly.</p>
<p>The recent statements by the members of the centre-right coalition have brought it closer to the views of the Socalists.</p>
<p>The Socialists say they support monetary union, but oppose a new bout of austerity simply to fulfil a strict interpretion of the Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>But the government's stand puts it at odds with Germany which has said the 3.0 percent target cannot be waived.</p>
<p>Sarkozy, one of the centre-right's campaign spokesmen and sometimes mentioned as an outside contender to replace Juppe, also said it was important to have as many countries as possible in the first wave of monetary union.</p>
<p>He said postponing the 1999 scheduled start could have &quot;major consequences&quot; for closer European union.</p>
<p>He noted that the Maastrict treaty allowed for countries showing steady progress toward deficit and other goals to qualify for single currency membership.</p>
<p>Sarkozy, a member of the Gaullist RPR, added that if one of single currency's aims was to avoid competitive devaluations, &quot;it would be better to have the southern countries (such as Italy) in the euro rather than exclude them.&quot;</p>
<p>A recent European Union report said Italy would end 1997, the qualifying year for monetary union, with a deficit equal to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product which would disqualify the country if Maastricht were interpreted strictly.</p>
<p>Italy has said, however it is confident that it will hit the 3.0 percent target, helped by a supplementary budget.</p>
