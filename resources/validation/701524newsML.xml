<p>Some leading Russian shares surged on Wednesday on what dealers said was a new inflow of Western money, but traders said a slight technical correction began before the market closed.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index of 22 shares shot to a record 447.94 close on a record $100.27 million market turnover.</p>
<p>But some dealers said the market had already started to lose steam in the last few hours of trade.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just a market rally,&quot; said United City Bank head of securities Dmitry Yevenko. &quot;But we are already seeing a light technical correction since the market is clearly overheated.&quot;</p>
<p>National electricity company UES rose to $0.4055 after closing on Tuesday at $0.3724, but it was off a daily $0.4152 high.</p>
<p>International long-distance provider Rostelekom  RTKM.RTS ticked up to $4.45 after $3.97, but down from $4.49 earlier.</p>
<p>Oil company Surgutneftegaz  SNGS.RTS firmed to $1.120 from $1.095, while metals producer Norilsk Nickel  NKEL.RTS edged up to close unofficially at $10.20 after $9.65.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is strong but I so far have an ambiguous impression -- these levels are strangely high, although I don't rule out they will be higher,&quot; said Raiffeisenbank Austria's head of corporate securities, Sergei Sheikov.</p>
<p>Yevenko said investors were taking positions based on expectations of an increase in Russia's attractiveness for investment.</p>
<p>&quot;In September, Russia will be given a new (international credit) rating. It is clear it will be better...Many clients can (take positions) now,&quot; he said, adding the market could see support on Thursday if, as analysts expect, the U.S. Federal Reserve does not raise interest rates.</p>
