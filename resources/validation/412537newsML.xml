<p>French carmakers Renault and PSA Peugeot-Citroen will have to restructure to face increasing competition, French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;They will be confronted with the need to restructure themselves to compete better in an economy that is globalising,&quot; Arthuis said in an interview with Europe 1 radio.</p>
<p>He said the government took its decision this week to turn down a request from Renault and PSA to pay for the bulk of large early retirement programmes because they were too expensive and it was not the government's job to bail out those with problems.</p>
<p>&quot;The state is the taxpayer and the state's role is not to come constantly to the rescue of companies who need to remedy their difficulties,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It would have cost a considerable sum, several billion francs. The state does not have such a capacity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The companies say they need to cut the age and size of their workforces, among the oldest in the European car industry, to survive competition expected to grow even fiercer when the market opens up to the Japanese in the year 2000.</p>
