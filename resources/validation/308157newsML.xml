<p>Korean Air Lines sees a bumper UK-Seoul air cargo year due to increased Korean investment in Britain and in anticipation of sizeable new airfreight contracts and extra capacity on the route, said UK cargo sales manager Frank Smith.</p>
<p>He forecast the UK-Korea air cargo market would increase by at least eight percent in volume terms in 1997 following a 10 percent growth in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;In the UK, we comfortably achieved our 1996 $17 miliion revenue target. For this year, the initial target is $18 million but I am sure this will go up once details of extra KAL cargo capacity on the route have been finalised,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the trend towards industrial globalisation, Korean investment in Britain, where some labour costs are lower than in Korea, is soaring. Korean companies are producing more and more computer chips and parts in the UK and this has given a considerable boost to two-way London-Seoul air cargo traffic,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The main companies concerned, Smith added, were Samsung Co, Lucky Gold Star and Hyundai Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;Then there is the car industry. Daewoo has opened a design department in Worthing (Sussex, UK), which I recently visited. A new prototype has been created and this means that cars and spares are being flown back and forth between the two countries -- excellent business for us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Smith added he was as yet unaware of of any adverse effects on air cargo traffic from the UK to Korea being caused by the recent wave of industrial strife in Korea.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is early days yet. It is because of the jobs for life' philosophy the Korean government has been trying to change that labour costs have risen dramatically in Korea. It is the far more relaxed labour laws and lower social security costs in Britain that has stimulated Korean investment here,&quot; he noted.</p>
<p>In addition to the benefits for KAL Cargo UK that have been generated by this investment, Smith pointed to three other trade developments that he is expecting to boost business.</p>
<p>First is a plan by Marks and Spencer Plc to  MKS.L to open a chain of franchise department stores in Korea. &quot;They (M&amp;S) are talking about flying nine mid-deck containers, or 27 tonnes, of cargo a week from London to Seoul from mid-February,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Second, he added, was the appointment by the Korean government in mid-1996 of an Irish bloodstock breeder to establish a national stud farm on Korea's Cheju island.</p>
<p>&quot;This resulted in us flying a special Shannon-Cheju Boeing 747-200 cargo charter carrying 87 horses in November and three more of these charters are expected this year,&quot; said Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Korea has only become an industrialised country over the past 20 years, during which time its people have been quite prudent. Now they are really starting to spend their money and this is where horse racing comes in,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He noted that the stadium used for equestrian events in the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games had since been converted into a horse-racing track and that there were three others also operating in the country.</p>
<p>The third development on which Smith said he is pinning his hopes for a UK-Korea air cargo business bonus is the decision by KAL to sponsor the Benetton  BNG.MI Formula One motor racing team for the 1997 season, when Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi will again be the drivers.</p>
<p>KAL sources said the sponsorship announcement will officially be made at a function at the Planet Hollywood restaurant in London on January 23.</p>
<p>Smith said this is in anticipation of Korea becoming a Formula One race-hosting country from 1998 onwards. &quot;The go-ahead has already been given for the construction of a brand new track just outside of Seoul and this will be ready for next year,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;As the majority of Formula One cars are designed and built in Britain, I can see this being another boost for Korean Air Cargo,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Because of these positive trends, Smith said he was pleased London had been given the go-ahead over Milan by KAL's head office to start a second weekly Boeing 747 freighter service to Seoul commencing this summer.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the present weekly service was operated by an 87-tonne capacity 747-200F on a space-sharing basis with British Airways Plc  BAY.L.</p>
<p>He hoped the second frequency would be flown by a new 115-tonne capacity 747-400 freighter, Korean Air's second of this type, which is due to be delivered to the carrier in April.</p>
<p>&quot;Again, space will be shared with BA...the extra freighter service is allowed in the UK-Korea air bilateral. Apart from Korea, the second weekly flight will also enable me to allocate more ex-UK space to Japan during 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year, we concentrated our efforts on Korea because of the healthy state of that market from Britain,&quot; said Smith.</p>
