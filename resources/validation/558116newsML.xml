<dateline>SEOUL 1997-05-03</dateline>

<p>Stocks closed lower on Saturday as foreign investors retreated to the sidelines after active buying on Friday, the first day of a foreign stockholding limit expansion, brokers said.</p>
<p>The ceiling rose to 23 percent from 20 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign buying weakened. But instead local institutions bought small and medium-sized shares,&quot; said Na Min-ho, a broker at Daishin Securities.</p>
<p>The composite index closed 1.23 points lower at 704.87.</p>
<p>On Friday, foreigners bought some blue chips, while local institutions sold them to readjust portfolios.  </p>
<p>Volume was 32.72 million shares for Saturday's half-day trading, compared with 65.42 million on Friday.</p>
<p>Gainers outpaced losers 421 to 350 with 124 unchanged.</p>
<p>Brokers said about 500 billion won would flow in by next week with the expansion of foreign stock investment.</p>
<p>&quot;Fund inflows will help improve sentiment next week. The market will test the 740 level,&quot; said Koh Kyong-bae, a broker at Hyundai Securities. More than 40 shares had sold out to foreign investors on Friday, including SK Telecom, POSCO and Samsung Electronics, said an official at the Korea Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>But some brokers said a high level of loans for margin trading, which are believed to exceed customer deposits at brokerage houses by 10 billion won, could dampen sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;If we see a consolidation, the index could fell to 690 next week,&quot; said Na of Daishin.</p>
