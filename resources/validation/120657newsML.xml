<p>U.S. debt futures cut losses late and finished pit trading mixed.</p>
<p>Traders said December Treasury bond futures drew shortcovering late as locals who were dissatisfied with the morning's performance on the downside's covered, which helped Eurodollar futures edge back up as well.</p>
<p>The intermediate sector of the curve, especially the 10-year note, attracted good bids in trades that some brokers said smacked of concern about parking money in the long end should the market begin to fret anew about the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting resolve.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's a lack of commitment to the long bond,&quot; said a T-bond futures floor broker. &quot;It gives credence to your yield curve steepening-type trades.&quot;</p>
<p>Futures had briefly firmed but then eroded after benign consumer-level inflation data inspired few fresh buyers, and a technical stall-out left them vulnerable on the downside.</p>
<p>December Treasury bond futures, which firmed early in the day, eroded after no upside followthrough developed despite another report suggesting inflation remains under control.</p>
<p>Consumer prices last month rose 0.3 percent overall and in the core rate, exactly as forecast.  </p>
<p>But the report was unable to draw in enough buyers to hoist T-bonds above resistance near the 111-00 level.</p>
<p>The contract hit an intraday high on Wednesday of 110-27/32, or 2/32 below Tuesday's peak.</p>
<p>The pullback, which occurred on spurts of busy trade that featured good-size dealer selling, shoved nearby T-bonds back below a channel line and the 200-day moving average at 110-20/32, a level it had hurdled earlier in the session.</p>
<p>The sales, which brokers said looked like liquidation, also pushed T-bonds through support at 110-12/32, Tuesday's low and Wednesday's intersection of key trendline support.  </p>
<p>But selling petered out at 109-26/32, considered critical support by several brokers and also last Thursday's low.</p>
<p>Some technicians said a slew of indicators suggested  lower prices, with the 109-00 area mentioned as a plausible nearterm target. But the soggy close on Wednesday simply made others simply less optimistic about chances for higher prices.</p>
<p>&quot;It (close) makes me more neutral,&quot; added the T-bond floor broker. &quot;I had been bullish.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know what to think because there were so many cross-currents,&quot; said a broker who follows fundamentals. &quot;But I don't think the technicians are going to like this.&quot;  </p>
<p>In the short end, March Eurodollars also faced chart formation that pointed to the downside, especially after the contract formed a &quot;tweezer&quot; top based on Japanese candlesticks at 94.31, the high from Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>Similarly, the high was 94.30 during Monday's short session and last Friday.</p>
<p>At settlement, December T-bonds ended off 6/32 at 110-10/32, T-notes fell 1/32 to 108-06/32, muni-bonds lost 14/32 to 114-08/32, March Eurodollars ended flat at 94.27, and March T-bills rose one bp to 94.79. -Derivatives Desk(312)408-8750/E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com</p>
