<p>--------------------------(Dec 24)-----------------------------</p>
<p>*Stocks ended a shortened session just firmer on light volume ahead of the Christmas break. Volume 195.1 million, value A$380.4 million, 934 stocks traded, 283 steady, 380 up, 271 down.  </p>
<p>Australian shares closed just firmer on light volume with most investors absent from a shortened session ahead of the Christmas break on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>The benchmark All Ordinaries index closed 0.9 points firmer at 2,381.4, off its intra-session low of 2,386.2.</p>
<p>At 1.10 p.m (0210 GMT), the December share price index was 11 points up at 2,397, a 15.6 point premium to the physical.</p>
<p>The stock of Westpac Banking Corp was easily the busiest issue on the day after it went ex-dividend, paying a final dividend of 17 cents a share.  </p>
<p>&quot;It was a reasonably positive day for the market given the Westpac factor and the fact that so many players were absent,&quot; a Sydney-based dealer said.</p>
<p>Investor focus remained on the shares of regional banks Advance and St George which continued to travel in opposing directions after Advance shareholders approved a scheme to merge with St George on Monday.</p>
<p>Advance shares closed six cents higher at A$6.96 while St George shares ended 13 cents weaker at A$7.75.</p>
<p>The shares of beverage group Coca-Cola Amatil lent support to the market as they continued to recover from recent weakness.  </p>
<p>In other markets, Australian bonds had a fairly uneventful shortened session ahead of the two-day Christmas holiday with yields off slightly, which was purely a reflection of a firm U.S. Treasury market on Thursday.</p>
<p>The yield on 10-year T-bonds closed at 7.44 percent, down 0.01 percentage point from Monday's close.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar extended its softly, softly rally by another 1/4 cent at the midsession even as the local market wound down early for the Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>At 1.10 p.m. (0110 GMT), the unit was quoted at US$0.7994/99.  </p>
