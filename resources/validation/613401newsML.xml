<p>Belgium has pulled out nearly half of its 700-strong military force stationed in Brazzaville before the rebel takeover in Kinshasa across the river Congo, a spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>The United States and Britain, two of five Western states that brought in troops to evacuate their citizens in case of anarchy in Kinshasa, expect to complete their withdrawal this week, officials said.</p>
<p>Belgian spokesman Major Jacques de Corninck told Reuters 317 paratroopers were flown out on Sunday and the remainder would return home sometime this week.</p>
<p>&quot;The date hasn't been fixed yet, but if all goes according to plan it'll happen in the course of the week,&quot; he said of the withdrawal of the remaining troops.</p>
<p>Belgium, the United States, France, Britain and Portugal assembled forces totalling more than 4,000 in Central Africa.</p>
<p>They have been scaling down the mission since Laurent Kabila's rebels captured Kinshasa on May 17 without the feared mayhem and renamed Zaire the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>U.S. forces had been scheduled to complete their departure by last Wednesday. Washington's ambassador to Congo, Aubrey Hooks, said on Thursday that a decision on dates &quot;would be taken within the coming week&quot; and that the departure was likely to take another week at most.</p>
<p>All but two members of the British contingent have either returned home or left for Libreville, Gabon, where part of the evacuation force was stationed.</p>
<p>&quot;In the next three or four days there'll be no (British) forces left in Gabon or Brazzaville,&quot; said a British officer. &quot;We have cut back to an absolute minimum now the threat has died down.&quot;</p>
<p>The French contingent could not be reached for comment. Individual French soldiers indicated in the past few days they were likely to spend another month in Brazzaville.</p>
<p>There was no immediate word about plans for the Portuguese troops.</p>
