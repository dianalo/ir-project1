<p>An end to Cambodia's civil war could deliver a sizeable peace dividend and help curb widespread government corruption, opposition leader Sam Rainsy said.</p>
<p>The Khmer Nation Party (KNP) president said an end to the war against Khmer Rouge guerrillas would allow the government to halve its defence budget and eliminate corruption, saving more than $6 million.</p>
<p>Rainsy, a former finance minister whose party is not legally recognised, told the Foreign Correspondents Club of Cambodia late on Thursday that the government spends too much on defence.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge signed a peace accord in 1991 but later reneged on the accord and have since been fighting the coalition government that emerged from U.N.-run elections in 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not be surprised if two-thirds of the current total expenditures are devoted to the army. This is terrible. No country can bear such a burden,&quot; Rainsy said.</p>
<p>He also alleged that corrupt officials were using some 100,000 &quot;ghost&quot; civil servants, police and soldiers to collect extra salaries.</p>
<p>The government acknowledges that corruption is a major problem, reflecting in part the administration's poverty and an influx of money after the signing of the 1991 peace accord, but officials have said Rainsy overstates the situation.</p>
<p>Rainsy said well-armed military and civilian officials have also used the instability of the civil war to screen illegal activities, which he said include logging Cambodia's dwindling forest reserves and smuggling goods across its borders.</p>
<p>The government has been negotiating with breakaway commanders of the Khmer Rouge, which was responsible for the deaths of more than one million people during the group's 1975-79 rule. Officials hope the talks will help bring an end to more than two decades of strife and destruction.</p>
<p>Rainsy was sacked as finance minister in 1994 and was last year expelled from the royalist FUNCINPEC party and parliament because if his criticism of the government.</p>
