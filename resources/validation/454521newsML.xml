<headline>UK censors approve &quot;sex and wrecks&quot; film &quot;Crash&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>British censors have cleared the controversial &quot;sex and wrecks&quot; film &quot;Crash&quot; to be shown in cinemas without any cuts, but only for adults.</p>
<p>James Ferman, director of the British Board of Film Classification, said the &quot;unusual and disturbing film&quot; which depicts characters sexually aroused by car crashes was neither illegal nor harmful.</p>
<p>David Cronenberg's film, shown so far in Britain only at film festivals, had been greeted with critical revulsion. It was banned by the London council which covers the main cinemas in the capital.</p>
<p>The censorship commission said it had shown the film to a lawyer, a forensic psychologist and disabled people before making its decision.</p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday explaining its ruling that the film can be seen by anyone of 18 and over, it said: &quot;The car crashes are stripped of exciting spectacle. The mood is often slow and dreamlike, and the audience is not encouraged to share the feelings of the characters.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Crash&quot; hinges on a couple who survive a car accident, find it erotic and indulge in roadside sex. It was awarded the jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival.</p>
<p>&quot;The film is sexual but not violent,&quot; said its Canadian director Cronenberg, renowned for turning horror into high art. &quot;I don't think somebody is going to see this film, copy it and go and look for car crashes to get off on.&quot;</p>
<p>Starring James Spader of &quot;Sex, Lies and Videotape&quot; and Holly Hunter of &quot;The Piano&quot;, the film has been well received in France and Canada.</p>
