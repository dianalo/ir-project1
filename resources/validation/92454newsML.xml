<title>MALAYSIA: Malaysian Global gets ship financing.</title>
<headline>Malaysian Global gets ship financing.</headline>

<p>Malaysian shipping company Global Carriers Bhd signed a deal on Wednesday for the financing of the acquisition of four container vessels costing a total of 150 million ringgit.</p>
<p>Arab-Malaysian Finance Bhd is lending Global Carriers a total of 165 million ringgit for the acquisition of the ships, officials from the finance firm and Global said.</p>
<p>&quot;A substantial portion of the 165 million ringgit vessel financing facilities will be used to part finance the acquisition of these vessels, whilst the balance will be set aside for future acquisitions,&quot; said Mohamad Hashim, executive chairman of Global Carriers, in a speech at the signing ceremony.</p>
<p>Mohamad also said that each ship would have a carrying capacity exceeding 1,000 20-ft equivalent units (TEUs), and would weigh around 20,000 dead weight tonnes (DWT).</p>
<p>&quot;These ships will be carrying mainly non-dangerous cargo, so it will be easier to meet safety requirements of most ports,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>All four vessels would carry the Malaysian flag, which according to Hashim, would be roughly four times cheaper than registering them in Japan.  </p>
<p>Hashim said that the vessels would be bought from two European owners, and chartered out to another two European owners for a period of two to four years.</p>
<p>Two ships would ply the Mediterranean-to-Canada run, while the other two are slated for the China-to-Port Klang route, he said.</p>
<p>The companies did not reveal the precise terms of the financing except that the loan would be on a credit line basis, where the tenure and interest rate for each tranche would be agreed upon separately depending on the age and the condition of each vessel.</p>
<p>Global Carriers currently operates 18 vessels of which 12 are owned by the group.</p>
