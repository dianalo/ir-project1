<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange surged on early heavy buying on Friday with speculators predicting a sharp drop in domestic interest rates next year, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said all contracts based on the benchmark three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) were sharply higher after breaking through key technical barriers.</p>
<p>A few buyers were also looking to hedge their loan portfolios against a drop in interest rates next year, they said.</p>
<p>By 0700 GMT, volume had shot up to 1,012 lots across all contracts against less than 600 on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is a little of both, speculation and hedging,&quot; said the trading floor manager of a leading futures brokerage.</p>
<p>At 0700 GMT, the three-month KLIBOR contract for December was one point higher at 92.84, translating into an implied yield of 7.16 percent.</p>
<p>Next year's contracts were more volatile. March was up five points at 93.05, or an implied yield of 6.95 percent, June up six at 93.21, or 6.79 percent, September up four at 93.23, or 6.77 percent, and December up seven at 93.26, or 6.74 percent.</p>
<p>The three-month KLIBOR, an indicative rate set at 0300 GMT daily from contributions of all commercial banks, was at 7.29 percent on Friday. Actual trading in three-month money was at 7.20/25 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the things that triggered today's buying is that the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield has hit an eight-month low,&quot; said Margaret Hotopp, general manager of brokerage TA Futures.</p>
<p>She said heavy buying started on Thursday when interbank rates fell slightly due to fresh liquidity in the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is pretty bullish. Many are still buying,&quot; she said, adding that it was a good time to book profits.</p>
<p>K. Sree Kumar, executive director of KAF-Refco Futures, said the market was looking at three-month rates falling below 7.00 percent as early as the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>&quot;Malaysia's current account deficit is going to narrow further, inflation is under check and I believe overseas interest rates are going to take a small dip. The rates here will follow suit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Many dealers said the drop in U.S. 30-year Treasury yield was being used as an excuse by local players though there was no direct link.</p>
<p>&quot;When it comes to far months you can be anywhere if the bullish sentiment persists,&quot; said Radhakrishnan Nair, executive director of brokerage Amanah Futures &amp; Options.</p>
<p>&quot;But, does it reflect the underlying cash market? I don't think there is any sign at this point of time that rates are going to come off,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the Economic Report for 1996/97, the government has foreacast that tight monetary policy will continue.</p>
<p>&quot;Maintaining non-inflationary growth will remain the broad thrust of macroeconomic management in 1997... Fiscal prudence and tight monetary policy will continue to be pursued to contain demand pressures,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Money market dealers also said that apart from slight fluctuations due to temporary liquidity changes, interest rates would remain firm in the near and medium term.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market had been on an uptrend since the annual budget for 1997 was announced on October 25, with a few brokerages buying aggressively for their customers.</p>
