<p>The widow of a Palestinian who fired on tourists and killed himself at New York City's Empire State Building said in Gaza on Monday that personal despair rather than politics was behind the shooting.</p>
<p>Fathiya Abu Kamal, 55, said her husband Ali Abu Kamal was cheated out of his life savings of about half a million dollars after he travelled to the United States last December seeking a financier for a new investment company.</p>
<p>&quot;My husband thought his life ended at that point and there is no way to compensate him,&quot; she told Reuters. &quot;He was 69 years old, he could not regain his money. If he really fired the shots it is only out of despair and disappointment.&quot;</p>
<p>On the famous building's 86th floor observation deck Abu Kamal killed one tourist, seriously wounded six others and then shot himself. He died of his wounds hours later.</p>
<p>New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the gunman was carrying documents that showed he lived in Ramallah in the West Bank and was born in Jaffa, now inside Israel. His family said he was born in Ramle, also now in Israel, and lived in Gaza.</p>
<p>Guiliani said a joint terrorism task force of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and city police would investigate the shootings.</p>
<p>The widow insisted there was no political motive.</p>
<p>&quot;My husband is not a terrorist, he was just hopeless,&quot; she said. &quot;He was aged, he had nothing to do with politics, or terrorism, or crime.&quot;</p>
<p>Abu Kamal's widow, six children and relatives mourned him at their home in Gaza City's middle class Rimal neighborhood. Relatives said Abu Kamal had been an English teacher at a college for 50 years and was planning to start a business.</p>
<p>Abu Kamal's 34-year-old daughter Mervat said: &quot;My father has had nothing at his heart against the Americans. He was gentle and calm and was only seeking business in America.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think that my father felt injustice practiced on him and that he was shocked and thus acted as he did,&quot; Linda, another daughter, said.</p>
<p>She said an aquaintance in New York told the family Abu Kamal was involved in a business relationship with some people who had cheated him out of all of his money.</p>
<p>Before that, he had told his family he wanted to take them all to the United States &quot;to enjoy a better life.&quot;</p>
<p>The widow appealed to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to have the body sent to Gaza for burial and also requested to be informed of &quot;the mysterious circumstances of his death&quot;.</p>
