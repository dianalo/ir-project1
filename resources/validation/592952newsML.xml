<p>Hong Kong's controversial provisional legislature turned planned curbs on civil liberties in the territory a step closer to reality on Saturday.</p>
<p>Bills banning donations by foreign political groups to local political parties and allowing some demonstrations to be barred on the grounds of &quot;national security&quot; were passed in first and second readings by the provisional legislature, local television and radio stations reported.</p>
<p>China, angered by democractic reforms enacted by Britain, set up the preovisional legislature in December to replace the currently elected Legislative Council after the colony reverts to Beijing, now just 45 days away.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's future government wants the bill to be passed in its final reading before midnight on June 30, when the territory reverts to China after 156 years of British rule.</p>
<p>Though Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa diluted his original plan to amend civil liberties laws following widespread criticism, the amended proposal continues to draw flak in Hong Kong and the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States has believed very strongly that the existing ordinances adequately protect human and political rights in Hong Kong,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten also argued there was no need to change laws after the British pull out.</p>
<p>&quot;What still hasn't been addressed is the question of why these changes (to civil liberties laws) are necessary in the first place,&quot; Patten said.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been Governor in Hong Kong for five happy years and I've never felt there was any demonstration taking place in Hong Kong -- and there have been a lot which I've been here -- which threatened the national security of China or the national security of the United Kingdom,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pro-democracy movement and lawyers in Hong Kong have also blasted Tung's plan.</p>
<p>The Beijing-backed legislature was also presented three bills on arrangements for the territory's municipal and district council after the handover.</p>
<p>The bills would allow Tung to appoint extra members into the fully elected municipal and district bodies.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's popular Democratic Party has said it would launch a legal challenge against the shadow legislature in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Democrats say it is constitutionally illegal to have two such bodies legislating at the same time.</p>
<p>The legislature holds it meetings in China, across the border from Hong Kong.</p>
