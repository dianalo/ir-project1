<headline>Sudan's Bashir says wants good relations with West.</headline>
<dateline>KHARTOUM 1997-03-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir said on Monday his country wanted to improve its relations with western countries as long as they did not interfere in Sudan's internal affairs.</p>
<p>Bashir said in a speech to the third session of Sudan's parliament that he wanted to maintain contacts with the United States so the two countries could resolve their differences.</p>
<p>The United States says Sudan is one of several countries that sponsor international terrorism. Sudan denies the charge.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to stress that Islam, our faith, forbids us from resorting to violence, aggression or terrorism,&quot; Bashir said.</p>
<p>He said Sudan wanted to base its relations with the West on the principles that &quot;we respect their choice and they respect our own choice&quot;.</p>
<p>A United States decision to provide non-lethal military aid to Eritrea, Uganda and Ethiopia has angered Sudan, which accused them of assisting anti-Khartoum rebels, a charge the three African countries deny.</p>
<p>The U.S. has an embassy in Khartoum but its ambassador resides in Nairobi.</p>
