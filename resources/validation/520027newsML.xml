<headline>Dollar sticks to narrow ranges in late Europe.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>The dollar was mostly steady in late European trade with activity sluggish and few fresh factors around to pull it out of the session's narrow ranges.</p>
<p>The dollar and U.S. asset markets paid little attention to a rise in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index today. The preliminary index for April rose to 101.00 from a final 100.00 in March and was well above average expectations of 99.8.</p>
<p>Dealers said the rise indicated U.S. consumers appeared to have taken the Federal Reserve's rate rise in March in their stride, hardening expectations of another near-term rate rise.  </p>
<p>Dollar/mark paid more attention to events in Europe, picking up from earlier lows after a French government source denied rumours that French President Jacques Chirac recently told German Chancellor Helmut Kohl he had withdrawn support for Italy's drive to join Europe's monetary union.</p>
<p>Mark/lira fell back from earlier highs on the denial, which lent some support to dollar/mark.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like expectations of a broad EMU start haven't entirely faded and we're seeing a little late support for the  </p>
<p>Dollar/mark stood at 1.7156/61 at 1508 GMT, above earlier lows of 1.7133 marks but off late Thursday's 1.7220/26 marks.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen was also rangebound, trading at 126.00/05 in late trade, slightly up from Thursday's 125.62/72 yen.</p>
<p>Mark/yen was firmer, extending its overnight gains in late Europe to trade at 73.43/46 yen from 72.68/71 Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there's a perception that the yen is going to weaken further in the near-term. The mark, if anything, has gone the wrong way against the yen recently... So we're seeing a bit of recovery,&quot; said David Brickman, European economist at Yamaichi International in London.  </p>
<p>But dealers said the market's tendency to consolidate at the end of a chaotic week was likely to continue until next week's G7 finance ministers' meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;After the comments this week from Sakakibara and Tietmeyer the market is left in limbo at the moment,&quot; said a U.S. bank dealer. &quot;We will probably see this consolidation until the G7.&quot;</p>
<p>Japanese Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara said this week Japan would intervene in the forex markets when appropriate and when it would be effective. He also warned markets not to assume Japan would not raise interest rates within the next year.  </p>
<p>Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said on Thursday the central bank was not interested in seeing the mark weaken any further although it did reflect fundamentals at current levels.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer's comments gave early support to the mark, particularly against the Scandinavian currencies.</p>
<p>The stronger mark pushed the Norwegian crown to its lowest level since late December and the Finnish markka to a seven-month low, prompting intervention by the Bank of Finland.</p>
<p>But by late trade, the crown recovered all the ground lost earlier in the session, trading at 4.1200/30 per mark, well above its intraday low of 4.1620 crowns.  </p>
<p>The markka was also firmer, trading at 3.0150/80 per mark, well below the session's markka low of 3.0300.</p>
<p>Mark strength pushed sterling down through support at 2.80 marks in late trade. By 1540 GMT, sterling was trading at 2.7938/43 from 2.8058/68 late Thursday.</p>
<p>Sterling/dollar, meantime, was firm though off earlier levels, trading at $1.6316/26 from $1.6235/45 Thursday.</p>
