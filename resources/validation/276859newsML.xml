<p>Crude oil prices drifted sideways in extremely quiet trade on Thursday in Asia, amidst a dearth of market leading factors and participants, due to the Christmas holidays, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is dead quiet, lacking direction with overseas futures markets closed,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>NYMEX energy markets will resume trade later on Thursday, while the IPE will reopen on Friday for a shortened trading session ending at 1730 GMT.</p>
<p>Cash February Brent was notionally assessed at $23.35/23.45 unchanged from late Tuesday U.S. levels.  </p>
<p>Dubai inter-month spreads were assessed weaker as the remaining estimated four to five wet February cargoes are not expected to attract buying interest unless prices come down, traders said.</p>
<p>February/March Dubai was assessed at about 35/45 cents and March/April at 45/55 cents, compared to previous levels of 45/55 cents and 55/65 cents, respectively.</p>
<p>Sellers of February Dubai are targetting full month quotes plus about 80 cents, whilst buyers are seen aiming for below 70 cents, traders said.  </p>
<p>Traders expect the Brent/Dubai spread to strengthen, reflecting weaker Dubai quotations. March Brent/Dubai was notionally assessed at $1.90/1.95.</p>
<p>Japanese refiners have covered their nearby requirements, ahead of their New Year holidays which start this weekend and last until January 6.</p>
<p>The American Petroleum Institute (API) will release its weekly oil inventory data later on Thursday instead of its regularly scheduled time of Tuesday evening, which was a holiday for the API.</p>
