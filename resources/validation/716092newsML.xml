<p>A passenger was sucked out of a Brazilian TAM airplane and fell to his death on Wednesday after an explosion tore a hole in the fuselage, the airline said in an official statement.</p>
<p>The Fokker-100 aircraft made an emergency landing at Sao Paulo's domestic Congonhas Airport at 8:52 a.m. (1152 GMT) following the blast at the back of the plane.</p>
<p>&quot;The incident which has signs of an explosion caused damage at the back of the aircraft on the right side with an object possibly located in the 16th row of seats,&quot; the statement said. &quot;The incident ... tore a large hole in the fuselage and caused damage to the inside of the aircraft.&quot;</p>
<p>Police found the body of the missing passenger, Fernando Caldeira de Moura Campos, next to parts of the airplane in a field outside the town of Suzano, 31.4 miles (50 km) from Congonhas Airport.</p>
<p>TAM said six of the 60 passengers and crew on board flight 283, en route from Vitoria, Espirito Santo state, to Sao Paulo were injured and taken to a hospital. A passenger on the flight told Reuters there was a loud explosion at the back of the aircraft shortly after a stopover in Sao Jose dos Campos.</p>
<p>&quot;I was sitting in the front of the plane but I could feel how I was being sucked towards the hole in the fuselage. The pressure in the cabin fell sharply,&quot; said Eloir Cavati. &quot;There was panic and we all started praying, even the flight attendants.&quot;</p>
<p>TAM Vice President Luiz Eduardo Falco told reporters the aircraft landed with all emergency doors intact and both engines functioning normally, denying police reports that one door had been blown off. He said the explosion could have been caused by a structural fault in the plane or by a device.</p>
<p>&quot;We did not have any problems with the primary structure of the airplane in the past,&quot; Falco said. &quot;We don't know what exploded or when it was brought on the plane.&quot;</p>
<p>He said TAM had not received a bomb threat and there was no pressurized container inside the cabin that could have caused the explosion. &quot;This is an incident which demands a very serious investigation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Aviation and the Federal Police have launched an inquiry into the accident, which comes eight months after another Fokker-100 TAM aircraft crashed into homes in a densely populated area of Sao Paulo, killing 98 people, including two on the ground.</p>
<p>TAM is Brazil's top regional carrier and its fastest growing airline. Brazilian business magazine Exame recently voted TAM company of the year.</p>
