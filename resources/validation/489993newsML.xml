<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was to arrive in India on Sunday for a meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), thrusting the Middle East peace process to the top of the conference's agenda, officials said.</p>
<p>Arafat was expected to arrive in the Indian capital late on Sunday and address a special plenary session of NAM foreign ministers meeting on Monday morning, Palestinian ambassador to India Khalid el-Sheikh told Reuters.</p>
<p>The conference's secretary-general, Savitri Kunnadi, said the movement was considering adopting a special declaration on the Palestinian issue after Arafat's speech. The Palestinians hold the vice presidency of the 113-member NAM.</p>
<p>A draft of the meeting's conclusions said the movement's members &quot;reaffirmed their full support for the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people to secure their inalienable rights to self-determination and independence and reiterated their demand for the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Palestinian and other Arab lands, including Jerusalem&quot;.</p>
<p>The draft, obtained by Reuters, was expected to be finalised and adopted by NAM ministers on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Palestinian ambassador to India said senior officials of NAM member-states on Saturday approved a draft resolution calling for a special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the Palestinian issue.</p>
<p>Arafat's surprise visit to New Delhi was expected to dominate the first day of the NAM meeting and push the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process to the top of its agenda, which will otherwise focus on U.N. reform and disarmament.</p>
<p>Middle East peace talks were halted after Israel began work last month on a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, sparking daily clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Palestinian officials warned of a &quot;comprehensive explosion&quot; which could lead to more confrontations and said they were sending a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was scheduled to meet Clinton on Monday.</p>
<p>Arafat was to meet Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma, Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral on Monday.</p>
