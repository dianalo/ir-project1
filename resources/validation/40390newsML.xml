<p>Forget the practice swings, the golf etiquette, the casual pace. Just hit quick.</p>
<p>A group of about 100 golfers at the Tatnuck Country Club here on Monday broke the world record for the fastest round of golf on a course at least 6,000 yards long with a time of nine minutes 28 seconds.</p>
<p>The record, however, still must be verified by the London-based Guinness Book of World Records.</p>
<p>&quot;We took a few tries to do it and weren't going that well, and all of a sudden we had 18 holes that clicked,&quot; Tatnuck pro Jack Gale told Reuters.</p>
<p>The strategy for speed golf is all about saving seconds.</p>
<p>One person tees off. Four or five players waiting on the fairway hit the second shot towards the green, where more people are waiting to hit the approach shot and putt.</p>
<p>When the ball goes into the hole, a tee shot on the next hole is immediately taken, Gale said.</p>
<p>The group, from eight central Massachusetts country clubs and from a local restaurant, raised about $20,000 for a local charity in trying to break the Guinness record time of nine minutes 42 second set on Nov. 16, 1992, by a 35-member team in Point Micu, California, he said.</p>
<p>Gale said it took about 10 rounds on the nine-hole course before they broke the record, shooting a par 70 with a time of 5:07 on the first nine and 4:21 on the second nine.</p>
<p>&quot;It takes a lot of precise shots to do it. That 4:21, believe me, there was hardly a shot missed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Officials with the Guinness Book in London said they would need statements from witnesses and newspaper articles to confirm the record.</p>
<p>Gale said the group had official time keepers and witnesses, including the mayor of Worcester, to verify the time.</p>
