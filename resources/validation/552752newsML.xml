<p>The United Arab Emirates has lifted a ban on Oscar blockbuster &quot;The English Patient&quot; after censoring five scenes, Dubai newspapers reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The World War Two romance set in the Sahara Desert, which won nine Academy Awards in Los Angeles last month, violated Islamic morals, the country's ministry of information and culture ruled.</p>
<p>The film was banned three days after its UAE opening when a government official who saw it took offence. It had already been censored prior to being released in the Gulf state.</p>
<p>Five scenes considered improper have been cut, an official source at the ministry told Gulf News. One showed a sex scene with the sound of the Moslem call to prayer in the background.</p>
<p>&quot;It was inappropriate and offensive, from a religious point of view, to have the sound of the Azaan (call to prayer) in the background of the scenes which were removed,&quot; the official was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The film is due to reopen in UAE cinemas this weekend.</p>
