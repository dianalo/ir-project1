<title>USA: United Meridian extends Ivory Coast field.</title>

<p>United Meridian Corp said Thursday its Kudu 1 well, drilled offshore Block CI-01 in easternmost Ivory Coast, extended the Kudu field 1.5 miles to the northeast.</p>
<p>The company said confirmation of Kudu as a significant natural gas field allows it to move forward with plans to develop this and other previously drilled natural gas fields in eastern Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>The company said it may drill as many as three appraisal wells on the Kudu prospect in 1997 to define the full extent of the field.  </p>
<p>As the Kudu gas is particularly rich and lends itself to liquid petroleum gas separation, United Meridian said, it has entered the design and engineering phase for an LPG extraction plant in Abidjan, the Ivory Coast capitol, which would use feedstock of 75 million cubic feet per day from Block CI-01 and CI-11 with which to produce 1,550 barrels of liquids per day to supply to the rapidly expanding local LPG market.</p>
<p>United Meridian said the well encountered 75 feet of net pay in one interval and flowed 27.7 million cubic feet of natural gas and 740 barrels of condensate per day from that zone at a depth of about 7,300 feet.  </p>
<p>While test results were limited by the capacity of mechanical facilities, the company said, the reservoir in this well is calculated to to be capable of delivering in excess of 80 million cubic feet of natural gas per day into the proposed pipelines to the Abidjan and Ghana power markets.</p>
<p>The Kudu 1 is located 1.5 miles from a well drilled during the mid-1980's which tested a cumulative 39 million cubic feet of gas and 1,200 barrels of condesate from two zones, one of which is the zone that was tested in the Kudu 1.</p>
<p>United Meridian operates Block CI-01, holding a 45-percent working interest. Partners include PETROCI, the national oil company, and Yukong Ltd, holding respective 40 percent and 15 percent interests.</p>
<p>The Adriatic IV rig, which drilled Kudu, will immediately move 107 miles west and begin drilling the Leopard 1, a 10,330 foot exploratory test on Block CI-12, in which the company holds a 27-percent interest. Results are expected by mid-March.</p>
