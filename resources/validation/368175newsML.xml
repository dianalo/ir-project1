<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The key December three-month Euroyen futures contract shed its earlier gains to end flat on Monday.</p>
<p>Euroyen futures had risen in the morning due to the yen's rise versus the dollar after the weekend Group of Seven (G7) meeting, but edged downwards in the afternoon due to a rise in Tokyo share prices and a fall in Japanese government bonds, traders said.  </p>
<p>The Tokyo money market will be closed on Tuesday for a national holiday. Trade will resume on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders said moves in the currency market after the G7 were not having that big an impact on Euroyen futures so far.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the yen's rise versus the dollar has had much effect. Some said the cessation in the yen's fall was taken as a positive sign for JGBs and led to buying of Euroyen futures in the morning,&quot; a trader for a brokerage house said.</p>
<p>A city bank trader, said, however, that the reaction of overseas financial markets to the G7 would have to be seen in order to properly assess the G7's impact on the market.  </p>
<p>The dollar fell to just over 120 yen after the weekend G7 meeting signalled its strong desire for stability in currency rates.</p>
<p>The dollar rose off those levels in Tokyo trade, and was stalled just under 123 yen in late Tokyo.</p>
<p>Traders said they saw the key December Euroyen futures contract moving in a range of around 99.25 to 99.30 in the near term.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan injected 500 billion yen into the money market on Monday morning, maintaining its neutral stance.  </p>
<p>Traders said the key overnight call rate was mostly traded at 0.49 percent on Monday, which was likely to be the weighted average for the day.</p>
<p>On Friday, the weighted average of the key overnight call rate was 0.48 percent.</p>
<p>Traders said the rise in the rate was due to increased fund demand on a bond settlement day. Domestic bond other than JGBs are settled on fixed dates: the 10th and 20th of each month and the final business day.</p>
<p>About 25 billion yen worth of the key three-month certificates of deposit were issued at 0.54 percent.</p>
