<p>Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., builder of the Candu reactor used in Argentina, South Korea, Romania and Canada, moved on Thursday to limit damage from a devastating report on Ontario's once-vaunted nuclear plants.</p>
<p>Ontario government-owned Ontario Hydro, North America's largest power utility, unveiled on Wednesday a multi-billion dollar overhaul of its troubled nuclear power operations, including a shutdown of seven Candu nuclear units.</p>
<p>The overhaul is expected to cost up to C$8 billion ($5.7 billion) over the next five years, starting this year.</p>
<p>AECL, owned by the federal government, is the designer and builder of the nine Candu reactors now in operation or under construction in Romania, Argentina, South Korea, and China.</p>
<p>In Canada, 22 Candu reactors are in use in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.</p>
<p>&quot;The reports out of Ontario Hydro are certainly not welcome news. Troubles in any nuclear utility are unwelcome news for the nuclear business in general,&quot; Gary Kugler, AECL vice-president of commercial operations, said in a telephone interview on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said AECL representatives were already in contact with customers in Argentina, China, South Korea and Turkey.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to explain to our clients and prospective clients that we continue to be confident of Candu technology,&quot; Kugler said.</p>
<p>The shakeup followed a scathing report that said the nuclear division suffered from a &quot;lack of authoritative and accountable managerial leadership&quot; and concluded the performance of the five nuclear plants was &quot;minimally acceptable&quot; for a North American nuclear operation.</p>
<p>But it said the Candu reactor was a &quot;robust&quot; design and plant hardware was &quot;adequately reliable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question we have our work cut out for us to explain this to our offshore customers. When you buy a nuclear reactor you're buying a 40 or 50-year marriage,&quot; said Murray Stewart, president of the Canadian Nuclear Association, a group representing reactor makers, uranium producers, utilities and government.</p>
<p>Kugler said he expected competitors to take advantage of Ontario Hydro's nuclear woes in the bidding for overseas contracts.</p>
<p>AECL is bidding for a contract in Turkey and additional deals in Romania and South Korea. It also is eying Asia for possible sales.</p>
<p>Last fall, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien signed a C$4 billion ($2.9 billion) deal during a trade mission to China. The sale was criticized by environmentalists because it was not subject to an environmental assessment despite C$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) in Canadian financing.</p>
<p>After Wednesday's report, some environmental groups demanded that nuclear power be phased out in Canada. Aside from concern over disposing of nuclear waste and radioactive containment leaks, the groups said the cost had been too high.</p>
