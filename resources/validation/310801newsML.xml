<p>TransTexas Gas Corp said Thursday directors are considering the spin off of its services division, known as SouthWest Texas Services.</p>
<p>The company said preliminary estimates put the value of such a spin off in the range of $100 million, adding it is considering a plant that would include a cash distribution to TransTexas equity holders as part of the use of proceeds.</p>
<p>TransTexas said it believes a spin-off, which would be subject to lenders approval, would more accurately reflect the unit's value versus the current price accorded within the stock of TransTexas.  </p>
<p>SouthWest Texas Services provides a full complement of oil and natural gas field services throughout the South Texas area.</p>
<p>TransTexas said it is discussing financing of the entity with investment advisors to expand both the scope and size of the services that it currently provides, so as to rapidly commence operations for third-parties.</p>
<p>SouthWest Texas Services has a fleet of 25 drilling rigs, eight workover rigs, 26 fracturing pumping units, six cementing units, five logging units and about 1,200 employees.  </p>
<p>The company said its strategy for the service unit is to expand its fleet of equipment and coverage area to include Northeastern Mexico.</p>
<p>TransTexas further said it has had extensive discussions with Petroleos Mexicanos to examine the feasibility of a technology and operating agreement that could allow SouthWest Texas Services to provide oil field services in Mexico.</p>
<p>Pemex is expected to increase operational activity in areas bordering TransTexas' Lobo Trend and Bob West North natural gas fields, the company noted.</p>
<p>The company also said it has hired two oil field veterans to run the services unit.</p>
<p>Haraldur Karlsson was named president and Jack McNulty was named as vice president of marketing and business development, TransTexas said.</p>
<p>Company officials were not immediately available to elaborate on the TransTexas statement, which did not say who had previously held these positions.</p>
