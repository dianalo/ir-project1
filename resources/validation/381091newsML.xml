<p>The South African Air Force (SAAF) said on Sunday that 17 people endangered by rising flood waters in neighbouring Mozambique had been evacuated and that airdrops were being made of fresh water and fuel.</p>
<p>Mozambique's second largest city Beira was cut off and thousands of people were forced to flee their homes after heavy flooding in Manhica and Sofala provinces.</p>
<p>A South Africa Air Force Caravan aircraft was deployed on Friday to make a survey of the flooded areas. Two helicopters were deployed later.</p>
<p>&quot;The area west of Beira is the hardest hit by the floods and a lot of rain is coming from Malawi, which is causing the rivers to flood,&quot; SAAF spokeswoman Laverne Machine said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Communications are poor between the helicopters and the command post and all that has been established is the 17 people whose lives were in danger have been evacuated. This number can increase,&quot; Machine said.</p>
<p>A C130 Hercules transport aircraft on Sunday dropped 6,500 litres of fuel and 3,000 litres of water to the helicopter crews in Mozambique's Caia area, which was inaccessible by road due to the flood waters, she said.</p>
<p>A Mozambican helicopter also began operating on Friday in the Zambezi valley to seek out any people who might have been isolated by the flood waters and lift them to safety.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi overflew the flood areas on Friday, and said that the top priority was to save lives.</p>
<p>&quot;We must identify the areas where there are people surrounded by water,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;They must be immediately evacuated to safer places.&quot;</p>
<p>Mozambique's Foreign Minister, Leonardo Simao, requested South Africa's help on Friday, saying local authorities could not cope.</p>
<p>The Beira-Zimbabwe road is cut off by the Pungue river floods. But vehicles that urgently need to make the journey can do so by catching a train.</p>
<p>Mozambique Railways has said it is laying on a daily train service between Dondo and Tica specifically to carry vehicles across the flooded area.</p>
