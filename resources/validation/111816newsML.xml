<p>German construction company Philipp Holzmann AG, which dived to losses in 1995 after huge write-downs on real estate projects, confirmed on Friday an earlier forecast that it would break even in 1996.</p>
<p>Shares in Holzmann rose 15 marks ($9.81) to 360 as the builder also announced that an auditor's report into events behind the 458 million marks of write-downs had cleared its management of any &quot;violation of duty&quot;.</p>
<p>Holzmann last week saw its shares fall to 330 marks on media reports, both denied, that it faced liquidity problems and that its chief executive Lothar Mayer faced the sack over the property write-downs.</p>
<p>Holzmann said in a statement on Friday that the group restructuring programme annnounced in June to boost its earnings potential would be completed by the end of 1997, as orginally planned.</p>
<p>&quot;The board expects a break-even result in the current business year,&quot; Holzmann said, confirming a forecast made with its interim results earlier this year.</p>
<p>The group shocked investors last year by announcing losses of 443 million marks, compared to a profit of 120 million marks in 1994, as a result of the write-downs on property risks.</p>
<p>Holzmann said its orders in hand for the first eight months of the year were up 16.6 percent at 15.77 billion marks.</p>
<p>Analysts said Holzmann shares had risen largely as a correction of the movement last week, with some still sceptical about the overall health of the construction sector and the company's ability to make earnings progress within it.</p>
<p>One analyst also noted that while the report by auditors KPMG had cleared the management board of any wrong-doing in relation to the losses for property write-downs, it did not go much further in its endorsement of the management.</p>
<p>Holzmann last week denied a radio report suggesting that it had liquidity problems and that its banks had cut its credit lines. It said its financial projections were based on having sufficient liquidity for 1996 and 1997.</p>
<p>It also rejected as speculation a report that Mayer's job was under threat and that Kajo Neukirchen, management board chairman of industrial group Metallgesellschaft AG, was being seen as a possible successor.</p>
