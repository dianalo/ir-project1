<p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Palestinian negotiators on Monday who said that headway had been made to break a peace deadlock over Hebron before Christmas.</p>
<p>&quot;There is progress,&quot; Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, told reporters after meeting Netanyahu. The Israeli leader then left for talks on Hebron with his senior ministers</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting was held in a positive atmosphere and both sides expressed their willingess to move forward,&quot; Netanyahu's office said in a statement.</p>
<p>PLO officials said Abbas would convey a letter to Arafat from Netanyahu, but they did not say what it contained. They said discussions between the sides continued to clinch a deal.</p>
<p>In the West bank town of Hebron, an Israeli truck took camp beds and equipment from the military governor's office but officials declined to say whether final preparations for a long-delayed troop redeployment were under way.</p>
<p>Only six military vehicles were left at the office, the nerve centre of Israel's military occupation of Hebron since 1967, reporters said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu had joined talks with Palestinians while U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross flew to Cairo to brief Egypt, a key player in efforts to reach a deal on an Israeli pullback in Hebron. Ross was due to return to Israel later on Monday.</p>
<p>Ross said the sides were edging closer to an agreement. Speaking in Cairo after talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Ross said:</p>
<p>&quot;It is more feasible now. It's a possibility but not a final thing. The negotiators are working hard. The issues are being discussed but nothing final has been drafted.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier, Palestinian officials said there was agreement on some major disputed points, but other issues were left to be resolved in a meeting yet to be arranged between Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.</p>
<p>Arafat himself said a meeting might take place on Monday night.</p>
<p>Ross, who arrived in the Middle East on Saturday saying he hoped to re-energise talks, had played down hopes of a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Israel and the PLO have accused each other of foot-dragging in more than three months of talks on Hebron, 80 percent of which was due to have been handed over to Arafat's Palestinian Authority months ago.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who came to power in June vowing to take a tough line on Israeli security, has demanded protection for 400 Jewish militants in the heart of the city of 100,000 Arabs, a longtime flashpoint of violence between Arabs and Jews.</p>
<p>PLO officials said the Israelis had dropped their insistence on having the right of hot pursuit of Palestinian suspects into PLO-held areas, accepting instead existing language in the Hebron handover agreement signed in 1995.</p>
<p>One PLO official said agreement had also been reached to reopen Martyrs Street in the heart of town within four months. It has been closed to Palestinians. It was also agreed to reopen the long-closed vegetable market so long as it was a retail rather than a wholesale market.</p>
<p>&quot;As for resumption of further redeployments from the West Bank and resumption of final-status talks, there was an initial agreement to set a date for these two issues 'within weeks', and this would have to be determined in a meeting between Netanyahu and Arafat,&quot; the official said.</p>
