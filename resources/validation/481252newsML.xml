<p>A regular passenger ferry from Italy docked at Albania's main port on Wednesday for the first time since violence swept the country last month and foreigners were evacuated in panic from the Durres quays.</p>
<p>Scores of police armed with assault rifles surrounded the Adriatic port on Wednesday, where thousands of Albanians rioted in mid-March while trying desperately to force their way onto the evacuation ships.</p>
<p>Police roadblocks were set up at main entrances to the port town on Wednesday, cars were searched for weapons and some people were body-searched.</p>
<p>At the main gate police, including one in cowboy boots and brandishing a Kalashnikov, broke up even small gatherings of people quickly to make sure there was no trouble.</p>
<p>But the Greek-owned ferry Illyria docked without incident, bringing 80 people, mostly Albanians, and commercial trucks from Brindisi. It was the first sign the port was firmly back under government control and functioning again.</p>
<p>&quot;There were no problems. It was an easy voyage. We had regular passengers with passports and visas. There were no refugees aboard,&quot; captain Theodoros Ioannou told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Illyria was the first regular scheduled boat to dock in three weeks, port officials said.</p>
<p>Some commercial trucks involved in Italian-Albanian trade arrived with the Illyria from Brindisi.</p>
<p>&quot;We brought in a load of cola extract for our processing plant near Tirana,&quot; said Francesco De Candia, director of the Coca-Cola Company in Albania.</p>
<p>De Candia met the cargo with two carloads of heavily-armed security men to accompany the load on the 30 kms (20 mile) trip to the Albanian capital of Tirana.</p>
<p>Albania has been swept by violence for three months and a popular uprising in early March left most of the south outside of government control.</p>
<p>Armed gangs have roamed the south, robbing, looting and terrorising residents. Army and police fled in the face of the March uprising, leaving the region at the mercy of the gangs.</p>
<p>The Illyria was loading nine cars and about 30 small trucks for the return trip to Brindisi.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to come every day now. For us the service has been reestablished,&quot; Ioannou said in between shouting at drivers as he directed cars aboard the ferry.</p>
<p>But he said the Illyria was skipping its usual stop at the rebel-held port of Vlore further to the south.</p>
<p>An Italian-led multinational force is set to deploy soon in Durres and Vlore to protect humanitarian relief. The security force's presence will help ensure the safety of private ships.</p>
<p>Most trucks carried clothing, part of the profitable trade with Italy which has flourished since 45 years of Stalinism and self-imposed isolation from the West crumbled in 1990.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the first cargo of clothing we've sent in a month,&quot; said Alma Xhaxho, who works for the Blu Style company. &quot;The crisis in Albania is killing our business. We're hopelessly behind in all our delivery schedules.&quot;</p>
<p>Blu Style imports the textiles from Italy and assembles the clothing in Albania. It then exports finished products to Italy for sale. Wednesday's cargo had a value of eight million lira.</p>
<p>A truck from the Pool Albania company was sending 17,199 shoes to Italy, Edmond Mimo said. The shoes would be fitted with soles in Italy and then sold.</p>
<p>&quot;This crisis is killing our business but we're a small firm and can adapt quickly to almost any situation -- as long as the port is kept open,&quot; he said.</p>
