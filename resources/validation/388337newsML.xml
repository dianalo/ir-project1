<p>The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down restrictions that keep demonstrators 15 feet away from women visiting abortion clinics, saying that particular effort to curb aggressive anti-abortion protests goes too far.</p>
<p>The high court by an 8-1 vote said a local judge's order that created a floating, 15-foot space around people and automobiles entering and leaving the abortion clinics violated the protesters' constitutional free-speech rights.</p>
<p>But in a second part of the decision, the court by a 6-3 vote reaffirmed that judges may impose separate fixed restrictions that keep demonstrators 15 feet from the clinic doorways, driveways and entrances.</p>
<p>Writing for the high court majority, Chief Justice William Rehnquist said those restrictions were necessary to ensure access to the clinic for abortion-seeking women.</p>
<p>Anti-abortion groups hailed the decision as a major victory for free-speech rights while abortion rights groups predicted it will have little impact on the right and ability of women to obtain an abortion.</p>
<p>Blocking access to abortion clinics has been a popular tactic of militant factions within the anti-abortion movement, often leading to violent clashes around the country. Abortion has been a basic right of American women since a landmark Supreme Court ruling on the issue in 1973.</p>
<p>Concerned about the violence, President Bill Clinton in 1994 signed a law that makes it a federal crime to obstruct an abortion clinic or to interfere with patients or staff.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has struggled in recent years with defining exactly what limits may be imposed on protesters without violating constitutional free-speech rights.</p>
<p>Rehnquist said the &quot;floating buffer zones&quot; requiring that &quot;sidewalk counsellors&quot; stay 15 away from anyone who does not want to talk to them was unconstitutional, burdening speech more than necessary to serve the government's interest.</p>
<p>He explained in the 26-page ruling that those limits prevented the demonstrators from communicating a message from a normal conversational distance or from handing out leaflets on public sidewalks.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a broad prohibition, both because of the type of speech that is restricted and the nature of the location,&quot; he said. &quot;Leafletting and commenting on matters of public concern are classic forms of speech that lie at the heart of the First Amendment (to the U.S. Constitution).&quot;</p>
<p>But Rehnquist said the court was not deciding that all zones of separation between protesters and individuals would be illegal. He said the court only was addressing the one at issue involving two abortion clinics in upstate New York.</p>
<p>The restrictions had been imposed by a federal judge in 1992 because protesters previously engaged in a campaign to harass abortion-seeking women and obstruct access to the clinics in Buffalo and Rochester.</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy, dissented, saying all the restrictions should be struck down. &quot;Today's opinion makes a destructive inroad&quot; upon First Amendment law, Scalia said.</p>
<p>Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for the anti-abortion protesters in the case, said the court had &quot;sent a resounding message that you cannot silence a message you disagree with.&quot;</p>
<p>Martha Davis, legal director of the NOW Legal Defence Fund, which represented the clinics, expressed disappointment that the court struck down the so-called floating zones, but noted they have not been imposed that often.</p>
<p>She said she was enouraged the court reaffirmed its 1994 ruling allowing fixed restrictions on how close demonstrators can get to clinics.</p>
<p>The ruling was a setback for the Clinton Justice Department, which had defended all of the restrictions.</p>
