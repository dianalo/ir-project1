<p>Hong Kong stocks rose on Friday and other Asian markets put in a mixed performance, with many participants still away and others looking to Wall Street for direction.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed 19.35 points or 0.15 percent higher at 13,222.79 after seesawing within a 100-point band.</p>
<p>&quot;The market looks like it has stabilised,&quot; said Anthony Mak, associate director at Vickers Ballas. &quot;But we could see it dip to 13,000 if there is further weakness on Wall Street.&quot;</p>
<p>Overnight the Dow Jones industrial index fell sharply in early trading but managed to cut losses by the close, ending down 5.78 points at 6,442.49.</p>
<p>Nervous investors fear recent data showing a robust economy could signal a resurgence of inflation, followed by higher interest rates that would undermine soaring share valuations.</p>
<p>The Tokyo market remained closed for holidays.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the key Straits Times Industrials Index ended up 7.29 points or 0.33 percent at 2,224.08. A dealer said there was renewed concern about a U.S. rate hike at the Federal Reserve's next Open Market Committee meeting on February 4-5.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dow might be affected if there is any rate hike. So today's trade is dominated by a very cautious, wait-and-see attitude,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Composite index rose 8.09 points or 1.27 percent to close at 646.19 points.</p>
<p>Brokers said they had initially expected the market to remain slow, but a spurt of buying in stocks of large-capitalized companies in late trading boosted sentiment and prompted further buying in small-caps as well.</p>
<p>Thai stocks finished sharply lower for the third straight session as investors continued showing jitters about weak economic indicators and talk of loan defaults faced by financial institutions, brokers said.</p>
<p>The SET index ended 15.66 points or 1.95 percent lower at a near 52-month low of 787.47. The index last closed lower on September 9, 1992 at 782.85.</p>
<p>The Australian share market closed lower after a volatile Wall Street kept local investors nervous. The All Ordinaries index was 11.7 points or 0.49 percent lower at 2,399.5.</p>
<p>Crude oil futures fell in Asia. February Brent on SIMEX traded down to a low of $24.05, down 17 cents from London's settlement overnight.</p>
<p>Hong Kong gold ended down from the previous New York close. Bullion ended at US$365.00/50 an ounce against New York's US$365.25/75 close on Thursday.</p>
<p>At 1115 GMT the dollar was trading at 115.60/70 yen and 1.5473/78 marks.</p>
