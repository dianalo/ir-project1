<p>U.S. stocks were slightly lower at midday, but firmer than bonds, as worry about the future of the economy and interest rates prevailed in the marketplace.</p>
<p>&quot;Bonds are dragging stocks lower here. The indexes are performing surprisingly well, but in the underlying broader market, there's not much strength there,&quot; said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer for Waddell &amp; Reed.</p>
<p>The Dow Industrials were off about 11 to 6257 after erasing most of an earlier 30 point deficit.  </p>
<p>The initial losses were triggered just after the opening of trading by strong housing starts data. November starts jumped 9.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.514 million units in November, far above Wall Street economists' forecasts for a 1.39 million rate.</p>
<p>The long bond was off 20/32 to yield 6.68 percent, knocked lower by the strong economic data which prompted some fears about today's meeting of the the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy-setting committee. But most analysts said they did not expect the FOMC panel to take any action at the meeting.</p>
<p>Results of the meeting are expected at 1415 EST/1915 GMT.  </p>
<p>&quot;With the stronger than expected numbers, there is some skittishness around. The general consensus is that they will do nothing ... but I'm not sure that even that will give the market a lot of comfort,&quot; Herrmann said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have some names holding the (indexes) up like GE and Intel and Microsoft, which have very heavy weightings but breadth looks negative,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shares of General Electric were helping boost the Dow with the stock up 1-1/8 to 96-3/8 after analysts were comforted by comments made by the company's chairman and chief executive Jack Welch.  </p>
<p>Microsoft Corp rose 1-5/8 to 78-3/8 and Intel Corp rose 1-7/16 to 128-3/8, lending some strength to the Nasdaq Composite Index. The index, heavily weighted with technology stocks, fell sharply on Monday in its biggest drop since July. It was off about four to 1257 at midday.</p>
<p>Peggy Farley, chief executive of Amas Securities, said she was using the drop in tech stocks as a buying opportunity.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is just in the doldrums, because there's not much faith that it will resume upwards. There's a question about what fourth quarter earnings will look like and people are looking further out and wondering about 1997,&quot; she said.  </p>
<p>She said she expected the market to gain towards the end of the year as investors deployed their cash and because of the buying opportunities still presented by dips in the market.</p>
<p>Among special situations, Home Depot shares jumped 1-1/4 to 49-5/8 after Prudential raised the stock's rating.</p>
<p>Frontier Corp shares plunged 6-1/4 to 20-1/8 in heavy trading after the telecommunications holding company warned of weak fourth quarter earnings.</p>
