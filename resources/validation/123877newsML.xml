<headline>NY Gov wins more labor approval for Green Bond Act.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>New York Gov. George Pataki, who has had a strained relationship with some state and city labor unions, said Thursday he had won the support of one of the biggest groups for the Green Bond Act.</p>
<p>New York State AFL-CIO and New York City AFL-CIO, which had raised safety and wage concerns about the projects that would be funded by the $1.75 billion environmental bond, resolved these questions in their talks with Pataki.</p>
<p>&quot;Workers across the state should know that when the bond act passes, all bond act projects will pay prevailing wages and that rigorous programs to protect their health and safety will be in place,&quot; said the governor, in prepared remarks.</p>
<p>A spokesman for New York City AFL-CIO, which has 1.5 million of the AFL-CIO's 2.5 million members in New York State, said he believed this was the first time that a bond act promised workers they would get the prevailing wage.</p>
<p>More than than 90 percent of the money raised by the bond offering is expected to be used for capital projects, creating nearly 60,000 jobs for construction workers, as well as &quot;tens of thousands&quot; permanant jobs, labor officials said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the state AFL-CIO said the union hoped the governor's willingness to find satisfy their concerns might signal the start of a smoother relationship. &quot;We are hopeful that what happened today will lead us to common ground on other issues,&quot; said Mario Cilento.</p>
<p>While he declined to disclose any new issues dividing the two sides, he noted that the union sharply disagreed with the workers' compensation reforms that Pataki secured this summer.</p>
<p>Despite the unions' endorsement, which echoed support already voiced by other labor groups, a new opponent of the bond act, which voters will approve or reject at the November 5 polls, weighed into the fight.</p>
<p>Walter Wriston, a retired chairman of Citicorp, which helped rescue New York City from its debt crisis in the mid-1970s, wrote Pataki, saying he disapproved adding new debt to the state's &quot;already staggering&quot; total of $65 billion.</p>
<p>In the letter, released by CHANGE-NY, which has criticized the bond act, Wriston added he supported the pay-as-you-go approach advanced by the Majority Leader of the Assembly, Michael Bragman, D-Syracuse.</p>
<p>CHANGE-NY, a taxpayers' association, also has praised the bill proposed by Bragman as an alternative to the bond act.</p>
<p>The former bank chairman said Bragman's proposal was more targeted than the act proposed by the governor, which included items such as zoos, parking lots, and operating expenses, like employee salaries. &quot;Indeed, some of these items in the act bring to mind some of the ploys used by the City of New York, which helped create the debt crisis,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pataki, a Republican, has denied that the $1.75 billion bond act would pay for questionable projects, saying it was a clearly focused act. The state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, who is a Democrat, has said that raising funds with the bond act is the only way voters can be ensured the money is used for its intended purposes.</p>
<p>McCall, who supports the bond act and is viewed as potential candidate for governor, has said that interest on the state's debt totals around $2.8 billion. This is less than 10 percent of New York State's operating budget and in line with most other states, according to the state comptroller.</p>
<p>The former top Citicorp official also argued that in its $66 billion budget, the state should be able to find the roughly $120 million a year that would needed to finance a pay-as-you-go plan at the same level that the money would be made available under the bond act.</p>
<p>However, officials with the Campaign for the Bond Act have said the act would spend approximately $900 million over the first five years, adding that a pay-as-you-go approach would delay clean-up projects, and thus make them more costly.</p>
