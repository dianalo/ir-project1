<p>Australian iron ore output is seen rising less than one percent in the 1996/97 year, but improved prices are expected to result in record iron ore export earnings in 1997, the government's commodity forecaster said.</p>
<p>Australian iron ore production is expected to rise by only 1.3 million or 0.9 percent to 149 million tonnes in the year to June 30, 1997, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) said in its September quarter report.</p>
<p>The 1996/97 output is seen held back by a relatively high level of inventory build-up during 1995/96 as exports fell by 2.4 million tonnes on the previous year's level, ABARE said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Continued growth in iron ore demand in the Asian region and a return to positive demand growth in Western Europe and Japan late in 1996 and throughout 1997 are expected to lead to an increase in Australian iron ore exports,&quot; ABARE said.</p>
<p>ABARE forecast exports to rise by seven million tonnes to 133.5 million tonnes, valued at A$3.1 billion in 1996/97.</p>
<p>The bureau said world iron ore prodution is forecast to rise by eight million tonnes to 1.03 billion tonnes in 1996, primarily in response to increased demand from blast furnace based steel producers in China and other Asian nations.  </p>
<p>&quot;These demand increases are expected to more than offset reduced demand from Japan and Western Europe, and are likely to place upward pressure on iron ore contract prices for 1997/98 (Japanese fiscal year),&quot; ABARE said.</p>
<p>ABARE said in 1997, stronger growth in blast furnace steel production in all major regions is expected to lift iron ore output by 22 million tonnes to a forecast 1.06 billion tonnes.</p>
<p>Increased iron ore demand is expected to be largely met by higher exports from Australian and Brazilian producers, it said.</p>
<p>The bureau forecast Australian steel output to rise by three percent to 8.9 million tonnes in 1996/97.  </p>
<p>The higher Australian steel export is due to increased demand in domestic and export markets, ABARE said.</p>
<p>The current weakness in Asian steel markets is expected to turn around in late 1996, leading Australian steel exports to rise by an estimated 4.8 percent to 3.3 million tonnes in 1996/97, the bureau said.</p>
<p>ABARE said export earnings are forecast to rise by 7.5 percent to A$1.62 billion in 1996/97 with a modest appreciation of the Australian dollar partly offsetting the benefits of increased export volumes.  </p>
<p>World steel production is forecast to rise by 12 million tonnes to 758 million tonnes in 1997 in response to rising demand generated by increased world economic growth, ABARE said.</p>
<p>Demand in Asia is expected to provide most of the impetus for higher steel production in 1996.</p>
<p>Production growth is expected to be more widespread in 1997, with significant rises  in output in all major steel producing regions, the bureau said.</p>
<p>&quot;These increases are expected to place upward pressure on prices for steelmaking raw materials in 1997,&quot; ABARE said.  </p>
