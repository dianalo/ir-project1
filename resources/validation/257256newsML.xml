<p>England captain Mike Atherton insisted England's one-day defeat to Zimbabwe would make no difference to his side's preparations for the first test starting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I've said all along it's a different form of the game,&quot; said Atherton, attempting to limit the damage caused by his side's poor batting efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;Zimbabwe are a well equipped one day side, but they are limited at test level. The bottom line is that we need our batsmen to get bigger scores&quot;.</p>
<p>Referring to England's record of three losses in four starts against the part-timers, he admitted: &quot;They're a bit of a jinx for us. But there are two games left and I'm confident we can turn it round.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very difficult to win a one-day international when you've only scored 150, but we bowled well and fielded witb a lot of imagination and skill.</p>
<p>&quot;I fancied our chances all the way through, but in the end we had to use up too many overs from our main bowlers to be competitive at the end. I knew we would have to bowl them out to win and that's what we tried to do.&quot;</p>
<p>Atherton felt the pitch was difficult to score fluently on, but Zimbabwe player/coach Dave Houghton suggested the home side deserved more credit. &quot;Their batsmen have been here long enough now to find their feet, but we field well and bowl a constricting line.&quot;</p>
