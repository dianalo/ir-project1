<title>USA: IMC-Agrico in phosphate rock exchange deal.</title>

<p>IMC-Agrico Co., a fertilizer joint venture between IMC Global Inc and Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners LP, said Monday they agreed to exchange phosphate rock reserves in central Florida with CF Industries Inc.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, IMC-Agrico will receive 7.2 million tons of developed and permitted phosphate rock reserves located near its Payne Creek Mine. In return, CF will receive more than 20 million tons of unpermitted and undeveloped reserves adjacent to its Hardee Mine.  </p>
<p>The deal is subject to approval by the parties' boards of directors.</p>
<p>IMC-Agrico said this cashless transaction enables it to extend the life of its Payne Creek Mine by nearly three years. Prior to this agreement, Payne Creek was scheduled to be shut down permanently before the end of 1997 due to depleted reserves.</p>
<p>&quot;The additional years of mining at Payne Creek also will permit IMC-Agrico to defer more than $70 million in capital expenditures that were used to develop Payne Creek's replacement,&quot; said Richard Block, president of IMC-Agrico.  </p>
<p>&quot;Moreover, IMC-Agrico will be better positioned to minimize its rock inventories and further reduce its operating costs,&quot; he added in a statement.</p>
<p>IMC-Agrico said it also will temporarily close its Noralyn and Clear Springs phosphate mining operations near Bartow, Fla., on October 6. On the same date, the Phosphoria Mine, located southwest of Bartow, will be closed permanently due to depletion of its phosphate reserves.</p>
<p>The closure of the Noralyn, Clear Springs and Phosphoria mines follow the temporary closure of Payne Creek on June 30.</p>
<p>All of the mine closures are consistent with the inventory reduction and cost control benefits associated with extending the life of the Payne Creek mine, Block added.</p>
<p>IMC-Agrico said the mine shutdowns are expected to last up to two years for Payne Creek and approximately seven months for Noralyn and Clear Springs. They will result in a work force reduction of about 270.</p>
<p>The company's other four mines continue to operate at full capacity.</p>
