<title>JAPAN: Japan to expand spent nuclear fuel storage space.</title>

<p>Local governments in Japan have approved two  firm's plans to increase storage capacity for spent nuclear fuel,  easing the nation's acute tightness in storage space, company spokesmen  said on Friday.</p>
<p>Swelling stockpiles of spent nuclear fuel have been a cause of growing  concern among local communities and government officials searching  for sites to relocate the toxic material.</p>
<p>The firms which won approval are Kansai Electric Power Co Inc and  Japan Atomic Power Co.</p>
<p>Kansai received approval to expand the capacity of its temporary storage  facilities at its Oi nuclear power plant in Fukui prefecture by 1,060  tonnes to 2,284 tonnes by March 2002.</p>
<p>The plant, along the Sea of Japan coast, currently holds 370 tonnes  of spent fuel and was expected to run out of storage space by around  2002, a Kansai Electric spokesman said.</p>
<p>Japan Atomic was granted permission to gradually expand its storage  capacity at the Tsuruga plant, also in Fukui, by 520 tonnes to 1,210  tonnes over two years beginning in October 1998.</p>
<p>The Tsuruga plant was expected to run short of storage space as early  as 2000, a company spokesman said.</p>
<p>Spent fuel from Japanese nuclear power plants had originally been  scheduled to be shipped beginning this spring to a new storage facility  at the Rokkashomura nuclear complex in northern Japan's Aomori prefecture.</p>
<p>There the spent fuel would be processed in order to extract reusable  remnants of uranium and plutonium from nuclear waste.</p>
<p>But the plan has been derailed since an explosion in March at a separate  nuclear fuel reprocessing plant that exposed 37 workers to low levels  of radiation.</p>
<p>The explosion at the Tokaimura plant, 110 kilometres northeast of  Tokyo, prompted Aomori government officials to halt talks with the  operator of the Rokkashomura complex until the cause of the Tokaimura  incident could be determined.</p>
<p>The Science and Technology Agency, which is leading the probe, said  it is still unclear when the Tokaimura investigation will be concluded.  -- Kiyoshi Takenaka (Tokyo Energy Desk +81-3-3432-8837)</p>
