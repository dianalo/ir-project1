<p>The likelihood that U.S. economy will fall into recession next year is a &quot;long shot&quot; because of the prospect of continued low inflation, Nicholas Perna, chief economist of Fleet Financial Group Inc, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The region is in the best shape it has been in since the late 1980s,&quot; Perna said in his outlook on economic conditions in the northeastern United States and the country as a whole.  </p>
<p>&quot;The only significant risk to the region would be a national recession, which I still believe will be a long shot in 1997, mainly because of the low rate of inflation expected,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>U.S. unemployment is expected to rise to 5.6 percent in 1997 with gross domestic product growth of two percent and the consumer price index rising about 3.3 percent.</p>
<p>U.S. unemployment was 5.4 percent in November 1996, while gross domestic product rose 2.1 percent in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The 12-month period ended November showed an increase in the consumer price index of 3.3 percent, but final figures for 1996 have not yet been reported.</p>
<p>Perna expects interest rates to be stable next year, with the prime rate expected to remain at about 8.25 percent.</p>
<p>For 1997, the Northeast economy should continue to experience growth in jobs and income in 1997. Perna sees job growth at 1.0 percent to 1.5 percent in the northeastern United States where Fleet operates.</p>
<p>Fleet said Perna provided the third-most accurate forecast for the U.S. economy's 1996 performance in a BusinessWeek survey of 50 economists.</p>
