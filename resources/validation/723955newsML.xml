<p>The increase in Japan's goods and services trade surplus is only temporary, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told reporters on Friday.  </p>
<p>The trend in the surplus in the goods and services trade is still on a declining trend, Mitsuzuka said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although I am not absolutely without worry, I see this as a temporary short-term fluctuation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The ministry announced on Wednesday that Japan's current account, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, rose 154.9 percent to 906.8 billion yen in May from a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Capital investment, consumption and housing construction are increasing, which shows that domestic demand is firm. The (rise in the) surplus will gradually become moderate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked about his views on the economy after the release of the government's monthly economic report, Mitsuzuka said: &quot;The report correctly indicates the direction the economy is heading.&quot;</p>
<p>The economy, despite a temporary slowdown, is continuing to recover, led by firm private demand, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said in its latest monthly report earlier on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the tempo of the recovery has temporarily slowed down, the economy is continuing to recover centring around firm private demand,&quot; the report said.</p>
