<p>England did a capable advance job for the bulldozers lined up to flatten Cardiff Arms Park at the end of the season by demolishing Wales 34-13 in another Five Nations record display on Saturday.</p>
<p>A four-try English surge in 23 minutes in the second-half allowed Phil de Glanville's side to secure their biggest away win in Cardiff to add to the scoring records they have set against Scotland and Ireland over the past two months.</p>
<p>It ensured fittingly handsome send-offs for former captain Will Carling and Rob Andrew, who appeared as a replacement for eight minutes at the end. Both can now walk into the test rugby sunset with another Triple Crown to add to their long list of career achievements.</p>
<p>France's 47-20 win over Scotland had ensured the title was out of England's reach before half-time, but their second-half performance made their demise two weeks ago from 20-6 up against France look more illogical than ever.</p>
<p>Tim Stimpson, Tony Underwood, Richard Hill and de Glanville all took full advantage of the increasing holes in an injury-hit Welsh side, also equalling England's highest total against their old opponents in 103 meetings.</p>
<p>It was scarcely the farewell either the Arms Park crowd or the retiring Jonathan Davies had envisaged and at half-time, like so many of England's games this season, an entirely different outcome looked possible.</p>
<p>The match was delicately poised with England just 6-3 ahead and forced into a reshuffle after two injury changes during the interval.</p>
<p>Hooker Mark Regan and winger Jon Sleightholme both had to depart early, but it was Wales, already without a third of their first-choice team, who were to crack first.</p>
<p>They had already lost Neil Jenkins, whose 50th appearance lasted only 15 minutes before he went off with a broken arm, having uncharacteristically missed with his first two penalty attempts, and prop Christian Loader soon followed.</p>
<p>It did not seem to affect them unduly in the first-half but once Stimpson scored his first try for England in the right corner in the 49th minute, their resolve started to ebb away.</p>
<p>Underwood capitalised on a loose ball to sprint 60 metres for the second try, while Hill and de Glanville were both assisted by the guile of Jeremy Guscott, one of nine replacements to take the field.</p>
<p>Guscott is already inked in as certainty to tour South Africa with the Lions and, after this result, he will not be short of English friends on the flight.</p>
<p>Their statistics in recent seasons are undeniable. This was their fifth Triple Crown in seven seasons and their season total of 141 points is a record aggregate for any country in Five Nations history.</p>
