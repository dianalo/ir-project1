<p>Brooklyn Union Gas Co. said Tuesday it will acquire a 24.5 percent stake in two subsidiaries of Britain's BG Plc that are developing a natural gas market in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Union subsidiary KeySpan International Ltd. will acquire the stake in Phoenix Natural Gas Ltd. and Premier Transco Ltd., said a joint statement from Brooklyn Union and BG Plc, formerly British Gas Plc.</p>
<p>Phoenix Natural Gas, which has already announced plans for a 160-million-pound ($261.2 million) investent in Northern Ireland, was awarded a license to develop a natural gas industry in the British province last year.</p>
<p>Supplies to its first industrial customber began last December. It will also supply domestic customers.</p>
<p>Premier Transco built and operates a pipeline linking Northern Ireland and Scotland.</p>
<p>Details of the acquisition costs were not disclosed.</p>
<p>&quot;We are delighted that a company of Brooklyn Union's international stature is joining us in the development of Northern Ireland's natural gas industry,&quot; said David Varney, chief executive of BG Plc.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Union Chairman Robert Catell said the joint venture fit perfectly with his company's long-term investment plans.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe natural gas will be the fuel of the future for Northern Ireland,&quot; said Catell, whose company also plans to merge with Long Island Lighting Co. to form a $4 billion electric and gas utility.</p>
<p>Tuesday's announcement was made at a news conference in Belfast attended by senior officials from both companies.</p>
<p>A BG Plc spokesman declined to say how much the acquisition cost. &quot;We are not able to go into details of the financial arrangements,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a possibility of further discussions with other potential joint venture partners. Clearly, we would not wish to compromise our negotiating position.&quot;</p>
