<p>French insurers' first-half results will show a big fall in property provisions but bottom-line performances will vary, insurance analysts say.</p>
<p>The past two years, marked by huge provisions to cover exposure to France's long-running real estate slump, were the &quot;nadir of the French composite insurers' earnings meltdown&quot;, said Salomon Brothers' insurance analyst Brian Shea.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a mixed bag of performances with results helping to differentiate companies on clear improving tracks from those with lingering problems,&quot; he said in an investment note.</p>
<p>Along with lower risk provisions, other features of the second half should be better returns from investment portfolios, resulting in a rise in adjusted net asset values.</p>
<p>Analysts expect good growth in the life market but say profit margins remain a key issue. A big improvement is expected in non-life earnings and banking losses are seen declining.</p>
<p>The best performer will be Axa, the lone insurer which was not hammered by exposure to the property downturn, analysts predict.</p>
<p>They say Axa, due to report its results on September 25, should further distance itself from its recovering peers with good earnings increases from several of its units. First half profits for Axa are expected to be around 1.6-1.7 billion francs against 1.3 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>AGF, privatised earlier this year, is expected to show its recovery is on track. Profits estimates for AGF, set to announce its results on September 19, range from 600 million francs to 750 million after last year's profit of 487 million. AGF's banking operations should sharply reduce their losses.</p>
<p>Some analysts expect UAP, privatised in 1994, to show a fall in first-half profit and analysts are uncertain about its future earnings power. &quot;It has clearly become a speculative stock,&quot; said Sami Gotrane of Paris brokerage EIFB.</p>
<p>UAP recorded a half-year profit last year of 806 million francs but then slid into the red, recording a 1995 loss of 2.07 billion francs because of massive provisions. Its results are due on October 9. Analysts expect a profit of around 750 million francs to 800 million but say the forecast is a best guess because of disposals.</p>
<p>&quot;They have worked through their debt problems and their real estate problems but they still have their work cut out to improve the profitability of their main business -- insurance,&quot; said Patrick Leguil of Paris brokerage Transbourse.</p>
<p>As negative factors for UAP, analysts cite weakness in its German arm Colonia and UK non-life earnings. But Banque Worms is expected to sharply reduce its losses.</p>
<p>State-controlled GAN, whose results are due next month, is expected to remain in the red, hit by provisioning costs for its real estate financing arm UIC.</p>
<p>Forecasts range from a loss of 200 to 300 million francs following last year's loss of 387 million. Analysts are sceptical it can attain its break-even target for 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The poor results recently published by UIC for H1 1996 -- a loss of 758 million francs -- will probably lead to a loss for GAN for the year,&quot; said Derek Elias of Paribas.</p>
<p>Axa will turn in the most solid performance, analysts say. Two of its subsidiaries, its U.S. unit Equitable and Australia's National Mutual have already announced their earnings. The Equitable will contribute a first half profit of 835 million francs versus 799 million last time around.</p>
<p>National Mutual, bought last year, but whose earnings were not consolidated in the first half, is expected to contribute 101 million francs to earnings against pro forma full year earnings of 125 million.</p>
<p>Axa's non-life earnings are also seen on track for a strong full year increase. Axa's British unit, Equity and Law, and reinsurance earnings are expected to show good improvements.</p>
