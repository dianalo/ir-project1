<p>* Latvia's struggling share market was still mired in the midsummer doldrums on Thursday in paltry turnover of 39,000 lats against 33,000 lats on Wednesday.</p>
<p>* On the official list, three stocks eased, one held steady and only Kaija fish cannery gained, inching up 0.9 percent to 2.19 lats.</p>
<p>* The Rietumu index shed 0.12 percent to 153.17 while the bourse index fell 0.32 percent to 382.96.</p>
<p>No red rags were in sight on Latvia's sluggish bourse on Thursday and dealers did not expect the bears to hibernate before the fall.</p>
<p>Turnover was a paltry 39,000 lats and the bourse index eased 0.32 percent to 382.96.</p>
<p>Three of the five official list stocks eased with only the Kaija fish factory gaining ground. It inched up to 2.17 lats from 2.15 lats in trade of 2,200 lats.</p>
<p>Unibanka held steady at 3.35 lats in trade of 8,400 lats.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was still wallowing after the four-day midsummer weekend.</p>
<p>It has also suffered from longer term factors.</p>
<p>Lacking big insitutional investors and largely insulated from trends elsewhere in the region and Europe, the market has failed to pull forcefully from a slump which set in after a January bull-run that analysts say was speculative.</p>
<p>The money that is out there is mostly being channeled into privatisation vouchers ahead of a spate of sell-offs of key state enterprises, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The vouchers will suck in a lot of the money, away from the bourse, until at least September,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>On a brighter note, dealers said the official list seemed to be stabilising despite the session's losses.</p>
<p>&quot;The official list appears to have stabilised,&quot; said Andreta Petersone, a broker with Hansabank-Latvija.</p>
<p>&quot;The Riga Transport Fleet (RTF) is down a bit, but its half-year results are expected to be good, so it shouldn't fall much more,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>RTF shed 3.3 percent to 1.19 lats on Thursday in trade of 2,500 lats.</p>
