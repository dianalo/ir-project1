<p>Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer said on Sunday the government had set up the structure for lower interest rates and the four rate cuts so far had led to a more realistic value of the Australian dollar.</p>
<p>Low inflation of around two percent and a budget surplus next year had not only made other OECD countries envious, but would also pave the way for a lower interest rate structure, Fischer said in a television interview on the Seven network.</p>
<p>Fischer, who is also Deputy Prime Minister in the Liberal-National coalition government, said the four official rate cuts since last July reflected this new structure and this had had a positive impact.</p>
<p>&quot;Also a more realistic value for the Australian dollar,&quot; Fischer said of the impact of the rate cuts.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cut official interest rates by 50 basis points on four occasions since last July.</p>
<p>The most recent cut on May 23 saw the official cash rate lowered to 5.50 percent, level with the U.S. Federal Funds rate, and financial markets are speculating on the possibility of a fifth Australian rate cut.</p>
<p>That speculation has seen the Australian dollar weaken against the U.S. dollar. From a six-year high of just above US$0.8200 in early December ahead of the third rate cut, the dollar has fallen to 16-month lows just above US$0.7500 last week as speculation of a fifth rate cut mounted.</p>
<p>Fischer would not comment on the possibility of another rate cut.</p>
<p>&quot;What I will say is that we are setting a responsible framework for the right kinds of decisions from the Reserve Bank because we've got the fiscal policy settings right, we're building to a sensible, positive surplus at the right time and that will help provide a lower interest rate structure,&quot; he said.</p>
