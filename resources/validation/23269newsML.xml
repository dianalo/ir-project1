<p>A hearing law suit launched by Indonesian democracy figurehead Megawati Sukarnoputri against the government and party rivals agreed on Thursday to hear the case after the parties failed to reach an out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;For the time being, an agreement has not been reached, so the suit will be read,&quot; head judge I Gde Ketut Sukarata told the packed court room at the Central Jakarta State Court.</p>
<p>The three member panel of judges then took turns at reading the plaintiffs suit and the defendants responses during the hour long hearing.</p>
<p>The case was then adjourned until September 5 when Megawati's legal team is expected to respond to the defendants statements.</p>
<p>Witnesses said supporters shouting &quot;Mega will win&quot; outside the court were peacefully dispersed by riot police after the hearing.</p>
<p>The case had opened just before 10.00 a.m. (0300 GMT) with the head of Megawati's legal team, R.O. Tambunan, telling the court the parties had been unable to come to an agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;We have held marathon meetings four times. The meetings were open and familiar in nature,&quot; Tambunan told the court.</p>
<p>There was no immediate reaction from Megawati supporters who were present.</p>
<p>&quot;We have tried hard but we regret to tell you that we did not come to an agreement even though we have tried. We hope that in the future we can try again, but for now I suggest that the case continues,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>About 500 people, including Megawati supporters, gathered outside the court, were closely watched by riot police and witnesses said traffic was blocked but the gathering was peaceful.</p>
<p>Megawati has sued the Interior Minister Yogie Memet, Armed Forces Chief Fiesal Tanjung and National Police Chief Lieutenant-General Dibyo Widodo as well as PDI party rivals Surjadi and his supporters.</p>
<p>She is seeking a court declaration that the government-backed PDI congress which was held in Medan in north Sumatra in June and elected Surjadi as party leader was illegal.</p>
<p>She is also seeking damages.</p>
