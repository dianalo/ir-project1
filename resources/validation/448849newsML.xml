<title>GERMANY: Continental devises flexible production.</title>
<headline>Continental devises flexible production.</headline>

<p>Germany's largest tyre maker, Continental AG, said on Monday it had devised a &quot;modular manufacturing process&quot; that would improve its competitiveness by slashing inventory and other overhead costs.</p>
<p>The process will allow the company to produce smaller lots of specialised tyres more flexibly, in response to an increasingly diversified market. The first plant to use the new scheme will go on stream in Germany this year.</p>
<p>&quot;This process will help us attain a worldwide presence, making it easier to enter new markets,&quot; chairman Hubertus von Gruenberg said in a statement.</p>
<p>Last month, in response to early media reports about the process, Continental said the new process would not cut its workforce in the near term, but would allow it to continue producing in high-cost locations in Europe.</p>
<p>The company has applied to patent the process, which will require little retooling or investment, and will save the company 50 million to 70 million marks a year.</p>
<p>Cash flow is likely to improve by about 100 million marks a year due to the lower inventories.</p>
<p>The new structure is aimed at more economical production, particularly of tyres made in smaller lots with volatile demand. The company will be able to respond to sudden changes in demand, due for example to the sudden onset of winter weather, in hours instead of weeks.</p>
<p>The company aims to use the process to produce between five and 10 million tires a year within a few years. Output in 1996 was about 46 million, without including the U.S.</p>
