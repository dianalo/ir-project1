<headline>U.S. seeks agriculture language in WTO communique.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>The United States will be pushing to have agriculture-specific language included in the final statement released from next week's World Trade Organization ministerial meeting in Singapore, the top U.S. agricultural official attending the meeting said Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that there will be some language in the communique that keeps agriculture (reform) on track,&quot; Deputy Agriculture Secretary Richard Rominger told Reuters in a phone interview from California before he departed for Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't have the specific language that we want in there, but that will be the sense of it,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Rominger said that Argentina has also requested that language ensuring a commitment to further agricultural reform under WTO be included in the group's final statement, and that Australia is also expected to push hard for the inclusion.</p>
<p>But the official said it could be a tough fight as some countries, particulary the European Union and Japan, will probably be against such language in the WTO statement.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure if we'll be able to succeed, as some parties are very against this,&quot; Rominger said.  </p>
<p>Rominger will be leading a large agriculture contingent, representing the administration, Congress, commodity and producer lobbying groups, and private food companies.</p>
<p>At last count, the entire U.S. delegation to the conference totalled 148, with at least 55 of those participants representing agricultural interests.</p>
<p>Rominger said the United States wants to ensure at the meeting that parties stick to the agenda laid out two years ago when the WTO was formed. He said some, specifically the EU, Japan and South Korea, are reluctant to go forward with more reform in their farm sectors.  </p>
<p>He said U.S. participants will also be urging that an exchange of information begins over the next two years, before the WTO begins to renegotiate agricultural issues in 1999, as it is committed to do.</p>
<p>A number of bilateral meetings between the United States and other parties will be held in Singapore, Rominger said. Discussions are likely with Canada, Australia and the EU.</p>
<p>Rominger said the United States will also be closely watching discussions over China's accession into the WTO. &quot;We want to make sure that China puts some meaningful concessions on the table&quot; before it joins the world trade body, he said.</p>
<p>Despite the big agricultural presence at the meeting and the obvious importance Washington is putting on it, Rominger was careful to say there will not likely be any major agreements reached at the conference.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a negotiating meeting, so I don't think there will be any kinds of major agreements reached at this meeting,&quot; Rominger said. &quot;For agriculture, it will be taking stock of where the process is and making sure that things are not slowed down.&quot;</p>
