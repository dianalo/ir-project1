<title>MONTSERRAT: Volcanic flow reaches heart of Montserrat capital.</title>
<headline>Volcanic flow reaches heart of Montserrat capital.</headline>
<dateline>OLVESTON, Montserrat 1997-08-04</dateline>

<p>Fires burned in Montserrat's abandoned capital on Monday as superheated rock, gas and ash from the island's unpredictable volcano flowed into the heart of Plymouth for the first time.</p>
<p>The fiery flow from the Soufriere Hills volcano torched the British colony's customs offices, a supermarket, a clothing store, a church and a dozen houses, but no one was hurt, government spokesman Richard Aspin said.</p>
<p>&quot;We were expecting it,&quot; Aspin said. &quot;But there's the distress of seeing buildings burning in the capital for the first time.&quot;</p>
<p>The heightened activity in the rumbling mountain was the worst since June 25, when pyroclastic flows of rock, gas and ash swept through several villages, killing 19 people.</p>
<p>Those were the first deaths attributed to the volcano since it roared to life in July 1995 after nearly four centuries of dormancy.</p>
<p>Plymouth, a once-bustling village of 5,000 and the heart of social life in the colony, has been abandoned for much of the past two years.</p>
<p>Residents in the island's south end, where the capital is located, were last evacuated to the northern &quot;safe zone&quot; in April 1996.</p>
<p>Since the volcanic activity began, the island's population has dropped from 11,000 to 5,200 as residents leave for Britain or neighbouring islands to find work and safer homes.</p>
<p>Three major pyroclastic flows swept down the mountain late on Sunday and early on Monday, sending tons of debris tumbling into Fort Ghaut, a river valley that runs through the heart of Plymouth, Aspin said. The hot rock and ash set a score of buildings on fire before reaching the sea. The fires were the first caused by the volcano in Plymouth.</p>
<p>&quot;We're letting them burn themselves out. It's too dangerous to go in,&quot; Aspin said.</p>
<p>A resident who ventured into the danger zone and was trapped by the flows was rescued by sea early on Monday, unharmed, he said.</p>
<p>The mountain belched clouds of ash, leaving thick dust in the air. Residents were cautioned to wear dust masks when they ventured outside.</p>
<p>Since the deaths on June 25, the situation is policing itself, Aspin said. &quot;People just don't go out anymore,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Richard Robertson, chief scientist at the Montserrat Volcano Observatory, said the latest pyroclastic flows were part of a pattern that volcano observers had seen before.</p>
<p>&quot;We are entering a period of elevated activity,&quot; he said, adding that the northern half of the island was still considered safe.</p>
<p>&quot;The north at the very most will be affected by ashfalls,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't see any major problems there, even with this new activity.&quot;</p>
<p>The volcano's dome, a giant pile of debris pushed up from the centre of the mountain, contained 2.72 billion cubic feet (77 million cubic metres) of material at last estimate, Robertson said.</p>
<p>Montserrat is an teardrop-shaped 11-by-7-mile (18-by-11-km) island in the eastern Caribbean.</p>
