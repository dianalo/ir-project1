<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian race row politician banned by hometown.</title>
<headline>Australian race row politician banned by hometown.</headline>

<p>Controversial Australian politician Pauline Hanson has been banned from using her local town hall or any other local government building in her hometown for political rallies.</p>
<p>The Ipswich City Council, just outside Brisbane, on Tuesday banned Hanson's One Nation Party from its buildings because of the high costs of providing security for her political rallies, which have attracted violent and rowdy protests.</p>
<p>Ipswich councillor Paul Tully, an anti-Hanson activist, said Hanson's political rallies were a &quot;travelling circus&quot; which created huge security problems.</p>
<p>&quot;The ratepayers of Ipswich will no longer have to pick up the cost of employing security guards to protect Pauline Hanson,&quot; Tully told reporters.</p>
<p>Tully also called on Australia's 600 local governments to ban Hanson's political rallies from their buildings.</p>
<p>A One Nation rally earlier this month in the Victoria state town of Dandenong saw protesters pelt supporters with eggs and urine-filled balloons. An elderly man sustained a fractured skull in the ensuing scuffles.</p>
<p>Hanson's anti-immigration comments have sparked a bitter race debate in Australia and her newly-registered party has won widespread support in rural Australia.</p>
