<headline>SOCCER-SPANISH LEAGUE FIXTURES THIS WEEKEND.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-05-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Matches scheduled for this weekend in the Spanish first division (kick-off times GMT, league positions in parentheses):</p>
<p>Saturday:</p>
<p>Valladolid (6) v Extremadura (17) kick off 1600</p>
<p>Valladolid manager Vicente Cantatore is looking to clock up a record of home victories in a season against an Extremadura side that will be without injured Argentine striker Carlos Dure and striker Ivan Perez, who signed on Thursday for Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Barcelona (2) v Real Madrid (1) 1830</p>
<p>Real will be looking to seal the Spanish championship with their first league win at the Camp Nou since the 1983-84 season. For Barcelona the clash is vital in their aspirations to take Spain's second place in the European Cup.</p>
<p>Playing Sunday:</p>
<p>Logrones (22) v Real Betis (3) 1600</p>
<p>Bottom club Logrones are 11 points away from safety, and desperately need a result against high-flying Betis, who will rest winger Emmanuel Amunike ahead of next week's derby game with Sevilla but welcome back suspended striker Alfonso Perez.</p>
<p>Real Sociedad (9) v Racing Santander (11) 1600</p>
<p>Real Sociedad hope to bring back midfielder Javi De Pedro from injury for a meeting between two teams that are drifting in mid-table but still have outside hopes of a UEFA Cup place.</p>
<p>Sporting Gijon (19) v Celta Vigo (12) 1700</p>
<p>Sporting may bring in reserve team striker Ruben Blaya in their bid to escape relegation. They will be looking to end their poor run against a Celta side who are particularly weak away from home.</p>
<p>Sevilla (21) v Hercules (20) 1700</p>
<p>Flavio Maestri reappears after suspension for Hercules, who will be accompanied by several thousand fans to the game with Sevilla, who are immersed in a boardroom crisis which produced a demonstration of 15,000 supporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>Compostela (14) v Rayo Vallecano (18) 1700</p>
<p>Compostela have gone nine games undefeated at home, and have never lost in Santiago to Rayo, whose own strength is in away games.</p>
<p>Tenerife (8) v Oviedo (15) 1700</p>
<p>Abel Xabier and Paulo Bento are out injured for Oviedo against a Tenerife outfit still in with a chance of winning one of Spain's four UEFA Cup places.</p>
<p>Zaragoza (16) v Espanyol (13) 1700</p>
<p>Zaragoza will bring in former Real Madrid defender Miquel Soler for an uphill battle against an Espanyol side who have taken 19 of the last 21 points from home games.</p>
<p>Atletico Madrid (5) v Athletic Bilbao (7) 1730</p>
<p>Atletico have won their last three home games with Athletic and hope to continue their recent recovery with a victory that would virtually guarantee a UEFA Cup place for next season. The visitors have international striker Julen Guerrero suspended.</p>
<p>Playing Monday:</p>
<p>Valencia (10) v Deportivo Coruna (4) 1930</p>
<p>Deportivo have won twice in their last three visits to Valencia and will look for another result on a day in which Barcelona face a stiff test in the battle for Spain's second European Cup place.</p>
