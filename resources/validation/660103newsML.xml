<p>The House Ways and Means Committee early on Friday approved a plan that would replace a proposed tax on Indian tribal businesses including gaming with an increase in an airline fee on international flights.</p>
<p>The committee, in a vote that crossed party lines, voted 22-16 to approve an amendment that would raise international departure and arrival fees to $15.50 per passenger from the $10 fee proposed in the committee chairman's bill. The fee is currently $6.</p>
<p>The vote came as the committee continued working on a broad tax bill to cut federal taxes by a net $85 billion over five years.</p>
<p>Some committee members, who opposed taxing Indian tribal commerce, said they were equally opposed to raising air travel fees and struggled with the decision.</p>
<p>The full tax bill, if approved by the committee, would then go to the House floor for a vote.</p>
<p>Committee chairman Bill Archer, a Texas Republican, who had proposed the Indian gaming tax in his bill, said casinos on Indian reservations brought in revenues of $4.5 billion in 1995. &quot;They have a clear tax advantage, which is a major advantage to them,&quot; Archer said.</p>
<p>Archer's bill called for the international fee to be indexed using the Consumer Price Index beginning Jan. 1, 1999.</p>
<p>On Monday, Archer said U.S. international flight fees were among the lowest in the world and his plan would move to correct that.</p>
