<title>UK: North sea crude weaker, Brent trades 5 cents lower.</title>
<headline>North sea crude weaker, Brent trades 5 cents lower.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>North Sea crudes weakened on Thursday as a late slump in Brent paper quotes undermined an already struggling wet market.</p>
<p>A Brent cargo loading Nov 8-10 traded at December Brent -40 cents, five cents down on Wednesday's deal for a 12-14 loader.</p>
<p>Dec paper was notionally at screen levels of $23.00/$23.05 a barrel by 1630 GMT, over 50 cents down on the day.</p>
<p>The rapid slide in Dec Brent from the day's high of over $23.90 a barrel put pressure on intermonth spreads with Dec/Jan talked some five cents lower at either side of +40 cents and Jan/Feb at around +50/+52 cents.  </p>
<p>Other grades also softened with Forties shedding six cents from its last trade to change hands at a weak Dated Brent +2 cents for a cargo loading Nov 16-20.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very low number, there are just no requirements for mid-Nov,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Another Forties cargo, loading Nov 15-20 was still to be cleared out.</p>
<p>Norwegian Oseberg, with the most muscle of all North Sea grades, traded at Dated Brent +30 cents, two cents down from a deal on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Despite weak prices in Europe, traders said that the arb to the U.S. remained closed.</p>
<p>&quot;There just isn't the buying interest there, noone is working it.&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Mediterranean sour crude demand remained weak despite the closure of Novorossiisk on Thursday morning. Several Urals were still on offer, but prices stabilised after a sharp fall earlier this week.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still heavy on prompt Urals, but after mid-month I think it might bounce&quot; a trader said. Large cargoes were pegged at Dated -$1.15/$1.20 and small cargoes ten cents higher.</p>
