<p>A group of Sri Lankan political activists demonstrated outside the offices of the two main political parties on Thursday to protest against growing violence in the runup to this month's local government poll.</p>
<p>&quot;Ninety percent of the violence is arising out of the conflict between the (ruling) People's Alliance (PA) and the (opposition) United National Party (UNP),&quot; said Charles Abeysekera of the Coalition Against Political Violence.</p>
<p>&quot;We're concerned about the effects of violence on the immediate political situation and the campaign for the election,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>About 300 people took part in the silent demonstration, holding placards decrying the growing incidence of violence in the campaign for the March 21 polls, the PA's first popularity test since winning power in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;Ballot not bullet&quot; said one placard, while a ballot box held by a demonstrator was painted with the slogan &quot;No terror votes or bogus votes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Over the next few days we plan to appeal to voters to reject candidates involved in political violence,&quot; he added. &quot;Political parties have declared they are against violence but it still continues,&quot; he said. &quot;So the ultimate sanction must come from the voters themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>An independent monitoring group said about 1,000 incidents of polls-related violence, mostly threats against candidates, have been reported since last month.</p>
<p>The highest number of allegations were made against the PA, the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence said.</p>
<p>The poll campaign has been marred by the killing of a ruling coalition lawmaker last month. An opposition UNP member of parliament and a former UNP mayor are among the suspects detained by police in connection with the killing.</p>
<p>The government has since launched a crackdown on illegal weapons used by politicians, granting an amnesty till March 15 for their surrender.</p>
