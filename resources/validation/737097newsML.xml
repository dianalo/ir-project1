<p>A Turkish military prosecutor has launched an investigation into allegations that former prime minister Tansu Ciller accepted money from abroad to work against the national interest, Turkish papers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Hurriyet daily said the prosecutor would look into the possibility that Ciller, who left office last month, had broken both military and civilian laws on safeguarding national security. Other newspapers carried similar stories.</p>
<p>Hurriyet said the investigation was based on accusations by far-left politician Dogu Perincek that Ciller, who became Turkey's first woman prime minister in 1993, had worked for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).</p>
<p>Ciller denied the charges and other corruption-related accusations against her and her businessman husband.</p>
<p>&quot;I have nothing to say about the indictment prepared by Dogu Perincek. But shame on anyone who takes this claim in hand and does not reject it,&quot; Ciller was quoted as saying by Anatolian news agency.</p>
<p>An Ankara U.S. embassy spokeswoman rejected the charges.</p>
<p>&quot;Any suggestion of a clandestine relation between the United States government and Mrs. Ciller is completely false,&quot; said the spokesman, Margarete Schmidt.</p>
<p>In Turkey, the influential army has the power to put civilians on trial on charges relating to military matters.</p>
<p>&quot;The next stage is for the prosecutor to ask Ciller to testify. If she refuses, a report aimed at lifting her parliamentary immunity will be prepared,&quot; Hurriyet said.</p>
<p>Ciller angered the secularist establishment, led by the army, by taking her pro-Western party into coalition last year with the Islamists of former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan.</p>
<p>Ciller served as foreign minister in that government until it collapsed under pressure from the secularist army last month.</p>
