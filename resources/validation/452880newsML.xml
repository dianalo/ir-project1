<p>London-based HSBC Holdings PLC agreed in principle on Tuesday to buy a stake in Grupo Financiero Serfin, Mexico's third-largest banking group that lost more than $800 million in 1996.</p>
<p>The banks said the purchase of 19.9 percent of Serfin would cost around $300 million, though it was subject to certain conditions that Serfin was confident would be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The purchase by one of the world's largest banks was considered a crucial step for dragging Serfin out of a prolonged crisis in which it has been plagued by bad loans and steep losses since Mexico's economy crashed in December 1994.</p>
<p>It also reinforces the foothold in Latin America of HSBC -- known commonly as Hong Kong Shanghai-Midland Bank -- which already has stakes in banks in Chile, Argentina and Brazil.</p>
<p>&quot;The motive in itself was to expand the presence of the group in Latin America,&quot; HSBC's Mexican representative Luis Miguel Vilatela told Reuters. &quot;Serfin is one of the biggest banks in Mexico and despite its disappointing results its name continues to be very good.&quot;</p>
<p>The sale was announced the day Serfin reported a spectacular 1996 loss of some $880 million, mainly the result of creating more than $1 billion in reserves to cover unpaid loans that have almost drained the bank dry in the last two years.</p>
<p>Serfin Director General Adolfo Lagos refused to put a figure on how much the bank has cost its owners in recent years as it struggled to avoid collapse, describing the effort as &quot;too masochistic.&quot; But analysts say shareholders have been forced to invest more than double what they paid for the bank in recapitalizing it.</p>
<p>He admitted at a news conference that one of its attractions for HSBC was that &quot;it is lifting itself out of the basement, and its share price is on the floor.&quot; It would be hard for Serfin to lose more money, he intimated.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday Serfin announced that the government would become a part shareholder in the bank, taking a stake for some $250 million that was just short of HSBC's.</p>
<p>In exchange, Serfin sold some $1.3 billion problem mortgage loans to the government, that Lagos described as one of its final efforts to clear up the bank's default-plagued loan portfolio.</p>
<p>Analysts raised concerns that both sales would significantly dilute the amount of Serfin shares on the market, cutting into shareholder profits. Lagos predicted the dilution would be less than 40 percent.</p>
<p>Before the sale to HSBC is finalised, he said, it must be approved by both banks' shareholders and boardmembers. Serfin must also raise more capital, which it plans to do by selling its insurance unit.</p>
<p>To complete the sale, HSBC will buy some $290 million covertible subordinated debentures that Serfin issued to J.P. Morgan in July 1996.</p>
<p>Serfin has some 600 branches and assets of $20 billion in Mexico. HSBC has over 3,800 offices in 78 countries, with assets at the end of last year of $402 billion.</p>
