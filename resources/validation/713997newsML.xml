<text>
<p>Britain's General Electric Co. Plc Tuesday unveiled its strategic blueprint for the next century, putting its focus clearly on defence and signalling a possible spinoff of its rail and power joint venture.</p>
<p>The policy review came against a backdrop of mounting pressure for the European defence industry to consolidate after American mega-mergers between Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp. and between Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.</p>
<p>George Simpson, successor to the company's long-time managing director, Lord Weinstock, announced a key shift away from the old GEC culture of joint ventures and toward managed businesses. He said GEC-Marconi, the defence electronics division, will become the new &quot;heart of the group.&quot;</p>
<p>Investors, however, reacted with disappointment to what was described as &quot;lack of tangible news&quot; by one trader, with GEC's stock reversing some of the strong gains of recent sessions.</p>
<p>Simpson said GEC's new mission statement was &quot;designed to build Marconi into a global player, spanning all three principal defence electronics markets -- America, Europe and Asia -- and to focus the group's industrial electronics and communications activities on existing or potential global leadership positions.&quot;</p>
<p>The future of GEC's two main joint ventures was placed under review.</p>
<p>Simpson said in an interview that GEC and French partner Alcatel Alsthom were considering taking their 50-50 rail and power venture GEC-ALSTHOM public on the London and Paris stock exchanges.</p>
<p>&quot;We have looked at whether to demerge or float the business and that is the subject of discussion,&quot; Simpson told Reuters.</p>
<p>GEC expects a decision within the next three months. If agreed, the public offering could take between six and nine months to implement.</p>
<p>Explaining the rationale, Simpson said, &quot;That business has become very large. It is beginning to outgrow its parent.&quot;</p>
<p>GEC is also considering &quot;repositioning&quot; its telecommunications joint venture, GPT, which is 60 percent-owned by GEC and 40 percent-owned by Siemens AG.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly one option was to sell our stake to Siemens. But I am driven by shareholder value. We will monitor the business and rewrite the charter for that business, as telecoms is a high growth area which GEC should remain in,&quot; Simpson said.</p>
<p>GEC said it was committed to spending its huge cash pile -- valued by Simpson at over two billion pounds ($3.4 billion) -- on investment and acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p>Under Weinstock, GEC traditionally maintained a highly cautious capital structure, with high levels of net cash.</p>
<p>The first call on the cash is now investment. But Simpson made clear that he would not shy from returning cash to shareholders if he could not find suitable buying opportunities.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can consummate deals, I may not be able to return any cash to shareholders. But if there is no way forward on deals, I will return cash,&quot; he said.</p>
