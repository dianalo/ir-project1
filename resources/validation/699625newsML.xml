<headline>GREEK STOCKS FIRM ON UPBEAT BANKS, THIN TRADE.</headline>
<dateline>ATHENS 1997-07-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Greek stocks gained ground in lethargic trade on Tuesday, helped by upbeat banking stocks which recovered from recent lows.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market was moving sideways in slack volume with investors being sidelined but prospects were positive and sentiment remained optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is directionless in thin trading as investors are either sidelined or engage in quiet stock picking in non-bank large and mid-cap stocks,&quot; said Maria Lentziou, an analyst at Olympic Securities.</p>
<p>Tuesday's turnover was subdued, amounting to 11.9 billion drachmas on volume of 5.1 million shares, which included block trades.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are in a wait-and-see mood, but sentiment is good and prospects remain positive,&quot; said Takis Niarchos, an analyst at Hellenic-American Securities. &quot;I expect buying interest to pick up soon, with foreign buying playing a more active role.&quot;</p>
<p>Easing short-term interbank rates were expected to favourably affect equities despite a halt in the drop of CPI inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has already digested indications of a difficulty in bringing consumer price inflation below current levels in coming months,&quot; said Olympic's Lentziou.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll among 15 bankers and economists produced a mean and median 5.4 percent forecast for Greek consumer inflation in June, unchanged from May.</p>
<p>&quot;Easing interbank rates will greatly help sentiment, starting from banks which already started to recover from recent price fluctuations,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, one-month Athibor, Greece's reference interbank rate, eased 49 basis points to 10.98 percent on improved liquidity conditions.</p>
<p>The Athens general index added 0.43 percent or 6.56 points to 1,525.07 from Monday's 1,518.51 close, trading tightly between 1,515 and 1,527 points.</p>
<p>Banks led the market with a 0.87 percent climb, which outweighed a 1.07 percent drop in construction.</p>
<p>Industrials were virtually flat, slipping 0.01 percent.</p>
<p>Blocks were traded in Piraeus leasing , total 75,000 shares at 4,215 drachmas, and Eltrak , 1,196,000 shares at 895.</p>
<p>Decliners led advancers 106 to 98 with 25 shares unchanged on 229 traded.</p>
<p>OTE telecom Global Depository Shares (GDS) were quoted at London's SEAQ International market at $11.50-$11.90. Two GDSs make up one share of OTE.</p>
<p>The Merrill Lynch call spread warrant on OTE with a strike price of 3,800 drachmas, capped at 5,000 drachmas, was quoted at 1,116-1,146 drachmas.</p>
<p>The recently launched second Merrill Lynch call spread warrant on OTE with a strike price of 6,800 drachmas, capped at 10,000 drachmas, was quoted at 1,160-1,220 drachmas. The warrants expire December 16, 1998. Shares of the underlying instrument firmed 50 drachmas to 6,500.</p>
