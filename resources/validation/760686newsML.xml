<p>----------------- VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - JULY 28 --------------</p>
<p>* NYMEX crude may test the $20.23 high of July 17 and then the $20.45 top of July 7, the high of the market's recent range.</p>
<p>* Trendline support from the June 20 low of $18.35 continues to put a solid base to the market and comes in at around $19/40-50 on the spot month chart today.</p>
<p>NYMEX crude and products futures were seen continuing to head choppily higher on Monday with the market looking technically well supported once initial bouts of profit taking are quenched, analysts said.</p>
<p>Peter Sceats at CharTech MMS said, &quot;The mini imperfect double bottom on the NYMEX crude spot chart at $18.98/99 (from last Monday and Tuesday) and the $19.39/40 gap-up (from Tuesday to Wednesday) set up a relatively strong close on both sides of the Atlantic on Friday&quot;.</p>
<p>Trendline support from the June 20 low of $18.35 up through last weeks double bottom continues to form a solid base.</p>
<p>That comes in at $19/40-50 on the spot month chart today.</p>
<p>Omar Gadsby, analyst at MMS International in London, said he remained mildy bullish and expected the market to test the $20.23 a barrel high of July 17 and then the $20.45 top of July 7, the high of the market's recent range.</p>
<p>&quot;I am relatively encouraged by the price action over the past last two trading days and feel these levels could be tested today,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said in the medium to long term there are many key levels that need to be breached to suggest a meaningful recovery, but expected prices to move choppily higher in the short term.</p>
<p>He suggested support would come in around the $19.25 low of June 21 on the September chart which represents a 62 percent Fibonacci retracement of the $18.50/$20.23 trading range.</p>
<p>Other analysts were not so convinced the market has the momentum enough to move higher.</p>
<p>GNI research said in their daily report, &quot;(NYMEX crude's) close below $20 on Friday does increase the uncertainty a little&quot;.</p>
<p>They expected unleaded gasoline futures to continue to lead the market but said it would first have to get over a few profit taking hurdles if it is to go any higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Mogas now has the psychological 65 cents in it's sights although it would be no surprise to see some profit-taking after Friday's run-up&quot;.</p>
<p>Al Graham at Elliott Wave International continued to take a mildly bearish stance, &quot;Confidence is less now, but the door to $18.50 remains open as long as resistance at $19.23 holds,&quot; Graham said.</p>
