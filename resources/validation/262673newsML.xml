<p>Laughing is good for you, and drinkers laugh more, so drinking must also be good for you, British psychologists said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Lowe, a psychologist at the University of Hull, said three separate studies showed clearly what any reluctantly sober party-goer has known for years -- that social drinkers laugh more than people who drink very little or not at all.</p>
<p>Reporting to the British Psychological Society's annual meeting, and just in time for Christmas party-goers, Lowe cited reports showing laughing can stimulate the body's immune system.</p>
<p>Added to scientific evidence about the health-giving properties of alcohol, he said the implications were clear.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike the earlier biological and medical studies which suggested that alcohol has a cardiological protective effect, our message is that maybe it is something to do with the person's lifestyle and attitude to life and the fact that they engage in fun and laughter more,&quot; Lowe said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are saying perhaps people shouldn't use alcohol as a medicine but only as a facilitator for fun and l believe that might be the important thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Lowe's team did three studies on drinking and laughter. A survey of 332 people who defined themselves as &quot;social drinkers&quot; showed they used humour and laughter more in everyday life than lighter drinkers or teetotallers.</p>
<p>&quot;These are people who regarded themselves as social drinkers and perhaps who do not drink more than 50 units a week,&quot; Lowe said in a telephone interview ahead of his presentation. One unit is defined as a glass of wine, a small beer or a small serving of spirits.</p>
<p>But, just in case they were exaggerating or had their judgment clouded somehow, Lowe and colleagues visited pubs in the line of duty to watch drinkers in action.</p>
<p>Sure enough, those who drank moderately laughed more. But this did not translate directly into more drinks equalling more laughs.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the one who had the heaviest drinking score they did not have the heaviest laughter score,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;And overall you find for instance that females drink less than the males, but they don't necessarily laugh less.&quot;</p>
<p>Lowe's group then tried a controlled laboratory experiment. Volunteers sat down to watch a funny film and were given either alcohol or soft drinks.</p>
<p>Trained observers counted the laughs and again, those given the alcohol laughed more.</p>
<p>&quot;We still don't know why, because you'd have to do more controls to find out if alcohol is directly causing laughter or if people who laugh a lot just become thirsty and drink more,&quot; Lowe said. &quot;All we can say at the moment is that there is a link.&quot;</p>
<p>Lowe said he would not advise heading for the drinks cabinet. &quot;I wouldn't necessarily drink more as a basis of this research, he said. &quot;I would laugh more.&quot;</p>
