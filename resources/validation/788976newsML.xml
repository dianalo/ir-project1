<p>General Motors Corp's top purchasing executive urged suppliers at an automotive conference Friday to cut in half the time it takes to develop new technologies.</p>
<p>&quot;Where process time can be reduced, reduce it,&quot; Harold Kutner vice president of worldwide purchasing said in remarks prepared for delivery.</p>
<p>&quot;And I don't mean shave a second here or there. Look for quantum reductions of 10, 20, even 50 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kutner spoke on the final day of the University of Michigan's week-long Management Briefing Seminar.</p>
<p>Kutner said GM spends about $70 billion a year to buy components and systems for the 8.3 million vehicles it makes in 25 countries.</p>
<p>GM has angered suppliers in the past by demanding price cuts. But Kutner said the automaker is improving its relations. He pointed to an annual survey from Ward's Auto World, a trade publication, which showed 32 percent of the survey's respondents chose GM as one of the best automakers to work with.</p>
<p>The results show GM's global supplier process is working, Kutner said, as evidenced by the growing number of contracts GM is awarding in Latin America and Asia/Pacific.</p>
<p>GM's worldwide purchasing operations are structured into four groups around the world, Europe, Latin America, Asia/Pacific and North America. The regions are designed to simplify purchasing decisions and help suppliers become part of GM's international sourcing network</p>
<p>In Latin America, where GM has 21 percent market share, the company is buidling new facilities, including a new stamping plant in Brazil, a manufacturing facility in Argentina and new paint shops in Argentina and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Those investments have resulted in 40 new international suppliers starting operations, representing more than $380 million in purchases from GM.</p>
<p>GM's Asia/Pacific group have helped 30 global suppliers set up facilities in Thailand to provide parts for a new vehicle program that will reach more than $600 million a year, Kutner said. GM has a goal in Thailand of sourcing 60 percent of its parts locally.</p>
