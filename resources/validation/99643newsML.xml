<p>Three years after privatization, Brazil's steel company Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) is forging ahead to become Latin America's leading producer of coated steel and one of the most competitive steel companies in the world by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Armed with a $1.3 billion investment budget for its steel mill and plans to participate in a number of strategic privatizations in the infrastructure sector, CSN aims to improve quality and add value to its products while reducing costs.  </p>
<p>&quot;CSN wants to be one of the most competitive in the world and the leading company in Latin America for zinc coated sheets and tin plates,&quot; said Carlos Augusto Septimio de Carvalho, who is responsible for CSN investor relations.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not expecting international steel prices to reach the high levels they had in the past, so it is important that we become more competitive.&quot;  </p>
<p>The $1.3 billion investment in its integrated steel mill in Volta Redonda, Rio de Janeiro state, includes the construction of a $250 million 230-megawatt thermoelectric plant inside the mill which will cover 50 percent of the mill's energy demand.</p>
<p>The company is investing $80 million in the Ita hydroelectric plant on the Rio Uruguai river on the border of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul states and $16.2 million in the Igarapava hydroelectric project on the Rio Grande river in Minas Gerais.</p>
<p>CSN is also investing $80 million in the Ita hydroelectric plant on the Rio Uruguai river on the border of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul states and $16.2 million in the Igarapava hydroelectric project on the Rio Grande river in Minas Gerais.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to be self-sufficient in energy supply by the year 2000 so we won't be dependent on Eletrobras (the state power firm), which might not produce enough to satisfy total demand,&quot; Carvalho said.</p>
<p>The plants will cut energy costs at the Volta Redonda mill by 40 percent and cover its entire energy demand.  </p>
<p>CSN, which is the third largest consumer of electricity in Brazil, has already bought a 7.25 percent stake in privatized power distributor Light, which sells 11 percent of its electricity to CSN.</p>
<p>Most recently, CSN led the MRS Logistica consortium, which acquired for $888.9 million a 30-year concession to operate the choice southeast section of the federal railway network. Before that CSN acquired a similar concession to operate the center-east railway section.  Both railways connect the company's mines in Minas Gerais with Volta Redonda and the ports of Angra dos Reis, Sepetiba and Rio de Janeiro.  </p>
<p>CSN plans to benefit further from Brazil's privatization program by buying concessions to operate the three ports of Rio, Sepetiba and Angra dos Reis.</p>
<p>&quot;We estimate savings of 50 percent in export costs and 35 percent in import costs by gaining concessions to operate the three ports,&quot; Carvalho said. &quot;CSN alone is responsible for 95 percent of traffic in the port of Sepetiba.&quot;</p>
<p>Overall, CSN hopes to reduce costs 13 percent by 2000, increase steel output from 4.5 million tonnes this year to six million tonnes in 2002 and boost coated steel production 10 percent to 53 percent of total production by 2000, he said.  </p>
<p>Although coated steel currently accounts for less than half of CSN's output, sales of coated steel made up 54 percent of CSN's turnover in 1995.</p>
<p>By increasing coated steel production CSN also hopes to increase its market share as a supplier to the car industry to 40 percent.</p>
<p>The company's plans to build a $600 million mini steel mill in Brazil's northeastern state of Ceara in conjunction with state mining giant Companhia do Vale do Rio Doce and textile group Vicunha largely depend on whether a car factory will be located there.</p>
<p>Carvalho said the company was also looking to reduce the share of exports to 20 percent of total sales from 35 percent at present because steel prices in Brazil were higher than abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea is to focus more on the growing Brazilian market,&quot; he said.  &quot;We will probably continue to export the same amount of steel, but it will be a smaller percentage of total volume.&quot;</p>
