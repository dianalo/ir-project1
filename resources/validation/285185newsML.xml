<p>Bosnia's inter-ethnic parliament appointed a peacetime cabinet on Friday at its first full session, approving nominations for the ministries which make up the country's weak central government.</p>
<p>The Council of Ministers proposed by Bosnia's collective presidency was unopposed by the 42-member House of Representatives, elected in national polls in September, with only one deputy abstaining.</p>
<p>The Council of Ministers, or cabinet, is led by two co-chairmen, Haris Silajdzic, a Moslem and former Bosnian prime minister, and Boro Bosic, a Serb.</p>
<p>Jadranko Prlic, a Croat who served for a time as Bosnia's foreign minister, kept his post in the new cabinet.</p>
<p>Another Moslem, former premier Hasan Muratovic, was named as minister of foreign trade and a Serb, Spasoje Albijanic, will serve as minister of communications.</p>
<p>Each minister has two deputies and the posts are distributed equally among the three national communities.</p>
<p>The council, which will primarily handle issues touching on foreign relations, serves as a weak central authority ruling over Bosnia's autonomous Serb and Moslem-Croat territories.</p>
<p>Earlier, former enemies sat uncomfortably across an aisle and listened to speeches from all three members of the collective presidency in a museum room formerly reserved for aquariums and snakes in natural history exhibits.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the real work must start,&quot; Michael Steiner, deputy to the international High Representative to Bosnia, told the deputies in a speech.</p>
<p>Bosnian voters &quot;expect you to get the country back on track. They expect you to provide them with peaceful, decent living conditons,&quot; the German diplomat said.</p>
<p>The Moslem chairman of the presidency, Alija izetbegovic, wished the parliament success and called for the deputies to fully implement the Dayton peace accords which ended the 3-1/2 year war in November 1995.</p>
<p>The Serb member of the presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik, was greeted with an awkard silence from Moslem and Croat deputies when he rose to deliver his address.</p>
<p>His speech appeared to cast doubt on Bosnia's unity, as prescribed by Dayton.</p>
<p>Krajisnik, who bitterly opposed Bosnia's break from old Yugoslavia, said the former warring factions had agreed to recognise Bosnia's Moslem-Croat and Serb territories as &quot;two states&quot; but also said that Bosnia-Herzegovina &quot;exists too&quot;.</p>
<p>Saying it was time to heal the wounds of war, Krajisnik warned that the peace would hold only if all three national communities had equal rights.</p>
<p>&quot;Bosnia-Herzegovina can survive if we work hard to ensure all three nations and both entities feel equal and secure.&quot;</p>
<p>Serb deputies had boycotted an inaugural session of parliament in October, snubbing foreign dignitaries who had flown in for the ceremony.</p>
<p>The Serbs had cited objections to the venue in the city centre and to the text of an oath pledging loyalty to Bosnia as a single state.</p>
<p>Since then all the Serb deputies have signed the &quot;solemn declaration&quot; to the Bosnian constitution but avoided taking the oath in a public ceremony, diplomats said.</p>
<p>A 15-member upper chamber, the House of Peoples, is also due to convene for the first time in the Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica in Serb-controlled territory later on Friday.</p>
