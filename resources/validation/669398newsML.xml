<headline>FOCUS-Coffee rally peters out, copper edges higher.</headline>

<p>A new rally in world coffee prices stumbled on its way higher on Wednesday as speculative buyers changed tracks and began liquidating their positions.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the commodity markets, industrial metals notched up modest gains, with copper bumping into resistance at $2,600 a tonne and settling comfortably back to mid-range levels.</p>
<p>Despite a wave of follow-through buying in London after the previous day's surge, coffee turned abruptly negative after trade began in New York and continued moving away from a 20-year high set in late May.</p>
<p>The recent decline had been accelerated by a bearish world production report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which late on Tuesday said it stuck by its ambitious forecasts. It cited generally good growing conditions and an increased number of producing trees in Brazil.</p>
<p>The Association of Coffee Producing Countries had expressed concern over the USDA forecast, which it said differed vastly from recent production numbers released by some governments.</p>
<p>A warm, subtropical high pressure ridge is expected to build over Brazil's coffee belt over the weekend with no threat of cold winter weather that might damage the crop.</p>
<p>London robusta coffee futures ended the day down $45 on the September contract at $1,865 per tonne.</p>
<p>Precious metals put in a quiet day, with gold easing in late London on news that Belgium planned to sell 26 tonnes a year for a total of 133 tonnes to reduce its debt.</p>
<p>Gold slipped to just above $340 per ounce from around $342.</p>
<p>Gold's weak downtrend since early May was still seen intact, traders said, although it could receive a long term boost if a future European single currency emerges weakened after the revised European Union treaty signed on Monday.</p>
<p>Gold also lost some shine after the Swiss parliament approved a revised charter for the Swiss central bank, allowing it to start lending gold to improve its earnings.</p>
<p>In the grain markets, reports of better-than-expected yields in the hard red winter wheat harvest areas pushed wheat futures lower on the Chicago Board of Trade.</p>
<p>But concern about the effects of an El Nino weather pattern -- a warm ocean temperature phenomenon that occurs every two to seven years with profound consequences for global weather -- helped underpin the market.</p>
<p>A strong El Nino now developing in the tropical Pacific is expected to trigger cooler and wetter-than-normal weather in the southern United States this winter and drought conditions in South Africa, Northeastern Brazil and Australia.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said late on Tuesday it had already triggered a drought in India this summer, as evidenced by the weak start to that country's annual monsoon.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a big event,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Crude oil also came under pressure in a day of choppy trade with many investors wary of committing to the market before next week's OPEC meeting in Vienna. Worries persist over the second part of an Iraqi oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.</p>
<p>Benchmark London Brent for August delivery was off 29 cents at $17.78.</p>
