<p>Morocco has approved a draft law to set up elected powerful councils in the country's 16 regions, including the disputed Western Sahara, aimed at giving all people a voice in daily economic and financial management.</p>
<p>The official MAP news agency quoted the Interior Minister Driss Basri on Wednesday as saying the draft was examined and approved by a cabinet meeting presided by the Prime Minister Abdellatif Filali on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The draft aims to respond to Moroccan people demands...and efforts of King Hassan to modernise the country and meet the challenges of the 21th century,&quot; MAP quoted Basri as saying.</p>
<p>The 70-articles draft law is expected to be discussed by the 333-seat parliament soon, MAP said.</p>
<p>The change is part of the constitutional reforms adopted earlier this year including the establishment of a bi-cameral parliament to be elected in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Within the decentralisation, the region will be managed by a regional council elected for a period of six years,&quot; Basri said.</p>
<p>The council's decision will be carried out by the interior ministry representatives, including the governors, MAP said.</p>
<p>According to the new law, the state will transfer some of its financial powers such as tax collection and means to build schools and hospitals.</p>
<p>The government plans to create a special fund for the development of the poor regions, MAP said.</p>
<p>Earlier the authorities published the list of the new regional cut up as follows: Tangier-Tetouan, Hoceima-Taza, Fes- Boulemane, Meknes-Tafilalt, Tadla Atlas Central, Centre- Atlantique, Rabat-Khemisset, Casablanca, Oriental, Tensift, Chaouia-Ourdigha, Gharb, Souss-Massa-Draa, Guelmime-Smara, Laayoune-Boujdour and Oued Eddahab.</p>
