<p>At least 46 people have been killed in the worst flooding on Czech territory for a century and the country braced on Thursday for more misery as weathermen forecast renewed heavy rain at the weekend.</p>
<p>River workers emptied dams on rivers in anticipation of another onslaught from the skies. The Czech Weather Service (CHMU) said heavy rain was expected to sweep in from Austria and head for the flood-hit east Bohemia and Moravia regions.</p>
<p>&quot;If this forecast is true, that there will be relatively heavy rain, then we expect that water levels in the rivers will rise,&quot; said hydrologist Libor Elleder of the CHMU.</p>
<p>The service issued its highest level warning of more floods in the affected regions, though no immediate evacuation of people still living in the area was planned.</p>
<p>Up to 50 cm (19.5 inches) of rain have inundated eastern areas of the Czech Republic in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>Elleder said regions hit by the flood surge, triggered by days of torrential rain, were so saturated that any more precipitation would rapidly raise water levels.</p>
<p>Police put the confirmed death toll at 46. Three more were missing.</p>
<p>Floods receded further in the east and south as the massive pulse of water headed south towards the Danube.</p>
<p>But on the Morava river, which runs through the worst-afflicted areas in the east, and on the Vltava, north of the capital Prague, authorities released water from dams to cope with the expected downpour.</p>
<p>The south of neighbouring Poland has also been badly hit by floods, which have killed 46 people there as well. Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz warned parliament on Thursday that more rain could bring new floods.</p>
<p>The flooding has become an economic catastrophe for the Czech Republic, a country of 10.5 million people.</p>
<p>Economists are still tallying the cost of the damage but some say it could total up to 100 billion crowns ($2.9 billion).</p>
<p>Hundreds of homes have been destroyed or badly damaged and road, rail and telecommunications links have been cut. Many companies have been forced to reduce or stop production and thousands of hectares of crops have been swamped.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Ivan Pilip said the government was considering taking a loan of more than 10 billion crowns, offered by the European Investment Bank, the long-term credit arm of the European Union, to rebuild damaged roads and public utilities.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a loan would be under conditions incomparable with those under which the state is raising money in standard operations,&quot; Pilip he told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not able to estimate the sum...but it is clear that when talking about reconstruction of infrastructure, it would nto be a sum in the range of 10 billion (crowns) but something certainly higher,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Komercni Banka, the biggest Czech bank, said the floods would limit economic growth to the lower end of their foreceast range of 1.5-2.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The fallout of production in the afflicted land should result in very weak indicators of gross domestic product for the third quarter of this year,&quot; Chief Economist Kamil Janacek told a news conference.</p>
<p>However, the major rebuilding work would increase investment, he said. Shares in construction companies rose earlier in the week but ran out of steam on Thursday on the overall negative sentiment about the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest problems seems that the infrastructure is disrupted and it will take some time to organise. This will cause problems for the big companies,&quot; said analyst Jindrich Weiss of Zivnostenska Banka. ($ = 34.30 Czech Crowns)</p>
