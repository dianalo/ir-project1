<p>President Boris Yeltsin, keeping up a hectic workload during his summer vacation, boasted of his robust health on Wednesday as he approved a fresh flurry of reforms aimed at reviving Russia's sluggish economy.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who has staged a remarkable recovery this year from heart surgery and pneumonia, held talks with First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov and other senior officials at the Volzhsky Utyos resort by the river Volga in central Russia.</p>
<p>The 66-year-old Kremlin leader signed decrees aimed at relieving chronic delays in payment of state salaries, clamping down on tax debtors and boosting gold exports, Russian news agencies said.</p>
<p>The liberal Nemtsov, who is also energy minister, has been making regular visits to Yeltsin during the president's vacation to win his backing for documents needed to continue reforms.</p>
<p>On Wednesday he was accompanied by Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin, who discussed Russia's gold export policy with Yeltsin. Dubinin told Interfax news agency that Russia would sell only gold which it mines and not gold from its reserves.</p>
<p>Though on holiday since early July Yeltsin has made quite clear that he remains in charge, firing off a steady salvo of commands on a wide range of issues from army reform to tax dodgers while enjoying his hobbies of fishing and tennis.</p>
<p>Another of the visitors to Volzhsky Utyos in recent days has been Renat Akchurin who performed the quintuple bypass on Yeltsin's heart last November, Interfax said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin discovered he could stand the heat of a Russian banya (sauna) better than the cardiac surgeon.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to prove to him that my heart works like a clock, I took him to the banya,&quot; Interfax quoted Yeltsin as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;First he worked on me with the birch twigs and then I worked on him. We found out that his pulse was quicker than mine after that.&quot;</p>
<p>A bundle of birch twigs is traditionally used in the Russian banya to invigorate the blood circulation.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel well and I am having a good rest,&quot; Yeltsin said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, in a further sign of his reinvigorated spirit, Yeltsin delighted human rights groups and outraged his Communist and nationalist opponents by vetoing a controversial bill that would have imposed tough curbs on evangelical Christians, Roman Catholics and other &quot;non-traditional&quot; religious groups.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said the draft law &quot;On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Association&quot; contradicted Russia's constitution guaranteeing equality for all confessions.</p>
<p>His veto of a bill overwhelmingly approved by both houses of parliament and strongly endorsed by the powerful Russian Orthodox Church showed he had not lost his taste for taking risks and cocking a snook at his political opponents.</p>
<p>Prominent communist Viktor Iluykhin said Yeltsin's veto showed yet again that Russia had become a protectorate of the West, referring to a threat by U.S. senators to withhold around $200 million worth of aid if the bill had been signed.</p>
<p>In a sign of the government's new determination to clear a huge backlog of wage arrears affecting millions of Russians, Yeltsin approved Nemtsov's plans to allow national power utility UES to issue convertible bonds.</p>
<p>Convertible bonds are bonds which can be converted into another financial instrument, sometimes another type of bond but more often into company shares.</p>
<p>Russian news agencies said the decree on the bonds, which are expected to hit international markets this autumn, would raise $870 million, helping to ease pressure on the budget.</p>
<p>Yeltsin also signed a decree prohibiting the government from providing guarantees on foreign credits to firms which fail to pay their taxes. The government is clamping down on tax dodgers, whose non-payments have exacerbated the problem of wage arrears.</p>
