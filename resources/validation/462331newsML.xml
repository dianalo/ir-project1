<p>The Sri Lankan government's sweeping win in Friday's local elections will help it push ahead with a plan to end the separatist war by Tamil Tiger rebels, politicians and analysts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the past two and a half years, the government has gone to the grassroots with its peace message, and it seems that the grassroots have accepted that message,&quot; said a Tamil political analyst who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>President Chandrika Kumaratunga's ruling People's Alliance (PA) coalition swept to a landslide victory in the local-level elections, widely seen as a mid-term appraisal of its performance since winning power in 1994.</p>
<p>Analysts said the poll results showed huge support for the PA in rural areas, indicating that a large percentage of the Indian Ocean island's population favoured the government and its peace plan to end the ethnic war, now in its 14th year.</p>
<p>&quot;Rural voters seem to have grown up. They no longer vote with their stomachs. They are looking at the vote as a means of achieving long-term goals,&quot; the Tamil political analyst said.</p>
<p>Elections Commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake said the PA won 194 councils and the opposition United National Party (UNP) 43 of the 238 local bodies at stake. One council was won by an independent group.</p>
<p>The predominantly Sinhalese country is in the midst of introducing constitutional reforms to grant autonomy to minorities and end the war by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels for an independent Tamil homeland in the north and east.</p>
<p>The government's devolution package is currently with a select committee and is expected to be presented to parliament by November. If approved by a two-thirds majority, it will be put to the people in a national referendum.</p>
<p>&quot;One can safely draw the conclusion that, by and large, the (majority) Sinhalese people are in favour of a political settlement,&quot; said Murugesu Sivasithamparam, president of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF).</p>
<p>&quot;During the poll, while the PA actively campaigned for the peace package, no one in the UNP spoke against it,&quot; he said. &quot;So the PA's victory and the UNP's stand (on the peace plan) shows that by and large, the Sinhalese people support a political settlement of the ethnic problem.&quot;</p>
<p>A Western diplomat said the PA, which has only a one-vote majority in parliament, was likely to use the win to pressure the UNP into helping push the peace plan through parliament.</p>
<p>Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister G.L. Peiris, seen as one of the architects of the peace plan, was quoted by the independent Sunday Island newspaper as saying the victory showed that voters support government policies.</p>
<p>Polls were not held in northern and eastern provinces, where government troops are fighting Tamil Tiger rebels.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the war but the rebels say the toll is higher.</p>
