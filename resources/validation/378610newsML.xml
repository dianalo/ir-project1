<title>USA: Dow falls on profit-taking; bonds, dollar stronger.</title>
<headline>Dow falls on profit-taking; bonds, dollar stronger.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell Friday as Wall Street took a breather a day after the blue-chip index closed above 7,000 points for the first time.</p>
<p>The dollar hit a three-year high against the Swiss franc and a fresh four-year peak vs. the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Bonds rose on news that wholesale prices fell for the first time in over two years in January.</p>
<p>U.S. bond and currency markets ended early in observance of the Presidents Day holiday on Monday.</p>
<p>The 30-share Dow fell 33.48 points to 6,988.96 while the broader market ended mixed. The index jumped 61 points to a record 7,022.44 on Thursday, capping a three-session rally of 216 points. For the week, it rose 133.16 points.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,346 to 1,148 on active volume of 484.4 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw a little bit of profit-taking. I don't think there's anything more to read into it,&quot; said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management.</p>
<p>As if recent reports hadn't painted a rosy enough picture of the economy, the Labour Department said wholesale prices fell 0.3 percent last month, the first drop since October 1994.</p>
<p>The news stunned economists and triggered a bond market rally that lifted the 30-year Treasury more than half a point, which lowered its yield to 6.53 percent from 6.63 percent on Thursday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>But stocks did not follow bonds, with equity investors just a bit out of breath after the recent fally and with markets closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a tendency to take profits once the market reaches a plateau and people are thinking 'Let me get this done today so I can have some peace this weekend',&quot; said Peggy Farley, chief executive at Amas Securities.</p>
<p>With the Dow already at or near year-end targets set by many Wall Street professionals, some strategists predicted prices would soon level off for a time.</p>
<p>&quot;As was the case last year, equity prices have risen substantially during a brief period, about 20 percent since November 1996 and 10 percent since January,&quot; Abby Joseph Cohen, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.'s investment policy committee co-chair, said in a new report.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe equity prices could enter a trading range,&quot; Cohen said, warning that &quot;as was the case in 1996, this would be accompanied by notable volatility and rotation of portfolio holdings.&quot;</p>
<p>During Asian trading the dollar peaked at 124.82 yen, a level not seen since February 1992, but quickly retreated after word spread on trading floors that the Bank of Japan had expressed interest in selling dollars at 125 yen.</p>
<p>The dollar ended at 1.6880 German marks, up from 1.6830 late Thursday, and at 124.33 yen vs. 124.25.</p>
<p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange, March crude oil futures rose 39 cents to $22.41 a barrel. March heating oil gained 0.89 cent to 60.81 cents, and March gasoline jumped 1.07 cents to 64.25 cents.</p>
<p>April gold on the NYMEX's Comex division ended up $3.70 an ounce at $346.70.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index closed 13.9 points higher at 4,341.0, up 33.2 from last week. In Tokyo, the key Nikkei 225 average closed up 33.94 points or 0.18 percent at 18,722.00, rising 854.96 from last week.</p>
