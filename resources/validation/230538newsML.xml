<headline>Russian delays support Med crude, buyers await Ira.</headline>

<p>Mediterranean sour crudes were firm on Tuesday, underpinned by delayed Russian loadings, but talk was thin with buyers hanging back in anticipation of a softer market once Iraqi exports resume.</p>
<p>Berth number one at Russia's Novorossiisk Black Sea port reopened early on Tuesday after a 24-hour shutdown due to high winds, but the queue of crude tankers waiting to load stretched to 10 vessels, including five million-barrel carriers, shipping sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Buyers are a little more relaxed with the port reopening, but it's possible that only three vessels will be able to load before the berth shuts for maintenance,&quot; said a trader with an oil major.</p>
<p>The berth, the only one at Novorossiisk which can accommodate large crude tankers, is due to close for two weeks on December 9.</p>
<p>Shipping sources also said a pipeline feeding the port would close for 85 hours during December but further details of the timing were not available.</p>
<p>Other traders said benchmark sour Russian Urals was still worth about Dated Brent less 10 cents a barrel cif Augusta, but talk on both sides of the market was thin.</p>
<p>One trader said the shutdown may be delayed slightly to allow the backlog of vessels to clear. Alternatively, crude supply to berth one may be prioritised at the expense of vessels due to load at berth two, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not willing to buy at current prices,&quot; said a Med refiner, adding that prices for Iraqi Kirkuk crude released last week looked attractive by comparison.</p>
<p>&quot;We were a lifter of Kirkuk before (the 1990 embargo) and would like to lift it again,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>A Baghdad official said Tuesday the first Iraqi oil exports since the Gulf War could be shipped to world markets next week after &quot;initial contracts&quot; were signed with 50 international firms.</p>
<p>Potential European customers said they were unaware of any deals being finalised. Representatives of a number of European refiners are making their way to Baghdad this week.</p>
<p>European traders expected Iraqi state oil firm SOMO to sign contracts with 25-30 companies for an average of 15,000-20,000 barrels per day, with lifters taking a standard 500,000-barrel cargo each month or a million-barrel stem every two months.</p>
