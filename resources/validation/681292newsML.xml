<p>France said on Monday that it was giving logistical support to African peacekeepers in the Central African Republic's capital Bangui after attacks by disaffected local troops in clashes that have killed about 30 people.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux confirmed at a news briefing that France had intervened with &quot;limited logistical support&quot; for the peacekeepers after the troops started firing mortars at Chadian and Senegalese positions on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>The African peacekeepers were deployed in the city under a January peace deal to end the country's third army mutiny in under a year. France, the former colonial power, has 1,650 troops stationed in Bangui under a bilateral defence pact.</p>
<p>Around 70 people have been wounded in the fighting, including five French citizens hit on Saturday when stray mortar bombs fell on the French embassy compound.</p>
<p>Doutriaux called for a halt to the violence and said France hoped that mediator Amadou Toumani Toure would succeed in putting the peace process and the disarming of the former mutineers back on track.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to hope that the General Amadou Toumani Toure... who is returning to Bangui this morning, will manage to restart the peace process and obtain the handing over of all weapons,&quot; Doutriaux said.</p>
<p>&quot;France urges the ex-mutineers not to persist in their blindness which is leading their country to its downfall and calls on all the parties to respect their engagements made last January,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mutinies in April and May 1996 began as protests over pay but became a movement to topple President Ange-Felix Patasse, a northern civilian elected in 1993. The third mutiny began in November and degenerated into ethnic bloodshed.</p>
<p>French troops restored order after the last mutiny and then handed over to the peacekeepers. The African force includes soldiers from Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon, Mali, Senegal and Togo.</p>
