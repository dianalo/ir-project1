<title>JAPAN: Arafat blames Israel for peace process standstill.</title>

<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Thursday blamed Israel for the standstill in the Middle East peace process, calling its attitude a breach of an international agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a bilateral agreement between the PLO and Israel but an international agreement,&quot; Arafat told U.S. cable television network CNN in an interview.</p>
<p>Arafat's four-day visit to Tokyo, which began on Tuesday, comes just one week after his landmark meeting and handshake with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. &quot;The meeting was positive, but the results up to now are zero,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>Arafat avoided commenting on his impression of Netanyahu, saying he respected the democratic choice of the Israeli people, but stressed that the Middle East peace process was not a matter of negotiation with Netanyahu.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not asking for the moon. We're only asking for an international resolution to be implemented,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Arafat, who in January became the first democratically chosen Palestinian leader, is touring the world appealing for pressure on the Israeli leader.</p>
<p>The Palestinians want implementation of the 1993 Oslo agreement on an Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron and other areas of the West Bank, and the opening of a passage for Palestinians to travel between the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>Israel has stressed that self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank cannot go ahead unless its security needs are satisfied.</p>
<p>Asked about Israeli plans to build new housing units in the disputed area, Arafat said: &quot;That is a clear breach of what has been agreed upon.&quot;</p>
<p>He repeated his call for the international community, particularly Japan, to push forward the peace process.</p>
<p>Arafat was due to meet Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto later on Thursday.</p>
<p>Japan has diplomatic relations with Israel but does not officially recognise the Palestine Liberation Organisation.</p>
