<title>GERMANY: Porsche may make sport utility car alone.</title>
<headline>Porsche may make sport utility car alone.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT, Germany</dateline>
<text>
<p>Porsche AG, maker of the famed sports car, is willing to develop a sport utility vehicle by itself after efforts to find a partner have fallen through, Chairman Wendelin Wiedeking told a newspaper Thursday.</p>
<p>Wiedeking told the Handelsblatt newspaper that improved economic conditions made it possible for the company to produce such a vehicle on its own, assuming certain conditions were met.</p>
<p>Porsche had previously said it was in talks with Mercedes-Benz to jointly produce a sport utility vehicle in the United States based on the Mercedes M-Class.</p>
<p>The talks collapsed in January because of concerns at Mercedes that the car would not be profitable enough.</p>
<p>Wiedeking said production of a sport utility car would give Porsche's sales a new dimension, making it less dependent on what can be a fickle sports car market.</p>
<p>Porsche currently makes only two models, the 911 and the recently introduced Boxster.</p>
