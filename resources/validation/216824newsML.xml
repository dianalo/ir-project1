<p>Canada, impatient with indecision on the eastern Zaire refugee crisis, on Tuesday proposed that a military headquarters for relief operations be set up in Uganda.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, announcing the proposal, also said Canada would push for air drops in Zaire to help those most affected.</p>
<p>But he made no mention of establishing corridors on the ground in Zaire to help more refugees return and to enable relief agencies deliver aid to refugees and displaced Zaireans.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no clear-cut agreement on specific measures. Many are still claiming that they need more information,&quot; Axworthy told reporters with Defence Minister Doug Young at his side.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council mandated a Canadian-led military force for eastern Zaire on Nov. 15, but the subsequent return of about 600,000 refugees into Rwanda and confusion over how many remained has caused lengthy reassessment.</p>
<p>&quot;Our view is that there needs to be some decisions soon on a course of action,&quot; added the minister, who together with Young has been forging the international response to the crisis in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;So we'll be proposing to our partners -- and we hope we can get some closure in the next 24 hours -- that we go ahead with the establishment of a military headquarters operation in Entebbe (Uganda) to help coordinate matters and prepare for future actions, including reconnaissance flights into Zaire,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said Canada would also &quot;see if we can gain agreement to undertake a form of air drops into Zaire to assist refugees who have the most serious food needs.&quot;</p>
<p>The ministers did not criticise Rwanda, where most of the refugees are from, but that country's decision not to welcome a military force has made planning more difficult.</p>
<p>Military planners, led by Canadian Lt.-Gen. Maurice Baril, had been hoping to set up a headquarters in the Rwandan capital Kigali and to gain ground access to Zaire from neighbouring Rwanda.</p>
<p>Uganda also borders on Zaire, but does not have easy road links with the area the refugees are in.</p>
<p>The Rwandan government has argued that most refugees have returned, but a military planning meeting in Stuttgart during the weekend concluded that at least 250,000 refugees remained, in addition to Zaireans displaced within their own country.</p>
<p>Axworthy conceded he could not even guarantee agreement on these initial steps. &quot;I think some of the countries are willing to work with us. Others still have questions.&quot;</p>
<p>Young said Canada and the United States both already had some troops in Entebbe. He did not give numbers, but several hundred soldiers are there now.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no formal control-and-command operation in place yet because any of these decisions have to be agreed to by the steering committee that was part of the U.N. mandate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Axworthy said going forward with the headquarters and food drops were steps that could be taken in light of the continued questions on the part of some nations -- which he did not identify.</p>
