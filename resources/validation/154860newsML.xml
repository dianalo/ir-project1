<title>BELGIUM: Sound finances crucial for EMU, Duisenberg says.</title>

<p>Dutch central bank governor Wim Duisenberg, the future head of the European Monetary Institute, warned on Wednesday against one-off, last-ditch efforts to qualify for the European single currency.</p>
<p>Stable and sound long-term finance was more important, he told the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>He said it would be difficult to allow an EU country to take part in the single currency if it met the three-percent budget deficit criterion but medium-term forecasts showed government finances would get out of hand again.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he said, &quot;if a country in 1997 achieved very, very close to the three percent criterion and the medium-term position would indicate it was firmly on its way down to below three percent, that might facilitate admission to the group.&quot;</p>
<p>Duisenberg, who takes over at the head of the EMI from July 1997, told committee members it was essential that national governments stick to the precise convergence criteria for monetary union set out in the European Union's Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>But these criteria were not the only factors that had to be taken into account in deciding whether to admit member states to the single currency in 1999, he said.</p>
<p>Stable and sound long-term finances were also essential.</p>
<p>&quot;If we want to create a stable currency, the criteria have to be adhered to. This is a signal convergence has been achieved. But...we're not handling this as book-keepers and the treaty does not require us to.&quot;</p>
<p>Most EU countries are engaged in desperate efforts to meet the strict budget deficit criterion included in the Maastricht treaty, prompting criticism that the efforts will be short lived.</p>
<p>France, in particular, is under pressure because of its plan to use a one-off payment by state-controlled telecommunications operator France Telecom to reduce its deficit in 1997 -- the reference year for qualifying for the single currency.</p>
