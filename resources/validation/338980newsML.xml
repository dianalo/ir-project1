<headline>Sweden's Backstrom says inflation outlook unchanged.</headline>
<dateline>STOCKHOLM 1997-01-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>The governor of Sweden's central bank, Urban Backstrom, said on Tuesday that the outlook for low inflation remained unchanged since its last inflation report in December.</p>
<p>&quot;The conclusion in that report -- that monetary policy is relatively well balanced -- therefore holds good,&quot; Backstrom said in a speech to a Handelsbanken seminar in London that was released in Stockholm.  </p>
<p>At the end of 1996 the underlying rate of inflation was about 1.5 percent and 12-month headline inflation, which was negative for some months later in 1996, was affected by temporary factors, above all the Riksbank's interest rate cuts.</p>
<p>The central bank, the Riksbank, has a target of an inflation rate of two percent with one percentage point flexibility in either direction.</p>
<p>Backstrom said a shift in the composition of demand began in 1996 with private consumption continuing to rise at a subdued by stable rate and its composition shifting in favour of durable goods, to cars in particular.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no signs in the coming two years the economy will exceed the level of potential output at which inflation is liable to pick up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The level of inflation expectations is also compatible with the inflation target.&quot;</p>
<p>The Swedish crown has been weaker than assumed it would be in the bank's last quarterly inflation report that was released on December 17.</p>
<p>&quot;The current level of the effective exchange rate does not mirror fundamental trends in the economy,&quot; Backstrom said.</p>
<p>&quot;This points to some further appreciation. Meanwhile GDP growth in 1996 seems to have been somewhat lower than the Riksbank counted on, which implies a somewhat larger output gap.&quot;  </p>
<p>Backstrom said temporary exchange rate fluctations hardly affected forecasts of inflation one to two years ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;More lasting tendencies have an overall impact on demand and thereby on the output gap and consequently on the inflation forecast,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the better prospects for inflation had paved the way for significant cuts in the bank's key interest rate, the repo rate, in 1996. The repo rate started the year at 8.91 percent but was trimmed to its current level of 4.10 percent.</p>
<p>Backstrom said the bank was continuing to evaluate the effects of these interest rate cuts together with new information about real economic activity, inflation expectations and the exchange rate.</p>
<p>&quot;This in turn will determine the future course of monetary policy, that is whether the repo rate should be kept at its present level or whether there is any limited room for manoeuvre,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Backstrom said the Swedish economy was in the process of adjusting to the conditions that apply in a low inflation regime which is being accompanied by an appreciable improvement in government finance.</p>
<p>For 1996 it seemed the government deficit had been reduced to between 3.0-3.5 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>&quot;Moreover the improvement is expected to continue,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The consolidation of government finance was proceeding successfully, Backstrom said, with the goal of balance in 1998 of &quot;utmost importance&quot; to lay a foundation for balanced, sustainable growth.</p>
