<p>The trend towards flattening yield curves in Britain and the U.S. will continue near term as more interest rate rises lift short end returns and low inflation keeps a lid on the long end, economists said on Friday.</p>
<p>But persistently low interest rates in core Europe ahead of monetary union will stop yield curves in Germany and France from jumping on the flattening band wagon, at least until after 1999, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;The realisation of lower global inflation is going to have an effect on long bond yields,&quot; said Brian Venables, senior bond analyst at ABN AMRO in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the UK can invert slightly more. And certainly the U.S. curve can potentially go flatter as well. The Fed has a tightening bias which limits the gains at the shorter end and there's still good news to feed into the long bond.&quot;</p>
<p>The spread between two-year and 30-year Treasuries was quoted at 69 basis points by 1115 GMT, compared with 77 basis points just before the U.S. raised interest rates on March 25.</p>
<p>The British gilt curve has already inverted in parts with 25-year gilts yielding 6.93 percent, 20-year gilts yielding 7.0 percent and three-year gilts higher still at 7.12 percent.</p>
<p>Venables suggested investors head for the long end of the gilt and Treasury curves to take advantage of the flattening trend.</p>
<p>Andrew Bevan, senior bond economist at Goldman Sachs in London, noted that yield curves were flattening at lower levels than in the past, thanks to the trend towards lower global inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;In the U.S. and UK, the curves have a tendency to flatten whenever yields get to around the seven percent level,&quot; he said. &quot;That's indicative of the fact the market is very confident monetary policy will keep inflation to three percent or less.&quot;</p>
<p>But Bevan noted low interest rates in core Europe as part of the drive to meet deficit targets for EMU, meant French and German curves were unlikely to flatten ahead of 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;It's interesting that the market continues to push back any idea that interest rates will revert to more normal levels until European Monetary Union (EMU) is off the ground,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Venables agreed. &quot;I don't think core Europe will flatten substantially ahead of EMU. The budget deficit debates in France and Germany are leaving too big a hole so the market won't take the chance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Convergence may carry on but we will have to maintain a steep yield curve irrespective of inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>Venables said the longer end of the curves in Germany and France were the best places to be for investors in core Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the steepness of the yield curve, the longer the better,&quot; he said. &quot;The yield give up is just too big -- you'd underperform the benchmark too much if you stay short.&quot;</p>
<p>Michael Burke, bond strategist at Citibank, was more sceptical of the scope for further curve flattening in the UK as he saw the front end of the curve pricing in too steep an interest rate rise.</p>
<p>&quot;The risk is the gilt market is running ahead of itself at the short end, the long end more accurately reflects likely inflation expectations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The inversion in the gilt market won't last very long.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he would head for the long end of the curve where the downside risk was very limited. &quot;There's a very big buying opportunity at 7.25 percent at the long end,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts noted Germany and France had a fairly flat money curve up to 1998 maturities, but thereafter they steepened out.</p>
<p>Under European Monetary Union (EMU), participating countries' money curves should be broadly the same. And with short end yields in Italy way above those in Germany -- the two year spread is still at 292 basis points -- a degree of short end convergence is yet to come, analysts said.</p>
<p>They agreed it would result both from the German yield curve moving up and the Italian curve moving down.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect to get convergence to a common curve somewhere in between those two extremes, which markets to some extent are pricing in,&quot; said Bevan.</p>
