<p>Asian dollar deposit rates were quietly steady in lacklustre trade, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>Most traders were sidelined ahead of tonight's release of the U.S. April housing starts figures, which are forecast to be around 1.43 million annualised units compared with 1.425 million units reported in March, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates were steady to a little bit softer today on some position adjustments in the morning. The market is now waiting for fresh clues to market direction from tonight's release of the housing starts figures,&quot; a local dealer said.  </p>
<p>&quot;But I don't think there will be much impact as the numbers have been built into the market and most people have squared their positions for the weekend,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In day-to-day rates, weekend slipped 1/8 percentage point to 5-9/16 5-7/16 percent. Monday/Tuesday and week-fixed eased 1/16 point each to a common 5-5/8 5-1/2 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Among longer dates, one-month was unchanged from Thursday's 5-11/16 5-9/16 percent, three-months unchanged at 5-13/16 5-11/16, nine-months unchanged at 6-1/8 6 percent and twelve-months unchanged at 6-1/4 6-1/8 percent.</p>
