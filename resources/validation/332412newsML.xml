<p>Vietnam's Communist Party could have imposed a media blackout on the blockbuster corruption trial which opened in Ho Chi Minh City this week.</p>
<p>It didn't.</p>
<p>Instead, the image of once-swaggering business leaders and officials now reduced to frightened defendants in the dock was splashed across the front pages of daily newspapers and shown repeatedly in television news bulletins.</p>
<p>Analysts said on Friday that the high-profile coverage of the Tamexco case signalled the ruling Communist Party's determination to stamp out a scourge which has damaged its credibility, fed internal political rivalry and alienated foreign investors.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is keen to show an iron fist against corruption because the public image of the party is at stake here,&quot; said one foreign diplomat in Hanoi.</p>
<p>&quot;It's also worried that foreign investors will get fed up and go somewhere else,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Vietnam's sprawling bureaucracy and business world is said to be riddled from top to bottom with bribery, secret deals and cronyism.</p>
<p>According to one report, a commission on corruption found more than over $110 million in bribes were paid out from embezzled funds in 1995 involving 2,500 state agencies and companies. That in a country where the average income per head is just $275 a year.</p>
<p>The much-awaited Tamexco trial, which follows more than a year of investigations into how some $40 million vanished from a party-affiliated company, began on Thursday.</p>
<p>Twenty people, accused of crimes ranging from embezzlement and influence-peddling to gambling away state finances, face various sentences including the death penalty if found guilty.</p>
<p>As the trial got under way, one of the party's most senior figures called on the country's judiciary to be bold in rooting out and punishing cases of corruption, but also fair.</p>
<p>&quot;Only by doing this can the control body help restore people's declining confidence in the state and the government,&quot; National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh told a meeting of the Supreme People's Inspectorate.</p>
<p>Analysts said the comment was a telling indication of the party's concern that it is losing popular respect.</p>
<p>Anxious to affirm its leading role, the party moved at a landmark congress last year to tighten controls on a society now straining at the leash after a decade of growing prosperity and exposure to the outside world.</p>
<p>There has been a blitz on pornography, prostitution, drug abuse and gambling, access to satellite television has been restricted and a drive has been launched to plant party cells in every walk of business and social life.</p>
<p>Foreign investors, who have now earmarked some $22 billion for projects in Vietnam, welcome moves to tackle corruption. Many complain that doors often only open when kickbacks get paid.</p>
<p>But they worry about the implications of tighter control.</p>
<p>&quot;What the party congress has done is give the forces of control a renewed mandate, and foreign business and others are suffering increased harassment by agencies of the Ministry of the Interior...&quot; Australian ambassador to Vietnam Susan Boyd said in a recent speech.</p>
<p>&quot;This is also providing increased opportunities for extortion and corruption,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Although the Communist leadership presents a united front, Vietnam watchers say the issue of corruption has become a political tool, usually wielded behind closed doors.</p>
<p>In November reform-minded prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, called in a rousing speech for proper recognition of his constitutional right to punish corrupt officials.</p>
<p>Days later, a senior aide to party chief Do Muoi slammed the prime minister for being long on rhetoric and short on ideas.</p>
