<p>A Florida judge Friday told Liggett Group Inc. to turn over documents connected to the company's settlement with 22 state attorneys general for review in a smokers' class-action lawsuit.</p>
<p>Dade Circuit Judge Alan Postman told attorneys for Liggett to deliver the documents by April 7 for in camera review in the tobacco case known as Engle vs R.J. Reynolds, filed on behalf of hundreds of thousands of Florida smokers.</p>
<p>&quot;I will keep them under seal,&quot; Postman told lawyers during a pretrial hearing Friday. The case is scheduled for trial Sept. 8.</p>
<p>Postman also said the Liggett settlement would not at this point affect the Engle case. Liggett is trying to use the settlement to settle all individual smokers' lawsuits against the company, but attorneys in the Engle case have said they will not be a part of any settlement.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Dade Circuit Judge Robert Kaye also ordered Liggett to turn over the documents in the tobacco class-action known as Broin vs. Philip Morris, a case in which flight attendants claim they were sickened by secondhand cigarette smoke on the job. Kaye gave Liggett until Wednesday.</p>
<p>The documents, thought by plaintiffs' attorneys to be a potential horde of damaging evidence, were part of a settlement last week between Liggett and 22 state attorneys general in which Liggett conceded cigarettes are harmful to health and agreed to help in lawsuits against the industry.</p>
<p>Miami attorney Stanley Rosenblatt asked Postman to declare the Liggett settlment &quot;a nullity with regard to Engle,&quot; arguing that Liggett could not use the national settlement to effectively opt out as a defendant in the Engle case.</p>
<p>Liggett attorney Marie Santacroce objected to Postman entering an order declaring the Liggett settlement a nullity, asking for time to prepare a brief to explain why the settlement would properly settle all claims against the tobacco company.</p>
<p>Rosenblatt has said the plaintiffs in Broin and Engle would not be a part of any Liggett settlement. He said he met with Liggett Chairman Bennett LeBow and the company attorney Thursday but was not persuaded to join the settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;That was the purpose (of the meeting), to get me on board the Alabama settlement. They did not get me on board,&quot; Rosenblatt told Reuters.</p>
<p>Postman said he would not enter an order on the &quot;nullity&quot; issue for at least a week, but indicated the settlement would not affect the Engle case.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not saying it's a nullity. I'm just saying they (Alabama courts) don't have jurisdiction,&quot; Postman said. &quot;At this time the class action is going to proceed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alabama will do what Alabama wants to do and Florida will do what it has to do to protect its citizens,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Defendants in the Engle suit include Philip Morris Cos Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp, a unit of B.A.T Industries Plc, Lorillard Tobacco Co., a unit of Loews Corp. and Liggett Group Inc., a unit of LeBow's Brooke Group Ltd.</p>
