<p>Fears over President Boris Yeltsin's health drove down Russian stocks and bonds for the second day on Tuesday as investors prepared for a prolonged period of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Leading stocks such as Mosenergo and Rostelekom fell up to eight percent before bouncing back.</p>
<p>&quot;It is really crashing, moving down with even some panic among brokers. Some were selling at bid levels and without big volumes. Because of that, the market went down significantly,&quot; said Alexei Genkin, sales desk manager at Alfa-Capital.</p>
<p>&quot;It could stabilise at some point, even recover a bit, but the downward trend will continue for some days.&quot;</p>
<p>Nick Mokhoff, head trader at Alliance-Menatep, said prices were still higher than some weeks ago but added: &quot;My own concern is that the next news that comes out will not be positive so I would rather not be long in this market.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The major concern is not only Yeltsin's health but what happens in a second round of elections,&quot; he said. If Yeltsin is incapacitated, elections must be held within three months.</p>
<p>MinFin bonds also eased in early trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeltsin is still the only reason for the fall,&quot; Inkombank dealer Alexander Nikolayev said.</p>
<p>Stocks and bonds fell on Monday after further revelations about the health of the 65-year-old Kremlin leader who is preparing for heart surgery.</p>
<p>Top surgeon Renat Akchurin, who is widely expected to perform the bypass operation, said it might be delayed for up to two months or not take place at all. He also said there was evidence that Yeltsin had suffered a third heart attack between the two rounds of the presidential election this summer.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not know of anyone who has recovered from three heart attacks and had a normal way of life,&quot; said Gavin Rankin, head of research at Troika-Dialog.</p>
<p>Rankin said prolonged uncertainty could see foreign investors, although used to turbulence in Russia, selling off. &quot;The market will not improve until something becomes clarified.&quot;</p>
<p>Moscow-based Renaissance Capital said in a newsletter on Monday that investors should begin preparing for the post-Yeltsin era and considering how power might be transferred and who might stand in any new elections.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's Communist rivals have seized upon the health issue, urging him to step down if he is too ill to rule.</p>
<p>But Rankin said he did not believe an election would bring a communist to power. &quot;I do not believe that Zyuganov really has any chance of coming through for a second time,&quot; he said in a reference to Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.</p>
<p>Analysts say that despite the communists' calls, the fear associated with Yeltsin's health is not that economic reform could be reversed.</p>
<p>&quot;What people do not like is a period of uncertainty that means focus is deflected from the economy. It means a period of political uncertainty and all that is definitely negative for the market,&quot; said Rankin. &quot;We have no actual end to this period in sight.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin's problems have led to talk of a power struggle between premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, national security chief Alexander Lebed and Kremlin chief of staff Anatoly Chubais.</p>
<p>&quot;Lebed is viewed with uncertainty in the West because he is an unknown quantity and that comes from his naivety in economic issues. He has to go through a period of learning... My assumption is that he will come through,&quot; said Rankin.</p>
