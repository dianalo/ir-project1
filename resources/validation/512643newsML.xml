<p>Snakes may actually be distantly descended from giant sea monsters that died out with the other dinosaurs, scientists said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said a 97-million-year-old lizard whose bones were found in Israel may actually be one of the earliest snakes, and said they had &quot;surprising and compelling&quot; evidence that the nearest relative of snakes were marine mosasauroids-- big swimming sea-lizards.</p>
<p>Michael Caldwell, a palaeontologist at the Field Museum in Chicago and Michael Lee of the University of Sydney, joined forces to take a second look at Pachyrhachis problematicus, whose fossils had been identified as belonging to an early lizard.</p>
<p>It actually looked more like a snake that still had tiny hind legs, they decided. Nicholas Fraser of the Virginia Museum of Natural History, commenting on the report, noted that some modern boas still have vestigial hindlegs.</p>
<p>Other features of the Israeli fossil indicated it was a snake, not a lizard, Caldwell and Lee said. &quot;Pachyrhachis has a small, narrow, lightly built skull showing most derived features of modern snakes.&quot;</p>
<p>They said careful study of the skeleton showed resemblances to marine mosasauroids, which they said could be, among lizards, the &quot;nearest relatives (ancestors) of snakes&quot;.</p>
