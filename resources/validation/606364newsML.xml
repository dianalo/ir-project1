<p>A Protestant politician accused Britain's new Northern Ireland minister of siding with Irish nationalists on Thursday by saying London would press ahead with peace talks even if the Protestant side walked out.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, seeking to end guerrilla violence and launch all-party talks after just three weeks in office, riled the hardline pro-British Democratic Unionist Party hours after her officials had ended their 16-month ban on contacts with Sinn Fein, the political wing of banned IRA guerrillas.</p>
<p>&quot;She has been giving the impression since she arrived in Northern Ireland that she is favouring the (Roman Catholic) nationalist community,&quot; declared DUP deputy chief Peter Robinson.</p>
<p>&quot;She has taken leave of her senses,&quot; thundered his leader Ian Paisley.</p>
<p>Mowlam, who was later due to fly to Washington for talks with U.S officials and politicians, had signalled that if Unionist politicians boycotted talks in the event of Sinn Fein being allowed in, London would not allow its search for all-round political agreement to be wrecked.</p>
<p>&quot;That is the state of play. However, what we've got to do is to build respect between the communities, trust between the communities and confidence between the communities.</p>
<p>&quot;We will do our best over the days and weeks ahead to do that, and if you can achieve that you could hold everybody in,&quot; she told BBC television.</p>
<p>Some Unionist politicians, already angered by her meetings with Catholic objectors to controversial parades by pro-British Protestants, called on her to clarify her comments.</p>
<p>Robinson said Mowlam seemed to be &quot;bit of a loose cannon, and I think that can be very dangerous in Northern Ireland terms&quot;.</p>
<p>But David Trimble, leader of the largest Protestant group, the Ulster Unionist Party, attempted to calm Unionist worries that the comment might herald a threat by London to impose a solution over the heads of the majority Protestant community.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters in London he portrayed Mowlam's words as an off-the-cuff response. Trimble, a long-time scourge of Sinn Fein and the IRA, said he was optimistic London would not sideline Unionists from peace efforts.</p>
<p>Britain's efforts to get all-party talks, involving Sinn Fein and Unionist groups, were stymied last year by the Irish Republican Army's decision to end a 17-month ceasefire and resuming a bombing and shooting war against rule from London.</p>
<p>London and Dublin, who are partners in plans to achieve an end to decades of communal strife in Northern Ireland, say Sinn Fein will get a place in talks only if the IRA totally abandon violence.</p>
<p>But Unionist groups taking part in multi-party talks that exclude Sinn Fein are sceptical of republican protestations that they want to follow a peaceful path.</p>
<p>The guerrillas want to end British rule in Northern Ireland to unite it with neighbouring Catholic Ireland.</p>
