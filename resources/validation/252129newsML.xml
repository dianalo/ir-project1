<p>The chairman of Esprit Asia Holdings Ltd, Michael Ying, said on Thursday that the company is not worried about its high gearing of 298 percent following its proposed HK$1.83 billion asset acquisition.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't feel the gearing is high and we have always been monitoring the level of interest cover,&quot; Ying told a news briefing, adding he believed the company could paid off all the debts in five years.</p>
<p>After the completion of the acquisition the proforma combined borrowings of the group was expected to be HK$1.43 billion, the fashion retailer said in a statement.</p>
<p>Esprit Asia earlier said it proposed to pay a total of HK$1.83 billion to Worldwide Thousand Ltd (WTL), a company controlled by Ying, and to Jurgen Friedrich for their 100 percent interest in Esprit Far East Ltd, 100 percent in Esprit de Corp Gmbh, five percent in Esprit Holdings Inc, 10 percent in Esprit Japan Ltd and about 63 percent in Esprit International.</p>
<p>The acquisition, priced at a prospective price earnings multiple of 9.8 times, will be financed by a five-year bank loan of HK$1.31 billion, a new share issue worth HK$307.8 million, and internal resources, Ying said.</p>
<p>After the deal, the interest cover, which is calculated as profit before taxation and interest divided by net interest charges, will be about five times in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The management is very comfortable and the banks loaning to us are comfortable so we don't see any pressure, and what is more we don't want to dilute our earnings,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Earning per share was expected to rise by 5.3 cents to 28.2 cents for the year ending June 30, 1997 after the purchase, the company said.</p>
<p>The high gearing ratio resulted partly from the writting off goodwill arising on the acquisition estimated at about HK$580 million, said Wong Wai-ming, a director of an adviser of the deal HSBC Investment Bank Asia Ltd.</p>
<p>He also said Esprit was a strong cash flow operation and the value of its brand name was difficult to measure.</p>
<p>After the acquisitions, WTL's interest in Esprit Asia would be raised to 71 percent from 68 percent, Ying said.</p>
<p>The acquisition plan was subject to shareholders' approval at the special general meeting of shareholders scheduled on January 7, 1997. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6369</p>
