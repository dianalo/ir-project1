<p>IPE Brent futures ended sharply lower on Tuesday as they tracked stiff losses by the NYMEX energy complex, traders said.</p>
<p>July Brent settled 78 cents lower at $19.22 a barrel while June gas oil closed earlier some $5.75 lower at $172.00 a tonne.</p>
<p>Traders said hefty losses by NYMEX futures had pressured IPE Brent lower. The July contract had traded around the $19.70 level for most the session prior to NYMEX's open.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people were saying it would go lower but they weren't prepared to do so without NYMEX,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Traders attributed NYMEX crude's falls to technical weakness as well as an increasingly lacklustre gasoline season.</p>
<p>On the technical front, traders said a break below $21.50 and $21.30 a barrel provoked a sell-off of the NYMEX July contract by a number of funds</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think many of the funds were comfortable below $21.50,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>July NYMEX crude was trading 87 cents off at $20.76 a barrel at 1941 GMT, while June heating oil was 2.22 cents lower at 55.30 cents a gallon and gasoline was 1.57 cents lower at 65.35 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>A lacklustre performance by gasoline at a time when it should be booming was also seen as weighing on the market.</p>
<p>The Memorial Day holiday traditionally marks the shift of the U.S. gasoline season into top gear and the start of bumper prices for producers, but so far the scamble for material seen last year has failed to materialise.</p>
<p>IPE Traders said that news earlier on in the session that Shell had cut crude runs by roughly 14 percent at its Pernis refinery due to poor margins had also put a dampener on Brent futures.</p>
<p>Shell's move comes in the footsteps of run cuts by BP and Texaco at their joint Nerefco refinery in Rotterdam last week. -- London Newsroom, +44 171 542 7714.</p>
