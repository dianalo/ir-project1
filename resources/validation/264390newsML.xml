<p>U.S. mutual funds will experience more modest returns in 1997 compared with the robust stretch in 1995-1996, fund tracker Michael Lipper predicted on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, forecast returns of 10-12 percent for general equity funds.  &quot;I'm looking for a return to historical comparisons,&quot; around that level, Lipper told reporters at a press briefing here.</p>
<p>Through December 12, the general equity fund has returned an average 18.03 percent year to date.  In 1995, the average equity fund returned 31.08 percent.  </p>
<p>For the five-year period, stock funds have returned a cumulative 105.99 percent.</p>
<p>Lipper said that he expects fixed-income funds to record modest returns in 1997, likely no more than the value of their &quot;coupons,&quot; or portfolio yields.</p>
<p>In answer to a question, Lipper said he expected assets in money market funds to grow next year.  Lipper said some of that growth may come from investors who sell holdings in stock funds, especially growth funds.  </p>
<p>According to the Investment Company Institute, an industry trade group, money market funds had assets of about $876 billion at the end of October.  Stock funds assets totaled about $1.651 trillion, and bond funds had assets of about $866 billion.</p>
<p>While there will continue to be a healthy flow of cash into funds next year, Lipper said he expected the stream to slow next year versus 1996.  He explained that the majority of Fortune 500 companies have completed conversions from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans, which have been a major source of cash into funds.  </p>
<p>The conversions provided a one-time giant push of money into funds.</p>
<p>Lipper predicted that if the U.S. stock market were flat to slightly higher, world equity funds would outperform U.S. equity funds.  World equity funds have returned about 10.45 percent year to date.</p>
<p>Lipper said that if the market declined, he would expect technology sector funds to be especially hard hit, and take about 28 months to recover.</p>
