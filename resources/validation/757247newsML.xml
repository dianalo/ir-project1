<p>Following are some of the main factors likely to affect Philippine stocks on Friday:</p>
<p>* The market's weakness is seen persisting as investors remained wary of high interest rates and would rather wait for more company earnings to be released, traders said.</p>
<p>* &quot;People are disappointed because they were expecting rates to be cut.  Everyone's holding off any positioning until rates are lowered,&quot; said Cilette Liboro, research head at Orion-Squire Capital.</p>
<p>* BPI Securities Corp expect critical support at 2,475 points.  </p>
<p>* On Thursday, the Philippine composite index closed sharply lower by 63.57 points at 2,572.80 points.</p>
<p>* The Dow Jones on Thursday ended 28.57 points higher at 8,116.93.  PLDT's ADR closed up $0 1/2 at $33.</p>
<p>* The Philippine peso ended lower at 28.47 to a dollar vs the previous close of 28.</p>
<p>* The Philippine interbank call loan average was slightly lower at 25.03125 percent versus 25.0625 percent.</p>
<p>* Philippine treasury bills drifted in the secondary market on Thursday as the call money market continued to pull the cash, traders said. Bids on 91-day bills ranged from 13.5 percent to 13.75 compared with 13.4 to 14 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>* Metropolitan Bank &amp; Trust Co said its first six months net income was at 2.72 billion pesos compared with 2.03 billion the previous year. Analysts said the bank should remain the industry leader in the Philippines despite competition and uncertainty in financial markets.</p>
<p>* Benpres Holdings Corp said it expects its net income in 1997 to reach 2.69 billion pesos compared with 2.01 billion the previous year.</p>
<p>* Filipino banker Edgardo Espiritu and a group of American and Malaysian investors have bought into local exploration firm Alcorn Petroleum and Minerals Corp, company officials said.</p>

<p>* Rockwell Land Corp, a unit of the Manila Electric Co said it posted a net income of 298.48 million pesos as of end-June this year.</p>
<p>* Newspaper BusinessWorld said the central bank is expected to keep interest rates high in the near term as the foreign exchange market has yet to return to more &quot;normal&quot; trading conditions.</p>
<p>* The Philippine Star said quoting central bank deputy governor Alberto Reyes that the bank is issuing a directive requiring banks to get prior approval to enter into options agreement in a bid to further tighten the noose on derivatives transactions.</p>
<p>* Times Journal said Kuok Philippine Properties Inc and its Malaysian partner Pelangi Berhad are investing an additional 448.5 million pesos into their real estate joint venture project in Cavite, north of Manila.</p>
