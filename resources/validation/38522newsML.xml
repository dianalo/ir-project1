<headline>FOCUS - Axa buys Generali's 10.8 pct Axa stake.</headline>

<p>French insurer Axa said on Friday it had bought out Italian insurer Generali's 10.8 percent stake in Axa for 5.9 billion francs ($1.16 billion), bringing down the curtain on efforts by the two companies for closer cooperation.</p>
<p>The French insurer said Generali had wanted to sell its Axa stake as it no longer considered it to be a strategic holding and that it exercised its preemptive right to buy the stock.</p>
<p>Just last March, Axa and Generali signed a shareholder pact under which Generali reaffirmed its intention to maintain its holding in Axa at its present level.</p>
<p>But Generali had long expressed dissatisfaction about its participation in Axa, last year threatening to sell its stake if it was not allowed to become a more active partner.</p>
<p>The two groups had intended to cooperate internationally but this never materialised.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Axa announced a restructuring as a result of which Generali transformed its indirect holding in Axa into a direct holding to make it more liquid.</p>
<p>Axa said Friday's purchase eliminated the risk of large quantities of its shares coming onto the market and weighing on the share price.</p>
<p>Investors responded with relief, pushing up Axa shares 4.1 francs to 289.10 francs by mid-morning. &quot;There was concern it (the stake) might have gone on the market but they've bypassed the market,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>The purchase was carried out at a minimum price of 285 francs per share, which Axa said gave Generali &quot;a significant capital gain.&quot;</p>
<p>It said Generali had started to acquire Axa shares from 1988 at an average price of 250 francs, not considering changes in exchange rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The price of 285 francs was considered attractive by Axa, given the potential worth of Axa shares linked to its prospects of profitability and growth,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Axa shares were up 4.1 francs at 289.10 francs by mid-morning. Shares in Generali were up 455 lira at 33,350.</p>
<p>Axa was reported to have offered to buy the Italian group's stake in July for 285 francs but at that time, Generali chairman Antoine Bernheim refused, arguing that Axa shares were capable of showing a strong increase in value.</p>
<p>Axa chairman Claude Bebear said then that Axa's talks with Generali had not produced &quot;any significant collaboration&quot; between the two of the kind sought by the Italian group.</p>
<p>Axa said, however, on Friday that &quot;considering the good relationship between both groups,&quot; it had asked Bernheim to stay on its board.</p>
