<p>An official of athletics' world governing body criticised Greek television producers on Thursday for broadcasting close-up pictures around the world of an embarrassed runner battling to conceal her breasts.</p>
<p>Ernest Obeng, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF)'s TV production co-ordinator said: &quot;I wouldn't have done it and if it happened again I would ask television not to show it. It was in bad taste.&quot;</p>
<p>Other IAAF officials were also unhappy about the pictures.</p>
<p>The incident occured in the first heat of the women's 5,000 metres and concerned 18-year-old Habtemariam Nebiat, the first female athlete from Eritrea to compete in the championships.</p>
<p>She was running without a bra in a borrowed man's vest with cut-away sides which was clearly too large for her.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as she started to run, her breasts were exposed and she spent most of the 18 minutes it took her to complete her race trying to cover them up.</p>
<p>With only three runners left to finish, and with the winners long ago in the tunnel, TV cameras focused in on her obvious discomfort and embarrassment.</p>
<p>The live pictures were shown on two giant screens in the stadium which brought cheers and jeers from the Greek crowd. The athlete was close to tears after the race and would not comment on the incident.</p>
<p>George Karageorgiou, the senior producer of ERT -- Greece's national broadcasting service responsible for providing the TV pictures to the rest of the world -- claimed it was not his decision to show the pictures.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no alternative,&quot; he said. &quot;We show a close-up of every athlete in the last 100 metres if we can and there was no reason why we would not show her.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not agree the pictures were in bad taste, it is our job to show what is going on on the track.&quot;</p>
