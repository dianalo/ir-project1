<p>Standard and Poor's local currency debt ratings for Asian banks based on public information are a useful, if not perfect, new tool for international investors, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of reasonably conservative investors that don't want to jump into what they consider emerging markets,&quot; said Imre Speizer, director of local fixed income trading for SBC Warburg in Singapore.</p>
<p>&quot;But with an implied rating from S&amp;P, I think it will open the door a little more for them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>S&amp;P on Monday assigned public information ratings to six Singapore banks, 13 Indonesian banks and 14 Philippine banks.</p>
<p>The move followed the rating agency's announcement last week that it would expand its worldwide bank coverage by assigning ratings based on information available to the public.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said it would assign about 250 new bank ratings, mostly in emerging markets, in the next year.</p>
<p>It said the new ratings would be distinguished from its full debt ratings, which involve lengthy consultations with the issuer, by a &quot;pi&quot; attached to the familiar letter grade.</p>
<p>It will assess Japanese regional banks in December. Hong Kong, Malaysian and Thai banks will be rated in January, with Taiwan banks set to receive grades shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing a lot of investors that want to know more about the bank issuers, and I think that the ratings that S&amp;P have given them will provide them with a level of comfort,&quot; said Damien Wood, assistant director at Peregrine Fixed Income in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Graeme Lee, S&amp;P managing director in Melbourne, said the new ratings are an extension of the agency's risk evaluation service, which provides similar public information-based assessments using a less precise scale than the letter grades.</p>
<p>Analysts cautioned that while unsolicited ratings are useful, they are less thorough than traditional ratings.</p>
<p>&quot;They are still a long way off from being as useful as a proper rating because the big problem in this part of the world is the lack of disclosure of meaningful information,&quot; said SBC's Speizer.</p>
<p>Such ratings are &quot;basically an information assistance service&quot; that will aid investors that don't have the resources to study the public documents themselves, he said.</p>
<p>Peregrine's Wood said he suspected that the &quot;pi&quot; ratings are a &quot;fairly good indication of what they would be if the agency had been through the full due diligence process&quot;.</p>
<p>But he noted that the possibility of S&amp;P making mistakes is higher with unsolicited ratings.</p>
<p>Rival rating agency Moody's Investors Service already makes assignments that are not solicited by the rated entity, but these are not distinguished from its standard ratings.</p>
<p>&quot;The implication is that we will probably see more ratings coming out of both agencies, which is good for credit analysts and good for investors,&quot; said Evelyn Lam, senior credit analyst at Banque Indosuez in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Many Asian countries have one or more local credit rating agencies that assess a domestic issuer's ability to service debt obligations versus other borrowers in the country.</p>
<p>Analysts said that while local investors rely on the domestic agencies, international investors are more comfortable with the global agencies, which assess each issuer in a worldwide context using standardised criteria.</p>
<p>Banque Indosuez's Lam said that in a best-case scenario the international rating agencies would combine with the domestic agencies to marry proven methodology with local knowledge.</p>
<p>S&amp;P, Moody's and other international rating agencies have provided assistance to some of the local Asian agencies through cooperation agreements and other arrangements.</p>
