<p>European Union countries spent an average 95 billion European currency units ($107 billion) a year between 1992 and 1994 to help their manufacturing industry, transport and other sectors, a European Commission report revealed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Commission, concerned about the growing trend to bail out ailing companies particularly in the manufacturing sector, pointed an accusing finger at the EU's largest nations.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the 'big' countries -- Germany, France, Britain and Italy -- which benefit the most from aid to the industry,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Industry alone swallowed up a total 42.6 billion Ecus annually in the period at stake, almost unchanged from 41.6 billion Ecus between 1990 and 1992.</p>
<p>The Commission said that 92 percent of those subsidies were paid in Germany, Italy and to a lesser extent France and Britain. The report does not include Sweden, Finland and Austria which joined the EU in January 1995.</p>
<p>The study covers subsidies granted by national or regional authorities, not the aid paid out of the EU coffers. Besides the manufacturing industry and transport it also focuses on money spent on fisheries, farming and the coal industry.</p>
<p>The report dismisses a widespread belief that poor countries spend more than their richer neighbours to boost their competitiveness. But it also confirms that Germany is the EU's state aid &quot;champion&quot; mainly because of the restructuring of industries in the states previously under communist rule.</p>
<p>The German central and local authorities granted over 17 billion Ecus annually between 1992-94 to manufacturing industries, or 40 percent of the total spent in the bloc.</p>
<p>In comparison, annual industry subsidies totalled 11.5 billion Ecus in Italy, 6.0 billion Ecus in France and only 1.4 billion Ecus in Britain.</p>
<p>The Commission urged national governments to clamp down on subsidies, saying they had a &quot;perverse&quot; effect on fair competition, were an obstacle to the completion of the bloc's single market and hampered EU states' chances of qualifying for monetary union.</p>
<p>It announced it would soon revise rules on national aid for regional development to shift the focus to the Union's poorest regions and those with high unemployment.</p>
<p>The Commission also warned it would adopt stricter rules on rescue and restructuring aid to ensure that they were truly limited to bringing the company aided back on its feet once and for all.</p>
<p>The Commission, which must clear all national state aid plans, has come under fire for approving huge rescue packages for the German shipbuilding industry and a 20-billion-franc bailout of Air France.</p>
