<p>Greece said on Wednesday it would deport some 100 illegal immigrants from Sri Lanka, Pakistan and India who allege they are the survivors of a ship collision last month off Sicily in which hundreds of their compatriots drowned.</p>
<p>&quot;The immigrants have completed their testimonies and will be deported back to their countries on flights today and on Saturday,&quot; a senior police officer told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said their relatives back home had been notified to expect them and that the government had decided on the deportation late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Some 110 immigrants were arrested near the southern port of Nafplion on December 30 and told police they were involved in a ship collision in the Malta-Sicily channel on Christmas day.</p>
<p>They said nearly 300 fellow travellers on board the Honduran-flagged Yioham were forced at gunpoint to transfer to a smaller ship.</p>
<p>The smaller ship, believed to have been stolen from Malta, was then in collision with the Yioham while manoeuvering and sank. Only 29 people were rescued and the Yioham continued its trip to Greece.</p>
<p>Police and the embassies of Pakistan and India said they believed the immigrants' testimonies and a prosecutor charged three Greek sailors -- crew members of the two ships -- with mass murder. They are all still at liberty.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless something is proved to the contrary, I would say the descriptions are fairly graphic and it seems they all did die. There is no discrepancy in the story that these people have told me,&quot; Indian ambassador in Athens, Gurdip Singh Bedi, told Reuters Television.</p>
<p>Nafplion prosecutor Yannis Provataris also charged eight other people, including foreigners, with illegal movement of immigrants in Greece and said evidence &quot;led to the conclusion there was a collision, a shipwreck, and that many people drowned.&quot;</p>
<p>Police said they had arrested two Indians and a Pakistani involved in the case but gave no further details.</p>
<p>&quot;We took the risk because we want jobs. But we did not know it was going to be such a big risk,&quot; said Indian immigrant Balwinder Singh. &quot;No one could help them. They were crying before my eyes, I saw dead bodies in the water.&quot;</p>
<p>Italian rescue crews have recovered no traces of a shipwreck and a search by the Greek coast guard has failed so far to trace the Yioham.</p>
<p>Court officials said a small number of immigrants would remain in Greece to testify when the case comes to court.</p>
<p>&quot;Interpol has been informed and they are also looking for those charged in the case,&quot; the police official said.</p>
<p>Provataris said those charged with murder were Eftihios Zervoudakis, a sailor and among the rescued, Mihalis Fanourakis and Antonis Sfakianakis, both mechanics on the Yioham.</p>
<p>Also sought by police are Youssef Al Halal, the Yioham's captain and a Lebanese resident of Athens and Marcel Barbara, a Pakistani who reportedly lives in Malta.</p>
<p>The Pakistani embassy has compiled an official report on the shipwreck with the names of 31 Pakistanis who are described as &quot;decesed.&quot; Another list includes 37 Pakistanis, held in Greece who will be among those deported.</p>
<p>Police said immigrants from Sri Lanka had paid $8,000 each in Colombo for an air ticket to Cairo and the sea trip to Europe. The Indians and Pakistanis said they paid $5,000 each.</p>
