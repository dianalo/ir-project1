<p>The AFL-CIO on Tuesday offered millions of dollars to help Teamsters wage a long strike against United Parcel Service, and the company warned of thousands of job losses as both sides dug in for the fight.</p>
<p>The announcement by the huge federation of 78 unions that it would aid the striking Teamsters was a dramatic sign that the nine-day-old strike between one of America's showpiece service industry companies and its biggest union was taking a bitter turn.</p>
<p>&quot;Before the week is out we will have enough loan commitments from other unions, large and small, to finance the worker side of this confrontation for a long strike if that's what it takes,&quot; said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, standing with Teamsters President Ron Carey at Teamster headquarters.</p>
<p>The Atlanta-based company stiffened its position, too, taking out full-page ads in dozens of newspapers to tell its story and warning Teamsters can expect to lose jobs if the strike is not settled quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;We reviewed yesterday the impact of this strike after two weeks, after four weeks and after six months, and the conditions now are that we'll have 15,000 fewer Teamsters jobs if the strike ends in two weeks,&quot; UPS Chief Executive Officer James Kelly told NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show.</p>
<p>&quot;And the longer it goes on, the fewer jobs we'll have, so this is about destroying jobs at UPS,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Despite that, Labour Secretary Alexis Herman told reporters on Air Force One that she was encouraged about prospects for resolving the dispute after meeting with both sides Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm encouraged in that I believe that both sides expressed a willingness to be more flexible in looking at their own differences,&quot; Herman told reporters after briefing President Bill Clinton on Tuesday.</p>
<p>However, no further talks were scheduled.</p>
<p>At a packed news conference in Washington, the Teamsters announced preparations for a long walkout.</p>
<p>Sweeney said he would get help from member unions to cover the $10 million needed each week to pay $55 weekly strike benefits to the 185,000 Teamsters on strike.</p>
<p>UPS normally handles 12 million packages a day -- 80 percent of all packages shipped by ground nationwide -- with a work force of 301,000 people.</p>
<p>Schools and colleges find themselves without textbooks, and many small businesses cannot deliver their goods and are scrambling to find alternative shippers, with little luck.</p>
<p>The union, which says a key issue is permitting more of the three in five workers who now work part-time to become full-time, presented a part-time worker at their news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many weeks that I have been at UPS that I have worked 60 and 65 hours a week but UPS calls me a part-timer and pays me part-time wages,&quot; said Rachel Howard, who picks up and delivers next-day packages in Burtonsville, Md.</p>
<p>&quot;I only qualify for a half-time pension that a full-time worker gets,&quot; she said. Promises made when she started that she could go full-time after two years have not panned out, she said. &quot;I am now in my eighth year and still waiting for a full-time job.&quot;</p>
<p>But the company insists it has done all it can do. UPS wants the union to permit a vote on the final offer made by the company before the strike began.</p>
<p>The Teamsters' Carey insists his union members have already voted.</p>
<p>&quot;UPS should stop trying to dictate and start trying to negotiate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>UPS wrote to all Congress members Monday, asking them to urge Clinton to end the strike.</p>
<p>But the White House has insisted the economic disruption is not great enough to justify intervention under the Taft-Hartley law, last used successfully 25 years ago.</p>
<p>At most, Clinton could ask a judge to enjoin the strike. Presidents have not always succeeded even when they have sought such orders because the government must show that the work stoppage endangers national health or safety.</p>
