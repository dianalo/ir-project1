<p>A senior official with the U.S. Labor Department said Friday there was no reason to believe that data from its employment report had been disseminated ahead of its normal 0830 EST/1330 GMT release time.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reason to think that that was an issue,&quot; Katharine Abraham, commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, said when asked about the possibility of a leak of the data.  </p>
<p>Abraham was speaking to reporters after testifying to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.</p>
<p>Earlier Friday, the Labor Department reported that U.S. nonfarm payrolls grew by 271,000 in January while the unemployment rate rose a tenth of a percentage point to 5.4 percent.</p>
<p>Despite the strong growth in jobs, the report was well received in the bond market.</p>
<p>Participants were reassured by elements of the report, such as the fact that average hourly earnings rose only slightly, that suggested there was no immediate need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.</p>
<p>Talk of a potential leak had circulated among some bond traders in light of an advance in bond prices before the release of the report.</p>
<p>However, traders said the rumor was not widespread and that the activity before the employment report could have been explained by any number of factors.</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever you have significant market activity before a number like this, there are rumors of a leak,&quot; a trader at a large New York investment bank said. &quot;This wasn't anything that stood out or was embarrassing.&quot;</p>
