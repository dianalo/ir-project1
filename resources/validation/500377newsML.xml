<p>Indian Express</p>
<p>LEADERSHIP ISSUE HAMPERS PEACE TALKS</p>
<p>Direct talks between the Congress party and the ruling United Front (UF) failed to achieve any breakthrough. Talks were held for the first time after the Congress withdrew support to the government on March 30. Sources said the issue of Congress's entry in the government immediately was among the proposals. Negotiators said the modalities could be discussed and finalised in the next two days.</p>

<p>The Economic Times</p>
<p>FLAKY RURAL MARKET KILLS BOOM HOPES</p>
<p>The last two years witnessed a decline and slowdown in demand of several consumer goods in rural areas. According to industry estimates, there was a decline in the sale of bicycles and radios in 1996, two consumer products popular in the rural areas as well as among the less affluent urban population. In the case of black and white televisions, another consumer product largely purchased in rural areas, there was a slowdown in consumer offtake, industry sources said.</p>

<p>FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WANT LENDING LIMITS RAISED</p>
<p>Financial institutions (FIs) made a strong pitch with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for an increase in their short-term lending limits and treating bond issues by them as SLR, on par with sovereign debt. FIs argued that these measures would considerably lower their cost of funds, which in turn would lead to a reduction in lending rates by 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent. FIs pushed these issues in recent discussions with the RBI in the run up to the April 15 credit policy.</p>

<p>$1.5 BLN EXTERNAL COMMERCIAL BORROWING FOR OIL, TELECOM</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry would give substantial weightage to external commercial borrowings by the telecommunications and petroleum sectors in 1997/98 (April-March). Sources said the ministry could allocate about $1.5 billion each to both the sectors in 1997/98. The power sector would also get about $1.5 billion in the current financial year.</p>

<p>Financial Express</p>
<p>RESERVE BANK BACKTRACKS ON FARM ADVANCE NORMS</p>
<p>Buckling under pressure from banks, the Reserve Bank of India put the revised guidelines for classification of bank advances for agricultural sector on hold. The revised norms would be applicable from the next accounting year ending March 31, 1998.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>TRUCKERS CALL OFF STRIKE</p>
<p>The nine-day-old truckers strike was called off following an agreement between the members of the All India Motors Transport Congress (AIMTC) and the government. Under the agreement, service tax would now be deducted at source itself, and would be collected by the consigner or the consignee themselves, instead of truck operators, as suggested in the budget. Regarding the new motor insurance premium it was decided that it would be kept in abeyance and the whole issue would be re-examined by the tariff advisory committee and representatives of AIMTC would be consulted on the new premium.</p>

<p>BOMBAY BOURSE INDEX SPURTS BY 130 POINTS</p>
<p>Pivotals turned bullish and the sensex zoomed by 130 points on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in a buying euphoria fuelled by fresh developments on the political front. The BSE sensitive index started higher at 3,541.71 and recovered further, sharply reflecting the upswing in the prices to close at 3,650.88, with a sizeable gain of 130.39 points compared to the previous level of 3,520.49.</p>

<p>Business Standard</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT TO IMPORT ADDITIONAL TWO MLN TONNES WHEAT</p>
<p>The government planned to import an additional two million tonnes of wheat to tide over the current tight domestic supply position. The cabinet secretary indicated the country had enough foreign exchange reserves to import more wheat, if needed. Although there was much speculation in international trade circles on more wheat imports by India, there was no official confirmation so far.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>FINANCE BILL REFERRED TO PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE</p>
<p>In a last ditch effort to save the 1997/98 Finance Bill, it was referred to the parliamentary standing committee on finance. The outcome of this was being eagerly awaited by industry, which had strongly lobbied for the passing of the Finance Bill through multiparty consensus. But the Bharatiya Janata Party is determined to oppose the passing of the bill and the standing committee meeting would be chaired by a senior lawmaker of the party in the absence of the committee chairman who is now in hospital. The committee's final decision would depend largely on political developments.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>STAY ON GOVERNMENT'S MOVE ON CELLULAR BANK GUARANTEES</p>
<p>The Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) stayed until May 15 proceedings by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) against cellular phone operators. The six companies had not paid the government licence fees for the second year. DoT was planning to encash the bank guarantees of these companies. TRAI took the decision while hearing a petition filed by Fascel, the Gujarat cellular licensee. The company wanted the effective date of the second year licence fee tranche to be extended, since DoT had delayed clearances for frequency allocation.</p>

<p>The Observer</p>
<p>$60 MLN SAVING ON CRUDE IMPORT</p>
<p>The government's oil bill is likely to come down following a drop in crude oil prices since January-end. Oil purchases have reportedly showed a saving of $60 million in the previous two months. Sources in Indian Oil Corporation said the monthly purchase of crude oil was around 2.5 million tonnes per month. A saving of $12 million per million tonne was estimated.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>SINGLE SHOT RBI CLEARANCE FOR NON RESIDENT INDIAN SHARES</p>
<p>Indian companies from now on would have to approach the central bank (RBI) only once, instead of twice, to seek permission for issue and export of shares to non-resident Indian (NRI) investors.</p>
