<headline>Powers defends Packer on ANI, casino.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-04-15</dateline>

<p>Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd has defended its role in the 1991 sale of its environmental waste unit ABT to Australian National Industries Ltd, CPH Managing Director Brian Powers said.</p>
<p>Powers said a report last week on Australian Broadcating Corp's (ABC) Four Corners about the ABT sale and the awarding of the Sydney Harbour Casino licence contained an &quot;extraordinary number of inaccuracies and misrepresentations&quot;. &quot;The report is highly defamatory and we will be suing the ABC and the individuals responsible,&quot; Powers said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Powers said Four Corner's suggestion that CPH made a lot of money out of its two-and-a-half year investment in ANI while ANI did not make money was not correct.</p>
<p>&quot;CPH is proud of its contribution to the obvious turnaround in ANI's fortunes at that time,&quot; Powers said, referring to the 50 percent rise in ANI's share price between CPH's purchase of a controlling stake in May 1989 and its sale in late 1991.</p>
<p>Powers said the ABT sale by CPH to ANI happened after CPH throughly examined ABT.</p>
<p>&quot;The business was contained and was not running totally out of a control, as Four Corners has suggested,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Powers said ANI management was keen to buy ABT as it fitted well with its Holter environmental engineering group in Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;Contrary to what Four Corners alleges, ANI's own assessment did not show that the prognosis was poor,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was believed by ANI that, following initial losses, allowed for in the price, ABT would be profitable,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The price for the acquisition of ABT was negotiated at arms length and no coercion was used by CPH.&quot;</p>
<p>Late last year ANI sold three parts of its Holter operation, including some of the ABT business, after writing down the value of its Holter assets by A$234 million in its 1995/96 results.  </p>
<p>Powers said the market for environmental engineering had become extremely competitive since 1993. This was the major factor in the downturn in Holter's performance, he said.</p>
<p>Powers also said allegations by Four Corners about the ABT deal not being disclosed to the stock exchange were wrong in fact and malicious.</p>
<p>He also said Four Corners' claims about the role of ANI's independent directors in the ABT acquisition were incorrect.</p>
<p>ANI appointed Queens Counsel Bob Ellicott, a former Australian attorney-general and federal judge, to investigate the ABT purchase late last year.  </p>
<p>Powers said Lousiana Police had been reported saying it did not believe the report was stolen and was released by mistake because of sloppy file-keeping.</p>
<p>-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800  </p>
<p>This followed pressure from former sharholder Ross Palmer.</p>
<p>Ellicott is due to release his report later this month.</p>
<p>Powers also defended the role of Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, which is 46 percent owned by CPH, in its application for the Sydney Harbour Casino licence.</p>
<p>He said any suggestion that CPH/PBL was involved in the use of a stolen Louisiana State Police report into the probity of PBL's competitor for the licence, Showboat Inc, was totally without foundation.</p>
