<p>Belgian airline Sabena SA, scrambling to recover from a disastrous 1996, said on Wednesday a drastic savings plan aimed at returning it to profitability was starting to pay off.</p>
<p>&quot;We're beginning to book the first results of the Horizon 1998 (savings) plan,&quot; Sabena spokesman Erik Sclep told Reuters. &quot;I think we're on the right track,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sabena, owned 49.5 percent by Swissair, had a 1995 group loss before provisions of 530 million Belgian francs ($15.6 million) and two billion franc ($58.8 million) net loss in the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>Chairman Valere Croes admitted last week that 1996 had been a bad year altogether, but the airline has declined to comment on media reports that the full-year loss was likely to be between four and six billion francs ($117.6 and 176.5 million).</p>
<p>&quot;It's correct that the losses will be bigger than estimated,&quot; Sabena's Swissair-appointed chief executive officer Paul Reutlinger told De Morgen newspaper in an interview of which excerpts were published on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sabena's structural problems were compounded early last year by a series of strikes which undermined passenger confidence and shaved its performance for key criteria, such as the seat occupancy rate.</p>
<p>Reutlinger said recently the carrier had six months to prove to Swissair that the negative trend was being reversed.</p>
<p>Sclep said passenger traffic in Europe was up 10 percent in January compared to the year-ago month and exceeded Sabena's own target by one percent.</p>
<p>Sabena also jumped to first place in the Association of European Airlines' (AEA) ranking of punctuality in December for the first time in its existence -- exceeding the Horizon plan goal which envisaged a top three ranking by 1998.</p>
<p>Sabena was still only Europe's fifth most punctual airline in November and 11th at the beginning of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;January also seems to be looking good (for punctuality),&quot; Sclep said.</p>
<p>Sclep quoted Reutlinger as telling a meeting of the Belgian aviation club earlier on Wednesday he rated punctuality high as it proved that all divisions were cooperating well.</p>
<p>Sabena's seat occupancy rate was exceeding company targets for transcontinental flights and flights to Africa, he said.</p>
<p>The seat occupancy rate for Europe was in line with expectations but the link with Tokyo was still below par.</p>
<p>Sales on the Belgian market rose 19 percent in December, compared with the rest of the market which rose just six percent on average.</p>
