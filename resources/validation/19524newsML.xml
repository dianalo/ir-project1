<p>Republican vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp campaigned aggressively for the black vote on Wednesday in an area that was the flashpoint of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.</p>
<p>Kemp told a crowd of about 300 African Americans in the gymnasium of the Challengers Boys and Girls Club in south central Los Angeles: &quot;Keep your eyes open, keep your ears open, keep your heart open. I want to tell you with all my heart that we want to win your vote.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he and Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole would strive to create a new civil rights agenda for America, &quot;with all the fiber in our beings.&quot;</p>
<p>Kemp, a former U.S. Housing Secretary who championed the cause of those living in blighted inner cities, recently reversed himself on affirmative action policies favouring women and minorities, saying he now backed their repeal.</p>
<p>But he said on Wednesday he and Dole favoured a new kind of affirmative action that would give empowerment, business ownership, entrepreneurial opportunities, scholarships and jobs to minorities. He said the new affirmative action would be part of the Republicans' &quot;civil rights agenda.&quot;</p>
<p>Referring to Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president who was responsible for ending slavery in America, Kemp said, &quot;Our party of Mr Lincoln will not be whole again until blacks and African Americans come home to this party.&quot;</p>
<p>He reminded the crowd that as Housing Secretary he came to south Central Los Angeles with President George Bush after the 1992 riots to see what could be done to help the area recover.</p>
<p>The riots, sparked by the acquittal of four white police officers in the 1991 videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King, left more than 50 people dead and caused at least $1 billion in damage.</p>
<p>Kemp appealed on Wednesday for a reconciliation of racial differences, saying, &quot;There is only one race, the human race. We are all brothers and sisters. There is only one answer on the eve of the 21st century and it is racial reconciliation.&quot;</p>
<p>Kemp, who was frequently applauded during his speech, was told by community and religious leaders that the main problems in the area were crime, particularly drugs and automatic weapons, and a lack of jobs.</p>
