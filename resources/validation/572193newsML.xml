<p>A rainstorm that battered southern China killed at least 40 people after triggering devastating floods that one local official on Friday described as occuring only once in five centuries.</p>
<p>The storm, which hit the southern province of Guangdong on Wednesday and Thursday, caused rivers to burst their banks, submerging fields and affecting 30,000 people, a provincial official said.</p>
<p>At least 40 people were killed in outlying areas of the provincial capital Guangzhou, he said.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Shenzhen, at least 35 people were killed and 35 injured on Thursday night when a China Southern Airlines Boeing 737-300 slammed into the airport tarmac while attempting to land in a thunderstorm, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;This kind of flood happens once only every 500 years,&quot; the provincial official said by telephone. &quot;The 40 deaths were mainly because of houses collapsing.&quot;</p>
<p>Guangzhou authorities declared an emergency and were bracing for similar storms over the next few days, he said, but gave no further details.</p>
<p>Devastating floods, many triggered by storms and typhoons in southern China, killed more than 2,000 people in 1996, affecting some 300 million and causing damages worth more than 200 billion yuan ($24.1 billion). ($1 = 8.3 yuan)</p>
