<p>Sri Lanka's stock market has emerged from its recent bear phase and the benchmark share index should gain at least another 3.7 percent by the end of the year, a report by the Bank of Ceylon said.</p>
<p>The report, received by Reuters on Wednesday, said daily turnover in foreign and local shares on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) had risen by between 20 and 60 percent year-on-year in the January to May period.</p>
<p>The CSE All Share Index stood just below 820 points at noon on July 16, after starting the year at 607. The index peaked at 1,378 in March 1994.</p>
<p>The market fell sharply in 1996 when corporate earnigns were hit by power cuts due to a severe drought.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock market performance will improve further during the year,&quot; the bank report said. &quot;The CSE index will pass the 850 mark by the year-end.&quot;</p>
