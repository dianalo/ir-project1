<p>Business in over-the-counter gold options was brisk and volatilities soared to levels not seen for nearly a year as the underlying price plummeted, dealers said.</p>
<p>One month implied volatilities zoomed up to as high as 11.5 percent this week as bullion prices dropped to fresh 3-1/4 year lows, they said. January had eased slightly on Thursday morning to around 10.0/11.0 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It obviously warrants these volatilities in the short term. It's vicious. And some of the buying has filtered into the longer term as well,&quot; an options dealer said.</p>
<p>A week ago high bids were at around 10 percent, versus 6.1 percent at the end of last year, following a steep decline in the underlying price so far this year.</p>
<p>Since Tuesday the gold price has been subject to dramatic gyrations, swinging from highs around $360 to a low of $351.40 amid an overall downtrend.</p>
<p>&quot;The vols are not as high as when gold got up to $415 (in February 1996), when one-month got up to 15 percent. So there's room for them to go higher,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>A concentration of open interest was seen at or around $350 an ounce, the psychologically significant support level for spot gold, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a long-term support line at around $350-$351. People seem to have bought in advance of that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But interest in the $345 area, seen by some analysts as the next downside target, and even lower was also cropping up.</p>
<p>&quot;Today for the first time I sold a $330 strike. The $340s have been in play a few times but otherwise they have been concentrated between $350 and $370,&quot; a dealer in continental Europe said.</p>
<p>Both puts and calls were in demand, and the market was mixed as to the short term future of the gold price, dealers said.</p>
<p>However, puts appeared to be taking precedence, reflecting an overall bearish tone.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is a bit crazy now, there is a lot of volatility. People are afraid of the downside basically,&quot; one European dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The puts have been coming in on the short end, and on the long end, the one-year stuff, there's been some producer selling of calls around $370 and $380,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The professional market is not as busy as I would have expected. It's more lively, but not in big amounts, in 10-20,000 ounces,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Longer term volatilities were slightly firmer.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, three month implied volatilities were bid at 9.0 percent, six months at 8.0 to 8.75 percent and 12-month at 7.7 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;When the market is excited like this it starts in the short term. For now the one year volatility is up just a bit,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
