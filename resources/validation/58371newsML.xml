<p>Shares in casualwear maker and retailer Glorious Sun Enterprise Ltd ended their trading debut on Tuesday at HK$2.40 each, up HK$0.80 or 50 percent from their issue price of HK$1.60.</p>
<p>The shares, the second-most actively traded stock in turnover, moved in a range of HK$2.20 to HK$2.475. Volume was 190.78 million shares worth HK$445.64 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The surge was expected in view of its strong subscription results and warm market response,&quot; said Rebecca Ng, analyst at Tai Fook Securities.</p>
<p>Glorious Sun offered a total 250 million new shares, comprising a retail offer of 100 million and a placement of 150 million, at HK$1.60 per share.</p>
<p>Its retail portion was 236 times subscribed.</p>
<p>&quot;It was even better than our expectation of topping out at HK$2.25 to HHK$2.30,&quot; said Sean Li, associate director from Amsteel Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Its concept of tapping the improving China retail market, especially on anticipation of growing consumer spending after China cut interest rates, is well accepted by investors,&quot; said Patrick Chia, research manager from China Everbright Securities.  </p>
<p>Analysts said short term retail investors were seen taking profits above HK$2.40, while institutions were expected to be less aggressive in unloading their shares.</p>
<p>&quot;The lack of large sell orders indicates institutions may be holding the shares for longer term investment, and that gives support to the share price longer term,&quot; one analsyt said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the stock was fully valued between HK$2.40 to HK$2.60 based on forecast earnings ratio of 12 to 14 times for full year 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;We recommend a buy in the medium to long term because of Glorious Sun's strong fundamentals, and the shares still have room on the upside in the longer run,&quot; Ng said.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expected the shares to consolidate in the short run with a limited downside risk if institutions continued to hold onto their stakes.</p>
<p>Glorious Sun said it would use the proceeds of its share offer to develop and expand its Jeanswest retail network in China, Australia and New Zealand to 510 shops by April 1998, from the current 349 shops, and over 1,000 outlets after 2000.</p>
<p>The company also makes jeans for retailers including The GAP, JC Penney, Phillip Van Heusen, Structure and Haggar.</p>
