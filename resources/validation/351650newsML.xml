<p>Bangladesh's Finance Minister S.A.M.S. Kibria on Monday claimed &quot;remarkable&quot; success in economic management, especially in containing inflation now at 2.71 percent, down from 5.81 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I am quite satisfied at this rate. Keeping inflation within control is the key to economic stability. Inflation destroys everything,&quot; Kibria told a news conference.</p>
<p>The finance minister defended his tight credit policy, saying that he did not want inflation slipping out of control.</p>
<p>&quot;It must be contained within five percent,&quot; he said, disclosing to the media the performance of key sectors of the economy since the Awami League government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina won power in elections in June.</p>
<p>Kibria said credit expansion between July and November last year had been brought down to taka 15.3 billion from 34.5 billion taka during the corresponding months of the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;Unbridled credit expansion in the past gave rise to non-performing loans and fuelled inflation. We want credit to be utilised,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The minister expressed concern at the huge accumulation of non-performing loans, estimated at around taka 150 billion. This is more than 40 percent of the total advances by the country's banks and financial institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;The new government has put all its strength to recover huge overdue loans accumulated over the years ... this non-payment (of loans) culture has burdened the whole banking system,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lutfar Rahman Sarkar, governor of the Bangladesh Bank (central bank), told reporters on Monday he had ordered banks to recover at least 50 percent of their overdue loans by March 31.</p>
<p>&quot;We are monitoring the recovery every day. Money is flowing back&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>Kibria said the country's import trade was undergoing a qualitative change, with the import of food and consumer goods declining and that of capital machinery rising.</p>
<p>However, he expressed concern at the &quot;slow growth&quot; of exports during July-December, 1996, estimated at $2.18 billion, a rise of only seven percent over the same period of 1995.</p>
