<title>CANADA: Abitibi-Price hit by lower sales volumes.</title>
<headline>Abitibi-Price hit by lower sales volumes.</headline>

<p>Abitibi-Price Inc said on Monday its nine-month results were hurt by falling sales volumes, but that that its efficiency improved considerably.</p>
<p>Abitibi said that before second-quarter restructuring charges totaling C$28 million, its earnings for the first nine months of 1996 were C$131 million or C$1.44 a fully diluted share.</p>
<p>&quot;This is C$51 million lower than the first nine months of 1995, largely the result of lower sales volumes -- 142,000 tonnes or 11 percent lower for newsprint and 74,000 tonnes or 15 percent for value-added papers,&quot; Abitibi said.  </p>
<p>Abitibi posted third-quarter net profit of C$18 million or C$0.20 a share. That compared with earnings of C$84 million or C$0.91 a share in the prior-year period. In the second quarter of this year, the paper producer earned C$23 million or C$0.26 a share.</p>
<p>&quot;Our operating profit in the third quarter was 33 percent better than the last time we faced similar prices in a downturn,&quot; chief executive Ron Oberlander said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;That was in 1989 and our efficiency and productivity now rival the best in the industry,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>In the third quarter of 1996, Abitibi took a charge due to flooding at its Kenogami mill in Quebec. The cost of business interruption and repairs was covered under insurance but the deductible and cleaning and repair costs not covered cost C$4 million.</p>
<p>In the 1995 period, Abitibi recorded a C$4 million unusual gain from the disposition of assets at a former mill site in Thunder Bay, Ontario.</p>
<p>Oberlander said the company's efficiency for the first nine months of this year was above 88 percent for its newsprint operations, versus 1989 levels of 81 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;This improvement has helped us become much more able to weather pricing downturns such as the one we're going through this year,&quot; Oberlander said.</p>
<p>Revenue fell to C$613 million in the third quarter from C$757 million in the year ago quarter. Sales dropped to C$1.97 billion in the first nine months of 1996 from year earlier C$2.04 billion.</p>
<p>Nine-month results for 1996 included pre-tax second quarter charges of C$28 million for the conversion to two new thermo-mechanical pulping plants. Before the charges, earnings for the first nine months of 1996 were C$131 million.</p>
