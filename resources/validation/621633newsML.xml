<title>SWEDEN: Swedish bond yields rise on radio EMU report.</title>
<headline>Swedish bond yields rise on radio EMU report.</headline>

<p>Swedish debt yields were higher at midday on Wednesday, pushed upwards by a radio report saying the Prime and Finance Ministers had agreed Sweden could not join EMU during the next mandate period 1998-2002 without new parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>The radio said this meant that either new parliamentary elections must be held or Sweden would have to wait until 2003 to join EMU after scheduled parliamentary elections in 2002.</p>
<p>&quot;The instant reaction was negative but it soon ebbed out,&quot; a chief dealer said. &quot;If people were serioulsy worried it wouldn't look like this.&quot;  </p>
<p>The six-month T-bill rates rose three basis point to 4.29 percent and the ten-year bond yields advanced five basis points to 7.11 percent. The crown softed to 4.5045 against the mark from 4.4920 late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Some market players said the radio report could be correct, but said a significant impact on the market was unlikely.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very strong market, so I don't think there will be any major reaction,&quot; a chief dealer said. &quot;A Swedish EMU entry by 2002 has been discounted...I think people will look at the fundamentals and then forget about this. It could even be good to wait with joining EMU given the French election,&quot; he said.</p>
