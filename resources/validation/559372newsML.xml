<p>Kazakhstan's embattled prime minister has said in a rare interview that his former Soviet republic has still to pull itself through the most painful stage of market reform.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we will pass through the most painful step in 1997 and the first half of 1998,&quot; Kazakh Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin told the weekly Karavan newspaper published at the weekend.</p>
<p>Patience with reform is at a low ebb among the 16.9 million population, tired of having to go for months without their wages and pensions. Many Soviet-era factories are at a standstill.</p>
<p>Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, alarmed at the dent the payments crisis has made on his flagging popularity, sought in Kazhegeldin a lightning rod for the discontent, threatening in March to sack him unless he found a way to pay off debts.</p>
<p>Kazhegeldin, 45 and a former businessman, said he had been prepared to resign if Nazarbayev disagreed with his reform programme. &quot;I used this as a means of giving the president a choice,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the president had second thoughts last month, giving Kazhegeldin until the end of the year to pay off state debts to pensioners.</p>
<p>The prime minister was also sanguine in the face of the government's widespread unpopularity.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand perfectly that popularity won't come to us,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;I am not ashamed of what I have done in the last three years.&quot;</p>
<p>Investors in the republic, a mountainous area the size of western Europe boasting huge reserves of oil and gas, breathed a collective sigh of relief over Kazhegeldin's survival. They see him as the guarantor of reform.</p>
<p>Kazhegeldin has won admiration for slashing inflation to around 30 percent in 1996 -- inflation is targetted at 15-17 percent this year -- and for pushing forward an ambitious sale of state assets.</p>
<p>&quot;Kazhegeldin was weak, he had a lot of problems earlier this year, but he's dealt with these and come out on top,&quot; said a Western diplomat based in the Kazakh capital Almaty. &quot;He's got plenty of enemies but he's in better shape,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pyotr Svoik, head of the opposition grouping Azamat, or &quot;Citizen&quot;, and a relentless critic of Kazhegeldin, said: &quot;He remains a powerful figure.&quot;</p>
<p>Neither do investors appear to worry much over Kazhegeldin's defeat at the hands of the country's powerful &quot;oil barons&quot;, who dug in their heels over his fast-paced privatisation of the oil and gas industry. He lost control of the sector in a government shake-up in March.</p>
<p>&quot;The feeling in the market is that he (Kazhegeldin) is in control,&quot; said an Almaty-based market analyst. &quot;The loss of the oil is a minor setback,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However Nazarbayev, worried about what he has called a potentially &quot;dangerous divide between rich and poor&quot;, is keeping a close eye on Kazhelgeldin, whose political fortunes are now tied closely to his ability to deliver on the payments crisis.</p>
