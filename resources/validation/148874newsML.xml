<title>HONG KONG: Guangshen Railway to cut domestic fares.</title>

<dateline>HONG KONG 1996-10-28</dateline>

<p>Guangshen Railway Co Ltd said it will lower fares on high-speed trains running Guangzhou-to-Shenzhen to the level before price were raised in Ocotber 1995 to enhance the railway's competitiveness.</p>
<p>But no fare changes were planned for the lucrative Guangzhou-to-Hong Kong through train, the company added.</p>
<p>From November 1, first class high-speed train fares will be cut by 22.22 percent to 70 yuan from 90 yuan and second-class fares by 18.75 percent to 65 yuan from 80 yuan, Guangshen said in a statement on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;After careful analysis of the market, Guangshen has decided to make domestic high speed fare reductions that are slightly larger than the company anticipated earlier this year,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The company estimated about a 10 percent fare cut earlier.</p>
<p>It said it believed the cuts and its increased number of high speed trains would lift ridership and raise Guangshen's competitiveness against other means of transportation.</p>
<p>The Chinese railway operator experienced a decline on passenger and freights volumes earlier this year due to a ticket price rise and competition from buses.</p>
<p>The company said it hoped the fares cut could help reverse the decline of passenger volume.</p>
<p>&quot;Guangshen's high speed project is a critical part of the company strategy,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Guangshen also said on November 1, it would reach the target of 19 round-trip high speed passenger trains operating daily between Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and Guangzhou and Hong Kong's Kowloon.</p>
<p>It has increased the frequency of its trains to 47 pairs per day from 36 per day since the beginning of 1996, the railway operator said.</p>
