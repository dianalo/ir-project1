<p>Belgium awoke on Thursday to the horror of another child murder -- that of a nine-year-old girl missing since August 1992.</p>
<p>The remains of Loubna Benaissa were found late on Wednesday in a crate of car parts in the cellar of a garage just metres (yards) from her home in central Brussels.</p>
<p>The cause of death was not immediately known, but a convicted sex offender whose family owned the garage was placed under arrest along with three other men.</p>
<p>Patrick Derochette, 33, who received a suspended sentence in 1984 for child molesting, was being questioned on Thursday by a special police unit set up last summer following the discovery of children murdered by another paedophile gang.</p>
<p>No links have yet been established between the two groups.</p>
<p>&quot;Although we do not yet have final scientific evidence, we are very certain we have found the body of Loubna Benaissa,&quot; Michel Bourlet, the unit's chief investigator, told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no words to describe the horror which inspires such (cowardly) acts,&quot; Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said in a statement, summing up the nation's feelings.</p>
<p>&quot;This news brings to an end the painful uncertainty for (Benaissa's) family, which has become a symbol of courage and tenacity for many of our citizens,&quot; Dehaene added.</p>
<p>Wednesday's discovery of the putrefied body in the inner suburb of Ixelles reopened Belgium's grim dossier of child abuse and murder.</p>
<p>The investigation into Benaissa's disappearance was marked by allegations of bungling by authorities, accused of not taking the case seriously, failing to appoint an investigating judge and closing the file on her after just two years.</p>
<p>Derochette was first questioned by police just days after the girl went missing while on her way to a supermarket, but was released without charge, Belgian media reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The case was only reopened last August after the discovery of the bodies of four girls murdered by a gang led by convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux.</p>
<p>Dutroux was arrested following the rescue from a makeshift dungeon in one of his houses of Sabine Dardenne and Laetitia Delhez -- both of whom had been sexually abused.</p>
<p>Two days later Dutroux led police to the bodies of eight-year-old Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo, buried in the garden of one of his six houses in and around the central Belgian city of Charleroi. The girls had starved to death.</p>
<p>Barely two weeks later Dutroux led police to another house where they unearthed the bodies of teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks.</p>
<p>The parents of the dead girls launched a campaign complaining about police and judicial bungling in the searches for their daughters. They were joined by the parents of other missing children.</p>
<p>In October more than 250,000 people took to the streets of Brussels in what came to be known as the White March -- the biggest peacetime demonstration of its kind in the country.</p>
<p>The so-called White Committee urged Belgians on Thursday to wear white and hang white sheets or balloons from their windows as a sign of respect for Loubna.</p>
