<title>UK: Shareholders &quot;not urging BT-MCI merger be dropped&quot;.</title>
<headline>Shareholders &quot;not urging BT-MCI merger be dropped&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>British Telecommunications Plc said on Sunday it did not believe any institutional shareholders were calling for it to abandon a $20 billion dollar takeover of troubled U.S. firm MCI Communications Corp.</p>
<p>However, ahead of the completion of a review of MCI's businesses expected towards the end of this month, a BT spokesman conceded that institutions were universally concerned about the price it was paying.</p>
<p>&quot;Institutions are broadly positive about the strategy of getting into U.S. markets with MCI but they do feel the price we agreed in November is too high,&quot; a BT spokesman said.</p>
<p>The Observer newspaper reported major institutional shareholders such as the Prudential insurance group and PDFM were calling on BT to abandon the merger after MCI's surprise profits warning last month.</p>
<p>Analysts said that if the report were true, the Prudential and PDFM were taking a &quot;brave stance&quot; and BT could face a shareholder revolt.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this could spur other investors to follow suit and oppose the deal&quot;, said Oliver Ehrenberg, telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming.</p>
<p>Critics of the merger say BT is paying up to 80 percent too much for a company which is facing more than $1.2 billion dollars in unforeseen losses in its expanding local businesses and increasing competition in its core long-distance operation.</p>
<p>But other analysts point to BT's plan to form a global telecoms giant called Concert Plc, which it hopes will secure its long-term future in the face of falling telephone call prices and margins.</p>
<p>Without MCI, this plan is likely to fall apart, they say.</p>
<p>While BT executives sift through MCI's books to work out the full extent of the damage and the best course of action, most analysts believe the merger will go ahead, although possibly with a 10-20 percent cosmetic reduction in price.</p>
<p>Analysts say their clients complain about a lack of information since MCI's profits warnings.</p>
<p>BT admits it has received letters from investors but the BT spokesman said their content was confidential.</p>
