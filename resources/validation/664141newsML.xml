<p>The mark suffered on its European crosses after EU nations agreed on a pact on fiscal discipline, heightening perceptions that European leaders were determined to push forward with monetary union.</p>
<p>The blow to the mark was light though as traders had been expecting European finance ministers to cobble together an agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;The history of monetary union shows that they always manage to bring something out of the bag at the last minute,&quot; said Rob Hayward, economic advisor at Bank of America here.  </p>
<p>Also, the mark did not suffer much because although Monday's deal meant Europe had overcome another glitch in monetary union, the market realised it was far from being the last hurdle.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly there is some feeling that the fundamental directions of the French and German policies are somewhat different. So it's positive that EMU remains on track, but there is still some doubt as to where it's heading,&quot; said Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International.</p>
<p>The latest dispute over EMU erupted last week when France's new government said it needed time to consider the stability pact, designed to enforce budget discipline on EMU members.  </p>
<p>France said more weight should be given to EU coordination to promote jobs and growth. Germany, meanwhile, has opposed a French proposal for a costly European drive to promote employment.</p>
<p>A special meeting of EU finance ministers, hastily arranged to discuss the issue on Sunday ahead of the two-day summit of EU leaders which began in Amsterdam today, resulted in a compromise deal. The details of the agreement have not yet been disclosed.</p>
<p>The mark fell to its session lows on news that an agreement had been reached, and was quoted at 3.3725/30 French francs at 1440 GMT against 3.3738/43 in late European trade on Friday.  </p>
<p>Against the lira, another EMU-sensitive currency, the mark dropped to a low of 980.15 against Friday's 981.95/25, although it recovered to around 981 soon after.</p>
<p>Damage to the mark was limited also because Germany had insisted on fiscal discipline and refused to commit itself to extra spending to promote jobs in the process of striking a deal on the stability pact, analysts said.</p>
<p>This augured well for the euro and should benefit all EMU-bloc currencies including the mark, they said, adding that these are likely to gain against the U.S. dollar which had risen amid the problems over EMU.  </p>
<p>&quot;The biggest risk to the market would have been if the French government had pushed very aggressively for some pan-European job creation and if that wish had been granted,&quot; said Ken Wattret, economist at Banque Paribas.</p>
<p>&quot;Then there would have been question marks about loose fiscal policy and potential budget problems, which would have undermined the euro bloc against the dollar,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some said the market was not very disturbed by the issue of the stability pact because although it was a substantial stumbling block, it was not as serious as some of the other issues hanging over EMU.  </p>
<p>&quot;The future of the German coalition and the German budget is more important in the whole EMU process than French objections to the stability pact,&quot; said Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Investment Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Germany's ability to deliver a convincing budget for 1997 and 1998... So far they've really struggled to come up with a deal that would get them to the target (of a three-percent budget deficit to GDP ratio), and that looks more potentially serious,&quot; he said.</p>
