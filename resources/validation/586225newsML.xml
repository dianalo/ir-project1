<p>In or out of power, Winston Peters, New Zealand's Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, has proved no stranger to scandal.</p>
<p>His defiant display on Thursday, as he refused to be drawn into apologising to parliament for his part in a late-night fracas with another MP, was also a reminder of his tough fibre.</p>
<p>Opposition leaders, including senior figures from the large Labour Party and the left-wing Alliance grouping, tried but failed to embarrass Peters in a heated debate over the incident.</p>
<p>As a man who cut his political teeth on making allegations of misdeeds and corruption, the New Zealand First party leader showed he is adept at turning the heat off himself.</p>
<p>He ended up pouring scorn on his opponents and threatening to sue one of them, Deputy Labour Party Leader Michael Cullen.</p>
<p>The trained lawyer reinforced his public image as a physically imposing figure, gripping the despatch box during his speech and booming out his words in a characteristic deep voice.</p>
<p>&quot;You can come here and make all the trivial, petty comments you like, but this is a matter of justice,&quot; Peters told Alliance leader Jim Anderton, who originally complained to parliament's privileges committee after the alleged assault on March 5.</p>
<p>The committee found Peters had not been in contempt of parliamentary rules but believed an assault had occurred and suggested he apologise to the house for what it called unbecoming conduct.</p>
<p>The contempt charge was made by Anderton after a confrontation between Peters and outspoken National Party backbencher John Banks.</p>
<p>Banks and Anderton said in evidence that Peters had assaulted and threatened Banks outside the debating chamber after a late-night parliamentary debate.</p>
<p>&quot;If you think I am going to kow in front of this house while you make false statements, then you are so wrong... so wrong,&quot; Peters said, in comments directed at Anderton.</p>
<p>Anderton made little headway in trying to respond and the debate peaked with Peters' display, finally backfiring on the opposition party leader when the 120-member house resoundingly voted down his proposal to further discipline Peters.</p>
<p>Well known for his dark good looks and stylish double-breasted suits, Peters is a charismatic, populist leader who learned his trade from the fiery Sir Robert Muldoon, prime minister from 1975 to 1984.</p>
<p>The maverick half-Maori half-Scottish MP first showed his true political hand on the 1996 election campaign trail when, with accusation after accusation, he barely concealed his hatred for the party that once spurned him -- National.</p>
<p>New Zealand First -- opponents dub it &quot;Winston First&quot; -- fought the election on promises to put ordinary people's welfare above the interests of foreigners and big business.</p>
<p>Yet, by patching up the differences between National and his breakaway party, Peters quickly put the shoe on the other foot and struck a deal that got him into government.</p>
<p>Having held on for two months of coalition negotiations, Peters went on live television to reveal his party's choice in a masterful piece of political theatre.</p>
<p>Peters secured the prizes of Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, but surprised many of his own supporters as he opted to bury the hatchet with Prime Minister Jim Bolger -- his former nemesis and the man who sacked him as Maori Affairs minister in 1991.</p>
<p>The political relationship with National has not proved entirely harmonious, and NZ First has been criticised from within its support base which includes large numbers of Maori traditionally hostile to National.</p>
<p>Other scandals involving NZ First party members have also undermined the credibility of the minor coalition party, being reflected in a slump in popularity polls for both partners.</p>
<p>Bolger's absence from the parliamentary chamber during Thursday's debates was taken by some commentators as a signal of his continuing unease with his flamboyant deputy.</p>
