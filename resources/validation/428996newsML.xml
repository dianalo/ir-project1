<p>Brian Lara and Mickey Mouse could vie for attention at Disneyland, Florida, from next year.</p>
<p>Anxious to expand cricket beyond the Commonwealth and break into the lucrative U.S. market, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has held discussions with Walt Disney World Company with a view to staging at least three one-day international tournaments in Orlando, Florida.</p>
<p>West Indies and their world record holder Brian Lara would be obvious choices to demonstrate the attractions of one-day cricket to a north American audience.</p>
<p>&quot;The ICC Development Committee has received a proposal by Walt Disney World Co that the committee believes will promote the development of cricket in an important new market,&quot; says an interim report of the ICC development committee released to Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The proposal is that test playing ocuntries sent their national teams to play at Walt Disney's Wide World of Sports Facility in Orlando, Florida.</p>
<p>&quot;A commitment is required from the ICC and the full members that a minimum of three national teams will participate in an international one-day series for a minimum of three consecutive years, the tournament to take place in August-September in 1998, 1999 and 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;When this commitment is made Walt Disney World will construct a cricket facility to international standards.</p>
<p>&quot;The Walt Disney World Company plan to make the sports facility in Orlando a premier international sports destination. Cricket must take advantage of this opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>The comittee was formed in response to a report from ICC chief executive David Richards, who argued last year that the sport was too narrowly based to compete with other sports.</p>
<p>In its reponse the development committee said other popular sporting codes were now played during the regular cricket season among its member nations.</p>
<p>&quot;Cricket has to compete with other sports and leisure activities for media, sponsorship and participant support,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;Further growth can be achieved by expanding demand for cricket in North America, Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;Internationally televised cricket is our number one marketing tool to give global exposure to the game, to inspire the youth to play the game and to promote the role models of the game.&quot;</p>
<p>The committee also argued that the present World Cup one-day competition staged once every four years should be a biennial tournament.</p>
<p>&quot;More frequent World Cups would encourage business to invest in cricket, while schools would be more likely to include cricket in their curriculum,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Indications are that TV rights fees will continue to increase. Staging the World Cup every two years would result in substantial financial benefits to the host country, the global expansion of the game and development among associate members.&quot;</p>
