<p>Taiwan's Lite-On Technology lit up an otherwise lacklustre Asian debt market on Friday with a floating rate note issue.</p>
<p>Lite-on Technology Corp unit LTC HK launched a US$45 million FRN through arrangers Citicorp International and HSBC Markets.</p>
<p>The five-year notes can be put in year three and be called in years three and four. They pay a margin of 70 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and, with fees, an all-in return of 76.6 basis points to top-tier managers.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Lite-on said it would use the proceeds from the issue to finance the construction of its new plants in Scotland and Mexico and to repay foreign currency loans.</p>
<p>In July, the company said it planned to invest US$78 million in Scotland to make monitors. Lite-on is one of Taiwan's leading computer monitor manufacturers.</p>
<p>Lite-on raised US$71.3 million in September through an issue of global depository receipts.</p>
<p>On Monday, Chase Manhattan Asia will formally launch a US$75 million floating rate certificate of deposit issue for Philippine Commercial International Bank.</p>
<p>The three-year paper pays a coupon of 75 basis points over LIBOR and an all-in return of 85 basis points to top-tier managers. There is a fixed-reoffer price of 99.80 that will hold until the November 11 reply deadline.</p>
<p>In line with the trend for Philippines issues, pricing is tighter than that of PCI Bank's other issues launched this year.</p>
<p>In June, PCI Bank set a three-year FRCD that paid 90 basis points to the top tier. Last month, the bank launched a five-year Eurobond that was priced to yield 120 basis points over comparable U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>South Korea's Hanil Bank reportedly is planning to launch a three-year floating rate note issue that will pay 26 basis points all-in to the top tier.</p>
<p>Cho Hung Bank in early October launched a five year non-call three step-up FRN that paid 26 basis points to the call. At the time, dealers said the pricing was tight.</p>
<p>Since then, however, South Korea has been formally asked to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an invitation that bankers said could worth a few, but probably not many, basis points to Korean bank issuers.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will tender its debut 10-year Exchange Fund Note in a bid to lengthen the government debt yield curve.</p>
