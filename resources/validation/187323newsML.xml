<p> TIFFE Euroyen 3M (M)     99.22		   99.15</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Key June three-month Euroyen futures ended higher on Wednesday due to a fall in interest rate swap (IRS) rates, particularly near the three-year zone, traders said.</p>
<p>The three-year IRS rate was quoted at 1.27/1.31 percent as of 0717 GMT, down sharply from around 1.46 percent in early afternoon trade on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>A trader at a long-term credit bank said city banks and foreign banks had received three-year fixed interest rates late on Tuesday, which triggered the steep fall in the IRS rate.</p>
<p>A city bank trader said those who received floating interest rates, who were on the other side of these trades, bought Euroyen futures for hedging purposes.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody wants to receive floating interest rates except for arbitrageurs, who are buying Euroyen futures to hedge their positions. Such buying is encouraging day traders to buy as well, creating a demand-driven market,&quot; the trader said.  </p>
<p>Trading volume of the June Euroyen futures was 80,677 contracts.</p>
<p>Traders said the weighted average of the key overnight call rate was likely to be 0.49 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders said there was upward pressure on the overnight call rate as fund demand remained strong ahead of the end of the current bank reserves reporting period on Friday.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan injected a net 600 billion yen into the money market this morning, maintaining its neutral stance.</p>
<p>The BOJ is likely to maintain its neutral stance for the time being, a trader for another city bank said.  </p>
<p>About 30 billion yen worth of the key three-month certificates of deposit (CDs) were issued on Wednesday, at 0.52 percent.</p>
<p>One- and two-month CDs were tagged with sell quotes of 0.49 percent and 0.50 percent, respectively. -- Tokyo Treasury Desk +81-3-5473-3748</p>
