<p>The long-awaited turnaround in Germany's job market was still nowhere to be seen on Thursday with May numbers due to disappoint and Finance Minister Theo Waigel admitting that the economy was no great help.</p>
<p>The continuing jobs slump comes as Germany courts increasing unpopularity in Europe with its continued opposition to a European Union employment chapter, a stance that could yet lead to political risks for Chancellor Helmut Kohl at home.</p>
<p>Official sources confirmed to Reuters before Friday's formal publication of new data that pan-German unadjusted unemployment in May fell by just 91,000 to 4.256 million month-on-month.</p>
<p>Such a decline is substantially less than many economists were expecting in a month where strong economic activity traditionally boosts the jobs market. It may yet equate to a rise in unemployment on a seasonally-adjusted basis.</p>
<p>The Federal Labour Office, the body that gathers and publishes the data, was not immediately to confirm the figures.</p>
<p>But its president, Bernhard Jagoda, told a meeting of regional labour office representatives in Dresden the high jobless levels would mean billions of marks more unemployment benefit costs than previously expected this year.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel, asked earlier to comment on new data showing German economic growth lodged at just 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter, was equally downbeat in his assessment of the overall picture.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest indicators are more positive, but unfortunately they are not yet impacting the labour market,&quot; he told journalists in Hamburg, where he was giving a speech.</p>
<p>If that is the case, Bonn's resistance to Europe-wide job creation measures due to be discussed at the Amsterdam EU summit on June 16 could yet emerge as politically untenable.</p>
<p>Speaking on the main evening news programme of Germany's ARD public television station, EU Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies said recent left-wing poll victories in London and Paris were making Germany, which argues employment policy is best handled nationally, appear more and more isolated.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got the wind in our sails now. Not only will we get an employment chapter in Amsterdam worth the name but leaders will also pass through some 80 employment pacts that we want to finance with the structural fund,&quot; said Wulf-Mathies, who is a member of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD).</p>
<p>Wulf-Mathies added she was &quot;fairly certain&quot; Bonn would lift its opposition to such measures and that it would see they did not contradict the tenets of the social market economy, the system that has served Germany since World War Two.</p>
<p>Germany's refusal to budge on the issue during a meeting of foreign ministers in Luxembourg this week gave the opposition SPD welcome material with which to attack the government on what is the top domestic political issue.</p>
<p>Trade unions too are outraged by Bonn's stance, with the German Trade Union Federation on Wednesday denouncing Foreign Ministry State Secretary Werner Hoyer's position in Luxembourg as a cyncial blocking tactic ahead of Amsterdam.</p>
