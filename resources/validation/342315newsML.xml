<p>Britain could still be in the first group of countries to join a single European currency, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said.</p>
<p>&quot;The cabinet has not ruled out joining in the first wave,&quot; Clarke told an interview with Wednesday's Financial Times newspaper, downplaying recent speculation that there had been a change of government policy toward the single currency.</p>
<p>Clarke reiterated the UK government's view that it is unlikely European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will start on time. But he said, &quot;The chances are it (EMU) will start in the next parliament.&quot;</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major is scheduled to call a general election by May.</p>
<p>&quot;There can't be anyone who thinks I'm going to fight a Euro-sceptic election campaign,&quot; said Clarke, who is widely seen a pro-European within the cabinet.</p>
<p>On the domestic front, Clarke said there was evidence the economy was strengthening but there was no sign of an 1980s- style boom.</p>
<p>&quot;I think everything shows a strengthening recovery, not out of hand, not showing symptoms of a boom and not building up inflationary pressures,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Clarke, who recently cited the strength of the pound as a key reason for keeping interest rates on hold, said he was under no pressure to raise rates again before the election.</p>
<p>The Chancellor pointed out that when the UK was in the European exchange rate mechanism just five years ago, the pound was the &quot;be-all-and-end-all&quot; of the fight against inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;It must be nonsense to assert that such a dramatic strengthening of the exchange rate has no anti-inflation effect,&quot; Clarke said.</p>
<p>Sterling has risen up to 6.6 percent against a trade- weighted basket of currencies since October, gaining as much as 14.4 percent against the German mark during that period.</p>
<p>The FT said the Chancellor criticised the Bank of England for paying too much attention to financial futures markets in saying interest rates would have to rise.</p>
<p>&quot;I think in a way that we have have got a counter-inflation culture across to the general public better than to some of the people in the City,&quot; Clarke said.</p>
<p>Last week Bank of England governor Eddie George called for a &quot;modest pre-emptive&quot; rate rise.</p>
<p>UK base lending rates are currently 6.0 percent and were last raised by a quarter of a percentage point on October 30.</p>
