<p>Brazil's soybean crop is enjoying good weather conditions with rains in the southern growing region this week helping to return soil moisture to normal levels, agronomists said.</p>
<p>In Parana, expected to be the largest soybean producing state this year, a continuation of the good weather should guarantee the state will reach its maximum potential, said an agronomist at the state agricultural secretariat.</p>
<p>&quot;We have predicted a range of between 6.2 million and 6.7 million tonnes and if the weather carries on like this, we should easily be harvesting 6.7 million,&quot; Otmar Hubner said.</p>
<p>As of December 5, some 93 percent of forecast area had been planted, of which one percent had already begun flowering.</p>
<p>The bulk - 93 percent - was in the vegetative growth stage, while six percent was germinating, Hubner said.</p>
<p>Hubner expected planting in the state to be completed by the beginning of next week although agronomists at the state cooperatives organisation Ocepar estimated that it would take until December 20 before all the seeds were in the ground.</p>
<p>Even so, this was still very close to the ideal cut-off point for planting of December 15, they said.</p>
<p>In Mato Grosso, expected to be the country's third largest producer, output is seen at five million tonnes according to surveys carried out in the past week, said Luiz Duarte, spokesman at the state agricultural secretariat.</p>
<p>This would represent a small increase on last year but a 10 percent fall from the record 1994/95 harvest, he said.</p>
<p>In Rio Grande do Sul, which until last year was the country's largest soybean producer, planting was around 70 percent completed, said Eloi Hilgert of the state agricultural secretariat.</p>
<p>Independent consultants Safras e Mercado in its estimate at the end of October plotted output in the state at a possible six million tonnes.</p>
<p>However in a recent weekly report, Safras expressed fears credit problems would mean not all the forecast planted area would be sown.</p>
<p>Safras' October forecast was working on the basis of three million hectares and a productivity of 2,000 kgs per hectare.</p>
<p>Hilgert however estimated that around 2.8 million hectares would in fact be used for soybeans and productivity would not rise above 1,800 kgs per hectare, giving output of just over five million tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;I think six million tonnes is too high an estimate. The use of inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides has not been too good here,&quot; Hilgert said.</p>
<p>On the positive side, rains over the last few days have helped refresh areas which had become worryingly dry, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Things have got back to normal. There are some micro-regions that are still without rain but they only represent very small output,&quot; Hilgert said.</p>
<p>Safras e Mercado intends to publish a new estimate for the 1996/97 soybean crop on December 23 but for the time being there do not seem to be any factors which would suggest a great change to its forecast of 26.38 million tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of the climate, everything is going very well. Any problems with dry weather now appear to have been sorted out,&quot; said Safras analyst Flavio Franca.</p>
<p>&quot;My only concern is one of credit problems. This will not have affected beans that have been planted but more the actual area planted. My main concern is in Rio Grande do Sul, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul,&quot; Franca said.</p>
