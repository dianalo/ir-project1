<title>USA: Dell reports sharply higher profits, stock split.</title>
<headline>Dell reports sharply higher profits, stock split.</headline>
<dateline>AUSTIN, Texas 1996-11-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dell Computer Corp. reported a 92 percent jump in third-quarter profits Tuesday, crediting increased sales in Europe and the Americas, and said its board of directors had approved a 2-for-1 stock split.</p>
<p>The world's largest direct marketer of computers posted net income of $145 million, compared with $75 million in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Earnings per share were $1.52 after a special charge of 4 cents per share to pay off part of the Austin, Texas-based company's debt. In the third quarter of 1995, Dell earned 75 cents a share.</p>
<p>Revenues were $2 billion vs. $1.4 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>The stock split, payable Dec. 16 for shareholders of record as of Nov. 25, was the third in the last five years for Dell. Adjusted for the splits, Dell said its shares had appreciated in value more than 2,800 percent since it went public eight years ago.</p>
<p>Dell stock closed down $1.75 at $88.625 before the earnings announcement. In after-hours trading, traders said the stock jumped to $90.50.</p>
<p>The company said its third quarter was highlighted by a 41 percent sales increase in Europe to $482 million and 35 percent sales growth in the Americas to $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;The (Americas) sales gain was driven by continued success with major corporate customers in the United States,&quot; Dell said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said sales of network computers called servers jumped 137 percent from a year ago due to new products and &quot;aggressive pricing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just six months ago, people were saying 'Oh, Dell can't do servers, that will never work.' But here we are,&quot; company founder and Chief Executive Michael Dell told Reuters.</p>
<p>He predicted continued strong market growth for the personal computer industry, driven by lower prices and new computer chips.</p>
<p>&quot;Over a multiyear period, I would put (growth) in the 15-20 percent band. I actually think next year I'd put it closer to 20 percent than 15 percent,&quot; Dell said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you still have this afterglow of the reduction in costs of semiconductors, particularly DRAM (dynamic random access memory), which is driving a huge replacement and new placement cycle because PCs are more cost-effective,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Plus, Dell said, &quot;Intel has one of the most dynamic road maps they've ever had next year ... all these new chips are coming.&quot; Intel Corp is the industry's leading producer of computer chips.</p>
<p>He said he expected Dell to benefit from the introduction of the new products because of its policy of selling directly to customers instead of going through resellers.</p>
<p>&quot;In periods of more rapid product transition, the direct (market) model has been able to take advantage of that,&quot; he said.</p>
