<p>Steeling themselves to abandon their national currencies, Europe's politicians want to be sure it is they and not financial markets who fix the exchange rates at which their countries will join a single currency.</p>
<p>This is why central bankers and officials are considering announcing in advance how rates will be fixed, rather than locking into monetary union on January 1, 1999 at whatever happens to be the currency rates on December 31, 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;The guiding principle is that the sooner it is done the better,&quot; a Bundesbank spokesman said.</p>
<p>Belgian Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt, in a recent interview, told Reuters it was important that European authorities made their decision well before the start of EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody agrees you should have something which is not the rate of the day,&quot;</p>
<p>The theory is that whatever method Europe's leaders announce, markets will know where they expect rates to be at the start of monetary union and push currencies in that direction.</p>
<p>And knowing that Europe's leaders have the power to fix the rates administratively, markets would be less likely than in past European currency crises to call their bluff. LEGAL WEAPON</p>
<p>&quot;This time the central banks have another weapon which is the legal stroke,&quot; said Stefan Collignon, director of research at the Association for Monetary Union of Europe.</p>
<p>At issue are cross-rates between national currencies.</p>
<p>Europe's pledge to make the new euro exchangeable one-for-one for the ecu means that the euro-dollar rate on the first day of monetary union will be the ecu-dollar rate on the last day of 1998.</p>
<p>The ecu is a composite currency, based on a basket weighted according to each country's share in intra-EU trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Fixing the euro rate against the dollar is not a monetary policy decision but the choice of a face-value,&quot; a working paper released in August by French banks and the Bank of France said.</p>
<p>The euro will then be left to find its own value, depending on the monetary policies of the future European Central Bank and economic policies of the countries underpinning it.</p>
<p>Officials are looking at two main ways of fixing national currencies -- using central rates in the existing European Exchange Rate Mechanism or using an average, an idea proposed by European Monetary Institute head Alexandre Lamfalussy.</p>
<p>The central rates have the advantage of being agreed already as the correct reflection of economic fundamentals, but have the drawback of paying no attention at all to market rates.</p>
<p>Using an average could address this drawback and the idea appears to be gaining prominence for the time being.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot take away market considerations,&quot; European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs Yves-Thibault de Silguy said earlier this month, adding however that it was premature to give an indication of how rates would be fixed.</p>
<p>Collignon said, however, it probably did not matter too much which method was used. More important would be the element of self-fulfilling prophecy through an early announcement.</p>
<p>The idea would be to announce the method for fixing rates at the same time as the decision on which countries will join a single currency in 1999, a choice likely to come in April 1998.</p>
<p>Since only those countries which have met Maastricht treaty criteria designed to bring economies into line will get in, there should be no fundamental reason for big currency swings.</p>
<p>At the same time, central banks -- knowing they have the legal power to fix the rates -- will be under no obligation to intervene in currency markets to prop up currencies.</p>
<p>As a result the central bank buying which provided the counterparty that currency speculators required to mop up their heavy selling during the European currency crises of 1992 and 1993 will be absent.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't need to intervene, and because they don't need to intervene the market can't test them out,&quot; Collignon said. BANKNOTES ONLY SYMBOLIC</p>
<p>And once Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is launched, national currency banknotes will be nothing more than a numerical expression of the euro -- so if for example you wanted to change all your francs for marks you could do so.</p>
<p>National banknotes will remain in circulation until 2002.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone will have euros, even if they are labelled francs or marks,&quot; said Francois Chevallier, economist at Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur.</p>
<p>In the extreme case, marks, or euros, could be printed and other currencies burned, with the result that there would no difference in the net liquidity in the euro zone.</p>
<p>That was not the case in the previous crises when the Bundesbank had to print marks to intervene on foreign exchange markets, posing a risk to German money supply.</p>
<p>The overall aim of announcing the method for fixing rates early is to prevent speculators from ramping up currency rates in the run-up to EMU and taking the profits when these are then fixed at the higher level.</p>
<p>Collignon said that this would also be a risk if rates in the months between April 1998 and December 1998 were taken into account in calculating the average.</p>
<p>&quot;If you take the future into your average you have to have a hefty past,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Europe's officials are in any case likely to try keep everybody guessing until the last minute on how they plan to fix exchange rates.</p>
<p>Otherwise, their early announcement would simply mean that speculation started earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;They will be fixed and the world will discover the morning after they have been fixed,&quot; Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker told Reuters earlier this month.</p>
<p>&quot;It would add to speculation if we organised a public debate on the question,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The game is to run ahead of the markets before the markets start pushing the rates in a crazy direction,&quot; ABN-Amro economist Philippe Brossard said.</p>
