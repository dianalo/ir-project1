<p>Ross Perot Wednesday blasted a commission's recommendation that he be excluded from the presidential debates, saying it was &quot;a major setback&quot; for democracy and voters' rights.</p>
<p>The Reform Party presidential candidate said his party would file a lawsuit against Tuesday's recommendation by the Commission on Presidential Debates and would seek a restraining order to delay the debates until a decision was made.  </p>
<p>The commission proposed that Perot be excluded from debates between President Clinton and Republican Bob Dole, saying only Clinton and Dole had a realistic chance to be elected the next president of the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think this is democracy as the framers of the Constitution intended, do you?&quot; Perot asked a large audience in a speech at the Commonwealth Club, a current affairs forum, in San Francisco.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a blatant display of power by the Republicans and the large donors who fund their campaign...,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Perot said the Reform Party would file a lawsuit in federal court against the commission recommendation and would ask the court &quot;to issue a restraining order to delay the debates until a decision is made.&quot;</p>
