<p>Surging world coffee prices and labour unrest in major producing countries has raised concern in Japan about the possibility of further shipment delays, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officials of local trade houses said they were worried about the consequences of labour strife in major Latin American producers such as Brazil and Columbia.</p>
<p>&quot;Some shipments have been delayed, but so far there has been no serious impact on the local market,&quot; one trading house official said.</p>
<p>Other traders said they had not yet experienced delays, but were concerned about the potential for them in the future.</p>
<p>Colombian truck drivers lifted a day-old strike in the Caribbean port of Cartagena on Tuesday, partially dispelling fears that the action could spread to the rest of the country.</p>
<p>In response to news of the end of the strike in Colombia, a coffee trader at a major trade house said: &quot;It's certainly good news. But we're still concerned about on-going labour unrest in Brazil and Colombia.&quot;</p>
<p>New York coffee futures prices have more than doubled since early this year amid depleted consumer inventories and labour unrest in major producing countries.</p>
<p>New York's benchmark July contract ended at 212.85 cents a lb on Tuesday, down 5.65 cents from the previous day.</p>
<p>The sharp price rise has forced coffee roasters in Japan, the third-largest coffee consumer after the United States and Germany, to raise wholesale prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The recent rally in coffee prices was beyond our expectations,&quot; said a senior official at a major coffee roaster. &quot;We had no choice but to resort to raising wholesale prices.&quot;</p>
<p>Another coffee roaster official said: &quot;Local consumers are very sensitive to price differences (among roasters), therefore the decision to raise prices was very risky for us.</p>
<p>&quot;However, we had no choice being faced with two negative factors, higher coffee prices and a weaker yen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Late last month, Ajinomoto General Foods Inc (AGF) said it would raise its wholesale coffee prices by nearly 10 percent from May 1, reflecting the global coffee market's rally and the yen's decline against the dollar since early this year.</p>
<p>AGF, a joint venture between Japan's Ajinomoto Co Inc and Philip Morris Cos Inc's Kraft Foods International Inc, is one of Japan's leading coffee roasters.</p>
<p>UCC Ueshima Coffee Co Ltd, another major roaster, said it would raise wholesale prices by about 20 percent from May.</p>
<p>Japanese warehouse coffee stocks totalled 67,030 tonnes at the end of March, up by 26.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the Agriculture Ministry.</p>
<p>Japan's total green coffee imports in the first three months of this year totalled 85,784 tonnes, against 65,834 tonnes the previous year, the latest Finance Ministry data showed.</p>
