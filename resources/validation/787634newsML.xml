<title>MEXICO: Mexico stocks rest from records on profit-taking.</title>
<headline>Mexico stocks rest from records on profit-taking.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks ended lower on Thursday as dealers took profits in the wake of three record closes in a row.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a healthy move, the market really could not maintain its upward trend the whole time.&quot; said Gerardo Copca, an analyst at the Finamex brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has to give people who have made profits a chance to take them, and for others to step in at lower risk.&quot;</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index ended up 17.60 points, or 0.34 percent, at 5,195.29.</p>
<p>In the broad market, decliners outnumbered gainers by 58 to 41, out of 129 stocks that had changed hands on volume of 132.1 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors did not step in with as much vigour as in recent days, which can be seen in the volume,&quot; a desk trader said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the IPC had rebounded from a midday low of 5,176.35 points on mild bargain-hunting driven in the closing minutes by mild inflation data.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico announced in late trade that consumer prices rose 0.87 percent in July, below the 0.88 percent predicted in a Reuters survey.</p>
<p>Stocks surged to a new trading record of 5,272.87 in early dealing on foreign investment flows, before profit-taking set in. Analysts said a slump in U.S. stock and bond markets also weighed on the bourse.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 71.31 points at 8,188.00, while the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond closed 20/32 lower, raising its yield to 6.53 percent from 6.48 percent at Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>Traders said profit-taking on Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) and Bancomer weighed most on the market.</p>
<p>Telmex shares ended off 15 centavos (2 cents) at 21.50 pesos ($2.75), while the telecommunications company's American Depositary Receipts slid 3/8 to 55-3/16. Financial group Bancomer A shares ended down 8 centavos (1 cent) at 3.75 pesos (48 cents). The two stocks accounted for one-fifth of all shares traded.</p>
