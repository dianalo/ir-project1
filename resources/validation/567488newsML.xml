<title>LUXEMBOURG: Court disallows export refunds on Eastern German goods.</title>
<headline>Court disallows export refunds on Eastern German goods.</headline>
<dateline>LUXEMBOURG 1997-05-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Court of Justice decided on Wednesday that goods imported into the Community from the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) before reunification do not qualify for Community export refunds schemes.</p>
<p>The beef products in this case could not be characterized as originating in, or in free circulation within, the EU, the court said, because they came from a third country and were granted export refunds under the rules of the GDR at the time of import.</p>
<p>The court said that goods processed into West Germany before reunification, under transit and warehousing procedures, and later exported to third countries, could not qualify for export refunds under Community rules.</p>
<p>Community beef and veal export refund schemes are based on the difference between world market prices and Community prices.</p>

<p>EXCERPTS FROM THE JUDGMENT</p>
<p>C-223/95</p>
<p>Reference for a preliminary ruling by the Finanzgericht Hamburg, Germany between</p>
<p>A. MokselAG</p>
<p>and Hauptzollamt Hamburg-Jonas</p>
<p>on the interpretation of article 8(1) of Commission regulation No 3665/87 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (OJ 1987 L 351, p. 1) in conjunction with article 9(2) of the EC treaty</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>THE COURT hereby rules</p>
<p>Article 8(1) of Commission regulation No 3665/87 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products in conjunction with article 9(2) of the EC treaty, are to be interpreted as meaning that products obtained from the slaughter of cattle are neither of Community origin nor in free circulation within the territory of the Community and do not therefore qualify for export refunds if, before 3 October 1990, the date of German reunification, they were exported from the former GDR, following completion of customs export formalities in that country and the grant of export refunds, and imported into the Federal Republic of Germany under the transit and warehousing procedure with a view to being re-exported to a third country.</p>
