<p>London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices gingerly tested the US$2,600 a tonne resistance level in slow Asian trade, Far East dealers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;LME prices are so high, buyers are waiting for some kind of a correction,&quot; a dealer for a metal trading house said.</p>
<p>Three-month copper was quoted by the trade at around $2,595/600 a tonne at 0130 GMT, slightly higher than the late indication in London on Monday of $2,597 a tonne.</p>
<p>One dealer quoted cash copper at $2,695 a tonne while pegging the backwardation at $96.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's certainly selling in the market by the Chinese and everybody else,&quot; one senior trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Copper should go over $2,600 on the LME,&quot; a Japanese dealer said. &quot;But copper is already overbought.&quot;</p>
<p>Apart from copper, Asian base metal business remained slow ahead of the seasonal summer lull with the high prices on the LME discouraging buyers and keeping them on the sidelines, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very, very quiet,&quot; one said.  </p>
<p>Zinc traders said there were reports going around the market that up to 5,000 tonnes of Chinese zinc was due to arrive in Singapore over the next few days.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard about 5,000 tonnes of Chinese zinc will be coming here,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Traders estimate about 10,000 tonnes of zinc remain off-warrant in the city-state. The volume of zinc in the LME's Singapore warehouse reached 25,025 tonnes on Monday against 11,900 tonnes in mid-May.  </p>
<p>Premiums for Western 20-25 kg aluminium ingots rose to $90 a tonne in Singapore from last week's $85 due to a shortage of material, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not much good western stuff in Singapore. That's why the premiums went up slightly,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
