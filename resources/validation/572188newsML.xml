<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-il drew up a war plan in 1992 to capture South Korea in a lightning three-day assault but abandoned the idea because his late father opposed it, a Pyongyang defector was quoted on Friday as saying.</p>
<p>Kwon Young-hae, head of South Korea's Agency for National Security Planning (NSP), told a parliamentary committee that defector Hwang Jang-yop said the younger Kim was still looking for an opportunity to strike against the South.</p>
<p>Kwon's agency has been probing Hwang, the highest-ranked official ever to flee the impoverished country, since he arrived in the South last month. Hwang defected to South Korea through its embassy in Beijing on February 12.</p>
<p>Hwang was quoted as saying Kim Jong-il had made all major policy decisions alone since his father, former president Kim Il-sung, died in 1994.</p>
<p>Two years before his father's death, the junior Kim tried to execute a war plan designed to capture all of the South within three days.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Hwang Jang-yop said the plan was shelved after Kim Il-sung said priority must be given to resolving economic problems,&quot; Kwon said.</p>
<p>Communist North Korea and the capitalist South, split at the end of World War Two, fought a mutually-devastating war in 1950-53 that ended in a truce, not a peace pact.</p>
<p>North Korea has focused efforts on preparing for another conflict since 1974 when Kim Jong-il began playing a leading political role in Pyongyang. A &quot;war atmosphere has dominated since December 1991 when he became the supreme commander (of the army)&quot;, Kwon quoted Hwang as saying.</p>
<p>The North believes if it wages war it will undoubtedly win, and if the United States intervenes, it plans to send suicide squads to bomb U.S. aircraft carriers to create anti-war sentiment in America, Hwang was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Hwang has told NSP investigators that he presumes the North has nuclear weapons but has no details about any nuclear capability because he did not have access to military secrets.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Hwang said he presumed North Korea possessed nuclear weapons as it withdrew from the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) in 1993 while refusing inspections of atomic sites by the IAEA,&quot; Kwon said.</p>
<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, said in April that North Korea had yet to account for an amount of weapons-grade plutonium that experts say it possesses.</p>
<p>The IAEA has never been able to confirm that the North has a nuclear device but insists it has fissionable material it is not owning up to.</p>
<p>A crisis over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons programme was defused after North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities in return for safer reactors promised by the United States under a landmark accord signed in Geneva in 1994.</p>
<p>Hwang was the architect of North Korea's guiding ideology of self-reliance or &quot;juche&quot;.</p>
<p>When he arrived in South Korea on April 20, he said Pyongyang's leaders had abandoned hope for their isolated and famine-stricken nation, were not interested in dialogue with the South and had set the nation on course for war.</p>
<p>Two days after Hwang's arrival, the Chosun Ilbo daily newspaper quoted a document it said he wrote in August, as he prepared to flee his homeland, saying North Korea could turn the South into a &quot;sea of flames&quot; in a nuclear attack.</p>
<p>&quot;The North can turn the South into a sea of flames and annihilate it by using nuclear and chemical weapons and rockets,&quot; the document said.</p>
<p>Diplomats have said Hwang could give an insight into the state of the reclusive nation's government and military as it slides towards famine after being hit by devastating floods in 1995 and 1996.</p>
