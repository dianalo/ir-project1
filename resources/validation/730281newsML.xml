<p>Hizbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon fired a Katyusha rocket into northern Israel on Tuesday, a day after Israeli shelling killed two Lebanese civilians, the Israeli army and Israeli-allied militia sources said.</p>
<p>The Katyusha was one of several fired at Israeli targets.</p>
<p>Most landed inside Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone. One hit a farm near an Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia outpost, injuring a farmer and his 15-year-old son, SLA sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Katyusha rockets were fired this morning at an army base...on the Israel-Lebanon border. One missile fell in an open field inside Israel. No one was wounded and no damage was caused,&quot; an army spokesman said.</p>
<p>Several mortars and Katyushas fired by pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas from south Lebanon have hit the Jewish state this month, most apparently aimed at Israeli troops patrolling a 15-km (nine-mile) south Lebanon occupation zone.</p>
<p>Hizbollah guerrillas said earlier on Tuesday they had fired the rockets in retaliation for Israeli shelling on Monday night that killed two Lebanese civilians in south Lebanon.</p>
<p>&quot;The Katyusha rocketing was in response for the continued violation of April 1996 understanding which bans firing on civilians,&quot; a Hizbollah spokesman told Reuters in Beirut.</p>
<p>The April 1996 ceasefire understanding which ended 17 days of an Israeli onslaught on Lebanon in which about 200 people -- mainly civilians -- were killed, bars Israel and Hizbollah from hitting civilian targets.</p>
<p>Israeli shelling on Monday night killed two civilians in the village of Berti, east of the southern port city of Sidon. The shelling occurred after two SLA militiamen were wounded in a Hizbollah rocket attack on their outpost.</p>
<p>Israel carved out its south Lebanon occupation zone in 1985 to protect its northern border after withdrawing the bulk of its 1982 invasion force.</p>
<p>Hizbollah is fighting a guerrilla war to oust Israeli troops from south Lebanon.</p>
