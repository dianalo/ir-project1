<p>Canadian nickel giant Inco Ltd. reported lower first quarter profits on Tuesday, due to weaker nickel prices, lower deliveries of precious metals and higher production costs.</p>
<p>Inco said net income fell to $58 million, or 27 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31, compared with $63 million or 49 cents a share in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Results for the first quarter of 1997 ... principally reflected lower nickel and cobalt realized prices, increased production costs and lower deliveries of precious metals in the company's primary metals business,&quot; Toronto-based Inco said in a statement.</p>
<p>Inco said it realized an average nickel price of $3.50 per pound in the first quarter of 1997, compared with $3.35 per pound in the fourth quarter of 1996 and $3.78 per pound in the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>First quarter revenues fell to $795 million from $840 million in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Inco said the first quarter results included an after-tax gain of $36 million from the sale of Doncasters Plc., formerly known as Inco Engineering Products.</p>
<p>Through an initial public offering last February, Inco sold Doncasters for gross proceeds of $132 million.</p>
<p>The company's first quarter results also reflected the 50.3 million common shares issued in August, 1996 as part of the acquisition of Diamond Fields Resources Inc. and its rich nickel deposit in Voisey's Bay, Labrador.</p>
<p>Inco said deliveries of all forms of nickel totalled 144 million pounds in the first quarter, up slightly from 143 million pounds in the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>But first quarter deliveries of gold, silver, cobalt and platinum-group metals were down from the previous year's first quarter, Inco said.</p>
