<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-07-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index swept through 16,000 points for the first time on Wednesday and set a record closing high as property stocks returned to favour after spending most of the post-handover period in the doldrums.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index jumped 211.12 points, or 1.34 percent, to close at 15,983.18 after surging to an all-time high of 16,055.19 during the session.</p>
<p>The blue-chip index has gained 5.17 percent since Hong Kong returned to China on July 1 after 156 years under British rule.</p>
<p>&quot;Sentiment has remained favourable,&quot; said Howard Gorges, vice chairman at South China Brokerage.  </p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index scored a record close on its last trading day under British rule on June 29, but property stocks took a beating afterwards as the new administration vowed to tackle the problem of rising property prices in the territory.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Hang Seng properties sub-index led the rally with a 2.97 percent surge.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the obvious thing to do. Every sector has had its day,&quot; said Miles Remington, sales trader at SocGen-Crosby Securities.</p>
<p>Turnover was HK$21.69 billion compared with HK$17.60 billion on Tuesday, with Cheung Kong the most active stock.  </p>
<p>Shares in the property developer rose HK$2.75 to HK$80.75.</p>
<p>&quot;The background on the property stocks has been favourable, with good property sales by Cheung Kong and speculative activity has died down. It is not too surprising that properties have picked up,&quot; said Gorges.</p>
<p>Sun Hung Kai Properties surged HK$3.00 to HK$95.50 and Henderson Land rose HK$3.00 to HK$71.75.</p>
<p>Futures-related activity, ahead of Wednesday's expiry of the July Hang Seng Index contract, and warrant issues also boosted the market, brokers said.</p>
<p>July Hang Seng Index futures closed up 217 points at 15,967.  </p>
<p>Remington said share prices could fall on Thursday following the Hang Seng's 325-point advance this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Sixteen thousand was the target which a lot of brokerage firms had set for this year. The question is, from here how much further can we go? All the sectors have performed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But with a favourable interest rate environment and Chinese economy, Gorges was more optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reason why it should go down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index gained 58.87 points, or 1.70 percent, to 3,524.12.</p>
