<headline>Italy's Prodi greets Blair, family on holiday.</headline>
<dateline>BOLOGNA, Italy 1997-08-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair arrived in Italy on Saturday for informal talks with his counterpart Romano Prodi before beginning a holiday with his wife and children.</p>
<p>Prodi, head of a centre-left coalition, and his wife Flavia welcomed the Labour leader, his wife Cherie and their three children at Bologna airport.</p>
<p>The two heads of government were due to hold brief talks in the centre of the red-walled city while their wives and children went for a quick tour of the sites.</p>
<p>Bologna, Prodi's hometown, is picturesque with charming squares and colonnaded walkways with archectural roots predominantly in the middle ages and Renaissance times. It is also the seat of a 900-year-old university.</p>
<p>The two families were due to lunch together before the Blairs head for Tuscany, where they will holiday a villa belonging to British junior minister Geoffrey Robinson, about 10 kilometres from the mediaeval town of San Gimignano.</p>
