<p>Consolidated Eurocan Ventures Ltd , a small Canadian mining exploration company, was poised to gain control of one of the world's largest unexplored copper-cobalt discoveries on Friday.</p>
<p>The Zaire government agreed to a deal with the Vancouver-based company backed by Geneva-based Swedish financier Adolf Lundin, spokesmen from both sides told Reuters in Zaire. The deal gives Gecamines, Zaire's state-owned mining company, a 45 percent stake in the huge Tenke Fungurume deposit. Eurocan will have a 55 percent stake, sources said.  </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Eurocan in Vancouver said she expected official confirmation by Monday morning.</p>
<p>Eurocan has said it expected to win the property for US$250 million and a commitment to develop the property.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very satisfactory deal for Eurocan, if they've got it,&quot; said Andrew Milligan, president of Cornucopia Resources Ltd, a Vancouver-based company that had also had its eye on Tenke Fungurume.</p>
<p>&quot;It's one of the best projects anywhere in the world.&quot;  </p>
<p>Cornucopia had formed a tentative consortium last spring with metals giants Inco Ltd and Phelps Dodge Corp, hoping to submit a proposal for the project.</p>
<p>But Eurocan's pact freezes Cornucopia out of the running.</p>
<p>The deal gives a hint of some stability in Zaire's business world, said Ken MacLeod, president and chief executive of International Panorama Resource Corp, another Vancouver-based company exploring in Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;It gives a signal that the government is working and it's in business,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;From an investment perspective, it's a powerful message.  </p>
<p>&quot;It means when Gecamines gets involved in an agreement, the government backs them up.&quot;</p>
<p>But some analysts were concerned about the high risks involved in doing business in Zaire, a country plagued by political uncertainty and overrun by crowds of refugees from neighboring Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;Zaire is a basketcase,&quot; said mining analyst Tony Hayes at brokerage Credifinance in Toronto.</p>
<p>The amount of money Eurocan will have to invest and pay for the project is &quot;ridiculous&quot; for the return and the risk the company can expect, he said.</p>
<p>Milligan estimated it would cost about US$300 million for initial development of Tenke Fungurume and up to US$3 billion in total capital costs.</p>
<p>The project was previously explored by a consortium led by Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd, which invested almost US$300 million in the project in the 1970s but walked away because of political risk.</p>
