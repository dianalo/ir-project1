<p>A state oil worker died of his burns on Tuesday and more than 3,000 people were evacuated from their homes as firefighters battled an inferno raging in three huge fuel storage tanks that exploded just outside Mexico City.</p>
<p>At least 14 other people were injured, four of them critically, in Monday afternoon's disaster. Towering columns of flame lit up the Mexico City skyline overnight as thick black smoke billowed three miles (five km) into the air.</p>
<p>The fire flared up when workers from state oil monopoly Pemex were repairing a valve in a tank containing 80,000 barrels of fuel at a storage facility, but the exact cause was not known, Pemex chairman Adrian Lajous said early on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Regrettably, Jose Antonio Ibarra Gonzalez, 34, died today at 10.15 a.m. (1615 GMT),&quot; Pemex said in a later statement.</p>
<p>Lajous, Mexico State Gov. Cesar Camacho and other officials denied any other deaths had occurred, although several newspapers claimed up to four firemen were killed.</p>
<p>Neither Pemex nor the San Juan Ixhautepec district -- known as San Juanico -- are strangers to such disasters. Monday's blast occurred in the same district where a domestic gas explosion 12 years ago burned at least 511 people to death and engulfed homes in flames.</p>
<p>Lajous acknowledged that the blast was the third serious incident involving Pemex in the last two years. In April 1992, more than 200 people died when fuel from a Pemex depot leaked into the Guadalajara sewer system and exploded.</p>
<p>&quot;People don't want to live here anymore; it's not safe,&quot; said a 64-year-old San Juanico man who declined to give his name. &quot;Look at all the tanks of gasoline and houses all around. This is a danger zone.&quot;</p>
<p>Firefighters trained hoses on flames and other nearby tanks, hoping to stop the blaze from spreading. But the size of the fire dwarfed their efforts.</p>
<p>Lajous said he expected the blaze to be extinguished sometime on Tuesday as 100,000 barrels of fuel in the tanks burned off. No property outside the Pemex storage area had been damaged, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to put it out in the next few hours,&quot; he told private radio station Radio Red. &quot;It depends on how fast we burn off all the fuel.&quot;</p>
<p>Company officials admitted that residents of the heavily populated area, about 11 miles (17 km) north of central Mexico City, were still at risk from more tanks exploding until the flames were extinguished.</p>
<p>The thousands evacuated spent the night in shelters or with relatives; however, some were returning on Tuesday despite the danger, fearing their empty homes would be robbed.</p>
<p>Dozens of dazed firefighters, some struggling to stay on their feet, were treated for smoke inhalation by Red Cross workers. Some complained they lacked proper equipment to fight the massive blaze and had not been fed properly during their round-the-clock shifts.</p>
<p>Lajous said he would set up a special committee to study safety issues urgently because &quot;Mexicans deserve a full explanation.&quot;</p>
<p>Concern mounted that the thick smoke would worsen already serious winter pollution in one of the world's filthiest cities. Officials ordered schools to suspend all outdoor activities and recommended that pregnant women, babies and the elderly remain indoors to escape the toxic cocktail of fumes spreading over this city of 18 million.</p>
<p>Other tanks in the facility contained as much as 1.25 million gallons (4.7 million liters) of fuel each but were being slowly drained to prevent new explosions, officials at the oil giant said.</p>
