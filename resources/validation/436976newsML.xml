<p>German designer Karl Lagerfeld unveiled his autumn winter ready-to-wear collection for Chanel on Wednesday, with a return to the 1980s power look and a tribute to Coco Chanel's Slavic infatuation.</p>
<p>Lagerfeld resuscitated Coco Chanel's dalliance with Russia in Kandinsky motif embroidery on slim black evening wear, a blue coat with red Cossack embroidery and the pale, translucent make-up of flapper girls.</p>
<p>There were oversized wool coats for severe Russian winters and soft, cropped, nubby tweed jackets over wide boyish trousers that the grand old lady might have worn herself.</p>
<p>A hint of the gypsy showed in an occasional head scarf or wisps of sheer black that veiled darkly patterned velveteen or hung from dress hems.</p>
<p>Then he zoomed decades forward to sexy black or navy suits with the heavy shoulders of powerful women executives, short pleated skirts and stiletto high heels.</p>
<p>The show was about sleek lines and sombre colours, with few accessories, a far cry from the whimsical theatrics of British designers like John Galliano who unveiled his first collection for Dior on Tuesday, based on Shanghai nightclubs and bobby-socked baby dolls.</p>
<p>&quot;We loved the shoes, the navy suits and the ethic embroidery touches, the cropped jackets with the boyish pants and the wonderful knitwear,&quot; said Nicole Fischlis of Saks Fifth Avenue. &quot;The relaxed sportswear, the return of the big shoulder and the wider pants were great. There was a lot of classic, chic Chanel and very sleek cutting.&quot;</p>
<p>Dawn Mello, president of U.S. department store Bergdorf Goodman was more guarded. &quot;It seemed to be a very eclectic collection. He represented both the soft and sporty clothes and also very strict tailoring in the suits and dresses. There was something for everyone,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Power-dressing is starting to catch on in a big way this season.</p>
<p>Brazilian designer Ocimar Versolato showed it in his hard-edged, square-shouldered zip-up dresses that recall designer Claude Montana, one of the initiators of power dressing.</p>
<p>Hemlines, when they were not at the instep, were high on the thigh, especially on a fringed, single-sleeved black cocktail number and a bridal mini of lace petals.</p>
<p>But Versolato's forte is his evening wear, where he put to use his skilled hand at draping. That meant undulating black velvet skirts beneath off-the-shoulder knit bodices, or plum chiffon veiling a bubblegum pink satin brassiere and skirt.</p>
<p>He handled gazar fabric less deftly, submerging a model's head in one hooded pearl grey gown, but surmounted with finesse some technically difficult smocked chiffon columns in his intense and unusual palette of electric blue, aubergine, cocoa and claret.</p>
<p>&quot;It was absolutely divine,&quot; said Maria Louisa, who owns a chain of shops. &quot;I just loved, loved the zip dresses and absolutely adored the velvet and jersey gowns which are easy to wear without being overdressed. And I loved the smocking.&quot;</p>
