<p>Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said Tuesday he was hopeful the White House and the Republican-controlled Congress would be able to work out an agreement this year to balance the budget.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we have the possibility of resolving our budget problems successfully,&quot; Daschle told reporters shortly before President Clinton was due at the Capitol to meet with leaders of both parties on the budget and other issues.</p>
<p>Daschle said he believed there had been good faith efforts by both parties to avoid the confrontations that had shut down the government briefly last year.  </p>
<p>Daschle said he thought the most difficult issues to resolve would be proposed tax cuts and Medicare financing.</p>
<p>&quot;They (Republicans) are offering again extravagant tax cuts. Ours are much more targeted,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Daschle said the Senate vote on a balanced budget constitutional amendment remained too close to call. The amendment needs 67 votes in the 100-member Senate for the required two-thirds majority.</p>
<p>Daschle said he would not agree to a time for a final vote until all Democrats had a chance to offer their amendments. &quot;We're not going to be pushed into an artificial deadline.&quot;</p>
