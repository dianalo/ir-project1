<p>Yugoslav firms have signed six export contracts worth $108.6 million within a barter deal with China in exchange for crude oil, the Serbian Chamber of Commerce said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The barter arrangement between Serbia's oil company Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS) and Chinese state oil concern Sinochem provides for deliveries of two million tonnes of Chinese crude in exchange for Yugoslav products within 150 days from the date of delivery of the crude.</p>
<p>No details of the value or quantities of Chinese crude delivered on the basis of the barter are available.</p>
<p>The deal, signed in March 1996 initially for a period of one year, was extended last month into a five-year contract.</p>
<p>According to the chamber's report, 167 Yugoslav companies have presented their offers to Sinochem totalling $3.3 billion.</p>
<p>Offers from the machine-building and metal processing industry account for $1.8 billion of the total.</p>
<p>The tractor, engine and agricultural machinery and equipment sector offer is worth $370 million, electrical machines and appliances $200 million, transportation $420 million, shipbuilding $20 million, and chemicals, wood processing, food and construction industries $490 million.</p>
<p>The 14 Oktobar plant of Krusevac has signed a five-year deal on delivery of construction machinery and caterpillar tractors through cooperation and joint production with the Chinese firm Simaco worth $38.4 million.</p>
<p>Industrija Motora i Traktora (IMT) of Belgrade will deliver 1,000 tractors worth $22 million over a period of two years to the Chinese state concern.</p>
<p>Zmaj of Zemun has signed a contract to deliver 500 maize harvesters and 200 combines worth $9.2 million.</p>
<p>Lola Corporation will deliver machine tools worth $1 million, while Cer of Cacak will export processing equipment for dried vegetables worth $850,000.</p>
<p>Viskoza of Loznica has signed a deal for export of viscose fibres valued at $37.2 million with the Chinese silk corporation.</p>
<p>The country's largest iron and steel mill Sartid of Smederevo was not mentioned although last month's report said it had concluded $30 million worth of exports to China.</p>
<p>The chamber of commerce reported earlier that seven deals worth $124.6 million had been struck.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably a deal a Yugoslav company thought had been clinched fell through in the end, but several protocols on cooperation have been signed and we are expecting more concrete agreements in coming months,&quot; a chamber source who asked not to be named told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
