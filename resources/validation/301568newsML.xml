<p>President Boris Yeltsin's latest illness has left a hole in the heart of Russia's political system, prompting calls for major reconstructive surgery on the country's post-Soviet constitution.</p>
<p>The basic law was designed by and for Yeltsin as a means of ensuring strong leadership to drag the country out of communism. It worked while the president was fit. But with Yeltsin nursing pneumonia in hospital on Sunday, just two months after a heart bypass, it is the entire political system that is bedridden.</p>
<p>&quot;Not one senior official will be able to take a single decision of even minimal responsibility,&quot; complained the liberal daily Izvestia after Yeltsin went into hospital on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Leading liberal lawmaker Galina Starovoitova said: &quot;Many people understand that we cannot simply entrust power to a single person, no matter how well we might think of him. We need a redistribution of power between the various branches.&quot;</p>
<p>Change against Yeltsin's will is unlikely if not impossible. But liberals and Kremlin insiders know that when Yeltsin goes, be it when his term ends in 2000 or sooner, his successor may be hardline general Alexander Lebed or a communist. Some preemptive curbs on a future leader may seem wise to the establishment.</p>
<p>The president railroaded the present constitution, modelled broadly on General Charles De Gaulle's French Fifth Republic, through a 1993 referendum held in the aftermath of his armed suppression of conservative foes in the Soviet-era parliament.</p>
<p>It gave him vast powers over central and regional government and relegated parliament to a virtual echo chamber, putting Yeltsin virtually on a par with Russia's tsars -- and the Soviet Communist Party general secretaries he had consigned to history.</p>
<p>The fear among some Russians now is that an invalid Yeltsin could return the country to the sort of &quot;zastoi&quot; or stagnation and corruption seen in the late 1970s when Leonid Brezhnev held all the reins of power in his increasingly senile hands.</p>
<p>Against that, some analysts point to the growing confidence of financial markets -- leading shares soared to record levels as foreign investors poured money into Russia last week -- and the ability of the administration to run the country on its own.</p>
<p>&quot;For the last half a year, both the country and bureaucrats have got used to the participation in name only of the head of state in the country's affairs,&quot; Moskovsky Komsomolets daily said on Sunday. &quot;The mechanism of taking decisions has been well-tuned since the time of his absence in the Kremlin.&quot;</p>
<p>The Communist opposition has long demanded an end to the concentration of power in the presidency.</p>
<p>Lebed, the national security adviser sacked by Yeltsin last October, has lambasted the Kremlin &quot;regency&quot;, by which two unelected officials, chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, effectively rule Russia.</p>
<p>But Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, another potential challenger to Chernomyrdin and Lebed if Yeltsin died or had to quit, dismissed Lebed's constitutional critique as self-serving. He said on Saturday he opposed changing the rules of the game.</p>
<p>The moderate speaker of the Federation Council upper house, Yegor Stroyev, however, called for greater parliamentary powers.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the time is here when we have to take a harder critical look at the current constitution,&quot; he said on Friday. &quot;The country can no longer live by (presidential) decree.&quot;</p>
<p>Yet with the State Duma lower house dominated by communists, Yeltsin is hardly likely to consent to major change. And without his agreement it will be virtually impossible to change the constitution or oust him from the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Supporters of a constitutional amendment must win the backing of three-quarters of the Council, two-thirds of the Duma and two-thirds of Russia's 89 regional assemblies. Similarly daunting arithmetic faces any bid to make Yeltsin stand down.</p>
<p>Some compromise among the various branches of the establishment might yet be forthcoming, however. Ministers and communist legislators cooperated over the 1997 budget last month and some analysts saw it as part of a move toward a less confrontational modus vivendi, at least in private.</p>
<p>Sergei Shakhrai, a leading constitutional lawyer appointed deputy head of the Kremlin administration last month, said at the weekend he opposed any talk of amending the constitution.</p>
<p>But, he told ORT television, there was scope in the existing framework for parliament to have a bigger say. &quot;I favour using the potential that is laid down in the constitution...including the potential to enlarge the roles of the legislature,&quot; he said.</p>
