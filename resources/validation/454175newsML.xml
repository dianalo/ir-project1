<headline>Austrian bonds end weaker on U.S. inflation data.</headline>
<text>
<p>1600 GMT - Austrian bonds slipped lower on Wednesday after the release of stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation data and traders said there was room for further declines.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflation figures did not really change the picture but they were a bit above expectations,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was cautious ahead of U.S. Fed chief Alan Greenspan's testimony, although no rate moves were expected to be announced.</p>
<p>They saw further downward potential based on the fact that the German Bund future had broken out of its day range of 100 to 100.40 points and the lack of support from the U.S. market, weakened by the data.</p>
<p>* 10 year benchmark 5.875 pct bond maturing July 2006 down five bps at 99.50 to yield 5.83 pct (5.82) in bourse trade, quoted post-market at 98.31/39 to yield 5.85/84.</p>
<p>* Latest five-year 4.375 bond maturing February 2002 closed up five bps at 98.90  in bourse trade to yield 4.79 pct (4.80), quoted post-market at 97.81/97.89 to yield 4.81/4.79 percent.</p>
<p>* AGB future up two bps at 107.32 on turnover of 490 lots.</p>
<p>* 10-year spread over Germany up one at minus four bps, five-year spread up one at ten bps.</p>
<p>* Money market rates mixed with three-month VIBOR unchanged at 3.350 and overnight money at 3.08/3.33. -- Vienna newsroom, +431 53112 257</p>
