<p>SIMEX Euroyen futures were firmer while Eurodollars lost some ground late on Tuesday ahead of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting at which the Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fed would be shooting themselves in the foot if they hiked rates now,&quot; said a trader with a U.S. futures house. He said recent U.S. economic data showed no threat of inflation.</p>
<p>Eurodollars and U.S. bonds were likely to continue their recent trend of following moves on Wall Street, where sentiment remained shaken by a growing perception this year's stock market rally might have ended, the trader said.  </p>
<p>Money traders in Tokyo said major Japanese city banks were paying a premium of about 31 to 41 basis points over the prevailing one-month Eurodollar deposit rate of 5.59375 percent as foreign banks became reluctant to lend money ahead of the year-end book closing.</p>
<p>The dealer said September Euroyen would face resistance at 99.36, but showed potential to head for 99.50 in the long term. &quot;So the battle-cry right now is still to buy on dips,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>September Euroyen was quoted at its day high of 99.27 at 1115 GMT against an IMM close at 99.26. Volume was a light 5,810 lots. March JGBs ended at 125.66 against their previous 125.27.  </p>
<p>&quot;I would like to stay short in Eurodollars,&quot; he said, adding that he would sell June Eurodollars on any rises to 94.35.</p>
<p>The June contract finished at 94.30 against its IMM close at 94.32. March ended at 94.42 against 94.45.</p>
<p>Euroyen futures gained ground on the back of a rise in Japanese government bond (JGB) futures, but dealers said trade remained thin and lacklustre due to the year-end holidays.</p>
<p>&quot;The Japan premium -- the extra cost of fund-raising for Japanese banks -- has been widening and that's giving support to Euroyen futures,&quot; said the dealer.  </p>
