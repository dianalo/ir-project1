<p>China is to ban the granting of loans to small enterprises with serious pollution problems, the Agricultural Bank and the National Environmental Protection Agency announced.</p>
<p>Loans will only be granted to enterprises that strictly abide by national environmental policies, they said in a joint circular issued on Thursday and reported by the China Daily on Friday.  </p>
<p>Local branches of the Agriculture Bank that grant loans to polluting factories will be punished, the circular said.</p>
<p>Branches were ordered to recover loans from factories closed down in a campaign since last September to shut small factories engaged in 15 pollution-prone industries, including pulp, hide-processing and dye production, it said. The accounts of these plants have been frozen and their property sealed.</p>
<p>The blacklisted plants include paper mills with an annual production of less than 5,000 tonnes, tanneries producing less than 30,000 pieces of hide a year and factories producing less than 500 tonnes of dye a year, it said.</p>
<p>Less-polluting facilities and workshops of the closed factories may be leased to recoup loans, it said.  </p>
<p>Bank branches were ordered to carry out an examination of loans to township and village enterprises engaged in pollution-causing industries as well as in areas where water pollution was serious, it said.</p>
<p>If construction of new projects does not include environmental protection facilities or undergo an environmental assessment, then loans already extended must be recalled and no new loans are to be granted, it said.</p>
<p>Development of environmentally-friendly industries would receive priority in obtaining loans, it said.</p>
<p>China has announced the closure last year of thousands of small township and village enterprises found to be polluting the environment.</p>
