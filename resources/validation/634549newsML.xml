<p>Sri Lanka stocks closed slightly lower on Tuesday as the market struggled to familiarise itself with screen-based trading after the stock exchange began automation trials, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously, the people were cautious,&quot; said Sanjeeva Gunewardena of Ceylinco Stock Brokers. &quot;I think it contributed to the low turnover of the day.&quot;</p>
<p>The all-share index closed 1.7 points lower at 730.1 on turnover of 30.4 million rupees. On Monday, the all share closed 0.15 points lower at 731.75 on turnover of 69.5 million rupees.  </p>
<p>Adding to the day's turnover were 78,300 Grain Elevators at 24 rupees, 55,700 Kegalle Plantations at 34.50 rupees and 32,600 Dockyard at 18.25 rupees. Blue chip Development Finance dropped 10 rupees to 270 rupees. Haycarb fell 10 rupees to 90 rupees.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a lot of buyers, but sellers were far fewer,&quot; said another broker. &quot;Basically, it shows that the market is strong and sellers are not willing to part with their stocks at current levels.&quot;</p>
