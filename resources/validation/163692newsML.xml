<p>Philippine coconut oil prices will probably move up this week because of tight supply, vegetable oil traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>Prices went up last week on market talk of a delay in a 35,000-tonne shipment of coconut oil, traders said, but the report could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>&quot;Quantities being shipped to Rotterdam and other export markets are not enough to meet rising demand,&quot; said one Manila-based trader.  </p>
<p>&quot;Everybody's expecting supply to increase in the last two months, but it is not coming,&quot; an executive at one of the country's largest coconut oil millers said.</p>
<p>Tight supply also caused delays in the shipment of coconut oil to other major markets like the United States, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Coconut oil sellers for nearby months soared to US$747.50 per tonne CIF on Friday from $725 at the start of the week, while buyers quoted $740 per tonne CIF from $715 at the start of the week,&quot; said another trader.  </p>
<p>Traders said demand for coconut oil rose in Rotterdam and other export markets as manufacturers bought ahead of the Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>But one trader said he expected profit-taking to emerge later this week following the runup in prices.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect some traders to take profit by unloading some of their stocks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Coconut oil exports remain weak, dealers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;I expect Philippine coconut oil exports to reach only 75,000 tonnes in October as against 107,630 tonnes in October 1995,&quot; said one trader, adding that his data came from shipping companies.</p>
<p>The trader said he expected actual export shipments of Philippine coconut oil from January to October at 674,000 tonnes, down 40 percent from the 1.128 million tonnes in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The trade group United Coconut Associations of the Philippines said the country exported some 2.342 million tonnes of coconut products, worth nearly $1.1 billion, in 1995.  </p>
