<p>Hungary's central bank may consider lowering interest rates further, if inflationary pressures continue to slow, the bank's president said.</p>
<p>If inflation continues to decline and meets expected targets, then &quot;I would not rule out further cuts,&quot; Gyoergy Suranyi told Reuters Financial Television in an interview.</p>
<p>Suranyi was in Basle for the annual meeting of the Bank of International Settlements.  </p>
<p>Suranyi was optimistic the central bank would reach its goal of reducing inflation to 12 percent by the end of 1998 and even approach single digit inflation rate levels in the next 18 to 24 months.</p>
<p>&quot;Fortunately we are on track (to meet that goal),&quot; Suranyi said. For 1997 Suranyi predicted a slowdown, leaving inflation rates below 18 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We will definitely be below 18 percent, 17.8 percent might be realistic,&quot; Suranyi said, adding the tendency is clearly moving in the &quot;right direction this year.&quot;</p>
<p>In light of the current double-digit inflation rate, Suranyi said however it would be premature to consider altering the nation's foreign exchange regime at the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;For the time being we do not see any reason to move away&quot; from the nation's system, Suranyi said explaining that as long as Hungary's inflation rate remained significantly above those posted by its trading partners, &quot;we have to keep a quasi fixed exchange rate regime.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked what type of system Hungary might adopt in the future, Suranyi said it was premature to speculate, saying he could not rule out either a fixed or a managed floating system.</p>
<p>But he said &quot;I cannot forsee a freely floating system.&quot; Suranyi also said that Hungary was not negatively impacted by the Czech crown's dramatic problems in recent weeks, noting &quot;this is probably an exception in the region.&quot;</p>
<p>One reason for this may be linked to the nations' different privatisation strategies, Suranyi said, noting Hungary enjoyed stricter market regulation and a different type of capital inflow.</p>
