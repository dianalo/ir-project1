<headline>Unihold acquires firm from M&amp;R unit.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1997-06-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Unihold Ltd announced on Tuesday, subject to certain suspensive conditions, it had acquired Protea Technology Ltd (PTL) from Tradmin Engineering Holdings Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Murray and Roberts Holdings Ltd.  </p>
<p>The acquisition is with effect from June 30, 1997.</p>
<p>Tradmin Engineering Holdings Ltd (TEHL) has agreed that the purchase price will not be less than 34.4 million rand.</p>
<p>It will be settled by the allotment of 8.05 million new Unihold shares which will be placed on behalf of TEHL with selected investors.</p>
<p>The purchase consideration will be an amount equal to the issued share capital, the share premium account, the non-distributable reserves, plus the shareholders loan accounts against PTL as reflected in the audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 1997.  </p>
<p>In the event that the purchase consideration exceeds 34.4 million rand, Unihold will pay such additional amount to TEHL in cash within seven days of receipt by Unihold of the effective date accounts.</p>
<p>The acquisition is subject to the conclusion of a due diligence investigation by PTL, approval by TEHL and Unihold boards, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange granting a listing to the consideration shares and PTL's major principals sanctioning the change of control in PTL.  </p>
<p>PTL is a distributor, value added reseller and manufacturer of high technology equipment.</p>
<p>Unihold said the rationale behind the acquisition was that Murray and Roberts had embarked upon a controlled disposal strategy of non-core business and PTL was one of these.</p>
<p>&quot;Unihold believes that the future growth prospects for PTL are most encouraging,&quot; it said.</p>
