<text>
<p>A handpicked China panel preparing Hong Kong for its return to Beijing's rule has proposed the shape of the territory's next legislature.</p>
<p>China has said it will install the provisional legislature after Hong Kong reverts to Beijing's control in mid-1997 and dismantle the territory's current elected Legislative Council.</p>
<p>Beijing's plans have been fiercely opposed by Hong Kong's government, pro-democracy activitists and legislators.</p>
<p>The new legislature should have 60 members, mainly Chinese nationals who are Hong Kong permanent residents without rights of abode overseas, a sub-group of the Beijing-appointed Preparatory Committee proposed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong permanent residents who are not Chinese nationals, or who have rights of abode abroad, can constitute no more than 20 percent of the provisional legislature's membership, it said.</p>
<p>Candidates to the legislature must be Hong Kong permanent residents aged 18 years or over, who support the Basic Law -- Hong Kong's post-handover constitution promulgated in 1990 -- and are willing to be loyal to the SAR.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, reverts to Beijing at midnight on June 30, 1997 and becomes a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China.</p>
<p>The candidates will be nominated and elected by members of the Selection Committee, a 400-member body to be formed to choose Hong Kong's post-handover leader and provisional legislature.</p>
<p>The recommendations must still be passed in a committee meeting in October, the preparatory panel said in a statement.</p>
