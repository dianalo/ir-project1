<p>China has sentenced two veteran democracy activists to hard labour for up to three years, a fellow dissident said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Authorities in Taiyuan in central China's Shanxi province sentenced Fu Guoyong to three years of re-education through labour, the dissident told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>Fellow activist Chen Ping, who had worked with Fu on pro-democracy tracts, had been sentenced to one year of labour reform, said the dissident who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason was because they published articles abroad about democracy,&quot; said the dissident. &quot;They just wrote some articles. There really was no reason for this.&quot;</p>
<p>Authorities had branded the essays counter-revolutionary, said a statement by the Information Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.</p>
<p>Taiyuan police detained Fu, 29, in late July for what they said were illegal political activities.</p>
<p>Chen, 45, had been arrested in Taiyuan in August and was sentenced together with Fu, the source said, adding he did not know when the sentences had been passed.</p>
<p>Police in Taiyuan contacted by telephone declined to comment on the cases. Family members were not available.</p>
<p>Fu moved to Taiyuan in late June, complaining of repeated harassment by police in Hangzhou city in the eastern province of Zhejiang, where he had been living with his wife.</p>
<p>Fu previously served two years in a labour camp for his role in the student-led demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the military with heavy loss of life on June 4, 1989.</p>
<p>Police detained Fu for more than a month in December 1995 after he, along with dissidents Wang Donghai and Chen Longde, wrote a letter calling for the release of Wei Jingsheng, widely regarded as the father of China's modern democracy movement.</p>
<p>Fu also joined in an appeal with Wang and Chen Longde to China's parliament before the 1996 anniversary of the bloody June 4 crackdown, demanding the release of those jailed for their involvement in the movement.</p>
<p>Fu and Chen Ping's sentences come amid a widening crackdown on dissent by Beijing. Most dissidents are already serving lengthy sentences in prisons or labour camps or have been forced into exile.</p>
<p>China drew international condemnation when a Beijing court sentenced former student leader Wang Dan to 11 years in prison in October for conspiring to subvert the government.</p>
<p>Beijing dismisses criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.</p>
<p>A Chinese court last week sentenced dissident Zhang Zong'ai to five years in prison for counter-revolutionary incitement.</p>
<p>Three pro-democracy activists are currently standing trial on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement in Hefei, capital of the central province of Anhui.</p>
<p>In the southern boomtown of Shenzhen that borders Hong Kong, two labour activists are standing trial for conspiring to subvert the government.</p>
