<p>Mother Teresa remained in serious condition with a weak heart on Saturday, but a doctor said the revered Roman Catholic nun was showing surprising strength as she battled for her life.</p>
<p>&quot;She is showing enormous strength given her age, which has surprised all of us,&quot; Dr S.K. Sen, medical director of Calcutta's Woodlands Nursing Home, told reporters in this eastern Indian city.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa's 86th birthday is next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sen said Mother Teresa's fever had fallen and her malaria was under control, but she remained on a respirator in the intensive care unit of the hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;It is worrisome,&quot; he said. &quot;It (her condition) is still serious. Her condition is still unchanged. She is conscious. Her cardiac condition remains unstable.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier, local news agencies quoting unnamed authorities said the condition of the world-renowned nun had improved on Saturday morning and she was in stable condition.</p>
<p>Sen said doctors had been able to contain the malaria, and her fever had fallen to 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37.2 Celsius) from 100 degrees (37.8 Celsius). The doctor said there had been no significant complications on Saturday.</p>
<p>A medical bulletin released by the hospital said Mother Teresa was being treated with antibiotics for a chest infection.</p>
<p>But Sen said Mother Teresa, winner of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize and known as the Saint of the Gutters for her work with the world's poor and destitute, was unable to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;She continues to have respiratory support,&quot; Sen said. &quot;She is not able to speak. She is just making gestures. We are keeping strict vigilance around the clock.</p>
<p>&quot;We tried to take her out of the respirator yesterday but we failed. We would like to wean her out of it later today.&quot;</p>
<p>A six-member team of medical specialists has been treating the diminutive nun, who was taken to hospital on Tuesday with a high fever and severe vomiting.</p>
<p>While the fever due to malaria had dropped, her heartbeat had remained irregular for the past 48 hours, he said.</p>
<p>Sen said: &quot;She has not improved. Neither can I say it has deteriorated. We are giving her the same treatment as we would have given to anybody else. But in her case we are feeling the pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>The doctor said he was spending half of his day taking telephone inquiries from around the world, and that hospital authorities were allowing only a small number of nuns from Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity order to visit her.</p>
<p>A crowd gathered in Calcutta at the gates of Missionaries of Charity, which has been the hub of Mother Teresa's worldwide efforts to help the poor with nearly 3,000 people ministering to the needy, dying and orphaned in the slums of 200 cities.</p>
<p>Letters poured in from around the world, including messages from Pope John Paul II and Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, nuns at her Missionaries of Charity religious order said.</p>
