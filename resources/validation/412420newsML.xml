<p>South Korean president Kim Young-sam on Friday replaced his top aides, kicking off a sweeping administration reshuffle designed to restore his credibility following a loans scandal.</p>
<p>Kim dropped his chief secretary and three other top advisers responsible for political, economic and general affairs, a presidential spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the start of a major reshuffle in the government and the ruling party,&quot; he said. &quot;The cabinet reshuffle is expected early next week.&quot;</p>
<p>Kim Yong-tae, a former home affairs minister who served four terms in parliament, would succeed Kim Kwang-il as chief of staff at the presidential Blue House.</p>
<p>All members of Kim Young-sam's Blue House inner circle, the entire cabinet and ruling New Korea Party leaders had offered to step down after the president apologised publicly on Tuesday over a loans-for-kickbacks scandal.</p>
<p>Kim Young-sam took ultimate responsibility for the scandal around the failed Hanbo Steel Co although he was not accused of any personal wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The chief Blue House political officer, Lee Won-jong, was replaced by Kang In-sop, a former member of parliament and an ex-journalist. His counterpart in charge of economic affairs, Lee Suk-chae, stepped down in favour of Kim In-ho, currently head of the Fair Trade Commission.</p>
<p>Under South Korea's presidential system, in which power is concentrated in the Blue House, Kim's aides have wielded great influence over policy.</p>
<p>Political analysts said the president appeared to be fighting to regain his political credibility and avoid being labelled a lame duck during his last year in office. The Hanbo scandal underlined the failure of President Kim's much-vaunted anti-corruption drive, and he promised on Tuesday to heed criticism that his close associates were incapable of carrying through reforms.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said banks, under pressure from politicians, offered huge loans in return for kickbacks from Hanbo, which racked up $5.8 billion in debts before going bankrupt on January 23.</p>
