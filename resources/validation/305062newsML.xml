<p>Sponsors have made Martina Hingis a multi-millionaire at 16, putting the Swiss teenager under growing pressure to become world number one.</p>
<p>Italian sportswear company Sergio Tacchini has  agreed to spend at least $7.5 million on the Swiss player, betting that she will one day do as her vanquished opponents predict and topple Steffi Graf from the top of women's tennis.</p>
<p>&quot;She starts to feel the pressure now,&quot; the company's head of sponsorship, Leo Bassi, admitted on Tuesday after announcing the five-year deal, which could bring Hingis millions of dollars more in ranking and tournament bonuses.</p>
<p>&quot;She was too young only 18 months ago to feel everything. I still don't think she realises how much money she has, because she has no time to spend it,&quot; Bassi said.</p>
<p>Hingis was burying German Barbara Rittner's hopes of an Australian Open second-round berth when the deal was announced and she merely shrugged when reporters later asked how it felt to be so rich at her age.</p>
<p>&quot;I know what contracts I've got but I just don't care. You just play your tennis,&quot; she said, a little embarrassed. &quot;I just play and that's what I get.&quot;</p>
<p>Hingis leaves the deal-making to her mother and coach, Melanie, and concentrates on matters on the court where she is, according to her peers, developing into a champion.</p>
<p>&quot;She's had an incredible year. Especially in the last few months, she seemed not afraid of playing the top players and not afraid of winning tournaments,&quot; said 21-times Grand Slam champion Graf before launching her own Australian Open campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;She's definitely one of the few players who will always make life difficult,&quot; said Graf, who lost to the sometimes temperamental Hingis at last year's Italian Open.</p>
<p>Hingis also notched up a victory last November over world number two Monica Seles in Oakland, becoming the youngest ever tennis player, man or woman, to earn $1 million in prize money at the tender age of 16 years, one month and 10 days.</p>
<p>&quot;Martina is tennis,&quot; said Bassi. &quot;When people talk about tennis, they talk about Hingis. They don't talk about (Pete) Sampras or (Andre) Agassi, they talk about Hingis. She's the next generation, going towards 2000....&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who knows? Maybe (Graf) can play one or two more years but apart from Martina we don't see any other names. At the moment, the best investment in tennis is Martina Hingis.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the contract, Hingis receives an annual retainer of $1.5 million for five years and stands to earn up to a total of $12 million over that time with performance bonuses if she reaches number one, Bassi said.</p>
<p>For now, corporate pressures do not appear to weigh on the world number four, who spends her days off from the Australian Open roller-blading, horse-riding and going shopping with a fraction of the wealth accumulating in her bank account.</p>
<p>Asked on Tuesday if she felt pressure to perform, Hingis said: &quot;Not at all...It's a great feeling to be out there and for people to be enjoying you playing great tennis.&quot;</p>
<p>Hingis believes she will not follow in the footsteps of former teenaged prodigy Jennifer Capriati, who left the tour in 1994 complaining of burn-out and whose Grand Slam comeback ended in tears here on Tuesday.</p>
<p>With some $10 million riding on Hingis over the next five years, Bassi has to share that belief.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not possible. No way at all. It will never happen.&quot;</p>
