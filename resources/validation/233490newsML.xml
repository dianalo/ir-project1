<p>The international community told Bosnia's ethnic leaders on Wednesday to stick to the terms of the year-old Dayton peace pact or risk losing major foreign aid and entry into the civilised world.</p>
<p>It also lashed out at the Serbian leadership for its clampdown on opposition voices in Belgrade, saying the unrest could help derail the fragile Bosnian peace deal.</p>
<p>The international community has agreed to maintain a 30,000-strong force in Bosnia over the next 18 months to prevent former enemies from resuming combat but much remains to be done to implement the civilian aspects of Dayton.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to make clear that a deal is a deal and the signatories to the peace agreement must live up to their obligations in every respect,&quot; said Carl Bildt, the international community's High Representative in Bosnia.</p>
<p>Bildt, addressing a major conference to gauge progress on the Bosnian peace process, said many aspects of Dayton had been ignored and expressed particular concern at the failure of the three ethnic communities to hand over indicted war criminals.</p>
<p>&quot;If there are not developments in the very near future, we will discuss different ways of dealing with this issue in a more direct way,&quot; he told a news conference, but declined to say what measures might be taken.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the 75 indicted criminals remain at large one year after peace broke out, despite widespread evidence of genocide and other crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>The conference was largely overshadowed by the mounting turmoil in Belgrade, where 120,000 people marched through the streets on Wednesday to demand President Slobodan Milosevic resign after the closure of an independent radio station.</p>
<p>U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum said the state of democracy in Serbia was &quot;deplorable&quot; and laid the blame on Milosevic.</p>
<p>&quot;To try and isolate himself, to try and maintain an undemocratic system, not only harms the Serbian people...but threatens to transform Serbia into an isolated and dangerous island of instability inside a region which is trying to build peace,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Western officials say more than a million refugees have still to be allowed home, human rights abuses are being committed by all sides and accuse the Moslems, Serbs and Croats of doing little to cooperate for the common good.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not yet had real evidence of real political will by the Bosnian parties to work together to rebuild their country,&quot; British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told reporters.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister John Major made it plain the West would be looking for a series of detailed political undertakings from the Bosnian leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;The international community will in turn undertake to provide substantial further help and resources, both human and financial,&quot; he told the conference.</p>
<p>&quot;But this international help will be conditional on the willingness in Bosnia and Herzegovina to implement all aspects of the peace agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>Implementation of the peace agreement has largely fallen to the 60,000-strong NATO force, which is due to leave Bosnia this month and be replaced by a slimmed-down force half its size.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the North Atlantic alliance planned to review the size of its international peacekeeping force in Bosnia next June and December with a view to reducing it substantially in 1998.</p>
