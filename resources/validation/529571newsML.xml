<p>NATO's military chiefs met on Tuesday to try and agree a streamlined command structure which would allow the alliance to cut defence expenditure while gaining greater flexibility for more varied types of missions.</p>
<p>NATO sources said the alliance's 16 Chiefs of Defence Staffs (CHODs) were set to agree reforms which would divide Europe into two zones, one North and one South, but faced problems carving up a lower level of regional commands between member states.</p>
<p>Britain, which is set to lose a central European zone command headquarters, has said it will not back the proposals if other countries are not seen to be making sacrifices at a lower level of command.</p>
<p>&quot;London is saying it will not fall on the sword unless others are also willing to make savings. We must avoid a proliferation of regional commands which eliminate savings we make from cuts higher up,&quot; said one alliance military source.</p>
<p>The current package of reforms, considered crucial if NATO is to have a real role in the post-Cold War world and take in new members from former communist Europe, seeks to move from 65 headquarters at four command levels to 25 at three levels.</p>
<p>&quot;That is the easy bit, the problem is the share-out of the lower level. Every country backs the idea but wants to keep any headquarters on its own soil,&quot; added the source.</p>
<p>NATO, created to defend the West from a huge attack from the Soviet Union which never happened, has traditionally adopted a defensive posture which leaves it ill-placed for &quot;out-of-theatre&quot; Bosnia-style peacekeeping operations.</p>
<p>The plans are designed to allow smaller groups of NATO members, often working with non-NATO countries, to take part in security operations on the continent which do not need the huge back-up and fire-power of the Cold War military alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;It is often forgotten that NATO is the most powerful and effective military alliance ever created. We want to retain that while allowing it to move into a new era at the same time as replying to pressures to deliver on the peace dividend,&quot; said one senior alliance diplomat.</p>
<p>NATO sources say countries cannot agree where to place the lower level commands which would become the headquarters for regional operations and are consequently a mark of prestige, particularly for smaller nations.</p>
<p>&quot;There are problems with the Joint Sub-Regional Commands (JSRCs) in both north and south Europe,&quot; said one military official.</p>
<p>In Scandinavia, both Norway and Denmark, which currently both have a command at &quot;level 4&quot;, are competing for a JSRC which would combine the two at the new lowest third tier level.</p>
<p>Denmark, which has taken up the diplomatic cudgels on behalf of the Baltic states, wants to be able to carry out partnership operations with those countries, particularly as they are unlikely to gain alliance membership.</p>
<p>Norway, however, is reluctant to give up its own command, arguing the centre of gravity within the alliance is shifting southwards and its border with Russia leaves it well-placed for joint confidence-building exercises with the old foe.</p>
<p>In the south, Greece, Turkey, Italy, Spain and Portugal all want a command on their territory.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is the military say we only need two, and we have not been able so far to agree anything below four,&quot; added the diplomat.</p>
<p>NATO diplomats say the military will agree the broad outlines of the reformed structure, but leave defence ministers to deal with the political horse-trading required to clinch a deal ahead of a special summit in Madrid next July.</p>
<p>That summit is set to invite some applicant countries to join the alliance, endorse a new pact with Russia, and agree a new command structure.</p>
