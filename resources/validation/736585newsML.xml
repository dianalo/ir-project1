<p>AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, posted record second-quarter earnings Wednesday but said domestic operations could face pressure during the third quarter.</p>
<p>AMR earned $302 million, or $3.26 per diluted share, in the second quarter ended June 30, which topped Wall Street analysts' expectations of $3.21 and beat last year's second-quarter earnings of $293 million, or $3.35 per diluted share.</p>
<p>Total operating revenues rose to $4.71 billion from $4.55 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR said its second-quarter revenues were dampened by the return of the passenger excise tax and a strike by pilots earlier this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Although some residual losses resulting from the earlier threat of a pilot strike and the reimposition of the domestic excise tax adversely impacted our results, our year-over-year improvement reflects strong demand for summer air travel ... and some substantive improvement in our operating performance,&quot; AMR Chairman Robert Crandall said in a statement.</p>
<p>As part of contentious labor negotiations earlier this year, American Airlines pilots went on strike Feb. 15. But they were sent back to work within minutes by a presidential emergency board established to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>Although the pilots' strike was short-lived, passengers had already booked flights on other airlines to avoid being stranded.</p>
<p>The lost bookings cut second-quarter earnings by &quot;less than $10 million,&quot; which was far less than the $70 million impact seen during the first quarter, said AMR Chief Financial Officer Gerald Arpey.</p>
<p>In addition to the strike, American also felt the effects of the passenger excise tax, which was reinstated in March. The 10 percent tax, which normally goes to the Federal Aviation Administration, was not in effect during last year's second quarter, giving American and all airlines a cash windfall and inflating year-ago revenues.</p>
<p>AMR's better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, as well as its announcement that it will repurchase up to $500 million in common stock over the next two years, pushed its stock price up $4.44 to $99.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Other airline stocks rallied on AMR's strong earnings, boosting the American Stock Exchange airline index 13.60 points, or 2.8 percent, to 499.56.</p>
<p>But analysts cautioned that other airlines may see flat-to-slightly-lower second-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;American may be the exception rather than the rule. American did better than expected, and it may turn out that they may do better than the rest of the industry,&quot; said Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst with Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>American, the first of the major airlines to report second-quarter results, also offered the first outlook for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very mixed message. On the one hand, they were saying business is very strong; on the other hand, they're saying there's some pressure. I think the second quarter was driven entirely by international, and international will be carrying the day,&quot; said Helane Becker, an airline analyst with brokerage Smith Barney .</p>
<p>AMR said the continued effects of the excise tax, as well as fares sales and competition from low-cost carriers, may hurt its domestic operations. International operations, however, appear robust.</p>
<p>&quot;I think on the domestic side we're going to have a bit of a challenge, but the strength in the international operations will mitigate much of the potential domestic weakness,&quot; Arpey told reporters in a conference call following the earnings announcement.</p>
