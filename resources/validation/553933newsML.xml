<p>Free-market reformer P. Chidambaram returned as India's finance minister on Thursday as Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral inducted six ministers into his 11-day-old centre-left government.</p>
<p>Chidambaram, considered an engine for economic reforms, was finance minister in the government of Gujral's predecessor, H.D. Deve Gowda, who stepped down after losing a vote of confidence on April 11.</p>
<p>The 51-year-old Chidambaram was inducted with three others from his Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) party, which finally joined the government after earlier opting out because its leader, G.K. Moopanar, was bypassed in the leadership race.</p>
<p>The TMC's decision on Tuesday to join the government was greeted by stock markets with enthusiasm, as it boosted the prospects that parliament would approve Chidambaram's landmark 1997/98 (April-March) budget.</p>
<p>&quot;I am confident that parliament will pass the budget,&quot; Chidambaram told reporters after being sworn in.</p>
<p>Minutes after being sworn in at the presidential palace, he was deep in conversation with his aide, Finance Secretary Montek Singh Ahluwalia. &quot;You can come right away,&quot; he told Ahluwalia.</p>
<p>Chidambaram sought to calm fears that communists in the governing alliance of regional parties, free traders and leftists could dramatically change proposed budgetary cuts in corporate and individual taxes and import tariffs. &quot;In the debate we will convince them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The lower house of parliament, which reconvened on Wednesday, was scheduled to begin debating the budget next week and to put it to the vote by May 9.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't feel any pressure. I will consider their amendments carefully,&quot; Chidambaram said, when asked about the changes suggested by the Left and the Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). &quot;I will accept suggestions.&quot;</p>
<p>Two leaders from Gujral's Janata Dal party also took the oath as ministers on Thursday, including Jaipal Reddy, who was named the new information and broadcasting minister.</p>
<p>Reddy filled in the slot vacated by C.M. Ibrahim, a confidant of Deve Gowda who had held the job in the previous government and retained the civil aviation portfolio.</p>
<p>While the TMC's return to the United Front government cheered its leaders, Gujral's Janata Dal party was in the grip of a corruption scandal involving its president, Laloo Prasad Yadav, and a federal minister, Chandradeo Prasad Varma.</p>
<p>The federal police on Sunday said it would prosecute Yadav, chief minister of the eastern state of Bihar, in a 10 billion rupee ($280 million) &quot;fodder scam&quot; that involves the alleged illegal siphoning off of animal welfare funds.</p>
<p>Both Yadav and Varma say they are innocent and have not accepted opposition demands they step down to face trial.</p>
<p>The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has said it will seek the Bihar state governor's permission to prosecute Yadav.</p>
<p>&quot;Who am I to decide?,&quot; Gujral said cryptically on Thursday when asked by reporters if he planned to take action against Yadav, whose refusal to quit has embarrassed the coalition.</p>
<p>The scandal hit the coalition as it was recovering from the wounds of a political crisis that led to Gujral's election and Deve Gowda's exit as part of a deal to win back vital parliamentary support from the Congress party.</p>
