<p>Lithuania's Agricultural Bank said on Friday its net profit during first five months of the year was 8.6 million litas, which was 3.2 million litas below the result of the the first four months of the year.  </p>
<p>Spokeswoman for the bank, Imandra Daukshiene, told Reuters that the fall in profit in May was planned and would not affect the full-year forecast of 27 million litas.</p>
<p>The bank posted 11.8 million litas net profit for the first four months of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank plans to use 22.6 million litas of the profit for upgrading the computer network and other immediate needs, so the net profit for 1997 will amount to around 4.4 million litas,&quot; Daukshiene added.</p>
<p>She also said that final figures for the bank's assets, loans and deposits for the end of May are expected in the first half of next week.</p>
<p>The bank is one of the two state-run banks slated for privatisation by the country's government.</p>
<p>Agricultural Bank is one of the country's biggest banks in terms of assets and the state has 86 percent of it.</p>
<p>The share capital of the bank stands at 128 million litas and a general shareholders' meeting on Friday is expected to boost it by over 40 million litas from additional contributions to meet capital adequacy requirements.</p>
<p>The capital adequacy ratio of the bank stood at 9.18 percent as of May 1. The minimum required by the Bank of Lithuania is 10 percent.</p>
