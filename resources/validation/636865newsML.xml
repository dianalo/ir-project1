<p>A small far-right party with a key position in Turkey's parliament on Wednesday threatened to turn against Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan if he did not push through electoral reforms in their favour.</p>
<p>&quot;If the electoral threshold is not brought down to five percent, we will bring down the coalition,&quot; Anatolian news agency quoted Orhan Kavuncu, vice chairman of the Grand Unity Party (BBP), as telling a news conference.</p>
<p>Under Turkish law, a party must win 10 percent of the national vote to win seats in parliament. The rule, designed to foster stable government by excluding small parties, helped Erbakan's Welfare Party at the last general polls.</p>
<p>Erbakan last weekend announced a plan to go to early elections under a caretaker government headed by his coalition partner Tansu Ciller but he did not set a date for polling.</p>
<p>He said he would like the BBP, which has backed him in previous tight votes, to be part of the revamped coalition.</p>
<p>Leading Welfare deputy Oguzhan Asilturk, a close aide to Erbakan, warned that the post of prime minister would not be handed over unless the BBP joined the coalition.</p>
<p>&quot;If the BBP does not join the government the prime ministership cannot be handed over,&quot; Asilturk was quoted as telling reporters by Anatolian.</p>
<p>The BBP, with eight deputies, could hold the balance of power in any vote of confidence in a caretaker government or a planned opposition censure motion against the current coalition. It reached parliament in 1995 in alliance with a larger party.</p>
<p>The government, under intense pressure from the secularist army, lost its absolute majority in parliament last week.</p>
