<p>Massachusetts Gov William Weld on Wednesday proposed a $2.9 billion capital program in fiscal year 1998, according to his budget recommendations.</p>
<p>The governor also recommended that $200 million of general obligation bonds and Massachusetts Land Bank bonds be issued to pay for converting Fort Devens, located about 50 miles west of Boston in Havard, Ayer, and Shirley, to a civilian complex.  </p>
<p>Weld noted that from 1995 to 1996, a total of $5.7 billion of bonds were approved. However, not all of these bond were issued as the state is subject to a cap.</p>
<p>The budget documents noted &quot;The plan limits capital spending to an average of $900 million per year on a rolling five-year basis, which is intended to limit the growth in Commonwealth outstanding debt to two percent in any given period.&quot;</p>
<p>The capital plan also includes $125 million to maintain and repair the Commonwealth's buildings, and a $583 program for renovating and acquiring courthouses. No details on how these plans would be funded were immediately available.</p>
<p>And while the program also calls for upgrading transportation upgrades and remediating environmental hazards, no amounts were immediately available.</p>
