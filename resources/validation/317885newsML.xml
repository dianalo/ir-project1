<headline>U.S. high-yield debt trade thin but for Trump.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. high-yield bonds were largely unchanged in thin trade on Monday with the notable exception of powerful gains in Trump-related debt, dealers and traders said.</p>
<p>Investment-grade trade was non-existent, meanwhile, with the U.S. Treasury market closed in observance of the Martin Luther King Day holiday.  </p>
<p>High-yield traders reported an early flurry of transactions surrounding Trump Castle and Trump Atlantic City debt after Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts Inc said it signed a letter of intent to form a partnership with real estate investment firm Colony Capital Inc. That partnership would result in a $125 million equity infusion into Trump by Colony through a purchase of a 51 percent equity interest.</p>
<p>News of the deal sent Trump Castle's debt up 14 points at its peak before settling at 93 for an 11 point gain. Trump's Atlantic City Funding notes about three points to 96 bid.  </p>
<p>Trump plans to execute the deal by May 1, President and Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Ribis told Reuters on Monday.</p>
<p>One high-yield issue priced on Monday. Esat Holdings Limited sold approximately $85 million (proceeds) of 10-year senior deferred coupon notes in the private placement market for a yield to maturity of 12.50 percent. The issue has a five-year zero coupon and was priced at 54.411 via lead manager Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.</p>
<p>The deal has a three-year equity call for 33-1/3 percent at par plus the coupon. It also included warrants for three percent of the company.  </p>
<p>Back in investment grades, sources expect spread tightening on Tuesday for debt of First USA Inc in response to Banc One Corp's $7.3 billion bid for the company on Monday.</p>
<p>First USA notes are currently rated Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB-minus by Standard &amp; Poors. Banc One notes are rated A1 and A-plus by the two rating agencies, respectively.</p>
