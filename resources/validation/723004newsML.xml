<headline>Mexico stocks break record streak on profit-taking.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-07-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks ended down for the first time in nine sessions Friday as dealers decided to take profits in a quiet session, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market saw profit-taking today, and sought to consolidate recent gains,&quot; said Hector Jimenez, an analyst at the Inverlat brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;This could be the beginning of the breather we've all been expecting. Today, however, investors were not bailing out, just selling moderately.&quot;</p>
<p>The blue-chip IPC index closed down 40.77 points, or 0.84 percent, at 4,821.62.</p>
<p>Trading volume was the lightest of the week at 87.7 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing much happened, it was just a normal retreat after the market shot through two resistances like they weren't there,&quot; a desk trader said. &quot;We saw no earth-shaking economic or corporate news today.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the most heavily traded decliners read like a roll call of stocks that led the recent rally, and was headed by Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) and financial company Bancomer.    Bancomer B shares fell 19 centavos (2.5 cents) to 4.19</p>
<p>pesos (53 cents).</p>
<p>Telmex shed 25 centavos (3 cents) to 21.00 pesos ($2.67). The telecommunications company's ADRs ended down 9/16 to 53-5/16 in a parallel move that shunned gains on the Dow Jones, which ended up 35.06 points at 7,921.82.</p>
<p>Vitro was one of the few blue chips that bucked the downward trend and gained 45 centavos (6 cents) to 35.20 pesos ($4.48) on what dealers said was a favourable reaction to second-quarter earnings it posted Thursday night.</p>
<p>On the broad market, decliners outnumbered gainers by 54 to 50, out of a total 115 stocks that changed hands.</p>
