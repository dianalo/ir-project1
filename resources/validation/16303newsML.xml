<p>The American diplomat in charge of elections in Bosnia on Tuesday postponed municipal polls citing alleged irregularities in Serb voter registrations, but the Serbs said they would go ahead and hold them anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;I have made a Chairman's decision that it is not feasible to hold municipal elections on September 14,&quot; said Robert Frowick, head of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission in Bosnia.</p>
<p>The OSCE is charged with supervising the elections through a mandate provided under the Dayton peace agreement.</p>
<p>Frowick said voting for cantonal assemblies, separate Moslem-Croat and Serb parliaments, a national House of Representatives and a three-man Presidency would go forward on September 14 as planned.</p>
<p>He mentioned April or May as possible future dates for the rescheduled elections.</p>
<p>But the Serbs reacted angrily and said they would ignore Frowick's decision which the separatists' news agency SRNA termed &quot;undemocratic&quot;.</p>
<p>Serb deputy prime minister Miroslav Vjestica said: &quot;The government of the Bosnian Serb republic will, in keeping with a decision by the national assembly, hold full elections -- meaning also municipal.&quot;</p>
<p>Bosnian Serb parliament speaker Momilo Krajisnik said he was &quot;very disappointed&quot; by Frowick's decision.</p>
<p>&quot;We believed Frowick was doing everything possible for the situation to be normalized and elections to be held at all levels,&quot; Krajisnik said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are concerned because one side (the Moslems) can influence Frowick into changing an already-made decision.&quot;</p>
<p>OSCE chairman-in-office, Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti, suported Frowick's move.</p>
<p>&quot;(Cotti)...believes this measure should be able to correct the consequences of the manipulations which have occurred,&quot; a statement issued by OSCE headquarters in Vienna said.</p>
<p>Frowick's decision has direct implications for the 53,000-strong NATO-led peace mission in Bosnia whose mandate is supposed to expire on December 20.</p>
<p>A significant military presence was already being planned for 1997 but will now have to be strong enough to provide general security for municipal elections when they are held.</p>
<p>NATO sources said their support for the OSCE under Dayton would continue until December 20 but refused to speculate what might happen beyond that.</p>
<p>The OSCE's Provisional Election Commission (PEC) -- its top rule-making body for the elections -- had been wrestling with the issue of what to do about municipal elections for a week.</p>
<p>More than 640,000 refugees who registered to vote in 55 countries around the world are scheduled to begin casting absentee ballots on Wednesday, August 28.</p>
<p>Frowick said the PEC, which includes Bosnian Moslem, Serb and Croat members, was unable to reach agreement and that he, as its Chairman, had made the final decision.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no unanimity so I had to make a Chairman's decision,&quot; Frowick told reporters.</p>
<p>Even before the Serbs had reacted Frowick said their decision to press ahead with municipal polls was of dubious legality and would further complicate an already fraught political environment.</p>
<p>International election monitors have charged that authorities actively discouraged Bosnian Serb refugees in Serbia from registering to vote from their pre-war homes.</p>
<p>Instead, monitors report, the refugees were pressured to register to vote in towns which once had Moslem majorities but which are now underpopulated because the Moslems were killed or expelled during the war.</p>
<p>Diplomats say the Serb aim in this electoral engineering is to secure permanent control of strategically important towns inside that 49 percent of Bosnia know as the Serb republic, consolidating through the ballot box what they seized in war.</p>
<p>Such a manoeuvre would flip the Dayton peace process on its head by turning elections into a vehicle for the country's permanent ethnic division rather than its reintegration as a multi-ethnic state.</p>
