<title>SWEDEN: Swedish stocks close at record highs.</title>
<headline>Swedish stocks close at record highs.</headline>

<p>Swedish shares ended at record highs on Tuesday after the market turned upwards along with New York as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan calmed markets by saying current U.S. inflation was low.</p>
<p>The general index rose 0.13 percent to a record high of 2,482.16 in turnover of 4.7 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical shares were in focus with Astra riding on a media report saying it is successfully developing a painkiller which could give it annual sales of $1 billion in ten years. The share rose 3.5 crowns to 324.</p>
<p>Competitor Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn dropped six crowns to 267.</p>
<p>Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn continued to suffer after CEO John Zabriskie said on Monday that he would resign immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;The fall is understandable, but it is an overreaction,&quot; said Franc Gregori, analyst at BZW.</p>
<p>&quot;If no foul play is behind Zabriskie's resignation, the share price fall will prove to be a buying opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>Telecommunications group Ericsson kept going strong, partly supported by winning a 3.5 billion crown order in Mexico. The share rose two crowns to 243, after jumping 4.5 on Monday.</p>
