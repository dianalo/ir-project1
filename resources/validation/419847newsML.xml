<p>The United States on Tuesday welcomed what it called a Japanese commitment not to export its way out of its economic troubles, but Tokyo quickly countered that it had made no such pledge.</p>
<p>U.S. Deputy Secretary Lawrence Summers, repeating what is fast becoming Washington's standard line on Japan's economy, urged Tokyo to make sure its recovery was led by domestic growth and that its trade surplus did not surge.</p>
<p>Summers, in Tokyo for a meeting of finance and central bank officials from five Asian economies and the United States, said he gave that message to Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka in talks on Tuesday and that Mitsuzuka had promised to do what needed to be done.</p>
<p>&quot;In our conversation, Minister of Finance Mitsuzuka made it clear that the Japanese government shared these objectives and he committed to take measures as necessary to ensure a strong domestic demand-led recovery and avoid a significant increase in external imbalances,&quot; Summers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome this commitment,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Summers said fulfilling that &quot;commitment&quot; might require fresh fiscal and financial system steps as well as more structural reforms, depending on &quot;how economic events played out&quot;. But he declined to prescribe specific remedies.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have become particularly worried that Tokyo's plans to reduce its budget deficit, including a rise in its sales tax in April, could further undermine growth.</p>
<p>&quot;I discussed the fact that there was a range of uncertainty about how the Japanese economy would behave over the next year and that from the American perspective it was very important that Japan made its commitment to strong domestic demand-led growth -- a commitment I was very glad that the finance minister reaffirmed today,&quot; Summers said.</p>
<p>Summers also urged Japan to move fast to clean up its banking sector's bad loan woes but sidestepped the touchy topic of whether Tokyo should use taxpayers money to do so.</p>
<p>&quot;When the problems are allowed to fester they cast a shadow over subsequent economic growth and run the risk of expanding as the financial tumour spreads,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Senior finance ministry officials, meanwhile, said Japan would stick to its policy of ensuring a domestic demand-led recovery and insisted Washington need not fear that Japan's trade surplus was set to balloon after halving since 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;Our policy has been to ensure a recovery led by domestic demand,&quot; Eisuke Sakakibara, director-general of the ministry's international finance bureau, told a news conference. &quot;There is no change in our position.&quot;</p>
<p>But he begged to differ on the issue of whether Japan had &quot;committed&quot; itself to anything. &quot;First of all, I think words such as 'assurance' and 'commitment' are too strong. The situation is not like that.&quot;</p>
<p>Sakakibara said Mitsuzuka had explained to Summers that Japan's trade surplus was unlikely to bulge precipitously and that Japan wanted to achieve growth led by domestic demand.</p>
<p>U.S.-Japan trade friction was on the back burner for much of last year, but economists say it may flare again if Japan's trade surplus surges due to the weak yen.</p>
