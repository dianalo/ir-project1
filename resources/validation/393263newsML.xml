<headline>SOCCER-NANTES CLIMB TO FIFTH WITH 1-0 WIN AT RENNES.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-02-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Nantes extended their unbeaten run in the French first division to 20 matches on Friday with a 1-0 win that ended Rennes' 12-match sequence without a home defeat.</p>
<p>Striker Jocelyn Gourvennec scored in the 69th minute, his ninth goal of the season, from a pass from the left by Japhet N'Doram as Nantes, champions two years ago, climbed to fifth in the standings.</p>
<p>Nantes' steady rise after a dismal start to the season is due in part to the fine form of their teenage goalkeeper Mickael Landreau, now unbeaten in his 18 first division games.</p>
<p>Landreau made a crucial save from a header by Rennes captain Patrice Carteron in the first half.</p>
<p>He was lucky when, in the 63rd minute, Rennes' Scottish striker Alan Johston put the ball wide from a cross from the left by Stephane Guivarc'h, the leading marksman in the first division who has scored 17 of his team's 30 goals.</p>
<p>Lyon were held 0-0 at home by Lens, whose point lifted them two places to 14th, at least for 24 hours until Saturday's eight matches.</p>
<p>Substitute Tony Vairelles hit the bar for Lens, while Lyon's Polish defender Jasek Bak had a goal disallowed when he turned the ball into the Lens net with his fist.</p>
<p>Monaco defend their seven-point lead at the top of the table away to Metz.</p>
