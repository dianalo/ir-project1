<headline>Jakarta shares end higher, quake causes stir.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-03-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Jakarta share prices closed higher on Monday on sustained buying interest, while a strong earthquake that hit the city in the afternoon caused some traders to flee the stock exchange building, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the traders left the building after being told to leave,&quot; one broker said. &quot;The exchange itself was not closed.&quot;</p>
<p>The Jakarta Composite Index closed 4.09 points, or 0.61 percent higher, at 670.94 points. In the broader market, gainers led losers 81 to 44, with 52 counters unchanged.</p>
<p>Total turnover was some 265 billion rupiah on a volume of 101.4 million shares.  </p>
<p>The earthquake, which measured 6.0 on the open-ended Richter scale, was centred 33 km below the sea-bed in the Indian Ocean, some 300 km southeast of Jakarta. There were no reports of casualties or damage, but hundreds of employees scurried out of high-rise buildings onto the streets.</p>
<p>Blue-chip Bank International Indonesia (BII) topped the active list, with 10.5 million shares changing hands. It rose 75 rupiah to close at 1,825 rupiah, but was off its day-high of 1,850 rupiah. First-tier Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) rose 25 rupiah to 1,400, but was also off its day-high of 1,425 rupiah. Volume was some 10 million shares.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was profit-taking in both BII and BNI because investors feel the market is still weak,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors are looking to cash out and were mostly net sellers today,&quot; he said. &quot;Local investors were mainly speculative, and only in the market for the day.&quot;</p>
<p>Second-liner fisheries firm Daya Guna Samudera rose 300 rupiah to 3,700 rupiah on what brokers said was market talk of its good 1996 financial results. It was placed third on the active list, with some eight million shares changing hands.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been hearing that its results were good,&quot; one broker said. &quot;Some have been saying it had good fundamentals.&quot;  </p>
<p>Transporation company Steady Safe rose 200 rupiah to 2,775 rupiah on a volume of 841,500 shares on what brokers said was market talk that it was planning a merger.</p>
<p>&quot;The talk is that Steady Safe is planning a merger, but it was not clear with whom,&quot; one broker said. Company officials could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>Blue-chip Telekom was down 75 rupiah to 3,825 rupiah on what brokers said was foreign selling.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors were selling because they wanted to cash out of Telkom,&quot; one broker said.</p>
