<p>Sweden's stockmarket ended the week at a record high on Friday as a volley of good news prompted analysts to say that market fundamentals were strong enough to keep shares buoyant.</p>
<p>Falling interest rates, lower-than-expected inflation, a well received Nordbanken share buyback, and positive economic data from the U.S. and Germany were all cited as factors contributing to the market's upbeat tone.</p>
<p>&quot;Stronger growth and low inflation are just what a stock exchange needs,&quot; Nordbanken analyst Paul Hansson told Reuters.</p>
<p>After three record highs in the past week, the general index climbed further on Friday, rising 1.25 percent to a record 2,057.65. Shares worth 4.9 billion crowns ($734 million) changed hands amid strong activity.</p>
<p>The general index closed at 2,000.21 last Friday, having started the year at 1,736.83.</p>
<p>&quot;The sharemarket looks quite strong and I think it could continue for a while,&quot; Swedbank analyst Mats Liss said. &quot;There's no reason for it to turn down in any drastic way in the short-term.&quot;</p>
<p>The market was given a boost when Statistics Sweden on Thursday announced consumer prices fell 0.4 percent in August, making annualised inflation 0.3 percent, the lowest since 1959. The market had expected August's CPI to be flat.</p>
<p>&quot;If anyone had any reason to fear the bond market, these figures showing almost zero inflation would have made any worries disappear,&quot; Matteus analyst Bjorn Germer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason the market is going up is that people have been surprised by the strength in the market but it is now extremely interest rate sensitive and will closely watch bond markets.&quot;</p>
<p>Swedish interest rates have been falling steadily this year. On Tuesday the central bank, the Riksbank, cut its key repo rate, the central rate of its three tier system, for the 19th time this year, trimming another 0.1 percentage points to take it to 5.15 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rate developments will be the key influence on the market now and the market will be closely monitoring the next Fed meeting and looking for any other sign of strength in the cyclical upturn,&quot; said Hansson.</p>
<p>&quot;But the fundamentals are good with inflation lower than expected and hopes of a stronger growth upturn greater than a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;We have passed an important technical level this week and maybe we will continue up a few ticks now or come back for a consolidation and then continue up again.&quot;</p>
<p>In company news this week, Nordbanken shares rose strongly on news of a five billion crowns share buy back that will boost earnings per share and could reduce the government's stake in the bank to 58 percent from 65.5 percent.</p>
<p>Nordbanken closed the week at 155 crowns from 135.50 crowns before the announcement.</p>
<p>On Friday investment stocks saw strong gains on news the government planned to make tax changes which would reduce the tax investment companies had to pay if they split up.</p>
<p>Another winner during the week was car safety equipment maker Autoliv which signed a side airbag contract with Volkswagen.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything's going the right way on the bourse, liquidity is vast, and not much looks like going wrong,&quot; Hansson said. ($1=6.68 crowns)</p>
