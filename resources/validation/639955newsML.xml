<p>Malaysia's pepper market looks bullish in the near term, with a lower crop in the current year lending support to prices, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>White pepper out of the east Malaysian state of Sarawak -- the country's main pepper producing area -- was quoted between $5,100 and $5,200 a tonne in the New York market for July/August shipment, lower than the high of $5,842 at the end of March.</p>
<p>But black pepper from Sarawak was trading at around $3,900 a tonne in New York for July/August, compared to $3,483 at end-March, traders said.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, Sarawak black pepper was fetching around 7,000 ringgit a tonne for July/August, compared to 6,660 ringgit between January and March, traders said.</p>
<p>They said white pepper from Sarawak was quoted at around 1,100 ringgit for July/August, compared to a high of 1,178 ringgit in the first quarter of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, the market is strong on the fundamental side,&quot; said a spokesman for the Pepper Marketing Board in Sarawak. &quot;We're seeing a good run now for black pepper compared to white, but that's only a matter of preference.&quot;</p>
<p>Malaysian prices will be supported this year by a lower production of around 12,000 to 15,000 tonnes of pepper, compared to 20,239 tonnes in 1996, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Growers expect production to decline because there has been more rain than last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The export figures may, however, vary as stocks that are held for more than a year are sometimes released into the market,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The pepper board said production in the first quarter of 1997 was 5,493 tonnes.</p>
<p>Malaysia is among the world's top five pepper producers, along with India, Indonesia, Vietnam and Brazil.</p>
