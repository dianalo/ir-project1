<p>Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram may address the lower house of parliament on Friday about the government's proposed 1996/97 (April-March) budget, a ministry official said.</p>
<p>His remarks would be part of a two-stage response to reports that standing committees from both houses of parliament have prepared this month on the budget, which Chidambaram presented to lawmakers in July.</p>
<p>The finance minister will first offer a general reply, perhaps early on Friday afternoon, to the parliamentary reports.</p>
<p>It would not be known before late Thursday afternoon whether Chidambaram would make his remarks on Friday or at a later date, the official said.</p>
<p>He plans to make a more detailed reply on the finance bill, including offering any amendments to tax proposals, next month, probably on September 9 or 10, the official said.</p>
<p>The budget is expected to come to a vote in parliament by September 13, when the current session is set to end.</p>
<p>Newspapers have said Chidambaram is considering exempting certain sectors from the proposed minimum alternate tax (MAT) on corporations which was proposed in the budget.</p>
<p>The Economic Times said on Thursday that the finance minister &quot;has virtually made up his mind to grant tax relief to the steel industry&quot;.</p>
<p>Finance Ministry officials declined to comment on the report.</p>
