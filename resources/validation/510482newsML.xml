<p>U.S. drug officials have arrested a senior Pakistan Air Force (PAF) officer in New York for allegedly carrying heroin in a PAF Boeing 707, a military statement said on Monday.</p>
<p>The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations Department did not give the date of the arrest of Squadron Leader Mohammad Farooq or state the purpose of the plane's trip to the United States.</p>
<p>However, a local vernacular newspaper, Khabrain, said the officer was arrested three days ago and that he had been due to bring to Pakistan spare parts for U.S.- made F-16 fighters.</p>
<p>The statement said Farooq was arrested for possessing about two kg (4.4 pounds) of heroin and that the arrest was &quot;the result of a proactive programme started by PAF to combat the rapidly increasing spectre of drug trafficking&quot;.</p>
<p>It said the plane was returning to Pakistan on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chief of the Air Staff (Air Chief Marshal Abbas Khattak) has ordered an immediate high-level inquiry into this shameful act since it is not only a breach of law but also undermines military discipline and morale,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Disciplinary action as well as other measures to preclude recurrence of such offences are being further enforced,&quot; it added.</p>
