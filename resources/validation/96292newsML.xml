<headline>Mexico stocks end up slightly, late profit-taking.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks closed modestly higher Friday after profit-taking cut into earlier gains, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a bout of normal profit-taking towards the close. Foreigners, although less enthusiastic, were still drawn by low prices,&quot; said an equity analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;The bolsa was boosted by the Dow rally. It has the strength to gain more next week, when third quarter earningss reports are discounted,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The blue chip IPC index closed up just 2.7 points, or 0.08 percent, at 3,376.05, down from a session high of 3,396.66.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones meanwhile closed up 60.01 points, or 1.01 percent, at a record 5,992.86.</p>
<p>After profit-taking, most stocks left on the gainers list were infrequently traded. Bank stock Intenal headed the list after just 7,000 shares traded, gaining 66 centavos (9 cents) to 7.14 pesos (98 cents).</p>
<p>Pulp and paper stock Ponder, in fifth place after gaining 18 centavos (2 cents) to 4.15 pesos (55 cents), was traded at more reasonable volume due to a favourable outlook for its forthcoming earnings report.</p>
<p>On the broad market, 109 stocks changed hands, of which winners outnumbered losers 52 to 30, with 27 unchanged.</p>
<p>Another early gainer was truck and bus maker Dina, which closed up 16 centavos (2 cents) at 5.10 pesos (68 cents), after reports that it had refinanced debt held by its U.S. subsidiary.</p>
<p>Technical analysts meanwhile said that the market trend was towards resistance at 3,400 points in the coming sessions.</p>
<p>&quot;Reaching 3,400 points will be easy. After that the technical objective is at 3,570 points,&quot; a technical analyst said.</p>
