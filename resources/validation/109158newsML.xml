<p>Israeli President Ezer Weizman announced plans on Thursday to visit Jordan, amid growing signs that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hardline policies are alienating the Jewish state's closest Arab friend.</p>
<p>The news came as Israeli media was dominated by talk of a crisis in relations with Jordan's King Hussein, the only Arab leader who had not expressed alarm when Netanyahu was elected last May.</p>
<p>&quot;He was invited long ago,&quot; a presidential spokeswoman said about Weizman's visit to Jordan. &quot;The visit will probably come about in the next week or two.&quot;</p>
<p>King Hussein has become outspokenly critical of Netanyahu since the Israeli leader opened a new entrance to a tunnel near Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem's Old City last month, triggering violence that killed 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis.</p>
<p>The Israeli move angered the king's largely Palestinian population and appeared to ignore his &quot;special role&quot; in the 1994 Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty over Islamic sites in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Weizman has used his largely ceremonial position to take on a central role in regional diplomacy as Netanyahu's relations with Arab countries deteriorate.</p>
<p>This week he met Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, an encounter first announced two months ago when Netanyahu was refusing to see the Palestinian leader. Next Monday he is to visit Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who also has poor relations with Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Weizman, asked on Army radio about a newspaper report that Netanyahu's office was angry at his forays into foreign policy, said: &quot;No criticism by the prime minister has been directed at me...everything I am doing is coordinated.&quot;</p>
<p>Israeli newspapers reflected the contrast between the close ties between Jordan and Israel since the peace treaty and the new criticism by Amman. Despite deep scepticism among his own people, King Hussein personally drove relations forward.</p>
<p>&quot;Of all the leaders in the region who voiced their disappointment in Benjamin Netanyahu since May, the disappointment Jordan's King Hussein has expressed is of special significance,&quot; said an editorial in the daily newspaper Haaretz that accused the government of weakening the Jordanian leader.</p>
<p>But members of Netanyahu's government, which unseated the Labour-led coalition that made peace with Jordan, denied there were problems over Israeli policies.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to say that our relations with Jordan are good, strong, excellent,&quot; Foreign Minister David Levy said on Israel radio.</p>
<p>However, some cabinet ministers suggested King Hussein, leading a small Arab country with a largely Palestinian population, was bending to anti-Israeli pressure that he should resist.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai rejected the king's criticism: &quot;There are no disputes between us and I call from here on the king to continue on the path he started and not let anyone push him from that path.&quot;</p>
<p>Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said King Hussein, who initially tried to moderate Arab criticism of Netanyahu, had &quot;joined the big celebration&quot; against Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;They're like vultures attacking a person who's in a weak position in order to devour him,&quot; Kahalani said of Arab critics. &quot;I don't get excited over these things. Israel has to be strong at this moment. King Hussein doesn't concern me.&quot;</p>
