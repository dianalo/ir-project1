<headline>Miss. highest court rules against tobacco industry.</headline>

<p>By Gail Appleson, Law Correspondent</p>
<p>In a blow to the tobacco industry, Mississippi's highest court on Thursday ruled that the first state Medicaid suit seeking to recoup health care costs of smokers can go to trial.</p>
<p>The Mississippi Supreme Court threw out challenges by Gov. Kirk Fordice and the tobacco industry that would have kept the $940 million case from proceeding to trial on June 2.</p>
<p>Wall Street reacted to the ruling by driving the stocks of tobacco companies sharply lower, contributing to a 160-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average. Dow component Philip Morris Cos. plunged $10.75 to $126 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Mississippi became the first state to file a Medicaid suit on May 23, 1994. Since that time, another 21 attorneys general and the lieutenant governor of Alabama have filed similar suits.</p>
<p>&quot;They've given us the green light to go to trial. It is the best we could have hoped for,&quot; Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore, who filed the suit, told Reuters in a telephone interview. &quot;They threw the governor out of court. They threw the tobacco companies out of court.&quot;</p>
<p>Fordice, a Republican, challenged the suit claiming that only he had the authority to bring lawsuits to recover Medicaid money since the state's division of Medicaid is under the control of his office.</p>
<p>Moore, a Democrat, had filed the case without obtaining Fordice's approval. He frequently tells the story that the governor was greatly angered by the action and told Moore that the suit made him want to &quot;throw up.&quot;</p>
<p>If the court had ruled in Fordice's favor, Moore's lawsuit would have been limited to claims on behalf of charity hospital spending and the prohibition of cigarette advertising aimed at children.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs lawyers said the ruling was both a psychological and legal victory for many of the state attorneys general who have followed Moore's lead in suing the tobacco industry to recoup health care costs of smokers.</p>
<p>The industry has challenged many of the suits on grounds that the attorneys general do not have the authority to bring them, said Jim Tierney, a former Maine attorney general who is coordinating the litigation by the attorneys general.</p>
<p>However, he said that many states have laws that are similar to Mississippi's that give authority to attorneys general to bring suit independent of governors, legislators and state regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a clear message to those states that their attorneys general have this power,&quot; Tierney said.</p>
<p>The ruling comes at a time of great speculation over the possibility that the once-invincible industry might agree to some type of massive settlement to end mounting litigation against it.</p>
<p>Although legal experts believe any possible deal may be a long time away, the Mississippi ruling is expected to fuel such speculation.</p>
<p>As recently as Wednesday, sources told Reuters that talks aimed at a broader settlement between Liggett Group Inc. and some attorneys general have intensified and a deal could be reached in the next few weeks. Liggett, the smallest of the nation's cigarette companies, is owned by Bennett LeBow's Brooke Group Inc.</p>
<p>The talks, which involve Liggett's proposal to turn over highly sensitive industry documents, have picked up ahead of the first anniversary of Liggett's break with the industry to become the first cigarette maker to settle smoking litigation.</p>
<p>On March 13, 1996, Liggett agreed to settle a federal class-action lawsuit in New Orleans and two days later reached an accord with five states that had sued the industry to recoup the costs of providing health care for poor smokers.</p>
