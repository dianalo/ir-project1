<p>A federal jury awarded $1,402 in compensatory damages to Food Lion Inc. Monday in its finding that ABC television reporters committed fraud in preparing an undercover report about alleged unsanitary food practices at the grocery chain.</p>
<p>The jury deliberated for one hour before awarding Food Lion $1,400 on the fraud allegation, $1 for trespassing and $1 for breach of loyalty. The company had claimed damages of $2,432.35 in this phase of the proceeding.</p>
<p>Food Lion sued ABC and four producers, seeking $1.7 billion in damages to recoup losses it says it suffered as a result of an expose the network aired in 1992 about the food retailer on its &quot;PrimeTime Live&quot; news magazine show.</p>
<p>The jury, which will hear evidence on punitive damages later this week, ruled on Dec. 20 that journalists employed by ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co., committed trespassing and fraud in preparing the undercover report about Food Lion, which is based in Salisbury, N.C.</p>
<p>The panel said that two field producers and two executive producers of ABC committed the offences while preparing a report about Food Lion for broadcast on Nov. 5, 1992.</p>
<p>Food Lion, a unit of Belgian retailer Ets Delhaize Freres et Cie &quot;LE LION&quot; SA, claimed it lost $1.5 billion in stock value at the time of the broadcast and $233 million in profits after the broadcast.</p>
<p>But in a ruling issued moments after the Dec. 20 jury verdict, U.S. District Judge N. Carlton Tilley said Food Lion could not seek damages for lost sales or diminished stock value from the broadcast.</p>
<p>He said the company would be limited to seeking damages in the form of wages paid to the ABC employees, the cost of hiring replacements and punitive damages.</p>
<p>During the trial, Food Lion accused ABC of fraud and deception for having its producers apply for jobs at the grocer's stores without admitting they were working for the network.</p>
<p>ABC denied its producers had committed fraud but did not contest allegations they had practiced deception.</p>
<p>The producers were in the Food Lion stores for about three weeks, wearing small cameras in wigs and recorders under their smocks. They took 34 hidden camera tapes, which amounted to 45 hours.</p>
<p>Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for ABC News, said the network would have no comment until the trial ended. Officials for Food Lion were not immediately available for comment.</p>
