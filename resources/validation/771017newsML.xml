<p>September notionnel futures on MATIF will remain steady on Thursday, but the longer-term trend is positive, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The contract is basically consolidative, within the core of its uptrend,&quot; said Elli Gifford, independent technical analyst near Cambridge.</p>
<p>Gifford put resistance around the contract high of 131.24 reached on daily charts on July 23. Before that, resistance kicked in at 131.20, she said.</p>
<p>September notionnel futures were trading at 130.92 at 0708 GMT, down 0.04.  </p>
<p>Jim Dodgin, senior technical analyst at Technical Data in London, saw the contract stuck in a 130.90-131.10 range on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot really see too much happening before the non-farm payrolls on Friday. There is a slight bias to the upside, but it is capped by the contract high.&quot;</p>
<p>On the downside, Dodgin found rising trendline support at 130.70. &quot;Unless that breaks, there is no point being short.&quot;</p>
<p>Gifford saw support at 130.60, and below there at 130.40. The contract hit a high of 130.60 on Monday on daily charts, and reached a low of 130.40 in the same session.  </p>
<p>&quot;You cannot really see a lot of activity. The notionnel has a bit of a similar picture to the Bund, but I prefer the Bund,&quot; said Gifford.</p>
<p>At the short end, September PIBOR futures were unchanged on the day at 96.52.</p>
