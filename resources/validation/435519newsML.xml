<p>Barcelona clinched a place in the semi-finals of the Spanish Cup on Wednesday after coming back from 3-0 down to beat Atletico Madrid 5-4 in one of the most extraordinary games played in Spain for years.</p>
<p>Milinko Pantic scored all four goals for Atletico but still ended up on the losing side in this second leg encounter which finally tipped Barcelona's way 7-6 on aggregate when Juan Pizzi scored the final goal of the night after 82 minutes.</p>
<p>Atletico had only decided to play the game after abandoning their threat to withdraw from the competition in protest at the suspension of three players. They took the decision to play barely an hour and a half before the scheduled kickoff.</p>
<p>But with their pride at stake Atletico stormed into a 3-0 lead in just 31 minutes thanks to Pantic -- who has had a quiet season after scoring the winner against Barcelona in last year's Cup final.</p>
<p>The Serbian knocked in the first after just eight minutes when Barcelona keeper Vitor Baia failed to hold a shot from the edge of the area by Carlos Aguilera.</p>
<p>Pantic made it two just before the half-hour when he beat Baia at the near post with a long-range shot, and moments later he converted a penalty after defender Laurent Blanc brought down Kiko in the area.</p>
<p>Barcelona's English coach Bobby Robson substituted Blanc and midfielder Gheorghe Popescu and brought on forwards Hristo Stoichkov and Pizzi in the closing minutes of the first half.</p>
<p>The change brought fruit straight after the break when Ronaldo cracked home a volley from the edge of the penalty area, and three minutes later Ivan de la Pena gave the home fans some hope after finishing off a break down the left.</p>
<p>But an inspired Pantic seemed to kill off the tie in the 53rd minute by making it 4-2, with Baia again at fault.</p>
<p>Luis Figo volleyed home a superb strike from outside the area with 20 minutes on the clock to make it 3-4, and Ronaldo equalised shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>There was pandemonium when Pizzi knocked in a loose ball eight minutes from time, and jubilation overtook Barcelona fans who had whistled Baia and shouted insults towards club president Jose Luis Nunez.</p>
<p>Earlier in the evening another Barcelona-based side, Espanyol, were knocked out of the Cup by Las Palmas of the second division. The second leg finished 1-1 after a goalless draw in the first leg, and the Canary Islanders took the tie on the away goals rule.</p>
<p>The quarter finals continue on Thursday when Real Betis take a 2-0 lead from the first leg to Rayo Vallecano, and Celta Vigo defend a 2-1 lead at home to Racing Santander.</p>
