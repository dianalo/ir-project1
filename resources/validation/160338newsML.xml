<p>Indian authorities arrested two former chairmen of cigarette company ITC Ltd on Friday in a widening investigation into alleged foreign exchange violations, a senior government official said.</p>
<p>K.K. Kabirpanthi, deputy director of the eastern regional office of the Enforcement Directorate, said former chairmen K.L. Chugh and J.N. Sapru were arrested early on Friday and put in police custody in the eastern city of Calcutta.</p>
<p>&quot;We have arrested them and handed them over to police,&quot; Kabirpanthi told reporters outside the Enforcement Directorate's offices.</p>
<p>&quot;They will be produced before a local court on Friday afternoon,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kabirpanthi said both Chugh and Sapru were charged with violating the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA).</p>
<p>On Wednesday the Enforcement Directorate arrested a director and three former officials of ITC for allegedly violating FERA.</p>
<p>The directorate, the watchdog over issues related to corporate finances, arrested the four during early morning searches on Wednesday of offices and homes in Calcutta, Bombay, Hyderabad and New Delhi.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that the search operations were undertaken &quot;only after sufficient evidence had been collected indicating FERA violations by ITC Ltd to the tune of over $100 million&quot;.</p>
<p>ITC officials could not be reached for comment on the arrest of Chugh and Sapru. ITC has not yet commented publicly on the investigation.</p>
<p>Britain's B.A.T Industries Plc has a 31.7 percent stake in ITC. The rest of its shares are held by Indian financial institutions and the public.</p>
