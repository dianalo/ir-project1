<title>BELGIUM: Nerves take steam from Brussels bourse rally.</title>
<headline>Nerves take steam from Brussels bourse rally.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-05-06</dateline>

<p>The Brussels stock market, which at one stage on Tuesday accelerated to a new life high, ended with light loses after an onset of nerves due to the end of the account on Wednesday and the holiday on Thursday.</p>
<p>But traders said the market was mostly comfortable at these high levels and, baring unforseen events, looked likely to move higher again next week.</p>
<p>&quot;The new life high was perhaps a bit too enthusiatic. But I see no problem at these levels,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>However, traders warned that volatility was likely to be the rule for the rest of the week due to thin volumes.</p>
<p>Not only does the account end on Wednesday and the market is closed on Thursday for Ascension Day, but many people will also be bridging Friday for the second four-day weekend in a row.</p>
<p>&quot;Volumes will be thin because of all this, and the market is always more volatile when there are few people at their trading desks,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>However, traders said that the despite this and the fact that a number of stocks go ex-dividend on Friday -- an event that usually pushes prices down -- the underlying market sentiment remained strongly positive.</p>
<p>The Bel-20 blue chip share index ended Tuesday down 1.00 points or 0.04 percent at 2,253.87 after earlier setting a new life high of 2,271.54.</p>
<p>Traders said the index was held back through the day by heavy hedge fund selling on the futures market.</p>
<p>Star performer outside the index was fast food retailer Quick, which ended 75 francs higher at 1,875.</p>
<p>Traders said it was due mainly to a brokerage upgrading the share to hold from sell which refocused attention on a stock that has underperformed the market recently and led to a technical correction upwards.</p>
<p>Inside the index, Generale Bank was 50 francs up at 3,300, financial holding firm GBL climbed 80 francs to 5,370, shipper CMB rose 30 francs to 2,590 and electronics firm Barco was 50 francs higher at 6,200 francs.</p>
