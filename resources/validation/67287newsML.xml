<p>The head of the OSCE mission in Bosnia urged hardline Serbs on Friday to accept Bosnia's Moslem leader as head of the country's newly-elected collective presidency for his full two-year term.</p>
<p>Alija Izetbegovic has emerged as head of Bosnia's three-member presidency after receiving most votes in the country's first postwar elections on Saturday. He will share the leadership with Momcilo Krajisnik of the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croat candidate Kresimir Zubak.</p>
<p>Krajisnik earlier this week rejected a ruling by international election observers that Izetbegovic should serve a two-year term as chairman.</p>
<p>Robert Frowick, head of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission which supervised the elections, told a news conference that Kraijsnik's position was clearly outside the election's ground rules.</p>
<p>&quot;It's clear in the constitution that whoever wins the highest number of votes will be the president of the presidency,&quot; he said after briefing the OSCE's Vienna-based permanent council.</p>
<p>According to the OSCE's count, Izetbegovic received almost 730,000 votes, leading Krajisnik by about 40,000 votes.</p>
<p>Frowick's remarks mirrored those of Western diplomats on the ground who have said the hardline separatist had no choice but to cooperate in a new power-sharing arrangement designed to reintegrate Bosnia after 43 months of war.</p>
<p>Frowick appealed to the international community to push Bosnia's ethnic factions to ensure their new government works.</p>
<p>&quot;The key will be a profound commitment by the international community both militarily and in the civilian area,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 60,000-strong NATO-led peace force in Bosnia was scheduled to withdraw by the end of the year, but NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana this week said the alliance would have to remain in Bosnia beyond its mandate.</p>
<p>The military alliance's top soldier, U.S. Army General George Joulwan, has said Bosnia's municipal elections later this year could slow the withdrawal of troops, but insisted they would be out within weeks after a December 20 deadline set by the Dayton peace agreement.</p>
<p>Frowick reiterated the municipal polls, which were postponed last month because of irregularities with voter registration, might be held in the second half of November.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't tell you a precise date yet but we're committed to the second half of November,&quot; he said.</p>
