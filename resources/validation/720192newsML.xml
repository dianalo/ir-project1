<p>The light at the end of the tunnel grew a little brighter for banks who are owed nearly 9.0 billion pounds by channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA/Plc on signs that the firm's shareholders on Thursday approved a complex debt restructuring deal.</p>
<p>One Eurotunnel source in Paris on Thursday afternoon said the company had received a &quot;crushing majority&quot; approving the deal though there was no official announcement by 1830 GMT.</p>
<p>The approval, which  means shareholders and lenders have avoided the other two even more painful solutions -- putting the company into bankruptcy or &quot;substitution&quot; whereby the banks would become the effective owners of the concession to run the tunnel.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's decision removes one major uncertainty,&quot; said one banking source, &quot;and any of the bank lenders, whether they were in the original group or are more recent, will agree that it's a positive step.&quot;</p>
<p>After recent selling of Eurotunnel debt in the secondary market, where it is priced at around 50 percent of face value, the sources said the bank group now numbers just under 200 from a previous estimate of 225.</p>
<p>This group will be asked to vote on the deal in September though it is not clear at this stage whether they will have a grand meeting to air their views.</p>
<p>Bankers said they are quietly confident that the deal will go, gaining the needed unanimous approval of banks, through mostly because, as one source put it, &quot;The other solutions are much worse.&quot;</p>
<p>The number of banks in the group has fallen because some, especially the Japanese who are under pressure to reduce their exposure to problem loans, have sold.</p>
<p>Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank and Asahi Bank, Sanwa Bank, Sakura Bank and Industrial Bank of Japan are each thought to have sold between 100 million and 150 million pounds face value of debt.</p>
<p>Bankers say that buyers of the debt have been mainly from the U.S. with hedge funds and the banks Merrill Lynch, Lazard Freres and Bankers Trust mentioned as buyers both for themselves and for clients.</p>
<p>Banking sources say the entrance of new players into the lending group can have advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>New entrants will have chosen to take on the debt while older lenders may tend to become obstructive as they harbour the old resentments that such a problematic loan can produce.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, new lenders sometimes want quick returns, so they can push for a quick solution,&quot; said one source.</p>
<p>In September, any lenders holding out will come under intense pressure from the rest of the group to accept the settlement.</p>
<p>If there were no market in the debt, lenders might hold out to be paid off at a relatively high level by the others but, with a secondary market in existence, bankers say the majority is unlikely to entertain a pay-off at higher than the prevailing market price.</p>
<p>&quot;They will just have to sell to someone who will vote in favour of the deal,&quot; said one banking source.</p>
<p>The deal approved on Thursday includes no debt forgiveness and 45 percent of loans will be repaid but not until between 2005 and 2025. Existing shareholders will see their holding fall to 54.5 percent with the banks owning the rest in return for debt.</p>
<p>The future of the deal has different scenarios depending on how the company performs. If, for example, Eurotunnel's cashflow is insufficient to service the residual debt, then it can borrow amounts which pay no interest until 2005.</p>
<p>Bankers are realistic about the future though some are sceptical that Eurotunnel's projections for revenue growth will be met.</p>
<p>&quot;Either way, this deal gives everyone more time but it could be that we have to look at things again,&quot; said one banking source. ($ = 0.593 British Pounds)</p>
