<p>The New Zealand dollar closed a touch firmer on Monday and dealers said it would carry a bid tone into overnight trade.</p>
<p>The Kiwi ended at US$0.6993/00 and at 66.72 on its Trade-Weighted Index, up slightly from its 0.6988/95 and 66.68 open.</p>
<p>&quot;It's month's end so we saw a bit of selling coming through from the corporates, but there was also good interest to buy it down around the 0.6990 area,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;It's finished up with a bit more of a positive tone.&quot;  </p>
<p>Bankers Trust dealer Phil Lindberg said it had been an uneventful day for the Kiwi, with the quarter's end coinciding with Japan's half-year end, but he expected buying interest in the Kiwi to intensify as the week progressed.</p>
<p>&quot;Expect to see some more action as we go forward in the week. I think there's probably still interest out of Japan...I think a few things have been held until the start of the second half of the year for them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dealers saw Kiwi trading a 0.6990-7010 range overnight.</p>
