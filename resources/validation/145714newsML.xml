<p>About 21 Moslem rebels were killed after their camp in the southern Philippines was overrun by government soldiers, army officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The rebel camp is located just outside the hilly Tipo-Tipo town in Basilan Island, 900 km (560 miles) south of Manila.</p>
<p>Major Valentin Edang, commanding officer of the 51st Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army, said they attacked the camp of a Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) faction after local residents reported that armed groups had been demanding money from them.</p>
<p>The rebels also tried to attack a military detachment in the area.</p>
<p>Thirteen soldiers were wounded in the attack on the camp, including Edang.</p>
<p>The armed group is being disowned by MILF leaders who are presently preparing to talk peace with the government. The main rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front, recently signed a peace agreement with the government.</p>
<p>Edang said a naval blockade had been set up around the island.</p>
