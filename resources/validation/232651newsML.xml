<p>Australian gold producers are generally not selling metal as a means of protection against further falls in gold price in Australian dollar terms, local dealers, producers and analysts told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there's any panic yet, if that's what you mean,&quot; said a gold dealer with a leading securities house which has close connections with major Australian gold producers.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously they're not happy, but what can you do?&quot; said the dealer, who asked that he not be named.  </p>
<p>The gold price facing Australian producers, in local currency terms, has fallen by about A$30.00 an ounce to A$452.00 an ounce from about A$485.00 an ounce over the past 2-1/2 weeks.</p>
<p>The main reason for this has been the rise in the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar, producers say.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have thought the current gold price would be a pretty serious concern to most (Australian) producers,&quot; Chris Lalor, director of Sons of Gwalia Ltd, told Reuters.</p>
<p>SOG was underpinned by its forward position, but each producer would face its own individual criteria, he said.  </p>
<p>But not many producers would be selling gold forward at present with all the trends going against them, Lalor said.</p>
<p>While generally agreeing that Australian producers are not selling out to protect themselves against price falls in local currency price terms, views between broking houses differ on the extent to which Australian gold producers are hedged against the current fall in price.</p>
<p>&quot;They're still under-hedged,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>But another said: &quot;Australian producers are generally well-hedged against the gold price.&quot;  </p>
<p>A dealer who advises Sons of Gwalia uses the example of this company to make the point.</p>
<p>Generally, the Australian gold sector would receive an average realised price of about A$545.00 an ounce in 1995/96, while SOG would receive about A$640.00, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the companies are very well protected,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Normandy Poseidon Ltd and SOG are seen as two of the best-hedged Australian gold producers.</p>
<p>A minority, including Newcrest Mining Ltd and Placer Pacific Ltd had closed out most of their forward programmes earlier this year, he noted.  </p>
<p>While they reaped substantial profits, the strategy would hinder them if the gold price stayed low because they would have to either buy more protection or &quot;wear&quot; the current price in the longer-term, he said.</p>
<p>Many Australian producers were selling into futures but were not realising spot prices, analysts said.</p>
<p>But South African producers were in a different position from Australian producers, one dealer said.</p>
<p>With the rand depreciation, South African producers began selling forward when they believed the currency had bottomed.  </p>
<p>Now much South African forward selling seemed to have halted with a more stabilised rand, the dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's big enough that it can take producers' forward selling. It really doesn't affect the price so much,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's more the traders ... right now there are a lot of shorts out there ... and it's still going down and seems to be in the doldrums,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Despite this, the dealer said he did not believe the market would fall much further. Cash bullion was quoted around US$368.to in afternoon trading in Asia on Tuesday.</p>
