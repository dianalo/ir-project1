<p>France's new Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou has said she will push through bills to stiffen punishment of sex crimes and reform citizenship rules.</p>
<p>In an interview with the daily Le Figaro to be published on Tuesday, Guigou, a Socialist who took office this month, indicated the two bills would be debated in the National Assembly's next session in the autumn.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has said he wants to restore the tradition of automatically granting citizenship to anyone born on French soil, which was dented by the previous conservative government.</p>
<p>The conservatives, in an effort to curb immigration, pushed through a law making it necessary for French-born children of foreign parents to formally request citizenship when they reach the age of 18.</p>
<p>Guigou said she intended to revive a bill to stiffen the punishment for sex crimes and dissemination of pornography.</p>
<p>The bill's passage through parliament was interrupted last April when conservative President Jacques Chirac called an early election, which swept the left into power.</p>
<p>The new legislation would force sex offenders to undergo treatment with the aim of preventing recidivism, and deprive them of routine prison sentence reductions.</p>
<p>Guigou said she had received a report requested by Chirac on a wider reform to guarantee judicial independence among other things.</p>
<p>She said she would make proposals after studying the report drafted by a a 21-member bipartisan commission headed by Supreme Court president Pierre Truche.</p>
<p>Guigou reiterated Jospin's commitments that the government would keep hands off all judicial probes into political sleaze, following accusations that the previous government had tried to hamper some investigations.</p>
<p>She appeared to bury plans by her conservative predecessor Jacques Toubon to stiffen anti-racist legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not intend to legislate...without being sure that one cannot do better by firmly applying existing laws,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Toubon had planned to reform the existing law which punishes racist comments only when they targeted a specific group, and had proved too vague to allow prosecution of far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen for espousing racial inequality.</p>
