<p>The dollar fell sharply against the mark Wednesday amid expectations of higher German interest rates. A report suggesting Europe's single currency might be postponed also took its toll on the U.S. currency.</p>
<p>The dollar slump started overnight when the German central bank warned of rising consumer prices, leading to fears it might raise interest rates to control inflation.</p>
<p>Higher German rates would make investments based on the mark more attractive relative to the dollar.</p>
<p>In addition, a British newspaper editorial stating that Germany and France, the architects of Europe's plan to merge its currencies into the euro, had offered to delay its 1999 debut by one year if Britain would agree to paricipate. This sent fears through currency markets.</p>
<p>The Evening Standard commentary, which reinforced earlier comments by the premier of the German state of Bavaria who spoke of a plan to delay the EMU launch, was denied by British government officials. The dollar eventually fell more than three pfennigs, dipping under 1.83 marks.</p>
<p>Sterling also fell sharply vs. the mark.</p>
<p>A postponement of European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), would benefit the mark, traders say, which would retain its position as Europe's pre-eminent currency.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems the talk in Germany is the Bundesbank will raise rates. It's just a matter of timing,&quot; said Jeffrey Yu, a senior dealer at Sanwa Bank Ltd. in New York.</p>
<p>&quot;Plus, most investors worldwide are already accepting EMU will be launched on time. However, now there is some noise coming out of the financial markets that a lot of Germans do oppose EMU and those forces are gaining some momentum. A lot of politicians are backing down on the on-time EMU,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Both Germany and France are struggling with sluggish economies and high unemployment, making the tough budget cutting required to qualify for EMU politically unpopular.</p>
<p>The dollar also came under selling pressure after the Labor Department reported that U.S. producer prices fell 0.1 percent in July, the seventh consecutive decline, and the Commerce Department said July retail sales increased only 0.6 percent. Wall Street forecast slightly stronger sales and the weaker number gives retailers less scope to raise prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar actually looked like it was leading the stock and bond markets down,&quot; said Ben Strauss, a vice president at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 32.52 points to close at 7,928.32.</p>
<p>The dollar ended at 1.8345 marks, down from 1.8630 marks at Tuesday' close. It also fell to 115.65 Japanese yen from 116.28.</p>
<p>In other trade, the dollar fell to 1.5113 Swiss francs, from 1.5263 and to Canadian $1.3929 from C$1.3935.</p>
<p>The pound rose to $1.5835 from $1.5788.</p>
