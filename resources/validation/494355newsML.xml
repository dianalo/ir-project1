<headline>FORECAST - Spain March CPI fall may prompt rate cut.</headline>

<p>The Spanish consumer price index is expected to have dipped again sharply in March, perhaps prompting the Bank of Spain to lower its official money market rate as soon as April 15, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Most recent estimates put CPI at 2.3 percent, with some as low as 2.2 or even 2.1, down from a 28-year-low of 2.5 percent in February.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll published last Friday showed a consensus for March CPI to rise 0.24 percent month-on-month for a 2.4 percent year-on-year rate, but the forecast range was wide, running from 2.1 to 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect tame data, at around 2.2 or 2.3 percent, thanks mainly to oil price declines,&quot; said Colin Warren, economist at Tokai Bank in London.</p>
<p>Energy prices should be the main factor behind a decline. This component is seen falling 0.5 percent this year versus a 0.7 percent increase in March 1996, said Carmen Hernansanz, economist at Merrill Lynch in Madrid.</p>
<p>A week ago, Spain's February producer price data boosted market optimism for the March consumer price index, coming in lower than expected at 0.5 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Economy Secretary Cristobal Montoro said March CPI would be good, as would coming months.</p>
<p>Despite an optimistic view over inflation, which is expected to continue its downtrend through April and perhaps May, analysts were not positive the Bank of Spain would move its key money market rate right after next Friday's CPI.</p>
<p>&quot;If CPI comes in as expected there's a 50 percent probability the Bank of Spain will cut the official rate. But I like more the idea that they'll wait a while,&quot; Hernansanz said.</p>
<p>Despite aggressive Bank of Spain easing since December 1995, the market had put on hold any further rate cut expectations after the reduction of 25 basis points to 5.75 percent on March 14.</p>
<p>A weaker peseta and fears of further U.S. interest rate hikes were considered the main reasons.</p>
<p>But in the last week these expectations changed again.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is reviewing its expectations, awaiting March CPI data on Friday and pricing in a possible 25 basis points cut in the official rate,&quot; said Alfredo Urrutia, economist at Societe Generale in Madrid.</p>
<p>One-year MIBOR has fallen by 25 basis points since April 2.</p>
<p>Six-month Treasury bills are expected to show falling yields for the first time since mid-February at their bi-monthly auction on Wednesday, dealers added.</p>
<p>&quot;Before, there was the feeling peripheral markets would have to put further rate cuts on hold. But in the last 10 days we changed our forecasts,&quot; said Francesco Giordano, economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in London.</p>
<p>The first repurchase operation after March CPI's release will be on April 15, but that could be too soon for a cut, despite a rebounding peseta and a likely deal for the labour market reform, analysts explained.</p>
<p>&quot;In March, the Bank of Spain proved not to be prisoner of forex movement,&quot; said Riccardo Barbieri, economist at Morgan Stanley in London, suggesting this time they could wait despite the peseta's stronger position.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't rule out a move this month..I'd say there's a 50 percent probability for a cut in April and a 100 percent one before the end of May,&quot; Barbieri said.</p>
