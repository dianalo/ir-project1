<p>The Australian share market opened at record highs on Friday, continuing its record breaking run in the wake of a seemingly unstoppable Dow and stronger base metals prices.</p>
<p>The benchmark All Ordinaries index opened 5.2 points higher at 2,501.6 and by 10.15 a.m. (2315 GMT) was at 2,505.9, up 9.5 points after hitting a record and intraday high of 2,506.5.</p>
<p>This surpassed the previous record high of 2,500.9, reached on Thursday, February 13.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dow and metals prices have given us good support,&quot; said a Sydney broker, adding that the local market's valuation was attractive value.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still cheap in relative terms and so far the same stocks as yesterday are driving it.&quot;</p>
<p>The major miners made gains early as did the big banks in initial trade with National Australia Bank leading the pack, its shares hitting a high of A$16.70 (US$12.80).</p>
<p>Results continued with Perth casino owner/operator Burswood Property Trust four cents higher at A$1.69 after its 84 percent higher first half net profit of A$25.2 million.</p>
<p>Mt Leyshon Gold Mines, part of the Normandy Mining , group lost a cent to A$2.27 in thin trade after its 13.8 percent lower first half net profit of A$9.36 million.</p>
<p>Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about eight to three, while about 41 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
