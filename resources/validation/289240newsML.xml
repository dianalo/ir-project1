<p>Norwegian observers on a mission to keep peace in the troubled town of Hebron face criticism from Israelis who say they get in the way and Palestinians who insist they're good for nothing.</p>
<p>Thirty Norwegian observers have been stationed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank town for three months. The observers say they need more monitors to help them keep the peace.</p>
<p>On Monday, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) said they had concluded a deal to grant their wish and raise to 210 the number of observers to be stationed in Hebron. The signing however was put off.</p>
<p>Under the deal, more peacekeepers will arrive from Denmark, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey once Israel carries out its long-delayed handover of 80 percent of the volatile town to Palestinian self-rule.</p>
<p>The Norwegian observers are easily spotted in Hebron. The acronym TIPH -- standing for Temporary International Presence in Hebron -- is splashed in red on the back and chest of their royal blue sleeveless jackets and on bands on each arm.</p>
<p>They are posted to areas of friction, such as in the Arab vegetable market sandwiched between two Jewish enclaves in the heart of Hebron, and near al-Ibrahimi mosque, known as the Tomb of the Biblical Patriarchs holy to Jews and Moslems.</p>
<p>&quot;I think our presence has been good for people here because it prevents harassment from increasing, and soldiers are cautious about going too far in harassing Palestinians when we are around,&quot; said observer Tor Vaagli.</p>
<p>Good or not, their presence is little appreciated on either side of the Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>
<p>Unarmed, the observers have no military function. Their mandate is to record and report breaches of human rights, to give Palestinians in the town a more secure feeling.</p>
<p>&quot;We see them as unnecessary, irrelevant and bothersome. There is no reason for them to be here. We try not to have anything to do with them. We see no reason for people who have no understanding for the complexity of Hebron to be interfering in our lives,&quot; said Hebron settlers' spokesman David Wilder.</p>
<p>Joumaa Abu Rumeileh, a Palestinian schoolteacher, criticised the observers but for the opposite reason. Palestinians want to see the observers take a more active role confronting Jewish settlers and Israeli soldiers.</p>
<p>&quot;Practically they are here for a picnic. They are of no use to us. They only watch us and do nothing when we are harassed or beaten up by soldiers and settlers,&quot; Abu Rmeileh told Reuters. &quot;They are good for nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Hebron, a traditional flashpoint of violence, is the only West Bank town where Jews live in the heart of a Moslem population -- 400 settlers living and studying in enclaves surrounded by 100,000 Palestinians.</p>
<p>Soldiers' harassment of Palestinians had decreased recently, Vaagli said. &quot;Harassment is mostly done by the settlers.&quot;</p>
<p>Last week an off-duty Israeli soldier sprayed gunfire into the Arab market, wounding seven Palestinians. Three years ago, a Jewish settler massacred 29 Palestinian worshippers in al-Ibrahimi mosque.</p>
