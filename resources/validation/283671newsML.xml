<p>Polish shares rose for the second straight session and analysts said the dominant buying after price-fixing signalled prices were attractive enough for the bourse to extend gains on Friday.</p>
<p>They said the market, which has risen 8.5 percent since December 10, might be benefiting from the expectation that investment funds would buy more at the start of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a possibility, but we'll have to see how turnovers go, because they're low now, possibly because some investors might have taken a vacation during the short week,&quot; said Ryszard Wojnowski, an analyst at Bank Gdanski brokerage.  </p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index rose 0.6 percent to 14,423.8 and turnover fell 20.7 percent to 68.1 million zlotys on both markets.</p>
<p>Analysts said the main market could test its October 9, 30-month high at 15,078.7 points later in the quarter.</p>
<p>They said investors may have already priced in the central bank's comments it might raise interest rates as early as mid-January to curb fast credit growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Also rates might only increase by about one percent to scare investors a little, because any more might be too dear,&quot; said Roman Sosnowski, an analyst at Bank Staropolski brokerage.  </p>
<p>Analysts said top gainer Novita surged 9.5 percent after it sold a stake in a subsidiary.</p>
<p>They said Espebepe surged 9.3 percent on speculative demand, as the firm still had financial problems.</p>
<p>They said Sokolow, up 7.5 percent in active trade, may have been helped by its Thursday statement it sought a strategic investor.</p>
<p>NFI units rose 0.7 percent to 143.5 zlotys but fell the same amount to 145 zlotys in 9.1-million-zloty continuous trade. -- Steven Silber +48 22 653 9700</p>
