<headline>Farm Council call for quick transfer of vet office.</headline>

<p>The Farm Council issued a statement calling for the speedy transfer of an Office for Veterinary and Plant Health Inspections and Controls to Ireland, Irish Farm Minister Ivan Yates said on Monday.</p>
<p>The statement noted the European Commission's assurance that the transfer, in accordance with a European Council decision of October 29, 1993, shall be completed &quot;as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>It asked the Commission to ensure that adequate staff are provided so that the office can carry out its tasks in an &quot;effective and efficient manner.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Commission has proposed the creation of an independent agency which would be part funded by veterinary inspection fees but a final decision can only be taken after the European Parliament has given an opinion.</p>
<p>Member states have been at odds over the status and funding of the new agency, which would be located in Grange, County Meath, Ireland.</p>
<p>Some member states want the agency to be independent while others want it to remain an office controlled by DG VI (the directorate general for agriculture) and fully funded from the EU budget.</p>
