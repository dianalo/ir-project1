<headline>U.S. official testifies on donor's ties to Clinton.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-06-05</dateline>

<p>Nancy Soderberg, a top national security aide to President Bill Clinton, testified before a federal grand jury about White House contacts with Democratic donor Roger Tamraz, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The grand jury is investigating whether anyone tried to bribe or pressure administration officials into supporting Tamraz or his proposal to build a multibillion-dollar pipeline from the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>Soderberg is in line to be nominated as U.S. representative to the United Nations for special political affairs.</p>
<p>The U.N. job carries with it ambassadorial rank and requires Senate confirmation, so how she handled the Tamraz affair could directly affect her future, the Post said.</p>
<p>Soderberg backed her deputy Sheila Heslin, in 1995 and 1996 when both Donald Fowler, co-chairman of the Democratic Party and a high-ranking Energy Department official, allegedly tried to pressure Heslin to support Tamarz in his efforts to seek U.S. endorsement of his pipeline proposal.</p>
<p>Soderberg also agreed with Heslin that Tamraz should not be allowed into the White House because of suspicions he was misrepresenting the U.S. position on his pipeline.</p>
<p>Soderberg conveyed the NSC view to Fowler, but not other top Clinton aides, and the DNC continued to invite Tamraz to events with Clinton, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>At one of those events Tamraz spoke with the president about his project, and Clinton directed his chief of staff Mack McLarty to follow up.</p>
<p>Heslin told the grand jury recently that a top Energy Department official, Jack Carter, told her Tamraz was a big Democratic donor and a White House meeting to discuss his project would result in further contributions to the president's 1996 campaign.</p>
<p>But Heslin said she would not drop her opposition to the project or Tamraz's White House access.</p>
