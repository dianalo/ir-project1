<p>Irish paper and packaging group Jefferson Smurfit Plc said on Tuesday that it had seen a recent recovery in demand but thought the benefits of a turnaround would be too late to impact on 1996 results.</p>
<p>&quot;... across our broad range of products we have recently seen a recovery in demand,&quot; Smurfit said in a results statement which showed a drop of 37 percent in first half pre-tax profit to 126 million Irish pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;While price increases for containerboard have been announced in the U.S. and Europe, the effect of any such price increase is likely to occur too late to impact on the operational results for 1996,&quot; Smurfit said.  </p>
<p>Smurfit said it would agree with &quot;Paper and Forest products analysts who see some time in 1997&quot; as the time for recovery in the paper sector with containerboard leading the way.</p>
<p>The group, which said operations in all regions suffered in the first half from price reductions and from worldwide over-capacity in the industry, announced a seven percent increase in its half-year dividend to 1.5 pence per share.</p>
<p>It said the volatility in paper, box and waste fibre pricing over the last 24 months would seem to herald a period of more rapid price changes ahead.  </p>
<p>&quot;Currently there is over-capacity in American containerboard production which is forcing companies to take downtime to avoid increased inventory,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Smurfit said the amount of downtime has not been adequate to maintain a balance between supply and demand and this has led to prices remaining under pressure across all its markets.</p>
<p>&quot;The volatility in most of our markets ... and the pace of subsequent price decline, continued into the first six months of 1996,&quot; Smurfit said.  </p>
<p>Smurfit said maintaining a strong balance sheet remained a key objective of the company and as a result capital expenditure was being strictly controlled.</p>
<p>&quot;The group's balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry with our debt/equity ratio at a healthy 34 percent and net assets per share of 1.35 pence.</p>
