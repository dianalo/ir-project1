<p>After many years of fruitless effort to create an EU-wide market for pension funds, the European Commission is preparing to put the issue back on the political agenda.</p>
<p>Voluntary, privately run pension schemes are developing quickly in the European Union to supplement statutory pensions which are in dire need of reform due to an ageing population.</p>
<p>EU pension fund assets currently represent over 1.1 trillion European currency units. The potential for growth is also high as the ratio of EU pensioners to workers is set to double in the next 40 years.</p>
<p>But although the benefits of voluntary pensions are being progressively acknowledged by most national governments, few have agreed to allow assets to be invested and managed freely -- something the Commission has been arguing for since 1991 when it proposed an ill-fated pension funds directive.</p>
<p>Instead, many restrictions to cross-border investments by pension funds exist, such as the obligation to invest a high percentage of assets in domestic fixed-income securities.</p>
<p>Governments usually justify the obstacles on prudential grounds but the Commission believes they are aimed at keeping captive markets for government bonds.</p>
<p>In fact, only Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands have so far supported the Commission's stance that minimum or maximum investment requirements hamper the development of privately run funds and violate the free movement of capital in the EU's single market.</p>
<p>In December 1994, the Commission withdrew the draft pension funds directive, COM(93)237, refusing to accept a compromise backed by a majority of EU states which would have forced funds to invest up to 80 percent of their assets in securities denominated in the currency of the country where pensions will be paid -- the so-called currency-matching rules.</p>
<p>But it warned it would challenge, including in the European Court of Justice, any unjustified investment restrictions -- a lengthy process which was indeed initiated against Belgium and Finland in 1996.</p>
<p>The Commission's next step will be relaunching a new, wide-ranging debate with national governments, the fund industry and businesses. As a basis for the debate, a green paper on pension funds will be adopted in the next two or three months, Commission officials said.</p>
<p>The paper is expected to address a broad range of issues from whether there is a need to regulate pension funds in the first place; to the impact of tax on the industry; and whether life insurance and pension funds should be governed by the same rules since they are largely competing with each other.</p>
<p>This hardly seems a great leap forward, but the industry accepts it as the only possible route.</p>
<p>&quot;We think this is a very good move,&quot; Koen de Ryck, permanent representative of the European Federation for Retirement Provision (EFRP), told Reuters. The EFRP represents European pension funds.</p>
<p>De Ryck's optimism stems largely from the belief that the green paper will have great &quot;political weight&quot; unlike the Commission's past initiiatives.</p>
<p>The paper is being drafted under the auspices of EU Internal Market Commissioner Mario Monti, a respected Italian economist who has helped change his own country's traditional stance in the pension fund debate.</p>
<p>It has the backing also of European Economic Affairs Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy because of the heavy strain exerted by statutory pensions on national budgets at a time when governments are struggling to meet tough economic criteria for the EU's single currency.</p>
<p>The greater awareness of the pension challenge even in countries traditionally opposed to voluntary schemes will also be a determining factor.</p>
<p>&quot;The pressure for changes is so enormous that I think (new legislation) will come a lot quicker than expected,&quot; De Ryck said.</p>
<p>France recently passed legislation to allow the creation of supplementary pension schemes despite long-standing opposition, especially from the trade unions.</p>
<p>Italy and Spain, two other large EU countries which also opposed the Commission's plans in the past, are also moving towards a more flexible approach.</p>
<p>Besides the green paper, the Commission is also expected to open a second front in its fight to promote European pension funds in proposing legislation to ensure that supplementary schemes do not obstract workers' mobility. This could also happen in the spring, Commission officials said.</p>
<p>According to a report by a group of national experts chaired by former French Health Minister Simone Veil, European workers may indeed be less inclined to move to another country if this means losing pension rights. This happens because of different minimum qualifying periods for acquiring pension rights.</p>
<p>Large multinationals are usually able to preserve the rights of their expatriate employees. But many a company is faced with a poor labour mobility and certain professionals which may belong to sectoral funded schemes, such as nurses, have problems of their own.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the intention of addressing the problem met by seconded employees,&quot; a Commission official said. &quot;This is about creating more economic growth and encouraging people to move from high unemployment regions to more dynamic ones,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>This second aspect is being tackled by European Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn.</p>
