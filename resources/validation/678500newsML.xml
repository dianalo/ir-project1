<title>FRANCE: Relatives to commemorate TWA crash victims in July.</title>
<headline>Relatives to commemorate TWA crash victims in July.</headline>
<dateline>LILLE, France 1997-06-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>A group representing families of 230 people killed in the crash of a TWA jet outlined plans on Saturday to mark the first anniversary of the disaster in New York and called a TWA compensation offer blackmail.</p>
<p>The &quot;Victims of Flight 800&quot; said the July 17-20 commemorations would include a cathedral service and a plaque for those killed when the Paris-bound plane crashed in the Atlantic just after takeoff from New York last July 17.</p>
<p>Michel Breistoff, deputy head of the group, said TWA had sent letters to some families offering an immediate $75,000 in compensation to any who renounced legal action against the airline for the crash.</p>
<p>&quot;It's blackmail,&quot; he said at a meeting of the group near Lille, northern France. The association represents relatives of victims from countries including the United States, France, Spain, Italy, Britain, Norway and Finland.</p>
<p>TWA wrote that compensation under international conventions could take many years to settle if TWA were found responsible, he said.</p>
<p>The cause of the crash of the Paris-bound flight is unknown. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said in May mechanical failure was probably responsible but that a missile or a bomb had not been ruled out.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the way things are going,&quot; Breistoff said. &quot;I think that they're trying to prepare us for a conclusion with no explanation and no one responsible.&quot;</p>
<p>The head of the group, Jose Cremades, said relatives were organising a service in New York's Saint Patrick's cathedral on July 17, to be attended by New York mayor Rudolph Guiliani.</p>
<p>&quot;More than 500 people are also expected on Saturday morning at Calverton where the wreck of the jet has been reconstructed,&quot; Cremades said. &quot;We will unveil a commemorative plaque with the names of the victims.&quot;</p>
<p>Cremades said the FBI had told relatives it would not publish conclusions of its investigation until September &quot;because of the complexity of the inquiry&quot;.</p>
