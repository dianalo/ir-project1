<title>PANAMA: Panama to clamp down on tuna fish violators.</title>

<p>Panama plans to clamp down harder on Panamanian-flagged ships caught violating tuna conservation efforts in order to avoid an international embargo, a top government official said Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Panama has done some work but we are going to establish more norms ... so that ships found not in compliance will be sanctioned with fines from $10,000 to $100,000 or have their registry taken away,&quot; Arnulfo Franco of Panama's National Maritime Commission told reporters.  </p>
<p>Franco told reporters that Panamanian maritime officials told the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) last week in Spain that &quot;we still don't have any evidence&quot; that Panamanian-flagged ships are violating international tuna conservation efforts.</p>
<p>In a meeting in San Sebastian, Spain, the commission cleared the way for its members to ban imports of bluefin tuna from Belize, Honduras and Panama, which are not members.</p>
<p>The commission warned the three countries last year that fishing of the giant tuna on their ships was undermining efforts to save the fish.</p>
<p>ICCAT gave Panama, which has the world's largest registry of nearly 13,700 ships, up to Jan. 1, 1998, to show its measures are working before a ban would begin. Some eight percent of Panamanian-flagged ships are dedicated to fishing.</p>
<p>Most of the exports from the three countries go to Japan, which consumes up to 70 percent of the world's catch.</p>
<p>Japan imported a total of 674 metric tons of bluefin tuna from Belize, Panama and Honduras in 1994.</p>
