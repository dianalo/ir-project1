<p>Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah becomes the first senior Saudi official to visit Lebanon in nearly two decades when he arrives in Beirut on Thursday to discuss the stalled Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>He will also hold talks on a controversial economic summit in Doha which Israel is expected to attend and which some Arab states want to postpone until peace negotiations resume, diplomats said.</p>
<p>&quot;The main topic will be the peace process. He wants to make sure that Arab states hold a united position on the peace process,&quot; a diplomat told Reuters.</p>
<p>Beirut newspapers have welcomed the visit, the first by a senior Saudi official since Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal came in 1978 in a bid to curb violence during Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war.</p>
<p>&quot;This visit is of crucial importance since it represents Saudi support to both Lebanon and Syria in their confrontation with Israel,&quot; the pro-Syrian daily Ash-Sharq said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lebanese officials believe it signals the lifting of an undeclared ban on the travel of top Saudi princes to Lebanon imposed during the civil war, particularly since the mid-1980s when Moslem militiamen sacked the Saudi consulate in Beirut.</p>
<p>The prince will arrive from Damascus where he was to have talks with President Hafez al-Assad. Official Saudi radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, quoted him on Wednesday as issuing a tough warning that the peace process was in danger.</p>
<p>&quot;What is happening in the land of Arab Palestine is a warning of coming danger,&quot; he said in comments broadcast on the radio.</p>
<p>&quot;What future for peace has the world with the adventurers who have no political or ethical awareness of justice and peace?&quot; he added in an apparent reference to the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Gulf diplomats expected the prince to support Syria's stand in the peace process in his talks with Assad. Damascus demands a pledge by Israel to withdraw fully from the Golan Heights as a condition for resuming their peace talks, suspended for over a year.</p>
<p>Oil giant Saudi Arabia is a political heavyweight in the Middle East and a key U.S. ally.</p>
<p>Arab states were angered this month by a non-binding vote in the U.S. House of Representatives calling on President Bill Clinton to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital.</p>
<p>Arab frustrations have been underscored by the coming Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic conference in Doha due to be held in November and attended by Israel which took part in all three previous summits.</p>
<p>Syria is lobbying for postponement of this year's MENA summit until Middle East peace talks resume. Some Gulf Arab states also favour postponing the summit.</p>
<p>Diplomats said Crown Prince Abdullah was expected to raise the issue with officials in Syria where the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria and Gulf Arab states are holding separate talks on the formation of a common Arab market and how to revive the peace process.</p>
<p>Gulf sources have said Saudi Arabia was among Gulf Arab states rallying for postponement of the Doha summit but diplomats said it appeared more flexible than Syria.</p>
<p>&quot;The Saudis think it (the Doha summit) can't be a success with the current state of the peace process. But they appear to be keeping an open mind,&quot; a diplomat said.</p>
<p>The prince will also discuss the issue with officials in Lebanon, whose foreign policy operates in tandem with Syria, the diplomats said.</p>
<p>The prince was also expected to discuss the Lebanese government's multi-billion dollar drive to rebuild Beirut, ravaged by the civil war.</p>
<p>The official Saudi Development Fund has lent about $145 million to help fund projects such as reconstruction of schools.</p>
