<p>Bahrain's State Security Court on Saturday sentenced 22 people accused of involvement in an alleged pro-Iranian plot to topple the government to prison terms ranging from three to seven years, lawyers said.</p>
<p>They said 11 other suspects were acquitted. There was no immediate official confirmation of the verdicts.</p>
<p>&quot;The court passed verdicts on 33 suspects today (Saturday),&quot; one lawyer told Reuters. &quot;Eleven people were acquitted and the rest received between seven and three years in jail,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The court, whose rulings cannot be appealed against, on Wednesday sentenced 15 people to prison terms ranging from three to 15 years in connection with the alleged plot.</p>
<p>They included two main suspects, Ali al-Mutqawi, who received 15 years jail and was fined 7,000 dinars ($18,568) and Sheikh Jassim al-Kayat, who was sentenced to 12 years and was fined 5,000 dinars.</p>
<p>The trial of 81 suspects -- 22 of them in absentia -- began on March 1. They were accused of joining the military wing of the Bahraini Hizbollah (Party of God), creating an organisation aimed at toppling the government, possessing weapons without permission and contacting a foreign country.</p>
<p>Lawyers had said the suspects could have faced the death penalty.</p>
<p>It was not clear what verdicts were delivered against those tried in absentia.</p>
<p>Bahrain last June accused Iran of an attempt to topple the island's government by force, a charge denied by Tehran.</p>
<p>The court, set up by the government in March last year to speed up rulings, passed the first verdicts on Wednesday which coincided with the first anniversary of the execution by firing squad of Isa Qamber for killing a policeman.</p>
<p>Members of Bahrain's majority Shi'ite Moslem community have waged sporadic protests, bombings, arson attacks and violence since December 1994 to demand political and economic reforms from the largely Sunni government.</p>
<p>At least 28 people have been killed and hundreds arrested in the unrest in the Gulf's main banking and financial centre.</p>
