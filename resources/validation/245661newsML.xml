<title>CZECH REPUBLIC: CZECH DRAFT BUDGET DEBATE SET TO BEGIN WEDNESDAY.</title>
<headline>CZECH DRAFT BUDGET DEBATE SET TO BEGIN WEDNESDAY.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1996-12-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Czech parliament on Tuesday approved the agenda for its final session of 1996, with debate on the second reading of the draft scheduled to be the first item up for discussion on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Budget committee officials had hoped for the debate to begin later on Tuesday, but the finalising of points on the agenda took longer than anticipated, and members on the floor said they would prefer to open the talks on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Jozef Wagner, chairman of the budget committee and a member of the opposition Social Democrats, told Reuters earlier in the day that the two minor coalition parties may stall a vote on the second reading as they look to change several minor points.</p>
<p>The Civic Democratic Aliance (ODA) has said it would support the 1997 draft balanced budget in its final readings only if a timetable for liberalising these controlled prices and tax cuts were taken.</p>
<p>The Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL) have also said they may not support the budget because of a last-minute cutting of funds from the defense ministry, which it controls.</p>
<p>Ironically, Wagner said Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus could probably rely on the support of the Social Democrats (CSSD) to pass the second reading, even if the coalition fails him.</p>
<p>The coalition lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies in the general election last spring, winning 99 of 200 seats, making every vote for final budget approval crucial.</p>
<p>ODA has 13 votes in parliament while the KDU-CSL has 18 seats. The budget draft passed its first reading thanks to four opposition Social Democrats who crossed party ranks.</p>
<p>The government's fifth straight balanced budget draft proposes revenues and expenditures each totalling 549.1 billion crowns next year, after a 1996 balanced budget plan which forecasts a revised total of roughly 491 billion crowns.</p>
<p>A third and final reading of the budget cannot come sooner than 48 hours after the second reading is approved.</p>
