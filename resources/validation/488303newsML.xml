<p>Engineers began fuelling the space shuttle Columbia on Friday for an afternoon blastoff on a 16-day science mission to study fire in space, NASA officials said.</p>
<p>Columbia was scheduled to lift off from Florida's Kennedy Space Centre at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT).</p>
<p>Launch controllers began pumping half a million gallons of supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen into the shuttle's rust-coloured strap-on fuel tank shortly after 6 a.m. EST (1100 GMT), NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham said.</p>
<p>The fuelling operation was held up for about an hour while engineers checked for a possible problem with one of Columbia's three electricity-generating fuel cells. The device had shown some unusual voltage readings but later returned to normal.</p>
<p>&quot;They are going to continue to monitor it, but there was enough confidence in the fuel cell to proceed with the countdown,&quot; Buckingham said.</p>
<p>There was sufficient slack in the countdown schedule to accommodate the late fuelling without delaying the shuttle's liftoff, he said.</p>
<p>The crew of seven were due to start boarding Columbia, NASA's oldest shuttle, at around 11:15 a.m. EST (1615 GMT).</p>
<p>During their 16 days aloft, the astronauts will work around the clock in two shifts in a laboratory module mounted in the shuttle's cargo bay. They will light more than 200 fires in a specially designed chamber to learn more about how flames behave in space and on the earth.</p>
<p>Other experiments will attempt to determine the structure of proteins associated with various diseases and develop new, stronger materials.</p>
<p>Excellent weather was forecast for the shuttle's 2-1/2 hour launch window. Meteorologists predicted a 90 percent chance of acceptable weather.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of tourists were expected to line the roads around the Kennedy Space Centre to watch the shuttle's rare afternoon blastoff, which coincides with school holidays.</p>
<p>The shuttle would also provide an unexpected flying display for visitors to an air show at nearby Patrick Air Force Base.</p>
<p>&quot;It'll give those spectators something else to watch,&quot; shuttle operations director Bob Sieck said.</p>
<p>Columbia's launch was running a day late because engineers had to install thermal insulation missing from pipes in the shuttle's cooling system, a problem that may have gone undetected for more than 13 years.</p>
