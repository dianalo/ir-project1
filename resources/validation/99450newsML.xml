<p>U.N. investigators have found 200 bodies in a mass grave in eastern Croatia believed to contain remains of hospital patients executed after Serb forces seized the region in 1991, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the U.N. transitional authority in Eastern Slavonia, a Serb-held enclave due to revert to Croatian government rule next year, said the bodies had been shipped to Zagreb for forensic examination.</p>
<p>They were unearthed in a field a few km (miles) south of Vukovar, main town in the enclave of Eastern Slavonia captured by separatist minority Serbs in a 1991 revolt against Croatia's move to independence from Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Prosecutors for the International Criminal Tribunal on former Yugoslavia (ICTY) believe the Ovcara mass grave held the remains of 160 or more Croat hospital patients removed from Vukovar after the town's fall to Serb besiegers.</p>
<p>&quot;Two hundred bodies were found in all. Most were skeletised but all appear to be male and none was found in military uniform,&quot; U.N. spokesman Yuri Chizhik said by telephone from Vukovar, 330 (200 miles) east of Zagreb.</p>
<p>&quot;Some bodies bore telltale signs of having been medical patients -- plaster casts and so forth,&quot; Chizhik said.</p>
<p>ICTY forensic scientists, accompanied by Croatian and Serb experts, will spend several weeks examining the bodies at Zagreb University's pathology laboratory to identify them and pinpoint the cause of death.</p>
<p>Chizhik said spent bullet casings were discovered around the excavated pit, which measured six by eight metres (20 by 26 feet) and was two metres (6.6 feet deep).</p>
<p>Circumstantial evidence and eyewitness accounts suggest that the bodies found at Ovcara were machinegunned nearby.</p>
<p>Some of the patients in besieged Vukovar's main hospital were wounded Croatian soldiers. Whether any of them wound up in the Ovcara grave will be determined by autopsies.</p>
<p>William Haglund, chief of the ICTY team which has also exhumed mass graves of Moslem civilians massacred by separatist Serbs in eastern Bosnia, said earlier that some bodies found at Ovcara bore traces of trauma injuries.</p>
<p>The Hague tribunal has indicted three Yugoslav army officers for war crimes and crimes against humanity over the Ovcara killings but all remain at large, probably in Serbia.</p>
<p>The excavation of the Ovcara site began on August 30 and were completed on Friday.</p>
<p>International and local media were banned from Ovcara during the exhumation to avoid inflaming emotions that could have harmed the peace process in Eastern Slavonia, where Croat refugees are to be resettled among their old Serb enemies.</p>
<p>The area, secured by 5,000 combat-capable U.N. troops, is scheduled to return to the sovereignty of the Zagreb government by the end of 1997 at the latest.</p>
<p>Vukovar fell to the Serbs after a three-month artillery and tank siege that reduced the once elegant old Austro-Hungarian provincial town on the Danube River to rubble.</p>
