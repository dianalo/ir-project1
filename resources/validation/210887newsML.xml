<p>Legislation allowing the creation of private pension funds in France should be effective at the start of 1997, following National Assembly approval on Friday, Jean-Pierre Thomas, main sponsor of the pensions bill said.</p>
<p>The bill now goes to the Senate, lower house of parliament, which will examine it on December 12 and open consultations with the National Assembly if there are problems.</p>
<p>&quot;The text has essentially been passed. The senators can make modifications or add imporvements. I think we should have an effective text at the start of 1997, Thomas told reporters after the bill was voted in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Jean Arthuis says the funds should collect &quot;about 30 billion francs&quot; in the first year.</p>
<p>&quot;This bill is fundamental to the French people's future, the dynamism of the economy and for social dialogue,&quot; said junior finance and trade minister Yves Galland said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a two-speed system. It's an accumulative system. It's a historic move forward,&quot; he said, referring to fears among critics that the bill will run counter to the state-backed system for retirement benefits.</p>
<p>Louis Mexandeau of the Socialist Party said, however, that the existing pension system based on shared distribution of contributions was threatened.</p>
<p>&quot;In reality, this law will create a situation where what is supposed to be a complement replaces what exists, the social security system,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a watershed.&quot;</p>
<p>The words were harsher from Maxime Gremetz, Communist Party spokesman on the bill, who described the bill as &quot;a backward step in civilisation for wage-earners&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We're the last of the Mohicans in this Europe where capital rules,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Amid the fire, Thomas, parliament's reporter on the bill, stressed that the new funds would run in tandem with the basic state-backed system.</p>
<p>&quot;The shared retirement system which will be bolstered ... and secured in the short, medium amd long term,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The text adopted on Friday allows for the creation of private funds run by banks, insurers and mutual groups and subject to company tax.</p>
<p>Contributors will be allowed income tax write-offs to the tune of five percent of their annual gross salary or the equivalent of the social security monthly ceiling, currently 13,540 francs.</p>
<p>Employers paying parallel contributions, limited to four times that of the employee, will have the right to reductions of payroll charges to the tune of 4,000 francs monthly plus two percent of the gross annual salary in question. These sums will not be subject to company tax.</p>
<p>Pension funds will not be allowed to invest more than 65 percent of what they collect in government debt, favouring investment in stocks without conflicting with European Union laws which prohibit setting share investment quotas.</p>
