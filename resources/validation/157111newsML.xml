<title>GERMANY: Accused cheered at German investment fraud trial.</title>
<headline>Accused cheered at German investment fraud trial.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-10-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>A hundred investors packed a Frankfurt courtroom on Thursday to cheer the founders of a so-called &quot;pyramid&quot; investment club accused of taking their money in Germany's largest ever criminal fraud.</p>
<p>Four defendants are accused of using their European Kings Club to cheat 94,000 participants out of 850 million marks ($560 million) in the space of four years with a scheme promising staggering annual yields of 72 percent.</p>
<p>Pyramid schemes rely on existing investors recruiting ever more new members to finance the yields with their initial outlay. The schemes inevitably fail when not enough new recruits can be found to pay the returns of those higher up the pyramid.</p>
<p>Despite the Kings Club's collapse and bankruptcy in late 1995, the investors who had come on buses from Germany, Austria and Switzerland clearly felt it could have gone on making money for them and blamed authorities for bringing about its end.</p>
<p>&quot;For the members of this club, this trial is a farce,&quot; said one. &quot;Although we have lost a lot of money, we don't regret anything. If the defendants are acquitted, we want to carry on.&quot;</p>
<p>The former president of the club, Damara Bertges, and three other officials were originally charged in connection with 33,000 cases of fraud linked to an astonishing 675,000 illegal bank transactions.</p>
<p>Prosecutors selected 678 model cases for the trial -- still producing a charge sheet which will take two months to read out in court in full.</p>
<p>Investors had to pay 1,400 marks to join the club, an outlay which was intended to guarantee them large payouts starting with 2,400 marks in the first year.</p>
<p>So far around 50,000 creditors have filed petitions against the club.</p>
