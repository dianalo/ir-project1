<p>Up to 1,000 Bosnian war invalids, veterans and families of dead soldiers halted traffic in the Moslem-controlled town of Tuzla on Friday to protest against the government's failure to pay war pensions.</p>
<p>Demonstrators, many on crutches, occupied all main junctions in the town and its outskirts. Police watched the protest without trying to disperse the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;Families of dead soldiers and war invalids have organised this because of unpaid war and invalid pensions, which the government hasn't paid for six months,&quot; said Alija Muharemovic, 28, on crutches because he lost his right foot.</p>
<p>The government in Sarajevo had approved the funds but the money had never reached Tuzla, he said.</p>
<p>Civil unrest has been uncommon in Bosnia since more than three years of war ended in December. But the war has shattered the country's industry and economy, and left the majority of people with virtually no income.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been wounded three times. How do you think I should feel now -- betrayed and deceived,&quot; said Muharemovic.</p>
<p>Only a few armoured vehicles of the NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR) managed to drive through the crowd on their way to a nearby U.S. military base. Demonstrators firmly turned all other cars back.</p>
<p>&quot;I've lost four sons in the war and my wife died after we came here. I get only five marks ($3.30) a month,&quot; said Munib Muminovic, a refugee from Srebrenica which was captured by Serb forces amid reports of massacres last year.</p>
