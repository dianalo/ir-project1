<p>A man who called himself &quot;Commander Pedro&quot; was convicted Monday by a federal jury of two bank robberies in Ohio.</p>
<p>Peter Kevin Langan, 38, faces 35 years to life in prison without parole on three different charges involving bank robbery, Dale Ann Goldberg, U.S. Attorney for Ohio's southern district, said.</p>
<p>He also faces trial for assault on federal agents in connection with his arrest in a shootout in Columbus in January 1996, she said.</p>
<p>Langan and four others were also indicted by a federal grand jury last month in Philadelphia for conspiracy to rob banks, eastern Pennsylvania U.S. Attorney Michael Stiles said.</p>
<p>That indictment named Langan, Mark William Thomas of Macungie, Pa., Scott Anthony Stedeford, also called &quot;Tuco,&quot; of Ardmore, Pa., Kevin William McCarthy, also called &quot;Blondie,&quot; of Philadelphia, and Michael Willaim Brescia, or &quot;Tim,&quot; of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>It charged that they recruited young people to rob banks and used false identifies to rent &quot;safe houses,&quot; buy getaway cars and register at motels.</p>
<p>That indictment also named Richard Lee Guthrie Jr., called &quot;Wild Bill&quot; or &quot;Commander Pavell.&quot; Guthrie, 38, pleaded guilty in Cincinnati to 19 bank robberies but was found hanged in his jail cell last year.</p>
