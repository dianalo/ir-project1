<p>Chrysler Japan Sales Ltd (CJS), the Japanese unit of Chrysler Corp, said on Wednesday it hopes to sell about 30,000 Chrysler cars in Japan in calendar 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;We have yet to finalise our next year's sales target but we hope to boost sales to 28,000 or 30,000 by introducing the Voyager minivan and Dodge Viper next year,&quot; Hideo Hougi, president of CJS, told a news conference.</p>
<p>CJS has forecast sales in Japan of 25,000 units in 1996, up from 14,500 a year earlier. However, Japanese sales of Chrysler cars stood at only 11,587 in the first nine months of 1996, up 0.9 percent from 1995, industry data shows.</p>
<p>Hougi said 1996 sales were likely to be below 20,000 units, partly because of slower-than-expected sales of the &quot;Neon&quot; model, Hougi said.</p>
<p>CJS launched the Neon in May, with a sales target for 1996 of 4,000. But sales until October were expected to be only 800, said Osamu Nagata, CJS vice president in charge of marketing.  </p>
<p>Japanese and international media reports dubbed the Neon the &quot;Japan Killer&quot; when it made its debut at the Frankfurt motor show in 1993 because it was expected to undercut the price of most domestic models in the Japanese market.</p>
<p>Hougi also said Chrysler would launch a right-hand-drive version of the Jeep Wrangler sport-utility vehicle in Japan.</p>
<p>The new Wrangler will go on sale on November 8 with a sales target of 2,500 units for calendar 1997, he said.</p>
<p>Chrysler introduced a right-hand-drive version of its Cherokee in 1993, and one of its Grand Cherokee in April.</p>
<p>Chrysler will cut the Japanese price of the new Wrangler by 580,000 to 590,000 yen from that of its predecessors, making the base price 2.37 million yen for the cheapest model.</p>
<p>Chrysler Japan was also due to launch a right-hand-drive version of the Chrysler Voyager minivan late this year.</p>
<p>But Chrysler has delayed production of the new Voyager for the Japanese market as CJS has asked for improvements in some parts of the model, Hougi said.</p>
<p>Asked if the yen's current weakness at around 114 to the dollar would affect the company's business, Hougi said: &quot;We want the yen's value against the dollar to be below 110. But we don't care about temporary moves as we guess the yen value will eventually return to around 105 in the long-term.&quot;</p>
