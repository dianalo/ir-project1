<title>UK: LIFFE cocoa rides on strong grinds, shaves gains.</title>
<headline>LIFFE cocoa rides on strong grinds, shaves gains.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>London cocoa futures were propelled by surprisingly high European third quarter grind figures but origin and scale-up trade selling trimmed gains before the close.</p>
<p>Traders noted short-covering and trade-related buying on the back of strong Dutch and UK grind data released in early hours of the session. A small dose of industry buying was also cited.</p>
<p>Volume was relatively limited with many players travelling to Paris for an annual trade dinner. But traders were impressed by Friday's price reversal after four consecutive days of losses.</p>
<p>&quot;Considering how bad the market has been performing, 10 stg-up is important,&quot; said one trader, referring to the benchmark March contract before the close. Minutes after the grind news, March rose to a high of 1,000 stg a tonne and hovered just below that level throughout most of the session. It pared gains slightly in late dealings, ending seven stg up from Thursday at 992 stg.</p>
<p>Turnover was relatively thin at 3,602 lots.</p>
<p>The UK grind, up 42 percent from a year ago at 48,855 tonnes, outpaced even the wildest guesses. One industry estimate last week of around 20 percent was said to be conditional.</p>
<p>But the rise was believed to have been partly helped by the resumption of production at a major plant of top UK chocolate manufacturer Mars. The year-ago grindings, the worst quarter in 1995, were affected by the closure of that plant.</p>
<p>The Dutch grind rose an impressive 16.69 percent to 99,549 tonnes in the third quarter against market expectations of around 10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a hell of a grind,&quot; said one trader. &quot;It's very, very bullish.&quot;</p>
<p>Switches were quiet on Friday, but the Dec/March spread was bid up slightly after Thursday's 25-26 stg.</p>
<p>Technically, the market remains in a downtrend until gains are extended above the 1,025 resistance, analysts said.</p>
