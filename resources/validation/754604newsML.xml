<p>The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said on Thursday his country firmly supported Germany's bid to take a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council.</p>
<p>But ambassador Bill Richardson, visiting Germany to discuss United Nations reform, declined to say whether Washington supported Bonn's desire to have the powers of veto which the five current permanent members have.</p>
<p>&quot;We propose five new permanent members. Two have been named -- Germany and Japan -- and the remaining three should be from developing nations,&quot; Richardson told journalists before meeting Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.</p>
<p>&quot;Germany is a vital player on the international scene through the contributions it makes to the U.N. and its activities both in peacekeeping and development process and its contributions to specialised agencies,&quot; Richardson said.</p>
<p>Germany has long aspired to join China, France, Britain, Russia and the United States as a permanent member, arguing that it is one of the biggest financial contributors to the U.N. and deserves more influence.</p>
<p>Bonn says it is determined to have a permanent seat whether it gets veto powers or not.</p>
<p>Richardson said a task force led by the Senegalese ambassador to the U.N. would decide whether any of the proposed new members would be get a veto.</p>
<p>He also said the United States would not tolerate any dilution of its own current veto powers, and there were signs Russia and China would not accept this either.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, on his first visit to Bonn in April, said most U.N. member states did not support a proposal last year to withhold veto rights from new permanent members. But he did not say what this meant for Germany's chances.</p>
<p>Richardson said the United States supported Annan's proposed reforms to streamline the organisation and that it would back the creation of five or six extra permanent seats, but no more.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the Security Council needs to be reinvigorated and modernised. It's been doing a good job, but there are ways of making it more representative,&quot; Richardson said.</p>
<p>One diplomatic source in Bonn said proposals for Security Council enlargement were so contentious that they only had 50-50 chances of materialising, but that a decision would be made one way or another this year.</p>
<p>The source said Rome was particularly bitter about the U.S. proposal to include Germany and Japan, but not Italy.</p>
