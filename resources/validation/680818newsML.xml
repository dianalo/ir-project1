<p>Medical equipment maker Healthdyne Technologies Corp. opened the door to a deal with hostile bidder Invacare Corp. on Monday, saying it would talk with interested parties about a potential transaction.</p>
<p>But the Marietta, Ga.-based company set strict conditions for possible talks with Invacare, including a demand that it withdraw its hostile $200 million bid before receiving access to confidential financial information.</p>
<p>Healthdyne Technologies has repeatedly rejected Invacare's offer. Invacare initially launched a bid in January and has raised it three times to the current offer of $15 per share.</p>
<p>Although it said it would explore alternatives, Healthdyne Technologies still insisted that the company is not for sale.</p>
<p>&quot;While the board has not made any decision to pursue any particular alternative, we believe it is prudent to talk with third parties to find out what the alternatives are,&quot; Healthdyne Chairman Parker Petit said in a news release.</p>
<p>The announcement sent shares of Healthdyne Technologies up $1.25 to $16.75 on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>In a letter to Invacare Chairman Malachi Mixon, Petit reiterated that the current offer is &quot;grossly inadequate.&quot;</p>
<p>But Parker also said Invacare was welcome to participate in the talks if it withdraws its tender offer, stops soliciting proxies and signs a confidentiality agreement. Invacare has launched a proxy fight to oust the Healthdyne Technologies board at its July 30 annual meeting of shareholders.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, if Healthdyne Technologies' board determines to sell the company to the highest bidder, Invacare would be invited to make a proposal to the board, which the board would consider along with any other proposals we have received,&quot; Petit wrote.</p>
<p>Elyria, Ohio-based Invacare could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Prior to the Healthdyne Technologies announcement, Invacare extended its offer until Aug. 1. It also said that its existing stake, together with the shares stockholders had already agreed to tender, would give it more than 35 percent of Healthdyne's outstanding shares.</p>
<p>Invacare has said it would not raise the hostile bid again, but has indicated it may be willing to pay more in a friendly transaction.</p>
<p>The move by Healthdyne will pressure Invacare to make a decision about the future of its offer, said Matthew Dodds, analyst at Dillon, Read &amp; Co Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;It's tough for Invacare right now, but it's good for Healthdyne shareholders,&quot; said Dodds, who thinks Healthdyne may be worth $17 per share.</p>
<p>Wall Street has considered Siemens AG of Germany and Britian's BOC Group Plc. as potential bidders, but neither company has come forward since Invacare launched its bid.</p>
<p>Healthdyne makes home health products for sleep disorders, breathing and infant monitors. It had sales of $118 million in 1996.</p>
<p>Invacare makes wheel chairs, medical care beds, respiratory products and cardiovascular equipment and had sales of $610 million in 1996.</p>
