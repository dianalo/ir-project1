<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates end down, spots up.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-04-22</dateline>

<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mostly down on Tuesday on a technical correction after solid gains in the past few days on the back of the surging domestic A share markets, traders said.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most actively traded seven-day contract fell to 9.51 percent from 11.20 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>Total turnover of the six-contract market tumbled to 5.7 million lots from 11.3 million.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>Traders said that after the surges of the past few trading days, a technical correction on Tuesday had been expected.  </p>
<p>In addition, there were no new A share issues on the stock markets today, limiting the demand for funds, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's fall in the repo rates was mainly due to a technical correction,&quot; said one trade. &quot;The lack of any new A share issues also decreased fund demand.&quot;</p>
<p>Trading volume dropped sharply today due to a sense that the A share indices were now high after the bull run of recent months, deterring speculators from borrowing heavily on the repo market to trade on the stock markets, traders said.</p>
<p>But traders said they expected the contracts to rise slightly in the next few days due to a number of new A share issues.  </p>
<p>&quot;The higher yields of existing contracts attracted a lot of buying today,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>But traders said the combined spot market volume was still thin today, indicating that there would be no solid gains for existing contracts in the short term.</p>
<p>They said the performance of domestic A share markets in the next few days would be the key factor affecting the spot market.</p>
<p>If the A markets continued their bull run, the spot market would fall with liquidity flowing out, they said.</p>
