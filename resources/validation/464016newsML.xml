<title>UK: Buyers to take up early pricing for Nigerian crude.</title>
<headline>Buyers to take up early pricing for Nigerian crude.</headline>

<p>An option to price Nigerian crude oil five days before it loads is likely to be taken up by buyers, oil traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>The option will cost buyers two cents a barrel for crude oil loading in April but because oil prices have recently sunk into contango it should cut the cost of purchases, they said.</p>
<p>Nigerian crude oil is priced against dated Brent which trades against forward Brent prices on the swaps market.</p>
<p>The Contract-For-Differences (CFD) swap market enables oil traders to lock in the value of dated Brent, and therefore Nigerian crude, against forward Brent.</p>
<p>The contango on the value of dated Brent market is roughly 10 cents a week.</p>
<p>This implies a two cents option to price five days early could save a trader around seven cents on a cargo of Nigerian crude.</p>
<p>Nigerian state oil marketer, NNPC, informed customers on Monday that it was cutting the cost of its crude oil in April by between 50 and 87 cents a barrel.</p>
<p>Many customers incurred heavy losses on March loadings due to a sharp fall in the spot value of Nigerian crude.</p>
<p>&quot;This option could be a way of giving back something to the trade after what happened in March. But it does depend on the contango staying in place,&quot; said a trader.</p>
