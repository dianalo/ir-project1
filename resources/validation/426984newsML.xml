<headline>Kevorkian attorney says woman took her own life.</headline>

<p>Dr. Jack Kevorkian's lawyer said Friday a 59-year-old Virginia woman took her own life Thursday but he refused to say whether the assisted suicide crusader was involved.</p>
<p>Helen Livengood, who suffered from chronic arthritis and weighed about 50 pounds, died by &quot;her own hand&quot;, attorney Geoffrey Fieger said at a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;They would probably rule it on the death certificate a suicide,&quot; he said. &quot;However, her intent was to end suffering.&quot;</p>
<p>Police in Romulus, south of Detroit, said in a statement Friday morning that they began investigating the woman's death Thursday evening after receiving a call that her body had been found at a hotel near the Detroit Metropolitan Airport.</p>
<p>Livengood's body was turned over to the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office for an autopsy. A spokesman for the office said the autopsy had not been completed yet.</p>
<p>WXYZ-TV reported a maid at the Hilton Suites hotel found Livengood's body and a note in her room that said to call her attorney, Fieger.</p>
<p>Fieger said he represented Livengood only for the purpose of making the announcement regarding her death. He would not say if Kevorkian was involved.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no statement or comment with regard to Dr. Kevorkian,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Livengood and her husband chartered a private jet to Detroit from Richmond, Virginia Thursday. Her husband returned home alone the same day.</p>
<p>Kevorkian was free on bond stemming from his latest scrape with Michigan authorities. A grand jury last November charged him and one of his longtime allies with violating Michigan's unwritten &quot;common law&quot; prohibiting assisted suicide by helping Loretta Peabody, 54, of Ionia, Michigan die Aug. 30.</p>
<p>Kevorkian agreed not to be present at any more assisted suicides as part of his bond condition terms. Last month the bodies of two women -- one in Kevorkian's Volkswagen van -- were left for authorities to find.</p>
<p>He never admitted involvement with their deaths, but Fieger later told a reporter, &quot;You have to have been born under a rock yesterday not to know who was involved in these cases.&quot;</p>
<p>At the request of prosecutors, an Ionia County Circuit Court judge last month tightened Kevorkian's bond conditions, but only for the county in rural west-central Michigan.</p>
<p>Kevorkian has formally acknowledged being present at 45 assisted suicides since 1990.</p>
