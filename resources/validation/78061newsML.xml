<p>Tanzania's long-delayed stock exchange will finally open in December, but foreign investors will be barred for the time being, the head of its regulatory authority said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Fratern Mboya, chief executive of Tanzania's Capital Markets and Securities Authority, told a news conference in Nairobi that Tanzania had now cleared most of the bottlenecks which had delayed the start of trading by nearly six months.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange was incorporated this month. We now have premises and we are about to appoint manpower,&quot; Mboya told reporters in the Kenyan capital.</p>
<p>&quot;We have held a three-week training programme for dealers and they shall sit for exams and then be licensed. Initially we shall have four to five dealers (brokers),&quot; Mboya added.</p>
<p>Trading would be by an open outcry system, he said.</p>
<p>Mboya said foreign portfolio investors would not be allowed to do business on the exchange &quot;at least initially&quot;. The Tanzanian authorities want to see how local investors perform before inviting foreign investors.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to gauge the local market. So we shall not allow foreign investors in the first companies to be listed. We also need to work on the laws that would affect their involvement.</p>
<p>&quot;We still do not have clear policy on foreign investments; I will be frank on this one. We are not allowing them,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Mboya said the authority had commissioned a study on requirements for a fast bourse growth -- including ways to tap into family companies or other private companies in which owners were still too reluctant to relinguish their shareholdings.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to look at the fiscal policies that impede or promote stock exchange growth; we are looking at the laws that will enhance investment. That is our concern,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mboya said the Dar es Salaam bourse would be housed on a former hotel building just vacated by government tax officers.</p>
<p>The authority had identified Tanzania Breweries and Tanzania Cigarette Company and two oil companies and two cement companies as the first to be listed when the bourse opens, Mboya said.</p>
<p>That listing would begin with a government flotation of 25 percent of its stake. Depending on the results, the government had pledged to offload all its shareholding in public companies in good time, Mboya added.</p>
<p>&quot;We have finished working on listing rules, so there is a regulatory framework in place. We are now inviting private companies to get listed to help us along,&quot; Mboya said.</p>
<p>Mboya was in Nairobi to attend a meeting called by capital markets chiefs in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania to discuss developments in the region in view of enhanced efforts by their presidents towards renewed East African economic cooperation.</p>
<p>Ugandan officials say they too have overcome their problems and will open their own long-delayed bourse by mid-December.</p>
<p>The Nairobi Stock Exchange is the region's only bourse. It is capitalised at $1.89 billion. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is by far Africa's largest.</p>
<p>The Dar es Salaam bourse is the latest capitalist institution in a country formerly strongly committed to socialist policies. -- Nairobi Newsroom ++254-2 330-261</p>
