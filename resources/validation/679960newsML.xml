<p>Tests on the wreckage of a helicopter in which the son of Argentine President Carlos Menem died in March 1995 show the crash could have been caused by a bullet, a forensic expert said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;In the wreckage of the helicopter ... there are holes and the forensic tests will determine what caused those holes, which could be a sharp metal object or a bullet,&quot; Fede Yolanda Cespedes, vice president of the Argentine Criminology Association, said.</p>
<p>Association experts are carrying out tests on the wreckage that should be concluded by Friday and delivered to the courts, Cespedes told Reuters. She said evidence she had seen so far made her think the helicopter piloted by 26-year-old Carlos Menem Jr. smashed into high-voltage wires and crashed after being hit by sniper fire.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that it was not an accident,&quot; Cespedes said by telephone from her home in the city of Santa Fe.</p>
<p>The association was asked to carry out tests by Carlos Jr's mother, Zulema Yoma, who insists publicly her son was murdered in foul play linked to politics or drug trafficking.</p>
<p>Government officials have ridiculed the claims by Yoma, who is divorced from the president. They have also insisted that the president's son was carrying just one passenger, his racing driver friend Silvio Oltra, when they both died.</p>
<p>But Cespedes said there was overwhelming evidence of a third passenger. &quot;There are about 30 people who saw and have testified that they say the body of a woman&quot; in the wreckage.</p>
<p>Carlos Jr's sister Zulemita recently said on television that her brother had told her he was going to make the fatal trip with Oltra and a woman.</p>
<p>Cespedes said investigators thought the dead woman was a foreigner who had entered the country illegally, because of a lack of records of her identity and because no one came forward to claim her remains.</p>
<p>&quot;It is strange that first (the death of the woman) should have been concealed (in the first investigation) and secondly that no one should have come forward to claim her,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Cespedes charged that the initial investigation into the crash was marred by irregularities including a failure to keep all of the helicopter wreckage under control of the courts.</p>
<p>An autopsy on Carlos Jr's body in October showed no evidence he was under the influence of drugs and said he died of a fractured skull in the crash. His body was exhumed at the insistance of his mother.</p>
