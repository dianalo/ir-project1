<p>Pakistani authorities said on Thursday they had arrested the father-in-law of ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto and a former minister in an apparent toughening of a controversial anti-corruption drive.</p>
<p>Hakim Ali Zardari, father of Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari, was picked up overnight from his home in the southern port city of Karachi, a police official said.</p>
<p>Nawaz Khokhar, who was science and technology minister in Bhutto's dismissed cabinet, was arrested in the Punjab province capital of Lahore on Thursday from the premises of the provincial high court, the official APP news agency said.</p>
<p>There was no immediate information about the exact charges against the two men. But police sources said the two would be interrogated by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) police.</p>
<p>However, the official APP news agency said Zardari, who is a candidate for parliament in the general elections set for February 3, was arrested in connection with a land scam.</p>
<p>The two arrests follow speculation in local newspapers that caretaker Prime Minister Meraj Khalid's government might get tough in the coming days in its anti-corruption drive.</p>
<p>Khalid's two-month-old government, which has only a month of its tenure left, has come under increasing criticism for allegedly failing to bring any concrete proof of corruption charges that President Farooq Leghari had cited for dismissing Bhutto's three-year-old government on November 5.</p>
<p>The News newspaper said on Thursday the FIA was planning to raid the houses of some more politicians and arrest some high government officials.</p>
<p>Zardari's son Asif, who was investment minister in his wife's cabinet, is already under arrest since Bhutto's sacking.</p>
<p>A court in Karachi on Thursday extended Asif's jail custody until Saturday on the request of an investigating police officer questioning him about the alleged murder of Bhutto's estranged brother Murtaza in September.</p>
<p>Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) on Thursday criticised the caretaker government for arresting the elder Zardari and said the move was meant to victimise political opponents.</p>
<p>A PPP statement said Zardari was a party nominee for the National Assembly seat from his home district of Nawabshah in the southern province of Sindh and his arrest was part of a plan to deprive the PPP of &quot;winning candidates&quot;.</p>
<p>It called the arrest &quot;state persecution&quot; against political opponents and said not a single charge had so far been filed against Zardari.</p>
<p>Khokhar's arrest was his third since Bhutto's sacking. He was first arrested in mid-November under a catch-all Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance. He was released by a court later, to be re-arrested against in a land scam, and was released on bail on Deceber 25.</p>
