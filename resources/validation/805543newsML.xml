<p>Telecommunications and network systems integrator Datacraft Asia Ltd said it would combine internal business growth, joint ventures and acquisitions to keep revenue and profits rising at double-digit rates.</p>
<p>&quot;With a balanced growth strategy of organic growth, joint ventures and acquisitions, we expect to grow at a 40 percent rate,&quot; for 1997/1998, Des Althorp, the group's chief executive officer and managing director told a news briefing on Monday.  </p>
<p>Datacraft projects both revenue and profit before tax would grow by about 40 percent for the year ending June 30, 1998, higher than the 35 percent it previously forecast.</p>
<p>For the year ended June 30, 1997, Datacraft's net profit jumped 54.8 percent to US$10.34 million on turnover of US$143.3 million, above analysts' consensus net profit forecast of S$14.2 million (US$9.4 million).</p>
<p>Althorp said the company was likely to form joint ventures to enter the Korean and Japanese markets and looking at opportunities in Vietnam.  </p>
<p>Datacraft's core business segments are providing network equipment and infrastructure to telecoms service providers and large corporations, and services and support.</p>
<p>&quot;The disappearing (telecommunications) monopoly gives us lots of opportunities to service new licences,&quot; Althorp said.</p>
<p>Datacraft was looking at new access network technology that would enable higher-speed inputs from operators, Althorp said.</p>
<p>Services were Datacraft's fasted growing area and a high margin business, which contributed 25 percent of pretax profit and 19 percent of revenue, he said.  </p>
<p>Datacraft was aiming at services contributing 20 percent of revenue and 40 percent each from network business from telecoms service providers and corporations in three years' time.</p>
<p>Datacraft was looking to acquire more small to medium-sized companies with revenues of US$10-15 million as &quot;an insurance against any unforeseen circumstances,&quot; Althorp said.</p>
<p>Such acquisitions would help it grow market share and acquire skills, he said.</p>
<p>On the currency turmoil in Asia, Althorp said most of the group's contracts were in U.S. currency and it was trying to make major contracts U.S.-dollar-based.  </p>
<p>&quot;We also have now currency fluctuation clauses in our contracts,&quot; he said, adding that prices would be increased if a currency moved more than five percent.</p>
<p>He said Thailand was a challenging market for Datacraft because customers had budget constraints and the economy was facing financial problems. But he still expected business in Thailand to grow this fiscal year.</p>
<p>Datacraft would also be raising capital to fund previous acquisitions and for working capital by the end of this year, Althorp said.  </p>
<p>Ron Cattell, Datacraft's executive director, told Reuters the company was looking at raising US$30-50 million.</p>
