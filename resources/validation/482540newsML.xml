<p>The speaker of India's lower house of parliament, P.A. Sangma, said on Wednesday that the budget for 1997/98 (April-March) can be passed even if the government fails to win a vote of confidence next week.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a precedent that even after the resignation of the government, the budget has been taken up,&quot; Sangma told reporters at Parliament House.  </p>
<p>The market-friendly budget presented on February 28 was suddenly called into question on Sunday after the Congress party withdrew its make-or-break support for Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's United Front coalition.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda will seek a confidence vote on April 11, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Srikanta Jena said earlier on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda's United Front coalition leaders said on Tuesday that they were exploring the possibility of trying to push the path-breaking budget, which would slash corporate and personal tax rates, through parliament before the trust vote.</p>
<p>Sangma said it was up to government to decide when the budget would be put to a vote in parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;No. It is for the government to decide,&quot; Sangma said, when asked if he was trying to call a meeting of political parties to find ways to approve the budget.  </p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has talked with Sangma on telephone and said coalition leaders were discussing ways to get the budget approved in parliament, the house speaker said.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not foresee any crisis on the budget,&quot; Sangma said, adding that leaders of all political parties were responsible.</p>
<p>Many lawmakers have met Sangma and expressed concern over the fate of the budget, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that the vote on account has been passed which will be valid up to end-May, the budget has to be passed before the end of May unless another vote on account is passed,&quot; Sangma said.</p>
<p>Last month the lower house approved a bill, called a vote on account, providing for continued appropriation of money to fund government programmes until the 1997/98 (April-March) budget was approved.</p>
