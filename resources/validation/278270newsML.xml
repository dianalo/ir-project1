<p>British house prices rose by more than eight percent on average this year and are forecast to rise by around seven percent in 1997, the Nationwide Building Society said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Nationwide said house prices are now 8.3 percent higher than in the final quarter of 1995 and 8.5 percent higher in December than December a year ago. The building society forecast house prices would rise by around seven percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Housing transactions totalled about 1.23 million in 1996, seven percent more than in 1995. The Nationwide forecast the total would leap by around 15 percent to 1.4 million next year.</p>
<p>&quot;1996 saw a substantial improvement in the housing market, although this was from a low base, and we expect further growth into 1997 and beyond,&quot; said Philip Williamson, Nationwide's marketing and commercial director.</p>
<p>Parts of London and the South East will see faster house price inflation, of 10 percent or more, next year.</p>
<p>The bulk of households blighted by negative equity -- where the value of a property is worth less than the mortgage taken out on it -- should be eliminated over the next two years, the Nationwide said.</p>
<p>In 1996, the number of households affected fell to about 800,000 from 1.7 million at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now seeing a soundly-based recovery, underpinned by excellent affordability and higher levels of confidence,&quot; Williamson said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect more existing homeowners to enter the market next year and this is likely to lead to higher sales as supply bottlenecks ease and deferred purchases from the early 1990s begin to impact on the market.&quot;</p>
