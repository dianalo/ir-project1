<text>
<p>The Nairobi Stock Exchange 20-share index edged up 9.41 points on Tuesday to close at 3466.33 on good volumes traded at the bourse's special boards.</p>
<p>Turnover was posted at 32.159 million shillings on 640,610 shares from 9.633 million shillings on 188,533 shares on Friday.</p>
<p>Out of these, 112,700 shares of Sasini Tea &amp; Coffee were traded on the three-day special board at a reserve price of 73 from 60 and 59,900 shares of National Industrial Credit were traded at 52 from 50.</p>
<p>Brokers and bourse officials said Tuesday was characterised by strong demand for blue chips from foreign investors, who resurfaced having kept a low profile over the last three weeks.</p>
<p>They bought Kenya Power and Lighting at 108 from 107, and Kenya Commercial Bank at between 87.50 and 90 from 85, Kenya Breweries at 53 unchanged and Kakuzi at 100 from 98.</p>
<p>Analysts said the increasing presence of foreign investors in the market reflected a general trend by international investment funds to increase their spread in emerging Africa outside South Africa.</p>
<p>A broker added that hesitant trading ahead of Kenya's general election this year was also contributing to increased foreign demand as prices were reasonably low and good for long-term investors</p>
<p>He said of particular interest to foreign investors were companies whose products had a strong local market as losses due to fluctuations in the shilling exchange rate were minimised.</p>
<p>Oil concern Total Kenya traded at 85 from 87.50, while Rea Vipingo closed at 11 from 10.80. The agricultural firm announced a dividend of 1.70 shillings on Friday last week.</p>
