<p>German industrial production rose 1.4 percent in December from the month before, the economics ministry reported on Tuesday, and analysts said the rise was stronger than expected.</p>
<p>But they cautioned the figure was likely to be revised, and most said it did not change their view that the economy was sluggish in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Consensus expectations were for a rise of about 0.7 percent in industrial output from November.</p>
<p>The December index was 3.3 percent higher than a year earlier, according to Bundesbank data.</p>
<p>Uwe Angenendt of BHF Bank said the December data were &quot;surprisingly strong figures but they should be treated with caution because they contain many estimates.</p>
<p>November industrial output increases were revised down to 0.9 percent month-on-month and 0.7 percent year-on-year from initial estimates of 1.6 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think (the December data) will lead to a correction of the 1.4 percent German GDP rise reported for 1996,&quot; Angenendt said.</p>
<p>&quot;The November data have been revised down strongly so overall there is an unchanged picture of economic stagnation or a minor contraction in the fourth quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>Trinkaus Capital Management saidin a research note that the data would not give the Bundesbank any reason to change its monetary policy course.</p>
<p>Mathias Haffner of Barclays de Zoete Wedd added: &quot;The rise was driven by construction and mining rather than manufacturing and it would be better if it were the other way round.&quot;</p>
<p>The construction sector boosted outputby 6.9 percent in December, while the mining sector showed a 4.1 percent rise.</p>
<p>The ministry said the timing of Christmas on a Wednesday, which made it easy to take a longer holiday by &quot;bridging&quot; to the weekend, made the December data uncertain.</p>
<p>Overall production rose 1.1 percent in west Germany in December, while in east Germany it rose 4.5 percent.</p>
<p>The Federal Statistics Office later said German industrial production declined an average 1.1 percent in 1996 from the year before. In 1995, industrial production rose an average 1.6 percent, the office said.</p>
<p>Weakness in the construction sector was the main factor behind the 1996 drop, the office said. Manufacturing output was nearly flat, showing a 0.1 percent decline, but construction output fell nearly 10 percent, it said.</p>
