<title>NEW ZEALAND: CRICKET-SRI LANKA IN DEEPER TROUBLE AT LUNCH.</title>
<headline>CRICKET-SRI LANKA IN DEEPER TROUBLE AT LUNCH.</headline>

<p>Sri Lanka suffered more setbacks on the third morning of the first cricket test against New Zealand at Carisbrook on Sunday.</p>
<p>The tourists were precariously placed at 150 for seven in their first innings at the lunch break in pursuit of New Zealand's mammoth 586 for seven declared.</p>
<p>The Sri Lankans need to score a further 237 runs just to avoid the follow on.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka resumed play already in trouble at 78 for four and their position quickly deteriorated after only one run was added when skipper Arjuna Ranatunga followed a wide delivery from fast-medium bowler Simon Doull only to edge the ball to Bryan Young at second slip.</p>
<p>Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana did not lose heart, hitting out boldly to score 43 and take the tourists total through to 135 when he was out in bizarre circumstances.</p>
<p>He leaned forward to defend a delivery from offspinner Dipak Patel and the ball became jammed between the gloves and the top flap of his front pad.</p>
<p>Kaluwitharana remained stationary for several seconds and Stephen Fleming, fielding in close, rushed in and grabbed the ball before it fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Umpire Ian Robinson, of Zimbabwe, adjudged Kaluwitharana out caught by Fleming.</p>
<p>The third wicket to fall in the morning session was that of Chaminda Vaas who drove Patel uppishly to mid-on where Matt Horne accepted a comfortable catch.</p>
<p>Doull was the most successful bowler, on four for 55, while Patel had two for 30 and Heath Davis one for 33.</p>
