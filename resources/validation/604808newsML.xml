<p>After his triumphant takeover of Kinshasa, Laurent Kabila now seems to face problems with the task of forming a government for his Democractic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>The self-declared president of ex-Zaire missed his latest deadline on Thursday for announcing a team to take charge after toppling former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko's 32-year rule.</p>
<p>A new administration has been expected since Tuesday following Saturday's capture of the capital by Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL).</p>
<p>There was also no sign of a planned meeting between Kabila and populist opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, whose supporters are demanding a role in the new state.</p>
<p>Kabila has been cloistered with key associates in the prime minister's residence since arriving in Kinshasa unnanounced on Tuesday night. A close aide said a new government would be announced on state television at 1930 GMT but the deadline lasped without official explanation.</p>
<p>A studio had been pr%pared at state television for the announcement but there was no sign of Kabila's information commissioner Raphael Gbenda who said he would unveil the team.</p>
<p>State television said an announcement was still expected.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi's fanatical followers have been campaigining for a role for their hero, even threatening street marches if he were not made prime minister in Kabila's government.</p>
<p>Hundreds of militants have been virtually camping in solidarity outside Tshisekedi's home. Their leaders worked the crowd to a frenzy on Thursday with speeches reminding Kabila that their own campaign paved the way for last Saturday's overthrow of Mobutu, who is now in Togo.</p>
<p>&quot;We put Mobutu in a political ambulance and the AFDL took him to the cemetery,&quot; declared Tshisekedi's close associate Joseph Olengankoy.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether the delay in coming up with a new government was linked to Tshisekedi's position.</p>
<p>State television meanwhile announced another military triumph for Kabila's alliance forces -- the capture of the country's only seaport of Matadi on the Atlantic near Angola.</p>
<p>The guerrillas who began their long trek across Zaire from the shores of Lake Kivu last October took Matadi &quot;without meeting any resistance&quot;, the TV said. It did not say when.</p>
<p>Matadi is also a rail terminal located close to the former Zaire's only refinery and the huge Inga hydro-electric dam. It was the only major city not yet under control of Kabila's guerrillas.</p>
<p>Many former soldiers loyal to Mobutu were reported fleeing towards Matadi. Officials in Angola said on Thursday about 25,000 people, including armed men, had crossed over from Kabila's Congo.</p>
<p>In a sign of growing international acceptance of the new regime, the United Nations said it had been officially told that Kinshasa's envoy now represented Kabila, and would comply with a letter informing it that the country was reviving the name, flag and anthem it had on independence from Belgium in June 1960.</p>
<p>The European Union said it hoped for a broad-based transitional government and would send a mission to convey its views to Kabila.</p>
<p>Western powers have catiously voiced backing for Kabila, linking full recognition and economic aid to progress on broad-based democratic rule.</p>
