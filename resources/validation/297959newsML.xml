<headline>Taiwan, China to renew talks on shipping links.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-01-09</dateline>

<p>Officials and shipping executives from Taiwan and China will meet in Hong Kong on January 22 for the second round of talks on direct links between the island and the mainland, a local newspaper said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Commercial Times, a leading business newspaper, said the two sides were also expected to discuss inaugural direct shipping links between Taiwan's southern Kaohsiung and China's southeastern Xiamen and Fuzhou.</p>
<p>The sides hoped to start the direct shipping links in the first quarter of 1997, the paper added.</p>
<p>Hsieh Ming-hui, department head of navigation and aviation under the Ministry of Transportation and Communication, was expected to join the discussion with his Chinese counterpart, it said.</p>
<p>But officials and shipping executives declined to comment.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not authoritized to reveal any details,&quot; a shipping association executive said by telephone.</p>
<p>An aide to Hsieh said Hsieh has not made any travel arrangements to Hong Kong so far.</p>
<p>To fulfil its ambition of becoming an Asia-Pacific business hub, Taiwan proposed in 1995 to set up an offshore transshipment centre at southern Kaohsiung port from which ships would be allowed to sail directly between Taiwan and China.</p>
<p>The project has been delayed by sovereignty issues.</p>
<p>On August 20 1996, China unveiled rules governing direct shipping links across the Taiwan strait, effective immediately, but Taiwan gave a cool response, saying Beijing's rules were &quot;mingled with sensitive political issues&quot;.</p>
<p>Taiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists lost a civil war to the Chinese communists and fled to the island in 1949.</p>
<p>With tensions easing since the late 1980s, civilian aircraft and vessels have skirted the ban by stopping over in a third country or territory such as the British colony of Hong Kong or Portuguese-run Macau.</p>
<p>Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, has pressured the government to estabilish such links to save transportation costs.</p>
