<p>Pope John Paul will call for co-existence and forgiveness in Bosnia at the weekend when he makes a historic visit to its capital Sarajevo, scarred by siege and a war driven by ethnic and religious hatreds.</p>
<p>Senior Vatican officials said the 25-hour visit to the city, now mainly Moslem, would also test the Dayton peace deal that ended the conflict in 1995 in the extent to which Roman Catholic Croats were able to reach Sarajevo to see their Pope.</p>
<p>&quot;The themes of the visit are solidarity and hope but hope is only possible if forgiveness is offered and received,&quot; one Vatican prelate familiar with the visit said.</p>
<p>The trip, whose main event will be an open-air mass on Sunday at Sarajevo's Kosevo soccer stadium, is likely to be one of the most emotional in recent years of a papacy dogged by declining health and advancing age.</p>
<p>It comes at a time of tensions in the shaky Bosnian federation between Croats and Moslems, with little sign that the ethnic separation wrought by their conflict and their war with Orthodox Serbs has been diminished by peace.</p>
<p>Fears for the 76-year-old Pope's security have been fuelled by a wave of attacks on churches and mosques over the past two months. A monastery and a church in central Sarajevo were among the targets of the attacks, none of which caused injuries.</p>
<p>Authorities in the capital say they will deploy thousands of local police for the visit. United Nations police and NATO forces have said they will provide support.</p>
<p>&quot;As Successor of Peter, I am going to confirm in faith our brothers and sisters in a city which, in a certain sense, has become a sad symbol of the tragedies which have struck Europe in the 20th century,&quot; the Pope said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;May this Apostolic Visit also become a voyage of peace on which the Church bears witness to its solidarity with suffering men and peoples,&quot; he said at his weekly general audience.</p>
<p>The Vatican welcomed the Dayton deal in as far as it halted the bloodshed but Vatican officials say they believe it also &quot;consecrated&quot; the ethnic cleansing perpetrated by all sides.</p>
<p>Sarajevo had a pre-war population of 50,000 Catholics but the number is now down to 20,000, according to Church sources.</p>
<p>Most Croats in Bosnia are now concentrated in the western Herzegovina region, with hardly any in areas of northern Bosnia around the Serb stronghold of Banja Luka. Many are expected to try to reach Sarajevo by bus across ethnic dividing lines.</p>
<p>&quot;If the presence of the Pope allows a truce of God to let people through then the trip itself will have contributed to reinforcing the Dayton accords,&quot; one Vatican official said.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be a test of reconstruction and freedom of movement,&quot; one Vatican official said.</p>
<p>The Bosnian conflict and the Serb siege of Sarajevo were constant themes of the Polish-born Pope's addresses for much of the past four years.</p>
<p>During the war, he condemned religious bigotry and nationalism and since the peace has frequently urged Croats, Moslems and Bosnian Serbs to rebuild co-existence.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pope is the symbol of reconciliation and understanding and in few places is that message as important and as necessary as in Sarajevo,&quot; the international community's High Representative in Bosnia, Carl Bildt, said earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Pope had planned to visit Sarajevo in 1994, while war was still raging, but cancelled the trip when Bosnian Serbs besieging the city said they could not guarantee his safety.</p>
<p>This time, however, the visit has the support of all three members of Bosnia-Herzegovina's new collective presidency, including Serb representative Momcilo Krajisnik.</p>
<p>The Pope, who leaves Rome on Saturday, is due to meet Bosnian leaders and representatives of other religious groups.</p>
<p>The trip is the Pope's first since an appendix operation last October since when he has cut back on some of his public engagements. He is due to go later this month to Prague and also has trips this year to Lebanon, Poland, France and Brazil.</p>
