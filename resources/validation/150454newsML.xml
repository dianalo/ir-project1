<p>Prayers and embraces kept two women alive after they were trapped beneath the mountain of rubble of a collapsed Cairo apartment block.</p>
<p>Rescue workers pulled out Egyptian Noha Fawzi and her American friend Samantha Miksche alive on Tuesday, 36 hours after the 11-storey building caved in on top of its residents on Sunday night. Both women are suffering minor abrasions and Miksche is heavily sedated.</p>
<p>&quot;We were seperated by some rocks and I would give her my hand for comfort,&quot; Fawzi, 20, told Reuters from hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;We would recite Koran, pray. You almost die 1,000 times in one second. It was awful. Just awful,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Twenty people are confirmed dead and about 90 other people are feared buried beneath the debris.</p>
<p>Rescuers and doctors say time is running out for any survivors and many corpses have been coming out decomposed -- a sign that there is no air flowing through the fallen concrete slabs and twisted metal that remain of the building.</p>
<p>Fawzi said she had been showing Miksche and her mother a flat in the building, located in the northern Cairo suburb of Heliopolis, when she felt the walls coming down on her.</p>
<p>&quot;I was showing them the flat, it's my uncle's flat, they wanted to rent it for a while and it took exactly 10 minutes and it collapsed,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;We prayed and every time we heard the rescuers we would scream. Then today morning we heard them really close so we screamed even louder and they took us out.</p>
<p>&quot;But Samantha's mother is still there, and my aunt and cousin too. I thank god that I am safe but there's something inside me that just won't go away -- my aunt and my cousin. I know nothing about them. I wait,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>A friend of Miksche told Reuters earlier that it was Samantha's aunt and cousin that were in the flat.</p>
<p>&quot;Samantha told me that she was very scared and that she felt she was going to die... she just sat there with Noha and prayed to be saved,&quot; said Heba Mandour, one of Miksche's cousins.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to hear news about her mother,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Rescuers have so far dug out 24 survivors from the debris and are using sniffer dogs and noise detection equipment to search for the missing.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying but time is running out. The time frame is 60 hours after a disaster for pulling out living persons. All the people are working very hard,&quot; German Red Cross worker Rolf Bartmann told Reuters.</p>
<p>Authorities said additional floors had illegally been added to the building and are questioning the owner but the building's porter said he thought renovation work in one of its 40 apartments might have destabilised the structure.</p>
<p>Egyptian rescue workers, joined by seven German volunteers, have been tirelessly scouring the rubble for signs of life.</p>
<p>Claus Ropper, also from the German volunteer team, said he thought the building had listed to the left and that people located to the right and centre might have been saved from being crushed to death.</p>
<p>But rescuers were removing more corpses than survivors on Tuesday as anguished relatives scrutinised the mountainous rubble pile for signs of their kin.</p>
<p>Soaring Cairo real estate prices have often pushed landlords to add extra floors to their properties illegally.</p>
<p>Several buildings have collapsed beneath the extra weight and recent earthquakes have also taken their toll on poorly constructed buildings in the crowded capital.</p>
