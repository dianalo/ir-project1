<p>Just over a year ago, Bruno Kernen toyed with the idea of retiring from Alpine skiing after being sidelined by injury.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the 24-year-old Swiss stole the limelight at the world championships by winning the men's blue riband downhill race -- only two days after taking combined silver.</p>
<p>But despite his successes, which gave his ski-crazed nation their first gold medal in four years, Kernen remained his usual calm and collected self.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like being called a star. I heard that word already last year after I won the (back-to-back World Cup) downhills in Veysonnaz.</p>
<p>&quot;People expected so much from me after that and I was unable to live up to expectations,&quot; said Kernen. &quot;Who knows if I will be able to live up to them now?&quot;</p>
<p>The last Swiss downhill champion was Urs Lehmann who seems to have disappeared as fast as he emerged.</p>
<p>Kernen first got himself noticed in 1993, when he posted his first World Cup top 10 result on the same Kandahar Banchetta piste in Sestriere which brought him glory this week.</p>
<p>Before that, the Bruno Kernen most people knew was his unrelated Swiss namesake who won at Kitzbuehel in 1983.</p>
<p>A serious knee injury sustained in a World Cup race in Valloire at the beginning of the 1993/94 season, kept Bruno II, as he is sometimes known, off the slopes for almost two years.</p>
<p>During this time, Kernen succeeded in completing the first half of his studies in achitectural engineering, but his fight back to the elite of ski racing was tough and uncertain.</p>
<p>Shortly before claiming his only two World Cup victories to date in Veysonnaz, Kernen had asked a close friend to help him find a job because he was thinking of quitting ski racing.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't say I almost quit, but I was considering it very seriously,&quot; said Kernen.</p>
<p>Kernen's downhill gold came as a surprise following a weak start to the season due to problems with new ski equipment. He used his old skis in Sestriere.</p>
<p>Kernen's previous performances in world championships had been anything but impressive. He was downhill 16th in 1993 and 17th in both the downhill and super-G last year.</p>
<p>He was almost unable to participate in these championships after a heavy crash during the Wengen downhill last month.</p>
<p>Swiss coach Francois Sedan said Kernen had asked for a doctor to be called later in the evening after the crash because he was feeling faint.</p>
<p>&quot;At the time, I thought we would have a problem at the world championships because Bruno would not be fully fit,&quot; said Sedan.</p>
<p>Instead of taking leave after Wengen, Kernen decided to go to Kitzbuehel the following week to compete in the most dreaded and demanding downhill on the Streif piste.</p>
<p>&quot;I was very lucky that I recuperated so quickly after Wengen. I insisted on going to Kitzbuehel because I thought that would be the only way to regain my confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;It did help. Every downhill run I have done since then has been a small piece of a mosaic which has allowed me to get this far,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kernen will have a chance of adding a third medal to his new collection at next Saturday's night slalom.</p>
<p>&quot;There was one place left in our slalom team which I got because of my good performance in the combined slalom,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kernen posted the third best combined slalom time, although he had trained for only three days for it before coming to Sestriere.</p>
