<p>Nasionale Pers Ltd would invest over 215 million rand in its newspaper division over the next year to keep pace with new information technology developments, chairman and managing director Ton Vosloo said on Friday.</p>
<p>He also said he would relinquish his dual role in October and hand over the reins of managing director to associate pay-TV company MIH Holdings Ltd chief executive Koos Bekker.</p>
<p>Vosloo said the group valued its stable of mainly Afrikaans language newspapers highly and would initiate &quot;sweeping innovations&quot; yet in this division.</p>
<p>&quot;These will cost more than the 215 million rand we spent on the printing works for the magazines division in the past 18 months.</p>
<p>&quot;This will be done in the knowledge that new technologies are changing the rules of the game as we know it,&quot; Vosloo said.</p>
<p>He said that although publishers had despaired in recent years about the future of newspapers, they had unequivocally confirmed their faith in the industry at the recent conference of the World Association of Newspapers in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>But this meant that newspaper groups had to gear up to the challenges posed by the fact that information was now being disseminated more rapidly than before because of the introduction of digital processes.</p>
<p>Vosloo said the new printing works for group magazines would be completed by September but the presses were already running and circulation losses due to past lack of capacity were being clawed back.</p>
<p>He said the group as a whole had made a good start to its new financial year.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic conditions in the country are reasonable, despite the high interest rates which affect the public's disposable income,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Stiff budgets were adopted by our divisions and so far expectations have been met. Management's mission is to beat inflation realistically over a five-year cycle.&quot;</p>
