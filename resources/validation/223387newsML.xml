<p>U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry is set to return to the Gulf on Thursday night to discuss military measures to deter Iraq, Iran's ambitious rearmament programme and threats to American troops in the region.</p>
<p>Perry starts his tour in Kuwait to discuss the size and length of the deployment of U.S. forces, diplomats said.</p>
<p>He will later visit the USS aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, Qatar -- where Washington has arms prepositioned for immediate deployment in case of a crisis -- and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>U.S. officers in Kuwait told Reuters their assignment comes up for review in December.</p>
<p>Some 3,000 ground troops, eight Stealth bombers and other weapons were rushed to Kuwait in September to join 1,200 ground forces deployed there to deter what officials called renewed Iraqi threats in a fresh standoff with Baghdad.</p>
<p>Kuwait said this week that former occupier Iraq continued to pose a threat to its security and that military cooperation with Western powers was needed to check Baghdad.</p>
<p>Perry is also due to discuss the outcome of investigations into a truck bomb attack that killed 19 American airmen in Saudi Arabia in June.</p>
<p>Elaborate security measures were introduced for U.S. forces in Kuwait and throughout the region after the bombing.</p>
<p>Four Saudis were beheaded for an attack last November in Riyadh in which five Americans and two Indians were killed but diplomatic sources say Saudi Arabia now believes that a well- organised network was behind the second attack.</p>
<p>They say it had arrested some 40 suspects in connection to the June bombing, including a man suspected of driving the truck which exploded at a military residential complex. with Saudi officials and various theories of responsibility.</p>
<p>Perry is also expected to discuss with Gulf Arab officials the growing military might of the region's non-Arab power Iran which is due to take delivery next month of a third Russian submarine.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said Gulf states were interested to hear the outcome of talks this week by U.S. President Bill Clinton in Beijing on China's military ties with Iran which U.S. officials said included the sale of nuclear technology and missiles.</p>
<p>The six Gulf Arab states in June changed their usual cautious tone when addresing their much larger neighbour Iran.</p>
<p>Sounding more like Washington, they said Iran's plans &quot;far exceed conventional and legitimate defence needs&quot; and posed a threat to a region with 70 percent of the world's oil reserves.</p>
<p>Iran shares the Gulf's only entrance, the narrow Strait of Hormuz through which 15 million barrels of oil pass every day, with Gulf Arab Oman.</p>
