<p>The Russian military has de-targeted nuclear missiles aimed at Japan in accordance with a promise made by President Boris Yeltsin to Tokyo earlier this month, Interfax news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying the defence ministry had carried out appropriate instructions from the president.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky gave no further details while the defence ministry was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, keen to improve icy relations with Tokyo, soured since World War Two by a bitter territorial dispute, announced to Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto last week that Russia would de-target missiles aimed at Japan and China.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's pledge, made at the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Denver last week, was coupled with an agreement that the two countries should hold regular summit meetings and establish telephone hotlines.</p>
<p>In a sign of outstanding problems Japan coast guards said on Thursday an unidentified ship had fired on a Japanese fishing boat, wounding two crew members, one seriously.</p>
<p>Russian officials for their part accused Japanese vessels of poaching in the Russian waters and said Russian border guards shot at the poachers trying to stop them. They said nothing about casualties.</p>
<p>A Russian foreign ministry spokesman said Thursday's incident, which is not unusual in the waters separating two countries, could harm the improving bilateral relations.</p>
<p>Japan has refused to sign a formal peace treaty with Moscow, demanding the return of the southern Kurile islands seized by the Soviet army in the last days of World War Two. The two countries normalised relations in 1956.</p>
<p>The removal of China and Japan from Russia's list of nuclear targets appears largely a goodwill gesture since Moscow could quickly retarget the missiles.</p>
<p>Yeltsin promised last month to de-target Russian missiles aimed at NATO states after Moscow signed a document outlining its new relations with the Western alliance and effectively giving the green light to NATO's expansion eastwards.</p>
