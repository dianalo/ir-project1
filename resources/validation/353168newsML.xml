<p>The Treasury and Transportation departments urged Congress Tuesday to quickly reimpose a 10 percent airline ticket tax, but several major airlines said the levy should be replaced with user fees.</p>
<p>Money from the tax is used to pay for airport and air traffic control system improvements through the Airport and Airways Trust Fund. The law imposing the tax expired at the end of 1996, and officials from the two departments said the fund would soon run out of money unless Congress acted.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless Congress acts promptly to reinstate the taxes, the impact on the Federal Aviation Administration, particularly its capital programs, will be imminent and severe,&quot; Assistant Transportation Secretary Louise Stoll told a Senate Finance Committee hearing. She said the capital funding program could run out of money as early as March.</p>
<p>Assistant Treasury Secretary Donald Lubick added that $1.2 billion in ticket taxes collected by the airlines in 1996 but not sent to the Treasury until last month could not be transferred to the fund without new authority from Congress.</p>
<p>Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, a Delaware Republican, said he would ask the panel to approve a bill to authorize the transfer authority Wednesday while considering other legislation to address the fund's long-term problems.</p>
<p>&quot;The necessary revenue should be raised in a way that is fair to the passengers and to the companies competing in the commercial air transportation industry,&quot; Roth said.</p>
<p>Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, whose panel has jurisdiction over the Transportation Department and FAA, backed extension of the ticket tax, saying its lapse jeopardized air safety.</p>
<p>&quot;On a side note, I am dismayed by reports that several airlines increased fares to match the lapse in the 10 percent passenger ticket tax,&quot; added McCain, an Arizona Republican.</p>
<p>But Northwest Airlines Executive Vice President Michael Levine said the ticket tax was unfair and should be abolished. He testified on behalf of Northwest Airlines Corp., AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, Continental Airlines Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc., TWA, United Airlines, USAir Group Inc. and the Regional Airline Association.</p>
<p>&quot;Our coalition advocates that Congress scrap the inefficient, outmoded and unfair 10 percent ticket sales tax and substitute a usage-based funding mechanism that bases payments by users of the federal air traffic control system on the services they actually use,&quot; Levine said in his statement.</p>
<p>Levine said passengers who fly on uncongested routes often pay more in ticket taxes than those who travel between major cities where air traffic control costs are greater.</p>
