<title>SPAIN: BBV increases provisions for bad debts.</title>
<headline>BBV increases provisions for bad debts.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1996-10-21</dateline>

<p>Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya has increased net provisions for doubtful debts to 60.4 billion pesetas in the first nine months of 1996 from 28.5 billion in the same period last year, a top bank official said on Monday.</p>
<p>This raises its bad debt cover to 100.9 percent while the ratio of doubtful debtors fell 1.10 points to 3.63 percent.</p>
<p>BBV planned to continue putting aside large amounts to cover insolvencies, although the improvement in the economic cycle could lead to a drop in the amount of bad debts at the end of the year, the bank official said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The analyses on economic activity are positive,&quot; he said. &quot;We expect an acceleration in the second half of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>The banking group's financial margin grew 18.3 percent to 303.9 billion pesetas, while financial products and costs grew by the same amount.</p>
<p>Margins were squeezed by a drop in interest rates but this was compensated by the increasing contribution of stakes in Latin America whose results were attributable to the group and by the strict control of debt costs, BBV said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Financial participations in Peru, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina contributed around four percent of the group's profits and 11 percent to the balance sheet.</p>
<p>BBV predicts Latin American business should be a good contributor to growth in the next two or three years and this will compensate for lower profits from financial operations in the light of a different interest rate situation.</p>
<p>BBV has qualified to bid in the privatisation of Banco de Venezuela for which it has offered 275 million dollars and it is studying entering the Brazilian market.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a big project pending which we are in no hurry to complete, and that is Brazil,&quot; said the bank official.</p>
<p>The bank disposes of an excess of 259 billion pesetas of equity capital, he added.</p>
