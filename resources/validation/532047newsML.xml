<headline>Taiwan, Hong Hong set shipping talks for May 2.</headline>

<p>Taiwan said on Wednesday its negotiators were scheduled to go to Hong Kong in early May to work on the throny issues on shipping links before the British colony's July 1 takeover by communist China.</p>
<p>&quot;The talks will be held in Hong Kong on May 2,&quot; Lee Ching-ping, spokesman for the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, told journalists.</p>
<p>Taiwan has authorised Chang Liang-jen, the foundation's deputy secretary-general, to hold talks with Hong Kong Shipowners Association chairman George Chao, Beijing's designated negotiator.</p>
<p>Officials from Taiwan's policy-making Mainland Affairs Council and Transport Ministry would take part in the talks.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is the channel through which more than US$30 billion in Taiwan investments have poured into China since the late 1980s when a political thaw allowed unofficial Taiwan-China ties to begin.</p>
<p>Taiwan has warned of painful consequences if no deal is reached over Taiwan's crucial shipping links with Hong Kong -- including a possible halt to bilateral sailings.</p>
<p>A spokesman at the Hong Kong Shipowners' Association on Tuesday also expressed hopes an agreement would be signed soon.</p>
<p>At issue is what flags ships should fly when plying routes between Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-registered ships will fly the Chinese flag above the future Hong Kong flag after China assumes control of the territory on July 1 after more than 150 years of British rule.</p>
<p>Taipei has said it would welcome ships flying the red five-star of the communist People's Republic of China -- but only if Beijing and Hong Kong tolerated vessels that flew the flag of the exiled Republic of China on Taiwan.</p>
<p>China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and refuses to recognise the Republic of China government that has ruled the Nationalist redoubt since losing the mainland in a civil war in 1949 and fleeing to the island.</p>
<p>Taiwan, which has banned direct links with China since 1949, has agreed to allow limited direct shipping with the mainland.</p>
<p>Under its scheme, mainland cargoes are not allowed to enter Taiwan customs, but can be processed at an offshore transshipment centre in the island's southern port of Kaohsiung for onward passage to third countries.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the second ship to sail directly to Taiwan from China in 48 years entered Kaohsiung Harbour complying with a requirement to fly Taiwan's Nationalist Republic of China flag.</p>
<p>The first ship to sail directly to Taiwan reached Kaohsiung on Saturday night without flying the flag.</p>
