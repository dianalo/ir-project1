<p>Australian shares extended their gains in the afternoon to close higher on Friday as modest bargain hunting emerged after Thursday's weakness.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index climbed 15.4 points to 2,362.1.</p>
<p>Brokers said the return of some buying confidence, as investors considered the yields on offer, had led to a stronger showing after Thursday's perverse reaction to the local interest rate reduction and Wall Street's surge.</p>
<p>&quot;It's quite an improvement,&quot; said broker Robert Cameron of brokerage Cameron Securities, adding that the market seemed to be more settled after running ahead of itself ahead of Wednesday's rate cut.</p>
<p>&quot;There was probably an over-reaction ahead of the interest rate cut. People have settled down and adjusted to it and seen there is still some reasonable yields out there.&quot;</p>
<p>Standouts were few, although listed stockbroker McIntosh Securities caught the eye, jumping 15 cents to A$1.25 (US$0.98), its highest level since September 1994, on speculation that U.S. broker Merrill Lynch was eyeing it as a takeover target.</p>
<p>Near term outlook was seen mixed with much dependent on how the local market would weather a Wall Street correcting from its current record levels.</p>
<p>Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about eight to five, while about 31 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
<p>(A$1 = US$0.7840)</p>
