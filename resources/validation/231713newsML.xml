<headline>EP to demand withdrawal of Commission notice.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1996-12-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Parliament is due next week to criticise the way the European Commission is attempting to prise open the European Union market in postal services.</p>
<p>Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has said that if EU telecoms ministers failed by December 31, 1996 to agree to EU rules on liberalising postal services, the Commission would publish a notice setting out how it would apply competition rules to the sector.</p>
<p>The Telecoms Council failed on November 28 to reach agreement and is not due to reconvene until next year.</p>
<p>In a report due to be approved on December 11, Euro-MPs are expected to say they agree with the need to liberalise the EU postal sector soon.</p>
<p>But they will insist the way to achieve this is for the Council to approve the draft directive, COM(95)227, and not for the Commission to take unprecedented unilateral action.</p>
<p>In a draft of the notice published last year, the Commission set out which services could be &quot;reserved&quot; for state post offices, proposed limits on &quot;cross-subsidies&quot; (money from monopoly services used to subsidise competitive ones), and said public postal operators must offer competitors non-discriminatory access to their networks.</p>
<p>The EP report, drafted by French Christian Democrat Georges Bremond d'Ars, argues that the draft notice contradicts the draft directive and should be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Bremond d'Ars also says that publishing the notice would run counter to the Commission's promise to ensure the definitions used in both texts would be identical.</p>
<p>Logically, it cannot do so until the Council and the parliament have agreed on the final form the draft directive will take, he says.</p>
<p>&quot;The length of time (six years) it has taken the Commission to draw up its proposals and drafts cannot today justify excessive haste in adopting a text which, far from regulating competition problems in the postal sector, would merely complicate them,&quot; the report concludes.</p>
