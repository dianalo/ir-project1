<p>France's opposition Socialist party will not hike taxes if it wins a snap parliamentary election but will merely change their distribution, former labour minister Martine Aubry said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not raise taxes,&quot; Aubry, a member of the party's leadership, said in an interview with RTL radio amid campaigning for the May 25-June 1 vote.</p>
<p>&quot;We will simply make a better share-out between income from capital and income from salaries, we will relaunch consumption and we will introduce a new development model,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She accused the centre-right government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe of preparing new austerity to ensure France meets the budget criteria for a single European currency -- a deficit of less than three percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>The government has said that France is on target to meet the Maastricht criteria with its present policies and is not planning any new austerity.</p>
<p>Aubry, daughter of former European Commission president Jacques Delors, said the three percent target &quot;is not the Bible...the treaty itself says that the trend must be taken into account.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If today we don't respect the Maastricht criteria, it's because there is not enough growth, because salaries have been hit, because consumption is falling,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Socialists say they favour the single currency, but not at the price of a new bout of austerity.</p>
<p>Former Socialist party boss Henri Emmanuelli said France would not meet the Maastricht criteria on current economic performance. &quot;That means a new swing to austerity,&quot; he told France Inter radio.</p>
<p>Emmanuelli denied that Socialist conditions for a single currency, including the participation from the start of Italy and Spain, were a way of wooing voters of the Communist party, which opposes the single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't have the impression that France fears the Communist party gripping power or the economy in France,&quot; he said. &quot;Let's be serious. Those are arguments people brought out in the 1970s.&quot;</p>
