<p>Tajikistan's Tursunzade aluminium smelter has operated without interruption despite dramatic armed clashes near the plant.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be better for us if the markets had thought we stopped working,&quot; quipped a senior smelter official in an interview with Reuters at the plant on Friday. &quot;Then the price of aluminium would go up.&quot;</p>
<p>The official, who declined to be named, said the smelter, with a capacity of 500,000 tonnes per year, had continued to operate at its usual 40-45 percent of capacity.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the mutinous commander of the Tajikistan's elite armoured brigade stormed the town where the smelter is based to unseat local strongman Kodir Abdulayev.</p>
<p>While most of the brigade's tanks appeared to have left Tursunzade, 45 km (30 miles) west of the capital Dushanbe, a light armoured vehicle belonging to the unit was posted outside the smelter's gates.</p>
<p>The plant, a forest of steel pipes and smoke stacks at the foot of the snow-capped Tien Shan mountains, has been the object of ogling by rival armed gangs and powerful interests intent on cashing on metal exports, the former Soviet republic's only cash cow besides narcotics and a declining cotton crop.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't have any problems with the raid,' said the cool-headed plant official. &quot;Raw materials were still delivered to the plant.&quot;</p>
<p>But he said stocks of alumina, the raw material used to make aluminium, sourced mainly from Ukraine and Russia, had run low.</p>
<p>Transport costs for the smelter, located thousands of kilometers from markets and in the remote mountainous republic bordering Afghanistan and China, had hit the plant's profits.</p>
<p>&quot;The cost of bringing alumina and sending out metal by rail is very expensive now,' said the official. &quot;When aluminium prices were low last year, it was difficult for us, but costs are starting to level off now.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that despite the smelter's remote location, cheap hydroelectricity made the smelter competitive, although he would not reveal production costs.</p>
<p>He said nearly all metal produced was shipped to Rotterdam.</p>
<p>Quality problems at the plant, a Soviet-built version of France's Pechiney technology, loom, and the smelter is producing lower grades.</p>
<p>For four years, the Tursunzade plant has operated throughout most of Tajikistan's bitter civil war involving the secular government, Islamist opposition guerrillas and assorted free-lance bands.</p>
<p>But despite the republic's reputation for instability - two foreign workers at a Tajik gold mine were held hostage for three weeks last month - the official said the smelter was negotiating with a major Western firm for a $70 million investment package.</p>
<p>He would not name the company but said that if the deal came off, Tursunzade planned to increase production to about 350,000 tonnes per year by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>He also said that the government planned to privatise the plant this year and that the state would retain a majority 51 percent stake.</p>
<p>&quot;The workforce will also get some shares, but the rest will be sold off,' he said.</p>
