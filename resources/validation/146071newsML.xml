<p>About 1,500 civilians held by Sierra Leone rebels for up to four years are hiding in the bush after escaping from guerrilla camps, aid workers said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The British medical charity MERLIN said in a statement the malnourished men, women and children were trying to reach safety after rebel camps where they had been used as slave labour were overrun by local hunters battling the guerrillas.</p>
<p>Most were picking their way in the bush to Blama, 12 miles (18 km) outside the eastern provincial capital Kenema.</p>
<p>&quot;MERLIN which operates in Kenema has already put in place preparation for food, medicines and shelter for about 1,500 people,&quot; said MERLIN's programme coordinator Beth Dunn.</p>
<p>An emergency officer for the World Food Programme said in Freetown that 500 desperate people had managed to reach Blama.</p>
<p>MERLIN's Dunn said some of the more serious cases had been taken to Kenema.</p>
<p>&quot;To date 45 children, one of them as young as seven months, have been admitted to MERLIN's feeding programme in Kenema suffering from severe malnourishment, trauma and shock. In addition it was assessed that 25 percent of the adults were also suffering from severe malnourishment,&quot; Dunn told Reuters.</p>
<p>A ceasefire agreed between the Revolutionary United Front and the Sierra Leone government in March appears to be breaking down progressively as the parties fail to reach a common ground on sealing a comprehensive peace accord to end five years of civil war.</p>
