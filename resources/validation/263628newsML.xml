<title>KENYA: Kenya objects to Zaire comments on summit.</title>
<headline>Kenya objects to Zaire comments on summit.</headline>
<dateline>NAIROBI 1996-12-18</dateline>

<p>Kenya replied sharply to Zaire on Wednesday over claims that a summit on the Great Lakes crisis was organised by English-speaking African leaders dancing to the tune of an unnamed foreign power.</p>
<p>&quot;The claim that the initiative for the meeting is not African smacks of neo-colonial mentality that nothing positive can originate from black Africa,&quot; an official Kenyan statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The truth of the matter is that the summit was convened by President (Daniel arap) Moi of Kenya.&quot;</p>
<p>Monday's Nairobi summit, attended by South Africa's Nelson Mandela and eight other leaders, was boycotted by Zaire. The summit called for a peaceful settlement between President Mobutu Sese Seko's government and the rebels who have seized control of eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>Zaire's information minister, Boguo Makele, told Reuters in Kinshasa on Tuesday the summit was part of an Anglo-Saxon plot aiming to destabilise French-speaking Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;After analysing documents in our possession it seems that the initiative for this meeting is not African and that in effect a foreign power directly implicated in the events in the east is the author of this masquerade,&quot; Boguo added.</p>
<p>Zairean ministers have accused the United States of backing Rwanda, which supports the rebels, with logistical help.</p>
<p>The statement, signed by the senior civil servant in the Kenyan information ministry, said French-speaking Rwanda and Cameroon attended the summit and Zaire turned down its invitation.</p>
<p>&quot;Contrary to the impression given by Mr Makele's sentiments, the summit demonstrates that African countries can, should and indeed must generate home-grown solutions to domestic problems and not, so many decades after independence, wait for direction by Western nations,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The leaders of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe were the other summit participants.</p>
