<headline>Canada invites bids for DBS satellite slots.</headline>
<dateline>OTTAWA 1996-11-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Canadian Industry Minister John Manley on Thursday invited interested Canadian companies to bid for the operation of two satellites in Canada's orbital slot, which will be used for direct broadcast satellite (DBS) television broadcasting.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm inviting all interested parties to come forward with innovative business plans so that we can get the satellite capacity needed by Canadian broadcasters to provide direct-to-home television services,&quot; Manley said in a press release.  </p>
<p>Manley's office said companies will have until February 28, 1997 to submit their proposals. However, it said that if a company already has a DBS satellite or sufficient DBS capacity &quot;to meet interim Canadian needs,&quot; it would be considered for &quot;fast track&quot; licensing.</p>
<p>Applications for the fast track process must be received by December 16, 1996, Industry Canada said.  </p>
<p>Manley's decision to invite Canadian-only bids for the use of the satellite slot came after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission denied a bid by Telquest Ventures and Tele-Communications Inc to beam TV programs across North America through two Canadian satellites which were to be owned and operated by Telesat Canada.</p>
<p>&quot;Both Canadian and American consumers would have benefitted from the deal, but it is clearly time to move forward and pursue other options,&quot; Manley said.</p>
<p>He said that in order to invite new bidders, he had withdrawn a February letter of support he wrote for Telesat's proposal to launch the two satellites.</p>
<p>Telesat is still considered a very strong candidate in the new bidding process. The company is owned by Alouette Telecommunications Ltd, which is 57 percent held by BCE Inc. The rest is owned by Canadian telephone companies and by Spar Aerospace Ltd.</p>
