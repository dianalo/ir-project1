<headline>Shanghai copper closes higher on LME gains.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1996-09-27</dateline>

<p>Shanghai copper futures ended higher in active trading on Friday thanks to overnight gains on the London Metal Exchange, traders said.</p>
<p>The most active January 1997 contract ended at an intra-day high of 20,160 yuan ($2,428) per tonne, rising 220 yuan. It opened at 20,050 and hit a low of 20,010.</p>
<p>October rose 50 to 20,350 yuan, November 60 to 20,190, December 130 to 20,150, February 220 to 20,140 and March 200 to 20,180. Combined volume rose to 49,240 tonnes from 32,780.</p>
<p>Copper opened higher and rose further before most contracts closed at their intra-day highs.  </p>
<p>Traders said LME gains triggered short-covering in Shanghai and long position holders also offset their positions with the approach of China's National Day holiday.</p>
<p>The holiday will last for five days from September 28 to October 2. Trading will resume on October 3.</p>
<p>&quot;Short-covering was the major factor and investors were not willing to hold positions during the holiday,&quot; one trader said. &quot;They did not want to face risk of sharp movements on the LME, which will trade normally during the holiday.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said Shanghai copper lost direction after copper did not breach the key $1,950/70 resistance level on the LME.  </p>
<p>&quot;Copper could rise further if it breaches that level,&quot; a second trader said. &quot;Otherwise it will consolidate at around 20,000 yuan.&quot;</p>
<p>Aluminium ended up, with October rising 20 to 13,920 yuan per tonne and November 80 to 13,950. Combined volume rose to 280 tonnes from 220.</p>
