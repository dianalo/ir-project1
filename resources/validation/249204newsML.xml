<title>BURMA: Burma says U.S. seeking excuse for sanctions.</title>
<headline>Burma says U.S. seeking excuse for sanctions.</headline>
<dateline>RANGOON 1996-12-11</dateline>

<p>Burma on Wednesday said the United States was trying to use the military government's current restrictions on opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's movements as an excuse to impose sanctions on Rangoon.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. embassy has tried to bring her outside, knowing that it will be refused. I can see the trend is definitely heading toward creating more pressure for sanctions (against Burma),&quot; a senior government official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The official, who declined to be named, repeated his earlier clarification that the government's request for Suu Kyi to temporarily confine herself to her house last week during student protests was made out of sincere concern for her safety.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the U.S. embassy) realise and appreciate the real situation outside,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton in early October slapped a visa ban on senior officials of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) after Rangoon arrested hundreds of pro-democracy activists in late September.</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate in July passed legislation allowing Clinton to impose economic sanctions if repression in Burma worsened or if Suu Kyi was rearrested.</p>
<p>The Nobel peace laureate last week was asked by the government not to leave her lakeside residence for two days after Rangoon last week saw its biggest student street protest since pro-democracy uprisings in 1988.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi's aides have said she had since largely remained in her compound partly to avoid being drawn into the unrest.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi's opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) and the protesting students have denied any links. But Suu Kyi has said she shares student opposition against alleged police brutality and injustice.</p>
<p>The students, whose campuses were closed since Monday, said they took to the streets because of unfair police treatment of their colleagues involved in a brawl with restaurant owners in October.</p>
<p>Over 860 students taking part in protests were briefly detained last week.</p>
<p>Small pockets of students have shouted anti-government slogans in public in the past two days. Government roadblocks near campuses have prevented large groups of students from rallying.</p>
<p>The government official early this week charged that some NLD members, exiled Burmese students and the outlawed Communist Party of Burma had tried to instigate student protests.</p>
