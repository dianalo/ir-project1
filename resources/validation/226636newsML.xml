<title>UK: Edward VIII was no Nazi, just fool - papers.</title>
<headline>Edward VIII was no Nazi, just fool - papers.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>A royal mystery will be solved this week when secret British documents will show King Edward VIII was no Nazi sympathiser but a &quot;damn fool&quot;, according to the Express on Sunday newspaper.</p>
<p>The paper said secret Foreign Office documents -- previously kept back by the royal family for fear of humiliating the former king -- would be released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They will apparently clear up long-running controversy over Edward's political sympathies, with many historians believing Edward actively helped Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p>Edward was king of Britain from January to December 1936, when he renounced the throne to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. After the abdication crisis, Edward moved to France and the paper said the documents show British concerns at the couple's lavish lifestyle and his ill-considered visits to pro-German Spain and Portugal in 1940.</p>
<p>The Express said Queen Elizabeth had given persmission for the papers to be made public and quoted one insider as saying: &quot;The papers confirm Edward was a damn fool, but not a traitor.&quot;</p>
