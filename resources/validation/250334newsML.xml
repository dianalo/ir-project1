<headline>F.O. LICHT - Daily sugar report.</headline>

<p>The following is a direct contribution from statistician F.O. Licht in Ratzeburg, Germany. Please address any queries to Helmut Ahlfeld on +00 49 4541 88920.</p>
<p>SUGAR - World market for December 10, 1996</p>
<p>White sugar futures in London closed slightly weaker in quiet trade. The spot March contract lost $0.80 to close at $297.25 per tonne, while May gave up $0.60 to close at $297.15 per tonne. The March white/raw premium narrowed slightly to around $69 per tonne and with the generally bearish sentiment in London, more selling is widely expected on the whites to drag it down further.</p>
<p>In New York raw sugar futures settled firmer in a consolidation to recent losses. Amid a continued dearth of physical offtake, ample supplies and a bearish technical outlook, March futures are seen continuing to descend toward 10 cents/lb.</p>
