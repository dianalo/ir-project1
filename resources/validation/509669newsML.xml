<title>VIETNAM: Four Laotians held in Vietnam on drugs charge.</title>

<p>Six members of a Golden Triangle drugs trafficking ring, including four Laotian nationals, were arrested in central Vietnam last week, police said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Two of the Laotians, arriving in Vietnam on a mountainous border road, were detained after 7.2 kg (15.8 pounds) of heroin was found under their car. Two others, who were waiting to take delivery in the city of Vinh, were arrested a few hours later.</p>
<p>Two Vietnamese people were also arrested in Vinh, where police seized another car, a gun and bullets.</p>
<p>One official said the drugs bust was the biggest yet in Ha Tinh province, which is on an increasingly active drugs trail from the Laotian border to Vinh, a major port town.</p>
<p>The government says it is concerned that Vietnam is being targeted by international drug syndicates as a conduit and market for illegal narcotics from the notorious Golden Triangle region which borders Vietnam, Laos and China.</p>
<p>Trafficking in as little as one kilogram of heroin is punishable by death in Vietnam. Courts in Vietnam recently passed death sentences against two Hong Kong citizens and a Vietnamese-Canadian for trafficking in heroin.</p>
<p>Attention is expected to focus next month on the trial of state police officials, border guards and about a dozen others for alleged involvement in an international trafficking ring.</p>
<p>The drugs scandal, Vietnam's biggest yet, broke last year when convicted Laotian trafficker Sieng Pheng earned a last-minute reprieve from execution in return for information.</p>
