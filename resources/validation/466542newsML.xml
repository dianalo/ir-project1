<headline>NYS legislature seen approving contingency budget.</headline>

<p>The New York State legislature looked set to approve by Wednesday Gov. George Pataki's contingency budget and close ahead of schedule for the Good Friday holiday, a legislative source said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The source, who declined to be named, explained that the legislature had planned to work on Thursday, but now hoped to send the $9.9 billion contingency budget to the governor by Wednesday, and begin heading home two days before the Good Friday holiday on March 28.</p>
<p>Pataki, whose Administration last year set a national record for late budgets by failing to get a pact until 104 days after it was due, has proposed a contingency budget to fund the government from April 1 through May 9. The state faces an April 1 deadline for its new, fiscal 1998 budget.</p>
<p>The Republican governor has blamed the need for a contingency budget squarely on the Assembly, which is led by Democrats, saying its wanted to increase spending by far too much.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have preferred to have a budget in place by April 1 but I will not sign a budget that recklessly spends $3 billion to $4 billion moe than I have proposed and returns us to the failed policies of the late 1980s and early 1990s,&quot; Pataki said, in a prepared statement released on Monday.</p>
