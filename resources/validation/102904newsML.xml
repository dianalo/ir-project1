<p>Russian security chief Alexander Lebed entered the nerve centre of NATO's military machine on Tuesday, disarming Moscow's Cold War foe with a message of peace and calls for closer cooperation.</p>
<p>Lebed, on the second day of his first trip to the West, toured NATO's sprawling military complex and declared Russia should forge closer military ties with the alliance and pledged Russian participation in any future Bosnia peace mission.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Russia will participate, we will play a serious part,&quot; he told reporters in Mons, southern Belgium in answer to questions over Moscow's continued participation in a possible follow-on force next year.</p>
<p>Russia has some 2,000 troops in the alliance-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia and a liaison officer at the military headquarters at Mons.</p>
<p>But Russia has made little effort to move ahead with other projects foreseen in the alliance's Partnership for Peace (PFP) programme which it agreed to join last year.</p>
<p>Lebed, building on the cooperative tone he has set throughout the visit, said it was time for that to change.</p>
<p>&quot;I concluded that the country I have the honour to represent has by no means exploited the full opportunities presented by PFP... I am sure that in the near future we will be able to organise close cooperation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Many NATO countries see cooperation within PFP as a forerunner to building a close post-Cold War relationship with Russia which will help quell its fears about alliance plans to expand eastwards.</p>
<p>Lebed, previously a harsh critic of enlargement, moderated his language during his visit to NATO's political and military headquarters, stressing time and again the need for the two former enemies to work together.</p>
<p>For 20 years a soldier pitted against the alliance, Lebed began his visit to Mons by scrawling a message of peace in the visitors' book.</p>
<p>&quot;The planet earth needs reason and intelligence and not wars. Let it be so,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>U.S. General George Joulwan, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe (SACEUR), added: &quot;Together, we can make it happen&quot;.</p>
<p>The exchange set the tone for the rest of the meeting.</p>
<p>At times, Lebed's first trip to the West has appeared more like that of a head of state, with both hosts and guests avoiding controversy and clearly trying to get to know each other better.</p>
<p>Lebed, President Boris Yeltsin's security adviser, is a strong candidate to succeed him if he has to bow out of office due to ill health.</p>
<p>Making his first ever visit to the West, Lebed has clearly enjoyed himself. On Monday, he met NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and addressed the alliance's 16 ambassadors on the future of Russia-NATO relations.</p>
<p>After being greeted by Joulwan at the entrance to the alliance's sprawling military complex of two-storey buildings, Lebed stood smartly to attention near a NATO banner and Russian flag as a military band played the Russian national anthem.</p>
<p>Lebed, dressed in civilian clothes but with his military bearing plain to see, walked slowly along an inspection line of soldiers from allied countries ranging from Turkey in the south to Norway in the north.</p>
<p>NATO defence ministers agreed last month to begin drawing up plans for a follow-on force in Bosnia when the current mandate to oversee the Dayton peace accords expires in December.</p>
<p>They have said Russian participation will help build closer ties, laying the groundwork for a new pact to assuage Moscow's concerns over alliance plans to grant membership to former allies, such as Hungary, Poland, and the Czech republic.</p>
