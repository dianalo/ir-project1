<p>Thirst for tea in Russia, home to the samovar and one of the world's top tea-consuming nations, could start to dry up because of a government decision to increase import duties.</p>
<p>Moscow, trying to protect its small tea packaging industry, doubled duties on Russia's packaged tea imports last month.</p>
<p>But the industry says the move will be tough to swallow and estimate Russia's demand for tea could slump by as much as 12 percent if retail prices rise the 20-50 percent officials expect.</p>
<p>For a cash-strapped population of 180 million, this could prove a cost too far -- even though Russians rank tea alongside bread and potatoes as a basic, essential product.</p>
<p>&quot;Ninety-seven percent of Russians drink tea,&quot; said Igor Lisinenko, head of the Russian Tea Association and chief executive officer of Russia's largest tea importer, the May Company. &quot;It is a product of mass demand.&quot;</p>
<p>A 20 percent duty is now payable on every packet of tea weighing less than three kg (eight lb) arriving in Russia -- double the previous rate. Including value added tax, nearly 40 percent of the price of imported packaged tea goes to duties and taxes.</p>
<p>A NATIONAL INSTITUTION</p>
<p>Tea, alongside vodka, is Russia's national drink.</p>
<p>&quot;Tea has always been our favourite hot drink,&quot; said Pyotr Kopylov, a driver in the Russian capital. &quot;We drink it in the morning, offer it to guests, and it rounds off any good party.&quot;</p>
<p>The figures speak for themselves. Association data pegged official imports at around 150,000 tonnes in 1996, second only to Britain, which brought in 180,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;However, analysts estimate that including tea smuggled into Russia, Russia just exceeds Britain,&quot; the association said.</p>
<p>India is by far the largest supplier, accounting for around 70,000 tonnes in 1996, followed by Sri Lanka, which delivered around 40,000 tonnes last year. Indonesia and China were well behind at 7,000 and 6,000 tonnes, respectively.</p>
<p>With annual world tea production around 2.5 million, Russia imports around seven percent of global output.</p>
<p>Russia does have its own tea growing region in Krasnodar on the Black Sea, but output there last year was a paltry 18,800 tonnes, down sharply from 28,200 tonnes in 1995.</p>
<p>DUTY HIKE STARTS TO HURT</p>
<p>The duty hike is already filtering through to some shops and wholesale markets, while others are holding retail prices at old rates, possibly taking a cut in profits in order to maintain sales volumes.</p>
<p>&quot;In many Russian shops -- in fact in the majority -- packaged tea prices have risen (as a result of the duty),&quot; said Vladimir Perekrest, a May Company spokesman.</p>
<p>He said prices at Moscow's giant Marinsky wholesale market had already risen by seven percent. In the Vladimir region to the east of Moscow, shop prices are up 10-12 percent.</p>
<p>But at others outlets prices remain unchanged so far.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment we have not noticed any increase in prices for tea packaged abroad,&quot; said Galina Pavlova, a saleswoman in a major Moscow retail tea store, Tea-Coffee.</p>
<p>The shop, with its decaying Chinese-style facade, is still bustling with customers of all generations carefully selecting teas and coffees in a quitessentially Russian ritual.</p>
<p>Russians have no doubt that any significant rise in prices will be enough to knock down demand for the national drink.</p>
<p>&quot;The duty increase is very important,&quot; Pavlova said. &quot;Basically, we have a lot of old and unemployed people in our shop, so of course it will affect demand if prices go up by as much as the trading companies are saying.&quot;</p>
<p>The Russian Tea Association estimates prices for cheaper brands could rise by 30 to 50 percent as a result of the duty increase, while more expensive brands could rise by a more modest but still significant 20 to 30 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I would definitely drink less tea if prices went up that amount,&quot; Kopylov said.</p>
<p>PROTECTING DOMESTIC INDUSTRY</p>
<p>One of the main aims of the import duty increase is to protect Russia's small and struggling tea packaging industry. Import tariffs on unpacked tea have not risen, giving bulk importers who then package tea within Russia the upper hand.</p>
<p>May's Lisinenko said the move was discriminatory and would lead to a fall in the quality of tea that trading companies like his have managed to provide since economic reforms began six years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1991 and 1992, there was practically no choice,&quot; he said. &quot;We have secured tea for Russians and have ensured competition in the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Russian tea packagers, like the Nikitin tea company, may stand to benefit from the tariff hike.</p>
<p>Nikitin's director of marketing, Anton Derlyatka, said such drastic measures were needed to shore up Russia's packers.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, our industry costs are 7.5 times higher than those of packaged-tea importers,&quot; he said. &quot;The main thing is to create fair competition between domestic packagers and importing companies.&quot;</p>
<p>TEA INDUSTRY WATCHING THREAT FROM COFFEE</p>
<p>Russia's tea industry is aware any rise in tea prices could be a boon for Russia's budding coffee industry.</p>
<p>Supermarkets in Moscow are full of a wide range of instant and fresh-ground coffees, and the number of Russian roasting companies is on the rise. The market is still small compared to tea, but the potential for growth is seen by some as strong.</p>
<p>But coffee prices also rose sharply on the international markets earlier this year, hitting bean and instant coffee prices around the world.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think people will drink more coffee if tea prices go up,&quot; May's Perekrest said. &quot;Instant coffee prices have gone up by 20-25 percent this year and tea is still cheaper.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tea is the cheapest of the two, and considering the income level of most of the population, there is not much room for consumption of coffee to rise until there is a substantial increase in individuals' incomes,&quot; said a Moscow-based tea industry source.</p>
