<title>USA: U.S. spot products mixed on volatile NYMEX trade.</title>
<headline>U.S. spot products mixed on volatile NYMEX trade.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-11-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. spot refinery products prices were mixed at the close of NYMEX trade Friday, as players backed away from cash market activity in the face of volatile futures movement.</p>
<p>NYMEX heating oil prices slid sharply in late trade pulling outright spot prices down, though little change in differentials was noted.</p>
<p>Market watchers attributed the selloff on the NYMEX to position-squaring ahead of the short U.S. Thanksgiving holiday week, and concerns that the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food plan may soon be implemented.</p>
<p>Prompt gasoline prices in New York Harbor (NYH) gained on the back of December NYMEX prices, with conventional M5 unleaded seen trading at 2.50 cents over the futures.</p>
<p>Early Friday prompt Harbor gasoline trade was busy, one trader said, &quot;but buyers were dragging their feet based on the cargoes that are coming into the NYH next week.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. Gulf Coast diffs for conventional M4 unleaded gasoline for the 34th cycle sat at 2.00 cents under the screen, unchanged from Thursday's level, though little activity was noted following Thursday's scheduling deadline for the 33rd cycle on the Colonial Pipeline.</p>
<p>However, upline prices for the conventional unleaded M4 on the 33rd cycle were talked at 3.00 cents under December NYMEX, with a small deal done at 2.60 cents under the screen.</p>
