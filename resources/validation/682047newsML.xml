<p>The acquisition of American Exploration Co by Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp in a $350 million stock and cash deal will create an oil and natural gas producer that ranks among the top 20 independents in terms of reserves.</p>
<p>The two companies also expect their share price improve as they will have a combined market capitalisation of more than $1.1 billion and will be better placed for further acquisitions, Mark Monroe, president of Dreyfus, and Mark Andrews, chief executive of American, said in an interview on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are going to be bigger and more powerful than either of our two companies would be on their own and better able to take advantage of any opportunities that arise,&quot; Monroe said.</p>
<p>The companies believe investors will also be forced to pay attention to a venture whose shares in issue will increase 150 percent to 18.5 million shares.</p>
<p>Louis Dreyfus, driven in the past by acquisitions, has spent $700 million recently in producing oil and gas properties.</p>
<p>&quot;This really jump-starts our exploration programme, until now we primarily bought and developed wells,&quot; Monroe said.  </p>
<p>Dreyfus will not have to borrow to finance the $45 million cash part of the acquisition, but has a $400 million credit facility of which $220-$230 million is currently in use.</p>
<p>The merged group will have a debt to equity ratio of 50 percent and debt of 2.3 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortortisation, said American's Andrews.</p>
<p>Monroe said that the premium Dreyfus was paying for American's shares was around 20 percent over the three month average price.  </p>
<p>Dreyfus, because of its concentration on buying in and developing reserves has a success rate of 95 percent in terms of gas wells developed to discovered.</p>
<p>&quot;We see that solid growth and development success as providing the cashflow for American's exploration programme,&quot; said Andrews.</p>
<p>The production cost for Louis Dreyfus is 48 cents per thousand cubic feet of natural gas and somewhat higher for American because of its exploration programme.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is not a cash transaction, we are not borrowing $350 million to finance this, so if prices do turn down, we will be better placed to withstand any pressure because we are larger,&quot; said Monroe.</p>
<p>American expects to benefit from Louis Dreyfus natural gas marketing presence.</p>
<p>&quot;If you can market your own gas, that really gives you an advantage,&quot; said Andrews. ((-- David Chance New York Newsroom 212 859 1902))</p>
