<p>More than a dozen research teams are seeking pieces of a meteorite to look for evidence that primitive, single-cell organisms existed billions of years ago on Mars, a NASA scientist said.</p>
<p>A space agency advisory panel will begin on Friday to consider about 15 requests for slices of the Martian meteorite as scientists around the world seek to shed more light on one of the great mysteries of our universe -- the possible existence of life on Mars.</p>
<p>&quot;We are getting requests to do a variety of studies that are aimed at confirming, or perhaps denying, the results that have already been published,&quot; Marilyn Lindstrom, a curator with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>A consortium of NASA and university scientists announced in August it had discovered microfossil remains in a meteorite known as ALH84001. Blasted away from the surface of Mars by the impact of an asteroid about 16 million years ago, the meteorite carried to Earth evidence of organic, carbon-based molecules -- the building blocks of life on Earth.</p>
<p>Researchers have proposed several strategies for testing the findings of the NASA consortium, including studies of the cell walls of microfossils found in the meteorite, of the age of carbonates in the rock and of different types of organic compounds like amino acids that would confirm the existence of life.</p>
<p>NASA and the National Science Foundation are considering jointly funding some of the research into the Martian meteorite, and Lindstrom said she expects she will eventually field about 50 requests for pieces of the rock. Details of the research proposals to be considered in the weekend meeting were not released.</p>
<p>Even before the NASA consortium published its theory in Science magazine, some 30 slices and 100 chips of the meteorite were in the hands of researchers. NASA has a dozen confirmed Martian meteorites in its collection, but the one found in the Allen Fields of Antarctica in 1984 was considered the best prospect for yielding clues to life on the Red Planet.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the one that's very old, the one with the best likelihood of life,&quot; said Lindstrom, curator of the space agency's Martian asteroid collection, housed at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston.</p>
<p>In the ALH84001 meteorite, which weighs about 4 pounds 3 ounces (1.9 kg), carbonates are present in less than 1 percent of the rock, and possible organic matter is found in less than 10 percent of the orange carbonate deposits, she said.</p>
<p>While researchers study slivers carved from the meteorite for evidence of life on Mars, a separate piece of the rock is being put to more Earthly uses. A large chunk was promised to the Smithsonian Institution for a public display, and is periodically brought to Capitol Hill for private exhibits in Congress, which sets NASA's research budget.</p>
