<p>Lan Chile plans to keep air cargo rates out of Europe to Latin America stable this autumn, said cargo manager Europe, Martin Rehs.</p>
<p>He told Reuters in an interview: &quot;We do not plan any rise. In the low season, we have been able to keep our rates fairly stable and at a relatively high level.&quot;</p>
<p>Rehs added he did not want to cash in after clients had paid relatively high rates during the low season.</p>
<p>The airline operates Boeing 767-300 passenger flights four times a week from Frankfurt via Madrid to Santiago and also operates ad-hoc freighters out of Europe, he said.</p>
<p>Rehs added: &quot;Lan Chile comes on to the market as a relatively high price carrier. We will wait and see, but the prime aim is not to raise rates but to increase tonnage.&quot;</p>
<p>Lufthansa Cargo AG, Air France, Martinair and Lan Chile all have relatively equal shares of the Europe to Chile market, he noted.</p>
<p>Competition is higher on ad-hoc business, particularly from U.S. carriers such as Polar Air Cargo, he noted.</p>
<p>Goods carried to Chile include pharmaceutical goods, fertilisers, car spare parts and general industrial goods, while top Chilean air cargo exports to Europe are fish and fruit, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very optimistic about Chile although as a small country it has a limited market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rehs described Argentina as the largest Latin America market but noted competition out of Europe is very strong with a rising numbers of freighter services.</p>
<p>The Spanish market to Peru is expanding thanks to investment by Spanish telecommunications company Telefonica in the country, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a large market out of Spain. There are several projects there and we have increased freighter flights from Chile to Lima,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lan Chile is also seeing ex-Europe to Mexico growth driven by production facilities of European car manufacturers Volkswagen and Renault, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mexico is a very large market which is characterised by several large clients such as Volkswagen which is carrying a vast amount of cargo from Seat in Spain to Mexico,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In France we see three daily, full freighters flying to Mexico and the cargo potential is there,&quot; he added.</p>
