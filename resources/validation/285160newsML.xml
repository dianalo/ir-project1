<title>KENYA: Strong inflows keep Kenya shilling buoyant.</title>
<headline>Strong inflows keep Kenya shilling buoyant.</headline>

<p>The Kenyan shilling was buoyant on strong dollar inflows Friday in quiet trading, commercial bank dealers said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Kenya posted mean shilling average of 54.88 against the dollar from 54.97 while on the pound, the shilling was posted at 92.96 from 94.03.</p>
<p>Dealers said the shilling was boosted by inflows streaming in from coffee and the tourism sector coupled by a lack of dollar-buying interest.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like the dollars from the coffee sector are still in the market,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;Demand has not yet come in.&quot;</p>
<p>Another dealer said the shilling's appreciation against other leading currencies was a reflection of the pound weakening against the greenback in the international market.</p>
<p>Some dealers said trading was quiet because most players were still closed for Christmas and New Year holidays.</p>
<p>They expected acitivity to pick next week when normal business resumes.</p>
<p>The money market was very liquid with most banks seeking to lend funds. Overnight rates were quoted as low as six percent.</p>
