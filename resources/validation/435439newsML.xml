<p>Bayern Munich chairman Franz Beckenbauer launched another strong attack on his team after a second defeat in four days handed the initiative to Borussia Dortmund in the German league title race on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bayern, who had lost just once in 20 matches all season before their calamitous 5-2 defeat at Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday, struggled to put their game together in a 2-0 defeat at Armenia Bielefeld.</p>
<p>Reigning champions and European Cup quarter-finalists Dortmund opened up a three-point lead over the Bavarians at the top after a 3-0 win over Hansa Rostock.</p>
<p>Former World Cup-winning captain and coach Beckenbauer was scathing about Bayern's thrashing at Leverkusen at the weekend and after watching German international striker Stefan Kuntz score twice in the first half to give Bielefeld a 2-0 victory, Beckenbauer's sharp tongue was soon wagging.</p>
<p>&quot;I expected them to bounce back but it didn't happen. Nobody is really attacking. That is our main problem at the moment,&quot; the 51-year-old former libero said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not aggressive enough. We're standing off our opponents. If I got that much space, I'd would still be able to play today.&quot;</p>
<p>Coach Giovanni Trapattoni added: &quot;We began very badly for the second time. There is no excuse for that. We are going to have to show character now.&quot;</p>
<p>Bayern have won the Bundesliga just twice in the 1990s and are desperate to lift a record 14th championship. But these two defeats have given 1995 and 1996 champions Dortmund a superb chance to complete a hat-trick of titles.</p>
<p>Dortmund seem to be hitting form at the right time. Two goals from former German international striker Karlheinz Riedle and a strike from his Swiss partner Stephane Chapuisat secured their home win over Rostock.</p>
<p>In the second surprise of the evening fourth-placed Leverkusen were unable to match their weekend form and lost 3-0 at 1860 Munich.</p>
<p>Leverkusen coach Christoph Daum was frustrated at seeing VfB Stuttgart jump over his team into third place after their 5-1 win at Cologne on Tuesday. Both teams are level on 41 points, five behind Dortmund.</p>
<p>&quot;Football has a lot to do with concentration and Munich took advantage of our weaknesses in that area,&quot; former VfB Stuttgart trainer Daum said.</p>
<p>&quot;We needed to show the same kind of form as against Bayern. I don't know why we weren't able to produce it.&quot;</p>
