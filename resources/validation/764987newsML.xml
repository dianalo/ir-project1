<p>Two Portuguese construction companies, Engil and Edifer, said on Wednesday they had agreed to join forces to form a new &quot;economic group,&quot; but analysts doubted it would lead to a full-blown merger.</p>
<p>&quot;Engil and Edifer signed a preliminary agreement today to negotiate ... the creation of a new economic group to integrate their activities...guaranteeing a common strategy,&quot; a statement from both companies said.</p>
<p>The statement stopped short of announcing an outright fusion of the two companies, which would create one of Portugal's biggest construction groups.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not believe in a fusion of the two companies or in the purchase of (Edifer) by the other,&quot; said one analyst who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Another analyst said: &quot;I think that the most probable scenario will be an exchange of shares and the development of some business together.&quot;</p>
<p>Joao Pereira of Espirito Santo Research said: &quot;This could be a type of joint venture to promote real estate projects.&quot;</p>
<p>He doubted that Engil and Edifer would ultimately merge as he said that the families that hold major stakes in both companies would be unwilling to lose control.</p>
<p>Profits of Portuguese construction firms are set to rise sharply this year due to strong order books and analysts said some groups could consider joining forces to beef up financial capacity to bid for large projects.</p>
<p>A source close to Edifer said in terms of activity inside Portugal, the company ranked fifth in turnover. Engil is fourth.</p>
<p>Edifer, which is owned by the Pires Coelho family, had turnover of 41 billion escudos in 1996. Engil had turnover of 62 billion escudos last year when it posted a profit of 1.5 billion escudos, up from 1.2 billion the previous year.</p>
<p>Engil shares closed sharply higher after news that it was starting talks on the integration of the two groups' business strategies. Engil closed at 2,220 escudos, up 45, in volume of 262,420 shares.</p>
<p>Edifer is not listed on the Lisbon bourse.</p>
