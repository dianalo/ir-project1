<p>Italian Open champion Mary Pierce continued her imperious form on Saturday by blasting her way in straight sets past Amanda Coetzer, conqueror of top seed Steffi Graf, to reach the final of the $926,000 German Open.</p>
<p>In the final the French woman will meet Mary Joe Fernandez, who played the more consistent clay-court tennis to overcome erratic Czech second seed Jana Novotna 6-3 6-1.</p>
<p>Pierce had to maintain full concentration to record a 6-4 6-4 win against the tenacious South African, who specialises in soaking up pressure and who allowed Graf only one game in their quarter-final.</p>
<p>But by the end of the match Pierce's pinpoint backhand and forehand drives were moving Coetzer all over the court, letting Pierce break service to love in the final game to clinch the tie and put her in sight of a second title in two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been a bit tired this week but if anything I'm playing even better,&quot; said Pierce, ranked only 11th in the world despite her win in Rome last week. &quot;It's just what I wanted before the French Open.&quot;</p>
<p>For Fernandez, ranked 14th in the world, Sunday's match will be a first final appearance in 11 months.</p>
<p>The American managed to make fast-court specialist Novotna look leaden-footed with her varied play, luring the world number four into a string of errors.</p>
<p>&quot;I tried to move Jana around the court and it worked very well,&quot; she said.</p>
