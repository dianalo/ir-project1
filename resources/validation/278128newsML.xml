<p>No sooner had energy-starved Bangladesh told prospectors that it might have huge oil and gas deposits than foreign energy firms were falling over themselves to try to exploit the potential.</p>
<p>Among them is Britain's Cairn Energy Plc which has already discovered a huge gas deposit in the Bay of Bengal and is set to explore further.</p>
<p>Other major companies expected to participate in a bidding round next month include British Gas Plc, U.S. companies Exxon Corp, Mobil Corp and Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc, Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Tullow Oil Plc of Ireland.</p>
<p>Despite this interest, some energy officials say the country still lacks proper policy guidelines.</p>
<p>PROSPECTING ON LAND AND AT SEA</p>
<p>Bangladesh has been divided into 23 blocks for oil and gas exploration under production sharing contracts (PSC), and the government will invite international bids for 15 blocks, including three offshore in the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<p>The bidding will be followed by &quot;promotional seminars&quot; in London and Houston in February, energy ministry officials said.</p>
<p>Energy experts believe there are potentially huge hydrocarbon deposits which a lack of technology and funds prevent Bangladesh from exploiting.</p>
<p>&quot;We are receiving a huge response from foreign oil companies following the success of Cairn in the offshore (Bay of Bengal),&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>Cairn, with Holland Sea Search Holding NV, conducted seismic surveys on a 1,000 square km (386 square mile) area in the Bay and drilled two wells in Sangu-1 block. A test run found a flow of 80 million cubic feet of gas a day.</p>
<p>The two companies signed a production sharing contract for two blocks in the Bay of Bengal and found the first offshore gas reserves in January. The companies spent $23 million.</p>
<p>They have offered 25 percent of their stake in Sangu to the U.S. firm Brown &amp; Root Energy Services, a subsidiary of Halliburton Co.</p>
<p>Officials said Cairn was planning to develop the field, construct a 40-km (25-mile) pipeline and drill three appraisal wells, maybe investing another $150 million.</p>
<p>OIL IN THE HILLS?</p>
<p>United Meridian Corp has been negotiating with the government to explore for oil in the southeastern Hill Tracts -- an area deserted by Shell in the 1980s after the firm failed to find any.</p>
<p>&quot;But (Meridian) is hopeful of striking oil in the area after analysing existing data,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>Rexwood-Okland International, a U.S. joint venture, is to sign a formal production sharing agreement for two offshore blocks, officials said.</p>
<p>They said Occidental Corp, which struck a deal in January this year, was expected to drill its first exploration well in the northeastern district of Sylhet, where Bangladesh's state-owned Petrobangla has found small reserves of oil.</p>
<p>The U.S. company is also trying to team up with Unocal Corp on a 50-50 basis.</p>
<p>The two companies are expected to spend about $350 million on gas exploration over two to three years.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT OFFERS INCENTIVES</p>
<p>Foreign oil companies have been offered a package of special incentives, energy ministry officials say.</p>
<p>Under Bangladesh's new energy policy oil companies are not required to pay royalty, signature bonus or corporate tax. There is no duty on importing machinery and investors are allowed full repatriation of profits.</p>
<p>While the new policy opens up the sector to private investment, experts say much has to be done before overseas funds can be expected to flood in.</p>
<p>They said while the policy offered a broader package of incentives, it lacked procedural guidelines such as whether the government would offer contracts on a first-come-first-served basis.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no clear guidelines in the policy. It only envisaged private sector participation in the petroleum sector,&quot; said a senior energy official.</p>
<p>&quot;Any interest by foreign investors may be frustrated by procedural delay in the absence of methodology of selection and award of particular ventures,&quot; added the official, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>INVESTMENT COULD SURGE</p>
<p>Some officials, however, see a bright future.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the overseas investment in oil and gas may be more than a billion dollars over the next couple of years,&quot; Towfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, executive chairman of the Board of Investment, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Gas reserves could prove much greater than current estimates of 10.2 trillion cubic feet, he said.</p>
<p>Ministry officials said Bangladesh had 17 onshore gas fields as well as the offshore one discovered by Cairn.</p>
<p>Chowdhury said U.S. investors showed &quot;tremendous&quot; interest in Bangladesh's energy sector during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to New York in October.</p>
<p>&quot;The key to reversing the poverty which afflicts many Bangladeshis, my government believes, is foreign investment,&quot; Hasina told more than 100 U.S. investors, mainly oil companies, in New York on October 25.</p>
