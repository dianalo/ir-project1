<p>The ruling Awami League on Monday accused the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of making outrageous and conspiratorial threats against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>
<p>&quot;The threats coming from the BNP leaders are outrageous...and conspiratorial,&quot; Awami League's assistant publicity secretary Abdul Mannan said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The BNP leaders threatening the prime minister are playing with fire. It will bring no good results,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mannan denounced what he called &quot;indecorous&quot; remarks made by BNP leaders at a reception at the Dhaka University on Saturday.</p>
<p>Newspapers quoted BNP leader and former telecommunication minister Tariqul Islam as saying: &quot;The fate of your father awaits you (Hasina).</p>
<p>&quot;Lakhinder (a legend of Hindu mythology) could not survive ...by sleeping in an iron chamber with not a single hole. Your father could not survive, nor shall you.&quot;</p>
<p>Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's independence leader and first president, was killed in a 1975 army coup along with most of his family.</p>
<p>His death, less than four years after he led Bangladesh to independence from Pakistan in December 1971, was followed by a long spell of rule by generals.</p>
<p>Other BNP officials, including the party's deputy leader in parliament, Badruddoza Chowdhury, also spoke harshly about Hasina and her three-and-a-half month old government. BNP leaders allege Hasina is running a &quot;partisan government&quot; while promising a neutral administration.</p>
<p>They have warned of dire consequences, which political analysts said could mean general strikes and transport shutdowns.</p>
<p>The latest threats against Hasina came as the prime minister sought to put Mujib's accused killers on trial.</p>
<p>A legal advisory committee has drafted a bill proposing repeal of a 1975 ordinance that gave Mujib's assassins indemnity.</p>
<p>Government officials said the draft was expected to be reviewed at a cabinet meeting on Monday before being placed in parliament next month.</p>
<p>Police have arrested three ex-army officers, former information minister Taheruddin Thakur and several others and charged them with Mujib's death.</p>
<p>The investigation started soon after Hasina took over as prime minister following a general election in June that returned her Awami League to power after 21 years.</p>
<p>Police tightenened Hasina's security on her birthday on September 30 after a newspaper reported a plot to kill her.</p>
<p>The daily Ajker Kajog said that &quot;intelligence agents have discovered and foiled a bid to kill Sheikh Hasina. The plot involved some leaders of a major political party who even hired suicide killers&quot;.</p>
