<headline>Financial planning soup -- finding financial advice.</headline>

<p>Finding competent and affordable financial advice untainted by commission-causing conflicts of interest has always been a challenge, but it may getting even more challenging.</p>
<p>As brokers, insurance agents, mutual fund salespeople, accountants, attorneys, tax preparers and more flock to fit under the &quot;financial planning&quot; umbrella, the industry is divided unto itself over what makes a legitimate financial planner, and how to identify them.</p>
<p>Now one organisation claims to have the answer. The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA), a trade group of planners that eschews commissions, has taken the highly unusual step of getting a trademark for the phrase, &quot;fee-only.&quot;</p>
<p>The trade group now claims legal authority over the phrase &quot;fee-only&quot; and intends to award it as a sort of &quot;seal of approval&quot; to financial advisors who refuse commissions, kickbacks and all other forms of indirect compensation and who pay a fee to get their backgrounds checked by NAPFA.</p>
<p>This isn't all bad. Robert Veres, a newsletter publisher who has long followed the financial planning business, suggests &quot;someone had to step in and define what is a fee-only advisor before every (commission) broker starts calling himself fee-only.&quot;</p>
<p>And, the organisation that authorised itself to step in, NAPFA, has a reputation for a highly trained and commission-free membership.</p>
<p>But it isn't all good either. The concept of one private trade group taking over a generic and already broadly-used designation like &quot;fee-only&quot; could itself be problematic.</p>
<p>Though the group intends to award the mark to advisors who are not members of their group, this puts other professionals, such as attorneys and accountants, in the position of having to pay a fee to NAPFA to earn the use of the phrase.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it may discourage or restrict consumer advocates and journalists, already in the habit of telling consumers to look for &quot;fee-only&quot; advice, from using that term lest they look like they are hawking a particular product.</p>
<p>Finally, just holding a trademark isn't much protection against others misusing it, concedes NAPFA Chairman Mark Spangler, who said &quot;You can't police everybody.</p>
<p>&quot;First you have to find them, let alone really restrict what they say.&quot;</p>
<p>In January, secret shoppers hired by NAPFA and the Consumer Federation of America found that three of every five planners using the words &quot;fee only&quot; were actually earning commissions or other third-party rewards.</p>
<p>So where does that leave consumers who want to find a good financial planner? Scratching their heads, as usual. If you are looking for a financial planner, don't just ask if they work on a fee-only basis, check out their background by asking for the ADV form they file with the SEC, and ask some more specific questions like these:</p>
<p>-- Do you ever earn commissions?</p>
<p>-- Are your investment trades carried out by a firm that you or your relatives own?</p>
<p>-- Do the companies that sell products you recommend provide you with gifts, trips, office support or other freebies?</p>
<p>Even if all three answers are &quot;no,&quot; there's still much you won't know about the advisor. You won't know if he or she is competent and provides complete financial planning. And you still won't know if the planner is overcharging you -- as the number of &quot;fee only&quot; planners grow, who's to say those fees are reasonable given the services they are providing?</p>
<p>To find the best planner for your situation, get personal recommendations, interview several planners and find one who has expertise with your specific financial questions.</p>
<p>If you have estate issues, find an attorney who knows all about those matters; for tax issues consult an attorney, CPA or enrolled agent. If you just want someone to pick mutual funds for you, watch your costs very carefully and see how far you can go just getting free advice from no-load mutual fund companies.</p>
<p>If you want soup-to-nuts financial planning advice, your best best is to go back to NAPFA. Not for their nouveau &quot;fee only&quot; designation, but for their traditional full-service planning membership.</p>
<p>To contact the NAPFA, call 1-888-333-6659.</p>
