<title>JAPAN: Toyota Motor leads profit stakes at halfway point.</title>

<text>
<p>Toyota Motor Corp. raced back to leading place among top earners listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in the first half of this business year, a corporate survey showed Monday.</p>
<p>Wako Research Institute of Economics said Toyota's parent current profit of 258.5 billion yen ($2.28 billion) in the six months to Sept. the first half of the 1996/97 business year, was the largest among 1,602 TSE-listed companies.</p>
<p>At the same stage last year Toyota trailed in fifth place with parent current profit of 68 billion yen ($601 million), lagging well behind front-runner Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. at 126.7 billion yen ($1.12 billion).</p>
<p>NTT took second place in the latest earnings season with a still-hefty 207.7 billion yen ($1.83 billion). Third-placed Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd made 89.1 billion yen ($788 million).</p>
<p>Toyota had ranked top at the same stage in 1994 but slipped last year because of slow exports and sluggish domestic sales. Its profits have been driven up this year by the weaker yen.</p>
<p>Current profit is pre-tax and includes gains and losses from securities investments and other non-operating activities.</p>
<p>By sales, trading houses monopolised the top ranks. Itochu Corp.'s 6.67 trillion yen ($59.0 billion) was largest, followed by Sumitomo Corp. and Mitsui &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The research arm of Wako Securities Co. said in a separate report that parent current profits of 766 major Japanese firms increased by an average of 11.88 percent in the half year.</p>
<p>All 766 companies tracked by the research unit are listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and have business years ending on March 31. They do not include banks, brokerages or insurance firms.</p>
<p>Wako also said 200 leading Japanese companies' projections of their business performances in the current business year were considerably less optimistic than actual results last year. The companies expect parent current profit to grow a scant 8.3 percent in the full year, against a 27 percent rise in their pre-tax profits last business year.</p>
