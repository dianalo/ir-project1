<p>The Sudanese air force bombed rebel-held parts of the northeast this month for the first time in about three weeks, a journalist who made a rare visit to the area said in a report published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Faisal Mohammed Saleh, a correspondent for the Cairo-based Sudanese newspaper al-Khartoum, said he was in the area at the time of the air raids on June 4 and 5. The planes, a MiG and an Antonov, dropped bombs but did no damage, he added.</p>
<p>The government in neighbouring Eritrea, which is friendly towards the rebels, has repeatedly denied foreign media organisations access to the area, which fell to the rebels in an offensive launched in January.</p>
<p>Saleh said he spent six days in the area with Brigadier Abdelaziz Khaled, a former Sudanese army officer who is now in command of rebel forces on the northeastern front.</p>
<p>He visited the towns and villages of Agitay, Adoubna, Atirba, Karora on the Eritrean border and Agig on the Red Sea coast about 50 km (30 miles) inside Sudanese territory.</p>
<p>The rebels are from the military wing of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a broad coalition of opposition groups trying to overthrow the Islamist government in Khartoum.</p>
<p>Saleh said between 150,000 to 200,000 people were living in the rebel-held area and appeared to be happy with the change, despite some food shortages and the loss of government salaries.</p>
<p>He quoted NDA fighters as saying that when they took the area they destroyed two exile training camps run by Eritrean Jihad, the Islamist opposition to the Eritrean government, one at Atirba and the other at Medafit.</p>
<p>Members of Jihad took part in the fighting alongside (Sudanese) government forces, they added.</p>
<p>The Sudanese government says Eritrean forces took part in the fighting on the rebel side but Eritrea has denied this. Saleh did not mention any Eritrean army presence.</p>
<p>The rebels have set up &quot;coordination offices&quot; in the area but few armed men are evident in inhabited areas because they are concentrated on the fronts, Saleh added.</p>
