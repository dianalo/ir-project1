<headline>NYMEX crude slips in anticipation of bearish APIs.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-15</dateline>

<p>NYMEX crude fell Tuesday afternoon reversing early session gains amid expectations that the American Petroleum Institute (API) will report bearish oil inventory data.</p>
<p>&quot;This is all pre-API action. That's why the oil complex is donw across the board,&quot; said an oil dealer in Atlanta.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not local players selling this thing either. It's traders calling into the floor to positions themselves ahead of the data,&quot; said the dealer.</p>
<p>At 1458 EDT, May crude was off 15 cents at $19.75 a barrel after rising to $20.09 early session.  </p>
<p>Traders expected crude stocks to rise by up to 3.5 million barrels in API's weekly report Tuesday evening due to a continued strong pace of imports. The data reflects the week ended April 11.</p>
<p>May gasoline was off 0.36 cent a gallon at 61.60 cents. Traders expected a tempered gasoline stock draw of about one million barrels as implied demand was seen easing somewhat from the 8.3 million barrel per day level in last week's data, which many thought was overstated.</p>
<p>May heating oil was up a mere 0.03 cent a gallon at 54.70 cents.</p>
<p>Indeed, heating oil stood to gain the most from the report since unseasonably cold weather in the U.S. Northeast was expected to have increased demand. Distillate stocks, which include heating oil and diesel, were expected by traders to fall up to 2.5 million barrels.</p>
