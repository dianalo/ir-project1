<p>Four northern California communities resembled ghost towns on Friday after a levee holding back a swollen river broke, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee.</p>
<p>Officials at Yosemite National Park in California said they would use military helicopters to evacuate about 900 tourists stranded by a flooded river at the scenic park in the Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>But clear skies over much of northern California and Nevada brought a respite from a week of storms that have caused floods, mudslides and power outages, killed at least 15 people and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage in five western states.</p>
<p>Authorities said 80,000 people had been evacuated from Yuba City, Marysville, Linda and Olivehurst along the rain-swollen Feather River, about 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Sacramento, California's state capital, leaving the towns deserted.</p>
<p>Many residents left voluntarily over the last few days but authorities ordered tens of thousands out on Thursday night as levees showed signs of weakening and one eventually gave way.</p>
<p>&quot;It's enormous. I've never experienced anything like it,&quot; Bill Harris, a spokesman for the Yuba County Office of Emergency Services, said of the huge evacuation. He said there were no reports of deaths or injuries.</p>
<p>Residents grabbed a few belongings and left the area, mostly in their own cars, on Thursday night. They spent the night at shelters or slept in their cars at gas stations.</p>
<p>About 10,000 people were being evacuated from the town of Linda on Friday, Harris said.</p>
<p>A 200-ft (60-metre) wide section of the levee gave way, spilling millions of gallons (litres) of water over an 11 square mile (28 sq km) area, officials said.</p>
<p>The flooded area is mostly agricultural, but a number of expensive homes and a golf course were inundated. So far none of the four towns has been flooded, but the water was moving towards Olivehurst, Harris said.</p>
<p>In a dramatic rescue, a Coast Guard helicopter plucked two people from the flood on Friday whose car had become stranded.</p>
<p>Trucks were used to dump boulders into the gap in the levee on Friday to try to slow down the escaping water while officials studied how to permanently repair the break.</p>
<p>On Thursday, California Gov. Pete Wilson declared a state of emergency in 25 northern California counties hit by the storms, making them eligible for state aid. Emergencies have also been declared in 24 counties in Washington state, six counties in Oregon and four in Nevada.</p>
<p>At Yosemite National Park, 150 miles (240 kms) southeast of San Francisco, park officials said they would use military helicopters to evacuate about 900 tourists stranded in the park since Wednesday evening because all roads out of the park valley are flooded. About 1,200 park employees who are also stranded will remain in the park for now.</p>
<p>Park officials said six military helicopters would be used to ferry the tourists to nearby Castle Air Force Base in an operation that could take a couple of days.</p>
<p>Park spokesman Chip Jenkins said the sewer system in Yosemite Valley, where the park's headquarters and lodging are located, had been shut down, the water supply was low and power had been off and on.</p>
<p>Reuters correspondent Alister Bull, vacationing at the park, said guests had been told to take one suitcase and be ready to leave.</p>
<p>Cleanup was under way in Reno, Nevada, hit by its worst flooding in 40 years on Thursday when the Truckee river overflowed, sweeping murky brown water through homes and businesses and forcing the closure of several casinos. Mud and debris littered the streets. Reno airport remained closed.</p>
<p>A heavy equipment operator was feared drowned on Thursday when a bank he was trying to shore up at a Nevada trailer park crumbled and he was swept away by floodwater.</p>
<p>Nevada Gov. Bob Miller said on Thursday that damage could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars and that he was seeking federal aid for flood victims.</p>
<p>A major bridge near downtown Seattle used by thousands of commuters daily was closed indefinitely after a mudslide destroyed some of its steel support columns. The slide, one of more than 100 reported within the city limits, also forced the evacuation of about a dozen homes perched on a bluff in the hard-hit Magnolia neighborhood.</p>
<p>Downtown Ashland in southern Oregon was flooded and some 21,000 people were warned not to use their tap water after a treatment plant was rendered useless.</p>
<p>In suburbs south of Portland homeowners who had just finished remodeling after last February's flooding found their homes inundated again, although most rivers had crested at levels several feet below their 1996 peaks.</p>
