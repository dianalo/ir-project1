<p>Plans to partially open up the European Union electricity markets do not go far enough but are a first step in the right direction, a British Conservative Euro-MP said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is too little, too slow, but it's the best we could have got at the moment,&quot; Giles Chichester told Reuters before the European Parliament's energy committee meeting to discuss the draft directive on electricity, COM(93)643.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a foot in the door,&quot; he continued, adding that consumer pressure would lead to more liberalisation before the directive came up for revision.</p>
<p>Chichester, the author of a report on the EU gas supply sector, said he hoped EU energy ministers would be able to approve a similar directive on gas liberalisation reasonably swiftly.</p>
<p>It took the Energy Council years to reach a compromise on electricity liberalisation.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope (the gas directive) will come through more quickly and that there will be greater possibilities for liberalisation,&quot; said Chichester, who describes himself as &quot;a red-blooded Conservative&quot;.</p>
<p>The MEP hopes on November 12 to win Parliament's support for his enthusiastically free-market report.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the UK (liberalisation) model or a variety of it could be applied in continental Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand the apprehension here about the advent of competition because it's change and there are genuine concerns that it might mean a loss of security of supply. (But) I think these are unfounded concerns,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>His reply to those who say that competition works only because Britain is a market with well-defined boundaries is that they ought to try it first and then see.</p>
<p>The report which Belgian Socialist Claud Desama is preparing on the electricity liberalisation directive, and which is due to be presented to Parliament in December, is likely to distinctly more lukewarm about the merits of liberalisation, a fact which Chichester agreed might make the Parliament look somewhat inconsistent.</p>
<p>He said the Christian Democrat group in the Parliament was unlikely to try and amend the Desama report to give it a more competition-friendly slant, namely by including references to the need to open up the electricity distribution sector to competition.</p>
<p>At this stage it was important not to do anything which might hold up parliamentary approval for the Council's common position on the directive, he said.</p>
