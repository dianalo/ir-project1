<p>Poland's finance minister said on Thursday he had suspended a scheme under which firms buy debts incurred by state hospitals for equipment and then sell them on for use in settling taxes -- a process known as &quot;debt farming&quot;.</p>
<p>The minister's action follow a probe by the government's watchdog, the Supreme Auditing Chamber (NIK), which sounded the alarm that the practice has cost the budget at least 100 million zlotys ($33 million).</p>
<p>&quot;In connection with this, the finance ministry has suspended the possibility of paying tax obligations with these debts,&quot; the minister, Marek Belka, told public radio.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a temporary solution. We first want to establish the scale of these activities and the mechanisms of possible breaches of law or abuses of this process, and then we will decide,&quot; Belka said in the broadcast interview.</p>
<p>At the weekend the main opposition party, the Union for Freedom (UW), said it would file a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in health minister Jacek Zochowski, who has been strongly defended by his fellow ex-communist, Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz.</p>
<p>Zochowski says he has acted to halt any abuses as soon as he became aware of them.</p>
<p>Government auditors say heads of hospitals have been buying equipment from domestic and foreign suppliers, knowing the state has not budgeted for such acquisitions, however necessary, and the hospital could not pay.</p>
<p>The supplier then sells the hospital's debt to other firms -- sometimes abroad -- who wait for punitive interest rates to build up, until finally someone buys and uses the now-inflated debt to settle tax bills under a government scheme designed to help debt-ridden public institutions.</p>
<p>It is this scheme the finance minister has suspended.</p>
<p>The final cost to the budget has worked out as much higher than such equipment purchases would have done if they had been officially included in the first place.</p>
<p>&quot;We know of 60 hospitals which made purchases worth about 100 million zlotys. How much the creditors will apply for is unknown,&quot; NIK deputy president Piotr Kownacki told Gazeta Wyborcza daily in an interview.</p>
<p>He said his department, which had been warning about the situation since 1995, was now inspecting tax offices to see how much they were paying out.</p>
