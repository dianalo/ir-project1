<p>The Mexican Bishops Conference said on Tuesday it would step up efforts to try and bring peace to Mexico's troubled southeastern Chiapas state.</p>
<p>Violence erupted in Chiapas on Jan. 1, 1994, when predominantly Maya Indian rebels of the Zapatista National Liberation Army launched an uprising throughout the state.</p>
<p>A peace process that began some months later has broken down, with the Zapatistas and the government blaming each other for holding untenable positions regarding an accord on Indian rights.</p>
<p>&quot;The conclusion at which we have arrived is that we, too, are going to enter the process to accompany them,&quot; Monsignor Sergio Obeso Rivera, president of the Mexican Bishops Conference (CEM), told a news conference.</p>
<p>Should the bishops enter the peace process they would join a group of legislators negotiating with the Zapatistas on behalf of the government as well as an independent mediating commission headed by one of their own, Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas.</p>
<p>Obeso said the bishops hope their role could include a &quot;physical presence&quot; in the affected communities of Chiapas but that so far they were only &quot;taking the first steps&quot; of analysing their potential function.</p>
<p>&quot;We visualize doing this to the extent that we are accepted as mediators,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Zapatistas are holed up in the Chiapas jungle, surrounded by the Mexican army while a ceasefire holds.</p>
<p>Rebel leader Subcommander Marcos recently claimed the conflict could revert to violence because of a threatening posture by the Army. He repeated his charge that the government was racist in reneging on pledges of granting special Indian rights.</p>
