<p>Only Iran can bring peace to northern Iraq where a U.S.-brokered ceasefire has halted inter-Kurdish fighting, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akhbar Velayati said in remarks published on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Iran is the only country which can bring peace to the region,&quot; he told reporters at Tehran's Mehrabad airport on Sunday where he had gone to see off his visiting Bangladesh counterpart Abdos Samad Azad.</p>
<p>Guerrillas of Kurdish warlord Jalal Talabani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) have been fighting in northern Iraq against rebels of Massoud Barzani, head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).</p>
<p>Washington brokered a ceasefire on Friday and persuaded them to attend peace talks next month. Britain offered to host the talks.</p>
<p>A similar ceasefire agreed under Washington's auspices last year failed to resolve differences between Talabani and Barzani on how to run their breakaway enclave which they have divided into two separate spheres of influence.</p>
<p>Iranian newspapers, reporting Velayati's remarks, quoted him as saying Iran &quot;has tried and is trying to minimise the tension in northern Iraq in the best possible way&quot;.</p>
<p>Iran was in the best position to bring the warring parties to the negotiating table for peace, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past we have played such a role with success. I don't think that the United States and Britain would be able to bring peace in north Iraq,&quot; Velayati said.</p>
<p>Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz on Sunday accused Iran of taking sides in the latest flare-up and described Tehran's action as &quot;hostile, flagrant...and harbouring serious expansionist tendencies&quot;.</p>
<p>The ruling Baath party newspaper al-Thawra in Baghdad said U.S. policy towards Iraq encouraged &quot;Iranian rats to leave their holes&quot;. It warned Iran not to take the current situation in the area as a pretext to meddle in Iraq's affairs.</p>
<p>Iran sent a small force into northern Iraq last month in pursuit of Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI) rebels.</p>
<p>Both Barzani and Iraq accuse Talabani of liaising with Tehran in the latest fighting. Iraq's official press has been critical of Talabani and last week published overtures to lure Barzani to Baghdad's camp.</p>
