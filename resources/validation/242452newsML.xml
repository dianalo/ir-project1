<text>
<p>Pope John Paul on Sunday called on warring sides in eastern Zaire to lay down their arms and seek a peaceful solution to their conflict.</p>
<p>&quot;I ask you again not to forget the ordeal that is raging in Africa, in the Great Lakes region,&quot; the Pope told pilgrims in St Peter's Square in his weekly Angelus message.</p>
<p>He said refugees from Rwanda and Burundi and the people of eastern Zaire were victims of &quot;fratricidal fighting...hunger, insecurity...mass exoduses from cities and villages, atrocities and horrors&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I renew my invitation to those who are involved in this conflict to cease their violence immediately and seek a peaceful solution through dialogue and negotiations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It was not the first time the Pope had spoken out on the situation in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>Last month, he said a multinational force for eastern Zaire should be deployed to find and help the refugees, estimated at up to 500,000.</p>
<p>Zairean rebel forces in the area oppose the deployment of a multinational force, apparently for fear that the force might try to restore the authority of the Kinshasa government.</p>
<p>A small Canadian-led force has already set up headquarters at Kampala in neighbouring Uganda but political problems have prevented it starting its mission.</p>
