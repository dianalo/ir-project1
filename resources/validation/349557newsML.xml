<p>New Zealand's Claudia Riegler claimed her third World Cup slalom win of the season on Sunday to keep Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg from clinching the slalom title.</p>
<p>Riegler, winner of the first two slaloms of the season, returned to the top of the podium after twisting her way down the sun-bathed Barguns course in a two-run combined time of one minute 20.75 seconds.</p>
<p>The victory marked an abrupt turnaround in form for the Austrian-born Riegler, who had failed to post a result in her last two races in Maribor and Zwiesel.</p>
<p>&quot;Today is the first time since the start of the season that, before the start of the race, I imagined I could win,&quot; said Riegler, after collecting her fourth career victory. &quot;The last two races, even during inspection, I didn't have good feelings.</p>
<p>&quot;I've worked hard the last two weeks to correct some technical problems.</p>
<p>&quot;Today is a confidence boost. I see now that I can be the best again and that's a better way to start the world championships than wondering if you can win.&quot;</p>
<p>No New Zealander has ever won a medal at the Alpine world championships, although Annelise Coberger did win the slalom silver at the 1992 Olympics in Albertville.</p>
<p>Lara Magoni gave Italian ski fans another reason to flock to the world championships, which start on Monday in Sestriere, after she posted the day's fastest second run to claim second place in 1:20.82.</p>
<p>&quot;I now believe it is possible to get on the podium in Sestriere,&quot; said Magoni, after registering the best result of her career.</p>
<p>Wiberg, the winner of three slaloms this year, missed clinching the slalom title when she finished just 0.01 seconds behind Magoni in a tie for third with Switzerland's Martina Accola.</p>
<p>With two races remaining, Wiberg tops the standings with 570 points, 181 ahead of Riegler. A win carries 100 points.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been happy to clinch the title today but it didn't happen,&quot; admitted Wiberg. &quot;Now it is finally time to concentrate on the world championships. I'll think only of that now.&quot;</p>
<p>Wiberg continued to extend her lead in the overall standings, adding a victory in the combined to go with her third place in the slalom.</p>
<p>She now has 1,425 points and a commanding 480-point lead over her nearest rival, reigning champion Katja Seizinger of Germany.</p>
<p>Seizinger was told by German team doctors not to race in the slalom after suffering mild concussion in a fall in Saturday's downhill. Doctors have ordered her to take three days' rest but said her participation in the world championships was not under threat.</p>
