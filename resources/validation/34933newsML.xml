<title>IRAQ: Kurd leader may turn to Iran against Saddam.</title>
<headline>Kurd leader may turn to Iran against Saddam.</headline>
<dateline>SULAIMANIYA, Iraq 1996-09-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Kurdish militia leader Jalal Talabani, charging that he faced renewed attack by Iraq and a rival Kurd faction, said on Thursday he was ready to seek Iranian help.</p>
<p>&quot;We will call support from any country which is ready to help us -- from Iran, Syria or Turkey. Whichever of them will help us we welcome,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview in his stronghold in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>Iraq and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) have accused Iran of sending troops into northern Iraq to help Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). Talabani said he had &quot;unfortunately not&quot; received arms and support from Iran.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no possibility for peace now in this area (around Sulaimaniyah)&quot;, Talabani said in his Sulaimaniya residence, 100 km (70 miles) from the Iranian border.</p>
<p>&quot;Today they started a new assault from the south -- 30 Iraqi armoured cars and 30 Iraqi tanks, with Iraqi soldiers and (Massoud) Barzani forces,&quot; he said in a reference to the leader of the rival KDP.</p>
<p>&quot;They are cooperating and planning to reach Chamchamal and towards Sulaimaniya,&quot; said the veteran head of the PUK. &quot;They hit Chamchamal today and yesterday with tanks and cannon.&quot;</p>
<p>In Washington, U.S. officials said they saw no evidence of any Iraqi fighting or troop buildup that would threaten Sulaimaniya.</p>
<p>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's troops, backing the KDP, on Saturday chased Talabani's guerrillas from the northern Iraqi regional capital of Arbil. Washington retaliated with cruise missile attacks on targets south of Baghdad on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>Talabani said Iraq will continue attacking their positions and the United States, which had said Iraqis were withdrawing, will not help the PUK.</p>
<p>&quot;Only four American fighter planes would be enough to stop the Iraqi forces,&quot; he said. He said the PUK had informed the United States of Iraq's plans, and accused Washington of being too slow off the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;They were afraid of the Republican Guards,&quot; Talabani. &quot;The Republican Guards would make a bigger attack and too much blood will fall. They do not want to see too much blood.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Washington, while disliking Saddam, was afraid of an uprising in Iraq, prefering to wait for a &quot;slow and calm&quot; change of administration.</p>
<p>Talabani said his forces were better prepared in Sulaimaniya and in a stronger position because the town was protected by mountains. Arbil lies on flat, bare land.</p>
<p>&quot;But without the help of the U.S. and (allied) forces, it is not easy to stop them,&quot; Talabani said.</p>
<p>The United States has proposed the KDP and the PUK resume aborted peace talks, which were taking place in London when Baghdad and the KDP attacked Arbil.</p>
<p>KDP leader Barzani has sent U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher a letter, welcoming the talks, but Talabani ruled out a resumption.</p>
<p>&quot;Barzani is an agent of Saddam Hussein,&quot; Talabani said. &quot;So why should we talk to him? We will talk to his master if anything...And we are not ready to talk to Saddam Hussein, he is a butcher dictator.&quot;</p>
