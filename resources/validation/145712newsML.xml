<p>U.S. Vice-President Al Gore could visit China in early 1997 if he was re-elected next month, a senior U.S. official said in Beijing on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have sent a proposal here and it's been reviewed and I don't think there's any real disagreement,&quot; U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs Eileen Claussen said when asked if Gore had any plans to visit China.</p>
<p>&quot;The vice-president is very interested in trying to establish...a sustainable development forum here between (Chinese Premier) Li Peng and the vice-president,&quot; she told a news conference.</p>
<p>No specific date has been set for Gore's visit.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now discussing terms of reference for that and there's every expectation that if those terms of reference are worked out, the vice-president will make a visit in the spring,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Asked to elaborate on the terms of reference, Claussen said: &quot;We just have to have sort of a set of operating rules and subjects we're going to talk about.&quot;</p>
<p>A visit by Gore could improve often stormy Sino-U.S. ties, which plunged to their lowest ebb in more than two decades after Washington enraged Beijing by allowing Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui to make a landmark, private visit in June 1995.</p>
<p>Beijing and Taipei have been diplomatic rivals since Mao Zedong's Red Army defeated and drove Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops into exile in Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.</p>
<p>China regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is due to visit Beijing in November and Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian plans to make a long-delayed trip to Washington before the end of the year.</p>
<p>China postponed Chi's visit to Washington in March, infuriated by a U.S. decision to order two aircraft carriers into seas near Taiwan as the island inched towards democracy -- holding its first direct presidential elections -- in the face of missile tests and live-fire war games.</p>
<p>Beijing and Washington have also wrangled over alleged sales of nuclear technology by China, human rights abuses in China and trade issues.</p>
<p>China has bitterly accused the United States of blocking its bid to gain admission to the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>Beijing and Washington narrowly avoided a trade war in June and February 1995 over widespread copyright piracy.</p>
