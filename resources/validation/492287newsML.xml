<headline>OPEC lifts March output to 26.9 mbpd - Reuter survey.</headline>

<p>OPEC blithely lifted oil output again in March and showed no sign of stemming the rising tide of production which has contributed to a 30 percent oil price slump in the space of three months.</p>
<p>Wellhead crude production from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries rose 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 26.90 million bpd in March from 26.77 million in February, a survey by Reuters of OPEC officials, oil companies and analysts found.</p>
<p>OPEC's drip-feed of extra supply, in tandem with rising volumes from non-OPEC producers, forced oil prices down to nine-month lows last week and left OPEC members facing the renewed possibility of budget squeezes.</p>
<p>Biggest OPEC producer Saudi Arabia, having enjoyed a $12 billion windfall last year, raised its 1997 budget projection for a barrel of Saudi crude by $2 to $16-$16.50.</p>
<p>Main Saudi export stream Arab Light on Monday was valued at about $15.50 for European buyers, down from $23 in January.</p>
<p>OPEC watchers say the chance of the 11-member cartel reining in supply to anywhere near its official 25.03 million bpd ceiling in response to lower oil prices remains slim at best.</p>
<p>OPEC's Gulf trio of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE still have capacity in hand but supply restraint seems a thing of the past for the remainder of the group.</p>
<p>&quot;Commercial considerations are now ingrained for most OPEC members,&quot; said one member country official. &quot;There's simply no going back to the days when OPEC tried to support prices and left non-OPEC to walk away with increased market share.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No one is planning anything at OPEC, that's for sure,&quot; said a senior OPEC official.</p>
<p>Rising Nigerian supplies were stunted in March by political protests which saw Shell facilities lose as much as 210,000 bpd over a 10-day period.</p>
<p>But the loss for the month cost Nigeria only 55,000 bpd, some of which was made by increases by other joint venture operators for an average 2.12 million bpd.</p>
<p>Iraq upped output in March under the United Nations oil sale but not by as much as some had anticipated.</p>
<p>After hiking supplies in early March to meet the deadline for the first 90 days of the U.N. deal, monitors said supplies fell back in mid-to-late March as buyers postponed liftings where possible to take advantage of more favourable April price formulas.</p>
<p>Exports in March averaged 600,000 bpd, up just 30,000 bpd on the month for overall Iraqi output of 1.18 million bpd.</p>
<p>Even OPEC's core Gulf trio now appears to be running consistently ahead of official quotas, though the transgressions remain relatively small compared.</p>
<p>Monitors put the UAE down slightly in March at 2.26 million bpd, 100,000 bpd over quota, as a result of minor maintenance on the Upper Zakum field.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia and Kuwait also were running some 100,000 bpd in excess of official allocations at 8.13 million and 2.10 million bpd, respectively.</p>
<p>Venezuela, which abandoned quota compliance long ago, kept production steady in March at 3.18 million bpd, despite some weather-related export disruptions.</p>
<p>The Reuter survey seeks a best estimate of wellhead flows in OPEC countries based on the views of officials, industry monitors and analysts inside and outside member countries.</p>
<p>OPEC quotas are based on supply to market, defined to exclude movements to, but not sales from storage.  </p>
<p>Table of average of findings from the Reuter survey are as follows:</p>
<p>		  MAR	FEB	JAN     3 MTH AV   QUOTA</p>
