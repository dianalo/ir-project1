<p>New orders received by U.S. factories dropped at the sharpest rate in 3-1/2 years during August, the Commerce Department said Thursday, adding to signs of a broad-based slowing in industrial activity.</p>
<p>Orders fell 1.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted $311.1 billion -- the largest monthly decline since a 2.2 percent decrease in January 1993. Nearly every major category of product shared in the falloff, which was sharper than the 1.2 percent decline forecast by Wall Street economists.  </p>
<p>The August orders drop followed a revised 1.7 percent July increase that was previously reported as a stronger 1.8 percent gain. Orders have fallen in two of the past three months including a 0.7 percent June decrease.</p>
<p>Orders weakened for both costly durable goods like cars and airplanes and for more quickly used non-durables like food and paper products.</p>
<p>Durables orders dropped a revised 3.2 percent to $166.8 billion in August after a 1.4 percent July rise, while non-durables orders were down 0.4 percent following a 1.9 percent jump in July.</p>
<p>Previously, the department said durables orders had fallen 3.1 percent in August, but it revised that fractionally.</p>
<p>The biggest factor in the durables orders decline was transportation equipment, as orders plunged 7.9 percent to $37.9 billion after declines of 1.5 percent in July and 1.3 percent in June.</p>
<p>The department said aircraft and parts were the major cause for the transportation orders slump in August, although new-car orders also were down from July.</p>
<p>Excluding transportation, August factory orders still were down 1.1 percent, the largest decline since a 1.5 percent drop in May 1993, after a 2.1 percent rise in July.</p>
<p>Shipments of motor vehicles and parts declined 2 percent in August to $28 billion after a 4.6 percent July rise. In the automobile industry, shipments correspond to orders.</p>
<p>Weaker factory orders were anticipated in view of other recent signs of cooling in manufacturing activity.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the National Association of Manufacturers said its September index of activity dipped to 51.7 from 52.6 in August as production, employment and export orders each grew A weaker industrial sector would contribute to an expected slowdown in overall economic activity from the second quarter's strong 4.7 percent annual rate of expansion. Many analysts foresee growth in the second half easing to around 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>Shipments of manufactured goods, which reflect more immediate demand than orders, increased in August by a slight 0.1 percent to $312.6 billion after a strong 1.1 percent July rise.</p>
<p>Order backlogs were down 0.3 percent to $502.6 billion, the first decline since April after a 1 percent July increase.</p>
<p>The only category that posted an August orders increase was defence items, up 10 percent to $5.3 billion after a 40.7 percent drop in July.</p>
<p>Orders for non-defence capital goods, a measure of business' expansion plans, dropped 10.2 percent to $41.3 billion after a 7 percent rise in July.</p>
<p>Primary metals orders fell 2.6 percent in August to $15.4 billion after a 1.6 percent July increase and industrial machinery orders declined 0.7 percent after a 2.8 percent July rise.</p>
