<title>AUSTRALIA: TNT chairman can't see higher bid.</title>
<headline>TNT chairman can't see higher bid.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-10-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The chairman of TNT Ltd, Fred Millar, said he did not expect the A$2.0 billion takeover bid by telecoms and postal firm Koninklijke PTT to be matched.</p>
<p>&quot;Until I read the press this morning it (the chance of a rival bid for TNT) hadn't even entered my mind,&quot; Millar told Reuters. &quot;I wouldn't think so, but I don't know,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Some market analysts have speculated that Federal Express Corp or another express freight group could bid for TNT. This speculation followed the statement by Bankers Trust that it had 19.99 percent of TNT and thought the KPN cash offer price of A$2.45 was at the low end of its range of valuations.  </p>
<p>Asked if there were other companies interested in TNT at about this price, Millar said: &quot;Well no one has come forward.&quot;</p>
<p>He said TNT had held talks with Federal Express, but not in the last year. &quot;We have spoken with them about various matters in relation to our European operations.&quot;</p>
<p>One analyst said on Wednesday that FedEx had been singled out because it did not have a strong European operation.</p>
<p>Millar said he could not say the KPN deal was set in stone.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't express any view on that. I don't know. We (the TNT board) have recommended it subject to a superior offer coming forward.&quot; -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800</p>
