<p>Citing security threats, former Indian prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao asked a judge on Thursday to exempt him from appearing in court next week after he was briefly arrested, then freed on criminal charges.</p>
<p>Rao asked Delhi chief metropolitan magistrate Prem Kumar to relieve him from having to appear on Monday to face three counts, including criminal forgery which carries a maximum jail term of seven years.</p>
<p>Rao, who quit in disgrace as Congress party leader last month, would become the first former prime minister to appear in court on criminal charges.</p>
<p>The former prime minister also asked Kumar to extend the temporary bail which another judge granted him on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rao's moves came after he was arrested at home on Wednesday evening, then quickly released on bail.</p>
<p>His arrest and release marked the latest chapter in a tangled legal saga which has forced him to step down as Congress leader and shaken the balance of power between his party and the government.</p>
<p>An official with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said two federal police officers served an arrest warrant on Rao at his heavily guarded New Delhi residence on Wednesday at around 8.45 p.m. (1515 GMT).</p>
<p>Rao immediately provided 50,000 rupees ($1,400) in bail and was released. The CBI officers left 30 minutes after arriving.</p>
<p>The arrest warrant was issued last week by a New Delhi judge but had been temporarily suspended pending a ruling by the Delhi High Court on a plea by Rao for legal protection against arrest.</p>
<p>Rao's forgery case dates from 1989. Last month, federal police charged the former prime minister and five others with using false documents to defame a rival politician. Rao has not commented publicly on the charges.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the High Court granted Rao the right to pay pre-emptive, or anticipatory, bail which would last until next Monday's hearing into the forgery case.</p>
<p>Rao's lawyers told Judge Kumar on Thursday that their client should be granted bail beyond next Monday because of his need for special medical attention for ailments including diabetes and heart problems.</p>
<p>They argued that Rao, who rarely appears in public and is constantly guarded by commandos carrying machine guns, should not be required to come to court on Monday because of security threats.</p>
<p>Delhi authorities maintain that once Rao enters a local courtroom, his special security entourage must be replaced by local police. But Rao claims authorities cannot guarantee his safety in the crowded local courts.</p>
<p>Kumar was scheduled to take up Rao's requests on Friday.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, the Supreme Court was expected to rule on Rao's request that a hearing in a separate case of criminal cheating be shifted from Delhi's teeming Tis Hazari court complex to a spacious, marble-walled convention centre.</p>
<p>That hearing was rescheduled for next Wednesday, but its venue will depend on the Supreme Court ruling. Rao has denied allegations he helped cheat a businessman of $100,000 in 1983.</p>
<p>Fallout from Rao's legal cases extends well beyond the party as Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's minority coalition depends on Congress to survive a parliamentary challenge by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
