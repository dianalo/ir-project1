<p>Shares in Britain's most profitable bank  Lloyds TSB Group Plc rose sharply on Friday as it reported a massively  improved return based on lower costs and higher incomeand some analysts  predicted an upgrading of full-year forecasts.</p>
<p>Lloyds TSB's pre-tax profit figure was within expectations at just  over 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in the first half of the year,  but its dividend was higher than most in the market had expected 5.3  pence per share against 4.2p a year ago.</p>
<p>The bank's shares performed strongly on the back of the data rising  to a high of 707p before settling 28p higher at 703.5p by midmorning.</p>
<p>Lloyds shares had already improved by well over 100 percent from their  low point in the last year.</p>
<p>&quot;They are a very strong set of figures,&quot; said BZW banking analyst  Tim Sykes. &quot;There was a fantastic performance on mortgages, interest  margin and a wonderful return on equity.&quot;</p>
<p>Lloyds TSB's return on equity figure, already very high at 34.8 percent  at the end of last year, jumped again to 40.4 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Underneath all the adjustments, the results are very solid,&quot; said  John Leonard, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. &quot;I expected a good  performance on costs but not quite this good.&quot;</p>
<p>Lloyds saw its cost to income ratio drop significantly to 51.7 percent  from 57.7 percent as internal cost controls and the benefits of its  merger with TSB began to come through. It said it still expects the  latter to be at least 400 million pounds a year by 1999.</p>
<p>A rise in total income to 3.59 billion pounds, or seven percent, came  despite a further 50 million pounds provision against payments the  bank may have to make to customers who were mis-sold pensions. Its  total provision for this now stands at 250 million pounds.</p>
<p>On an economic profit basis -- the difference between the earnings  on the equity of a business and its cost -- the results were even  more positive, rising 75 percent to 816 million pounds.</p>
<p>Lloyds saw good growth in its core retail banking operation, with  personal loans and credit card lending growing by 13 percent and profit  from mortgages up by 18 percent.</p>
<p>Lloyds said it will begin to sell its C&amp;G mortgage brand through TSB  branches as well as through branches of Lloyds in the second half  of 1997.</p>
<p>Analysts say that Lloyds shares are expensive by almost all conventional  measures, but the bank's sustainable and high quality income stream  means most are still buyers of the stock.</p>
<p>Nick Collier, banking analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter forecast  an upgrading of full-year forecasts on the back of Friday's numbers.</p>
<p>Lloyds TSB is currently forecast to make a pre-tax profit of over  3.1 billion pounds for thew full year.</p>
