<p>A tropical depression overhanging the Mexican peso over the past two weeks may be lifting, though U.S. analysts are not giving any all-clear signals until after the U.S. elections next week.</p>
<p>After dipping below the psychological threshold of eight to the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, the peso wobbled in thin trading. At 1400 EST/1900 GMT, the peso was quoted at 7.970/990.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are not seeing the same kind of selling as two weeks ago,&quot; said Jose Barrionuevo, senior economist at Chase Securities Inc.  &quot;The pressure should start waning tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>The peso's weakness this week owed more to tight liquidity than to speculation, as Mexican banks had to square their positions in dollars before the end of the month, he said.</p>
<p>Corporations, which have increased their reliance on dollar-denominated loans, also have to meet their short-term dollar obligations, Barrionuevo added.</p>
<p>As the new month dawns, a less pressing demand for dollars could make the neurotic market breathe easier, he said.  </p>
<p>David Malpass, international economist at Bear Stearns and Co Inc, made a similar observation that the peso's slide was exaggerated in an illiquid market.</p>
<p>U.S. mutual funds, for example, essentially refrained from stepping into the market as they closed their books, he said.</p>
<p>Analysts generally agreed that the Mexican economy is doing better now than when the peso was trading at 7.50 per U.S. dollar earlier this year and the peso's swift fall was an overshoot.  </p>
<p>The speculative attack, set off two weeks ago by the Mexican government's revision of plans to privatize the petrochemical industry, had little to do with economic fundamentals, said Larry Krohn, chief Latin America economist at UBS Securities.</p>
<p>Just as the jittery market was looking for more excuses to push down the peso, a delay in implementing pension reform and restive rebels in the southern state of Guerrerro poured added fuel on the fire.  And the peso's volatility, if persisting, could lead to more self-fueling attacks, Krohn said.  &quot;The situation remains vulnerable.&quot;  </p>
<p>Barrionuevo of Chase does not expect calm to return until the direction of the U.S. long bond becomes clear after next week's presidential election.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Democrats gain control of the Congress, perceived changes in the (U.S.) fiscal outlook could weaken the long bond and add pressure to the peso,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons for the peso's weakness, analysts agreed that a replay of the peso crisis two years ago is unlikely.</p>
<p>Walter Molano, Latin America economist at SBC/Warburg, echoing the majority opinion, said: &quot;The peso is not outrageously overvalued; there are no current account domestic debt problems; and the central bank has definitely learned lessons from the past experience.&quot;</p>
