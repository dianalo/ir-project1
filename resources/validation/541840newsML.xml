<p>Finland and Canada went into the ice hockey world championships as joint favourites but Sweden and the Czech Republic upset the odds on Sunday with a pair of surprise wins which makes them the tournament's only remaining unbeaten teams.</p>
<p>Looking to erase embarrassing memories of a sixth place finish at last year's tournament, Olympic champions Sweden scored twice in each of the first two periods and added three more in the third to crush Canada 7-2.</p>
<p>At the same time, in Helsinki, a sell-out crowd of 13,279 watched disbelievingly as Martin Prochazka scored twice to lead the defending champions Czech Republic past Finland 2-1.</p>
<p>A year ago few expected the Czech Republic to win the world title.</p>
<p>This year, after struggling with internal problems including the forced resignation of Ludek Bukac, the man who guided them to their first world championship, even fewer believed they were capable of defending the crown.</p>
<p>But, after two games, the Czechs top the A Pool standings with a perfect 2-0 and have gone 10 games, stretching back to the 1995 championships, without a loss.</p>
<p>Sweden took advantage of some undisciplined play by Canada to climb to the top of the B Pool standings with an identical 2- 0 record.</p>
<p>The Canadians were in penalty trouble from the opening face-off finishing with a total of 55 minutes, including a 20-minute misconduct to Cory Cross for cross-checking Michael Nylander into the boards.</p>
<p>Nylander paced the Olympic champions with a pair of goals while Jonas Hoglund, Tommy Albelin, Stefan Nilsson, Magnus Arvedson and Nichlas Falk also scored.</p>
<p>Jarome Iginla and Dean Evason tallied for Canada but only after the game was out of reach.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope our team learned a lesson tonight,&quot; said Canadian coach Andy Murray.</p>
<p>&quot;More than half our team has no international experience at this level and I think they've realised tonight that to be successful over here they're going to have to play a lot smarter and with more discipline.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously it's a different type of game than what NHL players are use to.&quot;</p>
<p>In other A Pool action in Helsinki, Russia took a 1-0 lead after just 16 seconds with a goal by Sergei Petrenko but had to come back to earn a 2-2 tie with Slovakia.</p>
<p>After Petrenko's shock opener, one of the quickest opening goals in championship history, Slovakia got a pair of second period goals from Jozef Dano and Zdenko Ciger but Andrei Skopintsev earned Russia the draw with an equaliser halfway through the last period.</p>
<p>The United States, looking for their first title in 64 years, also needed a late third period goal to squeeze past Latvia 5-4 in their championship opener.</p>
<p>Washington Capital winger Todd Krygier stalled a determined comeback bid by the Latvians when he picked up his own rebound and snapped a wristshot past Juris Klodans with just 6:23 remaining in the game.</p>
<p>Until then the Americans had watched their 4-1 lead evaporate as Latvia, playing in the world championships as an independent nation for the first time since 1939, stormed back into the contest with three third period goals from Leonids Tambijevs, Aleksandrs Belavakis and Andrei Ignatovics.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe our team fell asleep,&quot; said American coach Jeff Jackson. &quot;I think they went out in the third period and thought they would have an easy time.&quot;</p>
<p>Vancouver Canuck enforcer Donald Brashear, Paul Ranheim of the Hartford Whalers, Chris Tancill and Brian Berard rounded out the U.S. scoring. Sergei Cudinovs had the other Slovakian goal.</p>
