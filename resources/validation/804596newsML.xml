<p>Forces loyal to Cambodian strongman Hun Sen pounded approaches to the border town of O'Smach with mortar and artillery fire on Sunday as they closed in on the last major stronghold of opposition royalist forces.</p>
<p>At least 22 mortar rounds and nine artillery shells landed in the town's outskirts during the morning and the Thai army had been moved to full alert in case the fighting or shelling spilled across the Thai border, a Thai army commander said.</p>
<p>Defending royalist troops had ordered civilians to remain in their houses or in bunkers and the number of casualties in the town was not immediately known, he said.</p>
<p>In the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, General Meas Sophea, who heads fighting operations, said government troops had advanced to within 2-3 km (1-2 miles) of O'Smach.</p>
<p>&quot;We are 2-3 km from O'Smach, but because of the density of landmines and booby traps in the area, it is difficult to take O'Smach,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Another military official in Phnom Penh said the government was pressing its advance with infantry but no tanks or heavy equipment due to the terrain. From Cambodia, access to O'Smach is via a steep dirt road and the surrounding area is jungle.</p>
<p>Twelve injured government soldiers were flown to the Siem Reap military hospital 60 km to the south of O'Smach on Sunday.</p>
<p>Three were wounded by mines, three by artillery and four by grenade launchers, hospital officials said.</p>
<p>A colonel in Siem Reap said about 5,000 government troops were now in the O'Smach area and a further five divisions were in Samrong, 40 km (25 miles) south of O'Smach.</p>
<p>Government troops had surrounded O'Smach, and controlled all but the town and a narrow corridor from O'Smach toward the headquarters of the once feared Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement at Anlong Veng about 50 km (39 miles) to the east, he said.</p>
<p>The much weakened Khmer Rouge have sent troops to reinforce royalist positions in O'Smach. They fear capture of the town by Hun Sen's forces would give the government an easier advance toward their base of Anlong Veng, Thai army sources said.</p>
<p>The number of Cambodian civilians crowding at the Thai border in the hope of fleeing the fighting had dwindled to a few dozen following the order by royalist commanders for civilians to stay at home.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the royalists) might ask to let the civilians cross tonight but not in daylight. It is too embarrassing for them...they have been told to stay away from the cameras,&quot; said one Thai commander at the border.</p>
<p>On Saturday hundreds of ragged families carrying their possessions crowded around the barbed wired border gates hoping to cross into Thailand. The Thais have promised to let them in if the situation worsens.</p>
<p>About 75 scared civilians attempting to cross the border through surrounding jungle late on Saturday had been sent back to Cambodia, Thai troops said.</p>
<p>Ranariddh's forces have been defending dwindling pockets of territory in the country's northwest since Hun Sen seized power after two days of bloody fighting in Phnom Penh on July 5-6. The two were formerly co-premiers in a shaky coalition government.</p>
