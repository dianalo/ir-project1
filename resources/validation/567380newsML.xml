<headline>Chrysler, UAW to resume local talks.</headline>

<p>Bargainers for Chrysler Corp. and the United Auto Workers union were scheduled to meet late Tuesday, according to sources familiar with the situation, indicating a possible break in a nearly month-old strike that has paralyzed production of some high-profit vehicles.</p>
<p>Up to now communication has been limited to intermittent conversations between senior company and union officials. There have been next to no local talks since the strike began April 9. Company and UAW officials declined to comment on the new talks.</p>
<p>The strike by 1,856 UAW members at Chrysler's Mound Road engine plant in Detroit has paralyzed high-profit pickup truck and sport utility production at the U.S. No. 3 automaker. The walkout has idled a total of 18,916 workers.</p>
<p>Workers are demanding Chrysler drop plans to shift production of drive shafts to an outside supplier, which the union says would cost it 300 jobs.</p>
<p>Including the Chrysler employees, about 28,200 union workers at General Motors Corp. and Chrysler are either on strike or idled because of labor disputes at three plants in the United States.</p>
<p>GM said Tuesday it will suspend assembly operations at its Windsor transmission plant in Ontario on Friday because of a strike in Oklahoma City, Okla., that began April 4.</p>
<p>About 250 members of the Canadian Auto Worker Local 1973 who work on two shifts will be idled. The plant employs a total of 1,500 hourly workers.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, GM and Chrysler have lost production of 119,122 vehicles, many of those high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, according to Michael Robinet, managing director of CSM Forecasting Inc., a consultant in Farmington Hills, Mich.</p>
<p>Analysts estimated last week the Chrysler strike alone had cost the automaker $300 million -- a figure that is growing by $15 million to $20 million a day.</p>
<p>Union and company representatives Tuesday reported slight progress on resolving the GM strikes. At the Oklahoma City car plant, where 3,500 UAW members walked off the job, a union spokeswoman said bargainers have resolved some minor issues and have moved on to more major concerns.</p>
<p>At the other GM strike, in Pontiac, Mich., a spokesman for UAW Local 594 said negotiators have made little headway in addressing the major outsourcing and staffing issues at the center of that dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very, very slow, very slow,&quot; said the spokesman, who would not give his name.</p>
<p>About 5,850 members of Local 594 struck GM's Pontiac East full-size pickup truck assembly plant and related facilities on April 22. The plant typically makes about 6,000 of the popular extended cab pickup models a week. Union members want GM to address health and safety issues and add up to 600 jobs.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate the Pontiac strike is costing GM $4.5 million to $5 million a day, while the Oklahoma City walkout is costing less.</p>
