<title>FRANCE: Paris store employee faked bomb scare - police.</title>
<headline>Paris store employee faked bomb scare - police.</headline>

<p>A security guard at a Paris clothing store has admitted faking a bomb scare last weekend which he initially blamed on three men of North African origin, a police spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>The scare has now been reclassified as a false alarm, one of 441 recorded in the capital since the rush-hour bombing of a Paris commuter train on December 3 in which four people died, police said.</p>
<p>Police did not release the name of the man, who was still being questioned, and it was not yet known if he would be charged with a crime.</p>
<p>The police official said the guard had acknowledged lying when he told authorities that he had come across three men in the store where he worked handling a gas canister, nails and bolts, and had attempted to question them.</p>
<p>The bomb used in the commuter train attack had similar components.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that had even cut himself after initially telling police that the three men had slashed him with a linoleum cutter before making their escape.</p>
<p>A few days later, police found the man tied up in the back seat of his car in a Paris suburb. He said he had been kidnapped at his home by four men who questioned and then threatened him.</p>
<p>But that, too, was a fabrication, police said.</p>
<p>It was unclear why the guard had fabricated the incidents, the official said.</p>
<p>Security has been sharply stepped up in Paris following the train bombing.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of the bomb scares since the train bombing have concerned suspicious packages abandoned or forgotten in public places, the police said.</p>
