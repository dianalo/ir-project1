<p>Counterfeiters have for the first time succeeded in forging the new improved U.S. $100 bills, Russian police said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Police in St. Petersburg arrested three men outside the city's main department store after they tried to pass off fakes of the new $100 bills, introduced by Washington amid great fanfare in March 1996 as a breakthrough against counterfeiters.</p>
<p>&quot;Experts are now trying to establish how and where these bills were made because their quality was very high and practically all level of defences were reproduced on the fake bills,&quot; said Marina Kozlova, a spokeswoman for the city police anti-organised crime division.</p>
<p>The arrests, which took place on January 6 and were not announced previously, appear to be the first of their kind in Russia, a country where many keep their savings in $100 bills as a hedge against rouble inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as we know there have been no other cases of forged new $100 bills,&quot; said Yelena Smolyak, a spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry's economic crime division in Moscow.</p>
<p>The arrested men carried 14 false $100 bills, and another $6,000 worth was found after a search of one of the detained men's homes.</p>
<p>Two of the arrested men had been convicted previously, one for murder and the other for unlawful foreign curerncy operations, police said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, police in Lithuania also said they had arrested two people with fake new $100 bills, Interfax news agency reported.</p>
