<p>Priceless crown jewels from Russia's imperial past -- caught up in a standoff between Russian and American art lovers -- were moved on Monday from an art gallery vault to the Russian Embassy.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Corcoran Gallery of Art, a stone's throw from the White House, said the crown jewels were moved by armoured car to the embassy.</p>
<p>Where they go from the embassy was the subject of bargaining. However, American and Russian negotiators hoped to reach an agreement on where the priceless pieces from Russia's czarist days should go next -- Russia or Texas.</p>
<p>Russia told American cultural promoters this month it wanted the jewels back. That began an international art world dispute with the Americans, who said there were contracts to show the gems next in Houston, San Diego, California, and Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
<p>While negotiators expressed hope earlier on Monday that the dispute could end, the talks dragged on at a hotel without any apparent breakthrough, a spokesman announced later.</p>
<p>At one point, the American-Russian Cultural Foundation scheduled a news conference between the chief American and Russian bargainers, former congressman James Symington, a Missouri Democrat, and deputy Russian culture minister Mikhail Shvidkoy, who came here from Moscow for the bargaining.</p>
<p>But as reporters waited for the principals to arrive, a spokesman for the foundation, Brian Gaudet, showed up instead, cancelled the conference between principals and said talks would continue.</p>
<p>Gaudet said &quot;legal matters&quot; were the big hurdles but added &quot;we want to make sure it gets done right.&quot; The Russians, he said, also want an independent audit on the proceeds and expenses involved in the shows. Proceeds will be shared with the Russians.</p>
<p>Gaudet announced that the State Department had intervened and named a special mediator to help settle the dispute. He is former American Express executive Andrew Somers, who is an entrepreneur building hotels in Russia.</p>
<p>Asked why the jewels were moved to the embassy, Gaudet said that it was a matter of goodwill. While he conceded the Russians now have the precious articles, he said that international contract law was on the side of the Americans.</p>
<p>For nearly two weeks, negotiators from Russia and the foundation, which helped arrange an American tour of the artifacts, have been wrangling over the treasure's next destination.</p>
<p>For 10 weeks until April 13, the jewels, costumes and art had been on view at the Corcoran before capacity crowds. More than 80,000 people paid $9 each.</p>
<p>The collection was then to be shipped to Houston for the next stop on what would be a nationwide tour. But the Russians balked, blocking a truck containing some of the artwork from moving until it was allowed last week to go to the Russian Embassy until the matter of the next stop was settled.</p>
<p>Russia has said it wanted the treasures back for Moscow's 850th birthday celebration in May, according to the Corcoran, but the American sponsors argued that would violate the agreement to bring the treasures in the United States for the tour.</p>
