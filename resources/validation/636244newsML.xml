<p>Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien voiced satisfaction on Wednesday with the decline in the Quebec separatist vote in Monday's federal election.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a very serious decline in the vote of the Bloc Quebecois in Quebec, despite what they say. It is the lowest score by any separatist party in Quebec since 1973, and that is very significant,&quot; Chretien told a news conference.</p>
<p>The Bloc Quebecois, dedicated to winning independenc for Quebec, was bumped from the position of official opposition in the Canadian Parliament by the Reform Party.</p>
<p>The Bloc won 44 seats, 10 fewer than in 1993, and its share of the vote in the province shrank to 38 percent from 49 percent.</p>
<p>Separatists scored 49.4 percent in a 1995 referendum on whether Quebec should become sovereign after making an offer of partnership to Canada, but polls during the 1997 election campaign also showed decline in support on that question.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll, taken by Zogby International in the middle of the campaign, showed only 42.1 percent saying they would vote yes if the 1995 referendum question were asked today, with 57.9 percent opposed.</p>
<p>For much of his mandate, Chretien had to face separatist firebrand Lucien Bouchard, now Quebec premier, across the aisle in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>&quot;When I read in the press and I look at the good old days when Lucien Bouchard was leader of the opposition, for me it was not the good old days,&quot; Chretien said.</p>
<p>He pointedly praised the Conservative and New Democratic parties for their position on national unity.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that we have two parties with national outlooks with seats in the House of Commons, that is very positive,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chretien added that the separatists running the Quebec government &quot;should look at the reality of the meaning of that vote for them.&quot;</p>
<p>Chretien asserted that to try to rescue a flagging Bloc campaign, separatists went all out in the final 10 days.</p>
<p>&quot;They said that is the equivalent of a quasi-referendum, and they started talking about having more than 50 percent of the vote and 60 seats,&quot; Chretien declared.</p>
<p>Some of the Bloc vote went to the Conservative Party, which under former prime minister Brian Mulroney had gone to great lengths to accommodate Quebec demands.</p>
