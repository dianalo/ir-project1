<p>Former Turkish prime minister Tansu Ciller's legal problems mounted on Wednesday when a leftist MP asked prosecutors to investigate allegations that her businessman husband, Ozer, was implicated in a murder.</p>
<p>The state-run Anatolian news agency said deputy Fikri Saglar urged the chief prosecutor's office in a written request to look into claims that Ozer Ciller &quot;encouraged the killing&quot; of casino owner Omer Lutfu Topal in Istanbul last July.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe an inquiry must be launched into the links between (Ozer Ciller) and both the death of Topal and the suspects in the murder,&quot; Anatolian quoted Saglar's request as saying.</p>
<p>Neither member of the Ciller family was immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Three policemen who also served as the bodyguards for an MP from Tansu Ciller's conservative True Path Party are on trial after they were alleged to have shot Topal dead in a battle over laundered money from the heroin trade.</p>
<p>Saglar, from the Republican People's Party, was a member of a parliamentary commission earlier this year that investigated Topal's murder as part of a security scandal linking state officials to criminal gangs.</p>
<p>Ozer Ciller was quizzed by prosecutors last week for alleged falsification of a declaration of the family's wealth.</p>
<p>Tansu Ciller became Turkey's first women prime minister in 1993 and later held various cabinet posts. She left office last week after her coalition with Islamist former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan collapsed.</p>
<p>She is herself being investigated by a court after allegations by a far-left leader that she acted against the national interest for financial gain. Both Cillers deny any wrongdoing.</p>
