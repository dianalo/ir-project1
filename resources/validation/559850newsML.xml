<title>USA: MSRB to propose new standards for bond syndicates.</title>
<headline>MSRB to propose new standards for bond syndicates.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-05-05</dateline>

<p>The MSRB said on Monday it will propose rules before the end of May that are designed to tighten disclosure and other standards for municipal bond syndicates.</p>
<p>The 15-member Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which met late last week in closed session, said it will propose an amendment to its syndicate practices rule G-11 that would require bond underwriters to disclose to market participants certain issuer requirements for bond syndicates.  </p>
<p>Underwriters would have to distribute to market participants information on syndicate formation, order review, designation policies and bond allocations, according to the rule which the board plans to propose before the end of May, board officials said.</p>
<p>Underwriters also would have to keep records showing they distributed the information, board officials said during the telephone media briefing.</p>
<p>Board Chairman Roger Hayes also said the board will propose that bonds be allocated within 24 hours of sending the the so-called &quot;commitment wire.&quot;</p>
<p>And the new rule would require quicker settlement of syndicate accounts and payment of designations, Hayes said. Also it would require more disclosures between syndicate managers and members concerning designations and allocations.</p>
<p>The proposal follows a broad MSRB survey of market participants to determine if board rules governing bond syndicate  practices need tightening.</p>
<p>A key issue is whether smaller, less influential syndicate members are getting unfair allocations by senior managers. Firms have complained for years that senior managers keep most of the bonds for themselves on good deals and distribute them evenly only for poorly received offerings.</p>
