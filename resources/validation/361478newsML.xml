<p>U.S. spot residual fuel prices mostly lost ground Wednesday in quiet trade despite forecasts for colder weather next week, pressured by ample supplies and still-sluggish utility demand, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Resid is a dog. There's more around than we need,&quot; said one cash trader, noting supplies were ample, gas was getting cheaper and there was little utility or industrial interest.</p>
<p>In New York Harbor, physical one percent slipped about a quarter to the $17.75 a barrel level, with March paper also talked slightly lower at $17.35-60 on weaker crude, traders said.  </p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour notionally gained slightly to the $20.50 area but most agreed competitive East Coast city gate gas prices should cap further advances.</p>
<p>Traders said 10,000 barrels of prompt NYH 0.3 percent low pour sold at $21.75, unchanged on the day.</p>
<p>High sulphur in New York remained pressured by plentiful supply, with 2.2 percent down 25-50 cents to the $16.25 area.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, one percent held steady at $16.50, while three percent slid a quarter to $14.00-25. No USG deals were reported.</p>
<p>Traders said concerns about Star's refinery coker maintenance this month, which was pumping 50,000 bpd of extra HSFO, continued to weigh on the market.</p>
<p>New York city gate swing gas prices stayed little changed in the low-$3.00/mmBtu area. NYH one percent resid was at a $2.82/mmBtu equivalent.</p>
