<p>Premiums for European Union (EU) white sugar stayed on the low side over the past week despite the lack of availability of prompt cargoes as buyers opted to wait for the new crop to start trickling out, brokers said.</p>
<p>High futures prices have also deterred buyers, who are likely to try and defer their requirements until next month when the new crop will be priced and December will be spot position.</p>
<p>EU premiums for prompt cargoes were quoted at between $15 and $17 over October, compared with $23 just two weeks ago, but few trades have been reported. &quot;The premiums are coming down but the futures are staying up. Until they come off, nobody can sell any sugar and they're getting more and more desperate,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;The majority (of buyers) have probably covered most of their needs for the immediate moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said they expected white sugar futures to edge back as they were widely held to be overpriced and this year's round of beet tests had not produced any real market surprises so far.</p>
<p>While EU sugar from the 1996/97 crop is not expected to be available in any sizeable quantity until the latter half of October, a limited number of cargoes could still emerge before then and lure buyers, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The time factor is getting shorter so people can hold on one month or three weeks and then they have the October sugar,&quot; said a physical broker.</p>
<p>&quot;They only have to hold out another three weeks and then they have the October pricing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One EU sugar analyst said some north European producers might already be considering advancing the start of the new crop, ensuring some degree of availability throughout October.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure offtake will come, it is just a matter of the sugar being there,&quot; the broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no sugar available at the moment anyhow in September. From October, when there is plenty of sugar, there will also be plenty of buyers.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers say EU premiums should remain low in 1997 compared with previous years as demand for 45 ICUMSA whites will decline as traditional EU buyers -- particularly some in the Middle East -- turn to lesser-quality material.</p>
<p>The two new refineries in the region are also expected to provide extra competition.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets which traditionally only took 45s are changing,&quot; the trader said. &quot;Next year there's going to be much less demand for EUs.&quot;</p>
<p>South Brazil, the EU's seasonal rival as a supplier of quality white sugar, is not providing much competition while its key port of Santos sees its usual strikes and queues of vessels.</p>
<p>&quot;September/October (cargoes) are rumoured to be offered at $5 under (October) so it's not really hot competition for the EU,&quot; said another broker. &quot;It's not going to cover the freight...(but) it's good for the western hemisphere markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But while congestion at Santos is greatly improved after last year's weeks of delays, freight rates have fallen because of the thin physical demand and reduced numbers of vessels.</p>
