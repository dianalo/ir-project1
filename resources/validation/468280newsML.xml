<title>USA: NYMEX oil complex suffers 'technical meltdown'.</title>
<headline>NYMEX oil complex suffers 'technical meltdown'.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>The NYMEX oil complex suffered a &quot;technical meltdown&quot; in the final hour of trade Wednesday afternoon after a day that saw crude hold support then test resistance in the earlier going, traders.</p>
<p>Whether crude or gasoline led the breakdown remained a subject of disagreement, but with a lack of substantial news in the market, no one denied the fall was technical in nature.</p>
<p>&quot;It was basically a technical meltdown,&quot; said one floor trader who linked the move to May crude, which turned its back on bullish inventory data and ended up shedding 35 cents and settling a $20.64 a barrel.  </p>
<p>May crude plunged through a congested area of support between $20.80 and $20.90 a barrel in the final half hour of trade, with support now seen at levels including $20.15, $20 and $19.78, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything technical I had got blown away. We're back to square one,&quot; said another trader, who watched what he had identified as a reverse head and shoulders formation on May gasoline melt down in the final turbulent half hour.</p>
<p>April gasoline lost 1.70 cents and settled at 64.82 cents a gallon, while April heating oil, going along for the ride, lost 1.40 cents ending at 55.43 cents a gallon.  </p>
<p>&quot;Which one decided to head down? I'm going to say it was gasoline. But it's hard to say,&quot; said Tom Bentz, analyst at ING Derivatives Clearing in New York.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of the length that was in the market bailed out when it went below 66.00 cents,&quot; Bentz said. Other sources see the next support at 64.40.</p>
<p>Some sources said there were clear fundamental factors that justified the drop, including a still-sloppy North Sea crude market, as well as voluminous blendstock imports hiding deep in the American Petroleum Institute's (API) weekly data.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not surprised,&quot; said Jim Ritterbusch, a trader with Sweeney Oil in Chicago who also viewed gasoline as the main influence in the selloff.</p>
<p>He said that while higher refinery runs may bring relief to a well-supplied crude market, it will also bring extra gasoline supplies onto the market.</p>
<p>Others said refiner crack spread selling on gasoline finally caught the attention of locals who were caught long as the market moved through its support levels Wednesday.</p>
<p>The May gasoline-to-crude crack spread lost 40 cents Wednesday, settling at $6.37 a barrel.</p>
<p>Still, some traders said the sharp selloff, while rather precipitous, did not violate the three-week uptrend seen in NYMEX markets.</p>
<p>&quot;It is in danger of breaking its three-week uptrend, but I am not ready at this point to throw in the bullish towel,&quot; said Gerald Samuels, managing director of ARB Oil.</p>
