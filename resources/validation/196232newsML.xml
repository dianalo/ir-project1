<p>Romanians elected reformist Emil Constantinescu president on Sunday, throwing veteran leader Ion Iliescu out of office and ending the iron grip ex-communists have held on power since the 1989 revolution.</p>
<p>Exit polls put Constantinescu seven to eight percent ahead of Iliescu, who came to power in 1989 with the overthrow and execution of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Iliescu conceded defeat without waiting for the official results.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a victory for millions of Romanians who lived through years of repression and kept their faith for a better life,&quot; Constantinescu told cheering campaign workers.</p>
<p>Many opposition figures accused ex-communists of hijacking the 1989 revolution to seize power. For them Sunday's victory was the final, long-delayed overthrow of Ceausescu's followers and the finale to the revolution.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of young people poured into Bucharest's University Square to celebrate their triumph at the site of the first deaths in the city in the 1989 revolt and of miners riots that crushed opposition forces in 1990 and 1991.</p>
<p>Speaking from the same balcony he used to address students in 1990, Constantinescu told the roaring crowd: &quot;You have made this place the starting point of democracy&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Iliescu's gone&quot; many chanted triumphantly. Others popped champagne corks or jangled keys, the symbol of Constantinescu's Democratic Convention group that will form the new government.</p>
<p>Cars raced down central boulevards, their horns blaring and firecrackers exploded in the streets.</p>
<p>Iliescu, who held several senior posts under dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, was contrite in defeat and pledged to form a constructive opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;The forces which have won must assume responsibility for tackling the profound problems of the country. I hope they will do it with professionalism and without vendetta,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He later told a television interviewer he had believed he was going to win the election.</p>
<p>The outcome ended Romania's status as the one Eastern European country where anti-communists have not held power and stands to improve the country's image abroad.</p>
<p>It consolidated the electoral rout two weeks ago of Iliescu's leftist Party of Social Democracy, thrown out of government for the first time since December 1989.</p>
<p>A new centrist government is to be formed within days. It is commmitted to a programme of tax cuts and improved benefits combined with financial discipline to bridge the gap in living standards with near neighbours Hungary and Poland.</p>
<p>Constantinescu accused Iliescu of seven years of corrupt mismanagement that had left Romanians in poverty with average monthly salaries of less than $100.</p>
<p>The president vowed during the campaign to shield Romanians against the excesses of market economics and told voters his rival would restore exiled King Michael and pre-war landlords bent on reclaiming their homes and closing factories.</p>
<p>Constantinescu appeared to owe his victory to a high turnout in areas which traditionally backed the opposition -- Transylvania, home to 1.6 million ethnic Hungarians and big cities hit by Romania's post-communist economic decline.</p>
<p>Lower turnouts were recorded in rural areas, where less educated voters traditionally supported the president.</p>
<p>Constantinescu's backers also celebrated in other cities, including Timisoara, where the 1989 revolution began and in Cluj and Sibiu.</p>
