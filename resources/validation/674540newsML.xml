<headline>Over third of Australians now own shares - survey.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-06-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Over a third of Australians now own shares either directly or indirectly, up from just under 20 percent three years ago, an Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) sponsored survey released on Thursday has found.</p>
<p>&quot;Direct share ownership levels now rival other major Western economies such as the U.K. and Canada,&quot; ASX Managing Director Richard Humphrey told a news conference announcing the survey results.  </p>
<p>The survey of 2,400 adult Australians in May this year found the level of direct and indirect ownership of Australian shares rose to 34.0 percent from 19.9 percent in 1994 and 14.7 percent in 1991.</p>
<p>The bulk of this rise came in indirect share-ownership, fuelled by a tripling in the amount of money contributed to managed superannuation funds to A$10.3 billion over that time.</p>
<p>The level of indirect only share-ownership surged to 13.6 percent from 3.9 percent in 1994 and 4.5 percent in 1991. Direct only share-ownership actually fell to 11.9 percent from 12.8 percent in 1994, but was up on 8.8 percent in 1991.  </p>
<p>The level of both indirect and direct share-ownership rose to 8.5 percent from 3.2 percent three years ago and 1.4 percent in 1991, again reflecting the boom in funds under management.</p>
<p>Humphrey said the sharp rise in share-ownership by private Australians was driven by three factors, including;</p>
<p>* the large public floats like Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd, Woolworths Ltd and Qantas Airways which were often marketed at private investors,</p>
<p>* the baby-boomer demographic bulge saving for retirement and government policies encouraging retirement savings, and,</p>
<p>* more accesible stockbrokers and market education.  </p>
<p>Humphrey said the Internet was about to spark a revolution in share trading and would dramatically increase the proportion of Australians owning shares over the next three years.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd put it on the same level as the invention of the telephone. It's the invention that gives people broader access to just about anything, particularly the markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The ASX was processing an application from U.S. based-Internet broker E-Cash to set up a electronic trading home page, he said, adding that the ASX's own information home page was the second most popular Australian page after the electronic Yellow Pages.  </p>
<p>The big jump in the proportion of Australians owning shares had not however translated into a higher proportion of the Australian market being owned by individuals because market capitalisation had doubled to about A$400 billion over that time.</p>
<p>The proportion of this market capitalisation owned by individuals was steady at around 22 percent between 1994 and 1997, while foreign ownership of Australian shares had risen to 31.2 percent from 30 percent in 1994, Humphrey said.</p>
<p>Other changes evident in the latest survey of share-ownership included;  </p>
<p>* the average share transaction has risen to A$7,100 from A$5,700, while the average portfolio rose to A$33,300 from A$26,000,</p>
<p>* the proportion of women owning shares rose to 28.3 percent from 17.1 percent, while the proportion of men owning shares rose to 40.2 percent from 22.8 percent.</p>
<p>* the proportion of privately-owned shares owned by those in the 45-54 age group, seen as baby-boomers, rose to 22.9 percent from 15.6 percent.  </p>
<p>* those in the A$50,000 to A$70,000 annual income demographic are the most likely to own shares, making up 19.7 percent of shareholders, compared with 12.4 percent in the A$100,000 plus group and 4.2 percent in the lower than A$20,000 group.</p>
