<p>Lima shares rose slightly Friday for the fourth consecutive day, led again by polymetallic stocks on expectations of future zinc price rises, brokers said.</p>
<p>They expected the market to be stable or positive at the beginning of next week, thanks to good prospects for miners, expectations of healthy first half corporate results and the return of U.S. investors after the Independence Day holiday.</p>
<p>According to preliminary figures, the Lima Stock Exchange's general index  .IGRA climbed 0.87 percent to 2,248.02 points, while the blue-chip selective index  .ISEL also rose 1.15 percent to 3,263.07 points.  </p>
<p>Overall, 40 million soles ($15.3 million) was traded in 2,374 transactions.</p>
<p>Analysts recommended investors maintain positions in the polymetallic sector, construction and breweries. They also recommended selling shares from the electric sector before the damaging weather phenomenon El Nino.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are centering in the polymetallics because zinc will maintain its high price in the following weeks, after a few logical corrections,&quot; said analyst Francisco Lopez from Fortuna brokerage, referring to the zinc price's slight dip today to $1.458 per ton.  </p>
<p>The market was further encouraged by rumors of good financial results in the polymetallic sector during the second quarter according to Manuel Torres from brokerage Finvest.</p>
<p>The biggest winners Friday were miners Morococha up 10.09 percent to 8.29 soles, Perubar, up 8.81 percent to 8.65 soles and Milpo with an 8.71 percent rise to 47.94 soles.</p>
<p>Also gaining were Minera Atacocha with its common shares and labor shares up 3.51 percent to 2.95 soles and 5.76 percent to 2.94 soles respectively.</p>
<p>Losers included electricity company Edelnor, down 0.99 percent to 2.01 soles, Luz del Sur, off 0.64 percent to 3.10 soles, and tin miner Minsur, which lost 0.3 percent to 9.99 soles.</p>
<p>Minsur lost ground on unstable tin prices.</p>
<p>The market leader Telefonica del Peru lost 0.29 percent to drop to 6.98 soles.</p>
