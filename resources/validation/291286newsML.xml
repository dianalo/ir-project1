<headline>Europe needs &quot;dose of British pragmatism&quot; - Major.</headline>
<dateline>THE HAGUE 1997-01-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>British Prime Minister John Major pledged on Tuesday to continue to play a constructive role within the European Union and dismissed speculation that he might run an anti-European general election campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;I've never been in the business of running a &quot;Eurosceptical' election campaign. Britain has some very genuine concerns about how Europe is developing. There's no secret about that,&quot; he told reporters after a working dinner in The Hague with Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok who currently holds the EU presidency.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no question of Britain leaving the European Union. We wish to play a constructive part in the European Union.&quot;</p>
<p>Acknowledging that Britain and its 14 partners were still divided over key issues -- such as employment policy and a move to majority voting that would curtail use of the national veto -- Major said the Union could benefit from &quot;a good dose of British pragmatism&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not just concerned about the British position in Europe. I am concerned about what the developments that some of our colleagues in Europe wish to see would mean for the development of the European Union as a whole,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been (EU) members now for a quarter of a century. We are in...and we are going to stay in...</p>
<p>&quot;In many areas we have a different perspective of how the Union should...develop from our partners, but there should be no doubt that we want it to succeed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It may be that from time to time we are an uncomfortable partner but...(that) is because we form an honest and sincere judgement that what Europe is doing is not right, either for Europe or for us, and we will continue to say so.&quot;</p>
<p>Major, whose ruling Conservative Party has held power for over 17 years, must go to the polls by May 22, only weeks before a June Amsterdam summit is scheduled to agree landmark EU reforms ahead of the 15-member bloc's planned enlargement.</p>
