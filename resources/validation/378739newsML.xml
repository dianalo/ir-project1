<headline>CBOT corn ends narrowly mixed as funds shift focus.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-02-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT corn futures closed narrowly mixed with the market underpinned by a shift in focus by funds to the corn pit from the soybean pit, traders said.</p>
<p>Funds bought at least 20 million bushels of corn with Griffin Trading the key purchaser of eight million bushels of March, 2.5 million of May and one million bushels of July, traders said. Smith Barney bought six million May and Cargill Inc sold six million bushels of March, they said.</p>
<p>Fundamentals were little changed with U.S. corn exports continuing at a steady pace and farmer selling remained sporadic.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be a little unwinding of the bean/corn spreads because soybeans really took off this week and corn didn't,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Position squaring was noted before the three day weekend. CBOT futures markets will be closed Monday in observance of the U.S. President's Day holiday. Position also was noted before the release late Friday of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commitments of Traders report.</p>
<p>Corn closed 3/4 cent per bushel lower to 1/4 higher, with March down 1/2 at $2.74.  </p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 46,000 contracts, slightly above the 45,303 traded Thursday.</p>
<p>In corn options, Farmers Commodities Corp sold 600 May $2.70 puts at five to 5-3/8 cents and Goldenberg Hehmeyer bought 400 March $2.80 calls at 7/8 cent, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 13,000 contracts, about the same as the 13,130 traded Thursday.</p>
