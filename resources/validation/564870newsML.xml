<headline>Portugal bond auction yields seen in line with mkt.</headline>
<dateline>LISBON 1997-05-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The average weighted interest rate at today's auction of 10-year Portuguese fixed rate bonds should come out between 6.65 and 6.70 percent, in line with levels in the secondary market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Results of today's auction are due around 1000 GMT.</p>
<p>The dealers said they were unsure if all 25 billion escudos of the bonds would be placed, because of the light presence recently of institutional investors in the secondary market.</p>
<p>At the last auction on April 1, 25 billion escudos of February 2007 bonds were placed at an average weighted interest rate of 7.0565 percent, which compares with 6.66 percent at the close of the secondary market yesterday.</p>
<p>&quot;The average weighted interest rate should come out between 6.65 percent and 6.75 percent,&quot; a fixed income analyst director said. &quot;These values are in line with the secondary market and are possible given the recent optimism in 10-year bonds.&quot;</p>
<p>Another analyst said: &quot;Most of the demand will be between 6.65 and 6.75 percent, and the average weighted interest rate could come out around 6.70 percent.&quot;</p>
