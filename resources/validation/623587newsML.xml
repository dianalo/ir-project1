<p>Turkish troops consolidated their hold on parts of northern Iraq on Thursday in a two-week-old anti-guerrilla operation which has attracted a steady stream of international protest, state-run Anatolian news agency reported.</p>
<p>Anatolian quoted sources in the region as saying Turkish forces had &quot;taken complete control&quot; of many areas of the Kurdish enclave where Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels were active.</p>
<p>It said among areas under Turkish military control were Snath, Khwakurk, Zap, Sidikan, Nerva, Rekan and Berwani.</p>
<p>Guerrillas and Turkish forces clashed sporadically across the region. On Wednesday evening, troops killed 13 rebels trying to flee into the mountains from Snath, the agency said.</p>
<p>The pro-Kurdish Med TV said 15 soldiers were killed in overnight clashes around Dohuk, Gara Mountain and Amediye. Twenty wounded Turkish troops were evacuated to Sirnak military hospital after the fighting, a Med TV spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>No details of PKK casualties were available, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>At least 10,000 Turkish troops poured into northern Iraq on May 14 in pursuit of PKK rebels who use the region as a base to launch raids into southeast Turkey.</p>
<p>NATO-member Turkey's Western allies and countries in the Middle East have called for the troops to withdraw from the enclave, protected by the West since the Gulf War ended in 1991.</p>
<p>Several hundred demonstrators gathered on Thursday at the Turkish embassy in Baghdad to protest against the incursion.</p>
<p>They waved placards and shouted slogans denouncing both Turkey and Israel and demanding that Ankara withdraw its troops immediately from the area.</p>
<p>&quot;Down, down, down Turkey and Israel,&quot; screamed several demonstrators and others urged Arab states and Baghdad to force &quot;the covetous murderers&quot; out of Iraqi territory.</p>
<p>The demonstration was the first in Baghdad against the invasion. The demonstrators submitted a letter of protest to the Turkish charge d'affaires in the embassy.</p>
<p>Turkey has rebuffed calls to leave the area, protesting at alleged Iranian and Syrian support for the rebels and saying the military offensive is only aimed at the PKK.</p>
<p>&quot;The only target of the military operation in northern Iraq is the PKK terror organisation which has been trying to benefit from the power vacuum in the region to establish itself there,&quot; foreign ministry spokesman Omer Akbel said in a statement.</p>
<p>Turkish military sources have reported a build-up of Iraqi, Iranian and Syrian troops around the enclave. Regional countries have attacked the operation as a violation of Iraqi territory.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Anatolian said Katyusha rockets and supplies of Iranian origin were found among the rebels' possessions.</p>
<p>Fourteen PKK rebels, including three Iranians, a Syrian and an Armenian, were killed in eastern Turkey after crossing the border from Iran, the agency said. It did not say when the fighting took place.</p>
<p>Turkey says it has killed 1,817 PKK guerrillas during the operation in Iraq. Rebel sources say these figures are inflated and the PKK leader put the rebel death toll at only 30.</p>
<p>The operation is being conducted under a strict news blackout, making it impossible to confirm the reports independently.</p>
<p>Rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan has vowed the PKK would retaliate against the military operation with night attacks.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us see what is harder: entering or getting out,&quot; Ocalan said on Med-TV.</p>
<p>Turkey mounted a six-week, 35,000-man operation in the Kurdish-held northern Iraqi regions two years ago but failed to achieve its stated aim of clearing the area of the PKK.</p>
