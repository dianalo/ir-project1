<p>The Sierra Leone government and rebels signed a comprehensive peace accord at a public ceremony in Ivory Coast on Saturday to end nearly six years of civil war that has killed at least 10,000 people.</p>
<p>President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah shook hands and embraced Foday Sankoh, leader of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), after they signed the accord witnessed by Ivorian President Henri Konan Bedie.</p>
<p>Officials involved in the negotiations said the deal followed a last-minute compromise over RUF's insistence on the departure of foreign forces helping the government army.</p>
<p>Tejan Kabbah, who won elections last March and pursued talks with RUF, said the accord had ended &quot;a tortuous period for the people of Sierra Leone&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In effect the war has ended. As from now RUF has ceased to be an enemy of Sierra Leone,&quot; he said. &quot;Our common enemy is poverty, hunger, disease, ignorance, greed and envy.&quot;</p>
<p>Sankoh, also reading from a prepared text, said RUF took up arms to combat corruption and mismanagement.</p>
<p>&quot;Today the battlefield has changed and the bullet has been replaced by the ballot,&quot; Sankoh said.</p>
<p>But he added a warning that his movement, which is to be transfomed into a political party, would not compromise on accountability in government.</p>
<p>&quot;The slogan now is leadership, governance and democracy. If leadership fails, the people will take up arms again,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bedie said the accord did the whole of Africa proud.</p>
<p>&quot;The signing of this accord has considerable significance. It is proof that Africa is capable of resolving its problems,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The peace talks, held under Ivorian mediation since May, stalled for sometime when RUF insisted that Nigerian and Guinean troops and South African mercenaries first leave Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>The officials said under the accord the foreign forces would start leaving when international monitors start taking positions in Sierra Leone. Details of the monitorig are to be worked out through a joint technical committee.</p>
<p>Sankoh, who took up arms in 1991, returned to Ivory Coast from Sierra Leone on Wednesday after talks with his fighters in the bush, during which he sought a mandate to sign.</p>
<p>Sierra Leone had been expecting the signing. State radio there said on Thursday that the government was calling for national celebrations to welcome the return of peace.</p>
<p>Traditional rulers from rebel-held areas in the east said on Wednesday Sankoh's fighters had demanded international monitors to guarantee their safety and disbanding of civil defence units made up of Kamajor traditional hunters before any signing.</p>
<p>The Kamajors had been attacking rebel positions across the nation and the truce extended by Tejan Kabbah and Sankoh in talks in Ivory Coast in April had looked more and more fragile prior to the latest peace developments.</p>
<p>Kabbah, who took office in March after multiparty elections ended four years of army rule, earlier threatened the military option if Sankoh did not agree to peace by December 1.</p>
<p>The civil war in Sierra Leone, a former British colony, has killed at least 10,000 people, according to official estimates.</p>
<p>Rebels who held 17 foreign hostages for months disrupted the country's mainstay bauxite, rutile, diamonds and gold mining industry by forcing foreign-owned mines to close or cut back.</p>
<p>By early 1995 rebels were attacking close to the capital. The government brought in mercenaries from South African firm Executive Outcomes and retook the initiative.</p>
