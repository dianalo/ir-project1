<p>Exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Wednesday called for an end to the growing political row between Australia and China and for the start of talks with Beijing on the future of his tiny kingdom.</p>
<p>&quot;The attitude of confrontation is no use,&quot; the Dalai Lama told the National Press Club here on Wednesday. &quot;The best way to solve this problem is through dialogue.&quot;</p>
<p>Beijing has threatened trade retaliation if Australian Prime Minister John Howard goes ahead with his plan to meet the Dalai Lama during his two-week visit to Australia.</p>
<p>But Howard on Wednesday stood firm on the plan, stressing Australians would expect him to meet one of the world's top religious leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;He is a significant religious leader and it's appropriate in those circumstances, as he's a guest in Australia, that I see him. It would be strange if I didn't,&quot; Howard told reporters during a visit to Jakarta.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama started his visit to Australia last Saturday and has met Foreign Minister Alexander Downer for unofficial talks and spoken to several politicians in Canberra on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Howard, who hopes to meet the Tibetan god-king in Sydney next week if their schedules allow, would not comment on Beijing's trade threats.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to over-react to it. I note what a spokesman for the (Chinese) foreign ministry has said and I'm not going to take it any further,&quot; Howard said.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama said he welcomed Howard's comments and looked forward to meeting the Australian leader, adding he hoped his visit would not harm Australia's trade with China.</p>
<p>Australia exported A$3.1 billion (US$2.4 billion) worth of goods to China in calendar 1995 and imported A$3.8 billion worth from China for a A$737 million trade deficit.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama said he was not seeking Australia, or any other country, to take an anti-Chinese stance on Tibet, but merely apply diplomatic pressure to force China to negotiate.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important to remain firm, but all should remain friendly in their relations with China...,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the Dalai Lama said Beijing had given him no option but to internationalise the Tibetan issue by its failure to enter into meaningful dialogue.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to apeal to you and through you to the international community -- please help us to materialise meaningful negotiation with the Chinese government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am ready to discuss and negotiate...anytime, anywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>Beijing views the Dalai Lama as a political activist who is seeking to split China. The Dalai Lama has been in exile since an abortive uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet in 1959.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama said that while the majority of Tibetans, both inside Tibet and outside, want independence from China, but he was only seeking autonomy.</p>
<p>He said Tibet was a economically backward, landlocked country which needed to join China for its economic development.</p>
<p>&quot;I am seeking genuine autonomy, I am not seeking independence,&quot; said the Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his peaceful campaign for Tibetan autonomy.</p>
<p>&quot;I am ready to join a big nation voluntarily, provided the Chinese treat us as genuine brothers and sisters.&quot;</p>
