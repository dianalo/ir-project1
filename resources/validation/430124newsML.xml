<p>A former Guatemalan guerrilla leader on Monday denied a published report that a leftist Guatemalan rebel front received a secret shipment of weapons from the CIA in 1982.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a false report that doesn't make sense, and making it at this time shows an intent to slander one of the important organisations of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG),&quot; Jorge Soto, formerly Commander Pablo Monsanto, told reporters.</p>
<p>The seemingly contradictory CIA arms shipment to leftist insurgents, reported in Sunday's Miami Herald, would have come at a time when the fight against communism in Central America was a central plank of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan's foreign policy.</p>
<p>But the CIA was trying to lure Eden Pastora, a former military leader in Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, to change sides and join the right-wing Contra rebels, the Herald reported. The purported arms shipments to Pastora's friends in Guatemala would have been a show of faith.</p>
<p>Pastora on Monday lent some credence to the report, saying one of his aides may have requested the arms shipment.</p>
<p>The Herald reported that in February 1982 the CIA secretly shipped a planeload of rifles, ammunition, grenades, grenade launchers and radios to the Revolutionary Organisation of People in Arms (ORPA), one of four rebel groups, also supported by Cuban leader Fidel Castro, to make up the URNG.</p>
<p>The arms shipment -- reportedly dropped by parachute into the jungle, where it was retrieved by the ORPA -- was a closely held secret from U.S. allies in Guatemala City and from most U.S. officials working on Central America policy, the Herald reported.</p>
<p>It was part of the CIA's attempt to recruit Pastora, a military hero of Nicaragua's Sandinista revolution who had broken with his former colleagues. Pastora eventually did take up arms against the Sandinistas, but distanced himself from right-wing elements within the Contra movement.</p>
<p>The Herald said Pastora confirmed the arms were sent, but Pastora on Monday backtracked from that version.</p>
<p>&quot;I never asked the North Americans to send those arms to the Guatemalan guerrillas. But it is possible that one of my assistants would have,&quot; Pastora told Reuters in Managua.</p>
<p>But Pastora said there was a complex web of alliances and strange bedfellows in Central America in the 1980s, recalling that the United States once sold arms to arch-enemy Iran in order to finance the Contras.</p>
<p>&quot;I have received arms from Fidel Castro, from the CIA, from Satan -- all is fair in love and war,&quot; Pastora said.</p>
