<p>Irish government bonds suffered small lossed in moderate late afternoon trade on Wednesday as the Dublin market underperformed in line with stronger UK gilts in London, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade has been reasonable for a last week in August. The UK 10-year auction went very well and good sentiment filtered through to the Dublin market temporarily. UK trade data turned out to be market-positive also,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>By 1515 GMT the eight percent bond due 2000 was down 14p at 103.65 to yield 6.84 percent. The eight percent bond due 2006 fell 17p to 102.65 to yield 7.47 percent.  </p>
<p>Earlier the gilt market in London received a morning boost when UK non-EU trade data showed a 506 million stg deficit versus forecasts of a 900 million stg gap. The June global trade deficit was 1.12 billion stg.</p>
<p>In late morning, the Bank of England's auction of 2.5 bilion stg of 10-year papers was covered 2.69 times and dealers said the news buoyed sentiment in gilts and made them outperform German Bunds.</p>
<p>In a quiet week for Irish economic indicators, July provisional retail sales data on Friday remains the only domestic focus for the Dublin debt market, dealers said.</p>
