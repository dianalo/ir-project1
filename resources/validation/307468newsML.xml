<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan stocks falter above 7,200, end lower.</title>
<headline>Taiwan stocks falter above 7,200, end lower.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-01-14</dateline>

<p>Taiwan shares saw their strong opening evaporate as a surge through six-year resistance at 7,200 sparked late profit-taking against a recent five percent rally, sending the index to a lower close.</p>
<p>The index lost 51.71 points or 0.72 percent to end at 7,137.76, well below a heady midsession high of 7,246.66.</p>
<p>Turnover was heavy at T$90.86 billion.</p>
<p>Brokers noted market jitters above the 7,200 point level.</p>
<p>&quot;This shows investors are scared about the impact of reduced margin-buying (as required by exchange rules) above that level,&quot; said Alex Chen of HSBC James Capel Taiwan.  </p>
<p>Above the level, the margin-buying ratio falls to 50 percent of share prices bought from the current 60 percent investors can borrow from securities financing firms to buy shares.</p>
<p>Brokers said the actual impact should not be serious.</p>
<p>&quot;Incoming funds are mostly long-term ones and are not coming from margin-buying investors. So the impact should be mostly psychological,&quot; Chen said.</p>
<p>Many individual investors, who account for more than 90 percent of the market holdings, have gradually withdrawn their money from banks for stock investments, lured by the market's gain of more than 30 percent in 1996, brokers said.  </p>
<p>The market opened higher on news that the Securities and Exchange Commission has decided to allow foreign non-corporate funds to enter the local stock market, effective immediately.</p>
<p>Brokers said the liberalisation showed the government's continuous bullish attitude toward the market and reform.</p>
<p>Financial, electronics and electric shares -- all recent gainers -- fell most. Car and food shares rose.</p>
<p>Several shares that won franchises to run lucrative mobile new telephone systems in Taiwan late on Monday rose on the news, with Far Eastern Textile up T$1.1 to T$31.1 and Tuntex up 40 cents to T$19.3. Each won two of the eight mobile licences.</p>
