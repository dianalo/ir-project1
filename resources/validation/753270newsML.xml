<p>The White House said Thursday the Republican tax proposal moved in the wrong direction and there would be &quot;no misunderstanding&quot; about its position during meetings with lawmakers.</p>
<p>Thursday's meetings on Capitol Hill were more &quot;reconnoitering&quot; than hard-core negotiations, John Hilley, White House legislative director, said.</p>
<p>Republicans and White House officials said progress was made in meetings that were expected to go on all day.</p>
<p>&quot;We are making progress and narrowing the differences and I think we're moving very positively ahead,&quot; House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer of Texas said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there's now no misunderstanding as to where we are and clearly we have a good feel as to where they are,&quot; White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles said after conferring with House Republicans on taxes.</p>
<p>White House tax negotiators were to meet with Republican senators and Democratic lawmakers later in the day.</p>
<p>Asked whether he had told Republicans which specific areas would provoke a presidential veto, Bowles replied, &quot;there will be no misunderstanding as to those issues which we think would be detrimental&quot; to accomplishing tax cut legislation.</p>
<p>House and Senate Republicans in a unified tax proposal would exempt from taxation profits on investments attributed to inflation. President Clinton strongly opposes that measure.</p>
<p>Republicans and the White House are embroiled in talks over spending and tax measures that would enact the May balanced-budget agreement.</p>
<p>Republicans want to finish the legislation by Aug. 1, while the White House says crafting acceptable legislation was more important than meeting a deadline.</p>
<p>&quot;No deadlines,&quot; Hilley said.</p>
<p>White House Spokesman Mike McCurry said the Republican tax proposal moved in the wrong direction. &quot;We respectfully heard the outline of their proposed bill but our initial assessment is that in most important respects it moves in the wrong direction, not the right direction,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Republicans have rejigged the structure of a $500 per-child tax credit so that it could be kept in a special account for up to three years for low-income families who do not owe income tax after receiving other tax breaks.</p>
<p>Those families would be allowed to receive the child credit once they owed some income tax. The structure of the child credit is a key sticking point with the White House which wants the credit to go to more low-income families, including as a government payment if they owe no income taxes.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said he met with the president Wednesday night and that Clinton agreed on insisting the child credit go to working families who pay payroll taxes but little or no income tax.</p>
<p>The president and Democrats will press for $24 billion over five years to fund a new children's health initiative.</p>
<p>Republicans have agreed to $16 billion, but are deadlocked over a Senate proposal allocating another $8 billion from a proposed 20-cents-per-pack cigarette tax increase. Daschle of South Dakota said Clinton would also keep a close eye on the $115 billion in Medicare spending cuts.</p>
<p>Clinton said he was ready to work in August on tax and spending bills if Congress would delay its planned month-long break, Daschle said. &quot;He's in no hurry. We'd rather have a good bill than a fast bill,&quot; he said.</p>
