<p>Danish share prices closed higher on Monday bolstered by bank advances and gains in other European exchanges despite closed bourses in London and New York, with dealers seeing a quiet day ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;We expected a negative day but we were pulled up by banks and other bourses. It will be quiet tomorrow until the U.S. reopens after its break,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index closed 0.74 point up at 167.10., while the KFX June future rose 0.75 point to 167.00 with 494 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.</p>
<p>Banks were in focus with moderate profit-taking in late trading failing to affect the index. Unidanmark closed five crowns up at 355, while Den Danske Bank put on seven crowns to finish at 626 after peaking at 630.</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk slipped back from a high 710 to end unchanged at 705. Shippers did well on expectations of major insurance windfalls, with Moeller's D/S Svendborg rising 5,000 to 350,000 and Lauritzen going up 10 crowns to 730. Overall turnover for the day was 739 million crowns.</p>
