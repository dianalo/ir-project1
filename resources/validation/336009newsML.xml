<p>James Bond, Britain's famous secret agent, is still waiting for the keys to his new car.</p>
<p>German luxury carmaker BMW AG and Eon Productions of Britain, the company behind the upcoming Bond thriller, on Monday both denied a published report saying Bond would again drive a BMW in a new film slated for release next December.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a red-herring,&quot; BMW spokesman Johannes Schultz said about a weekend report in the Sunday Times of London that BMW has signed a 30 million pound ($49 million) deal to place Ian Fleming's glamour lady-killer behind the wheel of a BMW saloon.</p>
<p>Bond drove a BMW Z3 roadster in his last film, GoldenEye, in a deal that required BMW to include the Bond character in advertising campaigns about the car.</p>
<p>The decision prompted some fans of Bond, known better as the agent 007 with a licence to kill, to criticise the commercialisation of the character as well as question why he was not driving a British vehicle.</p>
<p>Schultz, noting BMW has had a relationship with Bond films since the early 1980s production of &quot;Octopussy&quot;, said BMW was &quot;naturally&quot; in talks with the production company but said a decision had not yet been made on whether a BMW would be used.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not yet have a script for the movie, so we cannot make a decision,&quot; Schultz told Reuters.</p>
<p>Eon spokesman Gordon Arnell said a decision on the vehicle could come as early as late February or early March. He confirmed that BMW was under consideration but declined to say what other vehicles were being reviewed.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no deal yet. We do not start shooting for another two months, so we have time to make a decision about what kind of locomotive power Bond will use,&quot; Arnell said.</p>
<p>The title of the film, the 18th starring Bond, has not yet been announced and details about the film are under wraps.</p>
<p>But some plans for 007 to hunt Russians and Afghans have been divulged in classified advertisements placed in several newspapers near Toulouse, France, this month seeking male extras who look either Russian or Afghan for the upcoming film.</p>
<p>Bond will be played by Pierce Brosnan, who started in GoldenEye. Previous Bonds were Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton. ($1=.6161 Pound)</p>
