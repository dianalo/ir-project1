<p>Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who called an early election last month after riding high in the polls during most of his 3-1/2 years in office, may be having second thoughts as his popularity slides ahead of Monday's vote.</p>
<p>The final polls of the campaign suggested Chretien's Liberals might slip below their level of support in 1993, and again raised the prospect of a minority government.</p>
<p>&quot;Liberals limping to the finish,&quot; read the headline in the Ottawa Citizen on Friday, which published a Southam News-CTV poll conducted by Angus Reid showing Liberal support falling to 36 percent from its 41 percent in the 1993 election.</p>
<p>&quot;The Liberals' chances of forming a majority government on election night next Monday now stand at 50-50,&quot; CTV News said on Thursday night.</p>
<p>In Canada's parliamentary system, elections must be held every five years but the prime minister can call them earlier. Chretien had the choice of waiting until late 1998 before calling this election.</p>
<p>An Environics poll published by Toronto's Globe and Mail on Friday gave the Liberals 39 percent of the decided vote, to 20 percent for the Conservatives and 19 percent for Reform.</p>
<p>The Globe projected that the Liberals could get a majority of 179 of the 301 seats in the House of Commons in Monday's election, but that the numbers did not account for strengths and weaknesses in individual districts.</p>
<p>The Liberals won 177 of the 295 seats in the last Parliament. The secessionist Bloc Quebecois took 54 seats, but looked set to lose many of those and yield its official opposition status to the Western Canada-based Reform Party.</p>
<p>In 1993, Reform -- which advocates tax cuts, smaller government and getting tough on crime and on Quebec separatists -- took 52 seats with 19 percent of the vote, exactly its level in the two latest polls.</p>
<p>The Globe pegged Reform at 55 seats, while the Angus Reid poll suggested 50 to 60 seats.</p>
<p>Chretien pleaded this week for a majority to enable him to stay the course on his economic agenda -- more deficit cutting, followed by increased spending and possible tax cuts.</p>
<p>Chretien went into the election with a lead put variously at 24 to 40 points, but stumbled when reporters asked him to name a single reason for an early election and lost ground as the other four parties attacked him.</p>
<p>Reform's Deborah Grey said: &quot;Now that Mr. Chretien is talking about a minority government...we think the Liberal strategists have decided that they made a king-size mistake here by calling this election now.&quot;</p>
<p>The last Reuters-Zogby tracking poll, released on Thursday, showed a slight recovery for the Liberals to 41.9 percent from 39.7 percent a day earlier, 20 points ahead of the Conservatives.</p>
<p>Gallup Canada released a poll on Thursday night giving the Liberals a 19-point lead at 41 percent and suggesting a Liberal majority.</p>
<p>One of the defining issues, especially in the latter part of the campaign, has been how to handle Quebec separatists.</p>
<p>Reform capitalized on Western discontent with the Quebec separatism issue by running an ad suggesting the country had had enough of Quebec-born leaders.</p>
<p>Chretien, Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe and Conservative leader Jean Charest are all francophone Quebeckers, and Chretien said Manning was intolerant, while Charest called Manning a bigot.</p>
<p>&quot;What we were doing in the ads were saying, 'Hello, I'm a Canadian from out here and I have some views to put on the table,'&quot; Reform's Grey told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;But as soon I say something like that or offer a view from the rest of Canada, we get slammed down and get called bigots and anti-Quebec. They are simply lies and it does nothing to further the debate.&quot;</p>
