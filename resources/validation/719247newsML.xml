<p>Misery is an H share investor. Joy holds a red chip portfolio. And little is likely to change for the two types of China-related shares on the Hong Kong stock market, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Red chips will still outperform, they are still the best in the region,&quot; said Lawrence Ang, head of China research at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Red chips are Hong Kong-based companies with mainland Chinese financial backing, while H shares are Chinese state enterprises or their units listed in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng China-affiliated Corporations Index of 32 red chip companies staged a strong rebound on Thursday, surging 115.11 points, or 3.75 percent, to 3,185.02.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of 32 H shares also rose, but a smaller 16.03 points, or 1.68 percent, to 967.62.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months, the red chip index has rocketted 212.02 percent, while the H share index has risen 22.1 percent</p>
<p>The red chip index was officially launched last month but was backdated to January 1993.</p>
<p>Even this respectable performance by H shares comes after their previous two-and-a-half year long slump.</p>
<p>Given that both of groups of companies do most of their business in China and draw their management teams from similar pools of Chinese officials and managers, why is there such a difference in the share price performance?</p>
<p>&quot;Because the investor is different,&quot; Ang explained.</p>
<p>Red chip investors are primarily retail investors, while institutions are the main buyers of H shares, Ang said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is very little retail investor interest in H shares,&quot; Ang said. &quot;H shares don't have the kind of excitement that red chips can provide.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said the H share market overall is still very much fundamentals driven, except for a few shares which are valued based on the red chip approach,</p>
<p>The red chip investment approach is to buy and sell stocks based on expectations of future corporate deals and injections of assets by Chinese parents, and not so much on management strength, quality of financial position, or industry position.</p>
<p>&quot;The market pays a premium for merger and acquisition activity,&quot; said Raymond Jook, associate director, China research at SocGen Crosby Securities.</p>
<p>Another big problem with H shares is the poor earnings outlook of the many of the companies, which tend to be involved in basic industries such as petrochemicals, steel and machinery.</p>
<p>&quot;Corporate earnings in 1997 first half are still not as good as people had expected,&quot; said Ang. &quot;In the past, investors had overestimated the earnings recovery of H shares and were burned. And the outlook is still not good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have revised downwards our earnings for 1997 from 16 percent, forecast at the start of the year, to five to six percent currently,&quot; said Ang.</p>
<p>Red chips, on the other hand, are experiencing rapid earnings growth derived from assets newly injected by their parents. Many are also involved in high-demand fields like property and infrastructure development, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;For our universe of red chips we are expecting 49 percent earnings growth in 1997 and 30 percent in 1998,&quot; said Jook.</p>
<p>Analysts said many red chips had risen too far too fast, especially in a frenzy of buying ahead of Hong Kong's return to China last week, and the sector index dropped nearly seven percent on Wednesday, shaking some of the euphoria out.</p>
<p>But the downturn was not likely to last long, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a meltdown,&quot; said Sonja Jong, research director at Fortis Investments (Asia) Ltd. &quot;If you hold the good ones, you have no need to worry.&quot;</p>
