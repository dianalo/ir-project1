<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-09-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch shares closed mixed on Thursday, retreating from a new trading high as profit-takers and short-term sceptics fed stock into the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Every time we got up to the old high there were people ready to sell,&quot; one dealer said, adding &quot;There's a fair bit of negative sentiment coming out of the options market as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers mainly agree the market's undertone is firm after last week's budget which pointed to faster economic growth in 1997. The AEX closed 0.76 points higher at 571.37, short of the 571.76 closing high scored on June 6. It earlier touched a trading high of 574.25, beating the 572.50 June 6 high.  </p>
<p>&quot;The fundamentals in the market are looking very good,&quot; said another dealer. &quot;I think the market will go further and further (upwards) because people are thinking over the budget and the forecasts for economic growth next year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;At this moment it's a little bit sideways and the options market is a bit on the sell side but we see the market getting up to a record soon, and 590 by the end of the year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Others said today's upward impetus looked to be on the back of short covering but remarked volumes were slender compared to Wednesday's flurry after the U.S. interest rate news, which came late on Tuesday, after the Dutch market had closed.  </p>
<p>Dealers said prices had been squeezed a little by stock shortages with some in the market reluctant to part with shares in case the market is set to break to new highs.</p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing lack of liquidity. Normally when you see new index highs the volume's much higher than it is today,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>Wall Street's lacklustre showing on Wednesday and its weaker opening on Thursday counterbalanced a strong dollar and firmer bonds. &quot;I get the feeling people were a bit disappointed that Wall Street didn't do a bit more after the news on Tuesday that the Fed wasn't moving interest rates,&quot; a dealer said.  </p>
<p>Chemicals and pharmaceuticals group Akzo closed 90 cents lower at 203.20 as profit-takers chipped away an earlier rise to 206.00 guilders on a general switching out of defensive stocks such as publishers into cyclicals.</p>
<p>Dealers said a recent trial of the company's Remeron antidepressant drug, which showed a superior performance to Eli Lilly's Prozac, had earlier boosted the shares. The shares have risen from 193.00 since Monday's news of the study.</p>
<p>Heineken gained 2.00 guilders to 318.00, recovering further from its recent mauling after a profit-warning and disappointing half year results which dragged the shares below 300 guilders.  </p>
<p>Chemicals firm DSM shed 2.40 guilders to 165.40 on profit-taking after a recent run on cyclicals buying. Royal Dutch was 20 cents lower at 264.40 guilders, although dealers said firmer oil prices should support the shares.</p>
<p>Other blue chips showed Philips down 0.80 guilders to 61.90 and Unilever up 2.70 to 272.20, while KLM climbed 1.20 guilders to 45.30 on fresh talk about a European alliance. -- Keiron Henderson, Amsterdam Newsroom +31 20 504 5000</p>
