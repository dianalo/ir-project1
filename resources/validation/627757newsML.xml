<p>British drug research company Chiroscience Group Plc on Friday announced a series of new and enhanced research projects resulting from its acquisition in December 1996 of Seattle-based Darwin Molecular.</p>
<p>In a statement ahead of a research and development update for analysts in London later Friday and in New York on Monday, Chiroscience said it planned to work on drugs for bone-wasting disease osteoporosis and psoriasis.</p>
<p>It also said its research for new cancer drugs would be enhanced by new tests for DNA, and that it was involved with the University of Washington in gene-based population screening of people susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis.  </p>
<p>Chiroscience said Darwin's skills in identifying genes responsible for different diseases would enhance the group's work.</p>
<p>In osteoporosis, which affects an estimated 22 million people in the U.S, Darwin is analysing genetic data obtained from monitoring a large group of people for the condition.</p>
<p>It is also mapping genes responsible for psoriasis, a skin condition which affects around 3.0 percent of people world-wide. It said a gene had recently been discovered which could lead to development of new treatments for the disorder.  </p>
<p>Darwin is also searching for genes which could lead to susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis. Chiroscience said Darwin was conducting genomic screening &quot;of a specific isolated population with a high prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis.&quot;</p>
<p>Related work is also being carried out on mouse genes.</p>
<p>In cancer, Chiroscience said Darwin was investigating genes linked to cancers including ovarian and prostate.</p>
