<p>A senior U.S. official urged Latin American countries on Monday to follow the United States and take a tough line against Cuba in a bid to force democratic reforms on the Communist-ruled island.</p>
<p>&quot;We are hopeful that Latin American countries will decide to condition improved relations with Cuba on fundamental change,&quot; said Jeffrey Davidow, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter American Affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe, too, that Latin American non-governmental groups are uniquely situated to encourage the development of independent civil society in Cuba,&quot; Davidow said in a speech on Cuba to the American Enterprise Institute, a policy think-tank.</p>
<p>Davidow said Latin American nations had an important role to play in forming a multilateral approach to Cuba. Many Latin Americans, however, had in the past seen the Cuba issue as a way to show their independence from the United States.</p>
<p>This view, he said, was gradually changing. &quot;There is a growing and profound appreciation throughout the hemisphere that the time has come for change in Cuba,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Davidow said President Bill Clinton's implementation of the Helms-Burton law had given the United States leverage in its policy on Cuba. The law, which was passed last year, toughened Washington's 35-year economic embargo against Cuba.</p>
<p>Davidow said European nations, many of which strongly opposed the Helms-Burton law, were now more outspoken in promoting democratic change in Cuba. &quot;Still not as much as any of us would like, but we've come a long way,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One section of the Helms-Burton law provides for senior executives of companies deemed to be &quot;trafficking&quot; in property seized from U.S. nationals in Cuba to be barred from the United States.</p>
<p>Last week, the United States excused Italian telecommunications company STET International from penalties under the Helms-Burton law after the firm struck a deal with America's ITT Corp. over telephone holdings in Cuba.</p>
<p>Davidow said this settlement was a major step forward in the enforcement of the legislation and served as a disincentive to investment in Cuba.</p>
<p>&quot;The (State) department has a number of companies under investigation for possible trafficking and will continue to pursue all evidence and leads,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Davidow said the political and economic situation was deteriorating quickly in Cuba. The economy was in dire straits, the sugar harvest would be lower than expected and tourism was not growing at the rate Cuba hoped for.</p>
<p>Cuba also has clamped down on opponents, arresting a group of dissidents this month.</p>
<p>&quot;We call on the Cuban government to release the dissidents and to take the steps necessary to guarantee the exercise of fundamental freedoms,&quot; he said.</p>
