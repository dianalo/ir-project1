<p>Philippine President Fidel Ramos on Wednesday hailed a Moslem rebel chief's election as governor of a semi-autonomous region and said he hoped the guerrilla leader would fight as tenaciously for peace as he did for war.</p>
<p>Nur Misuari, chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), ran unopposed in Monday's elections and unofficial results showed him garnering 485,112 votes out of 507,074 votes counted so far with about 200,000 more still to be tabulated.</p>
<p>Election officials have yet to formally proclaim Misuari as the victor.</p>
<p>&quot;By joining the mainstream of democratic government, the MNLF enriches our political tradition with a legacy of revolutionary ideals turned into reformist zeal and determination,&quot; Ramos said in a statement.</p>
<p>He said he believed the MNLF leadership in the semi-autonomous area comprising four Moslem provinces in the southern Philippines would be &quot;committed to fight as tenaciously for peace as it has waged war&quot;.</p>
<p>Misuari's election as regional governor is part of a peace deal he signed with Manila last week formally ending a 24-year separatist war that killed more than 120,000 people.</p>
<p>The deal calls for the establishment of an MNLF-led council to supervise development in 14 southern provinces, most of which are dominated by Christians.</p>
<p>The council will serve as forerunner of a wider autonomous region to be composed of provinces that would vote to join it in a plebiscite three years from now.</p>
