<title>USA: CBOT corn ends quiet session mixed, nearbys flat.</title>
<headline>CBOT corn ends quiet session mixed, nearbys flat.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-12-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Corn futures on the CBOT ended mixed, but many contracts closed unchanged after a session of lackluster trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Quiet trade is typical for this time of year,&quot; a floor trader said.</p>
<p>Because the CBOT will be closed for the New Year's holiday on Wednesday, interest in the market was stifled and volume was low, floor traders said.</p>
<p>Traders noted an abundance of commercial buying under the market, which helped to keep nearby corn prices firm, floor sources said.</p>
<p>Cargill was a prominent buyer of March corn again Tuesday, purchasing two million bushels. Many in the trade believe Cargill's recent heavy corn purchases are tied to its pending request to sell grain to North Korea.</p>
<p>Others said that Cargill was just covering short positions.</p>
<p>Talk that yields in Argentina will be record-breaking because of good growing conditions so far continued to weigh on the market, traders said. Most estimates on the Argentine crop are now near 15 million tonnes, traders said.</p>
<p>CBOT corn closed down 1/4 to 1/4 higher, with March steady at $2.58-1/4 and May down 1/4 at $2.60-1/2.  </p>
<p>On the day, FIMAT Futures bought one million bushels March and Term Commodities bought one million May, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 30,000 contracts, below the 61,513 contracts traded Monday.</p>
