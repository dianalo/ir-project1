<p>Stockpiled Russian strategic metals may already have moved into the minor metals market, or are in the process of doing so, several European traders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Recently traders said they believed that 420 tonnes of cobalt, 30,000 76 lb flasks of mercury, 7,000 tonnes of titanium sponge and an undisclosed amount of chrome could be released from strategic stockpiles.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday trade sources said that a large proportion of the cobalt had already sold to a major trade organisation.</p>
<p>&quot;The cobalt has been sold into the market over the last few weeks but has been reasonably absorbed,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be becoming a hard fact that the Russian government has given the go ahead for the release of the material&quot; one London based trader said.</p>
<p>But as usual in such matters the Russian authorities would not comment on the talk that has been circulating the market recently.</p>
<p>The metals in question have remained relatively stable but have started to show signs of cracking under downside pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;Chrome and mercury have the potential to fall, while cobalt has eased but this is not entirely due to the talk of the sale,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Despite the troubles in war-torn Zaire, cobalt has eased throughout most of the early part of 1997 as traders eyed supply and demand figures.</p>
<p>&quot;Cobalt is on a downward trail but has the potential to bounce strongly if fresh buying emerges,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Others agreed saying that despite the rumoured Russian material the market remained fairly tight.</p>
<p>Cobalt is often pressured lower by traders around the time of U.S.DLA sales. On Feb 20 the DLA started negotiations for its latest offering.</p>
<p>&quot;Cobalt prices eased back ignoring the troubles in Zaire with demand reportedly healthy. Rumours in the market suggest that short sellers have been seeking to drive prices down ahead of a DLA sale in the US,&quot; Flemings Global Mining Group said in their Metal Monitor.</p>
<p>Russian cobalt was trading was trading in a range of between $18 and $19 a lb according to some traders.</p>
<p>Others said their range was lower at roughly between $17 and $18. In mid-January prices commanded levels of around $20.</p>
<p>Despite the drift most of the traders polled by Reuters believed prices had the potential to snap higher.</p>
<p>&quot;It may have to drift towards $15/$16 before a recovery emerges...consumers are likely to cover at these lower levels&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>High grade material was around $20/$21, against $22/$23 in late January.</p>
<p>A specialist in  the chrome market said prices which have seen solid gains in 1997 could fall if Russian stockpiled material is released in the summer months.</p>
<p>Adding to the downside pressure in this market was China, a major producer of chrome.</p>
<p>Chrome A/T lo-nitro was close to $6,800 a tonne, while hi-nitro stood at near $6,200 a tonne, both firmer from earlier levels in 1997.Currently two facilities in China are running near the higher end of capacity, while a third is expected to restart production in March after a period of running almost idle, traders said.</p>
<p>Mercury has stalled and is looking over-cooked at current levels, while titanium sponge maintains higher levels against a backdrop of brisk demand from the US and a shortage of readily available material.</p>
<p>Mercury hovered near $150 for a flask of 76 Ibs down on a recent peak of towards $170.</p>
<p>Titanium sponge held steady levels at $7.50/8.00 a kilo.</p>
