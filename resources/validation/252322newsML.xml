<title>USA: MGE spring wheat follows other markets to end up.</title>

<p>MGE spring wheat futures were mostly a follower of other wheat markets throughout the day, but a late surge enabled spring wheat to close relatively higher than their CBOT and KCBT counterparts, traders said.</p>
<p>U.S. wheat gained on hopes of exports, triggered not only by a stronger-than-expected weekly export sales report but also by the news that India will need to import two million tonnes of wheat.</p>
<p>But gains in MGE spring wheat were limited during the first half of the session by hedge-selling related to an increase in country movement.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a late buying surge helped March spring wheat break through Wednesday's resistance at $3.85-1/2 per bushel.</p>
<p>Benson-Quinn, CIS, Atwood/Peavey and Country Hedging each sold around 800,000 March bushels, and traders said most of this was hedge-related.</p>
<p>Wilson reportedly bought two million March bushels on the intermarket spread with Kansas City. CIS bought 1.6 million March -- much of it in the session's second half.</p>
<p>MGE spring wheat closed 2-1/2 to eight cents per bushel higher, with Dec up 2-1/2 cents at $4.19. March gained 6-1/2 cents to settle at $3.87-1/4.</p>
<p>MGE barley futures did not trade.</p>
