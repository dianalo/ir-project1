<title>USA: Virginia to execute Ronald Hoke.</title>
<headline>Virginia to execute Ronald Hoke.</headline>
<dateline>JARRATT, Va. 1996-12-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Ronald Lee Hoke Jr., convicted of raping, robbing and stabbing a woman to death on the same day he was released from a state mental institution, was due to be executed on Monday by lethal injection.</p>
<p>Hoke, 39, would be the eighth person executed in Virginia this year, the most in any U.S. state in 1996.</p>
<p>Prison authorities said  Hoke ordered fried chicken, french fries, corn, a tossed salad, biscuits, apple pie with vanilla ice cream and iced tea for a last meal.</p>
<p>He spent Sunday receiving visits from friends, the clergy and lawyers.</p>
<p>Hoke was sentenced to death for the Oct. 4, 1985, slaying of Virginia Stell, 56, a Petersburg, Va., woman he met a few hours after he was discharged from the Central State Hospital, also in Petersburg.</p>
<p>The hospital had given him a bus ticket back to his home in Hagerstown, Md., and a ride to the bus station. However, he cashed in the bus ticket and used it to buy drinks in a bar where he met Stell.</p>
<p>The two went to her apartment where he admits he tied her up and stabbed her to death. But he said the robbery was an afterthought, and that the two had had consensual sex.</p>
<p>Hoke turned himself in to police, who had no suspects, several days after the murder.</p>
<p>Hoke's lawyer Gerald Zerkin, of Richmond, argued that Hoke was improperly convicted of capital murder. He alleged that the prosecution hid evidence of Stell's prior sexual conduct, which buttressed Hoke's contention their sex was consensual.</p>
<p>Virginia ranks third in the country for the most executions -- 36 since resumption of the death penalty in the mid 1970s. Texas leads the country overall with 107, followed by Florida with 38.</p>
