<title>USA: DALLAS AIRPORT BOARD OKS CAR-RENT FACILITY BUDGET.</title>
<headline>DALLAS AIRPORT BOARD OKS CAR-RENT FACILITY BUDGET.</headline>
<dateline>GRAPEVINE, Texas 1997-08-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport board on Thursday approved a $5.35 million budget for design and engineering work for a consolidated car rental facility that will allow nine agencies to operate on airport grounds.</p>
<p>The new budget represents an additional $800,000 for the project, which had previously been authorized by the board to ease traffic congestion from shuttle buses and rental cars using the airport's access road.  </p>
<p>The board also approved $5 million for design and construction management services for a proposed $51.7 million project that includes runway extensions and construction of a holding apron.</p>
<p>Airport officials say the consolidated car rental facility, to be financed from the $140 million revenue bonds already issued, is needed for public convenience. Currently, only four agencies operate at the airport and the others, located outside its perimeter, use shuttle services.  </p>
<p>&quot;Since the (new) facility will serve as the single pick-up (and) drop-off location for all rent-a-car companies serving the airport, more than 2.5 million annual (car rental) transactions will be eliminated from the toll plazas, significantly reducing the volume of traffic,&quot; the board said.</p>
<p>The runway expansion would add 2,000 feet to the north-south runways, bringing them to about 13,000 feet.</p>
<p>The runway expansion is part of another project that also calls for adding nine new gates at terminal 2W for American Airlines, the airport's largest carrier. Total cost of that project, estimated at about $144 million, is to be financed from the $3 passenger facilities fee and other user fees. When completed, the airport will have a total of 125 gates.</p>
