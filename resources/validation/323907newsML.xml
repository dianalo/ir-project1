<p>Defence lawyers for three of the four men on trial for rigging soccer matches on Wednesday savaged the main witness, saying he had fabricated his evidence and just wanted to make money from the case.</p>
<p>The prosecution's case depends largely on the evidence of Chris Vincent, who said former Liverpool goalkeeper and business partner Bruce Grobbelaar told him he had rigged games for an Asian betting syndicate in 1993 and 1994.</p>
<p>But Grobbelaar's lawyer Rodney Klevan said Vincent was a lying, vindictive no-hoper who wanted to bring down the keeper after he pulled out of a safari company the two men were running in Zimbabwe in July 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;You're lying about this and lying about anything you say about Grobbelaar and match-fixing,&quot; he snapped at one point. Vincent admits wanting to crush Grobbelaar while making as much money as he can from the case.</p>
<p>He covertly recorded conversations with Grobbelaar in which the player appeared to admit he had fixed matches. The tapes were made with the help of the Sun, a tabloid newspaper which broke the story in November 1994.</p>
<p>The prosecution says Grobbelaar tried to fix at least four matches and was paid by Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim and former striker John Fashanu, both accused of being middlemen for the Far Eastern betting syndicate.</p>
<p>Former Wimbledon goalkeeper Hans Segers is accused with Lim and Fashanu of taking part in a separate bid to fix matches. All four have pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Vincent said he had accompanied Grobbelaar on a trip to London in late November 1993 to pick up 40,000 pounds ($66,000) from Fashanu as a reward from the syndicate for throwing a match against Newcastle.</p>
<p>Fashanu's lawyer Trevor Burke denied the charge, saying that as the case progressed, Vincent seemed to add more and more details to his acccount which he had not mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people's memories fade over time, but yours seems to improve,&quot; Burke told the witness in mock amazement.</p>
<p>Burke said there were glaring discrepancies between two statements Vincent had sworn before lawyers, his statement to police, the transcript of a book he has co-written, his evidence in court and the Sun articles.</p>
<p>Vincent agreed there were discrepancies -- which he said were caused by various omissions and errors -- but on several occasions replied &quot;I can't recall,&quot; &quot;I don't know&quot; or &quot;I didn't think it was relevant&quot; when asked to explain further.</p>
<p>Burke said the Sun had destroyed all the notes and recordings it made of its conversations with Vincent, who said he was now in dispute with the newspaper over what he said was its failure to stick to an agreement to pay him money.</p>
