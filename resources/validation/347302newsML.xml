<p>The judge in the O.J. Simpson civil trial dismissed the only black member of the jury on Friday and ordered the panellists to begin their deliberations from scratch.</p>
<p>A source involved in the trial said the dismissal of the elderly woman after three days of deliberations had nothing to do with the current investigation into allegations of jury tampering that have swirled around the case this week.</p>
<p>The woman was dismissed for failing to disclose that her daughter was a legal secretary in the office of Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti, who unsuccessfully prosecuted Simpson on criminal murder charges, the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;She did say that her daughter was a legal secretary but didn't say who she worked for,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>She was replaced by an alternate juror, an Asian-American man in his 30s, a computer programmer who said during jury selection he was &quot;neutral&quot; but believed evidence planting was possible. The defence in the case has claimed evidence in the case was planted and contaminated and could not be trusted.</p>
<p>The jury is now made up of six men and six women, among them nine whites, one Hispanic, one Asian-American and one person of mixed black and Asian descent. The panel that acquitted Simpson in his criminal trial was mostly black.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Garcetti said Fujisaki was informed by the District Attorney's Office on Thursday that the dismissed juror's daughter worked in the office.</p>
<p>&quot;We only learned yesterday afternoon that she was a sitting juror,&quot; the spokeswoman said. &quot;We immediately communicated this information to the court.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, investigators continued to probe the jury tampering allegations, sparked earlier in the week by two jurors -- one of whom was the dismissed black panellist -- who informed Fujisaki that they had received a letter signed by two of the jurors in Simpson's criminal case.</p>
<p>The ex-football star was acquitted of the June 12, 1994, murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman by the criminal court jury in October 1995.</p>
<p>He now was battling a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the families of the victims, who are seeking substantial damages.</p>
<p>The source said the dismissed juror was booted from the panel at the request of the defence over strong objections by plaintiffs' attorneys. Fujisaki also denied a plaintiffs' request to have the newly reconstituted jury sequestered during its deliberations.</p>
<p>The judge also turned down a demand by Robert Baker, Simpson's lead attorney, that a mistrial be declared.</p>
<p>In a hastily called court hearing to announce the juror's dismissal, Fujisaki said, &quot;A juror has been excused for legal cause and replaced with an alternate juror ... The law grants each party in this case the right to a verdict reached only after full participation of all jurors who ultimately return the verdict.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This right may be assured in this case only if the jury begins its deliberations again from the beginning,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The judge went on to tell the jurors they must &quot;disregard and put out of your mind all past deliberations and begin deliberating anew.&quot; Jurors began their deliberations on Tuesday after three months of testimony.</p>
<p>In the jury tampering probe, deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department on Thursday night searched the home of Brenda Moran, one of the criminal court jurors who signed the letter, and carted away a computer, note pads and other documents.</p>
<p>Moran, who is writing a book on her experiences in the criminal trial, told reporters the letter was not supposed to have been mailed until the civil case was over.</p>
<p>&quot;I wrote some of it, not all of it,&quot; she said. &quot;The (agent) was supposed to give the (civil case) jurors this letter way after all of this was over with.&quot;</p>
<p>The letter, which was also signed by criminal case juror Gina Rosborough, urged the civil trial jurors to get in touch with their agent.</p>
