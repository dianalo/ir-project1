<p>CSCE world sugar futures settled firmer, with the most-active March contract piercing resistance at 10.83 cents and closing just under the day's high.</p>
<p>Dealers said aggressive trade selling capped the rally despite steady fund buying throughout the day. Trade selling in the March/May spread was also noted.</p>
<p>Traders had expected a flurry of new buying to emerge as March climbed over 10.83 cents, the high made Tuesday. While today's gains were limited, the strong close could signal higher prices Thursday, traders said .</p>
<p>Firm resistance was pegged at 11.00 cents in March.</p>
<p>With an ongoing lack of physical business, however, several market sources said prices are doomed to fall to the downside target of 10.00.</p>
<p>Nearby support was pegged at 10.75 cents.</p>
<p>In volume estimated at a brisk 25,635 lots, the March contract closed up 0.09 to 10.86, traded 10.87 to 10.69. The back months finished 0.08 higher to 0.07 lower.</p>
