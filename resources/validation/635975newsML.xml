<p>Internazionale Milan president Massimo Moratti expects Barcelona's unsettled Brazil striker Ronaldo to sign for the Italian club in the next few days.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope to give the announcement by the end of the week,&quot; Moratti told reporters on Wednesday. &quot;Let us hope so for Italian soccer and for Inter.</p>
<p>&quot;Now there will be further meetings to better define some aspects, but I think all will go well,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Ronaldo, currently playing for his country in the Tournoi de France, confirmed on Wednesday he was all but finished with Barcelona and would probably join an Italian club next season.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision is the same that I took last week, I have no reason to change it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll probably play in Italy,&quot; Ronaldo added at Brazil's Tounoi training camp near Lyon.</p>
<p>&quot;For the moment I am a Barcelona player, but I already have the letter with the money to pay the clause,&quot; he said after a 50-minute meeting with his Brazilian agents Alexandre Martins and Reinaldo Pitta.</p>
<p>Ronaldo can buy his freedom of movement from Barcelona for some $32 million according to a clause in his contract.</p>
<p>Barcelona announced last week that the 20-year-old striker had signed for another nine years at the Spanish club for $3.5 million a season. But problems with the payment of a $14 million one-off bonus scuppered the contract talks.</p>
