<headline>Jury finds former U.S. fugitive guilty of rape.</headline>
<dateline>STAMFORD, Conn. 1997-06-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>A jury on Thursday found former fugitive Alex Kelly guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl after a party 11 years ago, an official in the Stamford Superior Court's clerk's office said.</p>
<p>The six-member jury reached its verdict just a day after beginning deliberations in a retrial that began on May 15. Kelly's first trial ended in a hung jury last November.</p>
<p>Kelly, 30, fled the United States in 1987 on the eve of his original scheduled trial and lived as a fugitive for eight years before surrendering in Switzerland in 1995.</p>
<p>He faced a single count of sexual assault, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail. He had claimed that the sex was consensual.</p>
<p>There was no immediate information on sentencing.</p>
<p>Kelly was also accused of raping a 17-year-old girl in February 1986 in a separate incident, but the two cases are being tried separately. No date has been set for the second trial.</p>
