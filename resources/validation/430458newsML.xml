<p>Concerns that scarce U.S. soybean supplies will not last through the summer sent soybean futures soaring the daily limit at the Chicago Board of Trade on Monday, oilseed analysts and traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We do have extremely tight stocks and we still have a need to ration demand,&quot; said Mark Weidner, oilseeds analyst with Cargill Investor Services. &quot;As of yet, given the crush and export pace, it's evident we have not done that yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The rally came one day before the U.S. Agriculture Department releases estimates for U.S. soybean supplies.  </p>
<p>Analysts and traders said they expected USDA to trim its projections for 1996/97 ending stocks by 10 million to 15 million bushels. That would leave 125 million to 130 million bushels, or two weeks' supply, at the end of August.</p>
<p>Active export demand, shipping delays in Brazil and continued strong domestic usage have consumed more soybeans than USDA initially expected, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The report, if it comes out as expected, will add more fuel to the fire,&quot; said Vic Lespinasse, trader with Dean Witter. &quot;The market has a job to do. It has to ration (demand) and it's trying to do just that.&quot;  </p>
<p>The spot March contract rose to a peak of $8.62 a bushel Monday, the highest level for a nearby contract since September 1988. It closed 30-1/4 cents higher at $8.57-3/4.</p>
<p>But the gains are just beginning to force processors, the largest domestic users, out of the market.</p>
<p>A U.S. Census report issued last month showed processors crushed a record number of soybeans in December and January. The weekly crush pace has remained at a hefty 30 million bushels the last few months, eating into U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>Exports have also hovered around the 30 million bushel mark each week and have shown little sign of tapering off.  </p>
<p>Despite high prices, buyers have been forced to stick to U.S. supplies because they have few alternatives.</p>
<p>Brazil is expected to harvest a record 26.88 million tonne crop, according to Brazilian consultants Safras e Mercado. But recent dockworkers' strikes at two key Brazilian ports have slowed the pace of exports, and persistent rains have impeded the loading of soybeans and soymeal into waiting vessels.</p>
<p>Even with record crops out of South America, U.S. supplies may not last through September if demand continues at the current pace, said Dave Armstrong, analyst at ABN-AMRO Chicago Corp.  </p>
<p>&quot;It almost doesn't matter what their crop size is (in South America),&quot; Armstrong said. &quot;I don't think we can physically have that small a carryout and survive September.&quot;</p>
<p>Action in the soybean pit has attracted more and more traders to the market. Open interest climbed to more than 965 million bushels at Friday's close, compared with roughly 844 million on February 10, CBOT reported.</p>
<p>Open interest in the most-active May contract more than doubled in that period to 440 million bushels on Friday from 203 million in February.</p>
<p>May soybean futures have surged $1.21-1/2 per bushel in the last month. The May contract closed Monday at $8.60 per bushel, compared with $7.38-1/2 per bushel on February 10.</p>
<p>&quot;This just shows the explosive nature of this market,&quot; Armstrong added. &quot;Demand is not being checked by moderately high prices, so people are wondering what kind of prices it takes to stop it.&quot;</p>
