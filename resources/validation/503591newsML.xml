<headline>West finally dumps Mobutu after 30 years.</headline>

<p>By Nicholas Doughty, Diplomatic Correspondent</p>
<p>Western countries are finally pulling the plug on Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, ending 30 years of support for the tough ruler whom they once saw as the key to stability in Africa's third largest state.</p>
<p>But, with no desire to intervene in the increasingly chaotic country, the United States and its European allies are far less clear about what might follow Mobutu if he quits.</p>
<p>The United States said this week it was time for him to go. France, the major European power in Africa, has dropped its belief that Mobutu could survive and called for an &quot;orderly transition&quot; of power. Belgium, the former colonial power, said Zaire was now in the hands of a military dictatorship.</p>
<p>As so often in international diplomacy, such candour is the result of a &quot;fait accompli&quot; now confronting the West.</p>
<p>Mobutu, following a successful policy of divide and rule, had managed to keep an iron grip on power since taking power in 1965 -- until the latest rebellion flared last October. His army is beaten and ragged, any popular support gone.</p>
<p>Once a valued ally who could help fight off the communist threat in Africa during the Cold War, Mobutu has become a liability to the West, an old man stricken by cancer in a country where major powers no longer have &quot;strategic interests&quot;.</p>
<p>For years, human rights groups and many Zaireans have accused Mobutu of establishing a corrupt dictatorship and of enriching himself at the expense of his impoverished people.</p>
<p>Western capitals felt unable to be so blunt as long as they needed him, although a French government minister memorably stepped out of line in 1991 and called Mobutu &quot;a walking bank account in a leopard-skin cap&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, though, the gloves are off. Washington has urged an end to &quot;dictatorship&quot; in Zaire. On Thursday, Belgium condemned Mobutu's appointment of a general as prime minister, saying it was a &quot;military dictatorship revisited&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that President Mobutu, with his coup d'etat, has returned to the point he started out at more than 30 years ago,&quot; said Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke.</p>
<p>It remains unclear whether Mobutu, 66, is ready to stand down, or where he would go if he were to do so.</p>
<p>But there is caution in Western capitals about rebel leader Laurent Kabila, a former Marxist whose forces control half the country including its mineral-rich economic heartland.</p>
<p>Western diplomats say there are fears that the vast central African state could break up, spreading instability and more refugees to its neighbours as it becomes, like Somalia, another &quot;collapsed state&quot; on the world's poorest continent.</p>
<p>French Prime Minister Alain Juppe, in an interview to be published on Saturday in the weekly Le Figaro-Magazine, cast doubt on the rebels' intentions to call elections.</p>
<p>&quot;Who seriously thinks that the choice is between a tired dictator, Mr Mobutu, and a young, dynamic and modern democrat, Mr Kabila?&quot; Juppe asked.</p>
<p>&quot;When you hear (Kabila) say there won't be an election, that the people must first 'become sensitive to the doctrine', you can only worry about what it means.&quot;</p>
<p>Belgium's Derycke echoed the French caution.</p>
<p>&quot;Kabila makes declarations -- we have to see if he does what he says he will,&quot; he said.</p>
