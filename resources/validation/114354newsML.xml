<p>While reacting with dismay to Republican attacks on President Bill Clinton's character, the president's aides privately believe the strategy will backfire and doom any chance for rival Bob Dole to revive his campaign.</p>
<p>Clinton, in New Mexico to prepare for his final debate with Dole on Wednesday night in San Diego, has adopted an above-the-fray attitude as vice presidental challenger Jack Kemp and House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich lead increasingly aggressive assaults on Clinton's ethics and character.</p>
<p>&quot;Sen. Dole will decide his strategy and I will decide mine, and we'll see what the people have to say afterwards,&quot; Clinton said on Monday during a brief exchange with reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important thing, I hope, is that it (the debate) will be something that people will feel better about when it's over,&quot; Clinton said, adding that his first debate with Dole had been &quot;fundamentally positive.&quot;</p>
<p>Gingrich emerged from self-imposed exile over the weekend after Dole and his advisers huddled in Washington to discuss how to generate public doubts about Clinton's moral leadership.</p>
<p>The Republican firebrand predicted &quot;unavoidable&quot; congressional and criminal investigations into contacts between Clinton and an Indonesian businessman and his associates, including an Indonesian couple's $425,000 contribution to the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>&quot;This makes Watergate look tiny. I mean, this is a potential abuse of the American system on behalf of an Indonesian billionaire in a way that we have never seen in American history,&quot; Gingrich said on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation&quot;.</p>
<p>He also linked reports of alleged past drug use by some members of the White House staff to what he said were administration cutbacks in the anti-drug war.</p>
<p>&quot;It's great to have Newt back and its stupid for them to let him do it,&quot; a senior Clinton campaign official said of Gingrich, who for much of the year had adopted a low profile because of negative assessments of him among voters.</p>
<p>Clinton campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart said that &quot;the only thing better than having Newt Gingrich as Bob Dole's chief spokesman is to have Newt Gingrich speaking on ethics for Bob Dole. He's not credible.&quot;</p>
<p>Gingrich has been the subject of several investigations involving alleged conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Kemp, who disappointed some party activists last week when he avoided personal attacks on Clinton during his vice presidential debate with Al Gore, also has stepped up his rhetoric challenging Clinton on the character issue.</p>
<p>There has been considerable speculation about just how aggressive Dole will be in the second presidential debate with Clinton, in which members of an audience made up of undecided voters will ask the candidates questions.</p>
<p>Some Dole advisers, including former Education Secretary William Bennett, have argued that only a broad assault on Clinton's character will pump momentum into the Dole campaign.</p>
<p>But Dole has seemed reluctant to revive the reputation he acquired 20 years ago as a &quot;hatchet man&quot; while running for vice president on the 1976 Republican ticket with then-President Gerald Ford.</p>
<p>Clinton's aides contend that Dole would only hurt himself by doing so.</p>
<p>&quot;From our standpoint, if they go negative it will only hurt them. If Dole himself goes negative it (the election) is all over,&quot; said a campaign official. &quot;The American people want us to discuss the issues, not this other stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the pressure to attack Clinton's character, a new Time/CNN survey found that nearly half of registered voters believe that Dole already has been too negative. The poll found that 49 percent felt that Dole had engaged in too much negative campaigning, compared to just 22 percent who thought Clinton had attacked his opponent too often.</p>
