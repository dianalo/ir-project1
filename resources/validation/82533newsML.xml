<p>Heating and building materials group Hepworth Plc on Friday predicted &quot;steady progress&quot; on the back of improved growth prospects across Europe, which it said should stimulate new construction and home improvement spending.</p>
<p>The company reported a slight fall in first-half pre-tax profit to 35.5 million stg from 37.5 million a year earlier in what it described as &quot;challenging conditions&quot;.</p>
<p>Chief executive John Carter said in a statement that the group was continuing to develop its internationals potential, with good progress being made on the two Chinese and one Spanish manufaturing operations commissioned over the past year.  </p>
<p>&quot;Hepworth's strong financial position will be applied to the development of key product growth and appropriate acquisitions,&quot; Carter said, adding that &quot;vigorous action will be taken to ensure competitiveness.&quot;</p>
<p>The group said its pretax profits were affected by redundancy charges of 2.4 million stg, compared with 1.1 million a year before, and higher pension charges, partly offset by property disposals. The group's gearing declined to 15.6 percent at the end of the first half from 22.3 percent a year before.</p>
<p>The group said Pierre Franken is to replace Jean-Francois Chene as head of Hepworth Saunier Duval on December 1.  </p>
<p>Exports from all UK divisions continued to rise, gaining 24 percent in the first six months of 1996.</p>
<p>Operating profits and sales fell at Hepworth building products, affected by weak UK housing starts, a &quot;marked fall&quot; in new road building and cold weather in continental Europe.</p>
<p>Sales and operating profits rose at Hepworth Home Products.</p>
<p>Sales at the French heating unit Saunier Duval were helped by exchange rate benefits and new products,although operating profits fell slightly due to higher redundancy costs.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a good performance when considered against the generally subdued market for gas boilers,&quot; Hepworth said.</p>
