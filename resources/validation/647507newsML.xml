<p>Stocks broke records for a second straight session on Monday, but bonds fell as investors took profits after last week's gains.</p>
<p>The dollar fell sharply for the second consecutive session as concerns mounted over Japan's growing trade surplus and Europe's plan to launch a single currency.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended 42.72 points higher at 7,478.50, the second straight record finish for the blue chip index. Including the day's gains, the Dow has surged more than 1,000 points since the start of 1997.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancers outpaced decliners 1,414 to 1,087 on volume of 465.6 million on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Though the session lacked the sheer firepower displayed Friday -- when the Dow jumped 130.49 points -- it brought the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks and the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq composites to all-time highs.</p>
<p>Leading the rally among blue chips were technology and drug stocks, as investors focused on the potential export benefits of a weaker U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Over the last five weeks, the dollar has fallen sharply against the Japanese yen and has recently begun struggling against the German mark, which has firmed on mounting uncertainty over issues related to European Monetary Union.</p>
<p>&quot;For the most part, the groups going up today you could cover with the umbrella of exports,&quot; said Greg Nie, technical analyst at Everen Securities. &quot;Techs and drug companies are both beneficiaries of a declining dollar.&quot;</p>
<p>Comcast Corp. jumped 2-13/16 to 21-1/16 after Microsoft Corp. agreed to make a $1 billion investment in the company, a move that significantly broadens the software giant's reach in the broadcast business.</p>
<p>Cablevision Systems Corp. soared 9-1/2 to 44-1/8 after it said it would buy 10 cable systems in the New York area from Tele-Communications Inc. for stock worth more than $500 million, after factoring in the day's gains.</p>
<p>The developments sparked life into the cable sector, which had languished for an extended period, analysts said.</p>
<p>Financial stocks ended lower. The group was an indirect casualty of the declining dollar, which contributed to a weak performance in the bond market. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 18/32, or $5.63 on a $1,000 bond, pushing the yield up to 6.82 percent from 6.80 percent at Friday's close. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>The dollar fell as low as 1.7020 German marks in early U.S. trading, 4 pfennigs below the 39-month high reached Friday in European trade, and dropped to a six-month low of 111.80 Japanese yen in Asian trade as nerves frayed ahead of Wednesday's scheduled release of fresh Japanese trade figures.</p>
<p>The dollar fetched 1.7065 marks and 112.90 yen late Monday, down from 1.7247 marks and 114.37 yen late Friday.</p>
<p>Coffee prices closed sharply higher as weather forecasts calling for another chilly night in top producers Brazil triggered a wave of buying by speculators.</p>
<p>At the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, coffee for July delivery surged 16.05 cents a pound -- or nearly seven percent -- to close at 253.30 cents. That compares to the 20-year high of 318 cents a pound set late last month.</p>
<p>In the grain markets, weather forecasts showing temperatures in the Midwest climbing back to normal levels helped prompt a sharp fall in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of Trade. A large buildup of &quot;short&quot; or selling positions by commercial grain firms also added pressure.</p>
<p>Soybeans for July delivery closed down 24-1/2 cents a bushel at $8.11, with many speculators exiting the market.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's benchmark FTSE 100 share index closed 41.7 points higher at 4,686.7, just 7.6 points off its May 16 record close. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 ended 261.93 points, or 1.28 percent, lower at 20,223.82.</p>
