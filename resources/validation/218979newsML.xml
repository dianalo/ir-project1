<p>A North Korean sailor rescued while drifting off a South Korean island returned home through the border village of Panmunjom on Tuesday, military officials said.</p>
<p>The sailor, Chung Kwang-son, private first class in North Korea's navy, crossed the border and was met by North Korean officers, they said.  </p>
<p>The return of Chung was the first goodwill gesture by Seoul towards Pyongyang since already tense relations between the two Koreas worsened after a Northern submarine landed 26 agents on a South Korean beach in September.</p>
<p>Of the 26, 24 have been killed, one has been captured alive and another is still at large.</p>
<p>Chung, 19, was picked up by a South Korean maritime police vessel and taken to the western port city of Inchon on Saturday after his boat drifted into Southern waters.</p>
<p>He was first spotted on Friday about 21 miles (34 km) southwest of South Korea's So Yonpyongdo island, which is close to the border with the communist North, Seoul officials said.</p>
