<p>If Cuban President Fidel Castro's grip on power is slipping, is U.S. policy towards the communist-ruled island helping or hindering a transition?</p>
<p>Experts and academics agreed at a weekend symposium on Cuba, organised by the University of Miami's Cuban Studies Association, that Castro's revolution was struggling for survival in a changed world</p>
<p>But they disagreed on how much a U.S. trade embargo, and particularly the controversial Helms-Burton Act, were contributing to peaceful change.</p>
<p>Jorge Dominguez, director of Harvard University's Centre for International Affairs, said important changes were taking place in Cuba due to economic reforms forced on the government since the demise of its main sponsor, the Soviet Union, in 1989.</p>
<p>Otto Reich, chairman of the U.S.-Cuba Business Council in Miami, home to a vociferous exile community, said economic recovery was impossible until Castro went.</p>
<p>Dominguez said Castro was unable to wield power as before and there was an &quot;extraordinary&quot; loss of control over the daily lives of people.</p>
<p>&quot;Money has assumed a new role. Castro has been compelled to make changes. He has been obligated to do what he does not want to,&quot; he said, adding. &quot;It's not a religious conversion.&quot;</p>
<p>Economic reforms had raised peoples' expectations and the commitment to ideology had lessened, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The future is at best uncertain, at worst doomed. They (the leadership) know now the future is not on their side.&quot;</p>
<p>Dominguez said, however, he saw the Helms-Burton Act as counterproductive and unnecessary.</p>
<p>The act was introduced in March and allows U.S. citizens to take legal action against companies investing in property confiscated after the 1959 revolution.</p>
<p>It has infuriated Canada, Mexico, and European countries whose investment in Cuba has helped bolster the economy.</p>
<p>Dominguez said the law served Castro by offering the United States as a scapegoat. Although he believed the U.S. trade embargo should be kept on as a form of pressure, some aspects of it should be lifted, such as bans on food, medicines and communications equipment like fax machines.</p>
<p>Reich dismissed the theory that current foreign investment was helping Cuba, calling it artificial.</p>
<p>&quot;It is there to capture tourist dollars, to export goods. It is not for the domestic consumption,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't believe that foreign investment can work where there is no domestic private sector.</p>
<p>A normalisation of relations with the United States was a prerequisite of any economic recovery, he added.</p>
<p>The Helms-Burton legislation had definitely had an impact, Reich said. Some foreign firms had pulled out, others decided against investing and some were trying to renegotiate contracts.</p>
<p>Lawyer Saturnino Lucio said he supported the act but doubted if it would make Cuba a democracy.</p>
<p>It was designed to create problems for foreign investors but few lawsuits were likely to be successful given the problems of amassing documentation and the costs of litigation, he said.</p>
<p>Lucio said he would not be surprised if it disappeared should President Bill Clinton win reelection in November.</p>
