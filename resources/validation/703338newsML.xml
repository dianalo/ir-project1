<p>By spearheading NATO's eastward expansion, Secretary-General Javier Solana has erased any doubts about his commitment to the military alliance he once opposed.</p>
<p>The former Spanish foreign minister, an outspoken critic of NATO in the early 1980s, made history on May 14 when he negotiated a landmark post-Cold War treaty between Russia and the Western allies.</p>
<p>Since then, Solana has shuttled back and forth between NATO capitals, trying to forge a consensus among bickering members on how many countries from the former Soviet bloc will be invited to join when alliance leaders meet in Madrid on July 8-9.</p>
<p>The United States wants the first wave limited to three post-communist nations, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. But France and other NATO countries are pressing hard for Romania and Slovenia to be included among the new entrants.</p>
<p>While the ongoing dispute may detract from the show of unity at NATO's special summit, Solana is credited with overcoming obstacles that could have derailed the meeting altogether. &quot;He faced one of the toughest tests of any secretary-general and he never flinched,&quot; a NATO diplomat said.</p>
<p>Solana had barely settled into the alliance's top civilian job last year when he was mandated to convince Russia, NATO's former Cold War enemy, that its security would not be threatened by NATO's enlargement into territory once ruled by the Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p>Known as a patient but tough negotiator, Solana held six rounds of meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, an ex-Kremlin spymaster.</p>
<p>Primakov voiced bitter opposition to NATO's expansion but Solana made clear the alliance would go ahead whether Russia liked it or not. What emerged was the &quot;Founding Act,&quot; a treaty that allowed Russia to save face while clearing the way for NATO to accept new members from Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It marked a dramatic counterpoint to Solana's younger days. As a militant Socialist, he opposed the presence of U.S. military bases in Spain during the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, after the restoration of democracy, Solana spoke out against Spanish membership in NATO while the Socialists were in opposition. But later as a Socialist government spokesman, he had a change of heart and backed a 1986 referendum campaign in favour of keeping Spain in the alliance.</p>
<p>His anti-NATO past came back to haunt him when he was nominated secretary-general in late 1995. Conservative U.S. congressmen protested to President Bill Clinton, calling Solana a &quot;dedicated Socialist&quot; with a &quot;record of hostility to NATO,&quot; and European NATO officials also expressed some doubts.</p>
<p>But, in the words of one Spanish diplomat, NATO leaders found Solana guilty only of &quot;juvenile delinquency&quot; and went on to ratify him to replace Willy Claes, who had resigned because of a corruption scandal in his native Belgium.</p>
<p>Solana -- a veteran politician credited with helping Spain emerge from the isolationism of Franco's rule -- was the compromise choice after the United States and its European allies failed to agree on two other candidates.</p>
<p>But the bearded Spaniard immediately won praise for his skillful handling of negotiations with Bosnian leaders over implementation of the Dayton peace accords. Insiders say the personal rapport he developed with NATO leaders saw him entrusted with the task of hammering out a deal with Russia.</p>
<p>Nearly two months after his diplomatic triumph, Solana is still enjoying the afterglow. &quot;This is an austere job,&quot; he told the Spanish daily El Mundo. &quot;But recently I have had cause for great celebration.&quot;</p>
<p>A close ally of former Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez, the 54-year-old Solana was the clear favorite of the Socialist rank-and-file last month when Gonzalez stepped down as party chief. However, Solana quickly took himself out of the running, saying he wanted to see NATO through the first phase of its expansion.</p>
<p>But with his NATO term ending in 1999, party insiders think he is all but certain to run for prime minister in elections scheduled for the year 2000. &quot;He has never made a secret of his ambition, and he may never get a better chance,&quot; a longtime colleague said.</p>
<p>An articulate speaker with an academic air, Solana was educated in physics at Madrid University and in the United States. He is an avid sportsman, married with two children and has written more than two dozen books.</p>
