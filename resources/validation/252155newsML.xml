<p>Senior trade officials said on Thursday talks in Singapore on basic telecommunications had given a major impetus to an effort to shape a global pact in the $500 billion-a-year industry by next February's deadline.</p>
<p>The officials, from different countries involved in the long-running discussions, said final accord would almost certainly now hang on whether the United States was happy with packages put up by Asian countries.</p>
<p>&quot;In my view, there are now really strong grounds for optimism,&quot; said one key figure at the centre of the negotiations -- to resume at World Trade Organisation headquarters in Geneva early in the New Year.</p>
<p>Peter Guilford, spokesman for European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, told reporters at the WTO's first Ministerial Conference a U.S.-EU led deal on information technology products (IT) was a good omen.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope it will be a spur to encourage countries to be generous in their offers on telecommunications, which is the other big harvest we are looking for,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Much of the equipment to be covered in the IT deal -- which will remove all tariffs in the sector by the year 2000 if enough other countries sign up -- is used in telecoms.</p>
<p>A U.S. official who asked not to be identified was non-committal on how far prospects for a telecom deal had improved.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have to see in February whether there is a good enough critical mass of offers on the table,&quot; he said. &quot;But there are interesting things happening.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States pulled out of an earlier WTO bid to reach a pact by the end of April this year, saying proposals from big emerging economies on opening their market were not enough to make it worthwhile.</p>
<p>But the talks were resumed in the summer and given a kick-start last month when Washington and Brussels -- at odds on several telecom issues -- put up new packages which they said largely met each others' concerns.</p>
<p>Diplomats and officials at the WTO's first Ministerail Conference -- where the telecom issue has been a major backstage topic for negotiators -- said they were especially encouraged by a shift announced by Singapore.</p>
<p>The Conference host said on Wednesday it would now commit itself to opening up its telecoms market to all-comer competition by the end of the century -- seven years sooner than originally proposed and a two-year advance on its last offer.</p>
<p>The announcement came after a meeting of around 40 countries on the fringes of the week-long gathering, which ends on Friday with an overall Ministerial Declaration on trade committing the WTOs 128 member states to work for a deal on telecoms.</p>
<p>A senior official closely involved in the negotiations said that, apart from Singapore, South Korea, Canada and Hong Kong had pledged to table offers in Geneva soon that improved on their earlier positions.</p>
<p>Other countries seen as important for a deal -- Jamaica, a key Caribbean market, Egypt, South Africa and Poland -- had signalled they would come in, as well as Barbados, he added.</p>
<p>Malaysia, a key hold-out till now, had also hinted it might might make an offer soon, and there were signs the Philippines, Thailand and Mexico might follow suit, but Brazil -- considered vital for a deal -- was still hesitating.</p>
