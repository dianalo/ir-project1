<p>Russia's Economy Ministry has completed an economic programme until the end of 2000, which forecasts five percent annual industrial growth, better investment conditions and falling interest rates, Economy Minister Yevgeny Yasin said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The programme, recently submitted to the government, says Russian inflation rates would amount to 5-8 percent annually and the budget deficit would not be more than two percent of the gross domestic product, Yasin told a news conference.  </p>
<p>The 1997 draft budget provides for 3.3 percent budget deficit compared with 3.85 percent in 1996, but parliament has asked the government to rethink the spending plans.</p>
<p>Yasin said a fall in the budget deficit would result in a drop in the prices of government borrowing and credit rates.</p>
<p>He said yields on government securities would be one to two percent above inflation rates, while banks would charge three to five percent more than inflation rates for loans.</p>
<p>Banks now charge about 80 percent in interest, while average yields on GKO discount Treasury bills were around 50 percent annual at auctions on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Russian consumer prices rose 31.7 percent in the year to September, the lowest level since economic reforms got under way in January 1992.</p>
<p>Yasin said he expected $10 to $12 billion annually in foreign investment by the end of 2000.</p>
