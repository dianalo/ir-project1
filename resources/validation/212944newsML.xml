<p>China on Sunday said a draft law on stationing troops in Hong Kong when the British colony reverts to its control meant its soldiers there would be under tight control.</p>
<p>The measures would place strict limits on troops in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and would commit Beijing to handling the territory's military affairs according to law, the official news agency Xinhua said.</p>
<p>The draft law also had a provision detailing how Hong Kong authorities could call on People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops to maintain public order in the territory, the official Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;The draft law also stipulates the specific procedures... to be followed by the government of (Hong Kong) should it need to ask the central people's government for military assistance to maintain public order,&quot; Xinhua said without elaborating.</p>
<p>&quot;These stipulations fully respect (Hong Kong's) high degree of autonomy and lay a solid legal foundation for how to handle the relations between the future SAR government and the PLA troops,&quot; Xinhua said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, is to become a special administrative region of China when Beijing resumes control over the territory at the stroke of midnight on June 30 next year.</p>
<p>Beijing has promised the region a high degree of autonomy, saying it will empower the territory's courts to put on trial off-duty Chinese soldiers who have committed crimes there.</p>
<p>Xinhua quoted Yang Fukun, director of the legislative bureau of the Communist Party's powerful Central Military Commission, as saying the draft law mainly outlined matters of principle.</p>
<p>&quot;The People's Liberation Army troops sent by the people's government to Hong Kong are for defence purposes, and are essentially different from the British troops stationed there,&quot; Yang said. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>The arrival of Chinese troops in Hong Kong arouses much trepidation among the territory's six million residents, many of whom vividly recall the PLA's June 1989 bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing.</p>
