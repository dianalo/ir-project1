<p>Bodo tribals suspected of a bomb attack on an Indian train are one of many guerrilla movements ranging from Islamic separatists to Maoist leftists that have plagued security forces since independence in 1947.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people have died in insurgency-related violence stretching from Kashmir in the Himalayan mountains to the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>The bomb blast that killed at least 24 people on the train in Assam state on Monday shifted the nation's focus to the remote northeastern region.</p>
<p>Following are main areas of separatist or extremist violence:</p>
<p>NORTHEAST - For decades, Assam, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura -- five of the seven states in the hilly, forested northeast -- have been racked by guerrilla violence.</p>
<p>The movements are dominated by ethnic tribal groups disenchanted with New Delhi's rulers or illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.</p>
<p>India has largely contained Maoist separatists in Assam, but is busy fighting ethnic Bodos forming a radical fringe of tribals not content with regional autonomy.</p>
<p>The outlawed United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) leads a separatist movement which holds that Assam citizens have been neglected in New Delhi's development programmes.</p>
<p>Naga separatists in Nagaland state who once looked to China for Maoist inspiration are now accused of drug trafficking with Burma. The Nagas are engaged in a tribal feud with rival Kuki tribesmen in a region where head-hunting was common until a few decades ago.</p>
<p>Authorities have contained Mizo nationalists and Manipuri Maoists, but tribal guerrillas in Tripura carry out occasional attacks.</p>
<p>KASHMIR - Jammu and Kashmir, mostly Hindu India's only Moslem majority state, has been the hotbed of separatist violence since guerrillas seeking independence or merger with Islamic Pakistan launched an insurgency in 1990.</p>
<p>Dozens of militant groups are fighting New Delhi's rule in the Himalayan state. Police and hospital officials say more than 20,000 people have been killed in insurgency-related violence.</p>
<p>PUNJAB - Indian police fought a war with Sikh religious separatists in the agriculturally rich state of Punjab in the 1980s. At least 20,000 people died, according to officials.</p>
<p>In 1984, two Sikh bodyguards shot dead the prime minister Indira Gandhi after she sent army troops into the holiest Sikh shrine, the Golden Temple, to flush out militants.</p>
<p>Indian authorities successfully carried out state elections in 1992 after containing the guerrillas. But violence erupted again last year when a bomb killed the state's chief minister, Beant Singh.</p>
<p>Fresh assembly elections are scheduled for February 6 in Punjab state.</p>
<p>MAOIST ZONES - Splinter groups of Maoists, called Naxalites in India after the town of Naxalbari where their movement originated, have created &quot;liberated zones&quot; in the interior of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. In some districts of the eastern state of Bihar, low-caste Hindu radicals who espouse a Maoist ideology are locked in a clash with upper caste militias.</p>
