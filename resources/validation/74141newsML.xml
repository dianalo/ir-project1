<p>Shanghai copper futures ended mostly up on Tuesday on technical short-covering after sharp falls on Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>The most active January 1997 contract ended at 19,920 yuan ($2,399) per tonne, rising 80 yuan. It opened at an intra-day low of 19,850 and hit a high of 19,950.</p>
<p>October ended unchanged at 20,450 yuan, November rose 40 to 20,150, December 80 to 19,960, February 60 to 19,900, March 60 to 19,960 and April fell 40 to 19,910.</p>
<p>Combined volume fell to 21,430 tonnes from 71,250.  </p>
<p>Copper opened little changed after an overnight flat performance on the London Metal Exchange, and short-covering pushed the contracts to close near their intra-day highs.</p>
<p>Traders said a lack of follow-up market-moving news triggered technical short-covering from retail investors.</p>
<p>&quot;Shanghai investors believe that the short-term downward potential is limited despite current losses on the London Metal Exchange,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;But all later-maturing contracts met strong resistance at the 20,000-yuan level, which indicated the mid- and long-term trend is for a further drop,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>&quot;Decreasing volume showed that only some speculators liquidated their short positions, with most investors waiting for market-moving news,&quot; a second trader said.</p>
<p>Analysts said that the general outlook of copper was for further declines following the breakthrough of the key 20,000 yuan support level and on poor fundamentals.</p>
<p>Aluminium ended down. October fell 70 to 13,880 yuan per tonne, November 150 to 13,800 and December 50 to 13,850.</p>
<p>Combined volume fell to 430 tonnes from 1,400.</p>
<p>($1=8.3030 yuan)</p>
