<headline>RTRS-Australia Opp'n calls for further rate cut.</headline>
<dateline>CANBERRA 1996-12-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Australian opposition leader Kim Beazley said on Tuesday the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) should cut interest rates further, offsetting the effects of a high Australian dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they (RBA) should have done a one percent cut when they last addressed this issue (in November), and I think they should have addressed both the cuts earlier than they did,&quot; Beazley told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I would hope that the Reserve Bank would see its way clear to correct that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Beazley said the rising Australian dollar indicated there was a need to bring interest rates down early, boosting a basically strong economy.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar reached six year highs on Monday, reaching US$0.8198/03 at 5.00 p.m. (0600 GMT).</p>
<p>The bank's policy-setting board is meeting today.</p>
<p>Some commentators have predicted a monetary easing on Wednesday, although most expect the bank to hold off on any cut until the new year.</p>
<p>The bank cut its target for overnight cash rates by half a percentage point in both July and November, taking it to 6.5 percent in response to lower inflation and moderate wages growth.</p>
