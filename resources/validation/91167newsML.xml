<title>USA: Dollar closes broadly higher in U.S..</title>
<headline>Dollar closes broadly higher in U.S..</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>The dollar closed broadly higher, briefly trading above 112 yen for the first time in 32 months as Japanese investors continued to reject the yen.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark also hit its highest level in more than three months and mark/yen fell below 73.00 after New York Federal Reserve Bank Chairman, John Whitehead predicted the further dollar appreciation against the mark but not the yen.</p>
<p>&quot;He said dollar/yen was toppish and that the mark and European currencies could depreciate between five and 10 percent against the dollar,&quot; said Bill Bertha, chief dealer at Mellon Bank. &quot;So they cracked mark/yen pretty hard.&quot;</p>
<p>Whitehead is not a member of the Fed's policy-making body. His remarks, reported by a wire service, contributed to the overall buoyant sentiment behind dollar/mark and did little damage to dollar/yen.</p>
<p>The dollar rose to 112.10 yen in New York, getting an extra lift after Japanese Finance Minister Waturu Kubo retracted a statement he made in New York earlier this week.</p>
<p>But it closed at 111.85/90 yen, up from 111.71/76 at the open. Against the mark, the dollar rose to 1.5323/28 marks, its best performance since June 25 when it reached 1.5350; it opened at 1.5242/47 marks.</p>
<p>Before returning to Japan after attending a weekend gathering of G7 finance and central bank officials in Washington, Kubo was quoted on Monday saying he favored a &quot;strong&quot; but not necessarily a &quot;stronger&quot; dollar. But on Wednesday he said his remark had been misinterpreted.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not refer to how the dollar should move in the future at all,&quot; he said at a Tokyo briefing upon his return from the U.S. trip.</p>
<p>But comments from G7 officials early this week favoring a strong dollar have been overshadowed by substantial capital outflows from Japan and yen-denominated investments.</p>
<p>&quot;The market just senses the dollar is bid and will remain so until we see some of these investment flows slow or until the Bank of Japan hints it is close to an interest rate hike,&quot; said David Gilmore, partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics.</p>
<p>The mark has held up well in recent days against the swooning yen, reaching 73.34 before falling on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But it has been slumping elsewhere, particularly in Europe. Mark/lira continued its string of losses, reaching 991.80 in the U.S. on Wednesday, its lowest level since late July 1994.</p>
<p>The mark was put on the defensive in European trade after Bundesbank council member Hans-Juergen Koebnick said he predicted German interest rates would stay steady for some time but would not rule out more interest rate cuts.</p>
<p>But the lira continued to gain on the mark despite further comments by Koebnick that the &quot;Club Med&quot; nations of southern Europe might not meet the tough budget deficit conditions for participating in the core group of countries scheduled to start Europe's single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>His remarks echoed comments from French President Jacques Chirac which temporarily boosted the mark on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Investors fearing the mark will be replaced by a less sturdy single currency, to be called the Euro after 1999, have also been switching from marks in a search for higher yields.</p>
<p>&quot;In many ways it is in (Germany and France's) interest to keep Italy out of the first group,&quot; Gilmore said. &quot;Add in higher-yielding currencies like the lira and peseta and suddenly you've watered-down your &quot;core&quot; Euro.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the dollar rose to 1.2573/78 Swiss francs from 1.2492/02 at the open and it fell to Canadian $1.3593/98 from C$1.3603/08.</p>
<p>The pound closed at $1.5648/58, down from $1.5668/73 and the Australian dollar fell to $0.7944/49 from $0.7953/58.</p>
