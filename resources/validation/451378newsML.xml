<p>Political confrontation between the military and government in resource-rich Papua New Guinea (PNG) was likely to raise the country's political risk premium but had so far left world commodity markets unruffled, economists and traders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Political crisis in PNG, the world's tenth-largest gold producer and eighth-largest copper producer, would hit world markets only if actual developments affected mine production, Australian commodities traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's too early to say and people take it with a grain of salt until there are actual developments,&quot; John Israel, a gold bullion dealer with Macquarie Bank, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Comments by other traders contacted by Reuters were similar and followed overnight metals trading in which PNG's political standoff was shrugged aside.</p>
<p>But the political confrontation was likely to have already further damaged PNG's shaky standing as a political risk and could affect future commodities production through deterring new investment, Professor Ron Duncan of the National Centre for Development Studies at Australian National University, said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The main reason why PNG has not done better is the climate for investment is not generally good. At the moment (it has a) very significant risk premium to investment,&quot; Duncan said.</p>
<p>The standoff between PNG Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan and sacked army commander Brigadier General Jerry Singirok, had further worsened PNG's image as a political risk, he said.</p>
<p>Subsequent developments leading to Singirok's dismissal on Tuesday as head of the army might not alter that, he said.  </p>
<p>PNG's new political confrontation, over military opposition to the use of mercenaries to resolve the longstanding Bougainville secession issue, came just as risk premiums for PNG had began to settle after confusion in 1994, he said.</p>
<p>PNG's risk premiums rose in 1994 with changing government policy on national ownership of the Porgera gold mine and squabbles over landholder shares and royalty changes.</p>
<p>&quot;This will disturb things again unless things settle down quickly,&quot; Duncan said.  </p>
<p>Mineral products were worth about 67 percent of PNG's total commodity-dominated exports of almost 3.0 billion kina (US$2.2 billion) in 1995.</p>
<p>Through the major projects of Porgera (gold), Ok Tedi (copper and gold) and Misima (gold), PNG rates tenth on the world gold production list with production of about 60 tonnes.</p>
<p>When seccesionist rebels shut down the Panguna mine on Bougainville in 1989, they left Ok Tedi to produce almost all of PNG's copper. Ok Tedi's production amounted to 212,737 tonnes of copper contained in concentrates in 1995.  </p>
<p>The country's other main mineral operations include the Porgera gold mine, one of the world's richest gold mines, which produces about 900,000 ounces a year from the central highlands.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the operator of Porgera, Placer Pacific Ltd said production was continuing at a normal rate and that no disruptions to mining were expected.</p>
<p>&quot;Things are very quiet at the mine,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>PNG's other main resource asset is petroleum, with PNG Department of Mining and Petroleum estimates of known oil and gas field reserves at almost one billion barrels of oil and 21 trillion cubic feet of gas.  </p>
<p>The Kutubu field in central PNG now produces at about 100,000 barrels of oil a day.</p>
<p>Kutubu partner Oil Search Ltd's managing director Peter Botten said new developments were unlikely to be disrupted by political unrest. &quot;It is business as usual,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Political disruption would have no impact on the international coffee market, Andy Simkin of the Australian Tea and Coffee Traders Association said.</p>
<p>PNG produces a mere one percent of world coffee, about one percent of world cocoa, about 2.5 percent of world copra and about 1.5 percent of world palm oil.  </p>
<p>Sydney commodities traders also said that PNG now produces a much lower percentage of world copper and gold than 10 years ago, and that even if a coup occurred, the country's new leaders would need the export revenue commodities bring in.</p>
