<p>Danish premier Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said on Tuesday that Denmark's economic prospects were good but warned that his government's aim of balancing the public sector budget in 1997 might be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is on the right course. Not since the early 1970s have the current account surplus, public finances, inflation and unemployment as a whole been in better shape than today,&quot; Rasmussen said in a speech.</p>
<p>The premier, who was opening the parliament's 1996/97 session and outlining its legislative programme, said the economic outlook abroad was looking better after a growth slowdown.</p>
<p>At the same time, he added, the domestic economy showed returning strength, with low inflation, the lowest central bank discount rate in 60 years and growing private consumption and investment.</p>
<p>&quot;The government's target is still to balance the public sector budget by 1997, but the recent period of stagnation means that this will now be a little more difficult,&quot; Rasmussen said.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft has said that he will strive for balance next year but his draft 1997 budget, published in late August, predicted a deficit of 5.8 billion crowns, down from an expected 15.3 billion shortfall in 1996.</p>
<p>Rasmussen pledged on Tuesday to seek ways to cut official red tape for smaller businesses and to tighten government oversight of public pension and insurance funds.</p>
