<p>Hungary, eyeing NATO membership, is to decide in the next few days on a purchase of shoulder-held anti-aircraft missiles worth up to $100 million, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They added that a tender for a radar system, the next main upgrade, will be issued in February.</p>
<p>&quot;These are the first major purchases the Hungarian Defence Force is making since it was established (after the end of communism),&quot; Colonel Jeno Kopasz, the head of the Defence Ministry's acquisition bureau told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Their aim is to make our military technically compatible with NATO,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>NATO is due to name its first new members for almost two decades at a special summit in Madrid next July, and Hungary is widely seen as one of the frontrunners. NATO has made it clear, however, that it expects the east European country to upgrade the mostly communist-era equipment of its military and review its command structure.</p>
<p>The selection process of the shoulder-launched weapons began last year and after months of negotiations and two rounds of bidding, the number of bidders is now down to five, Kopasz said.</p>
<p>They are Bombardier unit Short Brothers of Northern Ireland, GM's Hughes Electronics, Sweden's Bofors, France's Matra and Germany's Daimler-Benz, Kopasz said.</p>
<p>Officials from the Defence, Trade and Finance ministries will select the winning tender sometime next week, and the name of the winner will be announced on February 14, once Finance Minister Peter Medgyessy grants his approval, Kopasz said.</p>
<p>The missiles will have to be available for countrywide deployment, he added.</p>
<p>Bidders are competing not only on price but also on the financing they can provide to Hungary, Kopasz said.</p>
<p>The costs of the purchase is expected to be in the range of $100 million, said Trade Ministry official Bela Takacs.</p>
<p>The tender for the radar system, a transaction equal or slightly greater in value than the missile deal, will most likely be published next month, Takacs said.</p>
<p>It will be an international open tender, he added.</p>
<p>The rockets and the radars will replace technically obsolete systems inherited from the time Hungary was still a member of the Warsaw Pact, Kopasz said.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a wholesale technological change since the old systems were installed,&quot; he said. &quot;Renewing our systems is vital.&quot;</p>
