<p>Suspected Moslem rebels killed up to 59 people in more massacres in hamlets near Algiers, an Algerian newspaper said on Saturday, hours after President Liamine Zeroual spoke of &quot;unequalled terror&quot; in the country.</p>
<p>Algeria's main independent dailies all reported continued killings in the five-year-old conflict. Le Matin said more than 250 people had now been killed in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>Without giving details of the slaughter or new steps to stop it, Zeroual told the nation in a televised address on Friday night: &quot;Innocent citizens, of all categories, are victims each day of a blind terrorism never equalled in other times or other places.&quot;</p>
<p>Le Matin, quoting villagers, said: &quot;Fifty-nine have been assassinated during this weekend in the centre of the country, mostly in Berroughia and in douars (villages) of Benramdane, Saouala and Baraki (near Algiers).&quot;</p>
<p>Zeroual's speech, in which he blamed foreign circles for manipulating &quot;criminals, traitors and mercenaries&quot; -- Algerian terms for Moslem fundamentalists -- brought harsh reaction from Algeria's independence war veteran Hocine Ait Ahmed.</p>
<p>Ait Ahmed, self-exiled in Switzerland, heads Algeria's Socialist Forces Front (FFS). He said: &quot;The state is unable to ensure security, and General Zeroual has nothing else to say after remaining silent for weeks but: international conspiracy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do they dare, after five years of a war that has killed more than 100,000 people, to repeat old Stalinist cliches?&quot;</p>
<p>Independent estimates put the number killed at 60,000 since violence erupted after the authorities cancelled in early 1992 a general election dominated by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS).</p>
<p>In a clear threat to future reports by Algeria's already heavily restricted independent press, the Interior Ministry on Saturday accused Algerian papers of &quot;doctoring facts to increase the number of those killed&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This will not be allowed to happen any more and will be opposed by the clarity and firmness of the law,&quot; it said in a statement read on Algerian radio.</p>
<p>Many Algerian newspapers have been closed for up to six months for reporting killings. The authorities say all security issues must be officially cleared first.</p>
<p>More than 60 media employees have also been killed in attacks blamed on Moslem rebels who accuse them of supporting the authorities and giving only their side of events.</p>
<p>Omar Belhouchet, editor of El Watan, who has survived one assassination attempt and been before Algeria's court several times, said of Zeroual's speech:</p>
<p>&quot;Those who expected new and innovative decisions, or a deeper analysis on the nature of the crisis and formulation of a political vision to give real hope to a disillusioned people, all risk to be disappointed.&quot;</p>
<p>In a fax received by Reuters, Anwar Haddam, the exiled FIS parliamentary leader, accused &quot;terror groups&quot; working for the &quot;putchists&quot; of being behind the killings.</p>
<p>The FIS uses the term &quot;putchists&quot; for military officials it says forced the 1992 cancellation of the general election.</p>
<p>Haddam was recently arrested in the United States after it rejected his application for asylum. The fax, whose authenticity it was not immediately possible to check, was datelined a prison in Virginia.</p>
<p>&quot;The FIS calls on members of the armed forces to undertake their responsibility...to confront the putchists' gang and side with the people to end the tragedy instead of choosing the generals' camp,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Zeroual has promised general elections in the first half of 1997, but in his Friday address he gave no date, vowing only that &quot;terrorism&quot; would be eradicated and Algeria would pursue its path to democracy.</p>
<p>More than 400 people have been killed in Algeria since November. At least five bombs have exploded in Algiers and 17 been defused. Others have hit nearby towns. Hundreds of people have been maimed, caught as they shopped with their families.</p>
<p>In isolated communities, whole families including infants have had their throats slit, their bodies mutilated.</p>
