<p>Peru's government and Marxist rebels were entrenched behind familiar battle lines on Tuesday with neither side willing to resume talks to end the 16-week-old hostage crisis.</p>
<p>Direct negotiations between President Alberto Fujimori's government and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) broke down on March 12, apparently over the rebels' main demand for the release of about 450 jailed comrades.</p>
<p>Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, leader of about 20 MRTA gunmen holding 72 hostages inside the Japanese ambassador's home in Lima, said on Monday there was no chance of talks until the government showed the &quot;political will&quot; to address this demand.</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing the government is doing is putting obstacles in the way,&quot; Cerpa told Reuters in an interview by walkie-talkie from within the besieged compound. &quot;So long as our demands are not listened to, we are not leaving the residence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To have direct talks there has to be something concrete -- a political will for an accord,&quot; Cerpa added.</p>
<p>The MRTA's position added to pessimism that neither side was prepared to back down and make concessions despite energetic shuttle diplomacy by a three-man guarantors' panel striving to hammer out an agenda for fresh talks.</p>
<p>In an interview late on Sunday, Fujimori said he would not send his crisis negotiator, Education Minister Domingo Palermo, for face-to-face talks until he was confident negotiations were moving forward.</p>
<p>&quot;Minister Palermo cannot go and bash heads with the MRTA, but rather (talk) in an environment in which we can say that we are making progress,&quot; Fujimori told Peru's Panamericana television network.</p>
<p>The 72 men held by the MRTA have now spent 112 nights inside the diplomatic mansion without electricity and running water and under continual vigilance by the heavily armed rebels.</p>
<p>Many of the hostages are reported to be suffering from stress-related diseases and Fujimori has not ruled out using force to end the siege if one of the captives is harmed.</p>
<p>Cerpa said regular medical check-ups by doctors entering the residence meant there were no serious health problems. &quot;The situation is not serious,&quot; the rebel leader said.</p>
<p>The crisis began on Dec. 17 when a band of MRTA rebels burst into a cocktail party thrown by Japanese Ambassador Morihisa Aoki and took more than 500 guests hostage. They released most of the captives but kept an elite group including Aoki, two government ministers, Fujimori's brother, the Bolivian ambassador and two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats.</p>
<p>With no visible progress in Latin America's longest hostage siege, Peru's Congressional President Victor Joy Way asked Tokyo on Monday to be patient in waiting for a peaceful solution to the standoff.</p>
<p>&quot;We must not set deadlines which will put pressure on ourselves. Impatience is our worst enemy in this process,&quot; Joy Way told local radio station Radioprogramas del Peru in an interview from Tokyo. The legislator was visiting Japan to meet Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.</p>
<p>A three-man mediating team comprised of Canadian Ambassador Anthony Vincent, Vatican representative Juan Luis Cipriani and Red Cross representative Michel Minning has shouldered the burden of maintaining contact with the rebels since talks broke down.</p>
<p>Mining visited the residence briefly on Monday afternoon while Cipriani met relatives of captive Peruvian Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela.</p>
<p>Vincent, in Bolivia on diplomatic business, discussed the crisis with Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and told reporters that both &quot;agreed on the need for a peaceful and prompt solution.&quot;</p>
