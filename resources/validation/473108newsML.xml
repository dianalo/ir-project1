<p>Up to 35 Somalis drowned while sailing to Yemen after being forced to jump overboard by their Somali crew who were high on drugs, a United Nations official on Thursday quoted survivors as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;We were told by some of them that 26 to 35 from one group died during their trip to Yemen from Somalia,&quot; Kingsley Amaing, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees representative in Yemen, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Two groups of Somali refugees, totalling about 400, had arrived by sea in Yemen on March 18, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We were told that one group of 275 people from...Somalia took a boat moving towards Yemen early this month,&quot; Amaing said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the middle of the trip, the crew members of the boat, about eight, started mistreating them because, as we were told by the survivors, the crew members were using drugs and hashish. They forced some of them to jump into the sea. That is why they died,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There are about 36,000 Somali refugees in Yemen.</p>
<p>Over 16,000 people of various nationalities have been deported from Yemen since August 1995, when it started a campaign to repatriate illegal residents.</p>
