<headline>Dollar ends mixed in U.S. after sharp dip vs yen.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The dollar ended a two-day losing streak against the mark as tensions eased regarding Europe's plans for a single currency, but dipped abruptly versus the yen due to technical trade and nervousness over Japan's trade surplus.</p>
<p>The dollar dropped sharply to a intra-day low of 111.85 yen in afternoon U.S. trade as dealers sold dollars ahead of an overnight release expected to show Japan's trade surplus grew yet again in April.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is a politically sensitive situation and the trade data itself could affirm the fact that a lot of the underlying problems with Japan have not been resolved,&quot; said John Nelson, foreign exchange trading manager at ABN AMRO Bank in Chicago.</p>
<p>The dollar quickly bounced off its low to close at 112.17/22 yen, slightly below its open of 112.45/50 and Monday's close of 112.90/00. The U.S. unit rose to 1.7183/88 marks from 1.7125/35 at the open.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen's quick recovery was due mostly to arbitrage trade as mark/yen failed to drop in tandem and suggested that an exceptionally large trade pushed the dollar to its low.  </p>
<p>&quot;What that price action tells me is a large order went through in dollar/yen,&quot; said Kevin Lawrie, global manager of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank.</p>
<p>John Gariano, a vice president at Sumitomo Bank New York, said dealers also pushed the dollar lower in an effort to trigger stop-loss sell orders below 112 yen. But the offers weren't numerous and bottom fishers quickly emerged.</p>
<p>Against the mark, the dollar steadily climbed higher as German, French and other European leaders insisted that Europe's plan to launch a single currency in January 1999 will start on time.  </p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac reaffirmed the government's committment to a punctual launch of the single currency, called the euro. He also said he hoped the European Union stability pact -- an agreement that sets out budgetary criteria for participants in monetary union -- would be agreed to at a summit in Amsterdam next Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>The remark soothed concerns sparked on Monday after France's new Socialist-led government requested a delay to study the stability pact which was widely assumed to be approved at the Amsterdam gathering.  </p>
<p>However, new French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin declined to say whether he believed the pact could be agreed to at the summit. He would only say: &quot;There are efforts to be made. We will make them.&quot;</p>
<p>Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok said the French government said it could agree to the EU stability pact before June 19, when it is due to be presented to the French National Assembly. He added that both Chirac and Jospin showed &quot;firm will&quot; during talks to find a solution regarding the pact by the end of the week.  </p>
<p>Also causing concern was a march in Paris by tens of thousands of demonstrators on Tuesday to urge the European Union to give higher priority to jobs and remind Jospin of a campaign pledge to stop further austerity in an effort to meet fiscal criteria mandatory for single-currency participants.</p>
<p>Regarding the yen, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, whose comments on Friday helped spark a sharp dollar slide, kept the pressure on Japan to control its trade surplus by repeating that the United States does not want to see a big rise in Japan's trade surplus.</p>
<p>She also expressed concern about &quot;disturbing&quot; trends in Japan's trade balance.</p>
<p>Wall Street economists expect Japan's April current account data, scheduled for release 2350 GMT Tuesday, to show a surplus of 1.1 trillion yen compared with a previous 1.0 trillion yen overflow.</p>
<p>In other trade, the dollar fell to 1.4405/15 Swiss francs from 1.4415/25 and rose to Canadian $1.3869/74 from C$1.3865/70. The British pound slipped to $1.6365/75 from $1.6383/93. The Australian dollar fell to $0.7613/18 from $0.7622/27.</p>
