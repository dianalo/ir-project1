<p>AT&amp;T Corp must grow in order to survive the coming onslaught of competition in both its core long distance business and in strategically important local phone markets, where it is struggling to gain a foothold.</p>
<p>That was the reaction among many Wall Street analysts to Tuesday's news that AT&amp;T may be in talks to merge with local phone carrier SBC Communications Inc, a mega-deal that, if consummated, would create the world's largest phone company.  </p>
<p>The view runs counter to initial reaction calling on U.S. anti-trust regulators to crackdown on what could become the latest mega-combination to reshape the industry.</p>
<p>But many financial analysts argued that AT&amp;T's reputation as a leviathan of the phone business is an antiquated holdover from the phone company's one-time status as a monopoly, a view that no longer squares with its embattled market position.</p>
<p>&quot;AT&amp;T is fighting in a situation that is the equivalent of a ten-front war, even as their main long-distance business is under attack,&quot; Bear Stearns analyst Bill Deatherage said.  </p>
<p>While AT&amp;T continues to hold upwards of 60 percent of the U.S. long distance market, it has been losing share recently, and has yet to face competition by the Baby Bells here.</p>
<p>&quot;One can argue that as large as AT&amp;T is, they are really in no position to challenge the seven Bells, GTE and all the independent companies joining the fray,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>That was reflected in the widely held investment thesis that sees Baby Bells, GTE Corp and newer upstart players as better positioned than AT&amp;T and other long-distance firms for the coming era of open competition in U.S. phone markets.  </p>
<p>The current consensus view among Wall Street analysts rates AT&amp;T stock as a neutral, well down from one year ago, when most analyts rated the stock as &quot;attractive&quot;, or a solid buy, according to figures compiled by First Call.</p>
<p>Of 24 analysts in the latest First Call survey, 18 have a neutral rating on AT&amp;T, four rate it a &quot;strong buy,&quot; one an &quot;attractive&quot; while the last sees it an &quot;underperformer.&quot;</p>
<p>Many analysts are convinced that AT&amp;T, already the largest U.S. phone company, must grow signficantly larger in scale -- while quickly extending its reach into the strategic local service market -- if it is to remain a long-term player.  </p>
<p>A merger of AT&amp;T, the leading U.S. long distance provider, and SBC, now the largest local services carrier, would create a company with more than $100 billion in revenues.</p>
<p>The deal would follow a string of huge deals including the proposed acquisition of MCI Communications Corp by British Telecommunications Plc and the merger of Bell Atlantic Corp with NYNEX Corp, as well as SBC's recent purchase of Pacific Telesis Group PAC.N.</p>
<p>Analysts have long predicted a wave of consolidation among leading industry players, including link-ups between top long-distance companies and the Baby Bells.  </p>
<p>The main surprise in reports AT&amp;T was in talks with SBC was that AT&amp;T was the first to make the leap, one analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a clear recognition by AT&amp;T that vertical integration is the way of the future in this industry,&quot; agreed Linda Meltzer, the telecoms analyst at UBS Securities.</p>
<p>Vertical integration in the context of the phone business refers to the creation of businesses capable of providing end-to-end networks supplying all aspects of a customer's communications needs -- from local service to long distance, from wireless to data commmunciations and Internet access.  </p>
<p>Both Bear Stearns and UBS Securities hold neutral views of AT&amp;T, but are bullish advocates of SBC and several other Baby Bell stocks.</p>
<p>Their view reflects a widely held Wall Street investment thesis that depicts AT&amp;T as playing defense ahead of the looming attack by local phone giants and other rivals.</p>
<p>Many financial analysts have long argued that true U.S. market power rests in the local access business -- dominated by the seven Baby Bells which were created by the split-up of AT&amp;T in 1984 and independent player GTE Corp.  </p>
<p>Current U.S. regulatory policy reflects the imbalance of power inherent in the low-cost advantages Baby Bells have via their ownership of existing local phone network facilities.</p>
<p>Baby Bells entry into long distance markets remains barred until the Bells show greater progress in opening their local turf to competition, a process of meeting a 14-point checklist set forth by U.S. regulatory law.</p>
<p>&quot;Control of the customer&quot; has become the common shorthand on Wall Street for what analysts consider to be the effective monopoly position local carriers hold on phone services.</p>
<p>Deatherage said long-distance carriers AT&amp;T, MCI Communications Corp and Sprint Corp face key strategic disadvantages against the regional Bells once regulators allow the Bells to offer long distance services.</p>
<p>Long-distance companies face the burden of making massive investments in networks, cables or wireless connections required to provide local access to business or residential customers.</p>
<p>&quot;When you look at the enormity of the project it faces, it is not clear that AT&amp;T has the resources, let alone MCI or Sprint,&quot; the Bear Stearns analyst said.</p>
