<p>China's Deng Xiaoping launched the greatest economic boom on earth and justified his reforms to doubting Marxist ideologues with one deceptively simple phrase.</p>
<p>The maxim that Deng used as an ideological figleaf to cover his near-heretical treatment of Marxist economics was &quot;socialism with Chinese characteristics&quot;.</p>
<p>The phrase that would justify private enterprise, ownership of property and lifting of price controls in a state run by the Communist Party saw the light of day in Deng's opening speech to the 12th party congress on September 1, 1982.</p>
<p>&quot;We must integrate the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete realities of China, blaze a path of our own and build a socialism with Chinese characteristics -- that is the basic conclusion we have reached after summing up long historical experience,&quot; Deng told the elders of the central committee.</p>
<p>The congress was crucial for Deng's nascent economic reforms, already running into resistance from his orthodox Marxist colleagues who feared -- rightly as it turned out -- that his employment of market forces would erode three decades of Stalinist command economics.</p>
<p>&quot;Deng's greatest contribution of all was that simple phrase 'Chinese characteristics',&quot; said one Western diplomat.</p>
<p>&quot;It ensured that you could do anything you thought was appropriate. It should be engraved on his tomb.&quot;</p>
<p>That single phrase enabled Deng to dump the revolutionary fervour nurtured by the late chairman Mao Zedong in favour of doing pretty much what he wanted.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a huge leap forward compared with the Mao era,&quot; said a Chinese political scientist. &quot;This sentence guided China on to the path of modernisation. It marked the shift from Mao's path to Deng's path and enabled Deng to do an enormous number of things.&quot;</p>
<p>It ended the sole system of public ownership. Collective and private enterprises were born. It also ended cradle-to-grave care and control by the party.</p>
<p>Chinese could be sacked, they could resign. They were free to find their own jobs. They could move house. They had to pay for their own education and medical care.</p>
<p>The command economy gave way to market forces.</p>
<p>What Deng created was no longer socialism, neither was it capitalism.</p>
<p>It was somewhere in between. It was socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>
