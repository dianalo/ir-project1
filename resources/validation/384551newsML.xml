<p>The U.S. government has offered to help Venezuela track down an American oil engineer kidnapped near the Colombian border last week, an embassy spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Jerel Shaffer, an employee of the Houston, Texas-based Production Operators Inc., was snatched on Friday with his Venezuelan pilot at the beginning of a fishing holiday in the southwestern Apure state.</p>
<p>&quot;When the plane of the kidnapped American flew into the fishing camp he was met by between six and eight armed individuals who took him, his pilot and the plane,&quot; the U.S. embassy official said.</p>
<p>Neither Shaffer, who works in Venezuela, nor his captors have been heard from since. &quot;They certainly haven't contacted the embassy and we're not aware that they have contacted the company or family,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Venezuelan authorities have said the pair were most likely victims of increasingly frequent incursions by leftist Colombian guerrillas.</p>
<p>Two Venezuelan oil engineers were snatched in Apure, more than 530 miles (850 km) southwest of Caracas, last week. Defence Minister Nicolas Valencia said seven people had been kidnapped near the Colombian border in the past seven days.</p>
<p>Valencia, who last week ordered security to be stepped up at oil installations along the frontier, said another kidnapping was narrowly averted on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;An anti-kidnapping plan was activated and a woman and a child were rescued and one person arrested,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kidnapping, smuggling and drug trafficking along Venezuela's 1,400-mile (2,200-km) sparsely populated border with Colombia has increasingly strained relations between the two countries.</p>
