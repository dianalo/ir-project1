<p>Owens Corning said on Tuesday it is comfortable with earnings estimates in the ranges of $4.50 to $4.75 per fully diluted share for 1997.</p>
<p>The company said its Building Materials business remains strong, and the company expects the momentum to continue through the remainder of 1997.</p>
<p>However, Owens Corning said it does not see the Composites business improving significantly over the first quarter. Therefore, the company said, it will not meet its business plan for Composite Materials.  </p>
<p>Owens Corning said it remains confident that it will reach its goal of $5 billion in sales by 1999, and with the initiatives already in place, the company will continue its focus on growth and productivity.</p>
<p>The comapny said its sales in Composite Materials decreased seven percent compared to the first quarter of 1996, with pricing weakness in Europe, along with customer inventory adjustments and increased competition in the United States responsible for the decline.  </p>
<p>Total composites income from operations was down 17 percent, however, composites remains a very profitable part of company business, with an income from operations ratio of 18 percent, Owens Corning said.</p>
<p>The company said that in January it began to see signs of improvement in European composites, and volume for the quarter was slightly stronger than the fourth quarter of 1996, however the market remains extremely competitive, and pricing pressure continues.  </p>
<p>The European improvement in the first quarter led to positive income from operations compared to the loss experienced in the fourth quarter of 1996, the company said.</p>
<p>Building Materials earnings from ongoing operations increased 21 percent over the year-ago quarter, while sales for the period grew eight percent, Owens Corning said.</p>
<p>Owens Corning said it saw double-digit growth in its roofing and specialty and foam businesses. While strength in the contractor and remodeler market offset some weakness in the retail sector, productivity gains in our insulation business increased profitability significantly, the company said.</p>
<p>Building Materials volume in Europe increased 11 percent on the strength of our product quality and the successful integration of new acquisitions, Owens Corning said.</p>
<p>In spite of these successes, a weak European economy continues to have a negative impact on income from operations, the company said.</p>
