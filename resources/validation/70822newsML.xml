<p>Once a political monolith, India's Congress party has lost clout with the demise of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty and the maturing of the nation's democracy, analysts and historians said on Monday.</p>
<p>But while the resignation of former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao as party leader is an embarrassing blow to Congress, the party identified with Indian independence and non-alignment will remain a major political force, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think you can write off Congress,&quot; said Rasheed Talib, a veteran independent political commentator.</p>
<p>The party was grappling on Monday with fallout from Rao's weekend decision to step down after a court upheld a summons ordering him to appear in a criminal conspiracy case.</p>
<p>Senior leaders were set to gather on Monday evening to choose a stop-gap leader to carry the reins until the party's plenary body meets, probably before the year end.</p>
<p>Formed in 1885, Congress has ruled India for nine-tenths of the nation's history since independence in 1947.</p>
<p>Synonomous with Indian nationalism, it has been the political home for Mahatma Gandhi, the nation's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi and her son, Rajiv Gandhi.</p>
<p>Congress has spent only four years out of power since 1947, and, helped by a wave of sympathy following Rajiv Gandhi's assassination at the hands of a suicide bomber, rebounded in 1991 to recapture control after 18 months on the sidelines.</p>
<p>But despite broad support for Rao's foreign policies and free-market economics, Congress was thrown out of office in general elections ended in May in its worst ever showing.</p>
<p>During Rao's five-year tenure, the party was undermined by intra-party rivalries and corruption scandals.</p>
<p>Ironically, Mahatma Gandhi had called for the dissolution of Congress after freedom was won.</p>
<p>The nation's spiritual founding father, who dominated the organisation for many years before independence, believed the vast, umbrella organisation was not needed in a democracy.</p>
<p>But Congress remained the dominant political party for 30 years after independence, underpinned by its broad geographical reach, its association with the nationalist movement and its charismatic leaders, Nehru and Indira Gandhi.</p>
<p>Eventually Congress's strengths -- centralised leadership and a penchant for domineering chiefs -- proved weaknesses as Indira Gandhi was routed in the 1977 general election.</p>
<p>More generally, Congress's base among the lower castes and the Moslem minority has eroded with time.</p>
<p>The dynasty has faded, although a segment of Congress still turns to Rajiv Gandhi's widow, Sonia, for direction. But she is not expected to enter the political fray.</p>
<p>New parties have sprung up to defend the dispossessed, and the Moslems have deserted Congress in a large numbers, accusing the party of failing to protect them against communal violence.</p>
<p>Many Sikhs, too, left Congress. They accuse it of sparking anti-Sikh riots in 1984 after Indira Gandhi was gunned down by Sikh bodyguards.</p>
<p>&quot;Congress has lost support because its factions have become separate parties,&quot; said Ashis Nandy of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies.</p>
<p>Congress polled 28.8 percent of the vote in recent general elections -- the first time it fell below 30 percent.</p>
<p>But Nandy said one fifth of the electorate continued to be die-hard Congress supporters, giving it a solid base, and it had the advantage of occupying the political centre between right-wing Hindu nationalists and a range of left-wing parties.</p>
<p>&quot;Congress provides the natural point of gravitation for a sizeable segment of the Indian people,&quot; Nandy said.</p>
<p>Its ability to rebound will depend largely on its choice of leader, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Congress needs a sharp, surgical operation,&quot; Vinod Mehta, editor of Outlook magazine said. &quot;It needs to demonstrate it realises the follies of the past and choose a man who can take the party in new directions.&quot;</p>
