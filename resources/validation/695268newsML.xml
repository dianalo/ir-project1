<p>With Congress moving to reimpose strict export controls on supercomputers, industry participants warned that the legislation under consideration would affect a much broader range of machines.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives last week approved a 1998 budget for the Department of Defense that would restrict exports of U.S. computers capable of more than 2 billion theoretical operations per second.  </p>
<p>The Senate will take up the defense budget next week with Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, planning to offer an amendment with the supercomputer export limit.</p>
<p>&quot;Policies like this that fail to consider technology advances and the realities of the global marketplace do only one thing: hand the advantage to our foreign competition,&quot; Hewlett Packard Co chairman Lewis Platt said.</p>
<p>High-end desktop computers will cross the 2 billion operation threshold soon, Fred McNeese, spokesman for International Business Machines Corp, explained.  </p>
<p>Ordinary desktop computers costing a few thousand dollars are reaching 200 million operations. &quot;This isn't just supercomputers,&quot; McNeese said.</p>
<p>The legislation also failed to consider the impact of advances in networking technology that permit dozens of weak computers to be linked together to run a single program at the speed of a supercomputer, said Gregory Garcia, director for international trade affairs at the American Electronics Association.  </p>
<p>The limits would require a U.S. company to apply for permission on a case-by-case basis to export computers to any country that may be researching nuclear weapons, including Russia, Israel and China.</p>
<p>With the threshold set at 2 billion operations, &quot;the government won't be able to handle the thousands and thousands of applications that will have to be filed,&quot; IBM's McNeese said.</p>
<p>In some cases, the computer purchaser would have to agree to keep a 24-hour guard posted at the computer or even ask permission to alter the computer's software.  </p>
<p>The legislation would reverse a 1995 decision by the Clinton administration to roll back export limits on computers capable of up to 7 billion operations per second.</p>
<p>The Pentagon supported the move at the time, but opposition has grown in Congress following reports of alleged improper sales of supercomputers to nuclear research facilities in Russia and China by IBM and Silicon Graphics.  </p>
<p>The computer industry &quot;has not demonstrated that it can be trusted,&quot; a congressional staffer working on the legislation said. &quot;There are concerns that some serious breaches have occurred.&quot;</p>
<p>Administration officials continue to oppose reimposing broad controls, however.</p>
<p>&quot;Controlling computers today with complete effectiveness would really mean individually licensing computers down to the level of those in your office,&quot; Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch testified earlier this month. Such a policy &quot;would be absurd administratively and disasterous economically.&quot;</p>
<p>The computer industry is backing a compromise amendment to be offered by Sen. Rod Grams, Republican of Minnesota.</p>
<p>That proposal would require the General Accounting Office to study the issue and require the government to issue a list of suspect purchasers to help computer companies avoid improper sales.</p>
