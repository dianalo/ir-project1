<text>
<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures weakened slightly on Thursday in thin volumes with most of Europe absent due to May Day public holidays, traders said.</p>
<p>June IPE Brent was trading 10 cents lower at $18.42 a barrel, while May gas oil was 50 cents lower at $171.75 a tonne at 1012 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;It opened in line with expectations,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Traders attributed the losses to weakness on NYMEX overnight. June crude was seven cents off at $20.14 on ACCESS.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen a little bit of pressure, margins have narrowed but there's not really that much going on,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>The June IPE/NYMEX crude spread stood at $1.68 a barrel at 1022 GMT.</p>
<p>Some players said the fact June Brent had failed to fill a key downside gap up to $18.77, despite the fact it got as high as $18.75, had put of a dampener on bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>The May Day holiday meant many European players were absent from the market.</p>
<p>Gas oil was slightly lower as it consolidated recent gains and a few players took profits.</p>
