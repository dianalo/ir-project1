<p>Indian shares are likely to weaken in a subdued market ahead of next week's budget but lingering optimism could prevent any sharp losses, analysts said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets have shown a total lack of conviction,&quot; said Ramesh Damani, a member-broker of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). &quot;Indecisiveness on the part of bull and bear operators might lead to choppy trading.&quot;</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram will present the 1997/98 (April-March) budget to Parliament on February 28.</p>
<p>The BSE's benchmark 30-share index tumbled 82 points, or nearly 2.3 percent, in lacklustre trade, to close at 3,439.49 in the week ending Friday.</p>
<p>Brokers said the budget was not likely to contain any radical initiatives to accelerate the reform process.</p>
<p>&quot;People are not very optimistic. There is a general feeling that the government cannot take bold steps,&quot; Kamal Kabra, a former BSE president, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Brokers said the government could boost confidence by diluting a new minimum tax on firms, allowing companies to buy back their shares and eliminating double taxation on company dividends.</p>
<p>Present laws require investors to pay taxes on dividends paid out of already taxed profits of companies.</p>
<p>But brokers said the fractious 13-party centre-left coalition could block Chidambaram from taking any radical moves to cut expenditure.</p>
<p>The budget was expected to focus on reversing the economic slowdown, boosting infrastructure investment and exports, as well as introducing measures to encourage Foreign Direct Investment, local brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said in a pre-budget study.</p>
<p>India's industrial growth as measured by the index of industrial production (IIP) slowed to 9.8 percent in the period from April to October last year, against 11.7 percent in the corresponding period the previous year.</p>
<p>Inflation rose to a 58-week high of 7.75 percent year-on-year in the week ending January 4.</p>
<p>Brokers expect the government will encourage further private participation in Indian infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>&quot;The budget will give an opportunity for the government to go ahead in the reforms process. A lot still remains to be done, especially in the infrastructure sector,&quot; said Parag Parikh, a leading BSE broker.</p>
<p>&quot;Aside from the political reservations, I believe that the reforms process would be given a push and if that is done, I see the market taking a bullish stance,&quot; Parikh said.</p>
