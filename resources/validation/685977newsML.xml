<p>Shun Tak Holdings Ltd said on Wednesday it sought to improve its Hong Kong-Macau ferry business by improving the overall market rather than just boosting its market share.</p>
<p>&quot;If we want to ensure our position and our foothold in our shipping business, we must open up our mind and be able to conceive bringing the opportunities of other tourism products, developments into play,&quot; executive director Pansy Ho said.</p>
<p>She told reporters the firm was working with the government of Portuguese-administered Macau to enhance the quality of Macau's tourism products so as to expand the market of Hong Kong-Macau traffic.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully by next year I can tell you that the total market has grown and that we maintained our market share. I think that will be a healthy position,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Shun Tak's market share of passenger traffic to Macau has fallen to 68-70 percent compared with over 70 percent last year because of increased competition, she said.</p>
<p>But the firm was happy with a market share of about 70 percent, Ho said.</p>
<p>She said the company had applied to the Macau government for a fare rise which was expected to come into effect around September.</p>
<p>Shun Tak hoped the rise would be more than last year's increase rate of six percent, she said.</p>
<p>The conglomerate, which started as a shipping firm, was looking at other opportunities, Ho said.</p>
<p>&quot;Shipping is a mature business. At the moment we are looking at other opportunities,&quot; she said, noting the company was already engaged in property development business in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;We are also looking into the property market of Macau and how to again bring about a revival in that market,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The company could invest in Macau's property sector should the market recover, she said.</p>
