<p>Jakarta stocks are seen flat in slow trading on Tuesday as sentiment remain cautious ahead of the Thursday's general election, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bargain-hunting in some big-caps is likely to continue, but trading volume is likely to stay small because of the cautious sentiment ahead of the election day,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Semen Gresik was expected to remain among the targets of bargain-hunting. At its Monday's closing price of 5,650 rupiah, the cement maker was considered attractive, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Smal-capitalised property firm Mas Murni was likely to stay active on continued market talk of a possible take-over, brokers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said a lack of fresh corporate news was also seen keeping the market slow.</p>
<p>The Jakarta composite index rose 4.67 points to close at 663.20 points on Monday.</p>
<p>The broker said buying these stocks could provide huge gains, provided the timing was right.</p>
<p>Shares belonging to the Lippo Group, including Lippo Securities, Lippo Land and Lippo Land were among the gainers, but volumes were small, brokers said.</p>
