<p>Istanbul shares eased in cautious trade on Friday due to continuing tension between Iraq and the U.S., but rebounded from early lows on support awaited at near the index's 64,000 level, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB-100 closed at 64,779.26, down 359.67 points, or 0.55 percent from Thursday, but up from a low of 64,277. It had leapt 3.55 percent in the last three days on minor cash entry, but failed to pierce 65,500 resistance.</p>
<p>Over the week, the index gained 2.1 percent after last week's 1.7 percent loss.</p>
<p>Trade volume dropped to 7.59 trillion lira from Thursday's 8.33 trillion.</p>
<p>Brokers said buyers were unwilling to buy shares ahead of the weekend due to the possibility of new U.S. military strikes on Iraq which sparked sales in the morning.</p>
<p>&quot;Selling was already expected today after yesterday's profit-taking. Some late reaction buys emerged due to support awaited at 64,000,&quot; said Nazmi Sarikaya from Disbank.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the index to fluctuate within the 64,000-65,000 range in coming days,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The 85-share industrial index  eased 0.73 percent to 71,039.94 and the 15-share financial index edged 0.09 percent lower to 57,430.8. Of the 220 shares traded, gainers outdid losers by 126 to 37 and 57 closed steady.</p>
<p>Actives were led by largely state-owned flat steel giant Eregli, down 200 lira at 9,200 and T.Isbank's C series shares, up 300 lira at 10,000. -- Aydan Eksin, Istanbul newsroom +90-212-275 0875.</p>
