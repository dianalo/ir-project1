<headline>Brazil shrs end higher to close year on quiet note.</headline>
<dateline>SAO PAULO 1996-12-30</dateline>

<p>Brazilian stocks closed up in weak trade as those investors not on holiday engaged in light buying and selling to round out a spectacular 1996 and prop up prices ahead of 1997, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a slow, peaceful day. Nothing happened,&quot; said broker Evandro dos Reis Junior of Indusval brokerage.</p>
<p>The Sao Paulo bourse's Bovespa index  of 49 most-traded shares rose 0.47 percent to end at 70,399 points on turnover of 171.6 million reais ($165 million).  </p>
<p>The lackluster session contrasted sharply with the end-of-year party that erupted at the close of trade on the Sao Paulo bourse as brokers and traders celebrated the end of 1996, a year that saw the bolsa surge 63 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;1997 will also be a promising year,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>The bolsa is closed Tuesday and Wednesday for the New Year's holiday and will reopen on Thursday, when the upward trend is expected to continue in weak turnover.</p>
<p>Among blue chips, benchmark Telebras preferred rose 0.19 percent to close at 80 reais.  </p>
<p>The session also saw rises in leaders Petrobras preferred, Eletrobras preferred B and Cemig preferred after the federal government sold minority holdings in these and other firms in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>Petrobras preferred ended up 0.61 percent at 165.50 reais, Eletrobras B climbed 0.78 percent to end at 386 reais and Cemig jumped 2.91 percent to close at 35.40 reais.</p>
<p>The biggest loser among blue-chips was state mining giant Cia Vale do Rio Doce preferred, which dropped 0.99 percent to close at 20 reais.  </p>
<p>The bolsa's Electrical Energy Index of nine most liquid power shares gained 1.81 percent to close at 1,940 points, led by Cemig and Eletrobras.</p>
