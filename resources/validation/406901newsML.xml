<headline>GDR REPORT - Indian GDRs firm, anticipating budget.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-27</dateline>

<p>Indian global depositary receipts (GDRs) ended generally firmer on the back of the Bombay market but traders said activity was muted ahead of Friday's budget.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been market-maker driven,&quot; said one GDR dealer after Thursday's mainly quiet session. &quot;Generally GDR prices closed firmer on the back of Bombay and investors are waiting to see what the budget brings.&quot;</p>
<p>India's finance minister is due to announce the country's 1997-98 budget for the fiscal year starting on April 1 at 1130 GMT on Friday, and traders say they are looking for renewed commitment to economic reform.</p>
<p>&quot;The big question is, will the second phase of the reform process be addressed,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>&quot;The lack of political will to reach consensus agreement within such a large and fractious coalition government raises doubts on major reforms being pushed through,&quot; added Deepal Lalwani at Astaire &amp; Partners in London.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic growth as a result may not be as good as predicted.&quot;</p>
<p>Reliance GDRs rose 50 cents to $15.50; SBI climbed 50 cents to $20.00, while Bjaj Autos climbed $1.38 to $35.25.</p>
<p>The HSBC James Capel Indian GDR index  JCEAI closed up 1.52 points, or 2.28 percent, at 68.25 points, with the premium over the local market at 15.52 percent.</p>
<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share index closed up 1.87 percent at 3427.87.</p>
<p>Korean GDRs eased in line with the Seoul share market, which weakened on rumours of financial difficulties at Sammi Corp and active selling by foreign investors.</p>
<p>The Capel Korea GDR Index ended down 1.34 points, or 2.25 percent, at 58.22, offering a premium of 34.46 percent over the local market. The Korea Composite Index fell 10.30 points to end at 669.41.</p>
<p>Taiwan GDRs meanwhile followed the underlying market to a slightly higher close after signs of a gathering recovery triggered local bargain hunting.</p>
<p>The Capel Taiwan GDR Index ended 2.19 points, or 2.18 percent higher at 102.58, giving a premium of 1.24 percent over the local market. The Taiwan Weighted Index rose 1.31 percent to 7,832.07. -- Caroline Brothers, London Newsroom +44 171 542 2734</p>
