<title>USA: NHL-OILERS' CZERKAWSKI GETS NATURAL HAT TRICK AGAINST OLD TEAM.</title>
<headline>NHL-OILERS' CZERKAWSKI GETS NATURAL HAT TRICK AGAINST OLD TEAM.</headline>
<dateline>BOSTON 1996-11-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Former Bruin Mariusz Czerkawski recorded a natural hat trick -- the first of his career --- and Curtis Joseph posted his second shutout of the season as the Edmonton Oilers blanked slumping Boston 6-0 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Czerkawski, acquired from the Bruins last January in the deal that sent goaltender Bill Ranford to Boston, entered the game with two goals in his first 11 contests.</p>
<p>&quot;Scoring a hat trick is a great feeling but another place you want to score is probably in the same city you played before and got traded from,&quot; Czerkawski said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's always a little extra and a little special. That was a great win, 6-0, it couldn't be better than that. Tonight's my first hat trick, it's tough to complain.&quot;</p>
<p>Joseph made 25 saves for his seventh career shutout and second with the Oilers. It was Edmonton's first-ever shutout in Boston.</p>
<p>After Miroslav Satan gave the Oilers a 1-0 lead 4:34 into the contest, Czerkawski made it 2-0 less than three minutes later. He one-timed Todd Marchant's pass in the slot through goaltender Scott Bailey's pads.</p>
<p>Czerkawski's second goal of the game with 6:43 left in the second period extended Edmonton's lead to 3-0. Bailey made a pad save on Jason Arnott's shot from the left circle, but Czerkawski banged in the rebound from the right side.</p>
<p>Czerkawski completed his first career hat trick with 1:54 to play in the second, working a perfect give-and-go with Kelly Buchberger and making a one-timer from the slot.</p>
<p>Marchant added a shorthanded goal 47 seconds later for a 5-0 advantage.</p>
<p>Buchberger had three assists and Michel Petit added his first goal of the season for the Oilers, who won their first game on a season-high six-game road trip.</p>
<p>Bailey, making just his third start of the season with Ranford nursing a right knee injury, made 35 saves and fell to 0-3.</p>
<p>&quot;It seemed to me like they just kept coming and coming,&quot; Bailey said. &quot;I'm just happy they didn't get 12 because it was highly possible, they had enough opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p>In Buffalo, Mikael Renberg's goal midway through the third period snapped a tie and John LeClair sealed the victory with his second tally of the game as the Philadelphia Flyers defeated the Sabres 5-2.</p>
<p>LeClair, who had two goals and two assists, after a slow start coinciding with the absence of linemate Eric Lindros has four goals and three assists in his last two games.</p>
<p>Philadelphia's Ron Hextall allowed goals on two of the first three shots he faced, but rallied to turn aside the last 12 Buffalo attempts.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Brian Rolston and Jason Smith scored 65 seconds apart in a three-goal second period and rookie Mike Dunham made 35 saves as the New Jersey Devils got their season-high third straight win, 4-2 over the Blackhawks.</p>
<p>Dunham, who was making his first NHL start, became the first goaltender other than Martin Brodeur to win for the Devils in nearly a year.</p>
<p>Valeri Zelepukin and Dave Andreychuk scored the other goals for the Devils, who improved to 3-3 on the road and broke a five-game winless streak against Chicago.</p>
<p>Chris Chelios set up both goals for the Blackhawks, who had not lost to New Jersey since October 1992.</p>
<p>At Florida, four different players scored goals and Johan Garpenlov and Robert Svehla each had two assists to lift the Panthers to a 4-2 victory over the Washington Capitals.</p>
<p>The Panthers, who took the first nine shots of the game, improved to 9-1-4.</p>
<p>John Vanbiesbrouck recorded 24 saves to improve his record to 7-1-3. The Panthers have allowed a NHL-low 25 goals and have surrendered more than three in a game only once.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, Steve Duchesne and Daniel Alfredsson each had a goal and two assists and Damian Rhodes made 31 saves against his former team as the Senators snapped a four-game winless streak with a 6-2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs.</p>
<p>Denny Lambert added a goal and an assist and Randy Cunneyworth and Denis Chasse each contributed two assists for the Senators, who remained unbeaten at home (3-0-3) and posted their first-ever win over Toronto in eight tries (1-6-1).</p>
<p>At Los Angeles, Vitali Yachmenev, Yanic Perreault and Ed Olczyk scored third-period goals and Byron Dafoe made 27 saves, helping the Kings stretch their unbeaten streak to six games with a 4-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
<p>Rob Blake also scored for the Kings, who improved to 3-0-3 in their last six games.</p>
<p>Darcy Tucker scored his first NHL goal for Montreal, which dropped to 1-6-1 on the road this season.</p>
