<title>UK: Lloyds, banks up in post-budget surge.</title>
<headline>Lloyds, banks up in post-budget surge.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Lloyds TSB Group Plc and other UK banking groups shot higher on Thursday, leading a sharp recovery in the UK's FTSE 100 index in frantic post-Budget trade as a press report renewed bid speculation in the sector.</p>
<p>Dealers said banks remained in favour for their domestic earnings, insulated from the effects of sterling's strength, for their strong financial position and for the prospects of further bids and mergers in the industry.</p>
<p>Equally a report in the Daily Telegraph that Lloyds was considering a takeover approach for building society Nationwide helped spark a fresh bout of the takeover bid speculation that has swirled around the sector for months, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Lloyds was up 19-1/2p at 665-1/2 by 1039 GMT in volume of almost five million shares, after earlier rising as much as 27p to a record 673p.</p>
<p>Barclays Plc was up 46p at 12.58-1/2 stg, Abbey National Plc was up 29p at 891, Halifax Plc was up 7p at 774-1/2 and National Westminster Bank Plc was up 17-1/2p at 877.</p>
<p>&quot;Financially they are very strong and they are able to grow earnings and dividends faster than the market, and there is going to be more corporate activity,&quot; said a senior dealer at one top U.S. investment bank.</p>
<p>He said it was still hard to see the recent outperformance of bank stocks rolling over into out-of-favour sectors such as stores and engineers.</p>
<p>&quot;You just can't afford to be out of this (bank) sector because if you are you get crucified...you have to ask at what point there is going to be some sector rotation, but if you start to sell, what other big sectors look attractive?&quot;</p>
<p>Citing an unnamed Lloyds insider, the Daily Telegraph said Lloyd's planning department was examining the potential synergies and possible cost of a bid for Nationwide, though any recommendation to the board was some way off.</p>
<p>It said Lloyds would consider a bid if Nationwide members support a group pressing for it to be converted to publicly-quoted status and is putting up candidates for the building society's board at its annual meeting on July 24.</p>
<p>A Lloyds spokeswoman declined comment on what she said was market speculation.</p>
