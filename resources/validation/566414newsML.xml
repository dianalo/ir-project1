<headline>CME begins S. African, New Zealand currency trade.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday began trading futures and options on the currencies of New Zealand and South Africa, the latest additions to the CME's currency quadrant.</p>
<p>Overall rand volume on Wednesday was an estimated 214 contracts, all of that in the lead month June  RAM7. New Zealand dollar volume was estimated at eight contracts, also all in June  NEM7.</p>
<p>&quot;The rand was actually very successful,&quot; said Scott Brusso, CME director of currency and interest rate marketing. &quot;We had quite a bit of different interest -- banks from South Africa and banks out of New York and London.&quot;</p>
<p>An inverse product also launched Wednesday at the South Africa Futures Exchange traded 20 contracts.</p>
<p>CME officials have called South Africa a vital emerging market since the relaxation of foreign exchange controls there earlier this year. They said the &quot;reintegration&quot; of South Africa into the world economy provides risk management opportunities.</p>
<p>CME South African rand contracts are sized at 500,000 rand, or about $112,000 at current levels. The contract is quoted in terms of U.S. dollars per rand, and the minimum price increment, or tick, of $0.000025 equals $12.50.</p>
<p>New Zealand dollar contracts trade in the Australian dollar futures pit, giving those market participants access to the &quot;kiwi&quot; contract.</p>
<p>New Zealand dollar futures are sized at 100,000 New Zealand dollars, or about $71,000 at current levels. It is quoted in terms of U.S. dollars per N.Z. dollar and the minimum tick of $0.0001 equals $10.00.</p>
