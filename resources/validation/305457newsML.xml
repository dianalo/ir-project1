<p>President Boris Yeltsin is playing a strong but risky card against both NATO and domestic rivals by planning to speed up a merger between Russia and Belarus.</p>
<p>Western experts and opposition politicians alike conceded on Tuesday that he had grabbed the initiative by sending a letter to Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko on Monday suggesting faster moves towards unification.</p>
<p>But they also expressed doubt over how long Yeltsin, in hospital with pneumonia, would be able to hold his advantage and said he may end up regretting Monday's move.</p>
<p>Unity with Belarus would worry the West, reviving some of Moscow's lost influence. But Russia, facing its own political and economic problems, could be destabilised by its neighbour's unreformed economy and ties with the power-hungry Lukashenko.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe this is a card in the ongoing poker-match between East and West over NATO enlargement,&quot; said one Western expert based in Moscow.</p>
<p>Russian officials have made it plain that the Kremlin sees the threat of a union with Belarus as a useful weapon in its losing battle against the Western alliance's plans to take in countries from the former Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>Sergei Shakhrai, deputy head of the Kremlin administration, said on Monday unification could be the best response to any NATO expansion move, sending the message, &quot;If you go East, we will go West&quot;.</p>
<p>The move also steals the thunder from politicians at home at a time when Yeltsin, dogged by ill health, is under pressure over his health problems and a budget crisis which has left millions of people without pay or pensions for several months.</p>
<p>&quot;The Belarussian card, which has become fashionable in recent times, has been played again,&quot; said Alexander Lebed, the ambitious former paratroop general who has been back on the warpath since Yeltsin went down with pneumonia last week.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea itself is a good one, but considering the timing of the announcement, it looks like another attempt to divert Russian society's attention away from vital internal state problems,&quot; he told Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>Lebed and Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the opposition Communist Party, were cornered by Yeltsin's proposal. They, like many Russians, look with yearning to the days of the Soviet superpower.</p>
<p>Other opposition politicians shared Lebed's scepticism of Yeltsin's vague proposal to conduct referendums on unification &quot;in one form or another&quot;, given the lack of progress in integration moves announced before his re-election last year.</p>
<p>But some saw it as an opportunity to win concessions from NATO.</p>
<p>Sergei Baburin, the nationalist deputy speaker of the lower house of parliament, told Interfax that Russia and Belarus should unite by July, when NATO is expected to issue membership invitations to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Such an alliance &quot;could prevent the entry of the Baltic states and other states into NATO&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>Russia is particularly anxious not to see Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, formerly part of the Soviet Union, in NATO. Some countries may have a long wait for membership but NATO officials have ruled out Russia having the right to veto any members.</p>
<p>Western experts saw the integration proposal as a clever ploy but said Moscow would take on a heavy economic burden.</p>
<p>&quot;This would be a development which would cause concern in the West,&quot; said one Western expert, referring to the prospect of creating a new dividing line through central Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;But as soon as there is some sort of merger, other CIS states will reconsider their position towards Moscow, which they eye with scepticism. Russia will also have to carry an economically impotent country.&quot;</p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, loosely groups 12 of the 15 former Soviet republics.</p>
<p>Lukashenko, isolated by the West for avoiding economic reforms and crushing political dissent, welcomed Yeltsin's proposal to eventually create one government, budget and currency and unify tax laws and fuel and energy systems.</p>
<p>But Russia's NTV commercial television said Moscow was playing a risky game with the hardline Belarus leader. He has already boosted his powers at home and it cannot be ruled out that he might make a play for the presidency of a unified state.</p>
<p>&quot;A union with Belarus gives Lukashenko a pass into Russian political life. There is every reason to believe that there could be unpredictable consequences. Russia and its neighbours could all suffer,&quot; NTV said.</p>
