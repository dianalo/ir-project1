<title>USA: CBOT soymeal ends higher on Brazil, soyoil lower.</title>
<headline>CBOT soymeal ends higher on Brazil, soyoil lower.</headline>

<p>CBOT soymeal futures settled firmer but off fresh contract highs set during the session, on news that Brazil's stevedores planned a nationwide port strike and on reports dry weather would cut Brazil's soybean production, traders said. Soyoil ended lower on a late spate of fund selling, sources said.</p>
<p>Soymeal rallied to fresh contract highs which were also 8-1/2 year peaks on news Brazil's stevedores were on strike at Santos port and had called for a nationwide strike on Friday. But reports the key port of Paranagua had no plans yet to participate knocked soymeal off the day's highs. Paranagua ships more soybeans and soymeal than Santos.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be some strikes in Brazil,&quot; said Bob Lekberg of Goldenberg-Hehmeyer. &quot;Whether that impacts the port of Paranagua is uncertain but that was still a sustaining factor.&quot;</p>
<p>Soymeal was further bolstered by news soybean production in Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul could fall to 5.25 million tonnes from an earlier estimate of 5.68 million, according to a division of the state's agricultural secretariat.</p>
<p>Soymeal ended $4.00 to $1.30 a ton higher with May up $2.70 at $294.90. Soyoil closed 0.08 cent a lb lower to unchanged. May soyoil was down 0.06 at 24.10 cents.  </p>
<p>Soyoil drew support early from Egypt's purchase of 21,000 tonnes of soyoil. Traders also cited speculation that Taiwan would buy soyoil.</p>
<p>Taiwan's foot and mouth hog crisis has begun hitting the island's edible oil producers, who said on Wednesday that a fall in demand for soy-based feed was forcing them to cut production and turn to oil imports.</p>
<p>U.S. cash sources said Taiwan was seeking sunoil and soyoil from U.S. and South American sources.</p>
<p>On the day, ADM sold 300 lots May and 200 lots July soymeal. Prudential Securities sold 300 May and FIMAT Futures sold 400 July.</p>
<p>In soyoil, Tenco Inc bought 200 lots May, 300 July and 50 December while ADM sold 100 May, 150 July and 300 December. Prudential Securities and Smith Barney were among the fund sellers late, traders said.</p>
<p>Soymeal volume was estimated by CBOT at 35,000 lots, compared with Tuesday's actual volume of 22,002 lots. Soyoil volume was estimated at 23,000 lots, against Tuesday's 22,138 lots.</p>
