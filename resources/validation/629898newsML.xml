<p>Goalkeepers:</p>
<p>Angelo Peruzzi (Juventus) age 27, 16 caps. First choice goalkeeper, key man in helping Juventus win title this season and in European Cup campaign. Former under-21 captain, was suspended for a year in 1990 after he and Roma team mate Andrea Carnevale tested positive for amphetamines.</p>

Had earlier become the first 'keeper in the history of the World Cup finals to be sent off (against Norway). Has not played international soccer for two years but on better form than previous second choice Francesco Toldo of Fiorentina.</p>
<p>Defenders:</p>
<p>Ciro Ferrara (Juventus) 30, 40. Served with Diego Maradona in great Napoli team before joining Juve in 1994. One of the pillars of the Juventus defence and has the experience and maturity to guide the others.</p>
<p>Alessandro Costacurta (Milan) 31, 45. A regular under former coach Arrigo Sacchi and present trainer Cesare Maldini. Has been in AC Milan side for a decade. Suffered rare misfortune of missing both 1994 European Cup final and World Cup final due to suspension.</p>

<p>Christian Panucci (Real Madrid) 23, 5. Signed by Real Madrid from AC Milan for $5.34 million in December last year. Slotted straight into the Real line-up since making his debut on the right of defence. Dangerous at corners.</p>
<p>Alessandro Nesta (Lazio) 21, 3. A surprise last-minute substitute for injured veteran Ferrara, Nesta won his first cap in the European Championship last year. Competent in all defensive roles and known as a team player.</p>
<p>Stefano Torrisi (Bologna) 26, 0. A defender at Bologna, Torrisi is one of three new faces in the squad. Has played for Italy at youth level.</p>
<p>Midfielders:</p>
<p>Angelo Di Livio (Juventus) 30, 14. Late starter in international terms. Caught Sacchi's eye in title-winning Juventus team in 1995 after being a regular with Roma and is now a first-team stalwart.</p>
<p>Demetrio Albertini (Milan) 25, 44. Strong tackler whose main role is to win ball for more creative men around him. Made Italy debut at age of 20 and a regular since. Packs a powerful shot and one of best midfielders in Europe. Penalty-taker for club Milan. Committed Catholic whose brother is a priest.</p>
<p>Roberto Di Matteo (Chelsea) 27, 23. Quiet player who prefers defensive covering role but recently scored one of the quickest goals in English F.A. Cup history, helping Chelsea to victory. Born in Switzerland but turned down offers to play for Swiss team in favour of Italy.</p>
<p>Dino Baggio (Parma) 25, 38. Tall, slightly ungainly figure, no relation to namesake Roberto. His strengths are mainly defensive but has scored important goals, including the one which gave Italy vital 1-0 win over Portugal in their last qualifier for 1994 World Cup.</p>
<p>Alessandro Del Piero (Juventus) 22, 12. The &quot;boy wonder&quot; of Italian soccer, representing country at under-21 and senior level last season. Out since February with a thigh strain but scored in the 1997 European Cup final after coming on as substitute.</p>
<p>Diego Fuser (Lazio) 28, 12. Versatile midfielder who switches between defence and attack.</p>
<p>Giampiero Maini (Vicenza) 25, 0. A goalscorer in his club's historic Italian Cup win against Napoli last Thursday, earned a first call-up and the first for a Vicenza player since Paolo Rossi 18 years ago.</p>
<p>Eusebio Di Francesco (Piacenza) 27, 0. A surprise squad member who joined Piacenza in 1995. The club have struggled in the past two years to stay in serie A. The first Piacenza player to be called up by Italy, he is set to join Roma next season.</p>
<p>Forwards:</p>
<p>Christian Vieri (Juventus) 23, 2. Italian who learned his football in Australia before playing for Venice and Atalanta. Speaks fluent English. Bought by Juventus last year in close season to replace Gianluca Vialli. Has the physique but not yet the finesse.</p>
<p>Filippo Inzaghi (Atalanta) 23, 0. Italy's leading league goalscorer with 22 netted this season. He has been called up for the previous two World Cup qualifiers but is still waiting for his senior international baptism.</p>
<p>Pierluigi Casiraghi (Lazio) 28, 39. Powerful centre-forward, strong in the air, nicknamed &quot;Little Bison&quot;. Serious, studious type who might have been a lawyer had he not become a professional footballer at the age of 16. Has been injured this season but helped Lazio qualify for Europe. Has scored 11 goals for Italy.</p>
<p>Gianfranco Zola (Chelsea) 30, 31. Diminutive Sardinian playmaker who has scored 10 goals for Italy. A key attacker who was voted player of the year in a hugely successful first season in England. Inherited Diego Maradona's number 10 slot while at Napoli.</p>
<p>Enrico Chiesa (Parma) 26, 5. A natural goalscorer, has helped Parma chase Juve at the top of serie A this season. Would have been considered a first team certainty last year but has been sidelined of late in favour of Vieri.</p>
