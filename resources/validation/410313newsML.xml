<p>Two Colombian marines were killed and one was wounded on Friday in an attack by suspected leftist guerrillas in central Bogota, authorities said.</p>
<p>Police said the attack occurred at 6:17 a.m. (1117 GMT) outside a building housing a recruitment centre for the Colombian Navy.</p>
<p>Two men and a woman attacked the marines, who were on sentry duty outside the building in the Teusaquillo district, with bursts of automatic gunfire, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said.</p>
<p>One of the victims was killed instantly and the other died shortly afterwards at a local hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;It was militias,&quot; the spokesman said, referring to urban commandos belonging to one of the two leading guerrilla groups operating across Colombia.</p>
<p>He said the attack may have been in reprisal for the killing of four Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels on Thursday evening during a shootout in the town of Sibate, 20 miles (32 km) outside the capital.</p>
<p>Military officials blame the FARC, Colombia's largest and oldest guerrilla group, for a powerful bomb that exploded on Thursday morning in a town in Colombia's notoriously violent northwest banana-growing region of Uraba that killed at least 10 people and left nearly 50 injured.</p>
