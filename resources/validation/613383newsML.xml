<p>Canadian spot natural gas prices on Monday held steady from last week in trade kept mostly quiet by the U.S. Memorial Day holiday, traders said.</p>
<p>Spot gas at the AECO storage hub in Alberta was quoted at C$1.69 per gigajoule, up about two cents from Friday, but down three cents from deals done over the weekend. June AECO was discussed at C$1.70 per GJ, unchanged from Friday.</p>
<p>NOVA Gas Transmission was cutting transport on its Edson mainline in northwestern Alberta by a total of 200 million cubic feet per day in preperation for scheduled maintenenace set to start on Tuesday, a NGTL spokesman said.  </p>
<p>But a Calgary-based marketer said the cut would have little price impact because maintenance was already being done at the Alberta-British Columbia border point in the southwest and McNiell into the Foothills pipeline in the southeast.</p>
<p>The ABC and McNiell maintenance had been backing interruptible gas volumes into Alberta.</p>
<p>&quot;That makes it a non-event,&quot; the marketer said.</p>
<p>At the borders, gas at Niagara was pegged at US$2.45/2.50 per million British thermal units, based on where the market and NYMEX futures prices settled on Friday, a trader of eastern Canadian gas said.</p>
<p>That would be up about five cents over the weekend, although no spot trades were reported early on Monday.</p>
<p>In the west, gas for export at Sumas, Washington was talked at about US$1.35 per mmBtu, about on par with Friday. ((Reuters Calgary Bureau (403) 531-1624))</p>
