<p>Britain and Norway expect to resolve a disagreement over the North Sea Frigg gas pipeline in a matter of weeks, not months, the Department of Trade and Industry said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we are quite close to reaching a pragmatic arrangement with the Norwegian government which will again allow capacity in the Frigg pipeline to be used to the full,&quot; the head of the DTI's oil and gas division John Mitchell said.</p>
<p>&quot;The energy ministers made it quite clear that there is virtually an agreement on the Frigg system,&quot; Claire Spottiswoode, director general of gas supply at regulator Ofgas also said today.</p>
<p>An agreement would allow Norway to export gas through spare capacity in the Frigg pipeline system to Britain, landing at St Fergus in Scotland.</p>
<p>Julian Kennedy, gas analyst at consultant Wood Mackenzie, said an agreement on the long-running pipeline dispute could benefit both Britain and Norway.</p>
<p>&quot;It helps Britain's case for pushing gas deregulation,&quot; he said. &quot;Instead of just exporting, it also gives Britain the potential to say that it's also importing gas from Norway.&quot;</p>
<p>Britain expects to become a major net exporter of gas from October next year, when the Interconnector, a subsea pipeline connecting Bacton in Norfolk with Zeebrugge in Belgium, comes onstream.</p>
<p>Ofgas's Spottiswoode said on Thursday that both Ofgas and the DTI are putting pressure on the Europen Union to speed up market deregulation.</p>
<p>Kennedy warned that bringing Norwegian gas through the Frigg line could lead to bottlenecks, as there are several lines landing at St Fergus bringing large volumes of gas ashore. But there are potential pipeline constraints on moving the gas south into consumer markets in England, and importing new supplies could make this critical.</p>
<p>British and Norwegian energy officials have met regularly to try to resolve the long-standing dispute over the North Sea gas pipeline, which straddles their territorial waters.</p>
<p>Until now, Britain has blocked Norway from using a pipeline from Frigg to bring gas from other fields to sell into Britain. Under an inter-governmental treaty signed in 1976, Norway is only allowed to deliver gas produced at Frigg or one of its satellites until Frigg is fully depleted. But Frigg output has been falling since 1992 so Norway wants to be able to use the spare capacity on the pipeline to deliver gas from other fields.</p>
