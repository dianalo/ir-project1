<p>Chrysler Corp said Thursday it will expand its presence in South Korea by establishing Chrysler Korea Sales Ltd (CKSL) as a wholly owned subsidiary for importation and distribution.</p>
<p>CKSL, based in Seoul, will be responsible for appointing dealers, setting up a sales and service infrastructure, and coordinating marketing activities, Chrysler said in a statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;Chrysler made the decision to take over its distribution to get closer to the market and our consumers and to respond quickly to changing market conditions,&quot; said Ronald Gardhouse, general manager for Asia Pacific operations, in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The recent reduction of import duties and taxes is an important first step to make the Korean market more attractive and viable for importers like Chrysler,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chrysler was previously represented by Woosung Department Store, one of 17 companies in the Woosung Group, a South Korean conglomerate. Since its appointment in 1992, Woosung developed a network of 22 dealers throughout South Korea.  </p>
<p>Year-to-date, Chrysler has sold more than 1,500 units in South Korea with a calendar year target of 2,500 vehicles. Chrysler sold 1,119 units in 1995.</p>
<p>CKSL expects to sell around 4,000 units in 1997.</p>
<p>CKSL will absorb some of Woosung's existing dealers as well as appoint new main dealers. In addition, CKSL plans to expand and improve the current after-sales network.</p>
<p>Sales of existing inventory will begin in October and imports of 1997 model year vehicles will start in December.</p>
<p>Chrysler currently sells in South Korea three Jeep models -- Wrangler, Cherokee and Grand Cherokee -- and the Chrysler Caravan, Grand Caravan, Vision, Stratus and Neon passenger vehicles.</p>
<p>Separately, Chrysler also said it opened a Southeast Asian regional headquarters in Singapore which will be responsible for business including Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore.</p>
