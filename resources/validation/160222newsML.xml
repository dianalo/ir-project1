<p>Germany's ongoing debate over the safety of nuclear power intensified on Friday when the Hesse environment minister said she planned to withdraw the operating licence for Germany's oldest nuclear plant at Biblis.</p>
<p>Margarethe Nimsch, of the Green Party, said she would withdraw the operating licence for Biblis A, which is owned by the huge German power company RWE Energie AG, due to saftey questions at the plant.</p>
<p>Nimsch said she had sent a 55-page letter to German federal environment minister Angela Merkel detailing the plant's technical security and legal status and announced a draft withdrawal of the its operating licence, first granted in 1975.</p>
<p>&quot;It is no longer just a question of a temporary closure while the plant is upgraded. It is now a question of withdrawing the operating licence because the plant cannot be upgraded in any reasonable timeframe,&quot; Nimsch said.</p>
<p>The move marks the first time in German history that a nuclear power plant's operating licence has been withdrawn.</p>
<p>RWE Energie, a unit of the utility giant RWE, said in a statement that the state's plan was further evidence of the Hessian nuclear authority's duplicity.</p>
<p>&quot;On the one hand, the so-called security lapses at the plant are constantly denounced while on the other hand, state officials have blocked every attempt to improve the security at Block A of the plant,&quot; the group said.</p>
<p>Nimsch said both the present environment authorities and those of previous governments have called for the construction of an emergency shut-down facility for the reactor.</p>
<p>However, a RWE report said the facility's construction was impossible because it could endanger a nearby reactor's ability to withstand earthquakes.</p>
<p>Nimsch did not specify when the the operating licence would be withdrawn. &quot;That could take another two months,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>In October, a Frankfurt court refused damages to RWE, who had sued for 1.8 million marks in damages after a three-day temporary closure of the plant.</p>
