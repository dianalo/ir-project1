<p>After months of putting a bright face on increasingly ugly trade numbers, the Brazilian government has officially acknowledged its concern over trade by slapping on tougher import financing rules, economists said.</p>
<p>Beginning April 1, the Central Bank will require importers with short-term financing to pay for their foreign currency the day they pick up their merchandise from customs.  </p>
<p>One main goal of the measure, officials said, is to eliminate arbitrage opportunities enjoyed by importers, who may now park revenue in reais in high-yielding domestic funds for the duration of their financing contract.</p>
<p>Economists said it was too early to say how effective the measure would be. But most agreed it alone would not be enough to resolve Brazil's mammoth trade gap, which hit $5.5 billion in 1996 and is growing by about $1.0 billion a month.</p>
<p>More important, they said, was that a consensus has formed among economic policy-makers that tougher action against the growing trade gap was necessary.  </p>
<p>Just last week, Central Bank International Affairs Director Gustavo Franco -- who has confidently shrugged off the worsening trade picture as a necessary consequence of economic opening -- said he would not be worried if Brazil's trade gap swelled to $15 billion this year.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we can say that this 'so what' faction lost out to the pro-active group, which is represented by (Economic Policy Secretary) Jose Roberto Mendonca de Barros,&quot; said Mauro Schneider, chief economist at ING Bank in Brazil.  </p>
<p>Most analysts saw the move as an important first step in addressing the deteriorating trade picture. They said the opportunity to arbitrage in local markets was a huge incentive for importers using short-term financing of up to 360 days, which covers some 65 percent of Brazil's imports.</p>
<p>The arbitrage gains, they said, could be used to cushion any losses if the imported goods weren't quickly sold. Without that padding, importers need to be clearer on securing buyers for imports.  </p>
<p>But some warned that it could lead to higher prices for imported goods, which could have an inflationary effect. Big importers, due to their size, are better able to get longer term financing, should they need it.</p>
<p>&quot;It creates a monopoly of big importers, who will determine prices and we will pay for it,&quot; said former Central Bank official Alcindo Ferreira, now a consultant at Consultores Associados.  </p>
<p>Economists said they expected additional measures to follow, noting that the strong real currency, a continued commitment to economic opening, high import demand and weak export performance would continue to pressure trade accounts.</p>
<p>Whereas the new measure only restricts credit on imported consumer goods, the government could later slap credit restrictions on the entire economy.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they are avoiding this now and focusing on imports because there are still signs that the economy is not growing too fast in many sectors. But that will probably change,&quot; said an economist at a large international bank who requested anonymity.</p>
<p>The government was also expected to create new export incentives.</p>
