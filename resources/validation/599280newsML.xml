<p>European Union farm ministers gather for three days of informal talks in the southern Dutch town of Middelburg next week with reform of the bloc's milk policy top of the agenda.</p>
<p>The meeting, from May 25 to 27, is informal in that no firm decisions will be taken, but it will act as a sounding board for member states' divergent views on how to amend the milk regime, which supports European prices and sets national output quotas.</p>
<p>It will also give Britain's Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham his first taste of EU negotiations amid signs the new Labour government is taking a more constructive stance towards Brussels than the former Conservative administration.</p>
<p>The Netherlands holds the EU Presidency until end-June and Britain takes up the reins from Luxembourg in January 1998.</p>
<p>Reform of the European dairy sector, with its subsidised prices and set national quotas, has long been mooted. New GATT free trade rules and the potential enlargement of the bloc to embrace eastern Europe have heightened the pressure for change.</p>
<p>Critics argue the system has gone sour -- effectively giving the European Commission control over supply and thus the ability to keep prices at levels which suit the powerful EU farm lobby more than the consumer.</p>
<p>The Dutch government, known to attach a high priority to reform of the sector, is keeping its cards close to its chest and has not released details of any proposals.</p>
<p>&quot;(Farm) Minister (Jozias) Van Aartsen will just sound out the views of other European states. He won't present a complete plan to the meeting,&quot; a farm ministry spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Under the present system, a production quota is allocated to each member state and the Commission is empowered to impose fines, the so-called superlevies, on countries that exceed them.</p>
<p>This agreed quota scheme is due to expire in 2000.</p>
<p>The Dutch annual quota for example is set at near 11 billion litres of milk, of which 25 percent is consumed domestically, 25 percent exported to world markets and 50 percent to other EU states. It is a system the dairy industry says has worked well.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not think the levy system has had a bad influence. The Dutch dairy industry, and the farmer must be guaranteed a good income,&quot; Tim Brouwers, spokesman for the Dutch dairy industry assocition (NZO), told Reuters.</p>
<p>But some countries are unhappy with their allocation and have paid the penalty for over-stepping the mark.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Commission decided to block agricultural advance payments worth just over 240 million Ecus to Italy, Spain and Greece for non-payment of superlevies imposed for over-shooting dairy quotas in the 1995/96 season.</p>
<p>Farmers in Italy blockaded roads and airports in the north of the country in protest at the fines -- forcing the government to pass a package of emergency aid measures for the sector. The government also asked the Commission to increase its quota, saying the country &quot;did not produce enough milk for itself&quot;.</p>
<p>The initial debate on reform options focused on building a two-tier system, which some EU members still favour. It relies on an &quot;A&quot; national quota, which would receive full subsidies and a &quot;B&quot; quota for non-subsidised exports to world markets.</p>
<p>However, this original plan is losing support with some saying it would be incompatible with World Trade Organisation rules and would be difficult to enforce in what is a highly diverse industry right across the EU's 15 members.</p>
<p>The British, among others, are believed to favour a more market-orientated approach, scrapping national quotas altogether providing farmers are adequately compensated.</p>
<p>The Dutch will have to steer a path between these two views and may opt for the pragmatic, duel quota/price approach, where production limits are maintained but prices reduced.</p>
