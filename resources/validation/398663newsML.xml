<p>The Cahners Business Confidence Index (CBCI) rose to 67.4 in February from 66.6 the month before, Cahners Economics said.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest Cahners survey of business confidence shows the business community feeling very good about current economic conditions, with little concern that the bubble is about to burst,&quot; said Cahners economist Daryl Delano, who prepared the report.</p>
<p>Six of the seven CBCI components increased between January and February, the report said. Product introduction rose most strongly in February, climbing 2.9 points to stand at 74.8.  </p>
<p>The research and development index turned in the second-best performance, rising to 67.4 from 64.7 the month before.</p>
<p>&quot;(This) indicates that manufacturers are confident enough about the underpinnings of the economic expansion to step up their investment in new product development,&quot; Delano said.</p>
<p>Additionally employment enjoyed a 1.5-point gain in February. Marketing spending rose 0.5 points, production sales advanced 0.4 points and inventories increased 0.1 points. Capital spending, however, fell 2.5 points to stand at 61.3.</p>
<p>Regionally, confidence was strongest in the South, up 2.0 points in February. The index was also up 1.1 points in the West and 0.9 points in the Midwest. But the Northeast fell 0.7 points.</p>
<p>The Cahners index is based on a monthly survey of 400 senior and mid-level manufacturing executives in cyclically sensitive industries, such as electronics and computers, construction, consumer goods and general manufacturing, the report said.</p>
