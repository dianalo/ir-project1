<p>THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW</p>

<p>The Federal Government has rejected a push by the States to give the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General the right to recommend one name to the Federal Government for any High Court vacancy. Currently, High Court appointments are entirely a Commonweath responsibility but Federal Attorney-General Daryl Williams said this system had become perfunctory, and he intended to consult far more widely.

<p>WA, NT, Qld, SA, farmers and miners have rejected Prime Minister John Howard's proposal to continue giving Aboriginal native title holders on pastoral leases a &quot;right to negotiate&quot; over future mining, tourism and other developments on farms.

<p>THE AUSTRALIAN</p>
<p>As a company of troops from the Townsville-based 3rd Brigade was on standby yesterday for immediate deployment to Papua New Guinea, senior sources rejected the possibility of Australian troops being used to intercede in the political standoff, saying they will only be used to evacuate foreign citizens in the event of bloodshed on the streets.

<p>THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD</p>
<p>As Brigadier-General Jerry Singirok said yesterday Australian troops would not be needed to restore order in Papua New Guinea, the country's Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan last night refused to bow to Singirok's demands and resign over his controversial dcision to engage foreign mercenaries on Bougainville, saying if the people did not want him, they could vote him out of office.

<p>Well-known Australian author Archie Weller, who is described on the cover of his latest work, Going Home as &quot;a pioneering Aboriginal writer&quot;, has revealed that despite for the past 20 years he has been funded, published and billed as an Aborigine, his attempts to prove his indigenous descent have failed.

<p>In comments which come as sacked armed forces commander Brigadier-General Jerry Singirok warned that Australia must be careful with its response to security in Papua New Guinea, the country's Prime Minister, Sir Julius Chan refused last night to resign ovr his Government's hiring of mercenaries on Bougainville, appealing for people to respect the country's Constitution and keep him in power.

<p>Under the Federal Government's response to the High Court's controversial Wik decision - outlined to State Premiers last Friday - native title would be wiped out in all but name, there would be a massive expansion in tax breaks for pastoralists and limits to native title claims to land where Aborigines are already living.
