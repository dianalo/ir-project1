<p>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed efforts to break a deadlock in talks on a long-overdue Israeli troop redeployment from parts of the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators meeting for the second day at Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba said U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross had detailed points of understandings which could become the basis for a Hebron deal.</p>
<p>They said the draft would be explored in more detail after Ross returned from meetings with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Earlier, a senior Israeli official said the sides broke into committees to discuss outstanding issues left over from a 1995 interim Israeli-PLO peace accord, foremost of which is the Hebron redeployment.</p>
<p>&quot;Israelis want to focus on Hebron and the Palestinians want to focus on other outstanding issues. It will be clear later whether they agree on this,&quot; the Israeli official said.</p>
<p>He said Israeli negotiators had come with proposals on how to break an impasse over the partial troop withdrawal from the West Bank town.</p>
<p>Arafat on Wednesday blasted an Israeli proposal on Hebron which he said would, among other things, divide the town into Jewish and Arab sections and grant Israeli troops the right of hot pursuit into Palestinian areas.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a dangerous operation. It shows Israel's aggressive intentions in Hebron and shows complete and abhorrent racism,&quot; Arafat said in Cairo.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's aide David Bar-Illan said Arafat's claims were a &quot;big lie&quot;.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who on Wednesday had appealed for goodwill during negotiations, took a subtle swipe at Arafat for his comments.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now engaged in very difficult and sensitive... negotiations which can spell not only our commitment to pursuing the peace process, but the seriousness and honesty and sincerity of our partners,&quot; Netanyahu said at an address to Jewish fundraisers.</p>
<p>Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the PLO sought implementation of signed deals and not further proposals.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not listen to any proposal that does not consist of mechanisms of implementing the agreement,&quot; Asfour said.</p>
<p>Palestinians want Netanyahu to honour a commitment made by Israel's previous government to hand over parts of Hebron to PLO authority. Netanyahu, elected in May, wants to modify the agreement to safeguard 400 Jewish settlers who live in heavily armed compounds amidst 100,000 Arabs in Hebron's centre.</p>
<p>Ross, in self-ruled Gaza to coordinate with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on the talks, told reporters he felt the Taba talks were launched last night on the right foot.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel both sides are genuinely and honestly trying to find ways to overcome differences,&quot; Ross said in Gaza after he met Arafat in Gaza.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we are all determined to do all we can to produce results as soon as possible,&quot; Ross said. Arafat, smiling widely, praised Ross for his mediation.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't forget he worked through all the night,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>Ross was due to meet Netanyahu later on Thursday.</p>
