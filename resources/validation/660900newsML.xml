<p>A year after history's costliest rogue trader scandal hit Sumitomo Corp of Japan with $2.6 billion of losses, fraud investigators on three continents rake the embers.</p>
<p>But if they had suspected any web of malpractice at the heart of the opaque world trade in metals, only one person faces a court.</p>
<p>Yasuo Hamanaka, the quiet 49-year-old, grey-haired policeman's son, family man and strap hanger on the Tokyo commuter train, was for a decade mastermind of the multi-trillion-dollar copper derivatives trade based on the London Metal Exchange (LME).</p>
<p>His trial continues in the Tokyo District Court where he has pleaded guilty to charges of fraud and forgery.</p>
<p>But he denies manipulating the copper market while his lawyers seek leniency for him -- he faces up to 15 years in jail -- saying that lax Sumitomo supervision was partly to blame for its huge loss.</p>
<p>Fraud inquiries continue, coordinated across Asia, Britain, where documents were seized in police raids, and the Americas, if only to allay concerns that Hamanaka may not have acted alone.</p>
<p>&quot;The SFO (Serious Fraud Office) and the City of London police are continuing their investigations...This is a large investigation involving considerable liaison with overseas jurisdictions,&quot; said SFO spokeswoman Ceinwen Jones.</p>
<p>COMPLEX CASE</p>
<p>Jones said that such investigations tended to be &quot;document-based&quot; so the main challenge is to analyse usually huge amounts of complex data.</p>
<p>&quot;Complex investigations take a long time and this one is a particularly good example of how overseas jurisdictions need to work together in cases of alleged fraud,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Michael Levi, professor of Criminology at the University of Wales at Cardiff, said that investigators also &quot;probably want to hear Hamanaka's full story in the Japanese court. It's a question of what they can use and whether they can use him as a credible witness...</p>
<p>&quot;These big messy corporate cases always take a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>LONDON EXCHANGE MAKES REFORM</p>
<p>Hamanaka was unmasked, say fellow traders, when the long arm of U.S. market regulators reached out and tapped Sumitomo on the shoulder to alert it to its exposed position in copper.</p>
<p>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Corporation was also concerned about the efficacy of the regulatory regime in place on the London Metal Exchange (LME).</p>
<p>One upshot was an inquiry by the British regulator, the Securities and Investment Board, that sought changes to make the market more transparent.</p>
<p>LME chief executive David King says independent members have been named to the board and will have more supervisory power.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has come through in good shape,&quot; King said in an interview, adding that when all reforms are implemented, the LME &quot;will be a more attractive place to do business&quot;.</p>
<p>LME turnover overall is up, but volume in copper is down.</p>
<p>&quot;Copper turnover has still not recovered from the loss of confidence surrounding last year's Hamanaka debacle...&quot; says analyst Nick Moore of Flemings Research.</p>
<p>Since the scandal broke, two of what were 17 LME ring dealing members have relinquished their seats on the floor -- the latest being Deutsche Morgan Grenfell on Wednesday.</p>
<p>COPPER PRICES SURPRISINGLY RESILIENT</p>
<p>The copper price itself has shown remarkable resilience, buoyed by low stocks and supply hiccups since it nosedived when Hamanaka, who was sitting on a huge &quot;long&quot; position, lost his job and Sumitomo had to unwind it.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a phenomenal performance. All credit to the copper price that it's clawed back to where it started,&quot; said analyst Robin Bhar of brokers Brandeis.</p>
<p>Copper is back up around $2,600 per tonne -- actually firmer than on June 13, 1996, when Sumitomo Corp confirmed rumours of huge losses.</p>
<p>It is not far from the cyclical peak of May 1996 at $2,715 just before rumours that Hamanaka was in trouble entered the market and way up from $1,745 to which it fell last June as these were confirmed.</p>
<p>&quot;The fundamentals have been very supportive. Demand, especially in the U.S. market, has been stronger than people expected,&quot; said Angus Macmillian of Billiton. &quot;Also production has not increased as fast as people believed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's happening now, a year later, is some people are questioning whether Hamanaka actually did have such influence on the market that everyone pointed to,&quot; adds Bhar at Brandeis.</p>
<p>AT SUMITOMO ITSELF, BUSINESS AS USUAL</p>
<p>At Sumitomo itself, albeit with a damaged corporate image, it is more or less business as usual. The trading house made its first annual loss since it was founded in 1919 and may cut the staff summer bonus.</p>
<p>&quot;We ran into the red in the last business year for the first time and our copper sales plunged, but the other departments are doing well and there's no serious impact now,&quot; said a spokesman.</p>
