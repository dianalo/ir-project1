<p>As Katarina Witt climbed to the top of the podium year after year, Mandy Woetzel sat at home watching, determined one day to do the same.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night the 23-year-old German finally achieved what she saw Witt do so often on television, scaling the rostrum as a world champion.</p>
<p>She and Ingo Steuer captured the world pairs title after being agonisingly close as runners-up twice before.</p>
<p>Witt, also from the former East Germany, won four world and two Olympic singles titles from 1984 -- when Woetzel was only 10 -- to 1988 to fire the dreams of young girls like Woetzel at home.</p>
<p>&quot;I watched her and I thought, 'I want to be there, on the top'. Now I am on the top,&quot; she said after her triumph.</p>
<p>&quot;I have reached the aim of my life. This was the big goal for me.&quot;</p>
<p>She and Steuer, who were European champions in 1995, had made the world title their major target after finishing second in 1993 and again last year.</p>
<p>There was more heartbreak when they had to withdraw from the 1994 Olympics in Norway after Woetzel fell from Steuer's grip during their free programme and crashed to the ice on her chin.</p>
<p>She was briefly unconscious and Steuer carried her limp and bleeding in his arms from the ice.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night Woetzel could not master the troublesome double axel jump, falling in what was to be their only mistake.</p>
<p>&quot;I am almost glad I fell because sometimes when you make a big mistake it is easier to dig in for the rest of the programme than when you make a small mistake and it preys on your mind,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Next year it will be better,&quot; she said of the axel, referring to next year's Olympics in Nagano, Japan.</p>
<p>There was nothing else wrong in their high quality programme full of difficult throws, side-by-side jumps and spins as they completed the overthrow of the reigning champions, Russians Marina Eltsova and Andrei Bushkov.</p>
<p>When Bushkov crashed on his opening jump, a triple toe loop, the Germans were safe if they made no more than one mistake.</p>
<p>Russians Artur Dmitriev, the former world, Olympic and European champion, and Oksana Kazakova were too far back in sixth place after the short programme to have a realistic shot at the gold medals.</p>
<p>Their chances fizzled completely when for the second night in succession he scaled his opening triple toe loop jump down to a double.</p>
<p>&quot;I never missed that jump with Natalia (Mishkutienok, his former partner),&quot; he said, then looked embarrassed as he realised he seemed to be blaming Kazakova.</p>
<p>&quot;It was my mistake, completely,&quot; he added quickly. &quot;It was a big shock for me.&quot;</p>
<p>Yet he and Kazakova, who were third, appear to have jelled perfectly after coming together in 1995 and winning the European title against expectations last year.</p>
<p>Great artist though he still is, however, Dmitriev has gained weight and coach Tamara Moskvina is sure to insist he sheds it before next year's Olympics.</p>
<p>Last year's bronze medallists, Americans Jenni Meno and Todd Sand, gave an uninspired display and dropped to fifth behind team mates Kyoko Ina and Jason Dungjen.</p>
<p>With the others making mistakes, the way was clear for last pair Elena Berezhnaia and Anton Sikharulidze to advance from third place.</p>
<p>But disaster overtook the young Russians and each fell twice as they plunged to ninth.</p>
