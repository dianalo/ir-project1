<p>University research in Britain must be more in tune with industry's needs if the country is to continue to lure inward investment and sustain competitiveness, CBI president Sir Colin Marshall said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;If scientific education and the orientation of the long-term strategic research base is not aligned to the needs of industry, it's very difficult to see how Britain can maintain, let alone enhance, its competitiveness,&quot; Marshall told the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee Anuual Luncheon.</p>
<p>He said it was vital the government continued its investment in science and engineering research, at least at the current level of six billion stg per year.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is that the development and application of technology along with a well trained and highly educated workforce, is a significant determinant of competitive advantage,&quot; Marshall added.</p>
<p>He said Britain's science base played a major role in attracting inward investment into the country.</p>
<p>&quot;So far, overseas companies are investing in Britain because of the excellence of our science base -- and it's consequently essential to maintain its quality.&quot;</p>
