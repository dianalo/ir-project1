<title>UK: Strong sterling pounds UK grain markets.</title>
<headline>Strong sterling pounds UK grain markets.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-18</dateline>

<p>A strong sterling hammered the UK physical grain and futures markets on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some dissatisfaction with Thursday's tender result but sterling has been the dominant factor during the day,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>On Friday the pound touched $1.5930, its highest level since early October last year.</p>
<p>Traders said a possible revaluation of the green pound was also on the cards which would hit intervention prices.</p>
<p>Wheat futures closed one to 1.50 stg down after being as much as 1.80 stg below Thursday's close at one stage. Turnover was 1,214 lots.</p>
<p>Barley finished 1.75 to one stg down after trading 72 lots.</p>
<p>In Amsterdam the milling wheat futures market closed unchanged.</p>
<p>Active trading was reported on the UK delivered market with a higher tonnage changing hands.</p>
<p>&quot;There is blood running in the gutters,&quot; said a one trader.</p>
<p>Feed wheat was trading as low as 99 stg in some areas for November while in East Anglia it fetched 100 stg.</p>
<p>Lowest reported price was 97 stg paid for feed wheat in the Shropshire/Cheshire area for spot.</p>
<p>&quot;People are saying the farmers are not selling, but the co-ops do seem to be involved,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Traders on the fob sector said the market appeared to be stuck.</p>
<p>&quot;Fob sellers haven't been following the the futures and are refusing to move from Thursday's levels. But I don't read anything significant into this. Only that they may feel they had enough for this week and want to start afresh next week,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices have not really moved during the day, but if futures stay down the fob market will creak on Monday,&quot; said another.</p>
