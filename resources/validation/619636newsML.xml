<p>South Africa's punitively high interest rates are starting to take their toll on the quality of loans on the books of the country's banks, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The issue was highlighted this week by the 230 million rand credit owed by ailing Pepsi bottler New Age Beverages to Standard Bank.</p>
<p>Mark Young, banking analyst at credit rating agency IBCA, says Standard -- left nursing potentially its biggest ever loss -- is not alone.</p>
<p>&quot;Credit quality is definitely under pressure. The banks are exposed to growing credit risk, not only the consumer side but also on the corporate side,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The country's leading banks have reported a sharp increase in provisions for bad debts recently, underlining concerns about credit quality.</p>
<p>Amalgamated Banks of South Africa Ltd on Monday announced it had increased provisions for bad and doubtful debts by 42 percent in the year to end-March.</p>
<p>That followed the lead set earlier this month by First National Bank Holdings Ltd which lifted provisions 64 percent in the half year to end-March and Nedcor Ltd which lifted half-year provisions by 26 percent.</p>
<p>FNB Managing Director Viv Bartlett said at the time of the results that the hike in provisions was to be expected given the credit squeeze now confronting consumers.</p>
<p>According to the Reserve Bank, average household debt has now reached two-thirds of disposable income, a level well above the international norm.</p>
<p>Most economists started the year expecting at least two interest rates cuts this year.</p>
<p>But much of the optimism has since evaporated with monetary growth still remaining too high for the liking of central bank governor Chris Stals, offering little immediate relief for borrowers or their bankers.</p>
<p>Alan McConnochie, banking analyst at BOE NatWest, said banks were feeling the pinch, although there was no cause for general alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;They are fairly well provided for but whereas they were pretty comfortable a year ago, now the write-offs are starting to hurt,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;While interest rates stay high there is a lot of pain being taken. There is no real cause for alarm but it is biting.&quot;</p>
<p>South Africa's official Bank rate is currently set at 17 percent while commercial banks' prime lending rate is 20.25 percent, a real interest rate of over 10 percent after allowing for consumer price inflation which stood at 9.9 percent in April.</p>
