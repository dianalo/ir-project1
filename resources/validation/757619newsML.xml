<p>U.S. gasoline differentials were mixed in quiet Friday trade although values may ease in the near future os imports of reformulated gasoline and MTBE begin to return to normal levels.</p>
<p>Spot differentials in New York Harbor remained stable but firm on the still strong pricing of MTBE and the fact that many players were away at an industry outing, players said.</p>
<p>Midcontinent unleaded gasoline differentials, meanwhile, slid on news that a Kansas refinery at partial production will return to full steam by next week.</p>
<p>NEW YORK HARBOR</p>
<p>Reformulated and high octane gasoline grades remained at firmer levels Friday morning as the price of blending component MTBE remained at the high 102.00 cents level.</p>
<p>Differentials for M2-grade 87-octane unleaded were pegged a tad stronger at 4.00 cents to 4.25 cents a gallon below August NYMEX futures. Any months were talked weaker by 0.10 cent at 4.50/4.25 cents below the print.</p>
<p>Differentials, however, may ease late this August amid news that about one million barrels of reformulated gasoline were heading for the Harbor and the U.S. Gulf hubs.</p>
<p>The shipments, fixed this morning, are on top of more than 1.5 million barrels of gasoline scheduled earlier this week and should help return imports to traditional levels.</p>
<p>In addition, ARCO Chemical fixed 270,000 barrels of MTBE imports from its Rotterdam and Fos Su Mer plants for U.S markets, according to shippers. ARCO usually imports material from its European facilities but had stopped shipments during Rotterdam's recent six-week turnaround.</p>
<p>The MTBE imports are expected to fill what has been a shallow pool of supply and help ease values.</p>
<p>Few players in the Harbor as well the Gulf were in the office Friday because of BP oil industry golf outing in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
<p>U.S. GULF</p>
<p>Meanwhile, M1-grade regular conventional differentials for the front 22nd cycle jumped about 0.75 cent to sit near 0.50 cent below the September NYMEX. Deals were done at a penny early in the day, but moved up to 0.50 under by midday.</p>
<p>The A1-grade reformulated 93-octane stayed stable at even to 0.50 cent over the print, though few players appeared to be actively selling.</p>
<p>MIDCONTINENT</p>
<p>Group Three unleaded gasoline differentials slipped further on Friday on news this morning that gasoline production at National Cooperative Refinery Association's McPherson, Kansas, plant will return to full steam next week.</p>
<p>The unit had been at partial production levels since Monday following a small fire at a reformer that makes gasoline components. The fire firmed differentials by about a half cent in Group Three, but values began to decline yesterday due to a lack of buying interest.</p>
<p>Parcels for 0.75 cent have been done under August NYMEX futures, about a half cent below Thursday afternoon and more than penny below Monday levels.</p>
<p>Chicago gasoline differentials remained steady at 0.75/1.00 cents a gallon.</p>
