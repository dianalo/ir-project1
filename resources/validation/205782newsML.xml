<p>---PRESS RELEASE------------------------------</p>
<p>CompuServe Global Strategy:  Expand Business-Sector Leadership, Focus On Proven Consumer Segments</p>
<p>'Back-To-Basics' Plan Aimed At Exploiting Established Strengths</p>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 21 /PRNewswire/ -- In conjunction with separately announcing financial results for the company's second fiscal quarter, CompuServe Corp. (Nasdaq: CSRV) today unveiled a &quot;back-to-basics&quot; global strategy aimed at building on its business-sector leadership and focusing on proven consumer segments.</p>
<p>The company said it plans to:</p>
<p>*  By early 1997, formally introduce substantially enhanced offerings to advance its leadership among business, technical and professional users in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>*  Continue focusing on its growing subscriber base in the European consumer sector, where CompuServe enjoys market share and brand leadership.</p>
<p>*  In the United States, continue to offer a distinctive experience to our traditional and loyal base of consumer users in the CompuServe</p>
<p>	 Interactive (CSi) online and Internet service.</p>
<p>*  In the United States, discontinue undifferentiated mass marketing efforts that, with intensified competition, have produced high attrition rates; and withdraw the company's flat-rate, mass market-oriented WOW! consumer service from the market place, effective Jan. 31, 1997.</p>
<p>*  Continue strong support and increased visibility for CompuServe Network Services, which has been growing at more than 30 percent annually and provides outsourced data communications, intranet solutions and applications hosting to an expanding global roster of over 1,000 corporations.</p>
<p>*  Pursue continued growth for the SPRYNET Internet-access service, which is now the third-largest ISP in the United States and recently won PC Magazine's &quot;Editors' Choice&quot; award in its category.</p>
<p>&quot;Through recent intensive analysis and hands-on experience, especially in the U.S. market for online/Internet services, we have learned some encouraging and some sobering lessons,&quot; said Bob Massey, CompuServe President and CEO.  As a result, we will now focus on areas where we have clear competitive advantage and that offer strong potential for growth.&quot;</p>
<p>Global Business-Sector Expansion</p>
<p>In early 1997, CompuServe plans to formally introduce substantially enhanced offerings for business users in the United States and Europe, according to Denny Matteucci, president of interactive services.  &quot;In the U.S., we are on schedule to debut an exciting new premium service, 'CompuServe for Business,' that heavily targets professionals and businesses, especially those with fewer than 100 employees -- the Small Office Home Office, or SoHo, market.  According to industry analyst firm IDC/LINK, there currently are 7 million small businesses in the United States alone, and the number with online/Internet access is projected to increase from 25 percent today to 70 percent by the year 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;Fully 45 percent of our CSi subscriber base today consists of business executives and middle managers, and 35 percent of CSi subscribers have full- or part-time home businesses,&quot; said Matteucci.  &quot;For CompuServe, business, technical and professional users produce higher usage, higher margins and higher loyalty -- they stay with us on average more than twice as long as other subscribers.  Our content and reputation in this sector are unrivaled worldwide.&quot;</p>
<p>An enhanced business menu will be available next month on the flagship CSi service that makes it easier for users to find and use the vast business-related content on the service, he said.  The follow-on CompuServe for Business service is far along in development and will feature expanded content and capabilities, and a separate pricing plan.  CompuServe for Business will be built on the existing CSi service and will exploit the company's recently introduced CompuServe 3.0 software.</p>
<p>In the same early-1997 timeframe, CompuServe plans to introduce enhanced products and services in Europe for the business, technical and professional sector.  &quot;CompuServe is the European market share and mindshare leader in both the business and consumer sectors,&quot; said Jerry Roest, CompuServe's European general manager.  &quot;We have nearly doubled our European subscriber base during the past year to almost one million members.  While we anticipate strong continued growth in the European consumer sector, we expect even more growth in the business-to-business market.&quot;  </p>
<p>A recent survey of European businesses by International Data Group (IDG) revealed that CompuServe has the highest top-of-mind awareness (30 percent) among Internet suppliers in the United Kingdom, followed by Netscape (14 percent) and Microsoft (9 percent).  CompuServe also scored highest in France and Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;CompuServe knows business and has a strong global presence, unlike most competitors who have recently announced plans to target this attractive sector,&quot; Matteucci said.  &quot;One of our biggest advantages -- particularly for demanding business users -- is the proven security and 24-by-7 reliability of CompuServe's global network, which supports all of our divisions and has never gone down since its inception in 1973.  As we move aggressively toward open standards using Microsoft's 'Normandy' architecture, we are committed to advancing this track record.&quot;</p>
<p>Focus On Proven Consumer Segments</p>
<p>Scott Kauffman, CompuServe's vice president, interactive services, said CompuServe will focus on proven segments of the global consumer market.  &quot;That includes our strong and growing consumer membership in Europe and other international geographies.  In the U.S., we will continue providing leading proprietary online content and Internet-access service for CSi traditional and loyal base of users.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Going forward, we will emphasize our inherent strengths,&quot; Kauffman said, &quot;We're going to refocus on our existing leadership among business, professional and technical users, as well as loyal consumers.  These are segments with more stable subscriber bases.  This is where we built our name and reputation, and where we continue to be the undisputed leader.&quot;</p>
<p>CompuServe continues to see its CSi business evolving to a media company model, in which subscriber revenues are supplemented by alternative revenues from advertising and electronic commerce.  &quot;We have been making good progress in the alternative revenue arena and are devoting substantial effort here, but we see this as a multiple-year ramp-up.  Our marketing focus will be able to deliver highly targeted demographics to prospective advertisers and electronic commerce partners.&quot;</p>
<p>WOW! Service Discontinuation</p>
<p>&quot;When we launched our WOW! service earlier this year, we felt it was the right product for the time,&quot; Kauffman said. &quot;Since that time, much has changed in terms of market entrants, pricing and the high cost to compete in the mass consumer market.  We have therefore decided to withdraw our WOW! service from the market place, effective January 31, 1997.  We intend to focus our resources in those sectors where we can profitably expand our business.&quot;</p>
<p>Kauffman stressed that WOW! service will continue through the end of January.  &quot;We are mapping out an orderly transition.  We will also invite WOW! members to join our CSi service.&quot;</p>
