<p>A Sudanese government newspaper said on Monday the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) tortured to death a senior government official it took prisoner when it captured the provincial capital of Rumbek in the south.</p>
<p>Al-Anbaa newspaper said Simon Mabior Malek, whose role as political adviser is equivalent to a minister in the government of Buheyrat state, was taken prisoner in April along with the state's governor and other members of his regional government.</p>
<p>SPLA rebels captured Rumbek, the capital of Buheyrat state, in April. A government-owned newspaper in May acknowledged the town's capture but the Khartoum government has never confirmed SPLA claims that the rebels had seized officials there.</p>
<p>&quot;The political adviser of Buheyrat state died under torture in rebel hands after he was taken prisoner with the governor and the responsible persons in the government of Buheyrat state,&quot; al-Anbaa said.</p>
<p>The paper said Malek, a retired police major general, was &quot;murdered on the personal orders of John Garang&quot; in Tonj, which is also in Buheyrat state and was captured by the SPLA a few days after the fall of Rumbek.</p>
<p>Garang is the head of the SPLA which has been fighting since 1983 for independence or greater autonomy for the Christian and animist south from the Moslem and Arab north.</p>
<p>President Omar Hassan al-Bashir said Malek had sacrificed his life for his country, the official news agency SUNA said.</p>
