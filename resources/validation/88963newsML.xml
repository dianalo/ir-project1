<p>Finnish paper machine maker Valmet Oy said on Tuesday it expected its full-year 1996 profit to improve clearly on 1995 and it pointed to strong orders suggesting good prospects for 1997 as well.</p>
<p>The company gave the profit forecast in conjunction with its eight-month results, which showed January-August profit after financial items surging more than 100 percent to 664 million markka ($145.6 million) from 328 million in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>The result was in line with analysts' mean forecast for a profit of 661 million markka in a range of 600 to 764 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The good performance at the beginning of the year, and the consistently strong order backlog, are expected to contribute to clearly improved results for the full year,&quot; Valmet said in a statement.</p>
<p>In 1995, Valmet's profit after financial items was 637 million markka.</p>
<p>&quot;The existing order backlog also indicates a positive outlook for the company in 1997,&quot; Valmet said.</p>
<p>At the end of August, Valmet's Paper and Board Machines division's order backlog stood at 8.1 billion markka, up from 7.8 bllion markka at end-April.</p>
<p>Valmet president and CEO Matti Sundberg told a news conference that while the outlook for paper machine demand was steady, he did not expect any boom.</p>
<p>The company said in its interim report that &quot;the level of interest in new investments has continued (to be) low in North America and Europe, whereas investment activity has remained at a good level in Asia.&quot;</p>
<p>Valmet's paper and board machinery division accounted for 83 percent of its 7.4 billion markka January-August net sales.</p>
<p>The company said it intends to boost paper machine maintenance to about one third of its net sales by the year 2000 from less than 20 percent currently.</p>
<p>&quot;Our target is to raise the maintenance business to about one third of group net sales by the year 2000,&quot; Sundberg told a news conference.</p>
<p>Valmet plans to expand its maintenance network particularly in the fast-growing South-East Asian and Latin American markets and this will help selling new paper machines in the regions, Sundberg said.</p>
<p>Valmet further said it expected annual output at its car assembly plant in Uusikaupunki to rise to 30,000 cars.</p>
<p>&quot;Valmet Automotives' exclusive production models -- the SAAB Cabriolet, the Opel Calibra and the new Euro Samara -- will reach annual output at Uusikaupunki of approximately 30,000 vehicles, around 50 percent more than last year,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The statement did not make clear whether this increase would happen already this year, or only later.</p>
<p>Valmet Automotive's January-August net sales rose to 311 million markka, from 279 million markka a year earlier, and the unit accounted for slightly more than four percent of group net sales during the period.</p>
<p>Valmet said the unit's result trend was positive.</p>
<p>Asked about acquisition prospects, Sundberg said Valmet had no plans to buy any of its major competitors in the paper machine business. He said said Valmet is the world's leader in paper machine business with more than 30 percent of the market.</p>
<p>Valmet's main competitors in the paper machine industry are U.S. company Beloit, part of Harnischfeger group, and Swiss-German Voith-Sulzer. ($1=4.56 Markka)</p>
