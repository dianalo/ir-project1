<title>SWITZERLAND: S.Africa's Stals see further rand strength.</title>
<headline>S.Africa's Stals see further rand strength.</headline>

<p>South African Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals said on Friday the rand's current strength could continue for another few months after its average weighted value rose two percent in January.</p>
<p>&quot;The relative strength of the rand could continue for another few months. What we are looking for is a more stable exchange rate,&quot; he told Reuters Financial Television in an interview.  </p>
<p>He said that in January there was a surplus of dollars in the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>He said the Reserve Bank would &quot;lean against the wind&quot; in the foreign exchange market if the rand rose too fast against the dollar. The bank had already bought dollars on the market in January, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly have many means at our disposal to intervene in the market if we regard it as necessary,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said rand strength was mainly the result of more positive expectations, and the surplus of dollars followed an improvement in the current account of the balance of payments and portfolio investment.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like foreign investors are showing a new interest in portfolio investment in South Africa,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked about the prospects for a cut in interest rates later in the year, Stals said: &quot;Yes, with the emphasis on later in the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Stals said a reduction in growth rates of financial aggregates, most notably a slowdown in bank credit and money supply growth, were encouraging.</p>
