<p>India's bureaucracy, overlapping authority between state and federal governments, lack of transparency and arbitrary abuse of power are scaring investors, Canada's High Commissioner to India said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Stanley Gooch, the High Commissioner, told the Indian Merchants Chamber in Bombay, that investors are hoping India will press ahead with reforms to show the liberalisation drive pursued after 1991 has not waned.</p>
<p>In a speech aimed at encouraging trade and investment between the two countries, he singled out insurance as one sector in India which Canadian firms were looking to enter.</p>
<p>&quot;At least four outstanding Canadian insurance firms are strongly interested in the insurance sector,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Several companies have already announced joint ventures with Indian companies in anticipation of the opening of this sector to foreign investment,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Gooch also promoted Canadian companies abilities to help India develop its over-strained infrastructure in such areas as power, transport and telecommunications but he warned of several deterrents to foreign investors.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me be very frank, continued excessive red tape, endless overlapping clearances between the centre and state and even between the agencies and departments at the same level of government, as well as lack of transparency and arbitrary abuse of power are seriously threatening to scare away partners who have already made a committment to India,&quot; Gooch said.</p>
<p>&quot;Indian ministers and leaders must understand that foreign partners will not wait endlessly for policies to be clarified or for clearances to be issued,' he warned.</p>
<p>Gooch said Canada, which hosts an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Vancouver next November, &quot;is committed to developing a membership criteria which will enable India to join APEC.&quot;</p>
<p>Two-way trade between Canada and India almost hit one billion dollars in 1996. Indian exports to Canada have grown 83 percent in the last three years and it has a $100 million trade surplus with Canada, Gooch said.</p>
