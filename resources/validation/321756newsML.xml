<p>CBOT soymeal futures closed mostly higher, led by the January contract with strength tied to short covering ahead of expiry on Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>Soyoil futures tumbled, pressured by heavy deliveries and speculation of more to come.</p>
<p>Soymeal closed $2.40 per ton higher to $0.30 lower with March up $1.40 at $238.10. Soyoil ended 0.24 to 0.16 cent per lb lower with March off 0.24 at 24.09.</p>
<p>Traders said Cargill Inc bought at least 50 lots January soymeal, LIT America bought 150 lots January and E.D. and F. Man International bought 50 lots January. Farmers Commodities Corp sold at least 150 lots January, traders said.</p>
<p>Funds and commercials were also said to be spreading out of January positions ahead of expiry.</p>
<p>ADM reportedly spread 150 lots March/January, Refco spread 50 lots January/May and Tenco Inc spread 75 lots January/March, traders said.</p>
<p>Open interest in the January contract was pegged at 1,313 lots as of Monday, down 1,109 lots since Friday, CBOT said.</p>
<p>Soyoil futures fell back to levels seen before USDA's January crop report which indicated U.S. soybean production and ending stocks figures were lower than trade expectations.</p>
<p>January soyoil rallied about one cent per lb on the January 10 news but values have fallen 0.65 cent since then, pressured by heavy deliveries and slack demand.</p>
<p>Registrations of soyoil in deliverable locations rose by 33 lots on Monday to 4,868 lots, prompting ideas of continued heavy deliveries.</p>
<p>ADM reportedly sold 50 lots January soyoil on the day and Produce Grain sold at least 250 lots March, traders said.  </p>
<p>Soymeal volume was estimated by the CBOT at 15,000 lots, against Monday's total of 23,546 lots. Soyoil volume was pegged at 14,000 lots, compared with Monday's volume of 17,440 lots, CBOT said.</p>
