<p>Chilean blue chips closed higher in steady trade with the market bolstered by Wall Street's surge and lower-than-expected economic growth in January, said dealers.</p>
<p>The market is expected to open cautiously with attention focused on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Tuesday, they said.</p>
<p>The selective index ended up 0.37 percent at 113.34 points. The general firmed 0.17 percent to 5,269.57 points on turnover of 11.6 billion pesos.</p>
<p>Investors reacted positively to news the economy grew just 4.7 percent in January, which boosted hopes the Central Bank could soon cut interest rates again, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy has slowed right down which is good news,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;We can now expect to see lower rates in the near future.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts had forecast the Imacec index would show the economy growing between 5-5.5 percent in January.</p>
<p>Power stocks gained ground on hopes heavy rainfall at the weekend could herald the end of the drought that has hurt company earnings over the last six months.</p>
<p>Endesa ended up 1.79 percent at 256-1/2 pesos, while Chilgener firmed 0.55 percent to 2,755 pesos.</p>
<p>Losers included forestry firm Masisa, down 4.53 percent at 205-1/4 pesos, steel-maker Cap, down 1.96 percent at 1,000 pesos and copper products manufacturer Madeco, which shed 0.99 percent at 1,000 pesos.</p>
