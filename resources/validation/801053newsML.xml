<p>Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd said on Thursday it was targeting a pre-tax profit of a billion ringgit ($361 million) in the current year after posting a 32 percent jump in earnings in the year ended in March.</p>
<p>&quot;We are hoping to join the billion ringgit profit club,&quot; said chief executive officer Abdul Aziz Othman.</p>
<p>&quot;Barring any unforeseen circumstances, I'm confident that we can reach that figure,&quot; he told reporters when announcing the bank's financial results.</p>
<p>Malaysia's second largest bank on Thursday reported a group pre-tax profit of 724.3 million ringgit for the year to March against 547.3 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Net income rose 29 percent to 1.61 billion ringgit from 1.25 billion.</p>
<p>Bank Bumiputra chairman Abdul Khalid Sahan said the performance was supported by the country's strong economy, which provided the momentum for the continuous strong growth of the banking industry.</p>
<p>It was also the result of various initiatives undertaken by the bank to boost efficiency, he said.</p>
<p>The group's commercial bank continued to account for most of the profit, contributing 539.7 million ringgit, up 33 percent from 405.7 million.</p>
<p>The state-owned bank's BBMB Securities Bhd stockbroking unit had a pre-tax profit of 61.9 million ringgit against 11.8 million previously. This was due to higher trading volume in the stock market during the financial year.</p>
<p>BBMB Kewangan Bhd, the group's finance subsidiary, also registered a profit of 61.9 million ringgit, a 23.3 percent increase.</p>
<p>However, the group's merchant banking and unit trust management arms recorded lower profits.</p>
<p>Bumiputra Merchant Bankers Bhd had a pre-tax profit of 27.8 million ringgit, down from 39.9 million, while BBMB Unit Trust Management Bhd's pre-tax profit dropped to three million ringgit from 4.4 million.</p>
<p>Abdul Khalid said the fall was due to stiffer competition.</p>
<p>On the bank's listing plans, Abdul Khalid said the exercise was &quot;in the final stage of decision making&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It's up to the shareholders,&quot; he said, but declined to say when the bank was expected to be listed.</p>
<p>Bank Bumiputra was lined up as one of the 17 major state-owned enterprises to be privatised by 2000.</p>
<p>Bank Bumiputra has shareholders' funds of 3.2 billion ringgit.</p>
<p>CEO Abdul Aziz said the bank was also not ruling out a possible merger.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an option to consider. We have to be big in order to compete with foreign banks later,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Local banks have been urged to become bigger and better capitalised through mergers to face competition from foreign institutions when Malaysia open its financial sector by 2005 under its World Trade Organisation commitments.</p>
