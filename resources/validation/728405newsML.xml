<headline>UK water firms given rare but cautious praise.</headline>

<p>Britain's water companies received rare praise on Tuesday from the government for its plans to improve customer service, but they remain under the spotlight over implementing the proposals.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they've responded in a positive way and I'm able to say we're well on the way to establishing a national strategy for water supply and quality,&quot; deputy prime minister John Prescott told BBC radio.</p>
<p>The new centre-left Labour government took the companies to task and launched a 10-point plan for the industry at a crisis summit in May with a three-week deadline for responses.</p>
<p>Prescott was announcing the responses to a press conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Central to the plan was the introduction of mandatory targets for cutting leaks, which currently allow some 30 percent of supplies to seep out of the system daily, a level which Prescott said was &quot;appalling.&quot;</p>
<p>The government would like to see leakage reduced to around 10-15 percent of supplies, environment minister Michael Meacher told the press conference.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no question of an economic leakage level being anything like as high as 26 percent,&quot; Meacher said, adding that New York has around 10-15 percent of supplies seeping out of its system. &quot;That's the kind of thing we're looking for,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The mandatory targets will be set in conjunction with industry regulator Ofwat and Prescott said he would be writing to companies again by the end of the year to track their progress in complying with this and other aspects of the plan.</p>
<p>&quot;We will certainly be keeping up the pressure,&quot; he said, &quot;I shall be looking for sustained commitment to all of these actions.&quot;</p>
<p>He did not give details of what action could be taken for companies which fell short of targets, but said &quot;we can impose (penalties) in a very effective way...through the regulator.&quot;</p>
<p>The new centre-left Labour government has been fiercely critical of water companies, which have allowed nearly 800 million gallons to leak out of pipes daily while struggling to maintain non-essential supplies during a recent two-year drought.</p>
<p>The government has also slammed their high profits and dividends and doused them with a 1.65 billion pound ($2.8 billion) share of a 5.2 billion levy on the excess profits of utilities which were privatised by previous Conservative administrations.</p>
<p>&quot;We always considered that it was a question of priorities,&quot; said the GMB union, one of the largest in the water industry.</p>
<p>&quot;The GMB have always claimed that the (water) industry was profitable enough to invest money in stopping leaks and compensating customers when supplies were interrupted,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Prescott suggested high dividend payouts and profits should not come at the expense of fulfilling the targets of the plans.</p>
<p>&quot;No doubt if (the regulator) thinks they've been making excess profits he might want to take it away (at the next price review in 1999),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, relations seemed to have improved with the Department of the Environment claiming to have united companies in providing better service.</p>
<p>All companies are now offering a free service to repair leaks on pipes from mains system to the houses of customers and all are taking action to promote efficient use of water.</p>
<p>Prescott made it clear that he expected all companies to agree to changes in their licences to allow compensation for cuts in supply because of drought and to agree contingency plans for such emergencies with the environment agency.</p>
<p>The government launched a review of abstraction, the system which allows water from rivers to be taken out into supplies, in line with commitments made at the summit in May.</p>
<p>The review will be conducted by the Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office in conjunction with the Environment Agency and industry regulator Ofwat.</p>
<p>Reviews of regulation and pricing, also presented at the summit, have already started.</p>
