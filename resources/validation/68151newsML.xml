<p>Shenzhen's B share index inched to a lower close in light trading on Friday, with investors sidelined in the absence of fresh incentives, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B share index lost 0.37 points, or 0.42 percent, to end at 87.36, with turnover shrinking to HK$8.96 million from HK$13.54 million on Thursday.</p>
<p>The A share market rose 3.85 points, or 1.46 percent, to close at 266.54 on turnover of 3.47 billion yuan, compared with 3.79 billion yuan on Thursday. The composite index gained 3.34 points, or 1.34 percent, to finish at 251.90.  </p>
<p>Investors were reluctant to enter the market ahead of the weekend, with speculative buying of lower-priced issues, brokers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said the A share rise was linked to rumours that Beijing planned to further tighten controls of the country's commodities futures market, which could lead to a diversion of funds into the stock market.</p>
<p>On the B share market, Shenzhen Petrochemical was the worst performer, falling HK$0.10, or 4.26 percent, to HK$2.25.</p>
<p>Shenzhen International Enterprise followed suit, down HK$0.10, or 3.89 percent, to HK$2.47.  </p>
<p>Shenzhen Textile sank HK$0.06, or 3.45 percent, to HK$1.68. Investor confidence in Shenzhen-listed textile issues has been badly hit by their very poor first-half results, brokers said.</p>
<p>SEZ Real Estate fell HK$0.07, or 2.40 percent, to HK$2.85 and China Merchants fell HK$0.07, or 1.99 percent, to HK$3.45.</p>
<p>China Bicycle edged down HK$0.01 to HK$1.78 on the day's heaviest trade of 954,500 shares due to profit-taking, brokers said.</p>
<p>Floppy disk maker Benelux was the biggest gainer, rising HK$0.08, or 3.52 percent, to HK$2.35 on thin trade of 12,600 shares.  </p>
<p>On the A share market, Zhuhai Huadian was the star with a surge of 0.38 yuan, or 8.88 percent, to 4.66 yuan on speculative buying. Guiyang Zhongtian put on 0.42 yuan, or 8.11 percent, to 5.60 yuan.</p>
<p>Gold mining concern Inner Mongolia Hongfeng, which put in the strongest performance on Thursday, fell back 0.54 yuan, or 6.47 percent, to 7.81 yuan on Friday.</p>
