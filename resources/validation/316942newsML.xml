<p>The flight of shuttle Atlantis may be extended by one day so astronauts can repeat a test of a space exercise machine, officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The shuttle crew first ran a test of the treadmill device before docking with Russia's Mir station on Tuesday, but ground controllers later discovered that a laptop computer had failed to record the treadmill's performance.</p>
<p>The exercise device, which is designed to minimise vibration which could ruin sensitive microgravity experiments, is supposed to be used aboard the future international space station.</p>
<p>The shuttle crew were to repeat the treadmill test after Atlantis departs Mir on Sunday, but if they encounter problems, an extra day may be necessary to complete the test.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll decide Monday morning whether we will actually add that day or not,&quot; mission operations director Bob Castle said at news conference.</p>
<p>The weather forecast for the shuttle's planned Florida landing would be an important factor in that decision, he said.</p>
<p>Atlantis was due to return to earth on Wednesday when the weather was expected to be good, but conditions were to deteriorate the following day.</p>
<p>&quot;The weather would argue to not extend,&quot; Castle said. &quot;But this is a pretty advanced forecast and that's why we'd like to wait as late as we can to decide whether to extend or not.&quot;</p>
<p>The shuttle and Mir crews were nearing the end of their joint work. Only 15-20 items needed to be moved between the two craft before the shuttle undocked on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Atlantis will leave behind astronaut Jerry Linenger for a four-month stay on Mir. His predecessor, John Blaha, will return to earth aboard the shuttle.</p>
<p>At the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, structural engineers were examining the launch platform of space shuttle Discovery on Saturday to check it is safe for a planned Feb. 11 blastoff.</p>
<p>The inspections were ordered after a 24-ft-long crack appeared in the platform on Friday as the shuttle was being moved to its launch pad. Also, doors within the massive structure jammed.</p>
<p>Discovery was being readied for a mission to refurbish the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
