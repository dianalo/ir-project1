<p>Anglo-Norwegian construction and engineering group Kvaerner ASA is expected to show moderate growth over the next few years, with Asia playing a central role in the company's development, Kvaerner head Erik Toenseth said on Monday.</p>
<p>In an interview with the daily financial Dagens Naeringsliv (DN), Toenseth said he expected the London-headquartered group, which is listed on the London and Oslo stock exchanges, to gain a listing on another bourse within 12 months.</p>
<p>&quot;Kvaerner will grow moderately in the next few years, between five and 10 percent per year, and maybe in some years not even that,&quot; Toenseth told DN. &quot;We will grow organically, not through acquisitions. We are so large now we do not need any quantum leap.&quot;</p>
<p>In the next couple of years 50 percent of Kvaerner's order in-take was expected to come from Asia, but Toenseth also saw large investment opportunities in Latin America.</p>
<p>In the longer term Russia and eastern Europe also would be important new areas, DN said.</p>
<p>Toenseth said growth and reduction of the group's interest-bearing debt -- Kvaerner acquired British conglomerate Trafalgar House Plc in April last year for nine billion crowns -- were near-term priorities.</p>
<p>&quot;Within 12 months Kvaerner will be listed on a new bourse. Asia is more probable than, for example, New York, but we are also considering listings on many exchanges,&quot; Toenseth said.</p>
<p>DN said one solution to Kvaerner's debt problem would be to spin off projects into their own companies and list these separate companies. For example Kvaerner could put all its Asian bridge projects into one company and list it in Hong Kong or Singapore, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that could happen in two to three years and in the longer-term I can see several such companies,&quot; Toenseth said.</p>
