<p>Traffic jams hit Buenos Aires as Thursday's 24-hour general strike reduced public transport and forced office workers to take cars into work.</p>
<p>The government said only 40 percent of buses and 30 percent of trains were working in Buenos Aires. But the city's subway service was running at 70 percent, according to the state-run Telam news agency.</p>
<p>But a spokesman for Argentina's main labor federation, the CGT, said the strike which began at midnight had &quot;a very high level of participation&quot;.  </p>
<p>CGT spokesman Carlos West Ocampo said the strike had completely paralyzed the provincial cities of Rosario and Crdoba.</p>
<p>Transport workers spokesman Mario Callegari told the private DyN news agency that only some buses were working in Buenos Aires but forecast that they would disappear by midday.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the flag carrier Aerolneas Argentinas said all flights were leaving normally. Aerolneas workers said they were joining the stoppage and the company had hired temporary personnel.  </p>
<p>Unions called the strike last week after President Carlos Menem signed three decrees designed to make the labor market The moves allow workers to decide which union health plan they sign up to and permit smaller firms to bypass national unions in collective wage talks with workers. Also, employers will now be able to appeal to the government if they want to negotiate with unions on a company-by-company and not an industry-wide basis.</p>
<p>The government, which plans more labor decrees, hopes that a more flexible employment market will help reduce the country's 17.3 percent joblessness rate.</p>
