<p>Stocks capped a record-breaking week with a broad-based rally Friday, inspired by further evidence that inflation is under control.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 70.57 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,782.04, its sixth consecutive record. With Friday's advance, the Dow has risen 477 points, or 6.5 percent, in the past six sessions.</p>
<p>For the week, the Dow rose a record 346.26 points, topping the rise of 332 points set the week ended May 2.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just sort of a classic buying panic,&quot; said John Church, chief investment officer at Glenmede Trust Co.</p>
<p>Reflecting the breadth of the rally, rising issues beat losers by 1,724 to 814 on heavy volume of 566.9 million on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>After lagging for most of the week, the Nasdaq composite index joined in and rose 11.71 points to 1,423.03, a record. It rose 18.19 points for the week. The previous record of 1,412.04 was set on Monday.</p>
<p>The latest catalyst for stocks was a report of an unexpected drop in the Producer Price Index for May, the fifth consecutive month the index has declined.</p>
<p>The Labour Department reported the PPI dropped 0.3 percent in May after a 0.6 percent fall in April. Economists on average had expected the May PPI to rise 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>The data, coupled with other recent statistics including Thursday's report on soft May retail sales, indicate little sign of inflation that could spur the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>The data &quot;is going to make it very difficult for the Fed to raise rates,&quot; said Bruce Bittles, market strategist at J.C. Bradford.</p>
<p>While Wall Street stocks appear to be gathering momentum with each session, some pullback in the coming days could be in store, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>They cited the sharp rise in the past days and upcoming economic data, including Tuesday's report on retail inflation in May, which could trigger profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;You've had a huge amount of buying power used up here in the last few days,&quot; said James Volk, director of equity trading at Jensen Securities.</p>
<p>Among individual stocks, American Express Co. rose 3-1/2 to 76-5/8 and Citicorp added 1-3/8 to 120-3/8 on market rumours they had resumed merger talks. The two declined to comment.</p>
<p>DuPont Co. gained 1-1/8 to 58-7/8. A Morgan Stanley analyst upgraded his rating on the stock to strong buy from outperform, citing expectations of strength in the company's pharmaceutical and agricultural products businesses.</p>
<p>Monsanto Co. tumbled 3-1/2 to 42-3/4 after J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded the stock.</p>
<p>Shares of Maximus Inc., a provider of programme management and consulting services, rose two to 18 on their first day of trading.</p>
<p>Netscape Communications Corp. fell 1-1/16 to 32-1/4 after saying it was investigating a potential bug found in test versions of its Internet browser. It later said it replicated the bug and planned to offer a fix early next week.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 9.79 points to a record 893.27, for a gain of 35.26 on the week. The American Stock Exchange index added 3.98 to 630.10 and was up 15.45 from last Friday.</p>
<p>The NYSE composite index of all listed common stocks rose 4.53 to 465.17, a record. For the week it rose 17.04. The average price per share rose 44 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues also known as the Wilshire 5000 -- was 8,409.926, up 75.711 or 0.91 percent. The index was up 269.768 on the week.</p>
