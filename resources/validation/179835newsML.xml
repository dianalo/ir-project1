<p>Russian space officials gave their $64 million mission to Mars a green light on Monday and said the six-tonne probe would blast off on a 10-month mission on Saturday.</p>
<p>It will be Earth's second mission to Mars in two weeks. The invasion started last Thursday when the U.S. launched the first of three robot voyages to the Red Planet, target of intense speculation whether life exists or once existed there.</p>
<p>The Russian launch will be followed by the second U.S. probe, Mars Pathfinder, on Dec 2.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe we can resolve one of the secrets of Mars, whether there can be organic elements there,&quot; Russian mission head Albert Galeyev told a news conference.</p>
<p>But he declined to comment on whether there could be traces of life on the icy planet, some 100 million km (60 million miles) from Earth.</p>
<p>Mars-96, being launched two years behind the original schedule, will carry 1.1 tonnes of scientific equipment from 20 European countries and the United States. It is due to reach Mars on September 12 next year.</p>
<p>But cost constraints in the Russian space agency mean that, unlike for the U.S. probes, there will be no back-up if things with the Russian launch go wrong.</p>
<p>The Russian probe includes two special drilling devices to bore up to five metres (16 feet) into the surface of the planet, beaming information back to the orbiting probe.</p>
<p>Galeyev said one goal was to search for the existence of water on Mars -- a key clue to the question of whether the planet could have supported life.</p>
<p>One drill is equipped with a U.S.-made device to search for organic traces in Mars' soil.</p>
<p>Yuri Milov, deputy head of the Russian space agency, said Russia had spent 350 billion roubles ($64 million) over two years to prepare for the mission. &quot;Almost all the money came from the state budget,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Officials said the Russian-made drilling devices and a tiny U.S.-designed six-wheeled rover would land several hundred km from each other to investigate the widest possible area of the surface of the planet.</p>
<p>Russia also planned to set up four weather and seismology monitoring stations to observe changes in the soil and in the atmosphere, they added.</p>
<p>The U.S. space agency NASA launched its Mars Global Surveyor last week.</p>
<p>The one-tonne craft replaced NASA's $1 billion Mars Observer probe, which spun out of control in 1993, days before it was due to enter orbit around the Red Planet.</p>
<p>Surveyor has identical copies of five of the seven scientific instruments on its ill-fated predecessor, but at $215 million is much cheaper.</p>
<p>Its sophisticated camera will see objects on the surface of the planet as small as a car from an altitude of 230 miles (370 km) and will map 99 percent of the planet during one Martian year -- or 687 Earth days.</p>
<p>Other instruments will determine the composition of the Martian surface and attempt to detect traces of water, an essential ingredient for life.</p>
