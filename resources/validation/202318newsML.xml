<p>Shares in Slovenia's only port, Luka Koper  LKPG.LJ, making its debut on the Ljubljana bourse on Wednesday, slumped amid active trading as investors rushed to cash in profits.</p>
<p>Luka Koper closed at 2,200 tolars, down from its opening price of 2,600 -- but still way above its issue price of 1,390. Turnover was a high 58,400 shares, dwarfing the second most actively traded Kolinska on just 5,000 lots.</p>
<p>&quot;Luka's shares eased....as investors who bought them on the grey market over the past few months decided to cash in their profits,&quot; said Nina Jarc, a trader at Nova Ljubljanska banka.</p>
<p>Luka's shares last traded on the grey market at between 2,000 and 2,100 tolars.</p>
<p>Market analysts said Luka's price could rise significantly if the state, which owns 51 percent of the company's equity, decided to allow foreign investors to buy.</p>
<p>&quot;That will be a decisive factor as far as price and turnover of Luka's shares are concerned,&quot; said Danilo Grasic, a trader at Creditanstalt.</p>
<p>&quot;For now foreigners have no chance to buy the share. We asked the ministry of finance to explain the procedure for foreign buying, but have yet to receive a reply,&quot; Florian Hellmich, analyst at Investmentbank Austria in Vienna said.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the government will let foreigners buy up to 10 percent of Luka's equity,&quot; said Toni Apollonio, an analyst at bank A banka.</p>
<p>Foreign interest in Luka was high, traders said, because of the port's good earnings and prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;Luka Koper has a very good geographic position and is unlikely to run out of business,&quot; Nova Ljubljanska's Jarc said.</p>
<p>The port, located on the northern shores of the Adriatic, near the Italian border, turned in a net profit of 877.4 million tolars ($6.4 million) in 1995, up from 646.1 million in 1994.</p>
<p>Sales jumped to 7.2 billion tolars from 6.2 billion.</p>
<p>Cargo traffic rose to 6.7 million tonnes in 1995 from 6.3 million a year earlier. The port said it expected cargo figures to grow to 7.5 million tonnes by the year 2000.</p>
<p>The company said it expected the state to approve foreign buying, although the finance ministry has so far remained quiet.</p>
<p>&quot;Recently we had several visits of investment companies from the U.S., Austria, Great Britain and Italy who were interested in buying our shares,&quot; said Luka chief executive Bruno Koralic.</p>
<p>The company listed 4.66 million shares with a nominal value of 1,000 tolars a share, representing 33.3 percent of the firm's equity.</p>
