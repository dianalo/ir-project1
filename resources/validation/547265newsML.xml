<p>The Clinton administration on Tuesday joined members of Congress in launching a bipartisan initiative to promote trade and economic development in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>In an unusual alliance across party lines, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich agreed with President Bill Clinton that the United States needed a new economic policy for an area long neglected by the superpowers.</p>
<p>Gingrich, in testimony at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, said the initiative offered a chance for the United States to form a partnership with African nations. &quot;We have an opportunity to form a genuine partnership,&quot; he said, adding that the United States should tell Africans, &quot;We want to work with you on the right economic policies.&quot;</p>
<p>He said those policies should include low taxes and high investment and he endorsed bipartisan legislation directing the president to develop plans for a U.S.-sub-Saharan Africa free trade area. The administration's &quot;Partnership for Promoting Economic Growth and Opportunity in Africa&quot; emphasised support for countries that make efforts to open their markets and become more involved in global trade.</p>
<p>&quot;In an increasingly competitive global economy, the United States cannot afford to neglect a largely untapped market of some 600-million-plus people, and the world cannot afford to see a vast region marginalized,&quot; U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told the committee.</p>
<p>&quot;The lowering of tariffs and other trade barriers will help African nations to grow,&quot; she said. &quot;They will also help Americans by opening these markets to our goods and services.&quot;</p>
<p>She said Africa's share of trade in the last 40 years had fallen from 3.1 percent to a scant 1.2 percent. A recent World Bank study blamed restrictive trade barriers that incorporate a substantial anti-export bias, she said.</p>
<p>The initiative calls for expanding the General System of Preferences programme, which allows products from poor countries into the United States duty free, to include more products from African countries undertaking bold reforms, Barshefsky said. She also called on Congress to act quickly to re-authorise the GSP programme, which expires at the end of May.</p>
<p>She said the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) was working with private investors on a proposed $150 million fund for equity investment in a number of sectors. Two-thirds of the fund would consist of OPIC guaranteed debt. She said OPIC was working to develop separate funds for infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the United States would support efforts to reduce the debt burden of African countries that liberalise trade and investment. He said the United States would support an approach that leads to elimination of concessional bilateral debt for the poorest countries that undertake bold reforms.</p>
<p>Washington would urge the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to provide maximum relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative for eligible countries, Summer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The budgets of many African countries are both heavily burdened by debt service and highly dependent on revenues from trade taxes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Typically 40 to 50 percent of total budget revenues come from trade taxes. We want to see to it that aggressively liberalising countries have enough breathing space to carry through with a comprehensive programme of trade liberalisation and tax reforms.&quot;</p>
<p>Other witnesses testifying in favour of the legislation included Jack Kemp, the 1996 Republican vice presidential nominee, and ambassadors from several African nations including South Africa, Kenya and Ethiopa.</p>
