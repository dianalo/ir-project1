<p>Difficult conditions in the U.S. retail book market have forced British publisher Dorling Kindersley Holdings Plc to issue a profit warning, group managing director Rod Hare said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The primary factor for the downgrade in the profit forecast is...the U.S. book market has not performed as expected,&quot; Hare told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Dorling said earlier that full year profits would be lower than those of last year. The company restated pre-tax profit for the year to June 30 1996 as 12.9 million stg rather than 17.4 million to reflect a change in accounting policy in respect of multimedia development costs.  </p>
<p>Hare said that Dorling had also been hurt by the strength of sterling against the dollar, which he said would result in &quot;well over a million pounds of lost profit&quot;.</p>
<p>The full-year performance will also take a hit from a decision to increase investment in the DK Family Learning direct selling business, which operates in Britain and the U.S. and the new markets of Australia and Russia.</p>
<p>Hare said that Dorling had suffered from a change in policy at U.S. book retail chains Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble, which had cleared out their stock and cut new orders after their store expansion programmes slowed.  </p>
<p>Hare said that Dorling believed a more normal re-order pattern would be restored from the spring onwards for back order books, However, he expects the major U.S. chains to continue to order less initial stock of new titles.</p>
<p>The company plans to expand its direct selling business into India, New Zealand, South Africa, Mexico and maybe Singapore.</p>
<p>Hare said the launch of direct selling in Russia and Australia had required investment of around one million stg in each of those markets.</p>
<p>However, he said the push into the other new markets would not be as costly as the plans for South Africa and Singapore involved only scaled-down operations.</p>
