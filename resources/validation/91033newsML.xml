<p>Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) said on Wednesday Singapore's equity market led the weakest performers in developed markets in the third quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Singapore was closely followed by Japan and Austria.</p>
<p>Japan was among the hardest hit developed markets in the July correction because of the weak pace of economic growth and stocks there continued to fall in August, leaving the market with a decline for a quarter despite a rebound in September.</p>
<p>MSCI said in a statement the strongest performers in the third quarter among developed countries were Finland, Britain and Sweden.</p>
<p>It said investors in the U.K. were attracted to equities by better than expected gross domestic product growth, forecasts for higher corporate profits and strength in the British pound.</p>
<p>It added the equity markets of Hong Kong, Italy, France and the U.S. were the strongest developed markets in September.</p>
<p>MSCI said world equity markets moved higher in September, continuing a rebound from the sharp correction in July.</p>
<p>The MSCI World Index of 22 developed markets climbed 3.8 percent during September, led by gains in the U.S., which helped push the index to an overall gain of 0.9 percent for the third quarter.</p>
