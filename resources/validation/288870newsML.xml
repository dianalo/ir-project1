<p>CONGRESS SENDS WARNING TO GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>The Congress asked Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's government to adopt a pro-poor approach and desist from anti-people policies without further delay. This warning to the coalition government was issued by Sharad Pawar, new leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha (Lower House). He said his party would not remain quiet over the issue of the rising prices of essential commodities and the shortage of wheat. Pawar's warning came a day after Congress chief Sitaram Kesri warned the government that its functioning would be closely monitored by the party.</p>

<p>GOVERNOR READY FOR MINORITY GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>Uttar Pradesh Governor Romesh Bhandari said he had started taking major decisions because the people of the state could not be allowed to suffer for the political parties' failure to form a coalition government. The governor denied that he was working on any political agenda. He said he was ready to install a Bahujan Samajwadi Party government backed by the Bharatiya Janata Party from outside if the leaders of the two parties informed him in writing about the arrangement. He rejected criticism that the steps taken by him in the last few days to streamline the administration indicated his political ambition or that he was working at the behest of the federal government.</p>

<p>ESSAR'S OFFER FOR STERLING COMPUTERS TO GET SEBI ASSENT</p>
<p>The stock market regulator is ready to clear the public offer of the Essar group to shareholders of Sterling Computers. The offer follows Essar's takeover of Sterling by buying 80 percent equity for 2.12 billion rupees. The public offer was made at the market regulator's behest as existing norms do not cover indirect takeovers. Essar's move will become the first case where a public offer has been made in case of an indirect takeover. It will also be the first company to acquire 100 percent equity from the public and delist from the bourses with their permission.</p>

<p>PANEL TO SPEED UP FOREIGN INVESTOR CLEARANCE</p>

The committee, to be set up on the lines of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, is expected to clear fresh FII registrations within 15 days as opposed to several months taken now.</p>

<p>SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES MAY BE FREED</p>
<p>The central bank is studying a proposal to lift all interest rate and maturity restrictions on short-term borrowings of financial institutions (FIs). This, however, will be done, only if all short-term borrowings of FIs will attract cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio requirements on an incremental basis. According to top-level banking sources, FIs have urged that they should be allowed the same freedom as banks in raising short-term funds.</p>

<p>STATE BANK TOLD TO SLASH EXPOSURE LIMITS</p>

The PSUs include Indian Oil Corporation, Steel Authority of India Ltd and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation. RBI sources said SBI's exposure to these three PSUs as on March 31, 1996 was much above the exposure limit allowed by the prudential lending norms. For the groups, the exposure could be up to 50 percent of the bank's net worth, but SBI's exposures to these PSUs were way above 60 percent, RBI sources added.</p>

<p>MOVE TO ABOLISH CONCEPT OF GOVERNMENT COMPANY</p>
<p>The working group set up to draft changes in the Companies Act is considering the option of doing away with the concept of government companies. The abolition of the concept of government companies from the Companies Act will take the 250-odd public sector enterprises out of the ambit of audits by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India and the Central Vigilance Commission. This is in line with the government's move to provide public sector managements with greater freedom and autonomy.</p>

<p>PRESUMPTIVE TAX LIKELY TO END DOUBLE TAXATION ON DIVIDENDS</p>
<p>The government is considering a form of presumptive tax to end double taxation of dividends. The new concept is expected to be included in the report being compiled on the subject by the Finance Ministry. Industry has been demanding for long that the Finance Ministry do away with double taxation of dividends through either total exemption or a system of tax credit/imputation system. The government is also exploring the possibility of expanding the scope of expenditure tax.</p>

<p>DECISION ON FULL CONVERTIBILITY</p>

<p>APEX BANK MOOTS UPPER CAP ON LENDING BY BANKS</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) proposed that banks put an upper cap on lending rates. RBI sources said the move was aimed at smoothening the credit offtake, which had been at a low ebb for the last few months. They said the upper cap in bank lending rate should be mandatory in order to get back the confidence of the corporates. The RBI governor said the upper cap was required for greater transparency in the bank lending to the corporates.</p>
