<p>Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the head of the rebel Chechen government Aslan Maskhadov on Saturday signed a framework cooperation agreement, Itar-Tass news agency said.</p>
<p>The accord lays down the principles of relations between Russia and Chechnya for the period before January 27, when the breakaway region is due to hold elections, Tass said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, President Boris Yeltsin, in a big concession to the rebels, ordered all remaining Russian troops to leave Chechnya, where tens of thousands have been killed in Russia's 21-month bid to crush the separatists.</p>
<p>Tass said the two sides had agreed to restore trade in goods and services by December 1 and work out customs regulations. Air, rail and road traffic is also to be restored.</p>
<p>Another agreement describing &quot;special economic relations&quot; between Moscow and Chechnya was to be worked out after the election in the region. Moscow has been mulling a proposal to make Chechnya a free economic zone.</p>
<p>More importantly, the two sides vowed to sign a special deal on the transport and refining of oil on Chechen territory. The rebel government promised to guarantee safety of oil refineries and pipelines.</p>
<p>The document also said that payment of pensions, salaries and compensations to those who had suffered in the fighting was a priority for both sides.</p>
<p>Russia and Chechnya vowed &quot;not to take any action threatening the security&quot; of either side and to coordinate actions in the defence sphere, Tass said.</p>
