<p>The South African stock market was set for strong growth right into 1998 and a fall in interest rates could trigger bullish advances, a leading unit trust portfolio manager said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Arnold Shapiro, senior portfolio manager at Old Mutual Unit Trusts, predicted earnings on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange would grow by 30 percent up to January 31, 1998.</p>
<p>Shapiro told a news conference that the South African market stood on the verge of a bullish run and a cut in interest rates was needed to kick-start market growth.</p>
<p>&quot;We need a catalyst to start the South African bull market anew. The catalyst will be interest rates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Old Mutual Unit Trusts managing director Selwyn Feldman was also bullish about prospects for growth and the key role of a drop in interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Lower interest rates during 1997 should be positive for equities...we expect substantial growth for the overall market during the next 18 months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But recent hints from Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals indicated an imminent rate cut was not on the cards -- and they could even go up.</p>
<p>Stals told reporters at an International Monetary Fund meeting on Tuesday that the central bank would not cut interest rates unless it saw an improvement in the current account and would hike rates unless the figures improved.</p>
<p>Shapiro warned any rate hike would hamper the market's growth. &quot;If there is an increase it will delay the start (of a bull run),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shapiro said the overall economic outlook for South Africa was poised on a knife edge. The honeymoon period after the first democratic elections in 1994 had been replaced by fears over the fall in the value of the rand and concern over violent crime.</p>
<p>&quot;The honeymoon is over. The political dividend has been received,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Shapiro added that positive signs, such as sensible fiscal moves and market-friendly policies, outweighed the negative ones.</p>
<p>&quot;We are delicately poised at the moment for success or failure. At the moment the signs are for success,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>After South Africa's post-apartheid re-entry into global markets it had become paramount to attract, and maintain, the confidence of international investors.</p>
<p>The government's macro-economic plan, announced earlier this year by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, was the base upon which this confidence could be built. The scheme had impressed potential foreign investors.</p>
<p>The central plank of wooing foreign capital to South Africa should be rapid moves towards privatisation. Words need to be turned into actions, Shapiro said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have spoken about it, but we haven't done it yet and we need some action there,&quot; he added.</p>
