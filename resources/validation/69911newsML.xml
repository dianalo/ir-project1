<p>European business travellers dream of spending their travelling time in self-improvement, reading novels or simply sleeping, but very few of them do, according to a survey published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Fifty-six percent of travellers work while they are on the move, even though more than 90 percent of them believe that relaxation would improve their work performance, the survey for credit card firm Visa showed.</p>
<p>Britons and Swedes were the mostly likely to indulge in a doze while travelling, while most of their European colleagues said they had no time for such a luxury.</p>
<p>Industrious French, Spanish and Turkish travellers simply said they preferred to work.</p>
<p>Nearly 50 percent of Italians questioned said they would like to spend their travelling time in self-improvement, though in reality only 20 percent managed this.</p>
<p>Despite their reputation for romanticism, only 38 percent of French travellers said they would take their partners on a business trip, compared with 58 percent of Britons and around 50 percent of most other European travellers.</p>
