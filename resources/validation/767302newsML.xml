<p>Higher interest rates in Canada should support the anemic Canadian dollar, but the currency will remain weak during the next two years, said a Reuters poll of economists released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The quarterly survey, which polled 26 economists in Canada and the United States, predicted the Canadian dollar would rise to US$0.7352 by the end of 1997 and to US$0.75 by the end of next year.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll earlier this year projected that the Canadian dollar could rally to as high as US$0.80 by 1998.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar currently trades at US$0.7241, down almost three percent against the U.S. dollar in the past six months.</p>
<p>&quot;I get the sense that this stumble we've had recently is actually justified in terms of market confidence and information that is discounted into the currency,&quot; said Mark Mullins, chief economist with Midland Walwyn.</p>
<p>The survey found that hopes for a minor rebound in the value of the Canadian dollar rest on expectations of further interest rate moves by the Bank of Canada and the bank's willingness to match future U.S. Federal Reserve rate hikes.</p>
<p>Last month, the Bank of Canada hiked its key bank rate by 25 basis points to halt the Canadian dollar's erosion against the U.S. dollar. It was the first time in two years that the central bank raised rates.</p>
<p>The sudden hike, which surprised markets, fueled a spectacular one-day gain of almost one U.S. cent. Since then, the Canadian dollar has given up most of those gains.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank of Canada has done a very good job this year of matching expectations in the market,&quot; Mullins said. &quot;If the Fed moves, I fully expect the Bank of Canada to follow. If they (the Bank of Canada) don't, we've got a problem with the currency.&quot;</p>
<p>Jeoff Hall, economist with Technical Data in Boston, said that Canada's strong economic fundamentals would not be enough to offset political forces weighing down the Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;We weren't able to get the most out of the time in between the last Quebec referendum and what is going to be another Quebec referendum perhaps in late 1998,&quot; Hall said.</p>
<p>Canada's dollar fell sharply in the last Quebec referendum in October 1995, which ended with a narrow 50.6 to 49.4 percent vote against Quebec independence.</p>
<p>Quebec's separatist Parti Quebecois government is expected to call a provincial election in 1998.</p>
<p>Political experts expect that the re-election of a separatist government in Quebec would be quickly followed by another sovereignty referendum.</p>
<p>&quot;You can see why the political anxieties are beginning to take shape again. That will be reflected in the value of the (Canada) dollar,&quot; Hall said.</p>
