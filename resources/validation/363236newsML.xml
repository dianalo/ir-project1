<headline>Turk shares may rise more, but need fresh impetus.</headline>
<dateline>ISTANBUL 1997-02-07</dateline>

<p>After weeks of rally, fuelled by declining rates, growing hopes for faster sell-offs and lira liquidity, analysts say Turkish stocks have still room for a further rise, but there should be new progress on the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the expectations have been discounted. From now on, people will look at the actual realisation of these expectations,&quot; Erhan Topac, general manager of Gedik Securities, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Istanbul stock exchange index has risen 59.1 percent since the end of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock exchange is now in a digestion period,&quot; said Ertan Gungor, deputy general manager of private Tekstil Bank.</p>
<p>Gungor said the index had risen very sharply in nominal terms, but it was not very high in real terms.</p>
<p>&quot;The index has yet to reach its $2 level. That means it has not hit its highest point and has some way to go,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In dollar values, the index stood at $1.3 on Friday, up 45 percent since end-1996.</p>
<p>Analysts say any step towards long-awaited key structural measures would push up Turkish share prices further.</p>
<p>Turkey is struggling with high inflation, running at around 80 percent, and huge public deficit, expected to rise above 10 percent of the country's gross national product in 1996.</p>
<p>Businessmen and international financial institutions have long been urging Turkey to speed up privatisation, reform its loss-making social security system and widen its tax base under a medium-term stability programme.</p>
<p>Analysts say Turkey should implement an IMF-backed programme to attract more foreign funds and borrow at lower costs in international markets. Turkish officials said talks with the IMF were expected to resume in March.</p>
