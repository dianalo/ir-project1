<p>The Entre Rios ranch came complete with 265 head of cattle for 72 Guatemalan refugee families who returned in March after 15 years in exile in Mexico.</p>
<p>But without horses, saddles, fence material or vaccines, the returnees cannot run a ranch on the land they selected, which the government financed for them under a refugee repatriation programme. Entre Rios (Spanish for Between Rivers) has no electricity, plastic sheets on poles serve as houses and there is no road to export cattle out of this desolate, deforested lowland in the remote department of Peten.</p>
<p>About 17,000 refugees have returned to Guatemala since 1990 after fleeing violence and destroyed villages at the height of the Guatemalan army's counterinsurgency campaigns in the early 1980s. But life back in Guatemala is often harder than it was in camps in southern Mexico, where many refugees had houses and jobs if not land of their own.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no development projects, no production projects, no infrastructure, not even a road in some places,&quot; said Rubio Mejia of the board of the Permanent Commissions that represents most of the refugees. The government has invested $68 million in land for resettlement.</p>
<p>&quot;The communities think having a piece of land is the only instrument that benefits them,&quot; said Jose Luis Gandara, director of the government's Commission for Attention to Repatriated, Refugees and Displaced (CEAR in Spanish).</p>
<p>But programmes to make the land productive &quot;have been a total failure,&quot; according to Alvaro Colom Caballeros, executive director of the government's National Peace Fund, which finances land for refugees.</p>
<p>If land is only a partial answer for tens of thousands of returning refugees, the government faces an even larger challenge when hundreds of thousands of internally displaced peasants seek government aid under new peace agreements.</p>
<p>The government and leftist rebels are expected to sign in September an accord putting a definitive end to the 36-year civil war that has killed more than 100,000 Guatemalans, mostly indigenous peasants. Under the accord, internally displaced people can make demands for housing, infrastructure, jobs and other resources. Money to resettle displaced people is the largest item in the government's tentative budget to fulfil peace accords -- $617 million out of $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>There just will not be enough money to buy land for all the displaced, said CEAR's Gandara, and funds are better used to develop jobs and production. The government may refuse to buy land for the internally displaced but under a 1992 agreement they must finance land purchases for returning refugees. The returnees have a right to choose where they will live but they usually cannot return to their old lands, which the army destroyed or took over.</p>
<p>The refugee's Permanent Commissions constantly protest the government's snail's pace in buying land. Colom said negotiations to buy land were lengthy partly because it was hard to find a fair deal. Landowners jack up prices when they find out the the government is buying the land.</p>
<p>Another problem, Colom said, is that the government buys land for families that do not return. The government bought the Entre Rios land for 225 families but 153 of the refugee families did not fulfil their agreement to settle there.</p>
<p>Although an estimated 25,000 refugees including children born in Mexico still live in Chiapas, Campeche and Quintana Roo there, the flow of returnees to Guatemala is slowing from 9,500 in 1995 to only 2,700 so far in 1996. Many are deciding to stay in the country where they raised their children, and the Mexican government has indicated it may allow permanent residency for refugees.</p>
<p>Fear has also stemmed the flow of returnees. Last October, soldiers killed 11 people in a returnees community during a confusing confrontation in the highlands. The so-called Xaman massacre had a direct effect on a scheduled return the next month to La Lupita, a settlement on the southwestern Pacific coast where only 74 of 236 families ended up returning.</p>
<p>The returnees at La Lupita do not think the land could really support 236 families anyway. They are asking the government to re-survey the land, which they claim has swampy areas that are no good for cattle or crops.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest problem we have now are the payments for the land,&quot; said returnee Dolores Vasquez. &quot;We don't even have anywhere to make money because our husbands are working on the first projects on the land. They can't go out to get jobs to make money.&quot;</p>
