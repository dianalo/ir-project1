<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Thursday he was concerned about a deterioration in relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>In a two-page letter Kohl told Rafsanjani German courts were independent and that the government had absolutely no control over or involvement in the so-called &quot;Mykonos trial&quot; taking place in Berlin.</p>
<p>Relations between Iran and Germany have become strained since German prosecutors demanded life sentences for an Iranian and a Lebanese on trial for the 1992 killing of three Kurdish dissidents in Berlin. Prosecutors last week accused Tehran of ordering the murders.</p>
<p>The accusations have provoked outrage in Iran. Protesters have rallied outside the German embassy in Tehran, pelting the compound with eggs and tomatoes and calling for the death of the prosecutors.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past few days I have been witnessing with worry and concern the trend in relations between the two states, especially its reflection in the press,&quot; Kohl wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;With such a trend, it is unfortunately possible that the long-term and friendly bilateral ties will suffer.&quot;</p>
<p>Kohl assured Rafsanjani that the trial in Berlin was not &quot;a political trial&quot;, but a criminal trial.</p>
<p>&quot;The courts in Germany are independent,&quot; Kohl said. &quot;This is not only the case for judgments, but also how the case is to be prosecuted. In the fight against terrorism, our courts are ruthless when it comes to their efforts to find the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>Iranian state television said Kohl had assured Tehran that the terrorism charges were not meant to offend Iran.</p>
<p>But in the letter, a copy of which was released by the Chancellery in Bonn, there was no mention of the word &quot;offence&quot; or the slightest hint of an apology.</p>
<p>&quot;It is in the interest of our two peoples that a further deterioration of the currently tense relations with Iran be avoided,&quot; Kohl wrote. &quot;I would thus ask you to use your entire influence to avoid a further increase in tensions.&quot;</p>
<p>A member of Kohl's cabinet, Development Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger, criticised Iran.</p>
<p>&quot;Iran's state terrorism against those who think differently has once again become visible as a result of this trial,&quot; he said. &quot;The death threats against representatives of the German justice system are intolerable and show how the Tehran regime tramples on human rights.&quot;</p>
<p>After a briefing to the cabinet in Bonn earlier on Thursday by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, ministers agreed to keep a &quot;cool head&quot;, a government spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was emphasised again that the important thing for us in what is certainly a somewhat difficult phase of German-Iranian relations is a policy of keeping a cool head,&quot; government spokesman Peter Hausmann said after the cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>Hausmann said the policy was unchanged although Kinkel now preferred the term &quot;exerting active influence&quot; to &quot;critical dialogue&quot;.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry said it had asked Tehran about media reports that a gathering of clerics in the holy city of Qom had passed a resolution on Wednesday comparing the prosecutors' &quot;insults&quot; to those in Salman Rushdie's &quot;Satanic Verses&quot;.</p>
