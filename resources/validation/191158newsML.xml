<headline>Judge to mull $86.8 mln airline-travel agent pact.</headline>

<p>A federal judge said Friday he was still considering a settlement under which six of the nation's largest airlines would pay $86.8 million to travel agents who say the airlines conspired to cap commissions.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge James Rosenbaum has already granted preliminary approval to the settlement. Of the 36,751 potential class members that received notice of the settlement, 134 wrote back to object that the settlement does not prohibit the airlines from continuing the cap, according to court documents. Less than 15 others objections were made over the amount of the settlement or the method of allocation.  </p>
<p>No date for Rosenbaum's final ruling was set.</p>
<p>Under terms of the settlement, AMR Corp's American Airlines would pay $21.3 million; Continental Airlines would pay $5 million; Delta Air Lines Inc would pay $20.3 million; Northwest Airlines Corp would pay $10.9 million; UAL Corp's United Airlines would pay $19.5 million and USAir Group Inc's USAir would pay $9.8 million.</p>
<p>Trans World Airlines Inc has also settled, but a dollar amount had not been determined as of recent court papers. A TWA spokesman could not be reached for comment Friday.</p>
<p>The settlement comes in a class action lawsuit filed in 1995 alleging the airlines conspired to unfairly cap travel agent commissions at $25 for one-way plan tickets and $50 for roun-trip tickets.</p>
<p>Of the $86.8 million, $28.9 million would be paid in attorney fees.</p>
