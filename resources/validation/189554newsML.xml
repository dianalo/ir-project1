<p>Rigid labour laws may contribute to the European Union's high unemployment rate, but they are by no means the only culprit, according to a controversial European Commission report released on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Evidence suggests that...labour market regulation may affect the level of employment creation or at least the speed with which firms adjust their labour force in response to change,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>However, it added, labour market flexibility is influenced by a range of other factors such as access to product markets, the internal organisation of companies, availability of housing, company pension plans and worker attitudes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it said, deregulation of labour markets can lead to even more costly and uncertain regulation by the courts.</p>
<p>The report, an internal working paper* issued in the wake of a court ruling that upheld an EU law limiting the work week to 48 hours, became controversial when press reports accused the Commission of planning to suppress graphs showing a link between unemployment and strict social legislation.</p>
<p>The Commission denied the reports last week, saying it had decided not to include the graphs only because they showed a weak correlation.</p>
<p>Commission President Jacques Santer made it clear on Thursday that the Commission would continue to support labour laws such as the EU's Working Time Directive, which Britain unsuccessfully challenged in the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, we need more flexible labour markets but not a return to the Dickensian sweatshops of the 19th century,&quot; he told a business conference. &quot;Those who seem to say the less social regulation, the better it is for (competitiveness) -- do they mean no regulation at all?&quot;</p>
<p>The Commission paper highlights a variety of weaknesses in the EU economy, especially high joblessness and slow economic growth. It noted that the EU's standard of living in 1995 was one-fourth lower than that of the United States.</p>
<p>It added that only 59 percent of the EU's working-age population held jobs in 1995 -- compared with 73 percent in the United States and 74 percent in Japan.</p>
<p>In an analysis of the impact of labour rules on matters such as unfair dismissals, layoffs and severance payments, it said that EU states with more regulated markets had somewhat lower employment rates than those with less regulation.</p>
<p>&quot;An excessively high level of protection against dismissal can be seen as a significant obstacle to new recruitment,&quot; it said, although it noted that the increasing use of fixed-term contracts had weakened the impact.</p>
<p>It said Europeans worked fewer hours each year than their U.S. or Japanese counterparts -- an average of 1,644 in 1992, compared with 1,940 and 2,120. But it said labour inflexibility was related more to the way work was carried out -- for example, restrictions on shop hours -- and the attitudes of workers.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent surveys conclude that 38 percent of firms surveyed in five European countries have experienced difficulties in finding workers for Saturday work,&quot; it added.</p>
