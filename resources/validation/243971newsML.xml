<p>Trading on Dhaka Stock Exchange was suspended for a second day on Monday as hundreds of investors, angered by losses due to a lingering market bearishness, continued their demonstration.</p>
<p>&quot;Unceratinty has gripped the capital market as the small investors continued to agitate despite the government's efforts to bring back confidence,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Finance Minister S.A.M.S. Kibria on Sunday asked the state-owned Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB) to extend support to the market and prevent any further slide.  </p>
<p>&quot;Nobody could turn up for trading,&quot; said a securityman at the DSE building. &quot;I don't know when the deadlock will be over,&quot; said another broker.</p>
<p>&quot;We are ready to operate, but could not enter the building,&quot; the broker said.</p>
<p>The DSE all share price index closed 48.8 points or 1.83 percent down at 2,618.3 on Saturday. Friday is the weekend in Moslem Bangladesh.</p>
