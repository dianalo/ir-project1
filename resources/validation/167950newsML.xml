<p>Indonesian palm olein prices edged lower in late trading on Tuesday as buying interest continued to wane in the wake of weak Malaysian values, traders said.</p>
<p>They said olein was around 1,360-65 rupiah/kg in Jakarta, down from 1,365-70 rupiah at the opening. Crude palm oil was done at 1,170 rupiah/kg at a tender in the North Sumatran city of Medan, unchanged from the last tender price.</p>
<p>&quot;Buyers were mostly sidelined because of a weakening in prices in Malaysia,&quot; one trader said. &quot;Buyers preferred to wait and see if local prices will go lower.&quot;  </p>
<p>Traders also said they were keeping an eye on developments in Pakistan following the dismissal of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her three-year-old government.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be extra cautious when dealing with private Pakistani buyers because problems over payments could arise if there is unrest there,&quot; one senior trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;If for instance there are riots, buyers could declare a force majeure and the situation could become sticky as far as payments are concerned,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Traders in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore said they too were following developments, but expected nothing dramatic.  </p>
<p>Local traders said they were waiting for the government's announcement of November export taxes for crude palm oil and three products which was expected this week.</p>
<p>They said they expected the tax on palm olein to be around $19/tonne against $30 in October and around $28 for crude palm oil, down from $35.28 last month.</p>
<p>Data from Belawan Port showed that 3,100 tonnes of olein was scheduled to leave the North Sumatran port on Wednesday for Bombay on board the MT Rossa. The MT Prabu will leave for Jakarta tomorrow with 2,000 tonnes of olein, along with the MT Mutiara with 1,900 tonnes of olein also bound for Jakarta.</p>
