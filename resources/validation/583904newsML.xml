<p>A federal judge in Michigan Tuesday ordered part of the 10,000-member class action lawsuit against companies associated with silicone breast implants moved to Detroit. (Corrects to clarify that only a section of the case was moved.)</p>
<p>The first phase of the case, a trial in which 1,700 Louisiana women are suing Dow Chemical Co. for its alleged role in testing the safety of silicone, started nine weeks ago.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' attorney Dawn Barrios told Reuters late Tuesday that U.S. District Judge Denise Page Hood of Detroit, who ordered the case moved, will hold an emergency hearing May 19 to decide if the Louisiana case will be allowed to continue separately.</p>
<p>&quot;We're very confident that the trial here will resume,&quot; plaintiffs' attorney Dawn Barrios told Reuters Tuesday. &quot;We've been to the state court of appeals over 30 times, the Louisiana Supreme Court 10 to 15 times, and federal district court here twice and both of those times it was sent back to state court for trial.&quot;</p>
<p>Dow Chemical Co. spokesman John Musser said late Tuesday that the company has not been notified of the emergency hearing. He said Hood's order Tuesday set a status conference on breast implant cases for June 27. &quot;We expect the judge to dismiss the jury when we go back to court Tuesday.&quot;</p>
<p>Last week, the federal 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that about 14,000 breast implant cases naming Dow Chemical as a defendant should be consolidated in U.S. District Court in Detroit.</p>
<p>Dow Chemical, based in Midland, Mich., owns 50 percent of Dow Corning Inc., once the nation's largest manufacturer of silicone-gel breast implants. The consolidation ruling also applies to Dow Corning's other shareholder, Corning Inc, which has been named in far fewer lawsuits.</p>
<p>The decision by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati could save Dow Chemical from fighting costly legal battles in courts across the country.</p>
<p>Dow Chemical did not make silicone for the implants, although it says it did conduct unrelated silicone tests on industrial worker safety in the 1940s and '50s for the Dow Corning venture.</p>
<p>Since Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection two years ago -- freezing litigation against it -- many women have pursued breast implant-related health claims against Dow Chemical.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of women have claimed that their silicone-gel breast implants are responsible for various health problems, including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>An estimated one million American woman have received breast implants, about 80 percent of them for cosmetic reasons.</p>
