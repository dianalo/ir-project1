<p>British finance minister  Gordon Brown on Thursday defended Labour's first budget in 18 years against criticism he had targeted pensioners as the stock market first fell sharply, then rallied.</p>
<p>Brown basked in praise from newspapers for Wednesday's &quot;budget for the people&quot;, designed to fulfil Labour's election pledges to get the unemployed back to work and lay the foundations of steady growth over the long term.</p>
<p>Shares began sharply lower as traders focussed on the view that Brown did not tighten fiscal policy enough to curb Britain's booming economy, raising the prospect of a rise in interest rates next week to cool consumer demand.</p>
<p>Prices then rallied as the conviction took hold that the budget held no major shocks for industry, despite Brown hitting utilities with a stinging windfall tax.</p>
<p>Sterling was firm, holding steady just below five-year highs of 2.9340 marks and $1.6785 on the belief interest rates would have to rise.</p>
<p>A key move in Brown's budget -- which reduced the government's deficit while offering incentives for business -- was a cut in tax credits for institutional investors like pension funds on dividend payouts.</p>
<p>The Conservatives, routed in Labour's May 1 election landslide, seized on the move, saying it would hit pensioners in the years to come.</p>
<p>The main opposition party said individuals would have to make higher pension contributions and local authorities would have to increase local taxes to make up pension shortfalls.</p>
<p>But Brown was dismissive. &quot;We are not raiding pensions, that is just ridiculous. The Tories (Conservatives) are getting increasingly desperate,&quot; he told a BBC interviewer.</p>
<p>Saying pension funds currently had large surpluses, he added: &quot;Pensioners, in my view, will not lose out over this in the way that people are suggesting.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown said his budget had shown he was prepared to take tough measures to cool down the economy and set the path for long-term stability and growth.</p>
<p>&quot;I've got the right balance. I've had to cool the economy down. Inflation was set to rise when I came into office. The previous government hadn't taken the action necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>But financial analysts were convinced that the Bank of England would raise interest rates by at least 0.25 percentage point next week from 6.50 percent. Rates have been increased twice since Labour won the election.</p>
<p>Not all Brown's political opponents were critical.</p>
<p>Former Conservative finance minister  Norman Lamont told the Times newspaper it was &quot;quite a careful budget&quot;.</p>
<p>The media focussed on Brown's decision to raid the government's emergency reserves to provide 3.5 billion pounds ($5.80 billion) for hospitals and schools, a move that went down well with left-wingers in the Labour party.</p>
<p>Comparing Brown to the chart-topping Spice Girls rock craze, the mass-selling Sun's front-page headline trumpeted: &quot;Spice one, Gord. Brown gives us what we really, really wanted.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown also announced a 4.8 billion pound one-off tax on utility companies to fund a &quot;welfare to work&quot; scheme to help jobless youths and single parents.</p>
<p>The moves meant that Brown was able to apply a modest brake on Britain's booming economy, which experts had seen as essential to ward off inflationary pressures, without a major immediate effect on the consumers who voted Labour into office.</p>
<p>Accountants Price Waterhouse said initial calculations suggested an average British family would be just 89 pounds ($147) a year worse off as a result of it, mainly because Brown cut tax relief on interest paid on loans for house purchase.</p>
<p>But pundits said the middle classes -- the key to Labour's May 1 election victory -- could live with this.</p>
<p>In its editorial the Daily Mail, fiercely anti-Labour in the election campaign and before, said: &quot;Brown has made an impressive debut...This one didn't soak the rich, didn't hit the middle classes, didn't bash business.</p>
<p>&quot;Truly there is something Tory (Conservative) about this first Labour budget for a generation.&quot; ($1=.6036 Pound)</p>
