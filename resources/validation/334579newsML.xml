<p>Thousands of pro-democracy student demonstrators swept triumphantly through central Belgrade early on Monday after Serbian riot police lifted a cordon that had prevented them from marching for over a week.</p>
<p>&quot;This is our great victory...I feel glorious and victorious,&quot; said student Djordjevic Podorovic.</p>
<p>About 10,000 people marched through the streets before dawn, blowing whistles and chanting slogans.</p>
<p>Hundreds of riot police, who set up the cordon along Kolarceva street in the city centre on January 19, withdrew at about 4 a.m. (0300 GMT).</p>
<p>The withdrawal came just hours before a march called by the Serbian Orthodox church that was expected to draw hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators who have been protesting against election fraud for more than two months.</p>
<p>After the police left, thousands of people swarmed into the streets to join the marching students.</p>
<p>There were shouts of &quot;Let's go for a walk&quot; and &quot;Let's go to Dedinje&quot; -- a reference to the Belgrade neighbourhood where President Slobodan Milosevic lives.</p>
<p>At the head of one column, marchers carried two Serbian flags, a statue of Jesus Christ and a candle.</p>
<p>The peaceful atmosphere was in contrast to the clashes that have erupted between students and police in the past few days as tempers flared after 10 weeks of protests.</p>
<p>Some traffic police moved onto the pavements to let the students pass, witnesses said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am speechless, this is incredible,&quot; said one student who gave his name as Aca.</p>
<p>&quot;You should have seen the moment when we reached the territory that had been held by the police. People were lying down and jumping up and down. It was just incredible.&quot;</p>
<p>The police withdrawal marked a major concession by the Socialist authorities. Milosevic's government has largely ignored demands by the students and the opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition to reinstate annulled local election results last November.</p>
<p>The students, demonstrating 24-hours a day in the bitter cold of the Balkan winter, have kept up their spirits with speeches, dancing to rock music, and by playing stunts such as getting women colleagues to kiss the policemen.</p>
<p>On Sunday, riot police charged protesters to force them onto pavements in central Belgrade. The demonstrators ran from the police cordon and no major violence was reported.</p>
<p>About 100 youths later turned over rubbish containers in Nikola Pasic square, threw garbage towards police and blocked the entrance to a traffic tunnel. Police kept their distance and the crowd began to disperse by midnight.</p>
<p>The Orthodox church, which backed Serbian nationalist war aims during the Yugoslav conflict, stayed silent for weeks while protests swept Serbia's cities to try to force the ruling Socialists to concede defeat in the November municipal elections.</p>
<p>But Patriarch Pavle, who blessed student protesters at a rally last week, said he would lead his flock along Kolarceva Street to St Sava Cathedral starting at 7.30 a.m. (0630 GMT).</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters joined a procession led by the patriarch on Orthodox Christmas Eve three weeks ago. Police relaxed an edict against street marches for the occasion and no violence was reported.</p>
<p>The opposition also planned a march later in the day to include a tour of the city's churches.</p>
<p>Since Thursday the Socialists had loosened the leash on riot police wearied by round-the-clock duty in the winter cold.</p>
<p>The police pummelled protesters, including women and children, blocking roads in several cities. Seven seven people were injured in an attack on demonstrators sitting on a highway outside the provincial city of Kragujevac.</p>
<p>Opposition leaders told a rally on Sunday police beatings would fail to defuse popular discontent against Milosevic's authoritarian rule.</p>
<p>&quot;Our dictator is now reduced to two pillars of power -- his (police) cordons and his factory of lies, his TV,&quot; Vesna Pesic, a Zajedno leader, told the crowd.</p>
<p>The daily protests pose the biggest threat to 50 years of unbroken communist and socialist rule in Serbia but some analysts fear the demonstrations could degenerate into bloody violence.</p>
