<headline>France outlaws asbestos from January 1.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>The French government on Thursday put into law a ban on asbestos in new buildings from January 1, becoming one of the last industrial nations to do so.</p>
<p>The ban, published in France's official gazette, prevents the manufacture, import or export of virtually all kinds of asbestos but is especially aimed at fire-proof asbestos cement.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a general prohibition, whatever type of asbestos is involved,&quot; the social affairs ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Exceptions will be made until 2002 in very limited areas where asbestos is considered indispensible, it said.</p>
<p>France has until now imported 35,000 tonnes of asbestos a year. Up to 95 percent of that is used in the building industry.</p>
<p>Labour Minister Jacques Barrot announced plans to ban asbestos from January six months ago after a report found 2,000 people would die in France from contact with it this year.</p>
<p>Most other industrialised nations have long banned asbestos, linked by scientists to lung cancers and other lethal ailments.</p>
<p>But efforts to remove leaking asbestos from buildings have been both costly and frustrating, as exposure caused by the removal process itself has at times been found to be at least as dangerous to human health as the substance's initial presence.</p>
<p>The social affairs ministry said France was the eighth country in the 15-nation European Union to ban asbestos but that it now had the tightest legal framework in Europe.</p>
<p>Asbestos was commonly used as an insulation material in the construction industry until the 1970s, when it fell out of favour due to mounting evidence of its toxicity.</p>
<p>The ban presents a mixed outlook for the building industry.</p>
<p>Industry officials said when Barrot announced the ban in July that it would devastate 14 firms with 3,000 employees.</p>
<p>But shares in construction specialist GTM-Entrepose and smaller waste disposal firm SITA rose after the July announcement on hopes they would win contracts to clean up sites where asbestos had been used.</p>
