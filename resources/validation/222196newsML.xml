<p>Yannick Noah says his French Davis Cup team has come to spoil Stefan Edberg's party, but the twice Wimbledon champion is not afraid of gatecrashers.</p>
<p>Edberg, who retires after this weekend's Davis Cup final, said he was feeling completely relaxed.</p>
<p>&quot;It's great to be part of the team,&quot; Edberg, who has four Davis Cup triumphs to his name already, said. &quot;It takes a lot of pressure off my shoulders because I am not on my own here.&quot;</p>
<p>The 30-year-old Swede, who made an emotional exit from the tennis circuit at the Stockholm Open earlier this month, smiled and joked with his team mates following Thursday's draw.</p>
<p>&quot;I know if I was not able to win my match we could still take the Cup,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Edberg was drawn to meet France's top player, Cedric Pioline, in the first match of the final on Friday. He finishes the tournament in the second reverse singles on Sunday against Arnaud Boetsch.</p>
<p>Considered a gentleman of tennis, Edberg turned professional in 1983 and was the world's top-ranked player in 1990 and 1991.</p>
<p>A consummate serve and volleyer, he also won the Australian and U.S. Opens twice, though he was never really happy on Roland Garros's slow clay.</p>
<p>Unlike some of his volatile predecessors and successors the Swede was unfailingly courteous and well-behaved on and off the court.</p>
<p>He has set up a foundation to promote and coach young Swedish players and plans to spend time working with that as well devoting himself to his family.</p>
<p>Thomas Enqvist, Sweden's other singles player here, is rapidly slipping into Edberg's shoes. He won the Stockholm Open hard on the heels of victory at the Paris Open and has risen to ninth in the world rankings.</p>
<p>But he said he would not be alone in flying the Swedish tennis flag.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a lot of young players coming up . I don't feel I am the only one who has to do well next year. When Stefan retires we can continue the good Swedish tradtion,&quot; Enqvist, 22, said.</p>
<p>Noah, who played Edberg many times, said his team would not be swayed be sentiment when they met Edberg.</p>
<p>&quot;We all respect Stefan very much&quot; he said. &quot;He is a class player and always fair -- a role model for a lot of people.</p>
<p>&quot;If he had held a party at his place, we would have gone and we would have enjoyed it. But he decided to have a party here and we are going to spoil that for him.&quot;</p>
