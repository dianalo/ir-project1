<p>Indonesian aluminium purchases have risen sharply recently while Chinese copper buyers are waiting on the sidelines for a dip in current high copper prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME), traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Indonesian buying of aluminium is running at a good pace,&quot; an aluminium dealer for a Singapore-based commodity house said, adding the purchases had picked-up steam after companies found their stocks were running low.</p>
<p>One major Indonesian company recently bought up to 5,000 tonnes of aluminium in the last two weeks.  </p>
<p>&quot;They never anticipated they would need that much aluminium,&quot; a trader said. &quot;They're buying now to rebuild their stocks of the metal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the short-term, their demand for aluminium has firmed. The Indonesians did not enter into many long-term contracts because they thought premiums would come down. Some of them found themselves a bit short as a result,&quot; a dealer for a major European metal trading company added.</p>
<p>Premiums of western grade 20-25 kg aluminium ingots have climbed in the past month by U$5-$10 to $90-$95 a tonne CIF Jakarta, Singapore dealers said.  </p>
<p>Aluminium premiums in Singapore were seen at around $65-$83 a tonne, they said.</p>
<p>Aluminium demand in Taiwan remains steady while the trade was divided about the level of activity in Japan.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very quiet now in Japan,&quot; an aluminium dealer for a Japanese trading house said. &quot;There's not much spot business going on.&quot;</p>
<p>But another European trader said reports that aluminium demand in Japan had died down were deceptive since premiums for the second quarter remain buoyant at around the mid-$80 a tonne level over cash LME prices.  </p>
<p>&quot;The premiums would not be that firm if demand is not there,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>China was also seen engaged in small-lot aluminium buying, but was not much of a factor in the market.</p>
<p>The Chinese have also shied away from the copper market and are waiting for a correction in LME prices before going in, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese are not buying,&quot; Vinod Kumar, managing director of Singapore metal company Donald Mcarthy, said, adding his firm recently held discussions with potential buyers in China. &quot;Nobody seems interested in these prices.&quot;  </p>
<p>Kumar said Chinese interest in copper will only perk up once prices fall below $2,400 a tonne.</p>
<p>A trader for a Japanese metal dealing company said the Chinese will stay out of the market unless prices come off.</p>
<p>&quot;It does not make sense for them to come in at this level,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>Three-month copper prices were quoted by regional traders at around $2,400/05 a tonne at 0330 GMT, a shade firmer from the late LME quote on Thursday of $2,398/402 a tonne.</p>
<p>Spot business for the other base metals in the region remained stagnant, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Kumar said business has slowed down &quot;to a trickle. It's not exciting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing spectacular going on,&quot; a dealer for a European metal house said. &quot;We heard a few inquiries and I imagine they're from China. But it's pretty much stagnant.&quot;</p>
<p>Singapore metal dealers said prices in the LME will be looking to the stocks report due out at 0900 GMT on Friday for leads in the market.</p>
<p>Traders here expect copper inventories to decline between 2,000-5,000 tonnes while aluminium stocks are seen falling by about 5,000-10,000 tonnes.  </p>
<p>A fall in aluminium stocks may spur three-month metal for a fresh try at the $1,700 level after a kerb close on the LME yesterday of $1,689 a tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;It will try for $1,700 again,&quot; a Japanese trader said.</p>
