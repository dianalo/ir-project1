<title>SOUTH AFRICA: Industrials drive S.African stocks up, golds dip.</title>
<headline>Industrials drive S.African stocks up, golds dip.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG</dateline>
<text>
<p>A runaway industrials sector pushed South African shares higher on Friday as the market started to recover from its battering of the last two weeks and shrugged off a sickly golds index.</p>
<p>Futures traders waded into the market to snap up baskets of shares and drove the industrial index up. Prices drifted down in the afternoon as futures trade faded away, but a late rally ensured the market finished firmly up.</p>
<p>&quot;The market opened up strongly and then we had another rally in the last half an hour. It was like a breath of fresh air after recent weeks,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said futures players remained out of the market at the end. Instead the late surge had been sparked by a stronger rand and Wall Street's seemingly unstoppable bull run that gave a positive shot in the arm to the market's battered sentiment.</p>
<p>The industrial index jumped 68.1 points to end at 8,048.3 and pulled the all-share index up 26.5 points to 6,842.7.</p>
<p>There was some foreign buying in the market and local institutions were also in the hunt for shares as trading volumes hit healthy levels.</p>
<p>However, gold shares took a hammering as the bullion price slipped overnight in New York. A temporary halt in Hong Kong provided brief relief before European markets opened and the fall resumed.</p>
<p>The gold index dipped 22.7 points, or 1.3 percent,to 1,720.9.</p>
