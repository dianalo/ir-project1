<p>A senior member of Turkey's narcotics police on Sunday defended the country's record in the anti-drugs fight after Western criticism that Ankara is not doing enough to halt the flow of heroin to Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;Turkey is not a drug depot as they (Europeans) claim, but a shield for Europe,&quot; Ismail Caliskan, deputy head of the department of organised crime and smuggling, told Anatolian news agency.</p>
<p>Turkey is a key transit point to Europe for drugs, mostly heroin from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. He said other countries on the smugglers' &quot;Balkan route&quot; to Western Europe did not do as much as Turkey to fight drug trafficking.</p>
<p>&quot;Turkey spends $30 million each year in the struggle against drug smuggling...There are other countries after Turkey, why they do not take measures on their own borders?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Caliskan said 4.5 tonnes of the seven tonnes of heroin seized in Europe last year was captured by Turkish police, according to the Interpol figures.</p>
<p>Anti-drugs officials in Western Europe have recently urged Turkey to make a greater effort against the drugs trade.</p>
