<p>Scores of sweaty Santas linked hands to dance round a Christmas tree under a sweltering summer sun in Copenhagen's Town Hall Square on Tuesday at the start of Denmark's 34th annual Father Christmas World Congress.</p>
<p>More than 100 Santas from 10 nations have gathered in the Danish capital for the four-day off-season jamboree.</p>
<p>Earlier the red-robed, white-bearded Santas, accompanied by hordes of elves and a convoy of veteran red fire engines, ho-hoed through central Copenhagen, tossing sweets to children and showering unsuspecting tourists with traditional yuletide greetings.</p>
<p>Once in the square, the costumed men and women danced and sang Christmas carols to the strains of their own brass band, before adjourning to a nearby hostelry to quaff Danish yule ale and sample traditional Christmas pastries.</p>
<p>As usual politics dominate this year's congress and the hottest item on the agenda is how to ensure that it is only bone fide Father Christmases who entertain children in the festive season.</p>
<p>Before they even arrived in Copenhagen for this week's congress, the authorised delegates had been upstaged by a breakaway group of renegade Nordic Santas who held a rival gathering in a Danish provincial town in early July.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a grave danger that children's illusions could be ruined if a mass of fake Santas suddenly turn up on the Father Christmas circuit,&quot; said congress chairman Kurt Flemming, who doubles as a circus clown outside the Christmas season.</p>
<p>The Santa fraternity has also been dogged in recent years over which Nordic country is the true home of Father Christmas.</p>
<p>Greenland laid claim to the title, but Finnish Lapland, Sweden, Norway and Iceland all put in rival bids until agreeing to differ and concentrate on how best to do the job.</p>
<p>This week's programme has drawn delegates from Australia, Britain, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Scandinavia and the United States.</p>
