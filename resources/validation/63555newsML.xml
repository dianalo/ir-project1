<p>Analysts raised a toast on Thursday to South African Breweries Ltd's plan to tap the market for up to some two billion rand to finance the drinks giant's burgeoning overses expansion.</p>
<p>In a brief statement the group said it would explore the possibility of issuing for cash ordinary shares worth up to five percent of the existing issued ordinary and automatically convertible preference shares.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue will be received very positively. SAB is a highly rated company,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>Another commented: &quot;I don't think they will have problems getting the shares away. SAB has been one of the most internationally traded (South African) shares.&quot;</p>
<p>They speculated that it would be pitched at or slightly below its current share price of 131.75 rand, unmoved at 0900 GMT. The market expects SAB to raise at least 1.5 billion rand and possibly the full two billion.</p>
<p>Analysts said the cash would likely be used to fund the expansion of the group's beer arm, not its smaller hotels or retail divisions.</p>
<p>SAB, with brand names like Castle and Lion, dominates its home beer market with a 97 percent market share. In order to grow, it has expanded rapidly into other African states and further afield into Europe and China.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no way that, in the medium to long-term, South Africa would be able to sustain the type of growth SAB has seen recently. They have to go overseas to get that,&quot; said Zelda Zaayman, analyst at Silvis, Barnard, Jacobs, Mellet &amp; Co.</p>
<p>SAB has bought controlling stakes in the state breweries of Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique and is negotiating to buy Angola's. It has also established itself Hungary, Romania and, most recently, Poland.</p>
<p>Further afield the firm has 55 percent of the Shenyang brewery in north east China.</p>
<p>Analysts said SAB would probably use the cash in a mixture of activities, combining new ventures with reinforcing existing plants. &quot;It most likely will be a combination of acquisition and investment in existing opportunities,&quot; said Tom de Trafford, analyst at Simpson McKie.</p>
<p>Analysts said it was unlikely SAB would seek to enter new markets, such as Latin America, and would instead build on extending its already existing base in central and eastern Europe and China.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we will probably see more of the same in places where they they have already built up a presence,&quot; de Trafford said.</p>
<p>Analysts were split as to exactly where the emphasis of the new investment would be. Zaayman said the firm would seek to expand in Europe and, for the moment at least, keep a watching brief on investment in its Chinese operations.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect they will look at more breweries in Hungary, Romania and Poland...I don't think that in China they will be that aggressive in the short-term,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>In May, when SAB bought a 27.5 percent chunk of Polish brewer Lech Browary Wielkopolski, the firm said that it would see further investment opportunities in that country.</p>
<p>But another analyst said the firm may seek to plough a sizeable chunk of the cash into China, hoping to capitalise early on its massive market potential, despite the difficulties of a market where consumers have not traditionally drunk beer.</p>
<p>&quot;It's got fantastic growth,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Company officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
