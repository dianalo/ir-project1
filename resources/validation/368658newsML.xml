<p>U.S. seasonally adjusted retail sales rose 2.5 percent in the first week of fiscal February versus January, according to the Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan Inc Redbook Retail Sales Index.</p>
<p>The index rose 5.8 percent compared to the same month a year ago, the report said. Adjusted retail sales advanced 5.8 percent in the week ended February 8 compared with the same week a year ago, it said.  </p>
<p>Much of the early-February gains appeared to be built upon the strength of apparel sales, said Howard Eilenberg, a retail analyst at Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan.</p>
<p>&quot;Apparel is doing well, and that's encouraging,&quot; Eilenberg said in an interview with Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>In particular, higher-priced men's and women's clothing sold well, he said.</p>
<p>Chain and discount stores appeared to outperform department stores during the first week of the month, Eilenberg said. A snowstorm in the mid-Atlantic region may have depressed department store results, he said.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, February sales performance should cool somewhat but remain strong, and March looks like it will be in good shape, said Eilenberg.</p>
<p>&quot;Easter is a little earlier this year, so you're going to see a stronger March,&quot; he said.</p>
