<p>The latest UK data painted a more promising picture of Britain's trading performance and will help ease fears that the spirited economic recovery has had a damaging impact on the trade balance, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been concerns that the pick up in activity has had an adverse effect on the trade balance, but these figures should ease these fears,&quot; said Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC Markets.</p>
<p>The global trade deficit widened only marginally in June to 1.118 billion stg from 1.116 in May.  </p>
<p>The May deficit was revised upwards, however, from 985 million stg at the first estimate.</p>
<p>There was better news on the more up-to-date figures covering trade with countries outside the European Union. That deficit was chopped in half to 506 million stg in July from 1.09 billion in June.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures are plainly better than expected and do not suggest that the expected pick up on consumption this year is immediately translating into a sharply deteriorating balance of payments,&quot; said Warwick Lightfoot, treasury economist at Royal Bank of Scotland.  </p>
<p>Imports from the rest of the world grew just 0.5 percent in the second quarter while exports picked up by 2.0 percent.</p>
<p>Economic recovery in Britain's key trading partners means the outlook for exports is rosy, but subdued demand for imports may not last for long.</p>
<p>&quot;Imports appear to be suffering from the inventory overhang. UK firms are increasingly meeting demand from existing stocks rather than overseas orders,&quot; said Loynes.</p>
<p>&quot;But with signs the stock overhang could be unwound and the beginnings of a recovery in investment underway, import growth is set to pick up.&quot;  </p>
<p>Britain's trade balance is more vulnerable to an investment recovery than a consumer boom. Its industrial base was eroded during the 1980s and a pick up in investment will lead to an influx of capital goods from abroad.</p>
<p>The consumer recovery, on the other hand, may not pose such a threat to the trade balance.</p>
<p>Britain now plays host to a huge number of overseas consumer goods manufacturers and is expected to be a net exporter of televisions and passenger cars by the year 2000.  </p>
<p>But providing British firms retain their competitive position abroad, export growth could mostly offset growing imports.</p>
<p>Sales of goods to countries outside the EU are already on the up, rising 3.5 percent in the three months to July. And even in sluggish Europe exports are resilient. They fell 0.7 in the three months to June, but were up 1.3 percent month-on-month.</p>
<p>Some economists find Britain's export performance puzzling and do not rule out large-scale revisions in the months ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;The apparent buoyancy of of export growth is surprising,&quot; said Alex Garrard, UK economist at UBS.  </p>
<p>He said Britain's competitiveness was hampered by sterling's rally earlier this year, and the slow pick up in economic activity abroad and downbeat message from exporting firms in the latest CBI survey runs contrary to the official data.</p>
<p>&quot;Either the surveys are wrong and concentrating too much on large companies, or they are right and the recent export data will be revised downwards in coming months,&quot; said Garrard.</p>
