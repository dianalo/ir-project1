<title>CHILE: Chilean shares rise broadly on electrical buying.</title>

<p>Chilean shares closed broadly higher on local and foreign buying spurred by sentiment that electrical shares may have been punished too harshly by fears that a drought will cut into their earnings.</p>
<p>With rain clouds hanging over Santiago, analysts said drought worries may be overblown and the market may turn to fundamentals, such as first quarter results due out by the end of April and economic figures due Wednesdady or Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;In the short term, the drought is a problem, but the electrical companies have so many businesses and so many projects that the hit from the drought is going to be transitory,&quot; said Bice Corredores de Bolsa analyst Irma Staplefield. She said drought concerns were probably already factored enough into the share price on Endesa, Chile's biggest power distributor.</p>
<p>The blue-chip IPSA ended 0.61 percent higher at 117.42 points. The all-share IGPA ended 0.36 percent higher on light volume of 10 billion pesos traded.  </p>
<p>Rises included most major electrical concerns, although by modest margins, as investors moved cautiously back into the sector. Chilgener was up 0.6 percent to 168 pesos and Endesa was up one percent to 249.5 pesos.</p>
<p>Colbun, a hydroelectric dam operator and one of the most vulnerable companies to drought, ended unchanged at 34.50.</p>
<p>Other rises included Banco Edwards, up 1.5 percent to 50.75 pesos after reporting good first-quarter results. A Salomon Brothers report credited Banco Edwards with &quot;the most stable earnings of the (Chilean) banks we cover.&quot;  </p>
<p>Santa Rita rose 2.8 percent to 55.5 pesos following reports of stronger Chilean overseas wine demand and another major winery, San Pedro, owned by Cerveceras Unidas, rose sharply early in the day on strong volume, but backtracked and ended unchanged at 3.03 pesos.  Declines included Maderas y Sintticos, off 2.8 percent at 210 pesos, and foodmaker Iansa, off 2.2 percent at 76.25 pesos.</p>
<p>Brokers will be looking out for first quarter earnings to start filtering in next week. Earnings expectations are generally strong in the electrical sector, though largely due to monetary correction rather than new business, they said.</p>
