<p>The powerful Central Committee of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party met behind closed doors on Monday for talks on a range of issues which sources said would include possible leadership changes later this year.</p>
<p>Official media reports said the 170-strong committee would discuss public administration reform and how to select and train the right people to represent the party in all walks of life.</p>
<p>&quot;The...Central Committee is to hold its third plenum this year to discuss ways of building and consolidating the Vietnamese state and selecting personnel for the new period of industrialisation and modernisation,&quot; the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said.</p>
<p>The committee prepared for its meeting months in advance, sending out draft documents for discussion to senior officials and experts at central and local levels for comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>The party agreed at a landmark congress a year ago to tackle the failings of state management, especially the bureaucracy, which remain despite a decade of economic reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;State management of business has been loose, and despite improvements, multi-stop administrative procedures still exist,&quot; the Saigon Times Daily said in a report ahead of the plenum.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, land transfer paperwork must go through 19 gates in cities and eight in rural areas,&quot; it said. &quot;In the land, housing, electric power and water supply areas, there are currently more than 1,000 overlapping legal documents.&quot;</p>
<p>VNA's report on the agenda for the plenum made no mention of possible changes to the leadership triumvirate of party secretary general, president and prime minister -- which is a taboo subject in the tightly-controlled media.</p>
<p>However, political sources said it was certain that the posts of president and prime minister would be considered because their five-year terms come up for renewal by a new National Assembly, which will meet for the first time in September.</p>
<p>In theory, 76-year-old General Le Duc Anh and 74-year-old Vo Van Kiet could be reappointed president and prime minister respectively for another five years.</p>
<p>Anh, Kiet and Party Secretary General Do Muoi, 80, had been expected to step down at the 1996 congress, but last-minute manoeuvring saw their terms in office effectively extended.</p>
<p>However, Anh suffered a stroke in November and although he has recovered sufficiently to make some brief public appearances, analysts believe he will not stay on. Sources quote Kiet as saying he is tired and ready to go.</p>
<p>Whether Anh and Kiet stay or go will become clearer later this month, when the list of candidates for the July 20 elections to the National Assembly is published.</p>
<p>According to the constitution, the president and prime minister must be members of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expected Muoi, who is seen as a balancing influence between reform-minded Kiet and conservative Anh, to stay on until a mid-term party congress 18 months from now.</p>
