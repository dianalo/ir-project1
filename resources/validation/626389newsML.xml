<p>Latvian shares erased recent gains in sluggish trade on Friday as Daugavpils Chain's price fell steeply because it went ex-bonus, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Rietumu index lost 5.98 points to close at 181.24 (corrects closing price) and overall market volume was a paltry 40,000 lats.</p>
<p>Daugavpils Chain saw its price fall to 1.17 lats to 2.15 lats in trade of 7,600 lats.</p>
<p>&quot;We can basically say the price is the same as yesterday only adjusted to the bonus share issue volume,&quot; said Roberts Idelsons, head of Trasta Bank's securities department.</p>
<p>The company, a leading secondary list stock, earlier issued some seven million bonus shares or 84 shares per head.</p>
<p>&quot;The Daugavpils fall took the market by surprise, and may explain why things were so inactive today,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Another dealer said the listless mood was partly explained by the fact that it was the last trading session of the month and brokers were tidying their books.</p>
<p>Of the five shares on the official list, one was not quoted, two held steady and two eased.</p>
<p>Unibanka fell 6.8 percent to 3.31 lats in trade of 1,600 lats.</p>
<p>&quot;Unibanka rose a little too high and too fast...it should stabilise now,&quot; said one broker.</p>
