<p>The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday easily approved a $268.2 billion defense budget over White House objections to new B-2 Stealth bombers and to a June 1998 date to pull U.S. ground troops out of Bosnia.</p>
<p>Administration officials, including top military officers, have said they will recommend President Bill Clinton veto the defense bill if it reaches his desk with those two provisions. The Senate version is more acceptable, however, and a deal is likely to be struck before a confrontation on the issues.</p>
<p>The defense bill passed the House on a bipartisan vote of 304-210. In an unusual action, the House reversed itself and agreed to remove an amendment that sought to bar aid to Russia to help it dismantle nuclear weapons if it sends anti-ship &quot;Sunburn&quot; cruise missiles to China. The bill provides $285 million to destroy Russia's Cold War-era nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Both the House and Senate defense bills would spend $6.6 billion more than Clinton requested and are $3 billion larger than the 1997 budget. The Senate will vote next month.</p>
<p>The House rejected the advice of Defense Secretary William Cohen on Tuesday and voted to cut off funds for U.S. military operations in Bosnia June 30, 1998. Cohen and other military leaders have warned that a mandatory date to withdraw from the region would place U.S. troops in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Clinton has told Congress that U.S. participation in the Bosnia mission is on track to end by mid-June next year. But lawmakers said they wanted to force him to seek an extension from Congress if he decided the troops should remain longer.</p>
<p>House National Security Committee chairman Floyd Spence, a South Carolina Republican, argued the administration was guilty of &quot;broken promises&quot; on the Bosnia mission with earlier extensions of U.S. involvement.</p>
<p>The House also voted to restart production of radar-evading B-2 Stealth bombers despite protests by Cohen that the purchase of nine additional planes was expensive and unnecessary. The B-2 production start-up may not survive the legislative process, however, as the Senate version expressly bars purchase of additional B-2 aircraft.</p>
<p>Cohen said the Pentagon was unanimous in its view that &quot;the cost of further B-2 production cannot be justified.&quot; But supporters argued the funds would help maintain productive capacity of the defense industry and provide necessary fighting capability.</p>
<p>The black, delta-shaped B-2, which uses special &quot;stealth&quot; radar-evasion technology to penetrate enemy airspace undetected, was developed in the 1980s as a replacement for the aging B-1 fleet. The Pentagon bought 21 of the planes.</p>
<p>The House bill also transferred $2.6 billion from the Energy Department's budget for clean-up of toxic waste at military installations to an account for weapons purchases. The transfer is opposed by the White House.</p>
<p>One area in which they all agreed was a 2.8 percent pay raise for defense personnel in January.</p>
<p>The House also voted to bar burial with military honors for convicted bomber Timothy McVeigh, sentenced to die for the April 1995 bombing of a federal building that killed 168 in Oklahoma City. McVeigh served in the Gulf War.</p>
<p>The House defense bill authorized $2.1 billion as requested by the White House for continued development of the Air Force's F-22 fighter. It also would spend $1.3 billion for up to 12 F/A-18 E and F planes.</p>
