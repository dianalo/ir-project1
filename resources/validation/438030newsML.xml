<headline>NTT says to take steps on Nomura ties over scandal.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-03-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Japanese telecoms giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp said on Wednesday that it needs to take some measures regarding its business with Nomura Securities Co Ltd in light of the brokerage's suspected illegal transactions with a corporate client.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to take some counter measures, but at the moment we are waiting to see how things will develop,&quot; NTT president Junichiro Miyazu told a news conference, when asked whether the scandal will affect its business ties with the brokerage.  </p>
<p>Nomura is one of the leading underwriters for NTT's corporate bonds and stocks.</p>
<p>Earlier, Hiroshi Okuda, president of Toyota Motor Corp, was quoted by Jiji news agency as saying that the car maker was closely awaiting the results of a probe on Nomura by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC).</p>
<p>&quot;Depending on the outcome, we may need to review transactions (with Nomura),&quot; he was reported as saying.</p>
<p>Nomura is a lead manager for underwriting Toyota's corporate bonds and stocks.</p>
<p>A Toyota spokesman declined to confirm the president's remarks or comment on the company's position on the issue.</p>
<p>On Monday, two Nomura directors resigned after the brokerage firm said they made apparently illegal deals and funnelled funds to a corporate client which has linked by Japanese media to a former &quot;sokaiya&quot; racketeer.  </p>
<p>Major Japanese asset management firms, including Nomura's own unit Nomura Investment Management Co, have suspended business with Nomura Securities after the brokerage disclosed the suspected illegal deals.</p>
<p>Other major Nomura clients are nervously awaiting the outcome of the SESC's probe, but they have stopped short of saying they are considering suspending business with it.</p>
<p>A spokesman for NEC Corp said it would wait for further developments before taking any measures concerning its business dealings with Nomura.</p>
<p>A Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd spokesman also said the firm was closely watching the situation. Nomura is the lead-manager for its equities financing issue.</p>
<p>A Nissho Iwai Corp spokesman said: &quot;At this point, we are not considering changing the lead-manager for our equity financing from Nomura to other brokerages.&quot; In August last year, Nomura was the lead-manager for Nissho Iwai's convertible bond issue and new share issue, he said.</p>
<p>A Nippon Steel Corp spokesman also said the company has not yet considered any change in its ties with Nomura.</p>
