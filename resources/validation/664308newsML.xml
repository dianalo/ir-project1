<p>Turkey's pro-Western deputy prime minister, Tansu Ciller, said on Monday that her Islamist coalition partner, Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, would resign in the next couple of days.</p>
<p>&quot;In the next one or two days, the 54th government will come to an end, Erbakan will resign. In such an environment, the thing to do is to form an election government,&quot; she told a business group meeting.  </p>
<p>Erbakan and Ciller earlier announced they would swap jobs by the end of this month and form a caretaker government to go for early elections.</p>
<p>But the planned power transfer and early polls would have to overcome the serious obstacles of presidential and parliamentary approval. The coalition lacks a majority in the national assembly after a series of defections and resignations.</p>
<p>Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist leader, has been under intense pressure in recent months in army-led anti-Islamist crackdown. Ciller says she could ward off the army better than Erbakan if she were made prime minister.</p>
<p>Erbakan declined at a news conference on Monday to fix a date for the power handover despite persistent questions on when he would stand down.</p>
