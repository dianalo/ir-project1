<p>Ato Boldon, the self-proclaimed future of sprinting, matched performance to potential for the first time at a major championships on Friday by winning the world 200 title.</p>
<p>Boldon, desperately disappointed at finishing fifth in Sunday's 100 final after clocking 9.87 seconds in the second round, won by five metres from Namibia's 1993 champion Frankie Fredericks.</p>
<p>The Trinidadian was unhappy with his time of 20.04 seconds but elated with his victory.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to give the people something they would remember,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to succeed in sport. I want to be the future of sport.&quot;</p>
<p>Wilson Kipketer, an overwhelming favourite to retain the 800 metres title after equalling Seb Coe's 16-year-old world record last month, won as expected although he never threatened the world mark.</p>
<p>&quot;I was pretty certain I was going to get the gold,&quot; Kipketer said. &quot;I am fed up talking about the world record. I wanted to win the gold medal and the title.&quot;</p>
<p>The biggest surprise of the evening came in the women's 400 metres hurdles, expected to develop into a battle between the Olympic champion Deon Hemmings and the 1995 world champion and world record holder Kim Batten.</p>
<p>Instead Moroccan Nezha Bidouane emerged from the pack in a sizzling final 100 metres to win 13 years to the day after her compatriot Nawal el Moutawakel took the Olympic title in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&quot;I am the first woman to win a world title for Morocco and I am very proud,&quot; said Bidouane.</p>
<p>Ukrainian Zhanna Pintussevich took over from Merlene Ottey as the world 200 champion, as the 37-year-old Jamaican, finally showing her years, faded badly over the final few metres.</p>
<p>&quot;With 20 metres to go I started to realise I could win,&quot; said Pintussevich. &quot;And then I thought 'Oh no, this is not possible',&quot; Pintussevich, who also won silver in the 100, said.</p>
<p>The final gold of the sixth day of competition went to Cuban Yoelvis Quesada, who beat both the Olympic and world champions in the men's triple jump.</p>
<p>Quesada set a year's best and Cuban record with a second round leap of 17.85 to join long jumper Ivan Pedroso and high jumper Javier Sotomayor as world champions.</p>
<p>&quot;In Cuba we have a good tradition of jumpers. All the kids want to jump,&quot; said Quesada. &quot;Good jumpers are like water in Cuba, plentiful.&quot;</p>
<p>Britain's defending champion and world record holder Jonathan Edwards took the silver while American Kenny Harrison, the Olympic champion, finished in ninth place.</p>
