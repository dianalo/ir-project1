<p>Greek equities continued their bull run extending their winning streak to six consecutive gainful sessions despite some intraday profit taking in heavy volume.</p>
<p>Brokers said sentiment was bullish on expectations that snap polls will bring about a strong government that will steer the economy harder towards its EMU goal.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is clearly discounting Simitis' victory in the upcoming elections which will mark the end of a prolonged period of political uncertainty,&quot; said Telesis Securities in its weekly market outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock market will consolidate its gains this week. We expect overall sentiment to remain positive throughout the short pre-election period in anticipation of a stable and market friendly government,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>But additional liquidity was seen necessary for the rally to continue.</p>
<p>The Athens general share index finished 0.82 percent, or 7.73 points higher at 948.58 from Friday's 940.85 close after opening at 941.47 points. Turnover dropped to 9.84 from 12.2 billion drachmas on Friday, on volume of 4.8 million shares.</p>
<p>Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos signed a decree on Friday ordering the dissolution of the 300-seat parliament ahead of early elections on September 22.</p>
