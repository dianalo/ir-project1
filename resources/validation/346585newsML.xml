<p>Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea said on Thursday that a tough reform programme being drafted by his centrist government was Romania's last chance to avoid sliding into an economic crisis like neighbouring Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Ciorbea told a news conference that Romania's 22 million people faced the choice of real reforms or collapse &quot;as we unfortunately saw in the countries around us&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to take risks, to issue deadlines in which the economy would be exposed to threat of Bulgarisation,&quot; he said alongside representatives of the World Bank and European Union.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm convinced Romania must remain a bulwark of stability in the region, including from an economic point of view. I believe in reform, even in painful reform. And I am certain Romanians will side with us in this difficult task.&quot;</p>
<p>Ciorbea's centrist coalition, which ousted ex-communists in last November's election, is holding talks with Western financial institutions on a programme to secure credits suspended or witheld last year.</p>
<p>He said Romania's economic performance was even worse than the figures presented by the defeated government and predicted negative growth for 1997.</p>
<p>But the broadcast was clearly intended to soothe the fears of ordinary Romanians rather than provide details of reforms.</p>
<p>Ciorbea made no specific forecasts for the coming year. The reform package, he said, would be made public within two weeks.</p>
<p>The ruling coalition fought last November's elections on pledges to speed reform and reduce the gap in living standards with more advanced ex-communist states such as  Poland and Hungary.</p>
<p>Inflation climbed to 57 percent last year -- more than three times the target agreed with the IMF -- and the budget deficit is believed to have bulged to 5.7 percent of gross domestic product -- compared to forecasts of 2.2 percent.</p>
<p>But Romania has so far escaped the even steeper decline and social turmoil in Bulgaria, where street protesters have been demanding early elections for 25 days.</p>
<p>Romania's leu currency, overvalued before the election, has lost around 45 percent against the dollar since the New Year. Bulgaria's lev is in freefall and inflation stood at 30.8 percent in the first 15 days of January.</p>
<p>Central Bank governor Mugur Isarescu told the news conference that the two countries' economies were different but said Romanians had to choose reforms once and for all.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a big chance now to carry out reforms to their conclusion,&quot; he said. &quot;We will take reforms inside enterprises. This will be the basis for long-term economic growth. This chance will not be repeated. It is now or never.&quot;</p>
<p>Poul Thomsen, who leads the IMF negotiating team, said in a separate television interview that Romania faced tough choices.</p>
<p>&quot;We are faced with the difficult problem of having on the one hand to scale down total public expenditure, and finding more money for social programmes and for reforms,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a complicated task. It takes time and we're working at it.&quot;</p>
