<p>Around 1,000 Bosnians will witness their country's &quot;home&quot; World Cup debut against neighbours Croatia in Bologna on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Italian police said some 500 Bosnians would make their way to the emotional game in the central Italian city from Sarajevo and elsewhere in former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The remaining 500, who fled their country during nearly four years of fighting, were expected to arrive from refugee camps in Italy itself.</p>
<p>Because of the political overtones, fans from the two countries will be segregated but locals expect a very low spectator turnout and few problems.</p>
<p>Bosnian Moslems and ethnic Croats backed by Croatia fought bitterly for part of the Bosnian war and are now joined in a tenuous federation.</p>
<p>Bologna offered to host Bosnia's European Group One qualifying matches at its central Renato Dell'Ara stadium after the world body FIFA ruled out Sarajevo's newly-rebuilt Kosevo stadium on safety grounds.</p>
<p>Italian newspapers reported that the first bus load of Bosnian fans had left Sarajevo for a match loaded with symbolism and whose significance goes far beyond mere qualification for the 1988 World Cup finals in France.</p>
<p>More fans are expected to make the somewhat easier journey from Croatia, which has regular air links with Italy.</p>
<p>Despite strong local sympathy for Bosnia, the weather is likely to determine the Italian turnout, with only a handful of tickets sold on Monday as rain swept the city.</p>
<p>Few, including the Bosnians, give Bosnia much hope against the Croatians who impressed during the Euro '96 finals in England. But to most Bosnians the fact that the match is being played is far more important than the eventual result.</p>
<p>&quot;For us Bosnia-Croatia is the first real match,&quot; Bosnian coach Djemalvdin Musovic said recently, ignoring their 3-0 defeat in their first qualifier in Greece last month.</p>
<p>Bosnian and Croatian players, gathered at a news conference in Bologna on Monday, agreed that the game was an important message of peace for their countries.</p>
<p>They pointed out that they were friends before the war and had remained so during and after the fighting.</p>
<p>One Bosnian player, Sead Halilovic, played previously for the Croatian national team and will be turning out against his former team mates for the first time.</p>
<p>The Bosnians, seeking to avoid controversy, were defensive when asked by a reporter whether there were any non-Moslems in their team. &quot;We don't ask whether the Italian team is all Catholic,&quot; a team spokesman replied.</p>
<p>Several Bosnian stalwarts are veterans of the 1990 Yugoslav national team, the last before the war broke out and the country split into separate republics, and played with and against the Croatians in the old Yugoslav league.</p>
<p>They include 36-year-old captain Mehmed Bazdarevic, now playing in the French third division and Turkish-based goalkeeper Fahrudin Omerovic.</p>
<p>Croatia can count on Italian-based stars Alen Boksic of Juventus and Zvonimir Boban of Milan.</p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow is about friendship, not brotherhood which is something else,&quot; Boban told the news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;It would have been different if we had had to meet Serbia but Zagreb and Belgrade have also established diplomatic relations. And what about France and England or Italy and Austria who fought each other for centuries?,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;In our case, the war is merely more recent.&quot;</p>
