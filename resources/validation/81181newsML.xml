<p>A Bosnian Moslem motorist travelling through Serb-held territory along a NATO-secured motorway was shot and wounded when his car was hijacked, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The victim Nadil Hasic and his wife were travelling on the busy &quot;Route Arizona&quot; when they were pulled over by unindentified car-jackers. They were ordered to lie on the ground and Hasic was shot in the shoulder.</p>
<p>A U.S. helicopter evacuated Hasic who was treated at the U.S. hospital at the village of Kime.</p>
<p>The vehicle has been recovered, a statement from the press office of the NATO-led multi-national peace Implementation Force (IFOR) in Tuzla said.</p>
<p>The Route Arizona which connects the northern Bosnian town of Tuzla with Croatia passes through a patch of Bosnian Serb territory and is patrolled and secured by IFOR.</p>
<p>Thousands of private and commercial vehicles use the road every day and it is generally regarded as safe.</p>
<p>The mandate of the 60,000-strong force, responsible for keeping the former warring factions apart, is expiring in two months, but a scaled-down presence is expected to remain in place.</p>
