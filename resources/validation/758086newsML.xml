<p>Police used batons and tear-gas to avoid a clash on Friday between thousands of orthodox Islamic activists and political groups opposing them, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Both groups almost came face to face after Friday noon prayers at Dhaka's Baitul Mokarram mosque, which had been surrounded by riot police since morning.</p>
<p>Police used metal detectors to check those entering the mosque but found no weapons, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Tension built as anti-fundamentalist groups approached the mosque and police moved in with batons and fired tear-gas after the rival groups tried to attack each other.</p>
<p>Thousands of mullahs later squatted on the street outside the mosque and chanted against what they called &quot;police barbarism&quot;.</p>
<p>The mullahs have been flexing their muscles since July 15 when they spearheaded a general strike across the country over attempts to &quot;defame and ridicule&quot; the Prophet Mohammad by a Jewish woman in Hebron.</p>
<p>The woman plastered storefronts with posters depicting the Prophet as a pig, triggering Moslem outrage around the world.</p>
