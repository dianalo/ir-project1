<p>Experts hope New Zealand's first exchange-traded electricity futures contract will attract speculative interest, but warn the market should not be disappointed if liquidity from that quarter is a long time in coming.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Futures and Options Exchange says it is the first in the world to launch cash-settled electricity futures contracts. Six one-month contracts, from February to July 1997, will be offered from Monday.  </p>
<p>NZFOE chief executive Peter Mansell said demand was strong for a means to hedge the risk inherent in a volatile new wholesale electricity market.</p>
<p>The new market, launched on October 1, has experienced several teething problems. It aims to determine the price of electricity based on supply and demand, but this has been hampered by frequent spikes in the spot electricity price.</p>
<p>Mansell said while it was hoped speculators would trade the contract, boosting its liquidity and attractiveness, he saw initial activity coming predominantly from hedgers.  </p>
<p>&quot;Actually I don't think that it's really designed to be a speculative market. It probably wouldn't hurt if there was speculating activity, but I don't think we're expecting that to be that to be the impetus to get the market going,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Other market players said the contract could be fairly illiquid at the start. Its success in the long run could rest with its ability to attract speculators from outside the electricity industry, they said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The NZFOE will be hoping it's got its message out far and wide. You hope to goodness that your marketing with the banks and the merchant banks and the people with risk finance has worked, so they are attracted in there,&quot; said Electricity Market Company Chief Executive Lincoln Gould.</p>
<p>&quot;People are very often attracted to a new market because of the initial spreads, which are usually fairly wide. So the opportunity for making money is definitely there.</p>
<p>&quot;It may take a little while. I don't think people should be concerned if liquidity is not immediately attracted -- it needs to be given time,&quot; Gould said.  </p>
<p>Energy Link Ltd Managing Director Greg Sise said the nature and extent of the contracts' appeal was &quot;the $64,000 question&quot;. He doubted anyone could predict whether natural hedgers alone could provide enough liquidity to ensure its success.</p>
<p>&quot;You only have to get someone like ECNZ (Electricity Corporation of New Zealand) to say well we're not really interested in the futures market, and that might be enough to kill it,&quot; Sise said.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think worldwide there aren't actually that many new futures contacts that make it. I don't want to be pessimistic, because I think there are a lot of advantages of a futures contract, but I just can't help feeling it's going to take quite a long time to get off the ground.&quot;</p>
<p>Sise said the contracts' appeal could be affected by location, as their final ex-post spot prices were referenced only to the Haywards node in the lower North Island.  </p>
<p>&quot;If you're buying in Auckland you've still got the problem of covering the location factor risk, which can be quite significant,&quot; Sise said, adding that the NZFOE contract could be challenged if generators offered hedges from additional nodes, as was rumoured. Generator hedges are currently referenced to Benmore, in the South Island, as well as Haywards.</p>
<p>Mansell said the monthly, Haywards-referenced contracts were just a start, and the exchange would look at other options in due course if the demand arose.  </p>
<p>He said that at the end of the day it was up to the market and not the NZFOE to provide volumes and liquidity in the electricity contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;We're providing a framework, and the feedback we've had is quite good, but it will take some time to get going.</p>
<p>&quot;It will take a continuing education process, and we need to work with the industry. We're not just going to drop it, leave it and watch it on the 18th of November,&quot; Mansell said.</p>
