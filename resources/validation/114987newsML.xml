<p>The Finnish markka was steady against the mark in early European trade after its entry into Europe's exchange rate mechanism (ERM) over the weekend.</p>
<p>Apart from an earlier brief sell-off which saw the markka weaken through 3.00 per mark, the Finnish currency was firm and steady at 2.9880/10, little changed from the 2.9870 level it traded at in late European trade on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;So far the reaction has been pretty calm except for a few blips out of Asia,&quot; said a Swedish bank dealer. &quot;The view is that ERM will see (the markka) trade even steadier than before.&quot;  </p>
<p>The markka joined the ERM on Saturday at a central rate of 3.04 per mark within 15 percent fluctuation bands.</p>
<p>Few were surprised at Finland's decision to join and there were scant misgivings about the central rate.</p>
<p>&quot;It has always been high on the official agenda and it is seen safe in the current environment,&quot; said Roger Francis, senior analyst at IBJ International in London.</p>
<p>The 15 percent bands also give the markka a lot of leeway around the central rate but analysts expect the Bank of Finland to track a tighter band with some speculating on the 2.5 percent target range used by the Netherlands and Germany.  </p>
<p>A Finnish central bank official said at the weekend that Finland intended to keep the markka within &quot;relatively narrow&quot; bands.</p>
<p>There has been some concern that the ERM link could harm the ability of Finland's key pulp and paper exporters to compete with neighbouring Sweden, still outside the ERM.</p>
<p>&quot;On a European level, it would be political poison for Sweden to devalue or push for excessive depreciation and would certainly weaken Sweden's position within Europe,&quot; said IBJ's Francis.  </p>
<p>Finland's ERM linkage has not changed Sweden's declared stance on its own entry into the mechanism or its possible membership of Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Earlier today, Swedish finance minister Erik Asbrink reiterated Riksbank officials' comments at the weekend, saying pressure on Sweden to join ERM has not increased with Finland's decision to join.</p>
<p>&quot;Finland is three to four quarters ahead of Sweden in economic development,&quot; said Keld Holm, interational economist at Lehman Brothers. &quot;Finland has had a longer period of stability after overcoming the same problems Sweden encountered later.&quot;  </p>
<p>The crown was steady against the mark, trading at 4.3070/00 at 1015 GMT against 4.3100/30 late Friday in Europe.</p>
<p>The mark was mostly steady on the other European currencies, taking Finland's ERM participation in its stride. With Finland in the ERM, focus is now on the re-entry of the Italian lira, expected by the end of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Once you get Italy in, then the pressure will be on Sweden and the UK to also join,&quot; said Michael Lewis, senior economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. &quot;It looks like France and Germany are winning the argument that countries have to join ERM before EMU.&quot;  </p>
<p>The mark was trading at 994.25/55 Italian lire at 1017 GMT, little changed from late Friday levels here of 994.80/5.15.</p>
<p>Against the French franc, the mark stood at 3.3854/59 against 3.3857/61 on Friday.</p>
