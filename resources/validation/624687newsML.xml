<p>-- WOOLWICH TO GIVE DISCOUNTS TO INVESTORS</p>
<p>UK building society Woolwich has unveiled a new package of shareholder discounts in an attempt to persuade its members to hold onto their shares in the company rather than selling them immediately upon its flotation on July 7. It is estimated share prices in Woolwich will open in the area of 270p, which would result in an immediate windfall of about 1,800 sterling for each of the 2.5 million qualifying members. The Woolwich incentive package includes discounts on car insurance premiums as well as unsecured personal loans and requires shareholders to respond by June 30.</p>
<p>-- LMVH THREAT TO GUINNESS OVER 23.8 BN STERLING MERGER PLAN</p>
<p>On Wednesday, LVMH, a 14 per cent shareholder in Guinness, threatened the future of the 28.3 billion sterling merger between Grand Metropolitan and Guinness, by stating that if the merger went ahead, it would end all joint ventures central to the merged group's success, thus terminating joint distribution in France, the US and Asia, all key emerging markets and distribution outlets for Guinness. The French luxury food and drinks group has also suggested it may buy back the 34 per cent stake in Moet Hennessey, its drinks subsidiary, currently owned by Guinness, at a discount price.</p>
<p>-- CALL FOR INCREASED POWER TO FIGHT CRIME ON INTERNET</p>
<p>The UK National Criminal Intelligence Service has requested that the government grant it extra powers to combat the increasing problem of Internet crime. Fraud, theft and terrorism are among the problems cited by NCIS in their call for legislation on electronic information theft. The director general of NCIS said the problem was a new type of crime which does not occur on the streets, but 'on the information highway,' creating problems which will affect 'every citizen'. It is expected the group will face opposition from the software industry and free speech advocates.</p>
<p>-- DELAYS IN PFI CONTRACT COULD COST UP TO NINE MILLION STG</p>
<p>The National Audit Office estimates that delays in the private finance contract for a national insurance recording system have resulted in taxpayers facing a charge of nine million sterling, though the NAO added the contract would provide 'strikingly good value for money'. The contract, awarded to Anderson Consulting, involves a new system holding 64 million national insurance accounts and will cost 135 million sterling. Anderson has agreed to pay the Contributions Agency up to 3.1 million sterling in compensation for the delay.</p>
<p>-- BRITISH GAS TO OFFER PRICE CUTS IN SOUTH WEST</p>
<p>British Gas Trading  GAS.L will proceed with plans to cut natural gas prices in south-west England, which has been given the assignment as the country's first test area for gas supply competition. Gas industry regulator Ofgas said the cuts were allowed on a 'review' basis only, and warned it should not be interpreted as a precedent on how BG will deal with competition in other areas of the country. The UK gas market will be liberalised sometime in 1998 and Ofgas insists any undercutting techniques will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>-- OFWAT LETS ANGLIAN BUY RIVAL</p>
<p>UK water industry regulator Ofwat has given Anglian Water permission to purchase Hartlepool Water, a small rival company, for 19.5 million stg so that it can supply water to customers outside its own area. In a related move, Ofwat has also allowed the purchase of poultry company Buxted Chickens, previously a customer of the Essex &amp; Suffolk water company by Anglian. The Ofwat moves have been deemed significant as they mark the introduction of competition in a sector which has been dominated by local monopolies.</p>
<p>-- BRITISH BIOTECH DIRECTOR RESIGNS</p>
<p>Peter Lewis has resigned from his position as director of research and development at the UK's largest biotech company, British Biotech, the second board director to leave the company in four months. Lewis cited family reasons for his departure, but stated he would stay on at the business as a consultant. Alan Drummond will now assume Lewis' former post. James Noble previously resigned from his position as finance director at Biotech in February.</p>
<p>-- CONTINUED DRIVE TO OUTSOURCING SPURS COMPUTER SERVICES INDUSTRY</p>
<p>According to the 1997 Holway Report, the UK computer software and services market was worth 10.9 billion stg in 1996, making the country the fastest growing market in Europe. The increase in revenues was attributed to continuing moves by companies to outsource their IT operations. Richard Holway, author of the report, believes the millennium date-change will boost the industry, but will not come at the 31 million stg cost estimated by Robin Guenier of Taskforce 2000.</p>
<p>-- ROWLAND RENEWS LONRHO ASSAULT</p>
<p>Former Lonrho chief Tiny Rowland sent a letter to Lonrho on Wednesday stating that if the merger between it and JCI went ahead, he would sell his 'several million shares' in the company. Rowland's primary argument was that the deal would require Lonrho to end its agreement with Ashanti, 'the lowest cost gold producer in Africa' in favour of a deal resulting in holdings in South African gold mining companies which he described as 'far more vulnerable to low gold prices due to their higher production cost. Talks between the two companies are ongoing, but only in their early stages.</p>
