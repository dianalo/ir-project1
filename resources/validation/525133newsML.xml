<p>Central Asia is showing signs of economic recovery after years of disastrous slumps, but the former Soviet region has been extremely slow in luring foreign money, a new United Nations economic survey said on Monday.</p>
<p>The U.N.'s Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) predicted in its annual survey that recovery would continue in Kyrgyzstan, where Gross Domestic Product grew six percent last year, and in Uzbekistan, which turned the corner with two percent growth.</p>
<p>GDP growth in Kazakhstan was forecast to recover to two percent in 1997 from 1996's 0.5 percent, while it was continuing a nosedive in the impoverished mountainous republic of Tajikistan, where it contracted by 17 percent last year.</p>
<p>The ECE said economies of the Turkic-speaking region stretching from the Chinese border to the east to the Caspian Sea to the west were coming out from the cold only slowly.</p>
<p>It estimated that 50 percent of GDP came from the private sector in Kyrgyzstan, some 40 percent in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan but only 20 percent in Turkmenistan and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Foreign trade liberalisation too had some way to go, with the state handling most imports and exports in all of the republics except Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p>Former communists have kept power in most of the Central Asian republics, where liberalisation of prices, the end of state subsidies from Moscow and galloping inflation have sent living standards crashing.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan, all go-slow reformers, accounted for just one percent of overseas direct investment in the world's developing and transitional economies, the ECE said.</p>
<p>The survey said the region continued to scare away foreign investors with its curbs on foreign investment, including restrictions on foreign banks and on repatriation of profits.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan, which was reforming faster, was getting the lion's share with some $2.8 billion in overseas direct investment early in 1996, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The gradualism which all five governments have embraced for the pace of transition measures can be seen as having partly served as a cover to delay the impact of market-oriented restructuring,&quot; the ECE said.</p>
<p>The survey said per capita foreign direct investment flow in Kazakhstan, where more than 27,000 Kazakhs now work for foreign companies or joint ventures compared to some 6,400 in 1993, rose slightly to $54 in 1996 from $50 in 1995.</p>
<p>This was more than five times the figure in Russia, which had $10 per capita foreign direct investment flow in 1996.</p>
<p>Comparative 1996 figures for other Central Asian countries were not available, but in 1995, per capita foreign direct investment flow was $41 in Kyrgyzstan, $57 in Turkmenistan, only $5 in Uzbekistan and just $2 in Tajikistan.</p>
