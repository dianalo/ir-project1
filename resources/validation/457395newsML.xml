<p>Zaire's government is &quot;in denial&quot; about the threat it faces from rebel forces and is thwarting U.S. efforts to end fighting and promote democracy in the vast African nation, U.S. officials say.</p>
<p>Washington denies that it would tacitly back any attempt by rebel leader Laurent Kabila, whose forces already occupy about one fifth of Zaire, to take over the whole country as he has threatened to do.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not going to support some push for power,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>But officials say the main problem is Kinshasa's refusal to negotiate with Kabila until there is a ceasefire. Although Washington supported a call by African leaders on Wednesday for an immediate ceasefire, officials said privately the Zaire government was in no position to dictate terms.</p>
<p>What the United States says it wants to see is negotiations that would lead to a transitional government and eventually, democratic elections.</p>
<p>Kabila's Tutsi-led rebels launched their uprising last October, but have made dramatic gains in recent weeks and last weekend seized Zaire's third largest city, Kisangani, creating a new dimension to the crisis.</p>
<p>Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko, who is receiving cancer treatment in Monaco, plans to return to his homeland this week according to aides, but U.S. officials say their one-time anti-communist ally is becoming increasingly irrelevant.</p>
<p>&quot;From reports I heard he can barely write his name, so the guy clearly isn't going to be around that much longer -- how much longer I don't know,&quot; said one official, speaking anonymously. Mobutu's son has denied he is terminally ill.</p>
<p>Mobutu's entourage &quot;don't want to negotiate with Kabila and they keep hoping and thinking that somehow the French, the Belgians, somebody, is going to come and save the day,&quot; the U.S. official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The basic problem is these folks just don't want to face the reality that Kabila is on the move, he has the momentum. They're into denial.&quot;</p>
<p>The rebels have declared a ceasefire around Kisangani but Kabila has vowed to continue the war on all other fronts until he has negotiations with Mobutu. He says he will only negotiate over how Mobutu steps down.</p>
<p>The Zairean government has agreed to a five-point U.N. plan of which the first point is an immediate ceasefire.</p>
<p>Officials said a meeting in Nairobi on Wednesday between Zaire's Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State George Moose &quot;did not go well.&quot; Washington said on Wednesday it still recognised Kengo as prime minister despite a vote in Zaire's transitional parliament to oust him.</p>
<p>They said they understood that Zairean leaders were sticking to their line of refusing to talk to Kabila until there was a ceasefire. &quot;And here lies the problem,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>&quot;The hope is that we can somehow make the point to the Zairean government ... look, negotiate before it is too late. We've been saying this for weeks but one would think with the falling of Kisangani that this would have become very clear.&quot;</p>
<p>French officials have accused the United States in the past of undermining Mobutu, a long-time French ally, but U.S. officials said they believed Washington and Paris now agreed that the Zairean leader needed to &quot;face reality&quot;.</p>
<p>The United States has opposed a French-backed plan to send a multinational force to Zaire to protect refugees. But U.S. analysts say this is more a domestically driven fear of sending American troops into foreign trouble spots than any attempt to back one side or another in Zaire.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said they were keeping an open mind about Kabila who, despite a Marxist past, had recently been sounding themes of democracy and smaller government. &quot;The proof is in the pudding. We really just don't know,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Officials said they believed Kabila, despite his apparently unstoppable military successes, did have an interest in keeping his options open with the Western powers by agreeing to negotiations.</p>
<p>U.S. analysts believe that if Kabila rejected all offers of negotiations and tried to take over the whole country he could lose support from neighbouring countries like Uganda and Rwanda who have backed him in hopes of creating a buffer zone.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials do not discount Kabila's ability to get to Kinshasa. &quot;He's as capable as anybody,&quot; one said.</p>
