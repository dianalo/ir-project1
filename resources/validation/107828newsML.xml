<p>Victory for Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus in a key budget vote, which exposed rifts in the Social Democratic opposition, has provided a breathing space for his minority government.</p>
<p>But Klaus can take only limited comfort from a split on Wednesday night when four Social Democrats, including a vice chairman, voted with the government on the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman also faces internal party discontent about former communists in his inner circle.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the true test of Klaus's insecure leadership will come only in Senate elections next month, for which the Social Democrats are running neck and neck for the first time with his Civic Democratic Party (ODS), say analysts.</p>
<p>Klaus lost no time to exploit the Social Democrats' embarrassment over vice chairman Karel Machovec and the chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, Jozef Wagner, who broke ranks to allow the budget to pass its first reading.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday's vote clearly demonstrated the division of opinion within the Social Democrats at an important moment,&quot; he told reporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>Klaus, once the king of post-communist Czech reform, has been under heavy pressure since lower house elections in May and June when his three-party coalition lost its majority.</p>
<p>During the summer Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec openly criticised his autocratic leadership style. A truce was truck but Klaus remains on probation pending the senate poll results.</p>
<p>The Social Democrat split gave him a welcome breather.</p>
<p>Zeman, a personal enemy of Klaus, tried to play down the blow to his authority. But he was clearly angered by the four deputies' refusal to back a line agreed by the Social Democratic &quot;club&quot;, or parliamentary party.</p>
<p>&quot;I have never tried to create a monolithic unity,&quot; he told Reuters on Thursday. &quot;On the other hand I expect that the majority opinion of the club should be respected.&quot;</p>
<p>Machovec hinted that many of his fellow deputies who did follow the party line had also been worried by the prospect of instability had the budget been defeated at the first reading.</p>
<p>&quot;I can imagine that the pressure that was put on them was as great as the pressure that was put on myself,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The budget is not the only issue where the party is at odds. The Social Democrats' parliamentary leader Stanislav Gross was quoted this week as expressing concern about former communists who work closely with Zeman in his office.</p>
<p>Zeman was a communist during the 1968 &quot;Prague Spring&quot; reform movement which was crushed by a Soviet-led invasion but he was expelled in the purges which followed.</p>
<p>One of his advisers, Michal Kraus, has a more controversial past. He was a communist parliamentarianism during the time when Moscow-style orthodoxy was restored after 1968.</p>
<p>The Klaus government has its share of old communists, such as Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik who presented the budget. But the issue seems more divisive for the Social Democrats.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Kraus failed to be elected chairman of a parliamentary commission probing a banking collapse. He won only 57 votes although the Social Democrats have 61 deputies.</p>
<p>Jiri Pehe, research director at the Open Media Research Institute (OMRI) in Prague, said Zeman's problems need not be grave as Wagner, for instance, had said for months he would support the budget. But Klaus's problems are far from over.</p>
<p>With the coalition holding 99 of 200 seats in parliament, the Social Democrats could still bring it down by rejecting the budget at its second or third reading, said Pehe.</p>
<p>Much depended on the Senate elections on November 15-16 with a runoff the following week. The Senate will hold limited powers but the polls could show the Social Democrats -- now level with the ODS in opinion polls -- whether they stood a chance of winning early elections if they brought Klaus down.</p>
