<headline>Colgate's global sales feel currency impact.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Colgate-Palmolive Co said Tuesday its fourth-quarter sales, which increased 7.0 percent from a year earlier to $2.29 billion, were off one percentage point because of the strong dollar.</p>
<p>Colgate also said its annual sales, which increased 5.0 percent to $8.7 billion, would have been up 7.0 percent but for the strong dollar.</p>
<p>The company said gross profit margin increased by 170 basis points in the quarter to 49.6 percent, with higher gross margins in every operating division.  </p>
<p>&quot;Colgate enters 1997 with excellent global momentum. Every operating division around the world achieved healthy unit volume growth in the fourth quarter, led by Colgate-North America, up 7.0 percent, and Colgate-Latin America, up 11 percent highlighted by further recovery in Mexico,&quot; said Reuben Mark, chairman and chief executive.</p>
<p>Colgate's European sales declined about 1.0 percent due primarily to currency translation. In the fourth quarter, unit volume increased almost 6.0 percent, with increases in Germany, France, United Kingdom and Italy.  </p>
<p>The company said Colgate-Europe completed 17 major product launches in 1996, raising market share for the majority of its core categories. Total toothpaste achieved overall market leadership in Germany and helped boost market share to a new high in England.</p>
<p>In Latin America, which accounts for 24 percent of the company's sales, sales rose 16 percent and unit volume increased 11 percent in the 1996 fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The company said Colgate-Mexico delivered its best quarter in two years in terms of sales, unit volume and operating profit.  </p>
<p>In North America, accounting for 21 percent of sales, unit volume was up 7.0 percent on a sales increase of 6.0 percent in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>In the Asia/Africa region, fourth-quarter sales grew 7.0 percent and unit volume rose 5.0 percent.</p>
<p>The company said it is investing to build consumption, especially in India and China, where volume grew significantly.</p>
<p>Finally, Colgate said its Hill's Pet Nutrition unit, which accounts for 10 percent of company sales, increased sales 6.0 percent in the fourth quarter on 3.0 percent volume growth.</p>
<p>Hill's recently relaunched the entire Science Diet line, adding three new products, and plans a new U.S. television advertising campaign for Science Diet in 1997.</p>
<p>Colgate posted fourth-quarter net income of $181.7 million, or $1.20 per share, down from $122.5 million, or $0.80 per share, a year earlier. The First Call consensus estimate was $1.19 per share.</p>
