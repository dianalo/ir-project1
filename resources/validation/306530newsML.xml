<p>Managers of Finnish mutual funds see up to 50 percent growth in new subscriptions this year, but say Finns are still wary of stocks and most of the growth will again be in bond and money market funds.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we'll see any rush into stock funds,&quot; said Markku Savikko, managing director of the Finnish Association of Mutual Funds.</p>
<p>&quot;Finns have usually been cautious investors, and I believe they will continue to be cautious in the future,&quot; said Tim Hermansson, managing director of Alfred Berg Rahasto Oy.</p>
<p>With interest on tax-free bank deposits down to two percent, private and institutional investors are said to be eyeing alternative investments.</p>
<p>But fund managers and investment industry representatives say stock funds will get only a fraction of the billions to be freed up from bank accounts this year.</p>
<p>Last year, the amount of money in mutual funds registered in Finland more than doubled, rising by year-end to about 12 billion markka from 5.2 billion, Savikko said.</p>
<p>But only about 250 million markka in new money was put into either stock funds or balanced funds -- which invest about half their principal in stocks -- while over four billion markka was pumped into money market funds in 1996, Savikko said.</p>
<p>Growth in stock funds came almost exclusively from share appreciation -- rather than from new money, Savikko said.</p>
<p>At end-November 1996, Finnish stock funds were worth a total of 2.31 billion markka, up from 2.23 billion at the beginning of last year, according to securities and derivatives exchange Suomen Optiomeklarit Oy (SOM).</p>
<p>Finnish balanced funds were worth 1.31 billion markka, up from 964 million, and long-term bond and money funds 1.82 billion, up from 1.24 billion, SOM said.</p>
<p>Despite the flows into bond and money market funds last year, Finland's mutual fund industry remains relatively undeveloped in terms of capital invested, Savikko said.</p>
<p>Finnish mutual funds -- of all types -- accounted for only 0.1 percent of total European mutual fund investment at end-1995, versus 1.7 percent in Swedish funds, Savikko said.</p>
<p>Mutual funds are still dwarfed by bank deposits. At end-September, there was over 75 billion markka in time deposits and over 204 billion in other bank accounts, according to Statistics Finland (SF).</p>
<p>About 42 billion markka of the end-September total in time deposits was due to mature in less than six months and 55 billion within a year, SF said.</p>
<p>But fund managers do not envisage any quick change in Finns' investment behaviour.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we'll see any sudden change from the current practice of keeping money safely in bank deposits to a situation where investors would seek long-term growth in stocks,&quot; said Kari Ojala of PSP-Rahastoyhtio Oy.</p>
<p>About half of the money expected to be invested in mutual funds this year is likely to come from organisations which tend to favour bond and money market funds, said Henrik Damsten, managing director of Evli-Rahasto Oy.</p>
<p>&quot;If we assume that 10 billion markka in new money could be invested in mutual funds this year, then about half will come from companies that mainly use money market funds for short-term cash management,&quot; Damsten said.</p>
<p>Besides the usual Finnish investment conservativism, fund managers said last year's exceptional 40 percent rise in the HEX index would also keep investors from jumping headlong into the stock market now.</p>
<p>&quot;Surely, within five years, the absolute amount of money flowing into stock funds may increase, but such a wild rise as last year's (in the HEX) may dampen investment in stock funds in the short term,&quot; said Ojala.</p>
<p>&quot;The bourse's 1996 rise is more likely to curb than to encourage investment in stock funds,&quot; said Hermansson.</p>
