<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Tuesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - London's FTSE 100 index ended lower on Thursday, depressed by concern about the health of Wall Street and the prospect of a six-week domestic election campaign, dealers said.</p>
<p>Although the market received a modest boost in the afternoon when the Dow's performance turned out to be not as bad as some had feared, a growing conviction that U.S. interest rates will rise on March 25 kept the FTSE subdued, they said. The blue-chip index ended 16.5 points weaker at 4,356.8, after bouncing from a low of 4,340.1.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Worries about a possible delay for Europe's monetary union and the fate of U.S. interest rates pushed German shares down to a two-week low in a choppy bourse session on Tuesday. The DAX lost 59.80 points to end bourse trade at 3,291.19 points, dropping below the psychologically crucial 3,300-point level for the first time since early March. In post-bourse trade the index fell 47.52 to 3,289.59.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares closed 0.56 percent down in the second consecutive fall on doubts about the timetable for European Union as well as due to a weaker dollar and volatile U.S. markets ahead of the FOMC meeting on March 25. The CAC-40 index was down 14.53 points at 2,573.95.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares ended easier on Tuesday but above the day's lows, continuing a recent weaker bias. Dealers said trade was extremely nervous and influenced to a large extent by derivatives transactions. Insecurity about the future development of U.S. interest rates was seen keeping some investors away from the market. The broad Swiss Performance Index slid 20.30 points to 2,871.54.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo's key Nikkei stock average closed over two percent higher on Tuesday, as market participants rejoiced over the government's decision to draw up plans to boost the stagnant land market by the end of the month which is also the end of the fiscal year, brokers said. The 225-share Nikkei average gained 391.70 points to 18,445.20.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks slumped to a lower close on Tuesday, dragged down by fears of higher interest rates and profit-taking in the popular China plays. The Hang Seng Index fell 89.62 points to 12,748.91, shedding most of Monday's 102 point gain.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian shares closed lower on Tuesday, the market slipping away in the afternoon in line with a rapidly fading futures market. The All Ordinaries index lost 23.1 points to 2,404.3.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African shares ended a lethargic day weak, with golds depressed by a weak bullion price and industrials easing in sympathy. The gold price was trading below $350 per ounce. Dealers said the bullion price looked vulnerable and if it did not pick up in the next few days, $340 per ounce would be the next target on the downside. A lack of fresh factors saw industrials drifting lower. Dealers said a weak bond market also added to the negativity in the market.</p>
<p>Volumes were mediocre and dealers saw the market quiet ahead of the long weekend. Friday is a Human Rights Day holiday and next week sees the Easter long weekend. The market on Wednesday would take its cue from Wall Street's performance, dealers said.</p>
<p>The overall index was off 26.9 points to 7,085.5, industrials lost 10.9 points to 8,321.6 and golds lost 20.4 points to 1,370.3.</p>
