<headline>W African/Med markets firm on good refinery margin.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mediterranean and West African crudes continued to firm on Tuesday as good refining margins translated into buying from many areas, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are phoning me from all over  - North America, South America, the Far East and of course the Mediterranean looking for crude. Margins are good everywhere,&quot; one large West African equity holder said.</p>
<p>Traders and equity holders of Nigerian crudes showed little concern on Tuesday following Shell's announcement it had declared force majeure on exports of Bonny crude oil because of a strike by contractors at the terminal.</p>
<p>&quot;We were informed by Shell that all offshore loading activities of Bonny were suspended due to an industrial strike...but this kind of thing in Nigerian production is normal, very normal,&quot; one regular Bonny lifter said.</p>
<p>Shell said on Tuesday it had declared force majeure on the 450-475,000 barrel a day Bonny loadings with effect from Monday and this would continue as long as the strike by the staff lasted. It later added that exports from the terminal were likely to be delayed but cancellations were not expected.</p>
<p>Traders said they only expected the strike to lead to often-seen two day loading delays which would to increase Bonny Light's premium against Dated Brent.</p>
<p>The crude is currently talked around dated Brent +40 cents following deals at the end of last week around dated +35 and dated +37 cents.</p>
<p>Qua Iboe was assessed a few cents lower after one trader was heard to have bought two (May 18-19, May 21-31) cargoes on Monday at dated Brent +36 cents.</p>
<p>Demand for Urals was steady with a few large cargoes on offer and talk around recent deal level dated Brent $-1.10/-$1.05 a barrel cif Med.</p>
