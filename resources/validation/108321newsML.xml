<title>USA: Pall, Memtec both seen gunning for Gelman.</title>
<headline>Pall, Memtec both seen gunning for Gelman.</headline>

<p>Pall Corp and Memtec Ltd may have different reasons, but they seem equally determined to acquire Gelman Sciences Inc.</p>
<p>Analysts and arbitrageurs were reluctant to say whether that portends an all-out bidding war, especially after a rally in American Depositary Shares of Memtec on Thursday that reflected some doubt on Wall Street of Memtec's commitment.</p>
<p>Still, Gelman would nicely complement the operations of either suitor and will likely be hotly pursued by both, filtration industry analysts said.  </p>
<p>Shares in Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Gelman closed up 3 at 29 on the American Stock Exchange on the news that it was in discussions with Pall about a possible acquisition.</p>
<p>Gelman reached a definitive agreement on August 30 to be acquired by Australia's Memtec, which said Thursday it intends to proceed with the agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think Memtec is going to back away,&quot; said Robert W. Baird &amp; Co analyst Walter Morris.</p>
<p>Memtec wants Gelman's sophisticated membrane technology to put Memtec into closer competition with East Hills, N.Y.-based Pall and Millipore Corp, Morris said. </p>
<p>Pall -- much larger than either Gelman or Memtec -- wants Gelman to broaden Pall's medical and process businesses and &quot;frankly, to eliminate a pesky competitor,&quot; Morris said.</p>
<p>Gelman sales in fiscal 1996 ended July 31 were $112 million, versus $103.5 million in fiscal 1995. Memtec sales in the year ended June 30 were $175 million, up from $145 million in fiscal 1995. Pall had revenues of $960.3 million in fiscal 1996 ended August 3, up from $822.2 million in fiscal 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Pall under chief executive Eric Krasnoff has been more acquisitive than under previous management teams,&quot; said Morgan Stanley &amp; Co analyst Mark Gulley.  </p>
<p>&quot;If he does this deal, it will have been his third acquisition&quot; since taking the helm at Pall about two years ago, Gulley said.</p>
<p>Krasnoff's acquisitions have tended to broaden Pall's presence in existing markets, rather than move it into new areas -- a pattern into which a Gelman acquisition would fit, said Fourteen Research analyst Anthony Ginsberg.</p>
<p>&quot;There's good overlap ... They're in many of the same venues and markets,&quot; Gulley said.</p>
<p>Morris said, &quot;Gelman is strategically important to both companies.&quot;</p>
<p>Arbitrageurs seemed to cast doubt Thursday on Memtec's contention that it plans to proceed with the Gelman deal by bidding up the Australian company's American depository shares as much as 3-5/8 in the morning. They lost ground in the afternoon to close up 1-15/16 at 28-15/16.</p>
<p>The rally in part was likely explained by short covering, arbitrageurs said.</p>
<p>Late Thursday, Gelman issued a statement saying it intended to pursue its agreement with Memtec, but also to talk with Pall and any other interested parties.</p>
