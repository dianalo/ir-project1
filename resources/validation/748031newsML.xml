<p>Canadian bonds opened softer on Wednesday, easing after yesterday's rally and volatile ahead of a C$1.3 billion auction of 30-year bonds, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Canada will auction 8.0 percent bonds due June 1, 2027 at 1315 EDT/1715 GMT and investors are unlikely to buy new supply with prices near all-time highs, said Sheldon Dong, Midland Walwyn Capital's manager of fixed-income research. &quot;It creates a lot of uncertainty in our bond market.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond slipped C$0.16 to C$120.34 to yield 6.454 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond rose 1/32 to yield 6.41 percent. The spread between the two stayed steady at four basis points from Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>Hank Cunningham, director of fixed income at First Marathon Securities, added that Canadian bond markets were also taking a breather after yesterday's rally on bullish comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. &quot;Some sober reflection on what Greenspan had to say gave pause,&quot; Cunningham said.</p>
<p>Greenspan, who signalled that U.S. short-term interest rates were likely to remain steady for the time being, will finish his Congress testimony today.  </p>
<p>Some market players were worried about a short-term pull-back, but both analysts said that Canada's market would power higher as rate hikes were kept at bay. &quot;The mood is pretty bullish,&quot; Cunningham said.</p>
<p>In other prices, Canada's 10-year benchmark bond lost C$0.26 to reach C$109.86 to yield 5.913 percent. The U.S. 10-year bond lost 1/32 to yield 6.13 percent, so the negative spread between the bonds narrowed to 22 basis points from Tuesday's close.</p>
