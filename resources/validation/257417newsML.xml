<p>Russian communists and their allies in the lower house of parliament, in a major change of tack, on Sunday dropped their opposition to the 1997 draft budget.</p>
<p>&quot;The style of work characterised by confrontation with the executive power does not take us anywhere. We need to change our style,&quot; said Yury Maslyukov, a leading communist and chairman of the Duma committee for economic policy.</p>
<p>He called for the State Duma (lower house) to vote for the budget.</p>
<p>Maslyukov's comment was a dramatic change from the communist line on December 6, the previous day of the parliamentary budget debate, when party leaders called for the plan to be rejected.</p>
<p>&quot;Our main task now is to pass this digusting budget with one aim in mind -- to maintain stability in society,&quot; said Nikolai Kharitonov, leader of the conservative Agrarian Party faction.</p>
<p>But Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov told parliament that communists reserved the right to block the budget in later readings if certain conditions, such as creating a programme for industrial growth and payment of back wages, were not met.</p>
<p>He also called on President Boris Yeltsin, recovering from a major heart operation, to sack Anatoly Chubais, Kremlin's chief of staff and a hate figure for the opposition which says he has amassed unlimited power during Yeltsin's illness.</p>
<p>The draft has to pass three readings in the Duma before being submitted to the upper chamber, the Federation Council.</p>
<p>Communists and their allies hold a majority in the Duma, which is expected to vote on the draft later on Sunday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is to address parliament before it votes, has promised to pay most government debts and create an investment fund.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin, who celebrated four years at his post on Saturday, received a boost on Friday from the International Monetary Fund which decided to renew monthly payouts of a $10 billion loan to Russia.</p>
<p>The IMF gave the go-ahead for the release of roughly $336 million, citing &quot;improved revenue performance&quot;. It had previously criticised Russia's tax collection record.</p>
<p>Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the liberal opposition Yabloko group, said Yabloko would continue to oppose the government's spending plan, the only major Duma party left doing so.</p>
<p>Russian Finance Minister Alexander Livshits opened discussion of the 1997 draft budget on Sunday with a promise of money for regional administrations.</p>
<p>&quot;We have managed to increase transfers to the regions by four trillion roubles ($720 million) in 1997,&quot; Livshits told the Duma, which has rejected the budget once before.</p>
<p>Livshits said the plan envisaged a deficit of 3.5 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>The target deficit had been widened from the government's initial proposal of 3.3 percent and Chernomyrdin said a further widening of the gap could be damaging.</p>
<p>The Russian government has championed a tight monetary policy which has led to a steep fall in the rate of inflation, from near 20 percent in January 1995 to 1.9 percent in November.</p>
<p>The squeeze has brought misery for millions of workers, who have not been paid for months by cash-strapped firms. Tax revenue, in turn, is well below target.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin has said that if budget targets were met and 1997 inflation did not exceed 11-12 percent, the economy could grow by two percent. GDP fell six percent in real terms in the first 11 months of this year from January-November 1995.</p>
