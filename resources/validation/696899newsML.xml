<p>High sulphur fuel oil barges traded higher early on Monday before steadying, with traders saying that a player's attempt to fix a higher price did not work with demand very slow.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges traded once at $85 fob ARA in the morning for 1,000 tonnes before moving down to trade at $84 or the same as Friday's close. Late morning talk was $83.50/$84 for buyers and sellers respectively.</p>
<p>Traders said they were surprised why a Rotterdam-based bunker trader bought the first barge at the higber number with better offers in the market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they just wanted to fix a higher price early in the day, but it did not work as all talk turned lower later to about $83.50/$84,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't really speak of a real market now. Demand is low and everybody says it was fixed,&quot; the trader added. Others agreed that demand was thin.</p>
<p>Bunker enquiries were also thin and no deals were reported early in the day. No deals were heard in low sulphur fuel oil barges, with some traders saying they were still talked at Friday's $95/$97 range but others said the levels were a little lower with demand also very low.</p>
