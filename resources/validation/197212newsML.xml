<p>Irish government bonds edged higher in afternoon trade on Monday, buoyed by firm performances from the UK and European bond markets although dealers said volume was low.</p>
<p>&quot;The Irish market has performed quite well as gilts and European markets pushed ahead,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are around 92 basis points over Germany in the 10-year area and 87 basis points below the UK, pretty much where we opened, so we have kept pace.&quot;</p>
<p>Attention this week will focus on Germany, where German October M3 data and the Ifo report are due.</p>
<p>The market will also keep a close eye on U.S. supply.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury is expected to auction $28 billion of three and six-month paper later in Monday's session, followed by $18.25 billion of two-year notes on Tuesday and $12.5 billion of five-year notes on Wednesday.</p>
<p>By 1542 GMT, the 6.5 percent Irish five-year benchmark bond was at 101.79 to yield 5.97 percent, up from 101.72 at Friday's close while the 10-year bond gained 15 pence to 108.80 to yield 6.62 percent.</p>
