<p>By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent</p>
<p>Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers Friday warned Japan against trying to export its way out of its economic problems and urged it to fix problems at home to bolster growth.</p>
<p>In a speech to the Japan-American Society, Summers also said the United States will continue to press Japan to open its markets, with America's focus first on ensuring that Tokyo lives up to trade agreements.</p>
<p>&quot;Too often in the past we have seen cycles in which Japan's trade surplus has declined with consequent reductions in trade frictions only to rise again,&quot; the Treasury official said. &quot;It is critically important to all of us that we avoid a repeat of this phenonmenon.&quot;</p>
<p>Japan has halved its trade surplus since 1994 -- a development that Summers called &quot;encouraging&quot; and attributed to Tokyo's promotion of domestic demand and its efforts to liberalise trade and restructure its economy.</p>
<p>To prevent that from unravelling, Summers said that it was &quot;essential&quot; for Japan to restore domestic-demand led growth. That means adopting economic policies that restore confidence and working as rapidly as possible to repair the problems of Japan's battered banking system, he said.</p>
<p>After growing in the early part of last year, Japan's economy has sputtered, sapping demand for imports. At the same time, the steep fall of the Japanese yen -- it has dropped 50 percent against the dollar in the last two years -- has made Japanese exports more competitive on world markets.</p>
<p>U.S. officials are particularly worried that Tokyo's plans to tighten budget policy, including raising consumption taxes in April, could further undermine domestic demand, making the country that much more reliant on exports for growth.</p>
<p>Summers argued that Japan's underlying budget deficit is &quot;relatively modest&quot; and noted that Tokyo has the ability to pursue a flexible fiscal stance if dictated by changing economic conditions.</p>
<p>He said that the measures Japan is taking to strengthen its banking system look &quot;very encouraging&quot; and he voiced hopes that they would be put in place quickly.</p>
<p>Reviewing the past four years of dealing with Japan, Summers said &quot;real progress&quot; has been made in putting the bilateral relationship back into better balance and gave the &quot;framework&quot; agreement between the two part of the credit.</p>
<p>He said the United States will continue to work to resolve the several trade problems that remain with Japan and will be prepared to take appropriate action in response to any new problems that come up in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;Wherever necessary, we will be prepared to pursue our interest directly with the Japanese government,&quot; he said.</p>
