<p>Nobel peace prize winner Joseph Rotblat , adding his anxieties to the debate over the cloning of sheep, called on Tuesday for the creation of an international ethics committee to monitor scientific advances.</p>
<p>The veteran anti-nuclear campaigner said he feared advances in genetic engineering could pose as great a threat to humanity as the atom bomb.</p>
<p>&quot;My worry is that other advances in human science may lead to other means of mass destruction more readily available than nuclear weapons. Genetic engineering is quite a possible area because of its frightful potentiality,&quot; Rotblat told BBC radio.</p>
<p>Scientists in Scotland said this week that they had cloned a sheep called Dolly using a ewe's egg cell and a mammary gland cell taken from a second ewe.</p>
<p>The development raised alarm that science has arrived at the brink of creating Frankenstein-style human clones, though Dolly's creators deny this.</p>
<p>U.S President Clinton has called on his national bioethics advisory panel to report on the legal and ethical implications within 90 days.</p>
<p>Rotblat said scientists themselves should form international ethics committees to regulate developments in all branches of science.</p>
<p>&quot;However unpleasant it may be for scientists that science may have to be somehow controlled...I would like to see the setting up of an international ethical committee,&quot; said Rotblat.</p>
<p>The committee should vet projects before they are even started, said the 87-year-old nuclear physicist, who won the Nobel prize in 1995 for his campaign against the atom bomb he helped create.</p>
<p>Politicians, he said, simply did not understand science well enough to regulate it.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it comes back to the scientists themselves to undertake this job.&quot;</p>
