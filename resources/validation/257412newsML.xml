<p>A small group of students from the southern town of Nis began a symbolic march to Belgrade on Sunday as part of protests against alleged election fraud which they say deprived Serbia's opposition of victory in big cities.</p>
<p>The Zajedno (Together) opposition coalition said it was cheated of victory in local elections in November in major towns including the capital Belgrade and the industrial town of Nis.</p>
<p>The 17 students said their 230-km (145-mile) protest march from Nis was intended &quot;to draw the attention of local and world public opinion to protests over the forgery of election results in the town of Nis.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are 17 members because that is in how many electoral units the results were forged,&quot; the independent Belgrade news agency Beta quoted a spokesman of the student committee, Nikola Bozinovic, as saying.</p>
<p>About 130 students from the northern town of Novi Sad finished a similar 80-km (50-mile) march to the capital on Saturday. They were cheered on by thousands of people in villages and towns along their route.</p>
<p>Serbia's opposition and students have staged daily street protests for 28 straight days demanding the reversal of alleged election fraud.</p>
<p>The opposition is using marches to spread its message, accusing the state-run media of failing to keep people informed about opposition demonstrations and aims.</p>
<p>The Nis students say they want to show President Slobodan Milosevic voting records from the 17 electoral units.</p>
<p>&quot;With the wish that civil war never again breaks out in Serbia we remain determined not to allow dictatorship to take over in the country we live in, we call on you to return within the framework of the law,&quot; the students said in a letter to Milosevic.</p>
<p>The students asked to meet Milosevic on Tuesday at 1230 GMT.</p>
