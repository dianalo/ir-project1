<title>GERMANY: German church is set on fire.</title>
<headline>German church is set on fire.</headline>

<p>An evangelical church in the northern German city of Hamburg was set on fire on Wednesday after being daubed with right-wing and Satanic symbols, police said.</p>
<p>No one was injured and the building was only slightly damaged by the fire, which was set at the building's entrance door in the early hours.</p>
<p>Police said the symbols daubed on the church walls did not necessarily mean that right-wing extremists started the blaze since they said did not usually use Satanic symbols.</p>
<p>A police spokeswoman said that, unlike a church gutted by suspected right-wing extremists just over a week ago, the parish involved had not protected asylum seekers or taken part in political activity.</p>
<p>Suspected extremists set fire to a church in the northern town of Luebeck 10 days ago. They daubed Nazi swastikas on the walls and scrawled the name of a local priest whose parish is sheltering a family of asylum seekers to prevent their deportation to Algeria.</p>
