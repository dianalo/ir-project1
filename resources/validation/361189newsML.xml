<p>Belgian holding company Societe Generale de Belgique SA (SGB) on Thursday denied market talk that it had sold some of its stake in French hotel group Accor.</p>
<p>&quot;We have sold nothing. SGB has taken no decision about Accor,&quot; an SGB spokeswoman told Reuters. She declined further comment. Earlier on Thursday French fund managers said that SGB, a unit of French financial group Cie de Suez , was on the verge of selling its holdings in Accor, and that they themselves had been sounded out about their interest in buying Accor shares.  </p>
<p>Asked whether SGB was considering selling its Accor stake, the SGB spokeswoman declined to comment. </p>
<p>SGB has a 9.23 percent stake in the French hotel group.</p>
<p>In October, Suez chief executive officer Gerald Mestrallet told a Belgian newspaper that Accor was not a strategic participation for Suez.</p>
<p>Some analysts consider it would make sense for SGB to sell the Accor stake. SGB has a tradition of trying to have controlling stakes in all its subsidiaries, and past efforts to have a bigger say and stake in Accor have been blocked by its independent-minded management. SGB also has a lot of debt.  </p>
<p>SGB has 32 billion Belgian francs worth of debt, following its acquisition of an extra 25 percent stake in its Tractebel unit late last year.</p>
<p>SGB's 3,053,509 million Accor shares -- at the current 742 French francs per share and at a French franc worth 6.11 Belgian francs -- is worth about 13.8 billion Belgian francs.</p>
