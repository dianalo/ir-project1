<p>Belgian aviation firm  Sonaca SA said on Tuesday it returned to profit in 1996 and expected net earnings to rise sharply in 1997.</p>
<p>Managing director Christian Jacquemin told Reuters in an interview the company, 92 percent owned by the southern Belgian region of Wallonia, had a 1996 profit of 25 million Belgian francs after having lost 957 million in 1995.</p>
<p>He forecast 1997 net earnings would reach 90 million francs.</p>
<p>Turnover would rise to 4.7 billion francs in 1997 from 3.14 billion in 1996 and 2.56 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>The 1996 results still have to be approved by the June 1 annual general meeting of shareholders.</p>
<p>Sonaca is in the process of overhauling production involving 750 million francs in investments, Jacquemin said. The cost estimate is up from an original 700 million francs.</p>
<p>The overhaul, to speed up production and restructuring changes in the next two years to cope with an increased order flow, will cost an estimated 230 workers their jobs by the year 2000, down from an original forecast of 400 job losses.</p>
<p>The company currently employs 1,131 people.</p>
<p>The bulk of Sonaca's business involves making wing parts for Airbus and assembling 50-seat Brazilian Embraer jets.</p>
<p>The company has 48 firm orders for the jets for 1998 and 32 for 1997 after 11 orders in 1996. The orders come mainly from U.S.  Continental Airlines  CAIa.N and regional European airlines. Jacquemin said Sonaca had 213 options for the Embraer.</p>
<p>Sonaca is one of three Belgian companies taking part in a 3.7 billion franc research and development study phase for the planned Airbus A3XX large plane by European aircraft consortium Airbus Industrie  ARBU.CN.</p>
<p>The $10 billion programme for the A3XX will have a basic 555-seat version with further longer-range and stretched versions. The first prototype of the basic version is to fly in 1998 and the 'superjumbo' is to enter serial production by 2003.</p>
<p>The Belgian state has offered the Belgian companies taking part in the project repayable advances for up to 80 percent of the cost to help them finance their share in the project, Jacquemin said.</p>
<p>The Airbus consortium is made up of French state-owned Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale  AERP.CN, British Aerospace plc  BA.L, Daimler-Benz Aerospace  DAIG.F and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain.</p>
