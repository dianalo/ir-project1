<title>MALAYSIA: KL interbank rates softer in flush market.</title>
<headline>KL interbank rates softer in flush market.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-07-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Interbank rates were softer on Wednesday on continued lending by foreign funds which remained flush, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreigners are still long and this will continue to keep rates under pressure,&quot; said a dealer at a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>Trading was cautious with players watching closely movements in the Thai baht, dealers said. The baht fell sharply on Wednesday after the Bank of Thailand announced it would let the currency float.</p>
<p>&quot;But I don't think we will see a repeat of what happened in May,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The baht came under severe attack by speculators in May which spilled over to other regional currencies. A massive intervention by Bank Negara then to support the ringgit caused a sudden tightness in the market and pushed interbank rates to unusually high levels.</p>
<p>One-week money was at 6.30/35 percent against 6.30/80 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>One-month money was at 7.25/30 percent from 7.35/40, and three-month at 7.40/45 percent against 7.45/50.</p>
<p>Dealers said overnight rate was likely to trade slightly higher due to payment for Bank Negara bills worth one billion ringgit on Wednesday, against a maturity of 500 million.</p>
<p>The overnight closed at 5.5 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were mostly unchanged due to uncertainy over the direction of interbank rates, futures dealers said.</p>
<p>At 0300 GMT, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was unchanged at 92.68, or an implied yield of 7.32 percent.</p>
<p>The December contract was up one point to 92.79, or 7.21 percent while March 1998 was unchanged at 92.80, or 7.20 percent.</p>
