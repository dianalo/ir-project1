<p>An expected jump in August U.S. retail sales will not alter forecasts for a third-quarter consumer spending slowdown, economists said.</p>
<p>This should muddy the economic waters just weeks before Federal Reserve policymakers meet to chart monetary policy on September 24, said analysts looking beyond Commerce Department release of the retail data at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT on Friday.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of 26 economists produced an average forecast for a 0.7-percent jump in August retail sales, compared to July's anemic 0.1-percent gain.  </p>
<p>&quot;If (retail sales) come in at 0.7 percent, it still leaves consumer spending growth below the pace of the second quarter, but maybe not enough to put off a tightening,&quot; said Christopher Low, senior economist at HSBC Markets Inc.</p>
<p>Sales excluding automobiles are seen gaining 0.4 percent in August, versus July's 0.3-percent rise.</p>
<p>Economists said strong vehicle sales are expected to account for the bulk of the August gain. Also, a rise in merchandise sales was seen offsetting a drop in grocery store and gasoline sales.  </p>
<p>Lower food and gas prices reduced the dollar amount of total sales from these basic necessities, analysts said.</p>
<p>MFR Inc economist Richard Koss said if August retail sales post as expected, that will not send a &quot;raging signal&quot; to the Fed of an overheating economy.</p>
<p>He said the expected August gain represents a return to trend after the Olympics and atypically cool summer weather dampened July and June sales.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fed is clearly skirting near the edge,&quot; Koss said, alluding to a possible 25 basis point short-term interest rate tightening by Fed officials.  </p>
<p>Cheryl Katz, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, foresees the U.S. economy losing steam in the second half of the year, in turn suppressing retail sales.</p>
<p>&quot;Our economic viewpoint is the economy is slowing in the second half versus the first half of this year and (a slowdown in retail sales) is a trend and not just a one-month phenomenon,&quot; Katz said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's apparent that consumer spending is growing much more slowly in the third quarter than in the first half of the year,&quot; she added.  </p>
<p>Whether the Fed will tighten monetary policy or stick to the status quo at the upcoming meeting remains a close call, Katz said, but she leaned toward a 25-basis point rate hike as added insurance for the inflation-wary Fed.</p>
<p>Turning to the U.S. credit markets, Wall Street's relatively high retail sales estimate sets the scene for a potential rally as the report is more likely to come in below, rather than above, expectations,  HSBC's Low said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's one of the last indicators that can sway the Fed before the meeting, which gives it added importance in the marketplace,&quot; Low said. He added any figure below 0.5 percent would spark a rally.</p>
