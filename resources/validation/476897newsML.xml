<p>Jury selection began on Monday in the trial of Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh, accused of blowing up the Oklahoma City federal building two years ago in the worst attack against civilians in U.S. history.</p>
<p>McVeigh and former Army buddy Terry Nichols have been charged with bombing the Alfred P. Murrah federal building on April 19, 1995. The blast killed 168 people, including 19 children, and injured hundreds more. They face the death penalty if convicted.</p>
<p>McVeigh is charged with planting the bomb and with the first-degree murder of eight federal officials killed in the blast. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Matsch called the trial to order with an explanation of the jury selection process.</p>
<p>The trial, expected to last up to four months, was moved to Denver to ensure a fair hearing.</p>
<p>McVeigh and Nichols, who have both pleaded not guilty, are being tried separately. Nichols will be tried at a later date.</p>
<p>&quot;The defendant is present and ready and seated with me at this table,&quot; McVeigh's chief attorney Stephen Jones told the court. Nichols was not in the courtroom and is not expected to attend the trial, although his lawyers are present.</p>
<p>Security was high, with concrete barricades surrounding the city block where the federal courthouse and office building are housed. Security cameras kept watch on the area, manhole covers were sealed shut and police were stationed at critical positions.</p>
<p>A tense-looking William McVeigh, the defendant's father, entered the courthouse with Jones. Twelve seats were set aside for the blast's &quot;victims&quot; -- survivors and family members of those killed -- who travelled here to attend the proceedings.</p>
<p>Roy Sells, whose wife, Lee, was killed in the bombing, lined up nearly two hours before the session opened to get one of the coveted courtroom seats. &quot;I want to see who they eliminate and who they choose,&quot; he said, referring to the jury selection.</p>
<p>Sells, whose wife worked for the federal Housing and Urban Development Department, expressed confidence in the prosecutors.</p>
<p>Tom Kight, whose stepdaughter, Frankie Merrell, died in the blast, said the family was still haunted by the loss of the 23-year-old woman, who left a small child. &quot;Yesterday was a difficult day because it was Easter. We were recalling hiding Easter eggs when Frankie was small,&quot; he said before going in.</p>
<p>In Oklahoma City, a special closed-circuit telecast, restricted for use by family members of the victims, was on view at a Federal Aviation Administration facility under tight guard.</p>
<p>Prosecutors will argue that McVeigh and Nichols harboured anti-government sentiment after an attack by federal agents on the Branch Davidian cult compound at Waco, Texas, which led to the deaths of about 80 people on April 19, 1993, exactly two years before the Oklahoma City blast.</p>
<p>The defence is expected to say the government has the wrong man and argue that the bombing may have been planned by an unholy international terrorist alliance including Iraq and neo-Nazis.</p>
<p>The government has characterised this scenario as fanciful and will argue that McVeigh and Nichols were the masterminds of the bombing plot.</p>
<p>The first task at the trial is to seat an impartial jury. Notices were sent to 1,000 prospective jurors in Denver and 22 surrounding counties, the largest potential pool of jurors in Colorado history. Potential jurors are expected to be closely questioned about what impact recent pre-trial publicity about purported confessions by McVeigh has had on them.</p>
<p>McVeigh's lawyers, who have denied their client confessed, tried unsucessfully last week to delay the trial. But an appeals court turned them down, paving the way for the trial to begin.</p>
