<p>Some foreign banks have taken steps to expand their Tokyo market operations as they see increased business opportunities from planned financial reforms as well as an abundance of investors, bank officials say.</p>
<p>&quot;We chose Tokyo as the geographic integration point because of the broad range of needs here from Japanese institutional investors,&quot; a Lehman Brothers Japan Inc spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers integrated its Asian operations in Tokyo late last year by creating a new division called Asian Capital Markets, which consists of foreign exchange, fixed income, and equity and derivatives markets operations.</p>
<p>This made Tokyo one of the company's three major centres along with New York and London, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>In recent years, high costs and complex taxes and regulations have thinned Tokyo market operations. A significant volume of the foreign exchange business has shifted to Hong Kong and Singapore, which are considered to be less costly and more open as financial centres.</p>
<p>In April 1995, Tokyo averaged $167 billion worth of foreign exchange transactions a day, compared with $477 billion in London and $266 billion in New York.</p>
<p>Japan's sweeping &quot;Big Bang&quot; financial market reforms, planned for implementation by 2001, are aimed at reversing the &quot;hollowing out&quot; of Tokyo markets.</p>
<p>Tokyo hopes the reforms will revive its status as a global financial centre by liberalising financial market commission fees and making effective use of Japan's massive individual savings, totalling 1,200 trillion yen ($9.91 trillion).</p>
<p>Chris Pavlou, treasurer at the HSBC Midland Bank Plc's Tokyo branch, said the firm also planned to expand in Tokyo in order to prepare for the Big Bang.</p>
<p>&quot;Now with the deregulation, we feel this is time for us to build our resources here... Hopefully, we will be ready when the deregulation comes,&quot; Pavlou said.</p>
<p>Andrew Simmonds, president and chief executive of BZW Securities (Japan) Limited, said the reforms may make the industry more competitive, but he is confident his company can cope because it went through London's 1986 Big Bang.</p>
<p>&quot;Big Bang is a beneficial exercise. It is good for our clients...then it must be good for us,&quot; Simmonds said.</p>
<p>BZW Securities, an investment bank belonging to the Barclays Group, has expanded its fixed income operations in Japan over the past six months, and recently strengthened its yen bond team in Tokyo by adding two traders.</p>
<p>&quot;All the banks that moved their operations to Singapore and Hong Kong...are going to think twice (about that in the next year or two),&quot; Midland's Pavlou said, adding that real estate costs in Japan are now lower than in Singapore or Hong Kong with the recent weakness of the yen.</p>
<p>But others said that this did not mean a shift away from Southeast Asian markets.</p>
<p>Yukuo Takahashi, a managing director at Chase Manhattan Bank's Tokyo branch, said his bank is enhancing operations in both Tokyo and Singapore.</p>
<p>But he said Tokyo is the place which has the critical prerequisites of a global financial centre.</p>
<p>&quot;Singapore, like other Southeast Asian markets, lacks a constant cash flow supported by business such as direct and securities investment and trade,&quot; Takahashi said. ($=121 yen)</p>
