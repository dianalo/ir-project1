<p>Zaire has ordered the expulsion of 40 U.N. relief workers who withdrew from the eastern city of Kisangani last weekend, saying their departure triggered the alleged slaughter of Rwandan Hutus and displaced Zaireans.</p>
<p>A government statement broadcast by state radio late on Tuesday said 25,000 civilians had been slaughtered since mainly Tutsi rebels overran the camp of Tingi Tingi on Friday. There has been no independent confirmation of such killings.</p>
<p>A total of 57 foreign U.N. and non-governmental organisation relief workers pulled out of Kisangani last Saturday, saying degenerating security and harassment by local military authorities made it impossible for them to work.</p>
<p>&quot;The precipitous departure of these humanitarian workers from the Tingi Tingi camp and the town of Kisangani...is considered by the government to be directly responsible for the slaughter which took place in less than 48 hours of 25,000 displaced persons and refugees,&quot; the government statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The government of the republic can no longer continue to condone the irresponsible behaviour of certain humanitarian agents...who have watched in silence during the massive killings committed by the Rwandan army in the refugee camps.&quot;</p>
<p>Zaire accuses the regular armies of Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi of fomenting the almost five-month-old rebellion in eastern Zaire and of actively participating in fighting on Zairean soil. All three countries deny the allegations.</p>
<p>A senior U.N. source in Kinshasa said U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan was intervening personally to try to reverse the government decision to expel the aid workers.</p>
<p>&quot;Kofi Annan himself is trying to negotiate with the government to turn the decision around,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of refugees fled Tingi Tingi camp in Zaire's equatorial rain forest, about 200 km (125 miles) southeast of Kisangani last Friday, leaving behind the sick and starving.</p>
<p>Journalists on Monday saw the fitter of them heading towards Kisangani, Zaire's third city, the provincial capital and headquarters for army operations in the war zone.</p>
<p>The Zairean government accused the U.N. workers of precipitating the flight of the refugees and of sowing panic in the region with frequent declarations in the media.</p>
<p>&quot;Many places in the east of the country have been emptied of their inhabitants and of soldiers before being occupied without fighting by the aggressors following alarmist rumour campaigns by these humanitarian agents,&quot; the government statement said.</p>
