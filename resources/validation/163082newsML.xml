<p>Slovakia and Hungary could reach an out-of-court settlement in their row over the controversial Slovak Gabcikovo dam project on the river Danube, a Slovak government official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Both sides think that there is room for an out-of-court settlement of the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros problem,&quot; Magda Pospisilova, spokeswoman for Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar, told journalists at the end of an informal bilateral meeting between Meciar and Hungary's premier, Gyula Horn.</p>
<p>The countries have fought over Slovakia's decision to unilateraly divert a considerable part of the Danube waters for its Gabcikovo dam project after Hungary quit a joint deal which planned a similar dam at Nagymaros in Hungary.</p>
<p>Slovakia claims Hungary breached its contract while the Hungarians say diverting the water breaks international law.</p>
<p>Both had agreed to bring thier case at the International Court in the Hague, which is due to consider it next year.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Horn said several Slovak proposals were sympathetic an that he could see areas of agreement on the Gabcikovo issue,&quot; Pospisilova said.</p>
<p>Meciar and Horn met after a trilateral meeting of the heads of governments of Austria, Hungary and Slovakia in the west Slovak spa town of Piestany.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting Horn, Meciar and Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, issued a statement in which they pledged to increase cooperation in battling organised crime, illegal migration and nuclear smuggling.</p>
<p>They also agreed to begin work on coordinated efforts to prevent money laundring and cross-boundary trafic.</p>
<p>Monday's meeting was the second trilateral session of the government heads of the three neighbouring countries, aimed at increasing coopperation in the region.</p>
<p>The three heads of governments also reviewed progress made in areas of cooperation in the energy sectors, development of transport infrastructure, joint-ventures, industrial parks and cooperation among their Danube harbours.</p>
<p>In bilateral talks, between Vranitzky and Meciar, the controversial Slovak Mochovce nuclear power plant was not discussed.</p>
<p>But in a news conference after the meeting of the three Vranitzky said he had presented Austria's view seeking the closure of Slovakia's aging Bohunice nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>&quot;Premier Meciar said Bohunice will be closed after the completion of the first two blocks of Mochovce (by 1999),&quot; Vranitzky said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not happy about this, but I'm glad the closure of Bohunice is a reality.&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Pospisilova said Meciar and Horn agreed to formally meet in Slovakia in early 1997 to discuss further bilateral issues.</p>
<p>These topics ranged from setting up a committee for minorities, to discussing new border crossing between the two countries and the contrustion of a bridge between Sturovo and the Hungarian town Esztergom.</p>
<p>On the question of a new law on minority language for Slovakia's 500,000-strong Hungarian minority, Pospisilova said Meciar had assured Horn that his government was working on an expert level to consider the merits of either amending existing laws, or drafting a fully new law.</p>
