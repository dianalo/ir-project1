<title>UK: NWE naphtha softens on crude, supply tight.</title>

<text>
<p>NWE naphtha waned on Thursday in line with lower crude prices, although many players said the picture was looking fairly tight on the supply side.</p>
<p>April swaps were quoted around $193.50/$194 and May paper was pegged 50 cents above there.</p>
<p>Traders said there were pockets of demand for high paraffinic material but supply was tight.</p>
<p>They pegged prices for the high paraffinic quality at around quotes cif hi +$3 and full range cargoes were assessed at $184/$190.</p>
<p>But overall, the scene was fairly dreary. &quot;There's not much product, but at the same time it's not as if I've got customers knocking at my door looking for material,&quot; said one refiner trader.</p>
<p>He said a number of end-users had turned to condensate, but noted that those that had not turned to alternative feedstocks had been out of the market for a long time and would probably need material soon.</p>
<p>Another trader said that condensate supply in the region was also looking rather tight, noting that 10 of the 12 cargoes in Algeria's April condensate programme were earmarked for U.S. destinations, while just two were headed for northwest Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the market is waiting for the market to bottom, but I don't think it's got that much further to fall. Refinery turnarounds are coming to an end and once the gasoline market gets going refiners will abandon much of their naphtha production,&quot; said one trader.</p>
