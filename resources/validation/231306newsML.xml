<p>The British pound fell sharply against other major currencies on Tuesday, after a top British official expressed concern about sterling's recent strength.</p>
<p>The pound slid against the mark, the yen and the dollar, falling to a one-month low versus the U.S. unit before ending the session at $1.6420/30, down from $1.6680/90 at the open.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling was absolutely crushed,&quot; said Ben Strauss, assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co. &quot;The last few weeks everybody has been buying sterling and selling almost everything else and all that was reversed with the most obvious impact on the yen.&quot;  </p>
<p>The impetus for the pound's decline came from British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, who said that British business was starting to fret about sterling's rise.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment our currency is strengthening very strongly and large numbers of British industries are beginning to get worried that we might get too strong,&quot; Clarke told Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Clarke also confirmed that Britain will be exempted from a proposed European stability pact in the run-up to a single European currency.  </p>
<p>The remarks added to the pound's woes because they meant that Britain will not be bound to the same strict fiscal discipline as other countries seeking to join European Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.</p>
<p>Further aggravating weakness in the pound were remarks from Bank of England Governor Eddie George, who said he was not surprised by sterling's downward correction. Talk that the British central bank was selling sterling to stem its recent rise also weighed on the currency.  </p>
<p>In other trade, the dollar was mostly lower, falling to 1.5560/70 marks from 1.5635/45 at the open, and sliding substantially against the yen to 113.35/40 versus 114.08/18.</p>
<p>Traders said the yen's strong performance against the pound contributed to weakness in the dollar/yen rate. They said a hesitancy to purchase dollars against yen at heady levels also contributed to the rate's decline.</p>
<p>&quot;People are afraid to be buyers up to the 115 level,&quot; said Strauss.</p>
<p>Against the mark, the dollar rallied to fresh 23-month highs overnight before succumbing to profit-taking.  </p>
<p>Early strength against the mark was fueled by comments from New York Federal Reserve President William McDonough and weak German industrial production numbers, traders said.</p>
<p>McDonough, speaking in Hong Kong, predicted the dollar would gain in status as European Economic and Monetary Union nears.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, German industrial production fell 1.8 percent in October after forecasters had predicted a modest rise. The weaker-than-expected numbers fueled talk of a German interest rate cut.  </p>
<p>&quot;The McDonough statements and industrial production numbers from Germany were the main reason why the dollar rallied overnight,&quot; said Brian McCarthy, market analyst at Ruesch International.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, speculation about an Australian interest rate cut took the dollar sharply higher against the Australian dollar. The Australian dollar ended at $0.8002/07, down from $0.8088/93.</p>
<p>The dollar closed lower at 1.3202/12 Swiss francs versus 1.3252/62 at the open. The dollar rose modestly to Canadian $1.3500/05 against C$1.3472/77.</p>
