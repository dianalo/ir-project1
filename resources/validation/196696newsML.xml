<p>Thailand's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Viravan Amnuay looks set to take a big role in the new coalition government.</p>
<p>Amnuay said on Monday in Hong Kong he was considering an offer from the winning New Aspiration Party (NAP) after Sunday's election to take over the economics ministry. In that post, he would also have responsibility for the budget.</p>
<p>&quot;Chances are that I will accept it, but I will not be able to say definitely until I meet all the coalition partners,&quot; Amnuay told reporters at the opening day of a three-day World Economic Forum meeting in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Amnuay said that if he took the post it would be as an independent, without any party affiliation.</p>
<p>Thailand's NAP  squeaked by its nearest rival, the Democrat Party, winning parliamentary elections by a two-seat margin on Sunday.</p>
<p>In addition to the NAP, the Chart Pattana, Social Action, Prachakorn Thai, Seritham and Muan Chon parties will join the new government. The parties have signed a pact to jointly nominate NAP leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh as prime minister.</p>
<p>The coalition, which would control 221 seats in the 393-member parliament, does not include the Chart Thai party led by caretaker prime minister Banharn Silpa-archa.</p>
<p>Amnuay said he had demanded political independence as a condition for accepting the post. In addition, he had to approve members of the economic team and direct economic policy for the coalition, he said.</p>
<p>The NAP had accepted these conditions, he said.</p>
<p>Thai stocks fell 58.39 points on Monday, or 5.83 percent, to 942.34 on disappointment that the Democrat Party did not win the election and form the new government.</p>
<p>&quot;They hoped to have the Democrats, but unfortunately the Democrats did not win,&quot; Amnuay said.</p>
<p>Amnuay acknowledged that the five major party leaders initially did not make a great impression after the elections. &quot;They were offering the same old liquor in the same old bottle with a new cap,&quot; he said. But Amnuay said that now that the coalition has been formed, the outlook was better.</p>
<p>&quot;The New Aspiration Party knew very well beforehand that it needed a new mix in the government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Amnuay said that while he would have preferred a coalition government to include the Democrat Party, he could still work effectively with members of the other parties.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't matter. I just want the best people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Amnuay was optimistic about the Thai economy. He said the exchange rate was not under any extreme pressure and that the current account deficit was manageable.</p>
<p>&quot;International lenders have been very happy to lend to us to build industry in Thailand and for infrastructure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also said that changing the currency basket against which the baht floats would create uncertainty in the market and should be avoided.</p>
<p>The new government would focus on stability over growth and continue policies of liberalisation, privatisation and decentralisation, Amnuay said.</p>
<p>Responding to concerns about Thailand's historically fragile political situation, Amnuay said the new regime should inspire confidence because of its commitment to political reform and its pledge to hold new elections once a new constitution is approved in the next 18-24 months.</p>
