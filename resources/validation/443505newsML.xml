<p>The flood of hot money out of the Swedish crown is set to continue, dampening chances of the rate cuts the central bank is keen to make, analysts say.</p>
<p>The crown slid to its worst levels in a year on Friday, in a sharp extension of the downtrend which has seen it shed more than six percent of its value against the mark since October.</p>
<p>Traders blamed speculative sales, mostly by foreign players.</p>
<p>&quot;It's nothing to do with fundamentals because you couldn't pick a country with better economic fundamentals,&quot; said Keld Holm, international economist at Lehman Brothers in London.</p>
<p>The crown fell to a session low of 4.5790 per mark in afternoon Europe from Monday's close here around 4.5060/90.</p>
<p>Swedish Finance Minister Erik Asbrink said he was not worried by the soft crown. &quot;With an inflation target and a floating crown this is something you have to be prepared for,&quot; he told journalists.</p>
<p>Traders said the market had taken this as a green light to sell more crowns -- though they doubted that was what Asbrink had intended.</p>
<p>&quot;The government wants rates to go lower and with the crown this weak the Riksbank won't cut rates,&quot; said Peter Lindquist, Nordic economist at HSBC Markets in Stockholm.</p>
<p>The market has been particularly chary of the Swedish unit since January, when Prime Minister Goran Persson pledged to spend 10 billion crowns on public services, Lindquist said.</p>
<p>Markets, fearing Sweden's two-year programme of fiscal toughness had been ended in a bid to woo voters, punished the crown on hearing of the plans.</p>
<p>Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, said this week that the crown was undervalued, but indicated that the currency had not yet reached a point where it had become a policy concern.</p>
<p>&quot;The Swedish crown is easy to pick on -- the Riksbank doesn't have the same commitment as other central banks to keep intervening because it's not in the ERM (exchange rate mechanism),&quot; said Lehman's Holm.</p>
<p>The Riksbank intervenes to smooth volatility rather than steer the crown, believing fundamentals will eventually drive it higher again, analysts said.</p>
<p>The weak crown has put the Riksbank in an awkward position. In January, deputy governor Lars Heikensten said the soft currency had contributed to the bank's decision not to cut its key interest rate, the repo, since December 17.</p>
<p>Until then, the bank had been easing frequently with 25 cuts from early 1996 when the the rate stood at 8.91 percent.</p>
<p>In fact, expectations are likely to lean towards tightening as Sweden's position outside the EMS makes open market intervention increasingly unsustainable, said Joe Prendergast, foreign exchange strategist at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Yet that speculation, plus mild recovery prospects and high real rates, are unlikely to benefit the crown, he believed.</p>
<p>Insufficient fiscal progress and a lack of credible fiscal retrenchment plans for the near future are seen preventing Sweden participating in European monetary union, even in the event of stronger political will, said Prendergast.</p>
