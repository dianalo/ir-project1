<headline>Aristide party gains in Haiti elections.</headline>
<dateline>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 1997-05-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Fanmi Lavalas party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide won two Senate seats outright in elections held in Haiti last month, according to official results announced on Friday.</p>
<p>The two Fanmi Lavalas candidates received a sufficent majority of votes in the April Senate and local elections to avoid a runoff. Fourel Celestin won the Southeast Department with 52 percent of votes and Joseph Yvon Feuille won the South, also with 52 percent.</p>
<p>Fanmi Lavalas is led by Aristide, a champion of the poor who was ousted by the military in 1991 and restored by a U.S.-led multinational intervention in 1994.</p>
<p>He was succeeded by Rene Preval following elections in December 1995, and formed Fanmi Lavalas in a split from the ruling Lavalas party.</p>
<p>Run-offs will be necessary in six of the seven remaining departments and will take place on May 25. Nine Senate seats were up for grabs in the April 6 election, which was marked by a low turn-out.</p>
<p>The Haitian Senate has 27 members.</p>
