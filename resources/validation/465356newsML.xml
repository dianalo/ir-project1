<p>Montgomery Securities Inc Senior Technology Analyst Tom Thornhill said personal computer shipments remain strong and technology share prices at current levels represent a &quot;buying opportunity.&quot; In a conference call with media, Thornhill said technology sector growth remains around 25 percent in real terms, with average selling prices in the sector down about 10 percent.</p>
<p>Thornhill said capital spending on technology is around the 20 percent range, well above spending on capital equipment in other sectors, which has been under the five percent level.  </p>
<p>&quot;The spending for high technology capital equipment is now growing by around 20 percent,&quot; said Thornhill, adding that this was up from its growth rate of about 15-20 percent through the 1995 to 1996 period.</p>
<p>&quot;In real terms, this has pushed technology to be about 40 percent of total capital equipment spending,&quot; Thornhill said, adding he believes the motivation for that trend is greater productivity and return on investment to corporate customers.  </p>
<p>For example, he said a recent survey by Deloite and Touche found that more than 80 percent of management in Fortune 1000 companies looks at technology spending as strategic rather than simply a cost to be controlled.</p>
<p>He and John Skeen, Montgomery's director of research, said that far greater returns on investment were driving the demand for technology, as well as new software applications which require increases in equipment performance requirements.  </p>
<p>&quot;While the technology sector is actually growing at close to 25 percent in real terms, we're also seeing ASPs, or average selling price, in these areas roughly down 10 percent,&quot; said Thornhill, adding this helped boost productivity.</p>
<p>Thornhill added that technology was growing by more than 20 percent while the remaining gross domestic product sectors were growing by less than two percent in real terms.</p>
<p>&quot;These are factors that we think will continue to drive technology as one of the better growth sectors in the economy,&quot; he said, noting that technology companies, by driving up volumes, are able to drive down prices of their products.</p>
<p>Skeen said Montgomery sees no particular enduring slowdown in the technology sector, concern over which has weighed on high tech stocks over the last week.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley markets guru Barton Biggs last week warned of the beginnings of a bear market for technology stocks, but the Montgomery analysts said they so no such apocalypse. &quot;We see that (the technology sector) ran into a pothole in the road last summer,&quot; he said in the conference call.  &quot;That didn't derail the business.&quot;</p>
