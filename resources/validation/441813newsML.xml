<p>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) caught financial analysts off guard on Thursday when it announced a surprise easing of monetary conditions.</p>
<p>The unforeseen move prompted short term interest rates to tumble almost quarter of a percent and the &quot;Kiwi&quot; dollar to dive nearly half a U.S. cent.</p>
<p>Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash, a powerful anti-inflation exponent, said monetary conditions had, since his last statement in December, become firmer than the central bank wanted.</p>
<p>&quot;In recent weeks, conditions have tightened further and have become inappropriately firm.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be looking to see conditions ease towards those we are seeking,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Many analysts expressed surprise at how vigorously the bank disapproved of the recent tightening in conditions, and some suggested the central bank was too optimistic about its chances of controlling inflation pressures over the next three years.</p>
<p>Since the December statement, short-term rates had risen to 7.6 percent from the RBNZ's desired 7.5 percent, while the Trade-Weighted Index, measuring the currency against a basket of currencies, had risen to 69.0 from the 68.0 assumed by the RBNZ.</p>
<p>Analysts generally believed the bank would sanction the tightening because the inflation outlook had deteriorated.</p>
<p>The bank lifted its forecast inflation track, but some economists doubt it was lifted enough.</p>
<p>Bank of New Zealand treasury economist Peter Jolly said inflation would not fall anywhere near as far as predicted, and said the RBNZ's was a &quot;very positive outlook&quot;.</p>
<p>ASB Bank economist Anthony Byett agreed inflation would come in higher than the bank expected.</p>
<p>&quot;The forecasts for 1998 are surprising, yes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The RBNZ sees inflation falling from 2.4 percent in 1996 to 1.2 percent in the March 1998 year and 1.1 percent in 1999.</p>
<p>It is mandated to keep inflation within a 0-3 percent band, after the new centre-right govnerment widened the band from 0-2 percent in December.</p>
<p>The RBNZ's economic projections are the first to take into account promises by the new government to stimulate the economy by spending an extra NZ$5 billion (US$3.5 billion) over the next three years, together with tax cuts in 1998.</p>
<p>Recent economic data has also suggested the fight against inflation is far from over.</p>
<p>Byett said the market would probably be wary about pushing rates back to December levels, in part because there would still be a credibility question about the RBNZ's inflation forecasts.</p>
<p>BNZ's Jolly expressed doubt that the currency's fall after the statement would be sustained.</p>
<p>The pressures were still on the upside, as interest rate differentials would still make the Kiwi attractive unless short rates fell to the mid-six percent area, he said.</p>
<p>Brash sounded a note of caution about the current account deficit which was projected to peak around 6.0 percent of GDP in 1999, from 4.6 percent currently.</p>
<p>Bancorp economist Stuart Marshall said the RBNZ's was a &quot;pretty extreme view&quot; on the current account and he questioned whether the deficit would reach those sorts of levels.</p>
