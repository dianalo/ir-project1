<p>Japanese corporate investment in China could dip this year, but for reasons that have little direct link with the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>Deng, whose pragmatic reforms propelled China onto the world stage as a major economic player, died late on Wednesday of complications from Parkinson's disease and a lung infection.</p>
<p>&quot;Deng's death will not have an impact since he already had relinquished power. But since last year companies have realised that it is tough to make money in China, so large-scale investment is declining,&quot; said Takashi Hoshino, an economist at LTCB Research Institute.</p>
<p>Japanese business leaders also said on Thursday that they foresaw little immediate change in China's policies.</p>
<p>&quot;China's development was carried out largely through his (Deng's) reform and liberalisation of the country,&quot; Kyodo news agency quoted Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of business lobby Keidanren, as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Even after his death, the basic policy of the nation will continue to prevail and the economy will continue to grow.&quot;</p>
<p>China's communist leadership is expected to close ranks following Deng's death, but power struggles may well be on the way as Beijing tries to deal with explosive domestic change.</p>
<p>But Japanese analysts forecast little longer-term shift in China's economic policies. &quot;Even if there is initial confusion (in China) we don't expect the system to change, so longer-term there is not likely to be much impact,&quot; said Hiroshi Honkawa, an official at the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO).</p>
<p>Still, Beijing's leaders face tough decisions on a whole range of issues affecting the country's 1.2 billion people and neighbouring countries, including whether to forge ahead with reform or to slow the pace.</p>
<p>&quot;As economic reform proceeded, problems have surfaced such as a widening income gap between rural and urban areas, social inequalities and economic-related political corruption,&quot; said Shokichi Takumori, chief economist at Sakura Securities, adding that how such issues would be handled was of keen interest.</p>
<p>All of which means cautious Japanese firms are likely to wait a while before making fresh investment decisions. &quot;They want to see how things go when China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in July, developments at the Communist Party Congress in October and what happens with U.S.-China relations, which are better but still fluid,&quot; LTCB's Hoshino said.</p>
<p>Japanese companies which flocked to China earlier in the decade have grown cautious over the past couple of years, in part because of China's whittling away at policies that promoted foreign investment with preferential treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend towards less preferential treatment for foreign firms will continue and problems remain unsolved,&quot; said Ryosuke Ikegami of the Japan-China Investment Promotion Organisation.</p>
<p>Japanese firms are disturbed less by the policy itself than by how it is being carried out. Among their irritations are Beijing's failure to deliver promised tax rebates for exports, arbitrary fees imposed by local authorities and the frequent failure of Chinese firms -- themselves strapped for funds under China's tight money policy -- to pay for goods and services.</p>
<p>Many companies have had to face the fact that doing business in China is fraught with pitfalls.</p>
<p>Supermarket chain operator Yaohan International, for example, said in December it would slow its China expansion because of problems in getting licences in new cities and the need for Yaohan China to rely on internal funds for expansion rather than on bank loans.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the pace of Japanese investment in China will slow down this year,&quot; said Honkawa. Japanese firms invested about $3.06 billion in China on a contract basis in the first half of 1996, compared with $7.58 billion in all of 1995, JETRO said.</p>
