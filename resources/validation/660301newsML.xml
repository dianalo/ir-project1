<title>UK: Cash Brent climbs towards IPE expiry, wet quiet.</title>
<headline>Cash Brent climbs towards IPE expiry, wet quiet.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>The North Sea Brent paper market strengthened on Friday ahead of the expiry of the July IPE contract at the close of trade, but activity on the wet market was stifled by a traders' gathering in Norway.</p>
<p>Brent intermonth spreads firmed in active dealing, with July/August changing hands at -32 cents before climbing to trade four times at -26 cents and at a high of -24 cents.</p>
<p>CFDs jumped some five to 10 cents across the board, with next week (June 16-20) talked at August Brent -54/52 cents, while the following week (June 23-27) was talked at -50/-47.</p>
<p>Outright levels for Brent surged 40 cents higher.</p>
<p>IPE July Brent was at $17.84 a barrel at 1209 GMT as traders covered shorts ahead of the contract expiry.</p>
<p>&quot;The paper is firmer on the back of the expiry of July and there's less Brent than people expected,&quot; said one paper trader.</p>
<p>The July Brent loading programme, released on Friday morning, scheduled the equivalent of 40.5 cargoes, compared to 38.4 cargoes in June.</p>
<p>The heavier programme was attributed to the longer month in July and a lighter maintenance schedule.</p>
<p>Some traders said they were expecting an even bigger jump in volumes, and the paper market was stronger as a consequence.</p>
<p>But others said the loading programme was broadly in line with expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;The majority of traders thought it was bang-on,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>But a slide in Gullfaks loadings by three cargoes to 21 cargoes in July was not anticipated by traders.</p>
<p>They said they were unaware of any maintenance plans which might account for the shortfall, but said it could be linked to technical problems at the Vigdis field.</p>
<p>The Statfjord programme scheduled 30 cargoes to load in July, unchanged from June.  </p>
<p>Talk on the wet market was extremely thin, with many traders attending a social gathering in Stavanger.</p>
<p>While much of the non-Brent overhang has now been cleared out, physical Brent cargoes were still plentiful, traders said.</p>
<p>Although one trading house was heard bidding on Thursday at July -55 cents, most traders still valued the market around the last done level of July -70 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;That bid looked artificial...it was something to do with a CFD play,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The final two full Brent cargoes from the June programme, loading 28-30, were turning wet on Friday. Another cargo may be put together from top-ups, traders said.</p>
