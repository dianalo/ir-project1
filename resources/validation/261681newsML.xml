<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross condemned the murder of six staff in Chechnya on Tuesday as a cowardly attack on the humanitarian group and said it was freezing its operations in the breakaway Russian region.</p>
<p>The U.N. refugee agency also announced it had frozen all humanitarian work for 80,000 displaced Chechens in surrounding areas after the killings, and the French medical charity Medecins du Monde said it too had pulled out of Chechnya.</p>
<p>Masked gunmen stormed into an ICRC compound in Novye Atagi village just southwest of Chechnya's capital Grozny at dawn and shot dead six Western staff, five of them women, as they slept.</p>
<p>It was the worst single assault on ICRC workers and the bloodiest attack on foreigners on Russian soil for many years.</p>
<p>ICRC head of operations Jean de Courten described the killings as a &quot;cowardly attack against the very foundation of the mission of Red Cross.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are all shocked,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a deliberate assassination of Red Cross people helping the wounded, an attack in a hospital, a cowardly attack in the middle of the night.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the organisation would have to consider whether to give armed protection to its workers in the field.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not use armed escorts. It's our principle. But when we're confronted with these new type of conflicts, we'll have to reassess this principle,&quot; De Courten said.</p>
<p>Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti condemned the killings in a statement and urged Russian and Chechen authorities to clarify the exact circumstances and bring the guilty to justice.</p>
<p>Cotti, the current chairman-in-office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which is involved in Chechen peace efforts, also appealed to all parties to support the peace process against the growing wave of violence.</p>
<p>The Geneva-based ICRC immediately announced it was freezing its operations in the breakaway region, swarming with arms, bandits and unfinished vendettas left over from 21 months of fighting between Russian troops and separatist rebels.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which has no staff in Chechnya itself, said it had halted its work in the neighbouring republics of Dagestan, Ingushetia and North Ossetia for security reasons.</p>
<p>High Commissioner Sadako Ogata voiced deep concern at lack of security for aid workers at Geneva talks with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasievsky, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>De Courten said nothing was stolen from the hospital and the ICRC did not know the motives behind the attack.</p>
<p>At the time of the attack the hospital, which had treated 2,000 people since opening in September, had 40 patients, both Russians and Chechens. Unarmed guards were outside the compound and all the 20 ICRC staff inside were asleep, the ICRC said.</p>
<p>The killings are a big blow to the ICRC, which has lost 49 staff members in attacks in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>The organisation looks after the sick, traces lost children, visits prisoners, helps mine victims, feeds the hungry and saves lives in the frontline of emergencies from east Zaire, Rwanda and Somalia to ex-Yugoslavia, Tajikistan and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In Burundi, ravaged by a vicious three-year war between the mainly Tutsi army and majority Hutu rebels, three Swiss ICRC employees were murdered in an ambush on a mountain road in June.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of security incidents against our staff members runs into pages,&quot; ICRC official Kim Gordon Bates told Reuters. &quot;But 1996 was the worst.&quot;</p>
