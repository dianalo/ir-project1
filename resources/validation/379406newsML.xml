<headline>UK's Labour asked to detail regulatory plans soon.</headline>

<p>The chief executive of IMRO, the self regulating body that oversees the UK investment management industry, called on Friday for the opposition Labour party to put forward quickly its plans for financial sector regulation.</p>
<p>Phillip Thorpe, addressing a business conference in a personal capacity, said the financial sector was aware of the need for change, but a lack of guidance could hamper the regulators' work over the medium term.</p>
<p>&quot;It must be hoped that Labour will be more explicit, and more explicit quickly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Thorpe noted with approval Labour's plan to streamline the regulatory system with perhaps one body replacing IMRO, the Securities and Future Authority (SFA), the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), and the Securities Investment Board (SIB), which oversees the other three.</p>
<p>Thorpe said Labour felt the present system was confusing for the consumer and investors from abroad, who did not know which self-regulating organisation was regulating what. &quot;I might say most of us in the system find it difficult,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Thorpe said a single intergrated body would be more efficient, and might be more effective in preventing problems from slipping between cracks in the system.</p>
<p>He also said it would lead a more level playing field, since under the present system a similar problem could give rise to four different solutions.</p>
<p>Against that, different sectors might really require different touches and he said Labour's proposals might mean &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; by &quot;a large and insensitive bureaucracy&quot;.</p>
