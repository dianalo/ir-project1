<p>Australian base metals group MIM Holdings Ltd is expected to notch up its first annual profit in three years on Friday, but a stronger Australian dollar is likely to cap any earnings turnaround, analysts said.</p>
<p>Base metal share analysts contacted by Reuters, forecast MIM would report a net profit before abnormals of between A$19.5 million and A$35 million for the year to June 30.</p>
<p>MIM's result would also be largely affected by equipment problems at its 70 percent owned McArthur River base metals operation in the Northern Territory and continued losses at its coal division, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Will Corkhill a metals analyst at Macquarie Equities, forecast a net profit before abnormals of A$31.3 million for 1995/96. MIM made a net profit before abnormals of A$23.1 million in the six months to December 31, 1995.</p>
<p>Corkhill said the profit would be lower in the second half due to the stronger Australian dollar, which has risen about seven percent to around 79 U.S. cents since January 1.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason for that is Aussie dollar copper prices are a lot lower than what they were in the first half,&quot; Corkhill said.</p>
<p>Copper makes up about 40 percent of the Brisbane-based miner's revenue.  </p>
<p>McIntosh Securities metals analyst Vicki Binns forecast MIM would report a net profit before abnormals of A$26 million for 1995/96. MIM reported a net loss before abnormals of A$38.00 million in 1994/95, up on the A$16.7 million loss in 1993/94.</p>
<p>Pru-Bache Securities base metals analyst Quek forecast a 1995/96 net profit before abnormals of A$35 million.</p>
<p>&quot;But I wouldn't be surprised if that came in below A$30 million,&quot; Quek told Reuters.</p>
<p>One Melbourne-based analyst forecast a net profit before abnormals of less than A$5.0 million for the second half and just over A$26 million for the 1995/96 year.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think their costs have crept up from what they are saying. It is very hard to judge what their tax rate is going to be. So on a post-tax basis we might get some surprises one way or another,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>One Sydney-based base metals analyst, who forecast a net before abnormals of A$19.5 million, said he had been lowering his forecasts due the continued operational problems, and the impact of the stronger dollar.</p>
<p>Analysts were consistent with their dividend forecast of 2.5 cents per share, level with a year earlier and also the first half of 19995/96.  </p>
<p>However, analysts were not going to estimate MIM's abnormal items, which produced a profit of A$43.4 million in the 1995/96 first half. But the miner has racked up abnormal losses of A$475.2 million in the past three years.</p>
<p>Analysts' said the MIM results would reflect an improvement at its key Mount Isa base metals mine in northwest Queensland, where production was distrupted by industrial action and operational problems for six months in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The worst is over for MIM in terms of where the company is going,&quot; the Melbourne-based analyst said. However, analysts said 1996/97 was unlikely to show a dramatic increase in profit.  </p>
<p>They said the copper price had fallen nearly 30 percent since mid-May and the Australian dollar remains high, which would put pressure on 1996/97 earnings.</p>
<p>MIM will not start to see a big growth in earnings until the 1998/99 year when the Ernest Henry copper/gold project in northern Queensland and the Bajo de la Alumbrera copper/gold project in Argentina come on stream.</p>
<p>MIM shares closed two cents higher at A$1.63 on Wednesday.</p>
