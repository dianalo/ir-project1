<title>CANADA: Canada's main political parties and their leaders.</title>
<headline>Canada's main political parties and their leaders.</headline>
<dateline>OTTAWA 1997-06-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The following five main parties are contesting the June 2 federal election in Canada:</p>
<p>LIBERAL PARTY- Led by Prime Minister Jean Chretien, the Liberals rode an anti-Conservative wave of anger in 1993, sweeping to power with a majority of 177 of 295 seats in the House of Commons after nine years in opposition, uncharacteristic for a party that has dominated Canada this century.</p>
<p>Chretien, 63, has an affable if colourless image of a small-town French-speaking Quebec lawyer. He has been in federal politics for three decades, most of them in cabinet positions, and has intimate ties to the business and political elite. Ironically he is reviled by many in his native Quebec. For most of his 3-1/2 years as prime minister he was popular in the rest of Canada, but his popularity has slipped during the past six months, especially in the latest 36-day campaign.</p>
<p>The Liberals slashed government spending and budget deficits, helping regain international financial respect. They have campaigned on staying the fiscal course until the deficit is gone, and then spending again -- with some money devoted to tax cuts and debt reduction -- when budget surpluses are eventually achieved. On social issues, they have tightened gun control, broadened homosexual rights and oppose any restrictions on abortion.</p>

<p>REFORM PARTY- A western-based protest party, it swelled from one seat to 52 in the 1993 elections and most analysts suggest it will form the official opposition. It has had difficulty expanding support beyond Alberta and British Columbia, especially in Ontario and the rest of eastern Canada.</p>
<p>Leader Preston Manning, 54, is the son of a popular Alberta premier and radio preacher. He has spent much of the last 3-1/2 years challenging Canadian political orthodoxy and trying to get the Ottawa media to take him seriously. He is sometimes likened to the U.S. independent presidential candidate Ross Perot for his twangy voice and outsider image.</p>
<p>Reform wants to cut the size of government even more than the Liberals did, to get to a balanced budget and tax cuts more quickly. Its positions on traditional values and getting tough on crime have sometimes earned it an &quot;extremist&quot; label, which it hotly denies. Reform has taken a hard line on Quebec separation, but also advocates decentralization to please both Quebec and other provinces.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>BLOC QUEBECOIS - A secessionist party devoted to the breakup of Canada and establishment of mainly French-speaking Quebec as a sovereign nation. The Bloc formed the official opposition after the 1993 election when it won the second highest number of seats in parliament at 54. Founded by the charismatic Lucien Bouchard, now premier of Quebec, it has struggled under the present leader, Gilles Duceppe. The Bloc ran a disastrous campaign at first but appeared to regain some support after Chretien declared he would not recognise a simple majority in any new referendum on Quebec sovereignty. Analysts do not expect the Bloc to return as official opposition but will be examining the vote for signs of strength of the Quebec secessionist movement.</p>
<p>Duceppe, 49, is a bilingual ex-Communist who has alienated some of the Bloc's more conservative supporters with a leftist economic message. An unfortunate but enduring campaign image was his donning a hair net during a cheese factory tour.</p>
<p>The Bloc's main message is separation from the rest of Canada and protecting Quebec's interests until then. It has pushed for higher capital gains taxes and lower unemployment insurance rates.</p>

<p>PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE PARTY - More widely known simply as the Conservative Party, some critics label it the Charest Party, since its campaign has focused on its youthful leader Jean Charest. The Conservatives have a history of alternating with the Liberals in running Canada. The party's biggest handicap is the memory of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who won the biggest majority in Canadian history in 1984 but stepped down in 1993 widely detested for perceived arrogance, corruption and unfulfilled promises. The once-powerful Conservatives were devastated in the 1993 election, winning only two seats in parliament.</p>
<p>Charest, 38, curly haired, telegenic and with a winning smile, speaks more eloquently than Chretien in both French and English. The former Mulroney cabinet minister refers to his vision for a united Canada but some question how much substance he has.</p>
<p>The party mimicked some of the policies of Reform in shooting for the right-wing vote, especially tax cuts and opposition to the Liberal gun control legislation. But it has a much stronger standing and historical base than Reform in Quebec and Atlantic Canada.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY - The only left-of-centre party taken seriously in Canada, the NDP has never formed a federal government but currently holds power in the provinces of Saskatchewan and British Columbia. The party had nine seats in the House of Commons during the last parliament, down from 43 seats previously.</p>
<p>The party is led by Alexa McDonough, the former leader of the provincial NDP in Nova Scotia. The media-savvy 54-year-old is eloquent and tough but has had a hard time being heard in an election campaign dominated by national unity.</p>
<p>The NDP has steered away from the debate about Quebec's position in Canada, focusing instead on how to lower Canada's high unemployment rate and raising taxes for corporations and rich Canadians.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>The new House of Commons is being expanded by six to a total of 301 seats, with Ontario and Quebec holding the lion's share at 103 and 75 respectively. The other provinces will have the following: British Columbia 34, Alberta 26, Saskatchewan 14, Manitoba 14, New Brunswick 10, Nova Scotia 11, Newfoundland 7, Prince Edward Island 4, territories 3.</p>
