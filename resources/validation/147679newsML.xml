<title>USA: Coffee prices soar as U.S. stocks evaporate.</title>
<headline>Coffee prices soar as U.S. stocks evaporate.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Coffee prices rose Monday amid growing concern about tight supplies worldwide.</p>
<p>&quot;There just is not any real amount of coffee around,&quot; said analyst Judith Ganes of Merrill Lynch. &quot;And there probably won't be for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Trade and speculative buying drove the December contract sharply higher as the market awaited weekly data on U.S. certified stocks, which was issued after the close.</p>
<p>The report showed a drop of 4,036 132-pound bags to just 1,547 bags and prompted New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange (CSCE) to seek more money from traders wishing to trade in the volatile December contract.</p>
<p>December coffee rose 3.10 cents to 119.10 cents a pound at the CSCE.</p>
<p>The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities rose 0.07 points to 243.33, bolstered partly by the rise in coffee.</p>
<p>Wheat prices fell again as the United States struggled to compete on the export market with rivals such as Argentina.</p>
<p>&quot;Wheat continues to react to the fact it is overvalued compared to world values,&quot; said Mark Cermak of Chicago trade house O'Connor and Co. &quot;Argentina is selling wheat and that has the Europeans putting on subsidies.&quot;</p>
<p>Memphis-based analytical firm Sparks Cos. also raised its estimate for Argentine wheat production for next year to 15.1 million metric tons from a previous projection of 14.25 million, further depressing the market's mood.</p>
<p>December wheat fell 7-1/2 cents to $3.82-1/4 a bushel at the Chicago Board of Trade, after hitting a peak of $7.50 a bushel earlier this year.</p>
<p>Gasoline prices ended higher in New York but crude oil and heating oil fell.</p>
<p>Gasoline for November delivery ended up 0.20 cent at 70.30 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange after prices rose to a six-month high of 71.75 cents a gallon. November heating oil ended off 0.26 cent at 71.46 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>December crude oil fell one cent to $24.85 a barrel.</p>
<p>&quot;People were looking for a reason to sell heating oil and buy gasoline, and the refinery problems were a convenient excuse,&quot; said Michael Rothman, senior energy futures analyst at Merrill Lynch, of gasoline's sharp intraday rise.</p>
<p>Environmental regulators said a valve failure caused an operation upset of gasoline making unit at Amoco Corp.'s 433,000 barrel a day Texas City, Texas, refinery. An Amoco spokeswoman declined to comment on the incident, except to say, &quot;This is part of day-to-day operations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The problem with the Amoco refinery is probably not that bad,&quot; said Rita Beale, an analyst with Fimat USA Futures.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lagoven, an affiliate of Petroleos de Venezuela, said that part of its Amuay refinery in Venezuala would be back online in three weeks after being shut due to problems with its compressor.</p>
<p>The Lagoven news combined with views that Amoco's refinery problems were minimal depressed prices, traders said.</p>
<p>Lagoven also reiterated that it would be able to meet supply contracts despite the shutdown.</p>
<p>&quot;The market turned south on a combination of refinery news,&quot; said a trader.</p>
