<p>Following is the full text of the Business Manifesto released by Britain's opposition Labour party on Friday:</p>
<p>LABOUR'S FIVE PLEDGES TO BUSINESS</p>
<p>1. Stable prices with a target to achieve inflation of 2.5 percent or less, tough rules on borrowing and spending, and no rise in income tax rates.</p>
<p>2. New drive for public/private partnerships to modernise, for example, the transport network.</p>
<p>3.A skilled workforce -- by cutting class sizes, setting new targets for literacy and numeracy and a new university for industry for lifelong learning.</p>
<p>4. Leading reform in Europe, promoting competition and opening markets so that British business gets the best deal.</p>
<p>5. Full backing for small business with legislation to end late payment to small firms and extra supporty to help small businesses grow.</p>
<p>Foreword By Gordon Brown Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer</p>
<p>When I became Shadow Chancellor in 1992,1 was determined to build a new relationship with business. lhy? Because I believed that government and business together had to face up to the challenge of a new global economy. And we had to equip ourselves for an ever more competitive future.</p>
<p>In a global marketplace, the old national economic policies - corporatism from the old left, isolationist ideology from the new right - no longer have any relevance.</p>
<p>In an economy characterised by continuous innovation and the need to adapt, old certainties such as jobs for life or a skill for life, or even a male-dominated industrial labour market, could no longer be taken for granted. Embracing change, and equipping people to meet the challenge of that change, is the only way we can provide opportunity for all.</p>
<p>For these reasons we rewrote our party constitution to show that a strong and cohesive society requires a dynamic market economy open to the rigours of competition and enterprise.</p>
<p>So, far from being in conflict, the interests of the Labour Party and the business community are in harmony. To bring about the fair and prosperous society that Labour seeks, we need successful and enterprising businesses making strong profits. All political parties including Labour, must support business, promoting policies which back British companies and industry.</p>
<p>Labour's programme is based on a clear analysis of what is required to help our businesses and individuals to prosper. It is business not government that creates lasting prosperity. The job of government is not to tell people how to run their businesses, but to do what it can to create the conditions in which business can thrive and opportunities for all can flourish.</p>
<p>Whenever I meet businessmen and women, we agree that there are many world-class British companies in which we take pride. But there are not enough of them. And the problem is that in many areas - our skills, our infrastructure, our levels of investment - we are not equipped for the future.</p>
<p>Britain can do better. In fact Britain does best when we allow our inventiveness and creativity to flourish, and nurture our instinct for hard work. A better-skilled workforce, a modernised infrastructure, encouragement for investment, help for small firms, more open and competitive markets in Britain and abroad and strong leadership in Europe. These are some of the things that a Labour government would encourage to help businesses succeed.</p>
<p>And we recognise also that there are certain preconditions necessary for success. We will take no risks with inflation, for economic stability is the precondition for business success. We will not impose burdensome regulations on business, because we understand that successful businesses must keep costs down. We will not try to second-guess investment and ocher decisions that business takes, because we know that business has the best idea of where its own interests lie. And we will not turn the clock back to the 1970s in industrial relations, because we know that flexibility is vital for businesses to prosper.</p>
<p>Labour's relationship with the business community has been transformed in recent years. Tony Blair, myself and members of the Shadow Cabinet have spoken with many thousands of businessmen and women up and down the country. It has been the biggest consultation exercise with business ever undertaken by a political party, culminating in the recent business summit between business leaders and members of the Shadow Cabinet.</p>
<p>We have learned a lot from these discussions. The outcome of the consultarion is reflected in this document. We hope to have the opportunity to continue this dialogue in government, working with business to meet the shared objectives of equipping our people for the future and building a more prosperous Britain.  </p>
<p>MANIFESTO IN FULL</p>
<p>This manifesto sets out how a new Labour government will work with business. It outlines our policies to back Britain's businesses and help them to compete and deliver healthy growth, good profits, rising living standards and more jobs.</p>
<p>Britain is a nation brimming with talent and potential. At their best our people demonstrate an unrivalled inventiveness and creativity. But too often in the past politicians have failed business and industry and squandered that potential. Unsound economic policies have led to repeated cycles of boom and bust. The old battles - public versus private, employee versus employer and state versus market - have prevented the development of a shared sense of national economic purpose about the need to create wealth.</p>
<p>A new Labour government will provide the vision and strong leadership needed to unlock Britain's potential and turn it into real achievement. At the heart of its approach will be a new partnership with business. It is not a question of picking winners'. What government should do, and a new Labour government will do, is create the dynamic and supportive environment in which business can prosper and thrive. An environment in which entrepreneurs with good business ideas have a real prospect of success and well-run established businesses can look to the future with confidence.</p>
<p>Over the past two years we have talked to business about what needs to be done to get the environment right. From macro-economic stability and education reform to more effective backing for science and technology and cutting red tape, we have published detailed proposal showing how government and industry working together can improve our competitiveness.</p>
<p>In the pages that follow we set out our business manifesto for a competitive Britain. It is not exhaustive. It does set out our priorities -- the basics we need to get right for business to be successful.</p>
<p>-- First, macro-economic stability with inflation low and government spending under control.</p>
<p>-- Second, a dynamic economy with higher investment, modernised infrastructure and competitive markets.</p>
<p>-- Third, stable and cooperative prices between employees and employers and a flexible labour market.</p>
<p>-- Fourth, improved education which business can prosper and and skills.</p>
<p>-- Fifth, a tax and benefit which entrepreneurs with good system which rewards work, encourages enterprise and promotes investment and saving.</p>
<p>-- Sixth, leadership by Britain in Europe.</p>
<p>We are ambitious for what needs to be done to get business and for Britain. We set ourselves the objective of putting Britain at the heart of of the emerging international economy. We want it to be seen as a great place to do business and the best place from which to compete internationally. We have great strengths. With vision and leadership, and a real partnership between government and business, Britain will succeed.</p>
<p>A PLATFORM OF STABILITY</p>
<p>Business needs stability to succeed. Too often in the past, British business has suffered from short term inflationary dashes for growth which have led to long-term damage to business confidence.</p>
<p>NO RISKS WITH INFLATION</p>
<p>A new Labour government will match the current inflation target. Our inflation target will be set to achieve underlying inflation of 2.5 per cent or Less. Interest rates will be set to meet that target.</p>
<p>We will take no risks with inflation. Low and stable inflation and sustained growth go hand in hand.</p>
<p>We will reform the Bank of England and the Treasury so that we can deliver our commitment to low inflation. The Treasury will receive advice from a new council of economic advisers to make policy-making more effective, open and accountable.</p>
<p>For the Bank of England, we propose a new monetary policy committee to decide on the advice which the Hank of Engiand should give to the Chancellor. The Court should also be reformed to reflect a wider range of interests, including those of industry.</p>
<p>A TOUGH APPROACH TO GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND BORROWING</p>
<p>We will meet the 'golden rule' of spending. Over the economic cycle, a Labour government will only borrow to finance public investment and not to fund public consumption. And the ratio of government debt to GDP will be kept stable on average over the economic cycle at a prudent and sensible level.</p>
<p>We will keep a firm grip on public spending. On spending, the first question any incoming government should ask about public spending is the question any management team would ask when taking over a business not how much more money spend but how we can ting spending better to meet our priorities.</p>
<p>We will work within the already announced ceilings for departmental spending for the first two years of a Labour government.</p>
<p>Labour's first Budget will not reopen overall spending allocations for the 1997-98 financial year. These are the figures upon which departments are already planning, and will continue to plan.</p>
<p>For 1998-99, each departmental minister will reorder spending so it meets our priorities of investment, employment and opportunity. Each department will save in low-priority areas to spend in high-priority areas.</p>
<p>Supporting this process will be a comprehensive spending review. It will immediately examine the allocation of total spending across departments and investigate how we can reshape the distribution of public spending now and into the next century.</p>
<p>PUBLIC SECTOR PAY</p>
<p>Labour will take a firm and fair approach to public sector pay. Decisions will be made with a view to retain, recruit and motivate staff. But these must be made within tough cash limits.</p>
<p>Under Labour, all public sector pay agreements must be financed from within the agreed departmental cash limits. Just as we will resist every other unreasonable demand on the public purse we will resist unreasonable public sector pay demands.</p>
<p>USING THE NATION'S ASSETS WISELY</p>
<p>As part of Labour's comprehensive spending review, we will also conduct a thorough and speedy national inventory of the assets owned by central government I departments and agencies to ensure they are using their assets efficiently.</p>
<p>Every central government department will draw up a comprehensive register of its assets by November of this year. We will increase disclosure of these departmental asset registers for public scrutiny as I part of the move to resource accounting. We will ask the National Audit Office to conduct value-for-money survey5 on key areas within asset-rich departments.</p>
<p>Our comprehensive spending review will begin work immediately to examine whether each department is using its assets efficiently and effectively, the scope for greater use of public/private partnerships and how value for money can be increased for the public purse. We will not hold assets that have no further use or allow the wasteful duplication of resources across departments. If there is no need for departments to hold property, land or other assets, they 'will be required to sell them.</p>
<p>STRONG LEADERSHIP FOR A REFORMED EUROPE</p>
<p>Europe is Britain's biggest market. Nearly 60 percent of our visible trade is with other members of the European Union And the opportunities for profitable business are growing in a market of 370 million consumers. British direct investment in other member states now exceeds our investments in the USA.</p>
<p>There are only three positions for Britain on Europe out; in but on the sidelines; or in and leading.</p>
<p>An increasing section of the Conservative Party favours the first option. But the economic consequences for Britain would be severe, including the threat to 3.5 million export-dependent jobs and much of our inward investment. The second is effectively where the current government finds itself. The BSE debacle is the most striking symbol of its failure.</p>
<p>The third - in and leading - is the option a new labour government will pursue, co-openting constructively with our partners rather than marginalising ourselves.</p>
<p>THE SINGLE MARKET</p>
<p>We want to reform Europe. Our agenda includes completion of the single market - in gas and electricity, in telecommunications and in financial services. The more Furope brings down internal trade barriers, the greater will be the benefits from increased competition, opportunities for restructuring, lower prices and more choice for consumers.</p>
<p>We will use Britain's presidency of the European Union in 1998 to speed up the completion of the single market. We will make June 1998 our deadline for its completion. Our objective is a genuine single market, free of the distortions of hidden barriers and unfair state aid.</p>
<p>We want to see all the member states effectively implementing the single market directives and introducing systems of remedy and enforcement.</p>
<p>In government, we will establish a British presidency working group, consisting of government ministers and representatives of business organisations. In preparing for the EU, the working group will discuss themes and policy initiatives to make the single market a reality and increase flexibility, productivity and employment.</p>
<p>We will make the EU more democratic and open, to prepare it for enlargement to the east. We will retain the British veto in areas that are important to our interests, such as taxation, defence and security, immigration, decisions over the budget and Treaty changes.</p>
<p>We will press for reform of the European budget, in particular through reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. We will support Treaty changes at the 1997 Intergovernmental Conference to fight fraud and impose penalties on member states that fail to ensure the lawful use of Community resources.</p>
<p>THE SOCIAL CHAPTER</p>
<p>We will sign the Social Chapter. We believe it is a sensible procedure for setting certain Europe-wide minimum standards. The Social Chapter has produced only two directives: the introduction of works councils for large companies operating across Europe and a right to unpaid parental leave. Neither would damage the competitiveness of British industry. In fact, despite our 'opt-out', a great many British companies are voluntarily including their British employees in their works councils. The Social Chapter has not been responsible for the level of social costs for employers in Germany, the laws on redundancy in Spain or the industrial relations rules in France These are all the result of domestic legislation.</p>
<p>We understand business concerns that in the future costly legislation could be imposed on Britain through the Social Chapter. But we have made it clear that in government we will not agree to extend qualified majority voting (QMV) to social security or co-determination in the boardroom. We will keep matters concerning pay and the right to strike outside the scope of the Social Chapter.</p>
<p>There is no appetite among other EU governments for significant new labour market legislation. Should any further proposals be made a new Labour government will make sure the issues of employability and competitiveness are central to the decision-making process.</p>
<p>THE SINGLE CURRENCY</p>
<p>Any decision about Britain joining the single currency must be determined by a hardheaded assessment of Britain's economic interests. There are formidable obstacles in the way of Britain being in the first wave of membership, if EMU takes place on 1 January 1999.</p>
<p>What is essential for the success of EMU is genuine convergence among the economies that take part, without fudging the rules. However, to exclude British membership forever would be to destroy any influence we have over a process which will affect us whether we are in or out. We must therefore play a full part in the debate to influence it in Britain's interests.</p>
<p>There are three preconditions which would have to be satisfied before Britain could join during the next Parliament: first, approval by the Cabinet, second, approval by Parliament and finally a 'yes' vote in a referendum of the British people.</p>
<p>PROMOTING COMPETITIVE MARKETS</p>
<p>Early in the life of a new labour government we will reform Britain's competitlon laws. Effective and fair competition is essential to nsure value and choice for consumers. And in the global marketplace, competition provides a spur to British companies to innovate and invest. Competitiveness abroad begins with competition at home.</p>
<p>The benefits of an effective competition policy are clear. But in the UK there is now a widespread consensus that our competition laws and institutions are not working well. The case for reform is strong: we need to prevent and remedy anti-competitive behaviour more effectively; there should be greater predictability; and there needs to be greater transparency along with a review of the extent of ministerial involvement in decision-making.</p>
<p>In reforming competition laws we will introduce a prohibitive approach to provide a strong deterrent against restrictive agreements and abuses of market power. We will also introduce more effective penalties against proven anti-competitive behaviour.</p>
<p>There is also a need to reform the institutions of competition policy to streamline procedures and avoid unnecessary duplication of investigations. We have appointed a panel of three 'wise men', led by Lord Borrie, a former director general of Fair Trading, to advise us how. They are also examining rules takeovers, including a review of the public interest test.</p>
<p>In the utilities industries we will promote competition where possible and more effective regulation where necessary. We want regulation which is fair both to consumers and share holders and gives managers every incentive to innovate and improve efficiency. We will also consider the appointment of non-executive advisers to work with each regulator.</p>
<p>In telecommunications all aspects of the industry are becoming increasingly competitive. We will encourage competition for the benefit of business and consumers through lower prices, improved quality and greater innovation.</p>
<p>We seek rapid development across the country of the high-grade networks necessary for interactive communications. So we propose, from 1998, to progressively lift the present restrictions on the ability of telephone companies, such as BT and Cable &amp; Wireless, to offer entertainment services over their networks.</p>
<p>Our objective is full competition throughout the country. In turn we will expect the telecoms companies to make broader-band communication links available, as far as practicable, throughout the country. The financial services industry is increasingly global. The City of London is established alongside New York and Tokyo as a world financial centre. It and the rest of the financial services industry are now major employers and earners of income from overseas.</p>
<p>As the guardians of other people's money there needs to be effective supervision and regulation of the industry. Good regulation, as well as guaranteeing probity, can also be a source of competitive advantage for the industry. Building on the present arrangements, we would give the Securities and Investment Board direct responsibility for the regulatory regime covered by the 1986 Act. We would also bring the sale of mortgages within this regulatory framework. We will ensure there is a framework of independent regulation for the 15 accountancy profession. We will review the laws on joint and several liability so that incorporation in this country provides accountants with adequate protection.  </p>
<p>HELPING SMALL FIRMS TO GROW AND PROSPER</p>
<p>Small and growing firms are the bedrock of a successful enterprise economy. Setting up and runnmg a small business takes hard work drive and imagination. A new labour government will give Britain's entrepreneurs and small businesses the backing they deserve.</p>
<p>Earlier this year we published Growing and prospering, our prospectus for small business. It sets out a comprehensive range of policies for backing small firms. The proposals include:</p>
<p>- new measures to tackle late payment, requiring government departments and local authorities to pay their bills on time and introducing a new legal right to interest on commercial debt</p>
<p>- improving the quality and effectiveness of business information and support available from the Business Links network, including a new Enterprise Zone internet site</p>
<p>- offering small businesses accessible and affordable training through a new University for industry and by means of individual Learning Accounts, to give training in business basics to people who want to start a new business for the first time</p>
<p>- co-operating with the banks to improve the loans to new high-tech start-up companies within the existing resources of the loan guarantee scheme</p>
<p>- giving small firms a strong voice on the low pay commission to advise on the national minimum wage</p>
<p>- cutting red tape and making sure up to half the members of the Deregulation Taskforce represent small firms.</p>
<p>A DYNAMIC ECONOMY</p>
<p>A Labour government will be vigorous in creating open and competitive markets at home and abroad. The message of history is that prosperity and the growth of trade and investment between nations go hand in hand. Protectionism may bring short-term benefits to vested interests, but for the nation as a whole it doesn't work.</p>
<p>Britain is the world's fifth largest exporter and importer British firms have notable achievements in export markets, but last year we ran an overall trade deficit of over 1 billion stg a month. There will be a new export initiative. To improve the focus of our efforts to back British business selling abroad we will bring together the relevant Whitehall departments with business in a new export forum. The forum's first task will be to undertake a candid assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of our current programmes and activities. We will be particularly keen to improve the advice and support available to the small and medium-sized (SME) enterprise sector, where recent figures show Britain ranks just 12th in the European Union league for the percentage of small firms who export. Drawing on this advice we will improve the co-ordination of government trade and export promotion to bener match the backing available in other countries.</p>
<p>As an early priority we will promote business secondments for Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) staff to improve their understanding of the needs of exporters. We will review the present government's decision to change the arrangements for supporting British participation in trade fairs and see how tomake trade missions more effective. And we will explore the appointment of leading figures from business, with proven export experience, as ambassadors to selected countries that are key export markets. We will provide vigorous support for the development of the World Trade Organisation. We want to see more effective action to tackle non-tariff barriers to trade and to open up the world's financial markets.</p>
<p>INWARD INVESTMENT</p>
<p>As well as being open and outward-looking in our trade relations we should be welcoming to inward investment. We have achieved real success in attracting inward investment over the past couple of decades. Inward investors are now responsible for about a quarter of value-added in manufacturing and are a significant force in such areas as cable communication, utilities and fmancial services.</p>
<p>Investors choose Britain because of our presence in the EU. The English language is an asset. Our workforce is adaptable and flexible. Local authorities demonstrate their enthusiasm for welcoming inward investors by speeding planning processes, improving roads and public transport and with a firm commitment to high educational standards. The fact that most of these local authorities are labour councils is a clear demonstration of our positive attitude to inward investment.</p>
<p>We propose new regional development agendes in England and the strengthening of the development agencies in Scotland and Wales. They will work with local authorities and the DTI to encourage further inward investment and to 'improve access to European funds.</p>
<p>IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF REGULATION AND REGULATING ONLY WHEN NECESSARY</p>
<p>Business values a clean environment and safe products. It doesn't seek wholesale deregulation, but regulation which is transparent and simple. Too often today regulation is overly complex and it sometimes imposes costs which exceed the benefits it aims to achieve. And although the present government has talked a lot about deregulation over the past few years it has introduced more than three times as many new regulations as it has removed.</p>
<p>We will reduce the demands for information central government makes on business by developing a common database available to all government departments. In local government we will build on our &quot;simplifying government' initiative. This has brought together Labour local authorities and business organisations, including the Forum of Private Business and the Federation of Small Businesses, to identify practical steps to streamline local government regulations and procedures. A new labour government will keep in place the Deregulation Taskforce, but make it more responsive to small business by increasing their representation on it.</p>
<p>BUSINESS AND THE ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Business has an important role to play in achieving a clean environment, but protection of the environment also represents a big economic opportunity. Environmental industries are sector of growing value and employment. Effective environmental management is an increasingly important component of modern business practice. It brings benefits such as less waste, less energy and reduced toxic emissions. It can also act as a catalyst to the development of new products, new management systems and new services. The CBI has argued that: &quot;The environment is not something to be treated separately, but forms part of a culture of efficiency and innovation.&quot;</p>
<p>There is great scope for UK companies to exploit the growing markets in new clean technologies and management systems. A new Labour government will encourage British businesses in this area. We will support new initiatives to promote cleaner, more efficient energy use and production, and use the tax system to discourage environmental pollution.</p>
<p>INNOVATION, DESIGN, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p>Science and technology, along with innovation and design, are at the cutting edge of achieving greater competitiveness. They need to be at the centre of government thinking, policy-making and action too. Our key policies include:</p>
<p>- recognising the importance of a strong science base to competitiveness</p>
<p>- broadening the A-level curriculum so more students study science and technology-based subjects</p>
<p>- taking forward the Technology Foresight initiative, improving support for high-tech start-up companies, and supporting and encouragitig the work of the Design Council in the dissemination of best practice.</p>
