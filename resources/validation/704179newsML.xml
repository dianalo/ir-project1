<p>The British Lions have made four changes in their side for the final test against South Africa at Ellis Park on Saturday.</p>
<p>Injuries accounted for three of the changes, with Mike Catt replacing Gregor Townsend at fly-half, Tony Underwood coming in for Alan Tait on the left wing and Mark Regan replacing Keith Wood at hooker.</p>
<p>The fourth change sees Neil Back preferred to Richard Hill on the flank.</p>
<p>The changes mean the Lions will field 10 Englishmen at Ellis Park. Catt said: &quot;It's the opportunity of a lifetime for all of us. Walking onto Ellis Park with a Lions jersey on as a representative of northern hemisphere rugby is something I've never even dreamed about.&quot;</p>
<p>Catt is in because Townsend aggravated a thigh strain in training on Wednesday, while Tait and Wood both picked up groin strains in the series clinching 18-15 win in the second test .</p>
<p>Underwood, whose elder brother Rory won Lions test caps in New Zealand and Australia on the last two tours, picked up the confident mood of the camp when he said: &quot;We intend to rub salt into springbok wounds on Saturday.&quot;</p>
<p>Regan, the Bristol and England hooker, has beaten off the challenge of Barry Williams. Regan said: &quot;All 35 players in this squad have pushed each other to new heights. I've had to cope with being left out, but it's a never say die thing and I always thought I had a chance of playing.&quot;</p>
<p>Injuries have also forced changes among the substitutes with thigh strains for both Jason Leonard and Eric Miller ruling them out.</p>
<p>Team: 15-Neil Jenkins; 14-John Bentley, 13-Jeremy Guscott, 12-Scott Gibbs, 11-Tony Underwood; 10-Mike Catt, 9-Matt Dawson; 8-Tim Rodber, 7-Neil Back, 6-Lawrence Dallaglio, 5-Jeremy Davidson, 4-Martin Johnson (captain), 3-Paul Wallace, 2-Mark Regan, 1-Tom Smith.</p>
<p>Replacements: Tony Stimpson, Alan Bateman, Austin Healey, Barry Williams, David Young, Richard Hill.</p>
