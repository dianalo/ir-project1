<p>The Thai overnight interbank rate rose to 13.00-13.50 percent in late trade on Thursday from 12.25-12.50 earlier on tighter liquidity, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand for funds was very high today especially from finance firms. Most finance firms were borrowing funds to meet the reserve requirement due today,&quot; said one dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>Finance companies have to meet the Bank of Thailand's reserve requirement every Thursday.  </p>
<p>Dealers said a smaller amount of funds lent into the market by state-run Government Saving Bank, a major market lender, was another factor that tightened money supply.</p>
<p>The finace ministry on Tuesday assigned the Government Saving Bank to set up a 10-billion-baht fund to be used to buy stocks that might be forced sold by brokerages on the depressed stockmarket.</p>
<p>The baht firmed to 25.377-25.387 to the dollar late from 25.385-25.390 earlier as the dollar eased abroad, dealers said.  </p>
<p>The one-month swap premium was at 11.00/11.50 satangs per dollar late compared with 9.75/10.50 earlier.</p>
<p>The tightness in baht supply and rising short-term money market rates were cited as reasons for the higher premiums.</p>
<p>The mid-rate was fixed at 25.38 to the dollar against 25.37 on Wednesday. It was the lowest fix since July 15.</p>
