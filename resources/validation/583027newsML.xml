<headline>Italian shares end higher following Dow and BTPs.</headline>
<text>
<p>1520 GMT - Italian stocks ended firmer near the day's highs helped by the rise in Wall Street and the rally on BTP domestic bonds, with banking stock Credito Italiano shares rising sharply after a meeting with analysts earlier today, dealers said.</p>
<p>* Dealers added that Milan stocks had started slightly firmer but then took good support from the rise on the Dow Jones index and BTPs, while Credito Italiano rose after an analysts meeting in London yesterday where the bank said its prospects for 1997 were very good.</p>
<p>* The all-share Mibtel index ended up 0.8 percent at 12,426 and the Mib30 blue chip index was 0.98 percent higher at 18,585.  </p>
<p>* Credito saw its highest volumes of the year with 57.1 million shares traded, and ending up 5.77 percent at 2,602 lire. Among other banks Rolo Banca, where Credito has a controlled stake, ended up 2.85 percent at 18,070 lire, while Banca Commerciale Italiana ended 2.07 percent higher at 3,795 lire.</p>
<p>* &quot;The U.S. data obviously helped stocks with tame inflation figures pushing up Wall Street,&quot; said one share dealer.</p>
<p>* U.S. producer price data for April showed a fall of 0.6 percent, the largest drop since August 1993, after an expected annual rise of 1.5 percent.  </p>
<p>* Telecoms saw some good buying interest from international investors, dealers said. Telecom Italia ended up 0.71 percent at 4,686 lire, TIM closed 1.38 percent higher at 5,212 lire and STET closed 0.64 percent at 8,356.</p>
<p>* Among the smaller stocks, Autogrill ended firmer after meeting analysts and giving what they described as an upbeat presentation. The shares ended up 6.05 percent at 2,613 lire.</p>
