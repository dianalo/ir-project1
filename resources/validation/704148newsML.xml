<p>Australian Todd Woodbridge battled through to the Wimbledon semifinals on Thursday beating young German Nicolas Kiefer in four sets.</p>
<p>Woodbridge, half of the highly successful doubles partnership with compatriot Mark Woodforde, finally buried the German 7-6 2-6 6-0 6-4 in a match abandoned for over two and a half hours because of occasional drizzle.</p>
<p>The closely fought first set was marred when Kiefer received a warning in the tie break. He bounced his racket across the court when a lob failed get past Woodbridge who smashed the ball way out of Kiefer's reach.</p>
<p>At 7-7 Kiefer attempted to serve and volley, only to fall hard at the net and allow Woodbridge to serve for the set, an opportunity which the Australian duly grasped.</p>
<p>A displeased Kiefer insulted the referee as he walked off at the end of the set, put out that Woodbridge had not received a similar warning for narrowly missing a line judge when he flung his racket earlier in the set.</p>
<p>&quot;He threw his racket and didn't get a warning. I got a warning for nothing,&quot; the peeved German said afterwards.</p>
<p>Apart from the second set blip, the Australian looked the more confident, more controlled player and cruised through the third set without conceding a single game.</p>
<p>&quot;He doesn't play very fast tennis, but he's very clever,&quot; Kiefer said.</p>
<p>Kiefer got off to a bad start in the fourth set, losing his serve in the very first game, but he looked livelier in the second game when he broke back. The break relaxed him and he went on to take the next game as well.</p>
<p>But while there were moments of brilliance -- in the fifth game Kiefer twice lobbed his opponent from the net then served an ace to go 3-2 up -- the German's game was punctuated all too often with unforced errors.</p>
<p>When play was resumed, the score at deuce with Kiefer leading 4-3 in games, the sun was shining on the Australian. Spurred by vociferous support from an Antipodean contingent in the crowd, Woodbridge wasted no time in wrapping up the match.</p>
<p>Woodbridge has surpassed himself in the singles tournament this year, his previous bests being two third round appearances here in 1995 and 1991.</p>
<p>He now meets world number one Pete Sampras in the semifinals.</p>
<p>&quot;I think he (Woodbridge) has a good chance,&quot; Kiefer said.</p>
