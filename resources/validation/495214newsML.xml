<p>New Zealand exports of wool to China, by far its biggest customer, have plunged in the last two months, Wools of New Zealand (WNZ) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>However, WNZ, a farmers' co-operative with monopoly selling rights, said it was not panicking as the slack was being taken up by European buyers, particularly Britain and Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last couple of months there has been quite a significant drop-off compared with the same period last year and the result is that shipments to date this season to China have come down 29 percent,&quot; Corporate Relations Manager Roger  </p>
<p>Buchanan told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is noticeable when your major buyer, particularly one which is taking in excess of 30 percent, makes any significant change, say five or 10 percent, in their purchasing level.</p>
<p>&quot;That has a very direct bearing upon what happens in the auction price.&quot;</p>
<p>Buchanan said in the last year as China had backed off there had been a very bearish effect on wool prices  </p>
<p>But he added, &quot;Encouragingly, in the last two or three months we have seen quite a significant increase in uptake by the U.K. and other European markets.&quot;</p>
<p>Wool prices this season, starting July 1, 1996 have averaged NZ$4.51 per kg clean, down 9 percent on last season, and this month's price is down 34 percent from two years ago.</p>
<p>Farmers' returns from wool have been also hit by a rising New Zealand dollar which has firmed by 28 percent over the past four years on the U.S. dollar and 3 percent in the last year.</p>
<p>Buchanan said the steady downward price trend in the last year and half had paralleled the decline in purchases by China.  </p>
<p>New Zealand exported between 65,000 and 75,000 tonnes of wool to China in each of the the last two seasons.</p>
<p>The pattern of New Zealand's trade with China contrasts with Australia, however, where exports rose 64 percent in the last six months of 1996.</p>
<p>New Zealand exports mainly crossbred wools used for hand knitting yarn while Australia's fine wools are used mainly for woven worsted fabrics.  </p>
<p>Uruguay has also increased its business to China recently, but Buchanan could not say whether that had was connected to reported Chinese complaints that some New Zealand shipments did not fit the exporter's description.</p>
<p>China has always being a somewhat erratic purchaser of New Zealand wools and some traders have suggested a change to its tariff regime, as China applies for membership of the World Trade Organisation, may have slowed some of its buyers.</p>
<p>Buchanan describes the tariff situation as &quot;fluid&quot;.  </p>
<p>State-owned enterprises pay a five percent tariff while others pay 10 to 15 percent, and all have to pay a further 17 percent of value added tax on top.</p>
<p>&quot;It provides some incentive to find creative ways of importing wool,&quot; Buchanan said.</p>
<p>New Zealand total volume shipments for the season are up 1.0 percent on last year although returns are down 10 percent.</p>
<p>Despite the weak prices, Wools of New Zealand is not gloomy about the outlook, and is already seeing reasonable forward order volumes, indicating firm demand, he added.  </p>
<p>WNZ believes New Zealand wool is competitively priced and a pickup in European economies, with the textile industry at the forefront, will underpin the price.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of the outlook does revolve around China. We suspect this a relatively temporary glitch in terms of demand from China,&quot; Buchanan said.</p>
