<p>Australia's worst shooting massacre in modern history began on a crisp, sunny, autumn Sunday in April on the tranquil island state of Tasmania. Within 24 hours, 35 people were dead and a whole nation was in mourning.</p>
<p>According to survivors of the massacre at the historic former penal colony of Port Arthur, a lone gunman simply went beserk after quietly finishing his lunch.</p>
<p>Shortly after 1.30 p.m. on April 28 the gunman walked inside the Broad Arrow Cafe and starting shooting, they say.</p>
<p>Minutes later 20 people were dead, some where they had sat eating their lunch.</p>
<p>Survivors told a terrifying story of a man who reached inside his tennis bag, pulled out a semi-automatic rifle and began shooting indiscriminately.</p>
<p>Those who pleaded for mercy attracted the gunman's attention and his deadly wrath, survivors said.</p>
<p>Outside the cafe, the tourists continued sightseeing or picnics unaware of the carnage. Many said they thought the gunshots were part of a stunt or a convict re-enactment and some even hurried towards the cafe to see the attraction.</p>
<p>As the gunman left the cafe, he began shooting at cars and buses and fleeing tourists. Witnesses said the gunman seemed relaxed and focused as he shot.</p>
<p>After killing five more people, including a tour bus driver, the gunman drove off, but stopped a short distance later.</p>
<p>Nanette Mikac was fleeing, carrying her three-year-old daughter Madeline in her arms, and her six-year-old daughter Alannah.</p>
<p>The gunman shot and killed Mikac and Madeline. Alannah ran into the bushes and crouched behind a gum tree. The gunman stalked her to her hiding place and shot her.</p>
<p>Within an hour the death toll was 32.</p>
<p>The gunman then took three people hostage and drove to a nearby guest house where he kept police at bay until Monday morning when the cottage burnt down.</p>
<p>The charred remains of the three hostages in the rubble of stone and twisted metal brought the death toll to 35.</p>
