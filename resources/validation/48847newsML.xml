<p>-----------------------MARKET COMMENT-------------------------</p>
<p>* Canada dollar closes slightly softer at C$1.3718 (US$0.7290) from Wednesday's finish of C$1.3711 (US$0.7294) in quiet trading.</p>
<p>* Market players awaiting Canadian consumer price index numbers to be released Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>* A Royal Bank report forecasts a stronger Canada.  </p>
<p>&quot;Beginning in 1997, Canada is set to grow faster on a real basis than any other G7 country,&quot; the report said. &quot;At the same time, we expect the Canadian dollar to rise.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada has worked to keep inflation down while making dramatic improvements in the current account since 1990.</p>
<p>Low inflation and the recent current account surplus will also add up to a stronger Canadian currency, the bank said.</p>
<p>The report predicts real interest rates will continue to fall in Canada as markets acknowledge the change in Canada's economy. Lower real rates are &quot;key to Canada's approaching economic outperformance,&quot; the report said.  </p>
<p>Real rates have already fallen by 200 basis points in the last 20 months. The bank forecasts a continued fall by as much as 150 basis points.</p>
<p>Such a fall would put real rates in Canada after inflation about 100 basis points above U.S. rates.</p>
<p>&quot;With such a signficant decline in real rates in Canada, private investment will likely rise sharply,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Rising private investment will create conditions for sustainable growth in full-time employment in 1998 and 1999 and lead to a rise in personal consumption, said the report.</p>
<p>There is little risk of inflation, it predicted.  </p>
<p>Slack in Canada's labor market means a low risk of inflation until the turn of the century, the paper stated.</p>
<p>&quot;Thus, the Canadian economy is likely to grow for three years at almost twice the potential growth rate of the G7 (2.2 percent) without inflation and without a significant increase in interest rates,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Canada will also attract more foreign investment as U.S. companies rush to invest in the improving Canadian environment, the report said.</p>
<p>On the crosses, the Canada rose to 1.1024 marks from 1.1015 marks, but slid to 80.27 yen from 80.47 yen.</p>
