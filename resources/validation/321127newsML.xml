<p>The Albanian government decided on Tuesday to form a commission to investigate the get-rich-quick investment schemes that have ruined thousands of small investors and set off a rash of street protests.</p>
<p>Hundreds of out-of-pocket Albanians converged on pyramid investment offices in Tirana on Tuesday, desperate to retrieve their savings.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, thousands of investors staged demonstrations in Tirana and other major cities in this impoverished Balkan nation, blaming President Sali Berisha's right-wing government for doing too little to regulate a post-communist explosion of unsound financial schemes.</p>
<p>Berisha vowed last Saturday to crack down on the schemes and warned the opposition against exploiting the ire among investors to try to destabilise the state.</p>
<p>Radio Tirana reported that a special government commission would evaluate the actual extent of lending to such schemes and recomment measures to help secure investors' money.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi said the government would compile a law based on the commission's findings and would present it to parliament by Monday to bring a halt to pyramid-style borrowing schemes.</p>
<p>&quot;With this law we aim at giving a global solution for each case, so that everyone has the same compensation from the division of the properties of these companies,&quot; Meksi told Albanian television.</p>
<p>Pyramid schemes burgeoned in Europe's poorest country after the fall of communism in 1990, luring thousands of Albanians into selling their homes, land and livestock with promises of big returns.</p>
<p>Three pyramid schemes have failed so far, leaving thousands out of pocket. Four more have suspended payments to investors.</p>
<p>The Albanian government on Thursday ordered the seizure of 25.5 billion leks ($255 million) deposited by such schemes in state-owned banks.</p>
<p>Last week's demonstrations were broken up by the police and newspapers reported scores of arrests. Western diplomats in Tirana said they were watching developments with concern.</p>
<p>&quot;The government should find a way out not only to calm people but to help them get back at least to last year's financial situation. Otherwise it will have a lot of social problems,&quot; said one diplomat, who declined to be named.</p>
