<p>A sergeant at the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground was charged with rape and other crimes in connection with a sexual misconduct probe at the base, the Army said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Staff Sgt. Vernell Robinson, 31, is the third soldier charged with rape in connection with the probe. Four others have been charged with lesser forms of sexual misconduct.</p>
<p>Robinson, trained as a mechanic, was a drill sergeant at the proving ground's Ordnance Centre and School, with supervisory capacity over trainees' non-school activities, base spokesman George Mercer said.</p>
<p>&quot;In many ways the drill sergeant is the father and mother,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The proving ground said in a statement that Robinson was charged with one count each of rape, sodomy, extortion, assault, indecent assault, making threats, and failing to obey an order. He also was charged with three counts of obstruction of justice and eight counts of failing to obey a regulation.</p>
<p>The sexual misconduct charges involve seven female trainees at the facility, the proving ground said. The count of failing to obey a regulation also involved a male trainee with whom Robinson improperly consumed alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>The new case brought to seven the number of staff at the school charged in connection with a sexual harassment scandal that erupted last November.</p>
<p>One of those, who was charged with sodomy, adultery and other violations, received an early discharge in lieu of a court martial. The others are awaiting courts-martial, except for Robinson, whose case remains at an early stage.</p>
<p>A decision had not yet been made as to whether the charges against Robinson will warrant a court martial, the proving ground said.</p>
<p>In addition, three other staff members of the school have received non-judicial punishment and a fourth was found not guilty.</p>
<p>Mercer said about 18 other staff members were subjects in the continuing investigation into sexual misconduct at the base. Of those charged, one is a commander, two are instructors, and the remaining four are drill sergeants.</p>
<p>The proving ground said in a statement, &quot;The Ordnance School continues to follow the three primary objectives set by its commander, Maj. Gen. Robert D. Shadley, at the beginning of this investigation: identify and care for the victims, investigate all allegations to the fullest extent, and pursue due process when required, and identify systemic causes and apply corrective action to prevent further incidences of sexual misconduct.&quot;</p>
