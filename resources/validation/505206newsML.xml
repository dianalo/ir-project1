<headline>Inktomi in funding round, targets Net traffic jams.</headline>
<dateline>BERKELEY, Calif. 1997-04-13</dateline>

<p>Inktomi, known for supplying the search engine technology for Wired magazine's on-line service, said on Sunday it has raised $8 million in venture funding and will target network traffic problems.</p>
<p>&quot;We view ourselves as a high-performance technology company. We build software to solve big problems,&quot; said Kevin Brown, marketing director of Inktomi.</p>
<p>Brown said the company is now concentrating on developing network caching servers which can be used to improve the amount of data that can be sent across corporate networks and the Internet.  </p>
<p>Such technology could be used to unclog &quot;a staggering amount of traffic that is bogging down on (organizations') networks and the Net,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Inktomi executives have said for nearly a year they intended the search engines they had set up to be more of a showcase for further product initiatives using its clustering technology for heavy-duty networking.</p>
<p>In addition to supplying technology for the HotBot search engine for Wired magazine's HotWired service, Inktomi has clinched similar search engine deals with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and Australia's OzEmail Ltd.  </p>
<p>Brown said the amount of redundant traffic crossing the Internet multiple times to different users, for example, demonstrated this was an area of networking which was &quot;screaming out for optimization.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown cited one Internet service provider he said was spending $1 million a day on new equipment to support this type of traffic, which could be more intelligently used.</p>
<p>Where a typical server -- the computing device that runs networks of computers -- might store five to 10 gigabytes, or billion bytes of information, Inktomi could store and access more than a terabyte, up to 200 times as much, or the equivalent of 10s of millions of pages.</p>
<p>These products will be available in the second half of the year, he added.</p>
<p>The company, which was started with financing from individuals in Florida and Texas, said it has raised $8 million in a first venture round from Palo Alto, Calif.-based Oak Investment Partners.</p>
<p>Brown said Inktomi, which was founded by computer engineers from the University of California at Berkeley, will move to San Mateo, Calif., south of San Francisco.</p>
<p>It currently has around 40 employees. ((sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400))</p>
