<p>The chase for the Stanley Cup got underway Wednesday, and the Colorado Avalanche began their National Hockey League title defence in impressive fashion with a 6-0 rout of the Chicago Blackhawks.</p>
<p>The incomparable Patrick Roy made 22 saves for his ninth career playoff shutout and Peter Forsberg scored twice for Colorado as four best-of-seven Western Conference playoff series opened up Wednesday.</p>
<p>Roy, hockey's greatest big-game goaltender, extended his post-season scoreless streak to 213 minutes, 11 seconds in posting his 87th career playoff win, moving him within one of former Islander Billy Smith for the all-time lead.</p>
<p>Sandis Ozolinsh, Mike Ricci and Claude Lemieux each had a goal and an assist and Adam Deadmarsh contributed three asssists for Colorado, which finished the season with the best record in the league and is trying to become the first repeat Stanley Cup champions since the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1992.</p>
<p>Chicago gave the Avalanche an unforgivable 12 chances with the man advantage and Colorado cashed in three times as Ozolinsh, Forsberg and Lemieux scored powerplay goals.</p>
<p>Chicago goaltender Jeff Hackett made a phenomenal diving save of a Forsberg shot to preserve a scoreless tie early in the game. But he was victimised by four Avalanche goals later in the first period and was replaced Chris Terreri after giving up Colorado's fifth goal at 16:14 of the second.</p>
<p>Mike Keane scored the first goal for Colorado at 5:54 of the first period, giving Roy all the offence he would need.</p>
<p>In Detroit, Grant Fuhr recorded his fourth career playoff shutout and Geoff Courtnall and Pierre Turgeon scored first-period goals as the St Louis Blues blanked the Red Wings 2-0 to draw first blood in their opening-round series.</p>
<p>Fuhr made 30 saves, including 15 in the third period, for his 79th career playoff win, moving him within one of the great Ken Dryden for third place on the NHL all-time list.</p>
<p>Brett Hull assisted on both St Louis goals.</p>
<p>On the first goal 12:44 into the contest, Hull centred the puck through a maze of players to Courtnall, who chipped a shot from the top of the crease over goaltender Mike Vernon.</p>
<p>Turgeon made it 2-0 in the final minute of the period on one of the Blues' nine power plays, deflecting Al MacInnis's slap shot past Vernon.</p>
<p>Detroit went 0-for-8 on its own power play.</p>
<p>Vernon, who got the start ahead of Chris Osgood, finished with 25 saves and kept Detroit in the game with 21 stops after the opening period.</p>
<p>In Dallas, Mike Modano scored with 2:31 left in the third period to break a 3-3 deadlock and lift the Stars to a 5-3 victory over the Edmonton Oilers.</p>
<p>Jere Lehtinen's shot was stopped by Curtis Joseph, but Modano retrieved the rebound in the slot and put a high shot into the far side of the net for a 4-3 Dallas lead.</p>
<p>Brent Gilchrist added an empty-net insurance goal for the Stars, who finished atop the Central Division with 104 points after ending up in last place in the division last season.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a great goal for Modano,&quot; said Stars coach Ken Hitchcock. &quot;This series is going to be a war. It's gonna be a fun series to coach in and a fun series to play in.&quot;</p>
<p>Joe Nieuwendyk and Lehtinen scored 30 seconds apart for Dallas in the first period after Todd Marchant's short-handed goal 3:16 into the game gave Edmonton a 1-0 lead.</p>
<p>Bob Bassen scored the other Dallas goal. Kelly Buchberger and Doug Weight scored game-tying goals for Edmonton</p>
<p>Andy Moog made 20 saves for his 62nd career playoff victory and third with Dallas.</p>
<p>In Ahaheim, in the first playoff game in the Mighty Ducks history, linemates Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya each scored twice leading the Ducks to a 4-2 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes. It was the opening game of the Western Conference quarterfinals.</p>
<p>Guy Hebert made 27 saves and Jari Kurri picked up a pair of assists for the Ducks, who host Game Two on Friday.</p>
