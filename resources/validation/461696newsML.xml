<p>Only two people know who will receive the coveted Oscars at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' glittering awards ceremony on Monday night -- and they aren't telling.</p>
<p>The names of the Oscar winners are among the world's best kept secrets, sealed in white envelopes to be opened at the very last moment before a global television audience of about one billion, with the words, &quot;And the award goes to ...&quot;</p>
<p>Until those words are uttered, the only people who know which stars, directors and films have won the movie industry's top accolades are accountant Frank Johnson of the Price Waterhouse accounting firm and his associate, Greg Garrison.</p>
<p>There may be leaks from the Pentagon, there may be leaks from the White House, but the secret of the Academy Award winners has never been leaked by Price Waterhouse in the 69-year history of the event.</p>
<p>The votes this year from the Academy's 5,000-plus members were tallied by eight accountants who finished their work on Friday. The deadline for the return of the ballots was Tuesday and the task of counting them began on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Johnson, the chief of Price Waterhouse's entertainment division, has devised a way of making sure that even the counters cannot know the final results.</p>
<p>&quot;We do it all in one large room, but we use all parts of the room so that no one can see what anybody else is doing. Greg and I give out the ballots in small groups to the counters, and they give their tallies to us, so only Greg and I summarize the tallies and know for sure who has won,&quot; Johnson told Reuters.</p>
<p>The two men then have to keep their secret for 72 hours, until the critical envelopes are opened.</p>
<p>Johnson is all too aware of the burden he carries, but he shrugs it off. &quot;This is my 21st year of doing it, so I suppose I'm used to it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>To ensure the results get to the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, where the awards are to be presented, without mishap, two sets of envelopes were prepared and locked in a vault at Price Waterhouse.</p>
<p>On Monday, Johnson and Garrison will leave their Century City office in separate cars and at different times, each carrying a set of envelopes, and drive to a rendezvous with an off-duty police officer who will then drive them in his private car to the Shrine Auditorium.</p>
<p>It is a deliberately low-key operation, said Johnson. There is no fanfare, no police escort with sirens and lights, not even locks on the briefcases containing the envelopes.</p>
<p>&quot;They are zippered briefcases, and they are zipped shut, and they are always in our possession, but that's all,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Johnson is proud of his company's perfect record. Only once in the 69-year history of the Academy have the results been leaked, and then it was not Price Waterhouse's fault, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the early days when we did the results we would give them to the Academy, and the Academy prepared a press release (in advance) so that after the show the results would be announced, and I think in 1939 the Los Angeles Times jumped the gun in their evening paper and published the results,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>After that Price Waterhouse and the Academy went to the envelope system, and security has never been breached since.</p>
<p>Johnson and Garrison are the two unassuming men in tuxedos who are introduced to the audience at the beginning of the awards ceremony.</p>
<p>While the Academy is by no means the largest of Price Waterhouse's customers, it is certainly the most famous, &quot;and makes us the best known firm of accountants,&quot; said Johnson.</p>
<p>In addition to the awards, Price Waterhouse also prepares tax returns and financial statements for the Academy.</p>
<p>The Academy pays Price Waterhouse about $30,000 annually for between 2,000 and 3,000 hours of work, a much lower rate than the $100 an hour the firm bills other clients.</p>
<p>But the publicity generated for the company by the awards is invaluable, Johnson said.</p>
<p>Other large accounting firms, mindful of that, have offered to do the ballot counting for free, while others have actually offered to pay the Academy for the privilege.</p>
<p>But the Academy has stuck with Price Waterhouse. &quot;We have not considered changing firms. Price Waterhouse has never dropped the ball. They have treated it with utmost seriousness,&quot; a spokesman for the Academy said.</p>
