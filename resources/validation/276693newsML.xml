<p>Marxist rebels released one sick hostage on Christmas Day from the besieged Japanese embassy residence, but 104 remaining hostages had to make do with turkey lunch and Catholic mass as the crisis entered its ninth day.</p>
<p>His head slumped to one side, Kenji Hirata, 34, a first secretary at the Japanese embassy in Lima, was pushed out of the residence by Red Cross workers in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>A police ambulance sped Hirata away to a nearby hospital, where he was put on an intravenous drip and treated for dehydration. The Red Cross said his condition was stable but relatives in Japan said they were worried about his health.</p>
<p>Hirata left the residence just after 5 p.m. local time (2200 GMT)  with Roman Catholic Bishop Jose Luis Cipriani -- the first visitor, apart from Red Cross workers, allowed into the residence since the siege began on Dec. 17.</p>
<p>Cipriani, known in Peru for his outspoken denunciations of guerrilla violence and human rights violations, spent seven hours inside celebrating a Christmas Day Mass for the captives. Radio reports said he also heard hostages' confessions.</p>
<p>In another sign of lower tensions on Christmas Day, President Alberto Fujimori's daughter Keiko climbed out of her bullet-proof Mercedes near the site and called for the release of the VIP prisoners before delivering a turkey lunch courtesy of the first family.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank-you brothers. Happy Christmas,&quot; the hostages replied minutes later in a handwritten sign held up to a residence window.</p>
<p>Immediately below the message, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels placed their flag showing the face of Tupac Amaru, an 18th century Indian revolutionary after whom the guerrillas named their movement.</p>
<p>As the siege entered its ninth day, there was no indication of a concession by the roughly 20 heavily armed MRTA rebels.</p>
<p>Rebel violence continued elsewhere in Peru when the much larger Shining Path guerrilla group murdered six men from the same family in the early hours of Wednesday, police said.</p>
<p>The killings in a northern province of Peru were probably not related to the siege as the two guerrilla groups follow different communist doctrines and do not operate together, officials said.</p>
<p>Red Cross officials described the captives' health as good and said the delivery of fresh water and new supplies of medicine eased the risk of new cases of the diarrhoea and eye infections that some hostages had last week.</p>
<p>The besieged residence even became a tourist attraction. Visitors, who included flight attendants, turned up to gawk at the hordes of news people and police at the scene. At least one prostitute and several hawkers worked the nearby streets.</p>
<p>Hirata's release brought to two the number of hostages set free in the last three days. The other freed captive was Uruguayan Ambassador Tabare Bocalandro, liberated on Tuesday after his government released two MRTA guerrillas from jail.</p>
<p>Furious at the apparent concession, the Peruvian government pulled out its top diplomat in Uruguay.</p>
<p>Fujimori has flatly rejected all the demands made by the guerrillas and has said they must release the captives and hand over their weapons.</p>
<p>The rebels have vowed not to surrender until the government releases more than 400 MRTA members from Peruvian jails. They also want an end to free-market economic policies and more state support for the country's impoverished majority.</p>
<p>Japanese media covering the crisis speculated that a behind-the-scenes deal might be worked out to allow the MRTA captors to fly to asylum in Cuba after releasing the hostages, but there has been no official word on this.</p>
<p>Japan has around 30 nationals inside the besieged residence, including Ambassador Morihisa Aoki, host of the ill-fated cocktail reception that was stormed by the MRTA rebels.</p>
<p>In a clear sign that Tokyo fears the siege could drag on, Foreign Ministry officials said Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto may have to cancel a five-nation southeast Asia tour scheduled to start Jan. 7.</p>
<p>Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi was due to arrive in Lima early on Thursday to intensify efforts to secure the release of his country's ambassador to Peru, Ahmad Mokhtar.</p>
<p>As speculation over possible government concessions in the crisis swirled around Lima, Congress President Victor Joy Way was quick to deny as totally false a news agency report that the government planned legislation to grant guerrillas an amnesty.</p>
