<p>Lithuania's state-run Agricultural Bank said on Monday that its net profit in April was 571,000 litas.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman for the bank, Imandra Daukshiene, also told Reuters that the bank's unaudited profit during the first four months of the year was 11.814 million litas.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot provide comparative firgures for the same period last year since international accounting standards were introduced in the bank from the second half of 1996,&quot; Daukshiene said.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Bank reported earlier that its profit in 1996 was 25.5 million litas and 11.243 million litas in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Daukshiene also said that the assets of the bank at the end of April rose slightly to 1.277 billion litas from 1.24 billion litas.</p>
<p>Daukshiene said that the loan portfolio of the bank dipped to 1.02 billion litas in April from 1.06 billion litas in March and 1.08 billion litas at the beginning of 1997.</p>
<p>The deposits in the bank also dropped to 708.97 million litas in April from 715.24 million litas at the end of March versus 728.57 million litas at the start of the year.</p>
<p>Daukshiene also said that the bank was targeting a 27 million litas profit for 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank has called a general shareholders' meeting for June 6 to decide on a share capital increase but the board has not came to an agreement on how much it would be,&quot; Daukshiene said.</p>
<p>The present share capital of the bank is 128 million litas.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Bank is one of two state-run banks slated for privatisation by the Lithuanian government.</p>
