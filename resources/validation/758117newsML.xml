<p>The Indian government has already completed nearly 60 percent of its targeted borrowing for the current fiscal year, giving banks ample scope to meet industry requirements later in the year, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The borrowing spree has also triggered speculation about whether the government plans to exceed its target this year.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not clear at the moment whether they want to borrow more than budgeted for,&quot; said Anindya, an economist at NatWest Markets in Bombay.</p>
<p>The government has so far raised 79.73 billion rupees through treasury bills and 236.86 billion rupees through other securities against its budgeted borrowings of 535.68 billion.</p>
<p>A further 50 billion rupees will be raised next Monday through an auction of four-year bonds.</p>
<p>Analysts said surplus bank liquidity has helped the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raise cheap funds for the government.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is finding it easy to raise funds now because of the easy liquidity,&quot; Chatterjee said. &quot;It is trying to raise as much as possible when conditions are favourable.&quot;</p>
<p>Latest RBI figures show total bank deposits at 5,214.42 billion rupees on July 4, 1997, an increase of 775.89 billion over the year-ago figure.</p>
<p>Bank advances, however, grew by only 243.68 billion rupees in the same period to 2,774.60 billion.</p>
<p>With limited avenues for deploying their funds, banks have made a beeline for government securities, pushing prices up.</p>
<p>&quot;Yields are currently at record lows after the government shifted to borrowing at market-related interest rates,&quot; said Aashish Pitale, debt research manager at ICICI Securities and Finance Company (I-Sec).</p>
<p>The benchmark 10-year long bond, issued earlier this year at 13.05 percent, was traded at a yield of 11.70-11.80 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>The government started borrowing at market-related rates of interest in the early 1990s as part of a process of financial sector reforms. Previously, it borrowed at pre-determined rates that were often artificially low, analysts said.</p>
<p>Pitale said the RBI was looking at two goals while trying to complete the government's borrowing programme.</p>
<p>&quot;On the one hand it is trying to drain excess liquidity from the market,&quot; he said. &quot;The central bank has to keep a wary eye on M3 (broad money supply) growth as this could fuel inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>Year-on-year growth in M3 was 16.8 percent for the fortnight ending June 20. The RBI has set a target of 15.0-15.5 percent for 1997/98 (April-March).</p>
<p>&quot;The other thing the RBI is concerned about is that industry should not be crowded out,&quot; Pitale said.</p>
<p>&quot;If demand for credit picks up in the second half of the year, as is widely expected, banks will be free to service industry's requirements,&quot; he said. &quot;Therefore the government will not compete with or crowd out the private sector.&quot;</p>
