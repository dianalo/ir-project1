<p>Following are some of the leading stories in the Swedish papers this morning. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>DAGENS NYHETER</p>
<p>- Companies such as fashion retail chain Hennes &amp; Mauritz are fleeing the new share tax by taking the company off the stock exchange's primary list. Taxation minister Thomas Ostros says he will not relieve companies of the new tax until state finances are in order.</p>
<p>- Since 1993 the number of homeless women in Stockholm rose 41 percent, but this figure only includes those who have been in contact with social authorities. A new count which will be ready this summer will take others into account.</p>
<p>- The evening newspaper Expressen is buying an evening newspaper in Swedish west coast city Gothenburg, called GT, for 100 million crowns. Thereby Marieberg, controlled by the Bonnier family, owns three of four of Sweden's evening newspapers.</p>
<p>SVENSKA DAGBLADET</p>
<p>- Stefan Persson, chief executive and main owner of Swedish fashion retailer Hennes &amp; Mauritz, will avoid paying 100 million crowns in wealth tax when transferring Hennes &amp; Mauritz shares from the Stockholm bourse's main A list to the smaller O list. If the shares had remained on the A list Persson's taxes would have exceeded his dividend income.</p>
<p>- Swedes fly more and more with foreign traffic increasing the most, up 11 percent in the first four months of the year compared to the corresponding period last year mostly due to more charter flights.</p>
<p>- Tabloid Expressen, held by Swedish media group Marieberg, bought Gothenborg tabloid Goteborgstidningen (GT) from the Hjorne family's newspaper company Stampen for 100 million crowns.</p>
<p>DAGENS INDUSTRI</p>
<p>- Shares in Swedish clothing retailer Hennes &amp; Mauritz plummeted 10 percent after the company said it was transfering its shares from the Stockholm Stock Exchange's primary A list to the stockmarket's smaller O list. A new wealth tax forces Swedes with wealth exceeding 900,000 crowns to pay 1.5 percent tax on 100 percent of the value of shares listed on the A list, up from 75 percent, while shares on the O list remain exempt from tax.</p>
<p>- Swedish truckmaker Scania plans to boost profitability and fight competition by cutting its purchasing costs by several hundred million crowns annually.</p>
<p>- Swedish vehicle makers Saab Automobile AB and AB Volvo both gained market share in Britain last month. New Volvo registrations rose 39 percent compared to the same 1996 period while for Saab they increased 31 percent.</p>
