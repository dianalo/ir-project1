<p>Nawaz Sharif's election landslide sets the stage for a strong Pakistani government, but possible protests by his beaten opponent Benazir Bhutto could cloud prospects for stability, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bhutto, taunted as a &quot;bad loser&quot; by a triumphant Sharif, weighed her options after voters delivered a crushing defeat to her 30-year-old Pakistan People's Party (PPP).</p>
<p>PPP sources said she might boycott national and provincial assemblies in protest at alleged rigging of Monday's polls -- though foreign election observers detected no major abuses.</p>
<p>Political analyst Shirin Mazari said a PPP boycott would make little difference given the PPP's dismal showing.</p>
<p>With 163 results declared for the 217-seat National Assembly (lower house), the PPP had won only 12 seats, mostly in its strongholds in Sindh province, against 118 for Sharif's PML.</p>
<p>The PPP held 86 seats in the dissolved National Assembly, while the PML had 72. Bhutto commanded a majority through alliances with smaller parties and independents.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if the PPP wants to act as a spoiler, it can't actually do so,&quot; Mazari said. &quot;If a party of such size boycotts parliament, it hardly questions the legitimacy of parliament.&quot;</p>
<p>Sharif's majority may insulate his government from possible protests by a wounded Bhutto, but he will have to tread carefully in his relations with President Farooq Leghari and Pakistan's powerful military establishment.</p>
<p>Pakistan has been under military rule for 24 of its 50 years of independence. The past four governments, including two led by Bhutto and one by Sharif, have been sacked by presidents using controversial powers to dissolve the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Leghari called the latest elections after firing Bhutto on November 5 on disputed charges of corruption and misrule.</p>
<p>PML secretary-general Sartaj Aziz said Pakistan must project a stable image and avoid a repeat of perennial power struggles between the president and the prime minister.</p>
<p>Asked about Leghari's creation last month of a Council for Defence and National Security he said the new parliament would see how it functioned before deciding on its future.</p>
<p>The council brings together senior ministers and top generals, and gives the military its first formal say in government affairs, albeit an advisory one.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there are a lot of legitimate functions that can be performed within the existing constitutional framework, in other words, without giving the president executive powers, which the constitution does not give,&quot; Aziz told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Before the election, Sharif's opponents accused him of striking a secret deal with Leghari under which the PML would be allowed to regain power as long as it accepted the &quot;advice&quot; of the security council. Both men deny any such accord.</p>
<p>Mazari said Sharif should start by using his parliamentary muscle to remove the president's powers to dismiss elected governments, and send the new security council packing.</p>
<p>&quot;His first priority must be to restore the supremacy of the parliament and to remove all the distortions in the parliament like the Eighth Amendment,&quot; she said. &quot;The balance must be tilted back with powers resting with the prime minister.&quot;</p>
<p>Mazari said an attack on the constitution's Eighth Amendment -- used by presidents to sack governments -- might put Sharif on a collision course with Leghari, but the future premier could draw on the popular support demonstrated in the elections.</p>
<p>&quot;It is like a half-way house. We say we are a parliamentary democracy, but in reality it has turned over power to the presidential system and we can't continue like this,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think the establishment will find it easy,&quot; Mazari said. &quot;They will have to resolve their own problems and take back seats because that's the way it should be in a democracy.&quot;</p>
