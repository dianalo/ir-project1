<p>A tough, new regulation proposed by New York regulators to protect consumers from deceptive life insurance sales practices won the backing of several U.S. trade groups on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a public hearing at the New York insurance department, life insurers and agents said the regulation will help protect consumers from high-pressure sales tactics without unfairly restricting the free market.  </p>
<p>In addition, they said they believed the regulation could serve as a model for the rest of the country as the industry faces up to consumers' complaints about the inappropriate replacement of their existing life insurance policies, commonly known as churning or twisting.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the thrust of the proposed regulation is right on the mark,&quot; National Benefit Life Insurance Co Chairman Tracy Beyer told the hearing.  </p>
<p>Groups expressing support for the proposed regulation included the Life Insurance Council of New York Inc, the American Council of Life Insurance and the New York State and National Associations of Life Underwriters.</p>
<p>Indeed, at the two-hour hearing, a life insurance agents group even suggested that the current proposal does not go far enough.</p>
<p>The proposed regulation would require insurers to provide prospective customers with additional information about transactions that would replace existing life insurance policies.  </p>
<p>Insurers also would be required to appoint a senior officer to ensure the company is in compliance with the regulation.</p>
<p>In addition, the regulation would provide customers with a cooling-off period that would require replacement policies to be refundable at the consumer's request within the greater of 30 days from delivery or 60 days from the completed application.  </p>
<p>But Nathan Perlmutter, speaking on behalf of the New York State and National Associations of Life Underwriters, told the insurance department the cooling off period should be no less than a full sixty days from the delivery of the replacement policy.</p>
<p>In addition, he said, any field compensation for the replacing policy should be witheld until the end off that period.</p>
<p>He said full compensation should not be curtailed for any lawful transaction and that compensation is not a primary motivating factor for replacements.  </p>
<p>&quot;However, it is our view that many consumerists and financial advice columnists have championed the concept that replacements are spurred primarily by compensation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Recognizing this, our association and its members are willling to take a pro-consumer stance by waiting 60 days for compensation in replacement transactions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe this to be a significant good-will stance for the buying public,&quot; Perlmutter said.</p>
<p>New York's move to strengthen its regulation comes after several high-profile cases in which consumers complained about sales practices at several major U.S. life insurers.</p>
<p>The latest involved  Prudential Insurance Co of America, which agreed in July to a $35 million fine as part of a settlement of allegations of improper sales practices.</p>
<p>Other companies involved in similar situations in recent years, included  Metropolitan Life Insurance Co and Allianz Life Insurance Co of North America, a unit of Allianz AG Holding.</p>
