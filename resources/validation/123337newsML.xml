<title>CHILE: Official faults contractor in El Abra accident.</title>
<headline>Official faults contractor in El Abra accident.</headline>

<p>A contractor hired by El Abra copper mine, owned by Cyprus Amax Minerals Co, used &quot;absolutely inadequate&quot; building procedures before an accident last week that killed four workers, Chile's top mining safety regulator said.</p>
<p>The head of mining regulatory agency Sernageomin, Ricardo Troncoso, who inspected the accident site last week, said he could not rule out the possibility of criminal responsibility in the accident at the mine and that investigations continued.  </p>
<p>&quot;In cases like this, there is the possibility of criminal responsibility, but the technical questions are my field, not the legal questions,&quot; Troncoso told a news conference.</p>
<p>Cyprus Amax spokesman Mike Rounds said he would have no comment on Troncoso's remarks until he had more information on them and until El Abra had completed its own investigation.</p>
<p>The accident occurred when a corrugated steel tunnel over a conveyor belt that carried copper ore to a crusher plant collapsed as workers loaded earth on top of it.  </p>
<p>&quot;The tunnel was obviously not suited to that. This was an absolutely inadequate procedure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The accident occurred as mining accident fatalities have risen sharply in Chile this year after declining steadily since 1991, Mining Minister Benjamin Teplizky said.</p>
<p>Fifty people have died in mining accidents so far this year, compared to 39 in all of 1995, he told the same news conference.</p>
<p>Of those 50, most occurred in large mines such as El Abra and at least 20 deaths involved personnel from contractor companies rather than the mines' own staff, said Troncoso.  </p>
<p>Troncoso said the contractor building the tunnel, Parina Limitada, was rushing to finish the project because other parts of the mine had already come into operation ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>&quot;There was clearly pressure to finish the job... The project was completed ahead of schedule, which put pressure on the contractor to finish,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earth-moving equipment including five tractors were standing on top of the tunnel when it gave way, swallowing them up along with the workers, said Troncoso.  </p>
