<headline>Mexico stocks end roller coaster day higher.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-06-26</dateline>

<p>Mexican stocks ended a roller-coaster session on Thursday higher as foreign investors hunted for cheap stocks, dealers said.</p>
<p>The IPC index of 37 leading shares ended up 67.16 points to 4,464.98. Volume was healthy at 120.10 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors have been buying, but the purchases are very selective,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Rumours, later denied, that Standard and Poors rating agency was set to upgrade its rating on Mexico's sovereign debt sent stocks quickly higher at midday.</p>
<p>Stocks pared their gains after the rating agency denied it was considering such a move.</p>
<p>&quot;After the S&amp;P business, prices came back down, but investors must have seen some attractive prices because buy orders hit the market soon after,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>Gainers beat decliners 75 to 21 on the broader market.</p>
<p>Bucking the market was mining company Grupo Mexico, down 1.95 pesos to 24.05 pesos in its L shares. U.S. mining giant Asarco Inc. said it sold 20 million L series shares as part of its buyback programme.</p>
<p>Market heavyweight Telmex L shares rose 32 centavos to 19.30 pesos.</p>
<p>Dealers said some investors appeared to be betting there would be no political or economic fallout from upcoming mid-term elections on July 6.</p>
