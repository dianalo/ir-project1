<p>A relentless attack by Finn Tommi Makinen all but wiped out Juha Kankkunen's lead on the second day of the 1,000 Lakes Rally, sixth round of the world championship, on Sunday.</p>
<p>Makinen set fastest times in the day's first six stages in his Mitsubishi to cut his compatriot's lead from 42 seconds to eight, despite nearly smashing the front of his car on a high-speed jump.</p>
<p>&quot;I can go a bit faster but it's too much of a risk,&quot; Makinen said.</p>
<p>Toyota driver Kankkunen was suffering from an upset stomach and was running first -- sweeping the surface free of gravel for his rivals just as Makinen did on Saturday.</p>
<p>A fierce battle developed for third place between Finns Marcus Gronholm and Jarmo Kytolehto and Subaru driver Kenneth Eriksson.</p>
<p>Eriksson had to call on a chiropractor after damaging his back on a flat-out jump.</p>
<p>&quot;It was hurting so badly for 200 metres that I thought I must stop. It was like a knife in the back,&quot; said the Swede.</p>
<p>Spain's double world champion Carlos Sainz climbed to seventh in his factory-entered Ford Escort when Finn Harri Rovanpera rolled his privately-entered version on stage 17.</p>
<p>An electronics problem cost Belgian Ford driver Bruno Thiry 11 minutes and 20 places while he fixed it.</p>
<p>The 1,452-km rally finishes on Monday.</p>
