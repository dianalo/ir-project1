<headline>Deutsche stays defiant amid attacks over steel bid.</headline>

<p>Deutsche Bank AG remained defiant on Wednesday after heavy public criticism of its role in the aborted takeover bid by Krupp AG for Thyssen AG, saying it saw no basis for the attacks and was only doing its job.</p>
<p>But it conceded that the affair highlighted the need for a rethink of Germany's system of corporate governance.</p>
<p>One day after 30,000 angry steelworkers invaded Frankfurt to demonstrate outside Deutsche's twin-towered headquarters, chief executive Hilmar Kopper denied the bank had jeopardised livelihoods for financial gain by backing Krupp's bid.</p>
<p>He also said the takeover had been made impossible by political intervention and that it remained to be seen whether Thyssen and its staff would be better off after the merger of its steel activities with Krupp now being discussed.</p>
<p>Deutsche's reputation as one of the world's leading investment banks would have been far more likely to be damaged had it let a foreign bank arrange the bid, Kopper told the bank's annual news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't think our image has been damaged, seen professionally,&quot; he said. &quot;On the contrary.&quot;</p>
<p>Separately, Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt said the role of the banks in the bid &quot;left a bitter aftertaste for many people&quot; and urged banks to exercise more self-control so as not to fan public fears that their power was unbridled.</p>
<p>Deutsche, Dresdner Bank AG and U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had advised Krupp, whose full name is Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp, in its bid for Thyssen and had agreed to finance the takeover.</p>
<p>Krupp called off the bid late on Monday after a storm of protests from unions and politicians against what they called &quot;Wild West&quot; tactics.</p>
<p>Krupp and Thyssen were on Wednesday said to be close to signing a memorandum of understanding on a steel merger which would involve 8,000 job losses but no forced layoffs.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't see that we made any negative contribution to labour policy, we weren't involved and that wasn't our task,&quot; Kopper said.</p>
<p>&quot;I repeat we do not conduct industrial policy. If we are asked to accompany an industrial policy developed by someone else we will look at it.&quot;</p>
<p>Deutsche came under particular attack because it has management board members on the supervisory boards of both Krupp and Thyssen, but never told Thyssen that it was supporting a takeover by a rival.</p>
<p>Deutsche management board member Ulrich Cartellieri, who sits on Thyssen's supervisory board, acknowledged it was getting harder for bankers to grapple with the conflicts of interest resulting from their many supervisory board mandates.</p>
<p>&quot;It is becoming ever more difficult to maintain these mandate relations and this is forcing us to rethink,&quot; Cartellieri said.</p>
<p>Kopper said bankers were in demand from companies which wanted qualified members on their supervisory boards. &quot;We're not scrambling to take the posts.&quot;</p>
<p>The affair has led to renewed calls for curbs on the power wielded by German banks through their large industrial shareholdings and their many supervisory board mandates.</p>
<p>But Kopper said Deutsche, whose stakes include Daimler-Benz AG and building group Philipp Holzmann AG, did not intend to sell its shareholdings as long as taxes remained as high as they are.</p>
<p>Rexrodt dismissed criticism from the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) that the federal government was delaying plans to introduce legislation that would curb the power that banks may wield over industry.</p>
<p>The draft bill, that has not yet been presented to parliament, however, would not have been able to block Krupp's unsolicited takeover bid for Thyssen, he added. REUTER DCC</p>
