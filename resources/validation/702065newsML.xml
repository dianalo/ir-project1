<title>USA: Washington Mutual, Great Western deal done.</title>
<headline>Washington Mutual, Great Western deal done.</headline>

<text>
<p>Washington Mutual Inc. said Wednesday it completed its hard-won merger with Great Western Financial Corp., creating the nation's largest savings institution, after a lengthy fight with rival bidder H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Under terms of the merger, Great Western shareholders will receive 0.9 share of Washington Mutual common stock for each share of Great Western common stock. Based on Tuesday's closing common stock price of $63.81, the share exchange is valued at about $8 billion, the company said.</p>
<p>Washington Mutual's stock fell 69 cents to $63.125 on Nasdaq shortly before midday.</p>
<p>The merger became effective Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Washington Mutual said it expects to post a net after-tax charge of about $318 million for transaction-related expenses, including a pre-tax addition of $100 million to Great Western's reserve for loan losses.</p>
<p>As part of the management transition, John Maher, Great Western's president, and the other members of the Great Western Executive Management Committee will leave the Chatsworth, Calif.-based company at the end of July.</p>
<p>Great Western said Maher declined to join the board of directors at this time due to other commitments.</p>
<p>As part of the merger, it said three Great Western outside board members will join the Washington Mutual board of directors immediately.</p>
<p>Ahmanson, the Irwindale, Calif.-based parent of Home Savings of America, launched its then $6.7 billion hostile bid for Great Western in February and spent the next three months bickering with Washington Mutual over who had the superior offer.</p>
<p>But Washington Mutual cited its record of more than 20 successful acquisitions in the past 10 years and said it could cut expenses and grow revenue at the same time.</p>
<p>Washington Mutual is now the 11th-largest banking company in the United States, based on year-end assets. As of March 31 the combined company would have had assets of $88.5 billion, deposits of $52.5 billion and served nearly four million households from more than 1,200 locations throughout the West and Florida.</p>
