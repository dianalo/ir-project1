<title>PHILIPPINES: Asian experts urge worldwide ban on landmines.</title>

<p>Asian military experts on Wednesday backed the adoption of an international ban on landmines -- the world's &quot;hidden killers&quot; -- and urged Asian nations to stop producing, stockpiling and exporting them.</p>
<p>In a declaration ending a three-day meeting in Manila, experts from 18 countries called on the Asian Development Bank and other institutions to help finance a massive operation to clear an estimated 100 million landmines planted in 64 countries.</p>
<p>It did not name the states that continue to produce the weapon but a conference official said China and Russia were among them.</p>
<p>Countries most affected by landmines included Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, the statement said.</p>
<p>Indiscriminate of time, place and target, they are the world's &quot;hidden killers,&quot; Peter Herby, legal adviser of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which organised the meeting, told the closing session.</p>
<p>Herby cited the case of a three-year-old Cambodian girl whom an ICRC worker found chained to a tree near her house and thought it was the most inhuman thing a mother could do to her child.</p>
<p>The worker realised later &quot;it was the most loving thing the mother could do for her&quot; because they lived next to a minefield.</p>
<p>The mother had gone out to look for firewood but stepped on a landmine and never returned, Herby said.</p>
<p>&quot;The global scourge of anti-personnel landmines is unacceptable and must be stopped,&quot; the declaration said. &quot;The appalling consequences of (their) use...have far outweighed their military utility.&quot;</p>
<p>The declaration called on all Asian states to take part in upcoming negotiations in Oslo aimed at concluding a treaty banning the weapon worldwide by December.</p>
