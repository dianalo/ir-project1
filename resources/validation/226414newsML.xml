<p>New ways of smuggling drugs are frustrating Interpol, the international police organisation which spends more than half its time and resources waging war on the illegal drugs trade and organised crime.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite some successful efforts by our member countries and unprecedented inter-governmental cooperation, the problem of drug trafficking continues to pose new and complicated challenges in several regions,&quot; said Raymond Kendall, Interpol secretary general.</p>
<p>Kendall, a former British police officer, told a recent anti-drugs conference in the Qatari capital Doha that the problem was changing dimension.</p>
<p>&quot;Interpol spends over 60 percent of its time and resources fighting drug trafficking and the rest is divided between combating international organised crime, terrorism, economic crime and trafficking in stolen vehicles, works of art, human beings, guns and other weapons and more recently, but to a limited extent, nuclear products,&quot; Kendall said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are living in a time when the trade in illegal drugs is estimated to be second only to the international arms trade, in financial terms, with annual turnover of $500 billion,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In 1995, law enforcement authorities throughout the world seized thousands of kilogrammes of heroin, cocaine, cannabis and psychotropic substances.</p>
<p>Yet the operations and methods of drug smuggling and dealing in drugs are becoming more determined, complex and sophisticated and the trafficking has defied all boundary lines, says an Interpol document.</p>
<p>Heroin abuse is becoming more widespread worldwide with the increased production of opium in source areas in Asia, and with transit routes from southeast Asia to North America and from southwest Asia through the Balkans to Europe.</p>
<p>Increased trafficking in cocaine is no longer linked solely to the multi-billion-dollar North American market or Colombian drug cartels. Sizeable quantities are being shipped to Europe and most other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Despite intensified drugs law enforcement activities, including eradication of cannabis cultivation, multi-tonne consignments of cannabis resin continue to be shipped from several countries in Asia, Africa and South America to the consumer markets in the Western hemisphere.</p>
<p>The illicit manufacture and abuse of psychotropic substances is also on the rise in most parts of the world. They include such substances as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and methamphetamine, with the latter also being produced in the more potent crystalline form known as &quot;ICE&quot;.</p>
<p>Amphetamine analogs referred to as designer drugs have become very popular among young people, particularly in Europe and the United States. A matter of concern with regard to psychotropic substances is that legally-produced material finds its way to the illicit drug markets.</p>
<p>Interpol views Afghanistan as the largest single producer country of illicit opiate drugs -- heroin, cocaine and morphine. Intelligence reports show that in 1996 Afghanistan harvested close to 4,500 tonnes of opium. Extensive illicit cultivation was carried out in Helmad, Nimroz, Nangahar, Kandahar and Badkhashan provinces.</p>
<p>Pakistan estimates its current annual opium production at around 120 tonnes. The government has taken steps to restrict cultivation in the North West Frontier Province bordering Afghanistan, but the remoteness of the mountainous area combined with manpower restraints make law enforcement difficult.</p>
<p>Other producing areas which worry Interpol authorities include Myanmar, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam in Southeast Asia, and Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia and Bolivia in Central America.</p>
