<title>AUSTRALIA: Sydney starts selling 2000 Olympics.</title>
<headline>Sydney starts selling 2000 Olympics.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-12-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>The selling of the Sydney 2000 Olympics began on Tuesday with the first official Games T-shirt hitting the stores on New Year's Eve with a price tag of A$150 (US$119).</p>
<p>In what will be a four-year promotional campaign to help fund the Summer Olympics, organisers will sell everything from T-shirts and babies' bibs to socks and pins, all embossed with the Sydney Olympics logo.</p>
<p>But while an embroidered collector's edition T-shirt is priced at A$150, other T-shirts will range from A$30 to A$50 and a baby's bib retails for A$13.</p>
<p>The marketing push begins officially on the first day of 1997, the start of the Sydney Olympic quadrennium when sponsors can promote their association with the 2000 Games.</p>
<p>Olympic organisers on Tuesday announced 17 major sponsors would contribute more than A$500 million in cash and services.</p>
<p>Organisers hope to raise A$2.4 billion in total sponsorship and sales, with television rights contributing A$1.2 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;We have achieved this in much less time than we thought,&quot; organising committee chief executive Mal Hemmerling said. &quot;Sydney sits better than any other Olympic Games in history.&quot;</p>
<p>Organisers hope to close their major sponsors programme by mid-1997 with about 22 companies, half the number in Atlanta, in line with a strategy to reduce sponsor numbers and boost value. Global giants to take out worldwide rights for the Sydney Olympics include traditional Olympic supporters such as Coca-Cola, McDonalds, IBM and Visa.</p>
<p>Fuji Xerox, United Parcel Service, Kodak, Panasonic and Time have also signed up, along with eight national partners which will have Australian sponsorship rights.</p>
<p>Organisers would not say what each company would be paying for the sponsorship deal, but said the minimum floor set by the organising committee was around A$25 million.</p>
