<p>Thailand wants assurances from Hong Kong's Hopewell Holdings Ltd that it will complete at least a portion of a delayed multi-level rail and highway system in Bangkok by late 1998, government officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The US$3.2 billion project, originally due to be completed by 1999, involves construction of 60 km (37.5 miles) of multi-level railways and highways to relieve traffic congestion in the capital.</p>
<p>Hopewell chairman Gordon Wu is scheduled to meet Transport and Communications Minister Suwat Liptapallop on Friday to discuss progress of the project.</p>
<p>A firm representing Hopewell in Bangkok said about 17 percent of the project's 40-km (25-mile) phase one structural and civil works and 44 percent of its piling works were finished in March.</p>
<p>Hopewell was holding talks with four new contractors to help speed up the project, it added.</p>
<p>A Hopewell official said on Thursday that about 30 percent of phase one construction on the Rangsit-Yomaraj-Huamark route in the project had been completed.</p>
<p>Alan Good of Thai Bauer, contracted by Hopewell to undertake most of the project's piling work, told Reuters his firm had driven about 7,500 of phase one's 15,000 piles.</p>
<p>&quot;We have basically completed over 50 percent of the piling works for the north and east routes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Government sources attributed the delay partly to Hopewell's problems in raising equity and construction financing.</p>
<p>Hopewell raised its project equity to 15 billion baht (US$517 million) from six billion baht during the first half of this year but the government in May asked it to double the figure by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Hopewell said in March it would need US$1 billion in equity funding and over US$2 billion in project financing for the project.</p>
<p>Thailand said in May it would fine Hopewell 7.5 million baht for each day of phase one's delay, for a maximum total of 134 days, if the company failed to complete it by November 1998.</p>
<p>Analysts estimated that Hopewell had spent over US$500 million on the project. The firm has a 30-year concession to operate the toll mass transit system after its completion.</p>
<p>The project includes a toll road, an elevated train system, and upgrading of part of the existing state railway network in Bangkok.</p>
