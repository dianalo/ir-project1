<p>Georges Marchais, veteran former leader of the French Communist Party, was taken to hospital on Wednesday suffering from a recurring heart ailment, a party spokesman said.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether his condition was serious. Marchais, 76, has suffered several heart attacks.</p>
<p>A Stalinist hardliner, he ran the Communist Party for more than two decades from 1972.</p>
<p>Under him the once-powerful French party was one of Moscow's staunchest allies in Western Europe. In 1979 he shocked the nation by giving full public backing to the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In 1993, dogged by ill-health, and shaken by the collapse of Soviet rule, he handed over the party reins to the more liberal Robert Hue.</p>
<p>Even after turning over the leadership, however, Marchais remained in the policy-making politburo and was widely seen as heading an old guard of hardliners resisting Hue's efforts to modernise and liberalise the movement.</p>
<p>Last week Marchais announced that he would not seek re-election to parliament at the next general election in 1998.</p>
