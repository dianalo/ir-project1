<p>Tennis star Steffi Graf's father was released on bail on Friday after a German court trying him on tax evasion charges ruled he no longer needed to remain in custody.</p>
<p>Graf slipped through the back door of the courtroom and left in a car after after paying five million marks ($3.3 million) in bail.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to be at home,&quot; Graf told journalists. When asked if he had telephoned his daughter Steffi who is playing in a tournament in Philadelphia, Graf shook his head.</p>
<p>He was not allowed to say any more as the case is still continuing.</p>
<p>The 58-year-old had endured an anxious day waiting to hear whether a higher court in Karlsruhe would overturn the lower court's decision to release him from 15 months of custody. Prosecutors had objected to the decision.</p>
<p>It is possible Graf may be taken back into custody if the Karlsruhe court upholds other objections from the prosecution.</p>
<p>The Mannheim court said Graf would have to report to police twice a week and receive pyschotherapy. His mental health during his time in custody has been the subject of German newspaper speculation.</p>
<p>After the decision he was seen smiling and shaking hands with friends in the courtroom which was surrounded by police. He paid his bail with a cheque.</p>
<p>Graf is accused of evading 19 million marks ($13 million) of tax on his daughter's earnings between 1989 and 1993.</p>
<p>Steffi Graf has said she knew little about her financial affairs, entrusting them to her father from the start of a career which has taken her to the number one spot in women's tennis.</p>
