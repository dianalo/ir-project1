<p>The Cyprus government on Tuesday strongly condemned a night of rioting in the capital Nicosia sparked by Greek Cypriots opposed to a United Nations-sponsored peace concert in the no-man's-land dividing the city.</p>
<p>The violence, among the worst to hit the usually quiet city in recent years, injured 54 in nearly three hours of clashes between youths and riot police on Monday night.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a sad discord by irresponsible troublemakers who committed unacceptable acts, including assaults and vandalism aimed at obstructing citizens of the republic in exercising their constitutional right to gather peacefully and declare their desire for the peaceful co-existence of Greek and Turkish Cypriots,&quot; said spokesman Manolis Christofides.</p>
<p>Twenty-three dishevelled youths appeared before local judges on Tuesday afternoon. The court ordered that 18 of them remain in custody pending investigations into unrest, assaults and causing malicious damage to property. Five others were released for lack of evidence along with 34 youths detained overnight but not charged.</p>
<p>The youngest of them, a boy of 15, looked ready to cry during the six-hour hearing, held in three separate courtrooms packed with relatives who frequently interrupted proceedings.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is going to feed my seven kids?&quot; shouted one woman, children in tow. Her husband was remanded for eight days.</p>
<p>Opposition by Greek Cypriot groups to the free concert -- for both Turkish and Greek Cypriots -- was underlined by another concert in the Greek Cypriot-populated half of the capital which attracted about 5,000 people -- some 2,000 more than the estimated audience at the peace concert a mile away.</p>
<p>The Greek Cypriot groups saw the U.N. concert as an attempt to peddle Turkish propaganda while disregarding the fact that Turkish forces still occupy the northern third of the island.</p>
<p>Turkey occupied northern Cyprus in 1974 in an invasion sparked by a brief Greek Cypriot coup engineered by the military then ruling Greece.</p>
<p>U.N. attempts to reunite the island under a federal umbrella have failed to yield results, but it is pushing for the resumption of peace talks between the two sides this summer.</p>
<p>The concert is one of several events planned by the U.N. to try to encourage grassroots contacts between the two sides which have been virtually non-existent since 1974.</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot wait until after a settlement for people to start getting together and to start showing some respect for each other,&quot; said Gustave Feissel, the U.N. Secretary-General's special representative on the island.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a substitute to working out a settlement but it is certainly an important element to help pursue it,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>On Monday night around 200 bare-chested youngsters waving blue-and-white Greek flags went on a rampage, smashing windows of police cars and throwing petrol bombs. Rubbish bins were set on fire and protesters lobbed stones at police who responded with teargas.</p>
<p>On the Turkish side, witnesses reported far-right Turkish &quot;Grey Wolf&quot; nationalists threw stones at a bus carrying a Turkish singer to join a Greek pop star at the peace concert. Windows were broken but there were no injuries, they said.</p>
<p>Ignoring the violence, pop stars Burak Kut of Turkey and Sakis Rouvas of Greece sang for the crowd of young people in the U.N.-controlled no-man's-land beside the Venetian walls that once protected the city.</p>
<p>Singing a mixture of Greek and Turkish songs, and several in English, the two singers drew cheers from the crowd as they hugged one another and shook hands at the end of the concert, which lasted about 90 minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;It went extremely well. What was striking was the total mixing. It was quite clear they all had a great time and got on very well,&quot; said Feissel.</p>
<p>&quot;The important message was the message which came from inside. That is the message that is relevant. The one that was going on outside -- that's not going to get us to a settlement, that's for sure.&quot;</p>
