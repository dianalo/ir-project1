<p>Belgian shoe distributor Brantano said on Wednesday its initial public offering on the Brussels bourse due next month would polish it for an expansion in Europe which could include acquisitions as well as new stores.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason for this event is of course growth...in Europe,&quot; chief executive Joris Brantegem told a news conference. He said a prospectus and details of the listing would be presented at a road show on May 28.</p>
<p>Bookbuilding for institutional investors starts on May 29. The book building period will be followed by a public offering of 40 percent of the equity.</p>
<p>Brantano, which has a workforce of 640 -- representing 558 full-time equivalents -- will enter foreign markets cautiously, Brantegem said.</p>
<p>&quot;Every market has its own habits, collections,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chairman Kurt Moons said the group, with 102 outlets in Belgium and three test shops in France, generated enough cash flow to carry out takeovers.</p>
<p>Brantano, which sold 3.3 million pairs of shoes in 1996, had a 1996 net current profit of 173 million francs ($4.9 million) and 324 million francs ($9.2 million) net cash flow.</p>
<p>Turnover rose to 3.375 billion francs ($95.8 million) in 1996 from 2.675 billion ($75.9 million) a year earlier. Own funds are 645 million francs ($(18.3 million) and capital excluding reserves 150 million ($4.3 million).</p>
<p>Its market share rose 70 percent over the past three years to about nine percent of the Belgian market which has itself shrunk to 38.6 billion francs from 42 billion francs two years ago. Retail shoe shops account for 52 percent of total sales, the larger chains for the rest, he said.</p>
<p>($ = 35.23 Belgian francs)</p>
