<p>That handbag is swinging again and the woman who wields one of the most potent symbols in British politics, Margaret Thatcher, has her other hand once more grasping the reins of power.</p>
<p>William Hague's election as leader of the Conservative Party is a triumph for Thatcher who ruled Britain with an iron fist for 11 years before being ousted in a party putsch in 1990.</p>
<p>Her party is now run by a right-winger who, due to his young age, will need advice and firm guidance from an experienced party elder. Guess who.</p>
<p>His views on ties with Europe -- thus far and no further -- mirror those of Thatcher who warmly supports Hague's opposition to Britain joining the single currency.</p>
<p>Perhaps sweetest of all, Hague's defeat of left-winger Kenneth Clarke at last gave Thatcher revenge on those she blamed for her shattering dismissal from Downing Street seven years ago.</p>
<p>Newspaper cartoonists and commentators were in no doubt on Friday who is now in charge.</p>
<p>Many played on the theme of Thatcher rising from the dead to anoint Hague. The right-wing Daily Telegraph showed the 36-year-old tucked up in his cot, watched over by Thatcher above the caption &quot;the hand that rocks the cradle&quot;.</p>
<p>Right-wing MPs believe it was Thatcher's decision to break her silence just 24 hours before the final round and back Hague publicly that ensured the result went his way. Hague polled 92 votes to Clarke's 70.</p>
<p>&quot;It was Margaret who swung it,&quot; said Sir Teddy Taylor. &quot;She made people come to their senses,&quot; said David Heathcoat-Amory.</p>
<p>Thatcher herself was happy to accept the accolades, joining Hague at a celebration party with her husband Denis and underlining that she felt Hague was &quot;her man&quot;.</p>
<p>Hague's first appointment, naming Thatcher's great friend and ally Lord Cecil Parkinson as the new party chairman, indicated he wanted to milk the experience of Thatcher's glory days of the 1980s.</p>
<p>But commentators said Thatcher's support could be a double-edged sword, as it would alienate many of those who supported Clarke.</p>
<p>&quot;Too many Tories -- Lady Thatcher herself is the most grotesque example -- still believe that a return to pure Thatcherism will be followed by a return to power,&quot; said a leader in the left-wing Guardian newspaper.</p>
<p>Hague has been a fervent disciple of Thatcherism, a philosophy embracing free markets and individualism, ever since he addressed Thatcher and 5,000 activists at the 1977 party conference as a bumptious 16-year-old.</p>
<p>He had just entered parliament when Thatcher was ousted by a party who believed she had lost touch and was an electoral liability. John Major was the Iron Lady's chosen successor but he quickly turned out to be a disappointment.</p>
<p>Thatcher actively plotted against Major as he tried to keep his party from splitting over the key question of closer ties with the European Union, and appeared to believe he lacked the necessary backbone to be a success.</p>
<p>She played her part in boosting Conservative morale during the election campaign and, after the party's crushing defeat, she said she believed Tony Blair's Labour Party endorsed many of the principles that had guided her.</p>
<p>Silent in the early stages of the campaign to elect Major's successor, Thatcher only joined the fray when Clarke united with arch right-winger John Redwood.</p>
<p>This unholy alliance proved too much for her to swallow and raised the awful prospect of Clarke winning control of the party and ending her influence once and for all.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Hague) stands for the things I believe in -- above all, he offers a clear vision of Britain as a free, sovereign nation with control over its own affairs,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>There is little love between Clarke and Thatcher, dating back to the hours leading up to her ousting in 1990 when the rumbustious Clarke, then her health minister, told her she should go.</p>
<p>&quot;His manner was robust in the brutalist style he has cultivated -- the candid friend,&quot; she noted acidly in her memoirs.</p>
<p>To add to Thatcher's feeling of a job well done, Clarke's main cheerleader was Michael Heseltine, deputy prime minister under Major and the man whose challenge to Thatcher in 1990 led to her downfall.</p>
<p>Heseltine's all-consuming ambition to become prime minister has been thwarted once and for all by Hague's election. Altogether a very satisfying day's work, Thatcher must be thinking.</p>
