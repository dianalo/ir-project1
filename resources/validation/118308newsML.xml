<p>Two German machinery firms entered states of emergency on Monday when toolmaker Traub AG began a last-ditch push to avert collapse and East German machinery group SKET looked set for liquidation.</p>
<p>After crisis talks with its banking partners on Monday, cash-strapped Traub declared itself insolvent and announced plans to start so-called composition proceedings -- the German legal system's last defence against bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Traub is one of the medium-sized firms -- known as 'Mittelstand' -- which form the backbone of Germany's economy.</p>
<p>SKET looked even closer to disaster after its supervisory board moved controversially to start liquidating the company, saying workers had forced them to take the step by refusing to accept radical restructuring and job-shedding plans.</p>
<p>The crises form part of a broader picture of woe for German industry, where company insolvencies are expected to rise another 15 percent this year, almost three times faster than the European average.</p>
<p>The most spectacular crisis to date involved the now defunct shipbuilder Bremer Vulkan AG, which went though a composition process before conceding defeat in May.</p>
<p>Market rumours that Traub would be the next to go have been circulating for weeks and intensified when its stock was removed from trading on Monday and Tuesday at the request of Deutsche Bank AG, which leads its group of bankers.</p>
<p>In the red for years, Traub has had a particularly disastrous 1996, posting a loss of 16.4 million marks on six-month sales of 223.9 million, and its banks have so far refused to sanction the group's bid for a capital increase.</p>
<p>Around 1,100 of Traub's 2,300 staff already agreed last March to accept an eight percent wage cut for five months.</p>
<p>The company will now attempt to work out a solution to its debt crisis with its banks and try to persuade investors and workers to support its efforts to survive. During that process, it plans to maintain all its activities as normal.</p>
<p>&quot;The goal of the process is to return Traub to lasting profit as soon as possible,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>However analysts said the company, whose stock has plummeted this year from a 1996 high of 145 to 33 marks at the close of trade last Friday, remained on extremely shaky ground.</p>
<p>&quot;First the banks have to approve a new concept for the company which is by no means certain. We are keeping this stock on underweight and will keep it there until things are clearer,&quot; said DB Research analyst Guenther Dielmann.</p>
<p>A Traub spokesman told Reuters the group was intensifying its search for an investor to support its plans for a capital increase. At present, the company is 27-percent-owned by its founding Traub-van-Kempen family.</p>
<p>The spokesman also said Traub was confident of the backing of its banking associates. &quot;That has always been the case and that was the case yesterday as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However DB Research's Dielmann warned that, even if Traub were to find an international partner, a capital reduction could not be ruled out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the East German BVS agency, the successor to the Treuhand privatisation agency, said it was prepared to provide additional funds to prevent the collapse of SKET, former East Germany's biggest machinery firm, even after the start of the liquidation process.</p>
<p>Sources said the European Commission was also assessing the situation at SKET and that officials were trying to find ways to ensure some that at least some of its subsidiaries survive.</p>
<p>SKET workers, who had rejected management plans to slash the workforce to 570 from 1,850, called on German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to intervene to stop the liquidation process. Kohl had urged workers on Monday not to let SKET go under.</p>
