<p>Coconut oil prices are expected to continue staggering this week, weighed down by the steep fall in soyoil in Chicago and prospects of rising copra and alternative vegetable oil supplies in the region, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;But don't expect active trade this week. The market will not be playing with a full deck of cards due to a vegetable oil convention in Budapest,&quot; said a senior trader.</p>
<p>Traders said coconut oil prices may slide further by $5 to $10 per tonne this week before it stages a technical rally.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect a sell-off due to the CBOT soyoil news, reports of rising palm production in Kuala Lumpur and coconut oil exports from both the Philippines and Indonesia,&quot; said a foreign dealer in a large commodity house.</p>
<p>&quot;But a rebound is imminent as export values of coconut oil have dropped between $60 and $70 per tonne for the last 30 days,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>Coconut oil last traded at $655 per tonne for June/July shipment in Rotterdam on Monday, another trader said.</p>
<p>Coconut oil stocks increased to 20,100 tonnes in Rotterdam as of May 12 compared to 17,429 the previous week.</p>
<p>Domestic copra prices also dropped to nine pesos per kg from 10.50 the previous week. Crude coconut oil dipped to 16 pesos per kg from last week's 17.30 due to prospects of better Philippine cocout harvests in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Philippine coconut products exports in the first four months of the year fell 18 percent to 451,828 tonnes, according to a preliminary report by the United Coconut Association of the Philippines. The country exported a total of 552,239 tonnes of coconut products in January to April 1996.</p>
<p>Preliminary data also showed coconut oil exports in the first four months of the year fell 20 percent to 251,604 tonnes against 314,897 in the same period last year.</p>
<p>But traders expect better export numbers in the second half of the year which historically accounts for 60 percent of the Philippine coconut harvests for the year.</p>
<p>Coconut Oil Refiners Association president Jesus Arranza said recently he expected coconut oil exports to rise to between 1.2 and 1.3 million tonnes this year from 813,157 in 1996.</p>
