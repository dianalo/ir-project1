<p>Police in southern China have smashed two gangs trafficking in women and children, arresting a total of 33 suspects and rescuing 17 boys and seven women, state media said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Police arrested 27 people for kidnapping 31 boys around Liuzhou city in the southern province of Guangxi over the past two years, the China Business Times said.</p>
<p>The kidnappers tempted the children with food and toys and sold them for up to 12,000 yuan ($1,440) each in the neighbouring and wealthier province of Guangdong where families pay high sums for a coveted son.</p>
<p>Authorities returned 17 of the children, aged between three and 12, to Liuzhou last week where most were reunited with their families, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Four of the boys -- kidnapped for between four months and two years -- had not yet been claimed by their relatives.</p>
<p>Police were still searching for 14 boys, it said.</p>
<p>Police arrested six men in the southern coastal town of Shantou last month for kidnapping and selling 16 women and rescuing seven of their victims, the China news service said.</p>
<p>The women, who came from other provinces to work in the coastal boomtown, were lured by offers to go out singing or for a late night snack, it said.</p>
<p>It gave no details of the nine women still missing.</p>
<p>China has long fought to end trafficking in women and children, but the ancient trade continues in many rural areas, fuelled by a shortage of eligible women and the strong desire among many farmers for a son.</p>
<p>The trade in children is exacerbated by China's strict one couple, one child family planning policy that is raising the ratio of men to women.</p>
<p>Rural families have been known to abort or kill female offspring to make sure they have a son.</p>
