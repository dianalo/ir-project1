<p>Nasionale Pers said on Thursday it had finalised the sale of its entire stake in Sunday newspaper City Press to newly established group City Press Media (Pty) Ltd, of which Naspers owns 49 percent, for 110 million rand.</p>
<p>Aimed at the black market, City Press is South Africa's third largest circulation English language newspaper.</p>
<p>Naspers chairman Ton Vosloo said in a statement that City Press Media would be 49 percent owned by his group with three black groups holding 40 percent, distributors six percent and staff five percent.</p>
<p>The anchor partner in the black consortium, with 20 percent of the shares, was Dynamo, which is headed by the Inkatha Freedom Party's former secretary general, Oscar Dhlomo.</p>
<p>The two other black groups, which would each hold 10 percent, were New Seasons, led by former KaNgwane chief minister Enos Mabuza and Cape-based investment group Ukhosi, which is run by Lizo Ngcokoto.</p>
<p>A further six percent of the company would be made available to City Press distributors while five percent would be offered to the newspaper's staff.</p>
<p>Vosloo said the deal would be financed through a 100 million rand loan from Absa Bank and shareholders' loans of 10 million rand. Absa will hold the title as security for the loan, for which Naspers is standing surety.</p>
<p>&quot;Five-year cash projections indicate that the company will have no difficulty in meeting its repayment obligations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The deal would in no way hamper editorial independence and through a management contract, Naspers would control printing and distribution. This was because the paper's present profitability was based on the cost benefits derived from the economies of scale of Naspers' printing and distribution infrastructure.</p>
<p>Vosloo said that Naspers had been planning to draw black investors into City Press since it had bought the newspaper in 1984.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe City Press, which currently enjoys a readership of 1.5 million, has the potential to become the first newspaper in South Africa to sell more than a million copies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;However, growth is currently being hampered by a lack of printing capacity and plans are underway to increase existing capacty through extensive investment in newplant.&quot;</p>
