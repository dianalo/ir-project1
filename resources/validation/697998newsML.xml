<headline>Judge hears arguments in new Wilner smoking case.</headline>
<dateline>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. 1997-07-01</dateline>

<p>A Jacksonville judge heard arguments for and against punitive damages Tuesday in another tobacco case involving R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp, and anti-smoking attorney Norwood &quot;Woody&quot; Wilner.</p>
<p>In a three-hour pre-trial hearing in judge's chambers at state court in Jacksonville, Circuit Judge Michael Weatherby heard Wilner argue that he should be allowed to seek punitive damages on behalf of his client Joann Karbiwnyk, who says her smoking of Reynolds' Winston and Salem brands caused her to develop lung cancer diagnosed in 1995.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Reynolds said Florida law should not permit that.</p>
<p>Karbiwnyk, 58, started smoking in the 1950s when at high school and quit in 1984.</p>
<p>Weatherby had ruled last week he would not postpone the case, set for trial Aug 4. However Ted Grossman, an attorney for Reynolds, made a renewed plea for a delay till October, saying there were only 20 business days until trial and Reynolds was not ready.</p>
<p>Wilner, saying he is involved in another trial set for November, accused the tobacco firm's lawyers of stalling.</p>
<p>The judge was expected to rule on both issues soon, possibly as early as Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wilner last summer won a watershed $750,000 judgment for his clients, ex-smoker Grady Carter and his wife, Millie, against defendant Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., a unit of Britain's B.A.T Industries Plc. The B.A.T unit has appealed.</p>
<p>He then lost a subsequent case earlier this year in which he had represented the estate of dead smoker Jean Connor, who smoked Reynolds' Salem cigarettes. A jury cleared Reynolds of responsibility in her death.</p>
