<headline>Senate &quot;partial birth&quot; ban not &quot;veto-proof&quot;.</headline>

<p>The Senate backed a controversial proposal on Tuesday to ban so-called &quot;partial birth&quot; abortions, but the White House immediately vowed to veto it.</p>
<p>The vote was 64-36, three short of the 67 needed to override a veto. The House of Representatives in March passed the ban by a large margin that appears veto-proof.</p>
<p>Senate sponsors immediately urged Clinton to reconsider his veto threat, and said they would keep pushing hard for the few additional needed to override a veto.</p>
<p>&quot;My intention is to override the veto. I think it's what the American public wants. It's what decency demands,&quot; said Sen. Rick Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican who has led the fight to outlaw a procedure he said &quot;borders on infanticide.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton vetoed the ban last year and has pledged to do so again now, saying it does not make exceptions to protect the health of a pregnant woman. The Santorum bill only allows the procedure to save a woman's life.</p>
<p>&quot;The president will veto it,&quot; White House spokeswoman Mary Ellen Glynn said. &quot;All he wanted was a narrow exception to protect women from serious health consequences.&quot;</p>
<p>Since Clinton took office in 1993, Congress has overridden only one of his vetoes, on a securities fraud bill in 1995.</p>
<p>Partial birth, also known as intact dilation and extraction, involves the partial extraction of the foetus feet-first, the subsequent suctioning out of the foetal brain and the removal of the foetus.</p>
<p>Should the ban be enacted, it would be the first federal restriction on an abortion procedure since the 1973 Supreme Court Roe versus Wade decision upholding abortion rights.</p>
<p>A ban would probably face a court challenge, because critics say its restrictions on second trimester abortions may be incompatible with Roe versus Wade, and its lack of health exemptions may violate related Supreme Court decisions.</p>
<p>&quot;By making no exceptions for maternal heath and inadequate exceptions to save a woman's life, this bill flies in the face of well-established Supreme Court precedents,&quot; Catherine Weiss of the American Civil Liberties Union said.</p>
<p>Buoyed by a last-minute endorsement by the American Medical Association, Santorum scrambled to pick up votes and did win over some Democrats who generally back abortion rights, including Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.</p>
<p>Daschle said the decision to support the measure was made even more difficult by his failure last week to win backing for an alternative approach that would have banned all abortions, by this or other procedure, after a foetus is viable and able to survive outside the womb.</p>
<p>Unlike Santorum's bill, Daschle's bill would not have banned &quot;partial birth&quot; earlier in pregnancy and it had health exceptions.</p>
<p>Explaining his vote, Daschle vigorously criticised Roman Catholic officials in his home state who, he said, had initially encouraged his efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;Their harsh rhetoric and vitriolic characterisations, usually more identified with the radical right than with thoughtful religious leadership, proved to be a consequential impediment to the decision I have made today. It was most destructive,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Although the Senate has been debating the ban on and off since last week, only two Democrats, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, both of California, took the floor on Tuesday to argue against it.</p>
<p>Lott and other Republicans said their priority for the next few months is to override the veto but that Daschle's failed amendment of last week might eventually be the basis for a future attempt to find common ground.</p>
<p>But Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee, said that Daschle's bill was &quot;just for show&quot; and would not stop a single abortion.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a damage control effort for Daschle and Clinton and we don't want any part of it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Daschle lashed out at critics who accused him of foisting a sham on the Congress and said, &quot;Our nation must find a solution to this deeply vexing moral problem that has persisted and divided us. Let us not give up hope.&quot;</p>
