<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT and KCBT wheat futures were volatile in late dealings with profit taking pounding the market as of 1230 CDT, but prices remained buoyant and showed signs of recovering within 10 minutes of the market break, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was small lot selling and a lack of buying and locals were also pressing the issue,&quot; a KCBT trader said referring to a 22 cent per bushel break from the day's highs in the May contract.</p>
<p>Chicago May had moved in a 14-1/2 cent range as of 1243 CDT.  </p>
<p>Wheat futures were boosted to contract highs in the deferred months in early dealings. Traders said the late volatility was due to profit taking and cited no change in fundamental input.</p>
<p>Support remained in the market on flooding in U.S. spring wheat growing areas, a recent freeze in the U.S. Great Plains hard red winter wheat region and on dry weather in portions of European wheat growing areas.</p>
<p>As of 1248 CDT, CBOT wheat was 1/2 to 4-1/2 cents per bushel higher, with May up 2-1/2. KCBT wheat was two to 2-1/2 cents per bushel higher with May up 2-1/2 at $5.01-1/2.</p>
