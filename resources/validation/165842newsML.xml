<p>North Sea physical crude values continued to struggle on Tuesday with no sign of any imminent recovery in differentials.</p>
<p>Dealers said a number of unsold mid-to-late November cargoes and an impossible arbitrage to U.S. buyers had kept the pressure Dated Brent in particular.</p>
<p>Two sales, Nov 13-15 at Dec -45 cents and Nov 11-13 at Dec -48 cts, valued the North Sea marker down on Monday sales.</p>
<p>Some dealers saw an element of CFD-related trading in the two deals but most agreed the market looked weak enough to sustain the numbers done.</p>
<p>Norwegian Gullfaks C, however, was able to command an unchanged premium of 24 cents over Brent for a Nov 21-23 loader.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we going to see differentials for November cargoes get much better, but then again they probably won't get much worse either,&quot; said a North Sea seller.</p>
<p>West African spot markets weakened as an overhang of late November cargoes began to drag on first decade December values despite renewed interest from Far East refiners, traders said.</p>
<p>At least three Angolan Cabindas were sold late last week or on Monday to Chinese buyers and a distressed Nov 12-13 Qua Iboe moved to Indonesia around Dated Brent +47/+48 cents, they said.</p>
<p>But other Far East interest was concentrated in the second decade of December, leaving remaining November and early December barrels struggling.</p>
<p>Traders said another Qua Iboe was still unsold in November, along with two or three Escravos and a third decade Brass River.</p>
<p>Mediterranean Urals was looking firmer after trade last week cleared a prompt overhang.</p>
<p>Offers were coming from Dated Brent -95 cents cif Med compared with a deal at -$1.02 on Friday.</p>
