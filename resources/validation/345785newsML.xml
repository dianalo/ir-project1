<title>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: Ireland's unions vote to accept new wage deal.</title>

<p>Ireland's trade union movement voted on Thursday to accept the latest national wage agreement, a key element in Ireland's economic success in recent years.</p>
<p>Delegates at a special conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), the umbrella body representing all of Ireland's unions, voted by a margin of 83 votes to accept the new agreement, known as Partnership 2000.</p>
<p>There were 217 votes for the agreement and 134 against.</p>
<p>A consensus approach by government, employers and unions to the management of the economy, known as social partership, has been a cornerstone of Irish economic success in recent years.</p>
<p>This approach, which includes centralised pay agreements, has kept a lid on wage inflation and industrial unrest, allowing Ireland to enjoy the fastest-growing economy in the European Union while maintaining a comfortably low inflation rate.</p>
<p>Union ratification of Partnership 2000, the fourth agreement of its kind, was widely expected after a ballot by Ireland's largest union, SIPTU, approved it on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Irish employers have also endorsed the deal.</p>
<p>The Irish Business and Employers' Confederation (IBEC), which represents 5,000 employers, approved the agreement on Wednesday, saying it gave reasonable pay increases while protecting the competitiveness of industry.</p>
<p>Partnership 2000 allows for wage rises of 9.25 percent over a three-year period and promises tax reductions of 1.0 billion punts ($1.6 billion) over the life of the accord.</p>
<p>The programme also sets targets for the public finances, aiming for a general government deficit of not more than 1.5 percent of GDP and a debt/GDP ratio of 70 percent by 1999.</p>
<p>Analysts had been concerned that if the agreement were rejected, it could put upward pressure on Irish inflation.</p>
<p>Acceptance of the new deal effectively caps wage inflation at 2.5 percent this year and serves to limit upward pressure on consumer price inflation, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The agreement on Partnership 2000 means that the kind of social and economic solidarity, which has been one of the linchpins of our recent economic success, is maintained,&quot; the Irish Times said in its Thursday editorial.</p>
<p>The alternative - a return to free collective bargaining with...&quot;leapfrogging claims&quot; as various groups of workers press competing demands - is almost unthinkable.&quot; ($1=.6257 Punt)</p>
