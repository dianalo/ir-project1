<p>Entertainer Bill Cosby was expected to testify on Tuesday in the trial of a woman charged with trying to extort $40 million from him in return for not telling a newspaper that she is his illegitimate daughter.</p>
<p>People started lining up outside the U.S. District Court in Manhattan at 6 a.m. EDT (1100 GMT) for the 25 to 30 seats available to the general public for Cosby's appearance.</p>
<p>Cosby has admitted to having had an affair with the mother of 22-year-old Autumn Jackson, but denied being Jackson's father. Paternity is not an issue in the trial.</p>
<p>Tape recordings played at the trial on Monday revealed that Cosby's attorney Jack Schmitt agreed to pay Jackson $24 million not to tell a supermarket tabloid newspaper that she was his illegitimate daughter.</p>
<p>Jackson was arrested in January. She and her alleged accomplices, Jose Medina, 51, and Boris Sabas, were charged with conspiracy, extortion and engaging in interstate commerce to commit crimes.</p>
<p>If convicted they could face prison terms of 12 years and fines of $750,000.</p>
<p>When the trial began last week, the government introduced a Jan. 16 letter Jackson wrote to former CBS President Peter Lund.</p>
<p>In the letter Jackson said she wanted to speak to Lund and Cosby about her &quot;undeserved and impoverished financial and living conditions&quot; or she would expose the entertainer in a move that could hurt the ratings of his current CBS television programme.</p>
<p>She said if Lund and Cosby could not help her, she would sell her story to the Globe supermarket tabloid. She enclosed a contract with the Globe for $25,000.</p>
