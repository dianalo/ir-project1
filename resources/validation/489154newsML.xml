<headline>UK's Major blames IRA as Grand National cancelled.</headline>

<p>The Grand National steeplechase, one of Britain's great sporting events, was abandoned on Saturday because of a bomb alert blamed by Prime Minister John Major on the Irish Republican Army (IRA).</p>
<p>The Aintree race course near the northwestern English port city of Liverpool was evacuated about 30 minutes before the 3:45 p.m. (1445 GMT) scheduled start of the four-and-a-half mile (7.2 km) steeplechase after police said they received two coded warnings of bombs at the sprawling track.</p>
<p>Security sources believe the IRA guerrillas, who want an end to British rule of Northern Ireland, are trying to force Northern Ireland on to the political agenda of the British May 1 election campaign, where it has received scant attention.</p>
<p>Major, speaking outside his Downing Street office, condemned the IRA for wrecking the race and said they could not now &quot;suddenly and cynically&quot; declare a ceasefire and expect their political representatives to be admitted to peace talks on Northern Ireland in the near future.</p>
<p>There has been no claim of responsibility for the bomb alert that forced the cancellation of the 150th running of the Grand National and the evacuation of 60,000 racegoers, but Major said he had no doubt the IRA was to blame.</p>
<p>Major said it was quite possible that the IRA, which planted bombs on British motorway bridges on Thursday, would think it could now suddenly resume the ceasefire it abandoned in February 1996 and expect its political representatives to join peace talks on Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I hope they realise that they may think that way but the British government doesn't and the British people doesn't.&quot;</p>
<p>Britain has said it will not admit Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to the Northern Ireland peace talks unless the IRA declares a lasting ceasefire.</p>
<p>Officials at Aintree said decision would be taken on Sunday on when to re-run the race. Police said it was too early to say whether the race could be run on Monday.</p>
<p>Police said crowds outside the course would not be allowed in on Saturday to retrieve cars inside the perimeter, a decision that would trap thousands in the area for the night. Local authorities were opening sports halls to accommodate them.</p>
<p>Security forces carried out two controlled explosions at the race course after finding several suspect packages following the evacuation and said more of the controlled blasts were likely.</p>
<p>Bomb warnings, also believed to be the work of the IRA, disrupted rail and underground services in London on Friday at the height of the evening rush-hour.</p>
<p>Opposition Labour Party leader Tony Blair, whose party is well ahead of Major's Conservatives in public opinion polls, said a &quot;contemptible&quot; campaign by the IRA had wrecked the race.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been deliberately ruined by a cynical terrorist act, perpetrated by people whose intention is to introduce terror into the election campaign,&quot; Blair said.</p>
<p>Aintree spokesman Nigel Payne told reporters on Saturday; &quot;The police have received two coded bomb warnings, and they felt it was the most appropriate thing to evacuate the entire racecourse. From our point of view the safety of spectators is the most paramount thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Jockey Carl Llewellyn, due to ride Camelot King in the big race, described the situation as sick. &quot;Whoever did this are not sportsmen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>About 100 horses were believed to have been left in their stables when racegoers and officials were evacuated.</p>
<p>IRA strategy for years has been to attack the British mainland to force British public opinion to put pressure on government to find a solution to the 28-year Northern Ireland conflict, which has cost billions and 3,200 lives.</p>
