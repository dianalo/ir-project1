<p>The European Union (EU) is expected to award as much as 50,000 tonnes of current series white sugar at its weekly tender later on Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>A range of 30,000 to 50,000 tonnes was suggested for this week's award, compared with 24,000 tonnes last week.</p>
<p>But with the current series approaching its close it was difficult to gauge the level of trade interest remaining to apply for licences, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody really knows -- I would imagine if anyone has got any business to do they'll come out and do it this week,&quot; said one trader, citing a favourable dollar rate.</p>
<p>&quot;But we are getting towards the end of it...it might be very little.&quot;</p>
<p>The maximum restitution level was forecast at 39.475 Ecus per 100 kilos, based on a notional MATIF August/October differential of 0.631 Ecus, which is applied as a discount to a straight October calculation.</p>
<p>Last week the EU awarded a maximum 40.850 Ecus.</p>
<p>Traders said the 1996/97 export series was still lagging in its cumulative tonnage awards and was expected to turn out a shortfall of up to 150,000 tonnes on the balance sheet figure of 2.84 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The last tender for the current season will be held on July 30 and the first tender of the new season on August 6.</p>
