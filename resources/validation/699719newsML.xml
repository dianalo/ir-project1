<headline>C&amp;W's Optus price seen as full but justified.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Cable and Wireless Plc is paying a full price for effective control of Australia's second telecoms operator Optus Communications, but most analysts said on Tuesday it was justified.</p>
<p>&quot;On our estimates, it will be earnings dilutive to 1-2p in year one for C&amp;W, neutral in year two neutral then earnings enhancing,&quot; said Andrew Moffat, telecoms analyst at brokers SocGen.</p>
<p>&quot;Its an incredibly good deal for them,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers, said that with Australian analysts estimating Optus's value at between A$3.5-4.5 billion, C&amp;W was paying a price at the top end of the acceptable range.</p>
<p>But Harrington believes that ownership of assets is key as international telecoms companies jostle for prime positions to offer communications services to high margin multi-national corporate customers.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's a great deal for Cable and Wireless. It really does enhance C&amp;W as a strategic asset owner. It will now control two of the three most important Asia-Pacific telecoms hubs -- Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia -- once this deal goes ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;They paid a full price but a price that I believe is justified,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Although C&amp;W has no controlling asset in Singapore, it is part of the MobileOne consortium which bidding for a fixed licence to enhance its mobile interests.</p>
<p>Despite a population of just three million, Singapore is one of Asia's biggest financial markets and the regional base for thousands of multi-national firms, generating huge demand for communications.</p>
<p>Harrington says telephone usage per line in Australia is also higher than average.</p>
<p>Few analysts believe the Australian government will baulk at relaxing a 49 percent limit on foreign companies' stakes in Australian firms and agreed that C&amp;W was probably pretty confident of winning approval.</p>
<p>C&amp;W's most lucrative asset has long been a majority stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. C&amp;W said last month it would sell down its shareholding to around 30 percent to China if &quot;important projects&quot; on the mainland are realised and if a deal is earnings enhancing.</p>
<p>The group's shares were trading 4.5p higher at 557p by 1200 GMT, down 0.5p from before the Optus announcement. But, market makers said few sellers were around and the price seemed firm in slim trade ahead of Wednesday's Budget.</p>
