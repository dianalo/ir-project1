<p>British Prime Minister John Major must call a general election by May 22, 1997. Following is a run-down on the mechanics of the election.</p>
<p>The election cut-off date is set as the first Thursday that follows the fifth anniversary of the opening of parliament after the 1992 election plus 17 days, not including weekends and bank holidays.</p>
<p>The 1992 election was held on April 9 and parliament opened on April 27.</p>
<p>Elections are normally held on a Thursday but the prime minister is free on paper to choose a different day.  </p>
<p>Major said earlier this month that the election would be no later than May 1, the date of local elections.</p>

<p>After informing the monarch, prime minister announces to the House of Commons the dissolution of parliament, the date of the election and explains the reasons for holding the election.</p>
<p>Polling takes place within 17 days of the dissolution, not including weekends, bank holidays and &quot;days of public thanksgiving or mourning&quot;. If the monarch dies after the dissolution, polling day is postponed for two weeks.</p>
<p>- - - - Eligible to vote are 43.9 million out of 58 million inhabitants. The voting age is 18. Voting is not compulsory. In 1992, 77.8 percent of the electorate of 43.2 million voted.</p>

<p>Willam Hill bookmakers quote the following odds on the month in which the election will be held: May 4-7, April 11-8, March 12-1, November 14-1, December and February 25-1, January 50-1.</p>
