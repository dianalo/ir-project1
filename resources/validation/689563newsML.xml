<p>Implied volatilities for dollar/yen options spiked up in U.S. trading as the spot greenback slid on a newswire report that suggested the Bank of Japan wants to raise interest rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone seems to be anticipating a stronger yen,&quot; said Masao Okada, chief options dealer at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York. &quot;We're not seeing such a huge move in spot yet, but volatilities are getting really sensitive.&quot;</p>
<p>One-month dollar/yen volatility shot up to 11.7/12.0 percent toward midday, with the 12.0 offer hit several times, as the dollar fell toward 113 yen on the report.  </p>
<p>The one-month had been trading at around 11.0 percent earlier in the day, down from mid-11 levels late on Wednesday, as spot drifted in the upper 113-yen area for most of the day.</p>
<p>The Market News Service report said the BOJ was getting nervous about leaving its discount rate at a record low 0.5 percent but was holding back because of the negative effect on economic growth of a recent rise in the nation's sales tax.</p>
<p>A European bank trader in Chicago said the market's nervousness over a renewed dollar slide was evident in the persistent sharp skew for yen calls in risk reversals, the cost of swapping equally out-of-the-money puts and calls.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, dollar/mark volatilities were little changed across the curve as the dollar continued churning in the upper 1.72-mark area.</p>
<p>One-month dollar/mark volatility stood at 8.3/8.5 percent, marginally below late Wednesday levels. The volatility curve maintained a slightly positive slope, with one-year pegged at 9.05/9.15 percent.</p>
<p>One-month 25-delta risk reversal stood at around par after being slightly bid for mark calls earlier.</p>
<p>-- Chicago Derivatives Desk ((312-408-8750))</p>
<p>E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com  </p>
<p>&quot;It's pretty clear where people see the risk is,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One-month 25-delta was assessed at about 2.5/3.0 points in favor of yen calls, against late Wednesday's 2.3/2.8 and the widest known trade of around 2.65 earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Okada said the skew was much steeper than that seen when the dollar was tumbling below 100 yen a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>He added that an avalanche of yen call buying by end-users recently had made bank dealers collectively short in downside strikes, forcing them to run for cover when spot fell.</p>
<p>Back end volatilities were slightly less buoyant, with one-year dollar/yen up a quarter point to 10.8/11.1 percent.</p>
