<title>USA: Crude oil soars within a breath of post Gulf War high.</title>
<headline>Crude oil soars within a breath of post Gulf War high.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Crude oil prices on Monday rose within a breath of their post-Gulf War highs during a day of unexpectedly wild trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange, traders said.</p>
<p>News of production problems over the weekend at a BP America refinery in Toledo, Ohio, heated the market up late Monday morning, forcing sceptics to reconsider their positions.</p>
<p>&quot;That was the straw that broke the camel's back,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, a trader with Prudential Securities in New York, referring to the BP story. &quot;This is very much a bullish market,&quot; Barakat said.</p>
<p>Crude futures for November delivery on the NYMEX settled 96 cents higher at $25.62 a barrel after hitting a contract high of $25.68 -- a touch shy of the $25.70 post Gulf War high set this past spring -- earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Traders said the writing on the wall was in London, where crude futures for November delivery on the International Petroleum Exchange Monday set a post-Gulf War high at $24.80 a barrel or 88 cents higher than Friday's settlement.</p>
<p>Much of the market's strength on both sides of the Atlantic continued to be linked to tight supplies of distillates such as diesel or heating oil, traders said.</p>
<p>Heating oil led the upward NYMEX charge on Monday, with the contract for November delivery gaining 2.64 cents and settling at 74.07 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>Traders looked forward to the American Petroleum Institute's (API) weekly inventory report, due late Tuesday, for a fresh view of just how tight heating oil stocks are.</p>
<p>&quot;If we don't get a build in heating oil stocks of two to three million barrels, this market could go to 80 cents a gallon,&quot; said Tom Bentz, analyst with ING Derivatives Clearing in New York.</p>
<p>Heating oil stocks on the East Coast, the largest heating oil market in the world, are now at 24.5 million barrels, or 40 percent below year-ago levels.</p>
<p>Gasoline for November delivery settled 2.18 cents higher at 67.70 cents a gallon -- just a touch shy of a contract high of 67.80 cents set during the session.</p>
<p>Other markets, however, were in a less bullish mood and the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities fell by 0.21 points to 245.49.</p>
<p>Soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade fell to a 10-month low as the prospects for this year's U.S. crop continued to improved amid almost ideal harvest weather.</p>
<p>The market was already on the defensive following Friday's government U.S. production estimate of 2.35 billion bushels, which would be the second largest soybean crop ever. Soybeans fell the 30-cent daily trading limit on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;There was spillover from the crop report and the good harvest weather weighed on it,&quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>The fall sparked talk that China may pull out of recent purchases to take advantage of cheaper price levels.</p>
<p>Last week the USDA reported China purchased 50,000 tonnes of U.S. soymeal and 55,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans in the week ended October 3 and traders expected more sales to be reported when data for the following week is issued on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are big fears China may cancel their bean or meal purchases,&quot; one CBOT soybean trader said.</p>
<p>November soybeans closed 11-3/4 cents a bushel lower at $6.88-1/2 after earlier dipping to a low of $6.82.</p>
<p>Corn futures also dipped to a 10-month low early on follow-through selling after a bearish U.S. government report Friday which put U.S. production at 9.01 billion bushels, which would represent the third largest crop ever.</p>
<p>The market then recoverd, boosted partly by sentiment the fall had been overdone with commercials featured buyers.</p>
<p>December corn closed 2-3/4 cents higher at $2.86-1/2 after falling early to a low of $2.82-1/4.</p>
