<headline>Amazon.com shares surge after IPO.</headline>
<dateline>SEATTLE 1997-05-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of money-losing Amazon.com Inc. surged on their first day of trading Thursday as investors bet the online retailer has an early lead in the growing business of selling books over the Internet.</p>
<p>Amazon.com stock rose as high as $30 in early trading on Nasdaq, $12 above the price of $18 set on Wednesday in its $54 million initial public offering (IPO).</p>
<p>Though it remains unprofitable, Amazon.com has been one of the more successful ventures to set up shop on the Internet. The two-year-old company, a mail-order operation based in Seattle, publishes a catalogue of several million book titles on the Internet and online services.</p>
<p>The company lost about $3 million in the first quarter, but sales are growing quickly. First quarter revenues of $16 million alone outstripped its $15.7 million in sales for all of 1996.</p>
<p>Investors were betting the company's well-known name among Net users will give it an edge over brick-and-mortar booksellers, such as Barnes &amp; Noble Inc., that are just wading into the online world.</p>
<p>&quot;It has great revenue growth and a great name,&quot; said Kathleen Smith, portfolio manager at Renaissance Capital, an investment firm specialising in initial stock offerings.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors seem to feel that the story is strong enough that they can wait for earnings.&quot;</p>
<p>The Amazon.com offering is the second high-profile IPO in the high-technology arena this week. The stock of Rambus Inc., a computer chip designer whose investors include Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates, more than doubled to close at $30.25 in their first day of trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Amazon.com's offering also resembles that of another Internet pioneer, Netscape Communications Corp., which used its well-known Navigator browser software to get an early lead over Microsoft and other competitors. Netscape's stock more than doubled on its first day of trading in August 1995, as investors bet a famous brand would fuel sales growth.</p>
<p>Amazon.com has attracted considerable attention this year because it is one of only a handful of companies to successfully exploit the Internet as a place to do business.</p>
<p>The company offers more than 2.5 million titles and bills itself as the world's biggest bookstore. On Monday, Barnes &amp; Noble Inc. took issue with that description and filed a lawsuit against Amazon.com.</p>
<p>Barnes &amp; Noble also launched its own Web site on Tuesday, boasting it had more than 1 million available books, most of which were being offered at prices that undercut Amazon.com's.</p>
<p>While sales have grown quickly, Amazon itself warned that the rapid growth was straining the computers that track its business. In the offering prospectus, it also said it expected &quot;substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future.&quot;</p>
<p>The Amazon.com offering has helped make founder Jeff Bezos a wealthy man. The company on Wednesday sold 3 million shares at $18 apiece in its $54 million IPO.</p>
