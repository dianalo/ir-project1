<p>Economic analysts said on Monday that the finance minister's latest projection for slower Thai economic growth was more realistic than previous forecasts.</p>
<p>Minister Bodi Chunnanada told reporters late on Sunday that Thailand's economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), could be below the government's target of 7.8 percent. Last year's growth rate was 8.6 percent.</p>
<p>He said he was optimistic that GDP growth for Thailand, hit this year by an economic slowdown and sluggish exports, could reach at least 7.0 percent, though there was a possibility the rate could fall below that level.</p>
<p>Thai Bankers Association President Olarn Chaipravat recently forecast that 1996 GDP growth may be 6.8 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;If the export figures for June and July that we received were correct, it is possible that the GDP growth this year would be as Olarn forecast,&quot; said Bodi.</p>
<p>Analysts said many researchers had already revised their growth forecasts down in light of slow exports. Peregrine Fixed Income Ltd, for example, expects the formerly robust Thai economy to slow to 6.2 percent growth in 1996.</p>
<p>Thailand's economy has grown at an average of 9.8 percent since 1987, but exports growth for the first seven months of 1996 was only 3.8 percent, compared with a 26.2 percent rise in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Thailand's private investment and industrial production indices have also slackened, according to official data.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a good sign though that the government is finally becoming more realistic than hopeful,&quot; said Song Seng Wun, regional economist of HG Asia in Singapore.</p>
<p>Kanchit Assavasamrarn, an economist with Vickers Ballas, said Bodi's projection was more in line with what most economists anticipated.</p>
<p>&quot;The 7.8 percent GDP growth target is too high for the current export growth,&quot; said Khanchit.</p>
<p>He said Vickers Ballas had revised its forecast for 1996 growth to 7.1 percent. Less optimistic Song saw GDP growth for Thailand this year at 6.5 percent to 6.6 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;If Thailand does not shift further and faster into value-added types of exports and still focuses on labour-intensive industry, the country will continue to be subjected to the cyclical nature of the industry,&quot; Song said, adding that other countries with cheaper labour forces would catch up soon.</p>
<p>Separately, the Bank of Thailand's Governor Rerngchai Marakanonda told reporters late on Sunday that the baht, which had been under pressure, had normalised.</p>
<p>Offshore investors sold the baht heavily in periods from July through early September on devaluation rumours.</p>
