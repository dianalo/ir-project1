<p>Wilson HTM Ltd said Novus Petroleum Ltd was being recommended as a buy investment after highlighting the long term potential of the company's increasing gas reserves.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth in Asian gas consumption combined with Novus' growing gas reserves forms the basis for strong long-term growth potential,&quot; research director Phil Hutchings said in a report.</p>
<p>The probability of further exploration success in 1997 also underpinned the buy recommendation, Hutchings said.  </p>
<p>The bulk of the growth in reserves was now coming from gas, including the booking of gas reserves in the Kakap block ahead of development of the West Natuna gas gathering system supplying gas to Singapore from the year 2000, Hutchings said.</p>
<p>Recently potentially successful wells including Singa One in Indonesia and Miriwah One in Pakistan, also highlighted the growth evolving from Novus' Asian gas strategy, he said.</p>
<p>The company's existing oil production provided the cash flow from which to grow the Asian gas business, Hutchings said.</p>
<p>Wilson made no profit forecasts for Novus in the current year ended December 31, 1997.  </p>
<p>Novus reported a net profit for its 1996 financial year of A$19.51 million compared with $13.13 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>At the time of Wilson's report the Novus share price was at $4.50, compared with A$4.39 on Tuesday afternoon, which was 16 cents below Monday's close.</p>
