<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan president plans Southeast Asia visit - report.</title>
<headline>Taiwan president plans Southeast Asia visit - report.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1996-12-20</dateline>

<p>Taiwan is arranging a secret diplomatic mission for President Lee Teng-hui to Southeast Asian countries, a trip that will surely draw strong opposition from rival Beijing, the United Daily News said on Friday.</p>
<p>The mass circulation newspaper, quoting unspecified sources, said some Southeast Asian nations had agreed to host Lee but demanded his visit be kept secret.</p>
<p>The possible hosts are the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>All four nations have formal ties with China.</p>
<p>Taiwan officials were in talks with other nations in the region to allow the president to visit more places, the paper said.</p>
<p>Lee's presidential office declined to comment.</p>
<p>A furious Beijing suspended semi-official Taipei-Beijing talks and staged war games and missile tests near Taiwan after Lee made a private, but high-profile visit to the United States in June 1995.</p>
<p>Communist China, Taiwan's arch rival since a civil war split them in 1949, regards the island as a rebel province ineligible for foreign ties. It has tightened a diplomatic squeeze on Taipei in its quest to bring Taiwan under mainland rule.</p>
<p>To evade rival China's diplomatic embargo, Taiwan officials have engaged in &quot;secret diplomacy&quot; -- unannounced visits to countries which recognise Beijing instead of Taipei.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister John Chang dropped out of sight on Tuesday and surfaced in the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, both allies of China.</p>
<p>China said on Thursday it strongly opposed Chang's visit to Jordan and accused Taipei of trying to disrupt Beijing's ties with its allies.</p>
<p>Chang and Vice-President Lien Chan have followed a similar pattern for numerous overseas trips in the past year, disappearing for days at a time as international and Taiwan media scurried to track them down.</p>
<p>Lien made such a secret visit to Ukraine in August, triggering a minor row between Kiev and Beijing. Chang angered China with visits to Singapore and Malaysia in September.</p>
<p>Chang again disappeared after his December visit to South Africa, where he had sought in vain to reverse Pretoria's November 27 decision to switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Chang surfaced in Belgium on December 7 but failed to win access to Belgian leaders and other officials there as Beijing diplomats mounted what Taiwanese officials said was a concerted drive to prevent such encounters.</p>
<p>Beijing refuses to form ties with any country that recognises Taiwan's exiled Republic of China government, but has stepped up efforts to win over South Africa and the 29 other states that still do.</p>
