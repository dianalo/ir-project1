<p>U.S. Corrections Corp, the Kentucky company that won Georgia's first contracts for private prisons, has withdrawn from the deal, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said Thursday.</p>
<p>The employee-owned company said it had miscalculated the cost of building and operating two medium-security prisons by $5.3 million a year.</p>
<p>U.S. Corrections was awarded the bid on April 22, beating out five competitors. It offered to build 500-bed prisons in Coffee and Wheeler counties in southeast Georgia for $13.43 million a year.</p>
<p>Georgia Department of Corrections officials had calculated it would cost the state $19.76 million.</p>
<p>U.S. Corrections officials said their price for the job would have been closer to $18.73 million. They said the company assumed a two-tier pricing system with a higher per-inmate cost for the first 400 prisoners and a lower rate for the next 100.</p>
<p>&quot;The state, however, accepted a price for the last 100 inmates as the cost for all inmates,&quot; U.S. Corrections spokesman Raoul Cunningham told the Journal-Constitution.</p>
<p>The company returned the $4 million that the state paid it when the contract was signed, and reimbursed Georgia for the $200,000 it spent evaluating the prison proposals. It also said it would not bid on any Georgia projects for two years.</p>
<p>In a letter to Corrections Commissioner Wayne Garner, company President Robert McQueen said the decision to pull out was difficult and &quot;most embarrassing.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokesman for Gov. Zell Miller, who has pushed for privatization of state agencies, said the state would probably reopen the bidding process.</p>
