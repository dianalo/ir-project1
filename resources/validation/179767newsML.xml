<title>SOUTH AFRICA: South Africa begins new era of labour law.</title>
<headline>South Africa begins new era of labour law.</headline>

<p>The sometimes troubled relationship between South Africa's workers and bosses entered a new era on Monday as the country's new Labour Relations Act (LRA) became official.</p>
<p>The LRA replaces apartheid-era legislation and for the first time, all sectors of South Africa's economy are governed by a single law.</p>
<p>Big business and labour unions welcomed the act, the first legislation to be processed by the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac).</p>
<p>&quot;After many years, months, weeks and hours of waiting, the LRA is finally about to become part of our daily lives. The apartheid LRA is no more,&quot; South Africa's largest labour federation Cosatu said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) said the new laws on union rights, bargaining councils, regulation of dismissals and strike legislation would improve the lot of South African workers.</p>
<p>Raymond Parsons, director general of the South African Chamber of Business (Sacob), said the act was the result of a series of compromises and would enable workers and management to forge mutually-beneficial agreements.</p>
<p>Parsons said the LRA would be judged over the next five years on its success in calming South Africa's tempestuous and often violent labour disputes.</p>
<p>Its contribution to the country's economic development would also be monitored, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The LRA must make collective bargaining a positive force for grappling with these issues in a flexible and effective manner,&quot; Parsons said.</p>
<p>Parsons said the act was not &quot;cast in concrete&quot; and may have to adapt to every day usage.</p>
<p>&quot;This approach must be welcomed as it could very well prove necessary to amend the act,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Both Cosatu, which is in formal alliance with the ruling African National Congress government (ANC), and Sacob called for more education among workers to make the act work.</p>
<p>&quot;Good legislation is as good as non-existent if the people it intends to help are ignorant and don't know its provisions,&quot; Cosatu said.</p>
<p>Sacob's Parson echoed the trade union federation's sentiments and said all workers, union officials and management should familiarise themselves with the new laws.</p>
<p>&quot;Crucial to the successful implementation of the LRA is the process of educating its users,&quot; he said.</p>
