<p>A host of rumours about Swiss pharmaceutical group Roche triggered a steep rise in its shares, helping the blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) reach new highs above 4,100 points, dealers said.</p>
<p>Roche certificates soared 765 francs, or nearly seven percent, to 11,935 in heavy volume after temporarily rising to an all-time high at 12,500.</p>
<p>Dealers cited rumours Roche might merge with foreign drug companies or dispose of its fragrances business. A Roche spokesman declined to comment on market rumours.</p>
<p>The SMI closed 92.3 points, or 2.29 percent, higher at 4,115.4 and the all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) surged 57.14 points, or 2.21 percent, to 2,638.73.</p>
<p>Volumes were relatively high, with a total of more than 3.9 billion francs traded on the exchange. Daily volume usually ranges between 1.5 billion and two billion francs.</p>
<p>Roche was also buoyed by high demand from derivatives- related transactions, one trader noted.</p>
<p>Other pharmaceuticals and chemicals such as Novartis, Clariant and EMS, also posted gains. Novartis registered shares edged up 24 francs at 1,570.</p>
<p>Sulzer, which was a winner on Tuesday after announcing plans to float 25 percent of its Sulzer Medica unit, gave up four francs to close at 978 after profit taking.</p>
<p>One dealer said Sulzer's decision sparked hopes for other spin-offs. This led to rises in potential spin-off candidates such as Oerlikon-Buehrle, Swissair and Alusuisse. Swissair gained 56 francs, or 4.7 percent, to 1,251.</p>
<p>Among the banks, UBS bearer shares fell three francs to 1,152.</p>
