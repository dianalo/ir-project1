<p>Turkey's parliament on Tuesday began to debate alleged ties between the powerful state security apparatus and organised crime following a car crash that killed a top police official and a gangster.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us begin discussions about the proposal for a parliamentary investigation into the activities of illegal crime groups and their relations with the state,&quot; deputy speaker Yasin Hatipoglu told parliament.</p>
<p>Former interior minister Mehmet Agar resigned on Friday after the crash, in which a mobster wanted for political killings and drug dealing died in the same car as a senior security official and a former beauty queen.</p>
<p>A Kurdish warlord, with close ties to the government, was injured in the crash. Associates say he is suffering from &quot;amnesia&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;If there had not been that crash, maybe we would not be discussing this subject in the parliament assembly today, despite several similar motions already pending,&quot; Justice Minister Sevket Kazan said.</p>
<p>At the start of the parliamentary session, Hatipoglu said President Suleyman Demirel had approved the appointment of Meral Aksener as Agar's successor. She is Turkey's first woman interior minister.</p>
<p>&quot;She has taken over the post at a really critical time,&quot; Hatipoglu said. &quot;She has taken on a very difficult task at a time when there are many unpleasant smells around.&quot;</p>
<p>When she took over from Agar on Monday, Aksener vowed to fight organised crime and the ministry said in a statement that it was considering instituting its own inquiry into the affair.</p>
<p>The chief prosecutor at Istanbul state security court on Tuesday opened an investigation into the crash.</p>
<p>The debate will be followed by a vote on holding a full-scale investigation.</p>
<p>But political analysts were sceptical the debate and the flurry of inquiries would produce anything more than the lip service paid to the subject from time to time.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not expect anything to come out of this debate because all those who are represented in parliament today have been in charge of running the country at one point or other in the past decade and thus have a share in the mess,&quot; wrote Ilnur Cevik in the English-language Turkish Daily News.</p>
<p>&quot;There are too many people in high places who are in this right up to their necks,&quot; Cevik wrote in his editorial.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and his deputy Tansu Ciller had denied any link between the crash and the resignation. But Agar said he resigned to clear the way for a parliamentary investigation.</p>
<p>Media reports say Agar stayed in the same hotel as the crash victims in the Aegean resort of Kusadasi shortly before the accident.</p>
<p>A deputy from Ciller's True Path Party (DYP), Sedat Bucak, was also in the car when it crashed in the western town of Susurluk. He was seriously injured and is being treated in an Istanbul hospital, where members of the well-armed Kurdish tribe which he heads were guarding him.</p>
