<p>German shares were off to a strong start on Friday, fuelled by overnight Wall Street gains and volatile dealings tied to the &quot;triple witching&quot; expiry of DAX futures, DAX options and stock options.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX was up 43.00 points at 3,7921.27 points, or a rise of 1.15 percent, as the index closed in on 3,800 points in relatively active dealings.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like today is going to be rather volatile but in the end we should see modest gains for the day,&quot; said one head trader at a Stuttgart-based bank. &quot;There's no real end in sight to this rally.&quot;  </p>
<p>The firmer dollar also underpinned market sentiment along with modest gains in German debt futures, which briefly fell in morning trade after German M3 money supply rose an annualised 7.0 percent in May, above market expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;The market right now is more focussed on the U.S. right now instead of on domestic factors,&quot; said one trader in noting the market's lack of enthusiasm for the money supply data, a key Bundesbank policy indicator.</p>
<p>Dealers instead focused on the expiry of DAX futures and options, with some traders saying the current outlook is for gains at the end of the session.  </p>
<p>The DAX futures contract ended trade on Thursday at 3,777.0 points and the opening price of the 30 shares in the index will be used to compute the contract's final price.</p>
<p>The final price for the DAX options will be set based on the average price for the DAX index in the last 10 minutes of bourse dealings from 1120 GMT to 1230 GMT.</p>
<p>Away from the expiry, traders said the dollar stabilising above 1.70 marks was a major factor for the advance based on views that dollar-sensitive shares would benefit, in turn helping the export-led German recovery.  </p>
<p>Vereinsbank said in a report the dollar could keep moving toward 1.80 marks in the near-term. The dollar was trading at 1.7260 marks in morning European dealings.</p>
<p>Among specific shares, retailer Karstadt AG rose ahead of the market, climbing 14.50 marks to 640 marks after falling on Thursday when WCM said it was not interested in buying a stake in Karstadt.</p>
<p>Against the trend were carmaker BMW AG, which fell about 1.70 percent to 421 marks, and construction group Hochtief AG that was down 1.60 marks at 83.20 marks.</p>
