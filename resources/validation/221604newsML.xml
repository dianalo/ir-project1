<p>Jakarta shares closed lower on Wednesday on profit-taking as announcement of a rise in Telkom's nine-month net profit failed to boost sentiment, brokers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was likely to stay weak on Thursday as profit-taking was likely to continue in some big-capitalised stocks and the focus was seen remaining on newly-listed BNI.</p>
<p>The Jakarta composite index fell 5.96 points, or 0.95 percent, to end at 620.27 points. Decliners led advancers by 57 to 51 and 74 issues were unchanged.  </p>
<p>Brokers said Telkom's nine-month results failed to have much impact as it closed 25 rupiah lower at 3,925 rupiah.</p>
<p>&quot;The announcement failed to have much impact as the results were within expectations,&quot; one foreign broker said.</p>
<p>Telkom said it posted a net profit of 1.13 trillion rupiah in the first nine months of 1996 against 878.4 billion rupiah in the same period last year.</p>
<p>BNI was the most active, with some 6.3 million shares changing hands. It ended 25 rupiah higher at 1,175 rupiah.  </p>
<p>Brokers said other big-capitalised stocks Barito Pacific, Sampoerna, Semen Gresik, Indosat, Astra and Bimantara were among the losers due to profit-taking.</p>
<p>Second-liner general trading firm Aneka Kimia was among the most active on talk of a possible acquisition, one broker said. Company officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Another broker, however, said Aneka's rise was due to an expected strengthening of its fundamentals.</p>
<p>Aneka rose 100 rupiah to close at 1,450 rupiah, with around 4.7 million shares changing hands.</p>
