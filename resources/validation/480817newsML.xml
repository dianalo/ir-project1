<p>A host of sporting celebrities came to Hungary on Tuesday to pay tribute to arguably the world's best known Hungarian soccer player, Ferenc Puskas, who celebrated his 70th birthday.</p>
<p>Among guests at a ceremony during which he received Hungary's presidential gold medal were International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch, former Real Madrid players Alfred di Stefano and Francisco Gento and Fritz Walter, captain of the 1954 German World Cup winning team who defeated Puskas's &quot;Mighty Magyars&quot;.</p>
<p>Puskas has a unique place in soccer folklore as the only man to play in what were probably two of the best remembered games in history, Hungary's stunning 6-3 victory over England at Wembley in 1953 -- the first time England had lost at home -- and Real Madrid's 7-3 slaughter of Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1960 European Cup final.</p>
<p>&quot;I came because I like the man, he's very special,&quot; Samaranch said before awarding Puskas the IOC's highest honour, the Olympic Order. &quot;As a Spaniard I thought he was one of the best ever players in that great Real Madrid team.&quot;</p>
<p>Former English Football Association president Sir Bert Millichip went further. &quot;In England they look upon him as the greatest footballer they have ever seen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But it was left to Di Stefano, with whom Puskas linked up at Real Madrid to form what was then the greatest midfield pairing in the world, to reflect on what made Puskas the game's most prolific scorer with 83 goals in 84 internationals for Hungary.</p>
<p>&quot;He had everything, he could pass, he was clever, took up wonderful positions and he was so elegant you would believe he was wearing gloves on his feet,&quot; he said. &quot;People thought the Real Madrid pitch had a slope to the left so much of the ball went to him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing you could predict about him was which foot he would use to shoot,&quot; quipped Gento, referring to the legendary left foot, which was responsible for most of his 800 or so goals in his professional career.</p>
<p>The same foot was in action again on Wednesday as he hitched up his trousers over the famous paunch and kicked off a friendly match between Hungary and Terry Venables' Australia in the same Peoples' Stadium he graced over 40 years ago.</p>
<p>For Puskas, though, the passage of time has not change his essential approach to life. &quot;Nothing's really changed all along. I help my friends, I work for my profession and I try and earn a living.&quot; he said after receiving his award.</p>
