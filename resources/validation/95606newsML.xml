<headline>BASEBALL-U.S. JUDGE ORDERS UMPIRES TO WORK PLAYOFF GAMES.</headline>
<dateline>PHILADELPHIA 1996-10-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Ludwig on Friday ordered Major League umpires to work baseball's playoffs, preventing a protest walkout over the handling of a suspension to Roberto Alomar for spitting in an umpire's face.</p>
<p>At a court hearing Ludwig granted Major League Baseball's request for a temporary restraining order sought to stop a threatened umpires' walkout over the disciplining the Baltimore Orioles star second baseman.</p>
<p>Judge Ludwig told the court he had ruled to order umpires to work because of baseball's special status in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Baseball holds a special place in our country. It belongs to all the millions of fans in America. Baseball is a higher calling than pure business,&quot; Ludwig said.</p>
<p>Umpires were enraged over what they viewed as unacceptably light punishment to Alomar, who was given a five-game suspension to be served at the beginning of next season for spitting in umpire John Hirschbeck's face during a dispute last Friday.</p>
<p>The umpires insisted that the only meaningful suspension had to take place immediately, during the playoffs.</p>
<p>Richard Phillips, attorney and spokesman for the umpires' union, had told the judge before the ruling was announced that umpires would abide by the order, subject to their ability to contest it after its 10-day expiration period.</p>
<p>He argued in court that the authority of the umpires and the dignity of baseball would be compromised if acts such as Alomar's were not dealt with severely.</p>
<p>&quot;Baseball is in a state of very serious decay,&quot; Phillips said. &quot;If this order, which these people (Major League officials) seek is granted, to quote from Shakespeare 'fair is foul and foul is fair.'&quot;</p>
<p>Baseball attorneys argued that umpires were bound to work by a no-strike clause in their collective bargaining agreement, despite their anger over the Alomar incident.</p>
<p>The judge did express sympathy with the position of the umpires, who were outraged that Alomar had been allowed to play in the Orioles' playoff games against Cleveland.</p>
<p>&quot;I agree with much of the arguments made by the umpires and their association,&quot; Ludwig said.</p>
<p>&quot;On a personal note, as an umpire, my feelings are certainly with the umpires. They deserve to be treated with dignity and authority.&quot;</p>
<p>However, he went on, &quot;there is no realistic replacement for umpires. They are the best in the world and there would be irreparable damage to baseball if they didn't work.&quot;</p>
<p>The judge's opinion notwithstanding, major league officials have had replacement umpires ready to work the playoff games if the regulars carried out their boycott.</p>
<p>The umpires originally threatened to boycott playoff openers on Tuesday after Alomar appealed his five-game suspension and American League President Gene Budig set the appeal hearing for next season.</p>
<p>The umpires agreed to work through Thursday's games only after Budig moved the appeal hearing up to Thursday. But Alomar withdrew his appeal on Wednesday night, circumventing the need for a hearing and leaving the umpires without a forum to argue for Alomar's immediate suspension.</p>
<p>Phillips then said the umpires would walk out, moving the dispute back to the courthouse.</p>
<p>Phillips argued that baseball's special place in American history was no longer a valid reason for granting the injunction sought by major league officials.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no longer social significance to the game of baseball. The only significance is economic significance,&quot; Phillips said.</p>
<p>Acting Commissioner Bud Selig, in addressing the court, said: &quot;We do understand our social responsibility.&quot;</p>
<p>Selig later said he would convene a summit after the World Series &quot;to discuss history, tensions and establish codes of conduct so that the Roberto Alomar incident never happens again.&quot;</p>
