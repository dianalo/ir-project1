<p>The government would not tolerate public enterprises who refused to be held accountable to parliament for their financial management, Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>She was reacting to complaints from members of the Democratic Party (DP) during a mini-debate about some public enterprises, notably transport utility Transnet, which had refused to appear before parliamentary committees to explain financial irregularities.</p>
<p>She said that committees should raise instances such as this with the relevant minister and, because it had been raised in parliament, she would also take the issue up.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think that there should be any neglect or any inability to have any of the entities to come before parliament to account for their finances,&quot; Marcus said.</p>
<p>Transnet has been dogged with controversy about the use of corporate credit cards and other financial irregularities.</p>
<p>&quot;The current situation in respect of public enterprises is unacceptable,&quot; DP finance spokesman Ken Andrew said.</p>
<p>The only specific accountability to parliament by public corporations was to submit copies of their annual reports, some of which were audited by the Auditor General and were referred to the public accounts committee.</p>
<p>&quot;But the biggest ones are not audited,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>This would be remedied by the Public Entities Amendment Bill, which aimed to increase the number of entities listed by government and which could be investigated at will by the Auditor-General.</p>
<p>But this would not be enough, Andrew said. He suggested that committees should more actively evaluate the financial performance of public enterprises, bringing in outside help if necessary.</p>
<p>Marcus said that as there were about 500 to 600 public corporations, parliament could be overwhelmed by such an approach but that the public accounts committee could help other committees study the financial aspects of the corporations' operations.</p>
<p>Andrew, who heads up this committee, agreed but said that financial scrutiny was made all the more urgent by the fact that some public corporations rivalled major private sector companies in terms of size and turnover.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the public enterprises we are talking about are high up in South Africa's top company giants league,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest three public enterprises have assets in excess of 100 billion rand in total. Eskom and Transnet each have more assets than De Beers, Gencor and South African Breweries and the combined assets of Eskom and Transnet alone are greater than those of the five biggest industrial companies of South Africa put together.</p>
<p>&quot;The turnover of  five largest public sector corporations now exceeds 50 billion rands a year.</p>
<p>&quot;This is big money in anyone's language. As trustees of taxpayers money, parliament should be taking a much closer interest in the financial performances of public enterprises.&quot;</p>
