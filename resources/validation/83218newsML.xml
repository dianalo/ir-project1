<p>An Australian doctor who oversaw the world's first legally-sanctioned mercy killing said on Saturday more deaths could follow within weeks.</p>
<p>Doctor Philip Nitschke said he had five patients waiting to use the Northern Territory's voluntary euthanasia law and the next death could happen soon.</p>
<p>&quot;It could be weeks,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Nitschke oversaw the death of former carpenter and one-time Christian missionary Bob Dent, 66, by lethal injection in this remote tropical city on Sunday. Dent was terminally ill with prostate cancer.</p>
<p>The Northern Territory law, the first in the world to sanction voluntary euthanasia, took effect in July but legal and political wrangles had previously prevented anyone using it to end their life under its terms.</p>
<p>Dent's death has sparked a fierce debate in Australian and abroad about the acceptability of legalised mercy killing. Euthanasia is still illegal in Australia's other states.</p>
<p>Political, religious and community leaders have condemned the territory legislation, saying it legalises murder.</p>
<p>As debate raged, the architect of the controversial law, former Northern Territory government chief Marshall Perron, urged Australians to lobby their national parliamentarians to reject calls to overturn the law.</p>
<p>Perron said politicians risked being swayed by the vocal anti-euthanasia lobby and ignoring overwhelming popular support for voluntary euthanasia.</p>
<p>&quot;The opponents scare politicians but the supporters do not,&quot; Perron said.</p>
<p>Government backbencher Kevin Andrews, with conservative Prime Minister John Howard's support, has launched a private bid in the national parliament to have Canberra use its constitutional powers to overturn the law.</p>
<p>Political leaders, including Howard and his deputy, Tim Fischer, have urged its repeal.</p>
<p>But various opinion polls show strong public support, with up to 80 percent of Australians in favour.</p>
