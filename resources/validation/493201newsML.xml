<p>A string of official statistics suggest the British economy is close to booming, yet the ruling Conservatives, trailing badly in the opinion polls, appear incapable of reaping the benefits.</p>
<p>Experts say that lack of support means either the &quot;feelgood&quot; factor has yet to reach much of the population or people do feel better off but are not inclined to give the government credit.</p>
<p>Either way it leaves John Major's government set to suffer a first -- to lose an election when the economy is blossoming.</p>
<p>A Reuter survey, conducted by pollsters NOP last Friday, showed 34 percent of voters think the Labour Party will best run the economy against 29 percent who backed the Tories.</p>
<p>It also showed 35 percent of the 1,088 people canvassed thought they would be better off financially under Labour. Only 28 percent said the Tories would deliver more wealth.</p>
<p>John Curtice, senior lecturer in politics at Strathclyde University, says the feelgood factor has returned to a large extent. The problem for the Tories is one of trust, he said. And that stems from September 1992 when the pound crashed out of Europe's exchange rate mechanism.</p>
<p>&quot;Black Wednesday rewrote the rules,&quot; Curtice said. &quot;People's perceptions of the Conservatives' ability to run the economy and avoid devaluation were completely changed.&quot;</p>
<p>Until four years ago, with Britain mired in the longest recession this century, house prices stagnant and perceived job security at an all-time low, nobody felt good.</p>
<p>&quot;But that shouldn't be a problem for the government now,&quot; Curtice said. &quot;Job insecurity has declined according to the data we use and the housing market has recovered.&quot;</p>
<p>Andrew Sentance, director of the London Business School's Centre for Economic Forecasting, largely agreed. But he said the attempt to keep sterling in the ERM was the killer blow. &quot;That saw interest rates forced up to 15 percent at one point and really shocked people. They haven't forgotten.&quot;</p>
<p>And sharp tax rises after the 1992 election flew in the face of Conservative governments' traditional tax-cutting stance, making voters more aware of the impact of indirect tax rises on their personal finances.</p>
<p>&quot;The backtracking on taxes was just as bad as the ERM debacle,&quot; Sentance said. &quot;The government's rating for economic competence has taken a real hammering.&quot;</p>
<p>Clarke has spent the first three weeks of the election campaign praising the health of the British economy in the hope that it will sway voters. &quot;Britain is booming, don't let Labour blow it,&quot; Conservative posters proclaim.</p>
<p>But the public remains suspicious. Labour's opinion poll lead holds rock steady at or above 20 points and elections are only three weeks away.</p>
<p>The official data suggest Clarke has a case. They show GDP growth ticking along nicely at about 2.5 percent year-on-year. Consumer spending is forecast to grow by at least four percent this year and unemployment has fallen for 16 months in succession, hitting a six-year low.</p>
<p>But the figures hide a more mixed picture. Millions of people are unable to bask in Britain's economic renaissance and are twice as likely to spurn the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at GDP figures, financial services and telecoms are doing extremely well, other sectors much less so,&quot; Sentance said. &quot;The whole economic picture is being pulled up by about 20 percent of the economy.&quot;</p>
<p>That phenomenon can be extended to the population at large, he said. &quot;Average living standards have improved but while some have done really quiet well, others have not benefited at all.&quot;</p>
<p>If the headline GDP figures mask the true picture, many analysts say unemployment data are even more suspect.</p>
<p>Analysts say many of the jobs created in the last two years have been part-time, lacking the cushions of a pension and guaranteed employment rights that most Britons take for granted.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think people are confident enough about the longevity of their employment that they can give a vote of confidence to the Conservatives. You see that everywhere,&quot; said Michael O'Hanlon, chief international economist at PaineWebber.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there have been about 30 changes to the way jobless figures have been calculated since the Conservatives took office. A report from Sheffield Hallam University says the real jobless total is more than double the official 1.8 million.</p>
<p>It said the gap is made up of unemployed people ineligible for benefits, those on government schemes or long-term jobless hidden among those registered as retired or permanently sick.</p>
<p>If they can find no solace there, the Conservatives can surely take heart from rocketing residential house prices -- forecast to rise by at least seven percent this year, according to the Halifax Building Society, and much faster in some areas.</p>
<p>But experts say this is a classic market squeeze, with too few properties coming onto the market to meet demand. Once the election is past, assuming interest rates do not go through the roof, more houses will go up for sale and prices will settle. And anyway, homeowners are still scarred by the experience of the late 1980s and early '90s when the housing bubble burst and prices plunged, leaving millions with properties worth less than their mortgages. Last week, the Halifax said prices are still 4.2 percent below their May 1989 peal.</p>
<p>To compound the government's woes, Curtice says internal party divisions will make doubly sure its fate is sealed.</p>
<p>He forecast Labour will win a massive 185-seat majority not just because of the Conservatives' economic record but also their inability to unite over issues like Europe. &quot;Politics matters and the Tories have looked divided ever since 1992.&quot;</p>
