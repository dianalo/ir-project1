<p>Mercury Finance Co said Thursday its creditors granted waivers allowing a 90-day extension of its $50 million line of credit with BankAmerica Corp's Bank of America.</p>
<p>The waivers permit Mercury to continue to pledge assets as collateral on the $50 million credit facility. The previous waiver period had only been for 30 days, Mercury said.</p>
<p>&quot;The waivers and the term of the loan now extend out to June 10, 1997,&quot; said the sub-prime auto lender.</p>
<p>&quot;This 90-day extension is a tangible demonstration of confidence in Mercury,&quot; said chief executive William Brandt.  </p>
<p>&quot;The expanded waiver period gives the company breathing room to focus on operations and on the exploration of long term financing alternatives,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the waivers, during the 90-day period, the company will resume interest payments on nearly all of its roughly $1 billion in debt and will pay any interest that is now past due, Mercury said.</p>
<p>&quot;The company is continuing discussions with the holders of $22 million of subordinated debt regarding the status of their interest payments,&quot; the company said.  </p>
<p>Mercury received the $50 million in short term financing from Bank of America a month ago. The financing is being used to meet daily operating expenses and interest payments as Mercury confronts numerous difficulties.</p>
<p>The company faces a federal investigation, several shareholder lawsuits, restatement of financial results due to accounting irregularities, and a loss of more than $2 billion in market capitalization after a plunge in its stock price.</p>
<p>The share price fell in January -- after the news of the earnings restatement -- from $14 to less than $2 per share. It closed Wednesday at $2-5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
