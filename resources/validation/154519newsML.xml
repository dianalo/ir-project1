<p>The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) said on Wednesday it is actively in talks with other exchanges as part of its overall strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;LIFFE is actively seeking links with other exchanges. Because of that we're actively talking to a number of exchanges,&quot; a LIFFE spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The LIFFE official declined to give details of any potentially imminent link-ups. She said links with exchanges in other time zones were the priority but that business for trade in euro-denominated contracts was also an important issue.  </p>
<p>&quot;As part of our strategy we are looking at other exchanges in other time zones, and also possibly in our time zone but that is obviously less important to us,&quot; the LIFFE official said.</p>
<p>&quot;But you have to take into consideration the battle for the euro which is going to be fought among all the European exchanges,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The official noted LIFFE already has links with the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange (TIFFE) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange in the Far East. In the U.S., it has made plans to start an open outcry link with the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) in May 1997.  </p>
<p>In September, LIFFE said it was launching a one-month Euromark future as part of its strategy to win business after a single currency is introduced under European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).</p>
<p>In March, LIFFE set plans for allowing 1999 Euromark contracts to settle in the new euro currency.</p>
<p>A single European currency is scheduled to start on January 1, 1999.</p>
