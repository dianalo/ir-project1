<p>This week's parliamentary approval of a drastic overhaul of the pension system represents an important step in budgetary and capital market reforms, Finance Minister Peter Medgyessy said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision will affect the whole of society for many generations,&quot; Medgyessy told a news conference.</p>
<p>The parliament passed the pension reform bills on Tuesday, to supplement the Communist-type &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; system with private pension funds into which Hungarians will pay about 25 percent of compulsory pension contributions.</p>
<p>The new system will begin in January 1998.</p>
<p>Medgyessy said the proportion of the inactive members of the population was increasing in Hungary and would make the old system unfinancable in the longer term.</p>
<p>By introducing a private tier, Hungary was applying a similar solution to the problem as most countries of the European Union do or plan to do, Medgyessy said, adding that Poland also planned similar measures.</p>
<p>Contributions to be paid into private funds and their yields will be held on individual accounts and will be inheritable. Medgyessy said the system would motivate people to work more and would reduce evasion of contribution payments, which he said was widespread.</p>
<p>According to the Finance Ministry's calculations, by the year 2005 the private funds will hold a total amount equivalent to some 4.2 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). He expected them to invest mainly in the country's fledgling capital markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Three to five year will pass before this will really move the capital markets, but the impact is expected to be felt already from the third year,&quot; Medgyessy said.</p>
<p>The private funds may also become large across-the-border investors as they are allowed to invest a maximum 30 percent of their assets in securities issued abroad.</p>
<p>The launch of the new sytem will cause losses to the old social security pension fund, but the government will cover the fund's deficit, which is expected to remain below one percent of the GDP each year and turn into a surplus from 2003.</p>
<p>Medgyessy said Hungary will continue to overhaul the public sector using a gradual approach.</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot shock society continuously,&quot; he said, adding that preparations for health care reform were likely to finish by 1999 while work on the planned reform of the financing system of local municipalities will begin this autumn.</p>
<p>The government has made efforts in the past two years to cut the government health care fund's bloated deficit by stricter control on expenditures, but analysts say only a drastic overhaul could resolve underlying structural problems.</p>
