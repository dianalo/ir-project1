<p>One of the unions representing staff at Barclays Bank said on Wednesday that industrial action is &quot;almost inevitable&quot; in its dispute with the bank over pay.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision to cut pay at a time of record profits has already hurt the bank very badly in terms of staff goodwill and morale, and feedback from members so far would suggest that industrial action is now almost inevitable,&quot; said UNiFI general secretary Paul Snowball in a statement.</p>
<p>UNiFI and finance workers' union BIFU are balloting around 40,000 Barclays staff for strike action over proposals which they say could leave over 25,000 staff facing a wage freeze and adversely affect pension expectations.</p>
<p>The union said Martin Taylor, chief executive of Barclays has written to the unions and John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) saying that union members would be &quot;taking a great risk with the business&quot; if they took strike action.</p>
<p>Snowball said it was the bank's directors who were taking risks by trying to &quot;impose massive cuts in the pay and pensions expectations of the workforce without facing the consequences.&quot;</p>
<p>Barclays declined to release the full text of Taylor's letter but has already urged staff to vote against strike action, accusing the unions of ignoring the views of the &quot;silent majority&quot; and estimating that only one in six members of Barclays staff voted in favour of holding the strike ballot.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a low turnout does not suggest that union members have any enthusiasm for industrial action,&quot; a Barclays spokesman said in a recent statement. &quot;The silent majority of members clearly tore their ballot papers up.&quot;</p>
<p>Barclays has warned that staff who take industrial action will be in breach of their contracts.</p>
<p>Barclays said union claims it is instigating a pay and pensions freeze were &quot;simply untrue&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;All staff have the potential to increase their earnings in the future through salary increases and/or performance related bonuses,&quot; the Barclays spokesman added.</p>
<p>The ballot, being conducted by unions UNiFI and BIFU, asks members if they are prepared to take industrial action including two- or three-day strikes and a ban on overtime, BIFU said in a statement earlier.</p>
<p>Balloting is due to finish on July 24 and the result will be announced on July 25.</p>
<p>The unions, which together represent more than three quarters of all Barclays staff, oppose what they call Barclays' plan to impose a new pay and grading structure based on performance which will result in a pay and pensions freeze for over half of staff.</p>
<p>The motive behind the company's plan is to cut staff costs and to cap staff's potential earnings, the unions say.</p>
<p>Barclays denied its plan will produce a pay freeze but has conceded that staff whose pay is at the top of a particular salary band would not get a pay rise regardless of whether they exceeded their agreed performance plan.</p>
<p>But the Bank said that over time, salary bands would move, allowing staff headroom to receive a performance-related increase.</p>
