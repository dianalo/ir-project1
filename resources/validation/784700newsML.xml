<p>The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) said it would not hold any refinancing repo tender on Thursday as it considered market liquidity sufficient.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on our monitoring of both the money market and the foreign exchange flows, we expect sufficient market liquidity in coming days,&quot; Peter Andresic, Head of the NBS Open Market Operation Department told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Andresic said market liquidity may slightly tighten on Thursday, but he added that the NBS expected &quot;a liquidity improvement in the near future.&quot; He would not elaborate.</p>
<p>The central bank monitors market liquidity daily and decides each morning whether to hold any open market operations.</p>
<p>The fulfilment of minimum reserves requirement by commercial banks is a main NBS yardstick for assessing money market liquidity.</p>
<p>According to NBS figures, the Slovak banking sector as of August 6 lacked 0.34 percent of cumulative funds needed to meet minimum reserves requirements later this month.</p>
<p>The daily volume of minimum reserves for commercial banks totals 36.817 billion crowns in the current reserves period ending August 15.</p>
<p>The latest NBS repo operation was a one-week refinancing repo tender on Wednesday when the central bank added 2.0 billion crowns at an average rate of 18.17 percent, down from 18.32 percent in a similar repo on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Some 2.717 billion crowns are expected to flow to the market in maturing state securities on Thursday, while at the same time 2.377 billion crowns will leave the market as payments for state bonds and treasury bills auctioned on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.</p>
