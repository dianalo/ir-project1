<p>UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund, said on Friday there should be restrictions on promoting and selling tobacco products worldwide, especially to children and adolescents in poor countries.</p>
<p>Executive director Carol Bellamy said the most promising market for new smokers were young populations in the developing world.</p>
<p>Governments as well as the World Trade Organisation should develop &quot;a global strategy to treat tobacco products commensurate with the harm they cause,&quot; she said in a statement. This should begin with prohibitions on all direct and indirect cigarette advertising aimed at young people.</p>
<p>Other measures, she said, should include a ban on sales of tobacco products to minors, substantial tax increases on cigarettes and other tobacco products and educational campaigns to promote awareness of the addictiveness of nicotine and the dangers of smoking.</p>
<p>&quot;The tobacco companies know that their best customers are those they snare early in life,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;The calculated expansion of the tobacco market to these regions is a direct challenge to UNICEF's efforts to save impoverished children from diseases,&quot; Bellamy said.</p>
<p>Cigarette sales in developing countries have risen substantially in recent years. Among children and teenagers, 300 million will die from tobacco in adulthood if current trends continue. A third of such deaths occur in developing countries now and the figure is expected to rise to two-thirds early in the next century.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation has projected that 10 million people a year will die worldwide from tobacco-related illnesss by the year 2025, more than triple the current toll, and that 7 million of these deaths will be adults in poor countries, most of whom began smoking at a young age.</p>
<p>In the United States, mounting legal pressures have forced industry representatives to try to negotiate a settlement. A U.S. district court last week ruled that the government can regulate tobacco sales and marketing, but not promotion and advertising.</p>
