<p>Belgium's top public prosecutor is looking into unspecified new allegations against Deputy Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo, who was cleared a month ago of charges he had sex with under-age boys.</p>
<p>Public prosecutor Eliane Liekendael, head of the Cour de Cassation, the country's top court, told a parliamentary committee in remarks broadcast on television on Wednesday that she had been provided with fresh information.</p>
<p>&quot;Judge Fischer, who led the investigations, has received some new elements since the decision. He has sent them on to me,&quot; she told the committee on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>&quot;I have also received information from some other public prosecutors. I think I will assemble all of this and send it to the Brussels public prosecutor asking him to investigate.&quot;</p>
<p>She refused to give details of the fresh allegations.</p>
<p>Liekendael later told BRTN radio that she had received letters about several other government ministers, but stressed that the fact that somebody wrote a letter &quot;does not mean it is well founded -- certainly not&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;There are at least five (ministers) and I will get letters about the entire government,&quot; she said, referring to Belgium's current climate of suspicion.</p>
<p>In December, after weeks of bitter arguments, Belgium's governing centre-left coalition used its parliamentary muscle to throw out allegations that Di Rupo had indulged in sex with boys under the legal age of consent of 16 years.</p>
<p>Di Rupo, a francophone socialist, had consistently denied the allegations of having under-age sex and accused his political opponents of &quot;machinations&quot;.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the parliament of the Francophone Walloon region voted to partially lift the immunity from prosecution of former regional government minister Jean-Pierre Grafe, facing allegations similar to those against Di Rupo.</p>
<p>Grafe, who also rejects the charges, resigned as Walloon interior affairs minister in December stating that he could no longer continue in office in the climate of denunciation.</p>
<p>The allegations against Di Rupo were unconnected to a child sex and abduction scandal that has shaken Belgium since August.</p>
<p>Convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux was arrested and two sexually-abused young girls rescued from a makeshift dungeon in the cellar of a house he owned in the central city of Charleroi.</p>
<p>Within days police found the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo buried alongside that of former Dutroux accomplice Bernard Weinstein, in the garden of another house belonging to the 40-year-old unemployed father of three.</p>
<p>The two girls had died of starvation some nine months after being abducted in June 1995.</p>
<p>Two weeks later police unearthed the bodies of two teenage girls, An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, under a shed on another Charleroi property connected with Dutroux. The two girls had disappeared a year earlier.</p>
<p>A special parliamentary commission looking into the handling by police and magistrates of the searches for the missing girls has uncovered a catalogue of bungling.</p>
<p>Police, who have spent 26 fruitless days weeks digging for clues about more missing children in an abandoned mining complex in Charleroi, are still searching on the basis of information from Dutroux' second wife Michelle Martin who is also in jail.</p>
<p>In October more than 250,000 people took to the streets of Brussels to demand a complete overhaul of the judicial and political system in the country's biggest ever peacetime demonstration.</p>
<p>The government has tabled a number of legal changes and promised to create a special centre to search for abducted and missing children, but people are impatient and the political opposition is taking every opportunity to rock the boat.</p>
<p>National elections are not due until 1999.</p>
