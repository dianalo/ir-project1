<title>GREECE: Greek depo, forwards, bonds hold, ecu/drs hug 311.</title>
<headline>Greek depo, forwards, bonds hold, ecu/drs hug 311.</headline>

<p>Ecu/drachma was hovering around 311 in early quiet dealing, depos and forex forwards were holding late Friday levels displaying a downward bias and bonds were steady to slightly lower, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The drachma is holding its ground against the ecu hugging 311 in early thin trading,&quot; a dealer at a private bank said. &quot;The market is very quiet unaffected by the Left's victory in France.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected last week's pressure on the drachma to dissipate and ecu/drachma as well as mark/drachma to trade in narrow ranges.</p>
<p>Interbank depo rates and forex forwards were stable to easier in calm early dealing, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very quiet so far,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank. &quot;Depos and forex forwards hold late Friday levels but it seems to me that they are soft and might recede further during the day.&quot;</p>
<p>Bond prices were steady to slightly lower in thin trading and dealers said the French election outcome could benefit EMU outsiders like Greece.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike core markets, peripheral markets such as Greece might gain from the French election outcome because it could lead to some relaxation of EMU membership rules,&quot; said a bond traeer at a private bank. &quot;Italian assets has already gained ground.&quot;</p>
<p>The 12-month T-bill carrying a gross rate of 9.60 percent hits the market today. This is 10 basis points lower than the previous issue.</p>
<p>&quot;We will see how the annual T-bill sells today,&quot; a trader said. &quot;If it does not sell well, interbnak liquidity will be boosted pushing short-term money rates down.&quot;</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 159.88/93 from Friday's 159.935 fix, the dollar at 273.92/02 drachmas from 271.25 and the ecu at 310.92/02 from 311.000 drachmas.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece, the domestic money market's biggest player, quoted the following early rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at 10.20-10.70</p>
<p>** T/N at 10.20-10.70</p>
