<p>The Indian cabinet has approved a proposed law to throw open broadcasting to private firms, but the law would limit foreign partners to minority shareholdings, a senior official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Comprehensive Broadcast Law, which is expected to be presented before parliament next week, aims to end a state monopoly over airwaves and allow satellite broadcasters to air signals from India.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's cabinet approved the proposed law on Tuesday. It must be passed by parliament before it comes into effect.</p>
<p>It would permit cable television stations to beam into Indian homes only if they have licences to uplink their signals from India, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Indian firms will be granted both terrestrial and satellite broadcast rights, he said.</p>
<p>Satellite broadcasters, led by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp-owned Star TV, currently broadcast to India from Hong Kong and other centres.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, foreign service providers are not accountable to any Indian law,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;While foreign satellite service providers have absolute freedom to broadcast anything, Indians cannot start broadcasting because private broadcasting is not allowed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The new law will change all that. There will be a level playing-field.&quot;</p>
<p>The government plans to grant licences to all broadcasters currently beaming into India, but they will need to bid for licences to provide direct-to-home (DTH) services. Loss-making Hong Kong-based Star TV in March said it planned to pour hundreds of millions of dollars in India's first DTH satellite pay channel.</p>
<p>&quot;All we are telling Star is: Please wait a few months and then come under the law. Don't try to evade competition by trying to become an established player,&quot; the official said. The government said it would set up a broadcasting regulator, which would be instructed to give priority to signals beamed through Indian satellites.</p>
<p>India began opening up key sectors under an economic liberalisation programme launched in 1991, but the state still owns radio and television stations.</p>
<p>Currently, private broadcasters can rent time-slots and their content is monitored. There are dozens of such slots, mainly for entertainment programmes.</p>
<p>Foreign companies will be allowed to uplink from India only in partnership with Indian firms, which will need to hold a majority of the joint venture's equity, the official said. &quot;Licences will be necessary to receive signals in India. These will be given only to Indian companies,&quot; the official said. &quot;All existing channels will get licences.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the new law, India planned to auction up to three licences for DTH satellite services, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;DTH is a very powerful medium. It goes straight from the satellite to the viewers' homes, and all the channels are encrypted.</p>
<p>We need some regulation over this,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The new law would grant functional autonomy to state-run All India Radio and Doordarshan television.</p>
<p>It would also place curbs on ownership of more than one medium, the official said. Industry officials say this would restrict newspaper publishing houses from extending their hold to radio and television.</p>
<p>Owners of one medium would be allowed to hold only up to 20 percent of the equity in a single firm of another medium but could hold scattered stakes of less than five percent in several media, the official said.</p>
