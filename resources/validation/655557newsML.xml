<p>The NBA will announce Thursday what punishment, if any, it will levy on Dennis Rodman for his obscenity-laced comments about Mormons, the league announced before Game 5 of the Finals Wednesday.</p>
<p>The struggling Chicago Bulls forward said last Saturday he could not get his game in sync against the Utah Jazz because of all the &quot;asshole Mormons&quot; in the state. He conceivably could be suspended when the Finals return to Chicago Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the matter under review and, if the statements are as reported, they are obviously offensive and inexcusable,&quot; NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;A full report will be made to Commissioner (David) Stern upon his return to New York tomorrow, and an announcement of any action can be expected by the end of the day.&quot;</p>
<p>Anti-bigotry groups such as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) have condemned Rodman's remarks.</p>
<p>The local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP), which normally focuses on black issues, said in a statement: &quot;We must not allow double standards in the area of bigotry and ignorance.&quot;</p>
<p>The NAACP statement compared Rodman's comments to golfer Fuzzy Zoeller's controversial, racially stereotyped jokes about Tiger Woods.</p>
<p>The Mormon church -- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- has declined comment on the controversy.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, NBA spokesman Brian McIntyre had called Rodman's comments &quot;indefensible&quot; but said the league would not take action until after the Finals, which move to Chicago for Game 6 on Friday and, if needed, Game 7 on Sunday.</p>
<p>Rodman compounded his problems Tuesday when he tried to explain and defend his comment: &quot;The Mormon people here don't like me either, right?&quot; He said he was the target of the same expletive when he travelled around the state, as well as obscene gestures.</p>
<p>Mormons, who trekked here to escape religious persecution 150 years ago, today make up about 70 percent of the population of Utah, which will host the 2002 Winter Olympics. They are extremely influential in laws and practices on morality/lifestyle issues.</p>
<p>Rodman -- known for his flamboyant appearance and behaviour as much as for his six rebounding championships -- fled strait-laced Utah to relax in anything-goes Las Vegas in neighbouring Nevada for two nights in a row.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old, 11-year NBA veteran has won three NBA titles -- two with the Detroit Pistons and one with last season's Bulls.</p>
