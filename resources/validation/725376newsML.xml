<p>Activity at the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) rose on Monday after slumping last week to its lowest level since May, but brokers said the underlying tone was still nervous.</p>
<p>Fresh clashes on Monday between police and students made no easily discernible impact on the market as conflict was centred on Haile Selassie Avenue, some distance from the Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The NSE-20 share index eased 6.03 points to close at 3496.74.</p>
<p>Turnover was posted at 31.584 million shillings traded on 765,717 shares compared to 18.002 million shillings on 365,025 shares on Friday.</p>
<p>Brokers said investor confidence in the Kenyan market had been shaken last week after the worst political unrest in the country in seven years closed the city's commercial district on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We might be looking at a very sluggish six months to come if the political scene does not change,&quot; a broker told Reuters.</p>
<p>Last week's entire trading was the lowest since May.</p>
<p>Kenya Commercial Bank edged up to 102 from 101 on Monday while Barclays Bank eased to 110 from 111. Standard Chartered Bank was unchanged at 50.50.</p>
<p>Brooke Bond closed at 123 from 122 while Rea Vipingo edged up to close at 10.10 from 10.05.</p>
<p>Uchumi Supermarket closed at 38 from 37.50 while Kenya Airways was unchanged at 8.</p>
<p>Some 300,000 shares of Firestone East Africa traded at a reserve price of 34 from 29.25 on the three-day special board.</p>
<p>Foreign investors traded National Industrial Credit Bank at between 57.50 and 60 from 57.</p>
<p>The fourth issue of the floating-rate treasury bond traded 250,000 shillings at 101.1256 percent from 101.2147 percent.</p>
