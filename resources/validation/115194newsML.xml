<title>AUSTRIA: Austria's Lauda sees steady '96 profit.</title>

<p>Austrian airline Lauda Air said on Monday it expected 1995/96 full-year earnings to be on par with last year's results.</p>
<p>Lauda reported net profit of 47.1 million schillings on turnover of 2.67 billion for the year to October 31, 1995.</p>
<p>Former Formula One racing champion and chief executive Niki Lauda predicted profit after tax this year would be between 40 and 50 million schillings on turnover of about three billion.</p>
<p>&quot;We will also pay the same dividend,&quot; he added. Last year the company paid a dividend of four schillings on common stock, while holders of participation certificates received eight schillings.</p>
<p>Lauda said the first half had been typically poor during the winter season, but the summer had been profitable.</p>
<p>The company had increased its ratio of scheduled flights to charter traffic to 60:40 compared with 35:65 two years ago.</p>
<p>But relations with arch rival Austrian Air had deteriorated, Lauda said. A cooperation deal struck by the two airlines in February had come to nothing, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;There have not yet been any concrete attacks, but we may also consider flying to New York,&quot; said Lauda. A deal with Lufthansa-partner United Airlines would be conceivable as Lufthansa holds a 39.7 percent share in Lauda.</p>
<p>Lauda also indicated he was eyeing a foray into eastern Europe -- until now the domain of state-controlled Austrian Air.</p>
