<headline>GOLF-DUNLAP GRABS EARLY LEAD AT CANADIAN OPEN.</headline>
<text>
<p>OAKVILLE, Ontario, Sept 5 (Reuter) Scott Dunlap fired a 8-under-par 64 on Thursday to grab a two-stroke lead after the first round of the $1.5 million Canadian Open at the Glen Abbey Golf Club.</p>
<p>Dunlap, who carded six birdies in a bogey-free round, has never won a tournament, although he had his best finish here last year when he finished eighth.</p>
<p>Jesper Parnevik, who spent most of day in the lead, shot a 6-under-par 66, with eight golfers three strokes back at 5-under.</p>
<p>&quot;I was looking forward to coming back here&quot;, Dunlap said. &quot;My game was starting to feel good and I was playing a place I knew well. So I started with the best attitude I've had in a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>The 33-year-old Dunlap birdied four holes on the front nine, including consecutive birdies on the fifth and sixth. He missed a chance at eagle on the par-5 fifth when he two-putted for biride. He then used a 6-iron to get within five feet of the hole on the sixth.</p>
<p>Dunlap added a birdie on eight and again on 13 before carding an eagle on the par-5 16th. He closed out the round with a birdie on the 18th.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything that could go right today did,&quot; Dunlap said. &quot;Whenever you get going good, you remember those previous good rounds and use them to keep confidence going and get yourself into the house.&quot;</p>
<p>Parnevik also shot a bogey-free round with three birdies on the front nine, including one at the par-3 seventh hole when his 7-iron tee shot left him five feet from the cup.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old Parnevik, who finished tied for third at the Greater Milwaukee Open last week, added three more birdies on the back nine.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt bad on the range,&quot; said Parnevik. &quot;I couldn't loosen up. I hit a terrible drive on the first hole and had to 5-iron in. Last week was a tough one. After two-putting 17, all I was thinking was birdie on 18.&quot;</p>
<p>Justin Leonard, Ernie Els, Billy Mayfair, Arden Knoll, Frank Lickliter, Andrew Magee, Guy Hill and Carl Paulson are all three shots behind the leader at 5-under.</p>
<p>Defending champion Mark O'Meara struggled to a 2-over 74.</p>
<p>Tiger Woods, making his second professional appearance, is 2-under 70 after the first round.</p>
<p>The par-72 Glen Abbey Golf Club course measures 7,112 yards. First prize is $270,000.</p>
