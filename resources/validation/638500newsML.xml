<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan dollar edges to lower close in range trade.</title>
<headline>Taiwan dollar edges to lower close in range trade.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-06-04</dateline>

<p>The Taiwan dollar ended slightly lower on Wednesday, continuing a slowly depreciating trend dating to mid-January, dealers said.</p>
<p>Some dealers said they saw U.S. dollar selling emerge when the Taiwan unit slipped to the T$27.90 level early in the day and said they suspected this was orchestrated by the central bank in a bid to smooth the Taiwan dollar's fall.</p>
<p>The local unit dipped to an intraday low of T$27.902 but rebounded a bit to end at T$27.891 against Tuesday's T$27.880 close. Turnover through dealers was an active US$258 million.  </p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar has not closed lower since finishing at T$27.892 on May 28, 1996.</p>
<p>Dealers said demand for the U.S. dollar remained heavy in part because of the greenback's strength in overseas markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand for the U.S. dollar is still quite active, but it seems the central bank had orchestrated a minor intervention to smooth the fall,&quot; said one dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>A second dealer said: &quot;The central bank has become very skillful in its intervention recently. We can't tell for sure if the central bank had intervened.&quot;</p>
<p>A narrow range of T$27.87-92 was seen for Thursday.</p>
