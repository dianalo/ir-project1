<p>U.S. West Coast light crudes climbed with a slighter higher WTI/Cushing market on Friday, while differentials stayed flat amid thin discussion, traders said.</p>
<p>A small parcel of Line 63 crude sold Thursday for $1.00 over California Buena Vista crude. The deal, confirmed by both buyer and seller, amounted to 1,000 bpd for March delivery to a mid-sized Los Angeles refiner.</p>
<p>Smaller refiners also sought similar-sized deals of Line 63, a lookalike for Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude, at the same price.  </p>
<p>Traders said Line 63 prices stood at postings plus $0.95 - $1.05, with the WTI-based market assessed at minus $1.95 to minus $1.85 under WTI. Buyers and sellers said supplies remain adequate for March.</p>
<p>ANS prices moved up with March spot WTI, which rose five cents from Thursday to $21.95/22.05 a barrel.</p>
<p>BP, the main seller of ANS, continued to decline an offering price, with buyers claiming they have ship scheduling problems.</p>
<p>BP denied it had scheduling problems, and has said it remains out of the market to assess its supplies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, buyers said March business was nearly over for ANS. They remained out of the market to determined what month to peg bids off of.</p>
<p>Some buyers continued to shop for foreign curdes, traders said, but deliveries were unlikely to reach refineries until early April.</p>
<p>Kern River heavy crude remained $14 53/14.73 a barrel, trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said Texaco plans to bring in a 300,000 barrel ship of Eocene crude, a grade similar to California's Outer Continental Shelf (OSC) grade which is shipped down Line 63 from mid-California to refineries in the southern half of the state.</p>
<p>Traders said the import could displace some of Texaco's OCS business.</p>
