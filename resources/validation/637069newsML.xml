<p>U.S. municipal bonds ended unchanged to up 1/8 point, outperforming U.S. Treasuries, which ended lower.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything with good structure just has an excellent bid,&quot; a California trader said, adding that paper in that state was up 1/4 point overall.</p>
<p>&quot;There's just no bonds, there is no supply,&quot; he said. &quot;Serials, wow, I mean serials are on fire. You've got clean insured stuff in '02 through a 4.50. I don't know what to do with that.&quot;</p>
<p>Whether levels are getting too high is open to debate, the trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;How high is high? I guess it's too high when the buyers stop,&quot; he said. &quot;They are still buying some stuff so I'm just kind of going with the trade.&quot;</p>
<p>A second trader observed that many fund managers are being forced to buy paper at levels they know are imprudent because they are trying to make up for yield lost as bonds being called in June and July. While this year's calls are not overwhelming, players are faced with trying to replace bonds yielding 7.0 percent in the current market environment.</p>
<p>&quot;They need to replace with the highest yielding thing possible because their dividend will get cut otherwise,&quot; the trader said. &quot;It doesn't make any sense to buy an AMT housing bond at 50 basis points off highgrades because you used to be able to buy it at 80 off, but they are doing it in the pursuit of yield. And the more they do it, the more the spread keeps coming in.&quot;</p>
<p>Back in Wednesday's muni cash market, a municipal analyst said the overall muni market ended flat to up 1/8 point. High-grade issues ended slightly higher overall, with an improvement of nearly two basis points seen in the longer intermediate range. Dollar bonds opened flat and weakened slightly after morning economic data. They were up 1/8 point by 1400 to 1430 EDT, and finished there, though a softer bias was evident near day's end.</p>
<p>In the government market, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 5/32 at 96-24/32 to yield 6.88 percent in late New York trade. In debt futures, the September municipal contract closed up 5/32 at 116-2/32. The September T-bond contract closed down 2/32 at 110-1/32. The MOB spread was 193 ticks.</p>
<p>In economic news Wednesday, April U.S. factory orders rose 1.2 percent versus forecasts for a 0.8 percent rise. The March drop was revised up slightly. Looming on Friday is the May employment report. Economists polled by Reuters expect a 219,000 increase in non-farm payrolls.</p>
<p>As for new issues, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co said it repriced a $159 million School District of Philadelphia various purpose general obligation bond issue, cutting yields in various maturities. Merrill lowered the top yield in 2027 to 5.675 percent from 5.70 percent.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs &amp; Co said it repriced $75 million Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency bonds, lowering yields in several maturities. The top tax-exempt yield was left unchanged at 5.95 percent in 2028.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, municipal bond sales for Thursday are expected to total $113 million in 17 sales, according to Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group.</p>
<p>Negotiated offerings are expected to total $33 million in two sales, with a $21 million South Carolina Housing Finance Development Authority deal through Goldmann, Sachs &amp; Co. topping the list.</p>
<p>On the competitive side, 14 sales totaling $80 million are scheduled. A $18 million Cupertino Unified School District, Calif., deal is the largest.</p>
<p>An additional two sales totaling $157 million are on the possible calender, meaning underwriters have said they may price the issues Thursday depending on market conditions.</p>
<p>Reuters 30-day visible supply of municipal bond sales stood at $4.519 billion on Wednesday.</p>
