<title>ITALY: Madonna dedicates Italy premiere to Mastroianni.</title>
<headline>Madonna dedicates Italy premiere to Mastroianni.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1996-12-20</dateline>

<p>Pop singer turned actress Madonna on Friday dedicated the Italian premiere of the film musical Evita to actor Marcello Mastroianni, the quintessential Latin lover who died on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I would also like to dedicate this screening to Marcello Mastroianni, a beautiful man, a great artist and one of the greatest gifts Italy has ever given the world,&quot; Madonna told viewers before the premiere in Rome.</p>
<p>Spanish actor Antonio Banderas, who plays Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara in the film, also dedicated the premiere to the Italian actor.</p>
<p>Mastroianni, who portrayed the Latin lover in many of his 160 post-war films, died of cancer in his Paris apartment on Thursday, aged 72.</p>
<p>He was perhaps best known for playing the suave reporter in Federico Fellini's 1959 classic &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (The Sweet Life) alongside Swedish bombshell Anita Eckberg.</p>
<p>Madonna arrived in Rome on Friday for the Italian premiere of Evita, which was released last Saturday in Los Angeles and is already spawning talk of Oscars.</p>
<p>Madonna plays Argentina's late Eva Peron in the film, a screen version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.</p>
<p>Madonna, wearing dark glasses and a headscarf, held her three-month-old baby Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon in her arms as she emerged from Rome's Ciampino airport into the glare of television lights and photographers' flashes.</p>
<p>The child was hidden from view behind a white shawl. Screaming fans waiting for the star outside Rome's swish Hotel Hassler were acknowledged with a smile from Madonna but not a glimpse of her baby.</p>
<p>The father, Carlos Leon, is the star's personal trainer.</p>
