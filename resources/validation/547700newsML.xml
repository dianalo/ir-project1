<p>By Rich Miller, U.S. Economics Correspondent</p>
<p>Economic policymakers from rich and poor nations on Tuesday wound up a series of meetings that left more questions open than they answered -- from the direction of the dollar to the future of financing for the IMF.</p>
<p>With the world economic outlook rosy and no sign of any crisis on the horizon, finance ministers and central bank chiefs could afford to wait to resolve the uncertainties facing them.</p>
<p>But in speech after speech at the semi-annual gathering of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, they admitted that the problems could not be ducked for long.</p>
<p>&quot;There seems to be somewhat greater optimism about the outlook for growth,&quot; U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said. &quot;But that was tempered by a recognition of the many challenges we each still face.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps the most immediate one is posed by the continued buoyancy of the U.S. dollar on world currency markets.</p>
<p>To a large extent, the greenback's steep rise over the past two years has been good news for the world economy.</p>
<p>By holding down the prices of products imported into the United States, the strong dollar has helped contain inflation here at a time when economic growth has been strong.</p>
<p>And by boosting the competitiveness of European and Japanese exports on world markets, it has given the struggling economies of those two areas a much-needed lift.</p>
<p>But now there is a suspicion that the dollar may have risen a bit too far, especially against the Japanese yen, and that the world economy may, in the words of IMF chief economist Michael Mussa, soon get &quot;too much of a good thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Washington and Tokyo, in particular, are concerned that the yen's weakness -- it has fallen by more than 50 percent against the dollar since April 1995 -- will push up Japan's trade surplus, fuelling friction with its American ally.</p>
<p>During the meetings here, major industrial nations stepped up their war of words aimed at talking the currency markets out of pushing the dollar ever higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals and excess volatility and significant deviations from fundamentals are undesirable,&quot; the Group of Seven -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- said on Sunday.</p>
<p>But the financial markets did not pay much attention, at least initially. In the immediate aftermath of the G7 meeting, the dollar rose to a three-year high against the German mark and to just shy of a four-and-a-half year peak versus the yen.</p>
<p>The greenback fell back a bit subsequently, losing ground against the mark on Tuesday, after signs that the U.S. economy may not be overheating helped dampen expectations of higher American interest rates. Higher rates would make the dollar a more lucrative currency for investors to hold.</p>
<p>IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus indicated that he expects the high-flying dollar to ebb in the coming months as economic growth slows in the United States and picks up in Japan and Germany.</p>
<p>As has happened at past meetings, Camdesuss was frustrated here in his efforts to get more funding for his agency, which effectively acts as policeman of the world economy.</p>
<p>The IMF chief had been asking for a doubling of the IMF's resources from their current level of nearly $200 billion.</p>
<p>But he shaved back that request after Mexico bounced back quickly from its currency crisis of 1994/95 and repaid some of the money it had borrowed from the IMF. Several major industrial nations, perhaps most notably the United States, still feel he is asking for too much.</p>
<p>The IMF also failed to reach agreement on a proposal to issue some $30 billion worth of its artificial currency to member nations, a move that would have pumped up global liquidity and particularly helped former Communist nations.</p>
<p>One of the few initiatives that was launched during the meetings was a multi-billion dollar debt relief plan for poor nations carrying out tough economic reforms. Uganda will be the first to benefit, although it will have to wait until next year before it sees some $340 million in debts written off.</p>
