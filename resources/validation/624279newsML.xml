<headline>Israeli bonds close unchanged in heavy trading.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1997-05-29</dateline>

<p>Israeli bonds closed virtually unchanged on Thursday as players continued to cash in bonds and move money into equities, traders said.</p>
<p>Indices:</p>
<p>* Government bonds general: -0.01 pct to 106.40</p>
<p>* CPI-linked government bonds: -0.02 pct at 106.37</p>
<p>* Unlinked government bonds: -0.04 pct to 107.02</p>
<p>* Dollar-linked government bonds: +0.18 pct to 105.28</p>
<p>* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: +0.02 pct to 105.70</p>
<p>Volume including Makams was a high 243 million shekels.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices for short-term CPI-linked bonds fell today with yields rising, while prices of long-term CPI-linked bonds rose, with yields falling lower,&quot; said Adam Reuter, managing director of Financial Immunities.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past two weeks the yield curve of the CPI-linked bonds has become negative after being flat. This indicates that the market expects interest rates to go down and that traders are selling short bonds to move into the equities market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Israel's stock market began climbing out of its three-year slump at the end of last year and this month a slew of new issues, most importantly a $150 million offering in Bank Leumi, has attracted an influx of capital.</p>
<p>Adam Reuter said prices of unlinked bonds were unchanged on Thursday ending a move lower that had come in response to the central bank decision on Monday not to cut June interest rates. The base rate is 13.9 percent, a level it has been at since the end of February.</p>
<p>Reuter said prices for dollar-linked bonds were higher because of the strengthening of the dollar.</p>
<p>A trader at one of the banks said there was heavy surplus demand of 212 million shekels for Makams.</p>
<p>&quot;This is probably because traders are expecting lower interest rates in the future and lower inflation in the coming months,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.39 shekels)</p>
