<title>UK: Copper shortage in UK forces up physical premiums.</title>

<p>Physical copper premiums in Britain have edged higher as a shortage of metal has persisted, forcing some customers to pay high fees to import from the continent, traders said.</p>
<p>Premiums for prompt metal have risen to $40/$50 per tonne over London Metal Exchange cash, up from $35/$45 last week and $30/$35 in early March.</p>
<p>&quot;If you want it today, you won't get it,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>There is no registered metal in British LME warehouses. The last 25 tonnes was reported being delivered out on March 24, compared to 4,800 tonnes which was being stored in early February.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand some people had to bring in some metal from Rotterdam or Hamburg, which cost about $50/$55 (over LME cash) including all of the fees. But they had to do it since they had a commitment,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Overall, though, physical copper business was sluggish, traders said.</p>
<p>Premiums in Rotterdam were little changed for Chilean copper at $30/$35 and Good Western at $20/$30.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not much of it around, but then there's not much demand either,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Demand was said to be rather weak in Italy, where premiums were around $25/$35.</p>
<p>A British scrap merchant quoted copper bright wire scrap at $1,400/50 stg per tonne, down about 20 stg from last week as LME futures prices eased.</p>
