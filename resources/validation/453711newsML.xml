<headline>FOCUS - France Telecom share sale set for May.</headline>

<p>The French government will begin the privatisation of France Telecom on May 6 with the sale of shares worth between 30 and 50 billion francs ($5.3 and $8.8 billion), company chairman Michel Bon said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The shares, due to be listed in Paris and New York, will begin trading on June 9, but the government declined to specify how much of its holding would be sold.</p>
<p>The government originally said it expected to raise at least 25 billion francs from the partial privatisation, but a finance ministry official commented the final amount sold would depend on demand with the state retaining at least 50 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;If the good market sentiment is confirmed, this would make the operation by far the biggest in France,&quot; Bon told a news conference. &quot;The previous record was set by the privatisation of Elf.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1994, the government raised 35.7 billion francs with the sale of shares in Elf-Aquitaine, the largest state asset sale at the time.</p>
<p>The France Telecom sale will start with three weeks reserved for private investors and the market float will take place between May 27 and June 3.</p>
<p>France Telecom made a 1996 net consolidated profit of 14.5 billion francs, against 14 billion in 1995. But after special charges, the net attributable profit was 2.1 billion francs.</p>
<p>Bon said the company aimed to stabilise its profits at last year's level before special charges.</p>
<p>Its sales rose to 151.3 billion francs from 147.8 billion in 1995. Operating income climbed to 30.3 billion francs from 29.6 billion.</p>
<p>France Telecom said a special 37.5 billion franc payment to the state for pension charges was taken from the company's capital and not from the 1996 results. It also took a 16.4 billion franc provision for early retirements.</p>
<p>It added there were two non-recurring charges in the 1996 results -- a 26.8 billion franc asset write-down, mainly for property, which was partially compensated by the taking back of 14.5 billion francs in provisions for pensions.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1997, we will pursue and intensify our actions...We expect an acceleration of growth and believe that the number of minutes (of communication) sold will rise by about six percent,&quot; Bon said.</p>
<p>In 1996, France Telecom sold 123 billion minutes of communication time, up 4.7 percent on 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The result of all these movements should allow us to stabilise the result at the record level reached in 1996, before all exceptional elements,&quot; Bon added.</p>
<p>&quot;The strategy of France Telecom in light of the arrival of competition is simple -- it consists of benefiting from the market pressure which will accelerate growth. France Telecom, as market leader, will benefit the most from market growth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Full liberalisation of the French and European telecoms market will start on January 1, 1998, and rivals are already preparing to enter the French market. One is the Cegetel unit of Cie Generale des Eaux with British Telecom Plc and Mannesmann AG.</p>
<p>Another is a venture of Bouygues with Italy's STET.</p>
<p>France Telecom said its total debt stood at 69.9 billion francs at the end of 1996, down 14.3 billion francs.</p>
<p>Bon said 1996 had been a key year for the company's international development with the Global One alliance with Sprint Corp of the U.S. and Deutsche Telekom, as well as with the Mobilstar mobile telecoms network in Belgium.</p>
