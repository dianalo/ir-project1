<p>Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole on Wednesday accused President Bill Clinton of sowing &quot;moral confusion&quot; about drug use and criticised the entertainment industry for glorifying drugs.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Chaminade College Preparatory High School, a Roman Catholic school that uses drug-sniffing dogs to help keep the campus drug-free, Dole also unveiled a new anti-drug slogan -- &quot;Just don't do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Dole was seeking to reignite a public crusade against drug use as well as his own struggling campaign.</p>
<p>Dole took a tumble later in the day while shaking hands at with line of voters before a rally in the northern California city of Chico. A stage railing he was holding onto for support gave way and he fell to the ground, his tumble broken by a group of news photographers. He grimaced as he fell, but quickly got to his feet with some assistance from security personnel.</p>
<p>Dole then immediately began his speech, saying, &quot;I think I just earned my third Purple Heart going over the rail, but you can always say I've fallen for Chico.&quot;</p>
<p>After the incident Dole spokesman Nelson Warfield said there were no plans to seek medical attention even though Dole had &quot;a little bit of blood on his left eye. He might have broken a blood vessel but he feels great.&quot;</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, Dole said Clinton had set the wrong example for American teenagers by making light of his own past, non-inhaling, experimentation with marijuana -- citing an MTV interview in which Clinton said he would inhale the drug marijuana if he had it to do over again.</p>
<p>&quot;Joke or no joke, teenagers may be struggling with the lure of drugs. They have seen a United States president make light of his own experimentation,&quot; Dole said.</p>
<p>&quot;A president is supposed to show the light, and this president has shown his moral confusion. We will never have a firm, confident, national message against drugs when our leaders, any of them, are ambivalent themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>He also renewed criticism of cuts the Clinton administration had made in anti-drugs programmes.</p>
<p>The speech was the latest salvo in Dole's effort to win votes with an anti-drugs, anti-crime programme launched on Monday in Philadelphia. The entertainment and fashion industries shared in the responsibility for shaping attitudes among teenagers, whose rates of drug use have more than doubled since 1992, Dole said.</p>
<p>&quot;Take your influence seriously, you have a lot of it,&quot; he said, addressing the industries. &quot;Respect your talent and power. Stop the commercialization of drug abuse. Stop the glorification of slow suicide.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The marijuana leaf and the heroin needle have become the symbols of fashionable rebellion, and two of the most widely praised movies of the past two years, 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Trainspotting' feature the romance of heroin,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Fashion magazines feature models with what is known as the 'junkie look.' Rock musicians create and celebrate a culture of heroin. And some have become role models, even in death,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dole has seen neither &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, about Scottish heroin addicts living in squalor, or &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, about American heroin addicts living the fast life, Warfield said. But he has read reviews of both films, including one citing &quot;Trainspotting&quot; as a &quot;funny, upbeat look at heroin addiction,&quot; Warfield said.</p>
<p>Dole harkened back to the 1980's anti-drug campaign of former first lady Nancy Reagan, with its slogan &quot;Just say no,&quot; in leading the students in his new slogan, &quot;Just don't do it.&quot; The line also evokes Nike's shoe slogan, &quot;Just do it.&quot;</p>
<p>In Chico, Dole said many people had mocked her slogan, but it worked nonetheless. &quot;I know the liberal media may not like it. We ought to tell them 'Just don't do it.' Just don't do it with some of the stories you write ... write nice stories about Bob Dole.&quot;</p>
