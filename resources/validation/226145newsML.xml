<p>Indonesia's PT Indofood Sukses Makmur, a member of the Salim Group, said on Friday it expected to acquire majority shareholding in its principal distributor Indomarco and several edible oils and fats firms in early 1997.</p>
<p>Indofood said it had appointed an independent adviser and would issue detailed announcements by the end of January.</p>
<p>&quot;With approval of the independent shareholders, these acquisitions are projected to transpire in early 1997, funded by a combination of debt and equity,&quot; Indofood said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said the acquisition of Indomarco, which also belongs to the Salim Group, was expected to strengthen its distribution networks.  </p>
<p>The acquisition of several edible oils and fats firms, also belonging to the Salim Group, was expected to further expand Indofood's consumer brand products and ensure the availability of bulk products for its own use, it said.</p>
<p>It said the proposed acquisitions would have positive impacts on Indofood's financial performance for the coming years.</p>
<p>Indofood said net sales for the nine months ended September 30 jumped 51 percent to 2.1 trillion rupiah over the same period last year.</p>
<p>It said noodle sales accounted for 54 percent of revenues, flour milling 37 percent and the rest came from snack and baby foods.</p>
<p>Indofood said on Thursday it posted a net profit of 258.59 billion rupiah in the first nine months of 1996 against 225.07 billion rupiah in the same period last year.</p>
