<p>Egyptian share prices fell back on Monday in weak trade which was still affected by a new dealing system, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) all-share index lost 0.44 points to close at 234.05 points on low turnover of 17.88 million pounds ($5.26 million).</p>
<p>The market was closed on Sunday for a public holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still nervous because of the new dealing system,&quot; said broker Yasser Rashad of Triple A Securities.</p>
<p>On its first day of trade since listing, newly-privatised East Delta Flour Mills jumped 7.00 pounds to 38.00. The state in late September sold over 60 percent of the miller at 31.00 pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the transactions were on the millers and specially Central and West Delta and Upper Egypt,&quot; Rashad said.</p>
<p>Market favourite Central and West Delta Flour Mills added 2.50 to finish at 52.15 pounds and popular Upper Egypt Flour Mills closed unchanged at 48.00.</p>
<p>Arab Cotton Ginning was the market leader with shares worth 4.05 million pounds changing hands. But shares ended unchanged at 32.00 pounds.</p>
<p>The CMA index for openly traded firms was down at 359.29 from 362.19 points on Thursday while the index for rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms rose to 162.63 points from 162.34.</p>
<p>Decliners outnumbered gainers by 18 to 11.</p>
