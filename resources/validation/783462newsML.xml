<p>Shanghai's foreign currency B shares drifted lower in morning trade on Wednesday as investors turned their attention to the surging Hong Kong stock market and new share issues, brokers said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong stocks continued to flirt with new record highs, diverting buying attention away from the Shanghai market, they said.</p>
<p>The B index fell 0.386 point or 0.52 percent to 74.095 on volume of 11.299 million shares worth $4.515 million.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Hong Kong market is very good right now, so investors aren't interested in B shares,&quot; said an analyst at a Japanese securities firm in Shanghai.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are simply holding good B shares and no one wants to buy the bad ones,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Investors continued to snap up shares of Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery Co Ltd, which listed on Tuesday. Other investors were looking ahead to the new listing of Inner Mongolia Yitai Coal Co Ltd on Friday, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Yitai plans to list 166 million B shares in Shanghai on Friday. The coal producer issued the shares in July at an offer price of 3.377 yuan ($0.4073) per share.</p>
<p>&quot;The new counters, like Zhenhua, are doing okay but no one wants to buy the old issues,&quot; said another analyst at an Asian securities firm in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Zhenhua Port was both the top gainer and the most heavily traded B share on Wednesday morning. It rose $0.038 or 7.92 percent to $0.518 on volume of about 5.7 million shares.</p>
<p>Of 46 B shares, 37 traded in the morning with 19 down, 10 up and 8 flat.  </p>
<p>Shanghai A shares fell in sluggish trade on Wednesday morning, continuing a correction after recent rises, brokers said.</p>
<p>The A index slipped 3.728 points or 0.30 percent to 1,248.138 on volume of 111.858 million shares worth 1.187 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The SSE30 blue chip index edged down 3.304 points or 0.09 percent to 3,744.729.</p>
<p>Brokers said both the A and B share markets were likely to continue to consolidate in afternoon trading on Wednesday.  </p>
