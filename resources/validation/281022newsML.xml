<p>The United States would consider easing trade sanctions and providing more food aid to North Korea now that Pyongyang has apologised for a submarine incursion into South Korea, U.S. officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>The official also told reporters that North Korea has finally agreed to attend a crucial U.S.-South Korean &quot;briefing&quot; on a proposal for Korean peninsula peace talks within the next few weeks.</p>
<p>With Pyongyang's formal apology this weekend to Seoul for September's submarine incursion, &quot;we now believe the potential exists for moving forward&quot; on a broad range of issues, Sandy Kristoff, senior White House expert on Asia, said.</p>
<p>He said these included a 1994 $6 billion nuclear deal, the peace proposal briefing, economic issues between the U.S. and North Korea, and humanitarian assistance concerns that North Korea has raised in the international community.</p>
<p>Another senior official added: &quot;Clearly with the submarine incident behind us and with other positive developments like the acceptance of the joint briefing ... this significantly improves prospects for improving U.S.-North Korean relations.&quot;</p>
<p>A senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters anonymously, said Washington has no plans now to provide additional food aid to North Korea but would consider contributing to an international appeal for such help.</p>
<p>The United Nations World Food Programme is expected to make an official appeal shortly and the United States was expected to offer $6 million. This would be beyond money already contributed by Washington to U.N. appeals to meet the dire foods needs of the Stalinist state.</p>
<p>As for easing trade sanctions on North Korea, the official said the administration was prepared last September to issue, on a case by case basis, &quot;licenses to private companies that might wish to engage (with Pyongyang) in barter trade or other transactions with respect to food.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We now are prepared to consider that again now that the submarine is behind us,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The official did not mention any specific firm but Minneapolis-based Cargill Inc., the world's largest private grain trading company, said on Monday it was awaiting a decision from the U.S. Treasury Department on an application to sell up to 2 million metric tons of grain to North Korea.</p>
<p>The application, submitted in September, &quot;includes a broad authorisation on what constitutes the business and does not specify rice, corn or other commodity. But it would be food,&quot; Cargill spokeswoman Laurie Johnson told Reuters.</p>
<p>The official North Korean news agency KCNA on Monday said the United States had pledged to ease a trade embargo against North Korea and give food aid to the communist state.</p>
<p>The reclusive North Korea has been suffering from famine after two consecutive years of serious flooding.</p>
<p>As for the joint briefing on the U.S.-South Korean peace proposal -- which would bring Seoul and Pyongyang into a direct dialogue -- the official said specific details like venue still must be worked out but &quot;I would expect this to take place within a few weeks at the latest.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young-sam earlier this year invited North Korea and China to take part in talks aimed at securing a lasting peace to replace the truce that ended the Korean War.</p>
<p>The submarine incursion put the peace initiative on ice, froze international food aid to the hungry North and stalled implementation of the 1994 U.S.-North Korea nuclear accord under which Pyongyang pledged to halt its nuclear weapons programme in return for $6 billion in new nuclear power reactors and alternative energy supplies.</p>
<p>Pyongyang's apology was issued on Sunday after U.S. and North Korean officials hammered out acceptable wording during 11 intense negotiating sessions in New York.</p>
<p>On Monday, South Korea returned to Pyongyang the ashes of 24 North Korean submarine intruders in a ceremony intended as a gesture of conciliation by Seoul.</p>
