<p>Volatile Indian stocks are likely to consolidate this week after a surge to 34-month highs met with resistance, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market had almost reached historic peaks and so there was bound to be a reaction. Still, I am bullish and expect the market to bottom out,&quot; Antony Sequeira, managing director at Arcadia Share &amp; Stock Brokers, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I am recommending investors to use the correction as a buying opportunity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange's top 30-share index ended with a net gain of 50.22 points, or 1.15 percent, at 4,397.54 last week after hitting a 34-month high of 4,605.41 -- shy of 4,653.31 all-time high set on September 12, 1994.</p>
<p>Analysts termed the reaction as a &quot;healthy correction&quot; and said the market still had room for upside.</p>
<p>&quot;These reactions are a must for the market. All the weak players have to get out,&quot; said Nand Kishore Gupta, chief executive officer at Ind-Sec Share &amp; Stock Brokers. &quot;The outlook remains good.&quot;</p>
<p>Much of the momemtum for the bull run had come in anticipation of a turnaround in the Indian economy forecast for the third quarter of 1997/98 (April-March), analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rates are coming down, the rupee is holding ground against other currencies and there is a possible turnaround in the second half,&quot; said Jaspreet Ahuja, head of sales at Caspian Research (India) Pvt Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;Given this why wouldn't India look attractive vis-a-vis the other Asian markets? That's the pattern that investors are looking at,&quot; Ahuja said.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors should focus on industries which are likely to benefit from a revival.</p>
<p>&quot;We are saying that you should buy into sectors which will revive in six months,&quot; Jyotivardhan Jaipuria, first vice president at DSP Merrill Lynch, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Buy cement and engineering,&quot; he said. &quot;There'll be bad news over the near term and investors should make use of this opportunity to buy.&quot;</p>
<p>A consensus estimate of analysts polled by Reuters last week showed that Indian steel, cement and car companies may take an earnings hit, but most other sectors should maintain profit growth in the first half of fiscal 1997/98.</p>
<p>Profits are forecast to grow by an average of 10.4 percent in the six months to September 30, compared to 12.2 percent in the year-ago period, the poll report showed.</p>
<p>&quot;... Taking note of a sluggish first quarter, we are revising downward our (financial year ending March 31, 1998) forecast from 10 percent to 8.0 percent,&quot; investment bank Merrill Lynch said in a recent India Economic Monthly report.</p>
<p>But it said industrial growth was expected to pick up later this year on the back of falling interest rates</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that falling interest rates, rising stock market levels, improved agricultural production and tax incentives given in the budget will fuel higher industrial growth rates in the latter half of FY1998,&quot; the report said.</p>
