<headline>SOCCER-VICENZA TOP IN ITALY FOR FIRST TIME IN THEIR HISTORY.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Vicenza are not the most familiar name in Europe but they joined some ellite company on Sunday when they went clear at the top of the Italian League for the first time in their 94-year history.</p>
<p>Elsewhere Newcastle drew with Chelsea but stayed a point clear of the pack in England, while Real Madrid dislodged arch-rivals Barcelona to take over the lead in Spain and Glasgow Rangers clinched what could prove to be the first part of a domestic treble by winning the League Cup in Scotland.</p>
<p>ITALY</p>
<p>Vicenza opened up a one-point lead at the top of Serie A for the first time in their 94-year history on Sunday after defeating Reggiana 2-0 with Gabriele Ambrosetti scoring both goals. They would have lost top spot later on Sunday night if Inter Milan had beaten AC Milan in their derby match at the San Siro but that game ended 1-1, leaving Vicenza on 20 points, one ahead of Bologna who beat Atalanta 3-1, and one ahead of Inter who slipped to third.</p>
<p>SPAIN</p>
<p>Real Madrid replaced Barcelona at the top of the table thanks to a hat-trick by Croatian international Davor Suker in the 4-2 win over Valencia.</p>
<p>With 32 points from 14 games Real go top by one point after Barcelona's 2-1 defeat at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. A further point behind Barcelona are unbeaten Deportivo Coruna, 4-1 winners over struggling Logrones.</p>
<p>It was Real's best performance of the season and showed some real steel as they went behind after 12 only minutes. Teenager Raul sealed the game with a superb goal to make it 4-1 before Valencia pulled one back from the penalty spot in the dying minutes.</p>
<p>Hercules climbed off the bottom by beating Compostela 1-0 in their first win since the opening game of the season.</p>
<p>ENGLAND</p>
<p>Arsenal moved to within a point of leaders Newcastle after beating Tottenham 3-1 in the North London derby on Sunday, with the decisive goals from Tony Adams and Dennis Bergkamp coming in the last two minutes. Arsenal were the only team in the top five to win over the weekend with Newcastle drawing 1-1 with fifth-placed Chelsea on Saturday and Liverpool, who slipped from second to third following Arsenal's win, drawing 1-1 with fourth-placed Wimbledon, also on Saturday.</p>
<p>Champions Manchester United led twice against lowly Middlesbrough on Saturday but had to settle for a 2-2 draw.</p>
<p>GERMANY</p>
<p>VfB Stuttgart, who scored after only 38 seconds, failed to recapture top spot in the Bundesliga when they lost 3-1 at strugglers Duisburg on Sunday. Stuttgart began the weekend as league leaders but lost their place on Saturday when Bayern Munich went top after a 2-1 win over bottom club Hansa Rostock.</p>
<p>Stuttgart slipped to second, level on points with Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen. Dortmund beat Werder Bremen 4-0 on Saturday while Leverkusen lost 3-1 at St Pauli. Meanwhile Fortuna Duesseldorf, lying 15th in the table, sacked Bosnian coach Aleksander Ristic on Sunday following Friday's 2-0 defeat at Karlsruhe.</p>
<p>FRANCE</p>
<p>Monaco moved to within a point of leaders Paris St Germain after they beat Nancy 2-0 at home on Saturday thanks to goals from Nigerian Victor Ikpeba and Scot John Collins. PSG dropped two points on Friday when they were held to a goalless draw at home by Marseille.</p>
<p>But champions Auxerre, who scored an impressive 2-1 win at Ajax in Amsterdam in the Champions League on Wednesday, crashed to a 2-1 home defeat to Bastia, who moved into third place. Auxerre have now gone four domestic matches without a win.</p>
<p>SCOTLAND</p>
<p>England midfielder Paul Gascoigne scored twice in 90 seconds as Rangers beat Hearts 4-3 to win the Scottish League Cup final for the 20th time at Celtic's Parkhead ground on Sunday. Rangers led 2-0 with two goals from Ally McCoist in the first half before Steve Fulton and John Robertson levelled for the Edinburgh side. Gascoigne then killed Hearts off with his goals in the 64th and 66th minutes, before David Weir scored Hearts' third in the last minute. The outcome left Hearts still waiting for their first major trophy for 34 years but was Rangers' 11th trophy in the last five years under manager Walter Smith.</p>
<p>NETHERLANDS</p>
<p>Arch-rivals Feyenoord and Ajax fought out a highly-charged 2-2 draw in the Dutch first division but the match was marred by rival fans fighting in the streets of Rotterdam, Ajax's team coach being stoned, and the kickoff delayed by 15 minutes because of the crowd violence.</p>
<p>Three penalties in the first 15 minutes only added to the tense atmosphere. Ajax's Patrick Kluivert missed a penalty after two minutes, but Ronald Koeman put Feyenoord ahead from the spot two minutes later. After 15 minutes Ronald de Boer scored a penalty for Ajax to make it 1-1, but within a minute Bernard Schuiteman restored Feyenoord's lead. Kluivert gave Ajax a share of the points with a second equaliser midway through the second half.</p>
<p>PORTUGAL</p>
<p>Benfica beat Farense 2-1 on Sunday to join Porto at the top of the table, although Porto could go clear on Monday when they play Maritimo. Benfica won with goals from Brazilian midfielder Valdo Filho, who scored with a first half penalty and a second from Bulgarian midfielder Ilian Iliev after 70 minutes. Sporting, chasing their first title for 14 years, lost ground when they went down 1-0 to Setubal on Saturday.</p>
