<p>A terminally-ill Australian woman has become the second person to commit suicide under the world's first voluntary euthanasia law, declaring &quot;peace at last&quot; as she received a fatal dose of drugs via a computer programme.</p>
<p>Euthanasia campaigners said on Monday that 52-year-old Janet Mills, who was suffering from a rare form of skin cancer which causes the skin to disintegrate, took her life last Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Her last words were 'peace at last' as she used a computer-driven device to self-administer a lethal dose of drugs,&quot; the National Coalition for Voluntary Euthanasia said in a statement on its &quot;Deliverance&quot; Internet site.</p>
<p>The euthanasia law came into operation in the outback Northern Territory in July. In September, 66-year-old cancer patient Bob Dent became the first to use it to die.</p>
<p>But an alliance of church and civic leaders are leading a legal and parliamentary battle to quash the Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act.</p>
<p>A backbench bill to overturn the act passed the lower house of the national parliament last month and is expected to go next month to the upper house Senate, where it faces greater opposition.</p>
<p>The controversy around the law meant that it took several weeks for Mills to find a local cancer specialist to support her after travelling to the Northern Territory from South Australia. In the end she only found one after &quot;begging&quot; for help at an emotional news conference last month.</p>
<p>Mills said she had spent three years battling the disease mycosis fungoides, the rare skin cancer whose best-known victim was British comic actor Paul Eddington, star of the BBC's &quot;Yes, Minister&quot; series. She was frail and thin with lesions covering her face and appeared unable to stop scratching herself.</p>
<p>She died beside her husband and son with euthanasia campaigner Dr Philip Nitschke supervising. Nitschke, who also helped Dent die, refused to comment on her case on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that anyone else wishing to use this Act does not have to go through such a long battle to find a doctor to help them. The whole thing was very hard on me and my family,&quot; Mills said in a a letter written the day before her death.</p>
<p>She added: &quot;I believe that euthanasia is the greatest thing for people who are sick with no chance of getting better. It's a wonderful idea and it stops people from suffering when they don't need to.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope this law survives and is able to help others like me, who have found the suffering has become too great. It should not be overturned by the politicians in Canberra but given a chance to be made to work in the way it was intended.&quot;</p>
<p>Leading euthanasia campaigner Peter Baume, professor of community medicine at the University of New South Wales, said the Northern Territory should now amend its rules so that the medical specialist providing the third signature does not have to live in the Territory.</p>
<p>That requirement is not written into the legislation but was added afterwards through the regulations governing the act and could easily be modified.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone can have their own opinion. What I object to is people trying to force their opinion on others,&quot; Baume told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;They should realise that human beings are mortal anyway, that death is part of life and how we die is very important.&quot;</p>
