<p>A meeting of political parties in Spain's Basque region to show unity against a spate of deadly attacks by separatist rebels has raised hopes of a breakthrough in the conflict, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But while the parties, grouped in a 1988 pact known as Ajuria Enea to seek &quot;pacification and normalisation&quot; of the region, want to speak in one voice, they are deeply divided.</p>
<p>The forum excludes only one of the region's main parties, Herri Batasuna, the political arm of ETA (Basque Homeland of Freedom) which has been blamed by the government in Madrid for four killings in two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;The Lehendekhari (Basque government president) is going to make all the effort in the world to recoup the mood of unity and consensus. For this reason I am very hopeful ahead of the meeting tomorrow,&quot; Basque Interior Minister Juan Maria Atutxa told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.</p>
<p>Speaking at the seat of the regional government in Vitoria, Atutxa conceded Ajuria Enea members disagree on the key issues of whether to negotiate with ETA now and where more than 500 ETA prisoners should be serving out their jail terms.</p>
<p>Even within Atutxa's own Basque National Party (PNV), which heads the regional government, there are deep splits on talks.</p>
<p>At the meeting on Friday, Basque President Jose Antonio Ardanza is expected to reintroduce a conditional offer of dialogue with ETA which the PNV first made last June, two days after the rebels unilaterally declared a one-week truce.</p>
<p>The proposal will almost certainly be rejected by the Basque branch of Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's Popular party and the leading opposition Socialist party.</p>
<p>Although the offer linking dialogue to an end to violence seemed in line with the central government's position, the surge in violence this year has hardened Madrid. Ministers have made it clear the time is not right for any talk of negotiations.</p>
<p>Ardanza, anticipating rejection, will also suggest Ajuria Enea parties start informal talks amongst themselves to reach a consensus on talks with ETA.</p>
<p>&quot;The lack of consensus only gives wings to the violence,&quot; Atutxa said.</p>
<p>ETA has killed some 800 people since starting a drive for independence in 1968.</p>
<p>The meeting has also raised ETA's hopes for movement.</p>
<p>&quot;What happens on Friday in Ajuria Enea may be very important. A different situation for the near future could emerge from there,&quot; spokesman for HB's leadership Joseba Bernach told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Atutxa said Ajuria Enea, the Basque name for the president's residence where the forum meets, has been rendered ineffective in the past few years.</p>
<p>While Basque nationalists have pursued a more conciliatory stance toward HB, the Popular Party was taking a firm line on ETA to draw voters in its electoral campaign last year.</p>
<p>Bernach and others close to ETA said in interviews this week the recent escalation of violence is an expression of frustration at the lack of progress towards negotiations and at what they perceive as a get-tough policy in Madrid.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is betting on repression,&quot; Bernach said.</p>
<p>The politicians and the rebels seem to be locked in a vicious circle. The government won't negotiate until ETA ends violence and ETA says it will only stop once the government recognises the Basque right to self-determination.</p>
