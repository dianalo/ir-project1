<p>BankAmerica Corp chief financial officer Michael O'Neill said the board will meet in early February to consider dividend and repurchase recommendations.</p>
<p>Earlier, BankAmerica said it repurchased 4.7 million shares in the fourth quarter. O'Neill noted the company has $800 million of authority left in the stock repurchase plan.</p>
<p>On a conference call with reporters, O'Neill called the repurchase program a default strategy. &quot;We believe that we can deploy our capital in more shareholder friendly ways than through acquisitions,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>During the conference call, O'Neill also cited a pickup in California loan demand during the fourth quarter, that is expected to continue.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm happy to see we've seen a long-awaited pickup in California loan demand and we think that bodes well for the future,&quot; said O'Neill.</p>
<p>He said 30 percent of BankAmerica's domestic loan growth in the fourth quarter occurred in California, both in consumer and commercial loans. Domestic loans grew about $3.0 billion to $139 billion since the quarter ended September 30.  </p>
<p>In December, BankAmerica announced it would cut 3,700 jobs resulting in fourth quarter restructuring charge in order to cut costs in certain underperforming areas.</p>
<p>O'Neill said BankAmerica continues to study each asset and division. &quot;This process is ongoing and will continue in perpetuity. I suspect there will be actions that will come out but none at this point that will be tangible,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Additionally, O'Neill said BankAmerica has no plans to acquire a brokerage in California or elsewhere at this point.</p>
<p>Several analysts have said BankAmerica has indicated an interest  in making such an acquisition.  </p>
<p>Earlier, BankAmerica reported fourth quarter income rose to $1.93 per share to $1.74 per share.</p>
<p>Net income rose to $747 million from $704 million.</p>
<p>The earnings topped First Call mean estimate of $1.90 a share.</p>
<p>BankAmerica's shares rose 2 to 103-3/4.</p>
