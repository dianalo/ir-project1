<p>The New Zealand dollar closed a touch weaker on Thursday as sell-offs in the bond and share markets flowed through into the currency.</p>
<p>The Kiwi finished at US$0.6930/37 and 68.22 on its Trade-Weighted Index, from 0.6936/41 and 68.47 at the opening.</p>
<p>&quot;The bond market, the equities market, they've all come in for a bit of selling pressure and clearly some of that's flowing through into the currency as well,&quot; said Phillip Lindberg at Bankers Trust.  </p>
<p>Bond market weakness was exacerbated by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan voicing concern about the risk of higher inflation, while the equities market was reacting mainly to disappointing earnings reports.</p>
<p>Dealers said some early exporter buying of the Kiwi was checked by U.S. selling as the currency moved in a narrow 0.6932-45 range on the day, with little reaction to government fiscal figures and January merchandise trade data.  </p>
<p>Bankers Trust economists said the NZ$134 monthly trade deficit was well below expectations and consistent with the view of a reasonable external sector performance and stable current account deficit this year. They called the data mildly positive for the currency and bonds.</p>
<p>A Wellington dealers said there were bids for the New Zealand dollar around 0.6925-30 and he saw it in a 0.6930-60 range. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746</p>
