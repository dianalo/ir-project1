<p>The founder of defunct New Zealand airline Kiwi International, Ewan Wilson, said on Monday he was seeking government legislation to protect start-up carriers in niche markets.</p>
<p>He said as an example, the legislation could protect a carrier which wanted to fly between Wagga Wagga in south-eastern New South Wales and Invercargill on the southern tip of New Zealand's south island.</p>
<p>&quot;We would in fact reduce the barriers of entry by making it possible for new start-up carriers with a less amount of capital to pioneer new routes,&quot; Wilson told an aviation conference.  </p>
<p>Wilson said the introduction of this legislation would prompt him to try again with the formation of a second Kiwi International airline.</p>
<p>&quot;I have spoken to a member of parliament and we've had a discussion and we'll continue to have discussions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think once December 10 comes along and we have a coalition government then we'll be able to speed up that process.&quot;</p>
<p>New Zealand Labour Party deputy leader Michael Cullen said earlier this month he expected the next NZ government to be formed by December 10.  </p>
<p>New Zealand First Party leader Winston Peters, who holds the balance of power, also said he expected the new government to be formed within the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Wilson's Hamilton-based airline went into liquidation on September 10 with liquidators saying that its creditors were unlikely to recover anything.</p>
<p>Wilson has previously attributed the collapse to severe competition, mechanical faults and flight disruptions from the eruption of Mount Ruapehu in the North Island of New Zealand.</p>
