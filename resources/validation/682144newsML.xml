<title>USA: Strong U.S. drug stocks recovery keyed by upgrade.</title>
<headline>Strong U.S. drug stocks recovery keyed by upgrade.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Set in motion by a key investment rating upgrade, major U.S. drug stocks on Tuesday surged ahead of a broadly rising stock market.</p>
<p>After leading a downside plunge on Monday, blue-chip drug issues charged back in late Tuesday trading.</p>
<p>&quot;What you're seeing in general in the group is a recovery from yesterday,&quot; said Merrill Lynch drug industry analyst Steve Tighe, whose upgrade of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co to long-term buy from long-term accumulate was credited by some traders as sparking the drug sector stampede.</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers shares were up 8-1/8 to 84-1/2. Among other top drug stocks, Pfizer Inc was up 5-1/4 to 116-1/4; Eli Lilly and Co was up 4-13/16 to 110-13/16; Merck &amp; Co Inc was up 4-1/2 to 103-1/8; Warner-Lambert Co was up 4-7/16 to 119-9/16  -- price swings of a sort seldom seen in the sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The drug stocks are acting like the tech stocks today,&quot; said Gruntal &amp; Co drug industry analyst David Saks.  </p>
<p>Institutional investors likely were pouring capital into Big Pharma, as the sector is known, ahead of anticipated strong second-quarter earnings reports and in line with general market bullishness on large-cap stocks, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Drug group fundamentals are exceptionally strong right now. It's the Dow stocks and the big index stocks that are doing well,&quot; said Alex. Brown drugs analyst Barbara Ryan.</p>
<p>&quot;Coming into the end of the quarter, if people don't own them, they're going to look a little silly ... Some of this is a little bit of window-dressing for the end of the quarter,&quot; Ryan said.  </p>
<p>The move marked a sharp reversal from Monday, when drug issues were among the hardest hit in a blue chip sell-off that saw the Dow Jones industrial average post its biggest percentage-point decline in almost a year.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of this is a rebound off yesterday's decline,&quot; said drugs analyst Samuel Isaly, of Mehta &amp; Isaly.</p>
