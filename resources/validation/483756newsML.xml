<headline>TENNIS-BJORKMANN WINS LATE CALL BY SWEDEN.</headline>
<dateline>STOCKHOLM 1997-04-03</dateline>

<p>Sweden suffered a setback on Thursday ahead of their Davis Cup quarter-final with South Africa when Magnus Larsson withdrew from their team due to a foot injury.</p>
<p>Jonas Bjorkman, who missed Sweden's first round victory over Switzerland, was named as Larsson's replacement in the singles which start on Friday. Bjorkman will also pair up with Nicklas Kulti in the doubles.</p>
<p>Larsson, ranked 41 in the world, hurt his foot during the Lipton Championships in Florida last week.</p>
<p>Thomas Enqvist, who is currently ranked seven in the world and has won one title this year, will be Sweden's other singles player.</p>
<p>Sweden, last year's losing finalists, start favourites for the tie against a team who depend heavily on world number 10 Wayne Ferreira. Grant Stafford, ranked 69, is South Africa's other singles player.</p>
<p>Bjorkman will be hoping for a big improvement against Ferreira in their sixth meeting. He has yet to beat the South African.</p>
<p>&quot;But sometime it will be my turn,&quot; Bjorkman said at the venue for the tie in Vaxjo, southern Sweden.</p>
<p>Bjorkman, world ranked 23, said he was currently playing the best tennis of his career.</p>
<p>So far this year he has won the Auckland title and reached the semifinals at the Champions Cup in Indian Wells, Arizona Classic and St Jude's tournament in Memphis and the quarter-finals at Lipton and the Australian hardcourt championship.</p>
<p>Enqvist will play Stafford and Bjorkman takes on Ferreira on Friday, before Saturday's doubles clash between Bjorkman and Kulti and David Adams and Ellis Ferreira. The reverse singles will be played on Sunday.</p>
