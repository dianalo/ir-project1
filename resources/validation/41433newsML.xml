<title>USA: CSCE coffee ends near lows on spec liquidation.</title>
<headline>CSCE coffee ends near lows on spec liquidation.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-09</dateline>

<p>CSCE coffee prices ended weaker and just above intraday lows Monday, hurt by a late-session bout of speculative liquidation, market sources said.</p>
<p>In what was mainly an uneventful trading day, arabica prices drifted in negative territory from the opening bell.</p>
<p>Light selling by day traders held the market a notch below unchanged for most of the session, but disappointment over December's failure to carve out fresh upside territory inspired a swift round of speculative selling ahead of the close.</p>
<p>Most-active December briefly dipped below chart support at 111.00 cents a lb, touching a low of 110.80, before snapping back by the close. December closed down 1.70 at 111.20, while spot September slumped 2.10 to 122.50.</p>
<p>Traders said today's weaker settlement could signal a return to December's recent low of 108 cents. But most were reluctant to read much into today's session, noting the day's light volume of 4,034 lots.</p>
<p>&quot;I think everyone is taking a breather from last week,&quot; said one trader. &quot;A lot of people went home long on Friday, but everyone just bailed out on the opening.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said tonight's certified stock data would likely show a modest change on the week, but most doubted the numbers would have a broad impact on prices.</p>
<p>Dealers also shrugged off talk of delays in Colombian coffe exports due to trucker protests and guerrilla attacks.</p>
<p>&quot;No one seems to be overly concerned,&quot; the trader said. &quot;I think the reaction by the market says it all.&quot;</p>
