<p>&quot;There were some inquiries from China for prompt SMR 20 rubber. We are offering them (the Chinese buyers) at 252 cents,&quot; a dealer at a trading firm said. &quot;We are still negotiating and business will be known later.&quot;</p>
<p>Otherwise trading was slow on lack of other Asian inquiries. &quot;We don't expect much activity from Europe later today as most Europeans have already met their requirements for the summer vacation,&quot; the dealer added.  </p>
<p>Local dealers are seen covering for sheet and SMR grades, traders said, adding that consumers are also looking to buy forwards right until December positions.</p>
<p>However, producers are unwilling to sell in anticpation of higher prices in the later part of the year when the wet season could led to a supply shortage.</p>
<p>Dealers offered SMR CV at 322 cents, SMR L at 302, SMR 5 at 264, SMR 10 and latex at 219 cents.</p>
<p>At midday, July RSS Ones buyer eased a cent to 275 cents ($1.09) a kg and July SMR 20 buyer was unchanged at 253.50.</p>
