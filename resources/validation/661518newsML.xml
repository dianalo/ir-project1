<p>The appointment of Irish President Mary Robinson as the new U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has been welcomed by major rights groups anxious to see a high-profile personality in the post.</p>
<p>The New York-based Human Rights Watch, which had quietly supported Robinson for weeks, said it had hoped U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan would appoint someone prepared to take principled public positions, according to Joanna Wechsler, its U.N. representative.</p>
<p>And Amnesty International, in a statement, welcomed the choice, saying &quot;Mary Robinson should seize the opportunity to make human rights a cornerstone of the U.N.'s work for the next millennium.&quot;</p>
<p>Annan on Thursday announced he had appointed Robinson because she was an &quot;extraordinary leader&quot; who would bring &quot;dynamism to the job.&quot; He called his decision &quot;one of the most important appointments that I will probably have the opportunity of making during my term.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he had asked her to step down from the Irish presidency by September so she could begin the job at the beginning of the 52nd General Assembly session.</p>
<p>Annan's comments indicated she would leave the presidency before her seven-year term expires on Dec. 2. &quot;I believe Mrs Robinson understands the urgency and the need to start as soon as she can,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Robinson, 53, a lawyer and human rights legal expert, was the first woman elected president of Ireland. She turned  a largely ceremonial post into a focus for injustices in the world and advocated liberalizing Ireland's strict divorce and abortion laws.</p>
<p>In Dublin, Robinson issued a statement saying she appreciated &quot;the trust and confidence which the secretary-general has placed in me.&quot;</p>
<p>The job became vacant after Jose Ayala Lasso resigned in March as the first U.N. human rights commissioner to become Ecuador's foreign minister.</p>
<p>A low-keyed diplomat, he was appointed in 1994 for a four year term with the support of Third World nations, some of whom object to a European candidate like Robinson..</p>
<p>Annan said he would name a deputy shortly from a Third World country. The 165-member General Assembly must endorse Annan's selection of Robinson.</p>
<p>Latin American states preferred Sonia Picado, Costa Rica's ambassador to Washington, as his replacement. She indicated to reporters last month, after hearing from Annan that she would not get the top rights post, that she had been offered the deputy job but probably would not accept it.</p>
