<title>BELGIUM: Independent makers of car spare parts seen at risk.</title>

<p>An industry lobby group warned on Thursday that the survivial of thousands of car spare parts and repair businesses would be threatened if they could not compete with car makers in supplying spare car body parts.</p>
<p>In addition, it said, the European Union's 180 million vehicle owners could expect sharply increased costs.</p>
<p>The European Campaign for the Freedom of the Automotive Parts &amp; Repair Market (ECAR) issued a statement ahead of next Thursday's Internal Market Council which is expected to adopt a common position on the directive for the harmonisation of industrial design law.</p>
<p>At the Council last November, the Commission's drive to force large car manufacturers to allow smaller ones to copy their spare parts gained a reprieve.</p>
<p>The Irish presidency was unable to secure unanimity for its plan for a common position which would rub out the so-called &quot;repairs clause&quot; of the directive and continue the current system used to protect industrial designs and models rather than introduce harmonisation at EU level.</p>
<p>Unanimity was needed as an exclusion of the clause went against the Commission's proposal.</p>
<p>By allowing smaller manufacturers to copy, under licence and for a reasonable and equitable fee, spare parts, the Commission believes that more competition and investment will be promoted.</p>
<p>Under the Commission's amended proposal car spare parts which were not visible, such as oil filters and fan belts, could be freely reproduced.</p>
<p>However, EU diplomats predicted on Thursday that there would be unanimity at the Council on March 13 in removing the repairs clause.</p>
<p>&quot;The Council of Ministers is proposing to delete the repairs clause in favour of a free-for-all provision which would allow member states to give free reign to a 25-year monopoly for EU car makers in the supply of spare car body parts to consumers,&quot; ECAR said.</p>
<p>It said it was fighting to preserve the Commission's amended proposal with the repairs clause, which it said would allow parts makers to continue to produce and supply spare parts to consumers in competition with car makers according to existing practice in all member states, except France.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Council adopts the free-for-all provision, this will lead to confrontation with the European Parliament and to subsequent negotiations in the conciliation committee,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>ECAR represents European consumers, motor insurers, small and medium-sized firms, spare parts makers, independent distributors of spare parts, glass intallers and others.</p>
