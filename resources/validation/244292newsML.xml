<p>Istanbul shares shed an average 0.52 percent in thin, quiet trading on Monday, but ended above the day's lows, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB-100 closed at 93,917.28, down 489.94 points from Friday's all-time high of 94,407.22. It sank to a low of 92,707 before rebounding.</p>
<p>Trade volume dived to 12.20 trillion lira from 17.68 trillion lira on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Sellers take to the sidelines when prices fall, that is why volume shrank,&quot; said Hakan Demirbulak from Tatbank.</p>
<p>Several brokers said the uptrend remained intact although trade range was squeezed after the recent gains. The index leapt 2.89 percent last week after a 5.49 percent surge the previous week and hit nine record closes in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no strong selling because the uptrend is still valid. The market takes a rest by lowering volume,&quot; said Ali Guler from Acar securities.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a need for new locomotive shares other than the state owned firms which recently rallied on privatisation expectations,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Of the 231 shares traded, losers outdid gainers by 104 to 65 and 62 were unchanged. The 85-share industrial index eased 0.29 percent to 98,727.20 and the 15-share financial index fell 1.01 percent to 91,910.47.</p>
<p>Actives were led by largely state owned flat steel producer Eregli and T.Isbank's C series, both steady at 13,250 and 17,750 lira, respectively and utility Aktas Elektrik, up 3,000 lira at 87,000. Together, they made up 17 percent of the total volume.</p>
