<p>Hungary has improved its record in terms of external balances, although the economy's overall performance in 1996 does not give reason for complacency, Finance Minister Peter Medgyessy said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not really satisfied with the overall performance of the economy, although I understand why it was not that strong as we would have liked it to be, but our indicators are very favourable on the area of balance,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Last year's policies aimed to continue the stabilisation programme launched by former finance minister Lajos Bokros in March 1995, the consolidation of results achieved and the improvement of external balances, Medgyessy said.</p>
<p>&quot;The performance of the economy reflects the adjustment phase the Hungarian economy has experienced recently,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>According to finance ministry estimates, gross domestic product (GDP) was flat in 1996 while for 1997 an around two percent growth is predicted.</p>
<p>However, Hungary's industry showed an about three percent real growth in 1996, Medgyessy said, adding &quot;industrial production revived in the last months of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>After a very weak first year half for investment, the third quarter showed some improvement, but overall the January-September investment figures were still 7.5 percent below the previous year's data, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, we see 1996 investments remaining at the levels of 1995 figures,&quot; Medgyessy said.</p>
<p>Foreign trade deficit is seen around $2.5 billion as a result of exports totalling $16 billion to $16.5 billion and imports of $18.5 billion to $18.7 billion, he said.</p>
<p>The current account deficit is seen amounting to some $1.5 billion in 1996, below the planned $2 billion deficit and below the 1995 deficit of $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>Capital inflow remains strong.</p>
<p>&quot;Capital inflow is continuing with the size of inflow substantially surpassing the deficit of the current account,&quot; Medgyessy said, adding that the country's foreign debt also fell.</p>
<p>Hungary's net debt in 1996 was roughly equal to the year's exports, while in 1994 the debt was 1.8 times the exports that year, he said.</p>
<p>The central budget is expected to close the year with a deficit of 130 billion forints, well below the 233 billion forints target set in the budget law.</p>
<p>Hungary has trimmed inflation which was 19.8 percent year-on-year in December, compared to 29.2 percent year-on-year last January, although it was still high, the minister said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this (19.8 percent) is already a result, but not a success yet,&quot; Medgyessy said, adding &quot;this is still extraordinarily high.&quot; Average inflation will be somewhat above 23 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;To reduce inflation by around an annual five percent is a realistic target,&quot; Medgyessy said.</p>
