<p>Glenn McGrath, latest in the distinguished line of great Australian fast bowlers, took a record eight for 38 on Saturday as Australia fought to recapture lost time on the third day of the second test against England at Lord's.</p>
<p>On a day of sunshine and showers, in which play was interrupted five times for rain, England succumbed for only 77 in their first innings, their lowest score in an Ashes match at cricket's headquarters this century.</p>
<p>In reply, Australia were 131 for two at the close with time still to level the six-test Ashes series if the rain holds off for the final two days.</p>
<p>Thursday's opening day was washed out and only 92 minutes play was possible on Friday.</p>
<p>McGrath's figures were superior to the previous best in an Ashes' match at Lord's, Hedley Verity's eight for 43 for England in 1934, and the sixth best in Ashes' history.</p>
<p>He bowled with pace, movement both ways off the seam and a rigorous off-stump line and took ruthless advantage of inconsistent bounce on the relaid pitch and tentative England batting.</p>
<p>&quot;I was just concentrating on bowling a good line and length on the off-stump or just outside,&quot; he explained later.</p>
<p>&quot;I think of myself as more a seam bowler than a swing bowler.&quot;</p>
<p>England coach David Lloyd said McGrath had bowled &quot;exceptionally well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was a Glenn McGrath show,&quot; Lloyd said.</p>
<p>The wiry New South Welshman, who took all three wickets to fall on Friday, dismissed John Crawley (one), Nasser Hussain (19 ), Robert Croft (two), Darren Gough (10) and Andrew Caddick (one ), bowling unchanged from the Pavilion end.</p>
<p>He was given whole-hearted support by Paul Reiffel, who took the other two wickets and obtained sharp movement off the seam down the slope from the Nursery end.</p>
<p>Darren Gough soon gave the spectators something to cheer about when Australian captain Mark Taylor dragged a full length delivery on to his middle stump after scoring only one.</p>
<p>England, without wicketkeeper Alec Stewart who had suffered a back spasm, hustled on to the attack but Elliott showed a broad bat and Greg Blewett drove sweetly through the covers before he was caught at slip for 45 first ball after the final rain break.</p>
<p>The home side's cause was not helped by two dropped catches in consecutive overs. Andrew Caddick fed Elliott's fondness for the hook, only to stare in disbelief as Devon Malcolm dropped a straightforward chance at square-leg.</p>
<p>In the next over from off-spinner Robert Croft, Nasser Hussain got his hands to a mishit cut from Mark Waugh but could not hold the chance.</p>
<p>Gough also missed an opportunity to run out Waugh while Mark Butcher, who had a miserable day in the field, dropped Elliott at second slip shortly before bad light stopped play.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a day of lost opportunities,&quot; Lloyd reflected. &quot;There's a lot of work to do over the next two days.&quot;</p>
<p>Elliott, meanwhile, was unruffled by his two escapes and some mishit hook shots, driving fluently to reach his second 50 of the series with eight boundaries from 115 deliveries.</p>
<p>At the close he was on 55 with Waugh unbeaten on 26.</p>
