<p>Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who angered the upper house of parliament last week by ignoring a plea to address it, held out an olive branch on Monday, Itar-Tass news agency said.</p>
<p>Tass quoted a government spokesman as saying Chernomyrdin had told a delegation from the upper house, the Federation Council, that he was now prepared to come to discuss the country's economic problems.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin, saying he was ill, ignored a request by the Federation Council to address a session last Wednesday to explain the government's failure to pay months of back wages owed to workers in the public sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister expressed his readiness at the meeting to visit the Federation Council to discuss the situation in the social sphere with the deputies of this chamber of parliament,&quot; Tass said.</p>
<p>It said it was not clear whether this meant Chernomyrdin would attend a special Fderation Council session scheduled for Tuesday to discuss his record.</p>
<p>The Federation Council has traditionally been compliant to the demands of President Boris Yeltsin and his government, but Chernomyrdin's failure to show up last Wednesday earned the wrath of some members of the chamber.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin defended the cornerstones of his government's eocnomic policy last Friday in the opposition-dominated State Duma, the lower house, but said some corrections were needed. He did not identify them.</p>
<p>The government's failure to pay wages and pensions has provoked a coalminers' strike and prompted sporadic protests in various parts of the country.</p>
