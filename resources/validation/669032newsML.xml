<p>Sheridan Healthcare Inc, a physician practice management company, said Wednesday it was comfortable with analysts' estimates calling for earnings of $0.15 a share in the second quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now, we are comfortable with the $0.15 earnings estimate that most analysts have,&quot; chief operating officer Michael Schundler said following a presentation at the Piper Jaffray investment conference here.  </p>
<p>The Hollywood, Florida-based company reported earnings of $0.10 a share in the 1996 second quarter.</p>
<p>Schundler expressed concern regarding the higher end of analysts estimates for all of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;I think most of the analysts now have us between $0.60 and $0.63,&quot; he said. &quot;The concern I have with the higher estimates is that they are dependant upon timely acquisitions and acquisitions are not something I can necessarily control. But I'm not uncomfortable with those higher numbers.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1996, the company reported earnings of $0.44 for the full year.</p>
<p>Schundler said the company's top priority is the acquisition of obstetrics practices, followed by interest in hospital-based neonatology and anesthesia contracts or acquisitions.</p>
<p>When the company sells its five primary care practices in which it shares financial risk, it will have 16 remaining practices evenly distributed between obstetrics/gynecology and primary fee-for service clinics. In those 16 practices, Sheridan does not share the financial risk, but collects a fee for each service.</p>
<p>Sheridan shares were unchanged at 11 Wednesday.</p>
