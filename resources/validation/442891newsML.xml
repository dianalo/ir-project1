<headline>Albright, Primakov to attend journalists' show.</headline>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has decided to give Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov a taste of Washington social life at its wackiest, inviting him to the Gridiron dinner, the State Department said on Friday.</p>
<p>The dinner is held annually by an exclusive club of journalists who put on a singing and dancing show that pokes fun at the people, institutions and issues that comprise official Washington. The president usually attends, as well as other top government officials.</p>
<p>Primakov is due to arrive in Washington on Saturday afternoon and hold about four hours of talks with Albright and other top officials on key unresolved issues that will be the centrepiece of next week's summit in Helsinki between President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>The Gridiron dinner will be held on Saturday night and Primakov will be seated at the headtable, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a departure from normal protocol, and the secretary has chosen to invite him because Minister Primakov was very kind to her during her visit to Moscow&quot; two weeks ago, Burns said.</p>
<p>Primakov is to hold talks with Defence Secretary William Cohen on Sunday. He was to meet Clinton at the White House on Monday but officials said that is now unlikely because of a leg injury that required Clinton to have surgery on Friday.</p>
