<p>Greece's interbank depo and forward curves were down and flat in late trade, buying interest for non-taxable FRNs drove their discount margins a few ticks lower and ecu/drachma was easier in its tight range, dealers said.</p>
<p>Sales of 12-month T-bills and two-year zeros hitting the market today did not cover expiries, dealers said.</p>
<p>Ecu/drachma was locked in familiar ranges, currently trading around 309.40/45.</p>
<p>&quot;Depos and forex forwards have collapsed,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank. &quot;Depos are hovering around 10.75 percent and implied drachma rates from forex forwards around 10.20/25 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>London-based investors chose to swap their drachmas for forex driving rates lower, he said.</p>
<p>Fixed coupon bonds were steady but buying interest for non-taxable seven-year floaters pushed their discount margins down to 75 basis points from 78 earlier, a bond dealer at a private bank said.</p>
<p>Early indications pointed to sales of 12-month T-bills and two-year zeros falling short of expiries. About 200 billion drachmas of 12-month T-bills expire today.</p>
<p>Greece issued 12-month T-bills and two-year zeros at a gross rate of 9.60 percent and 9.50 percent respectively today.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 157.32/42 from Tuesday's 157.370 fix, the dollar at 274.52/62 drachmas from 274.700 and the ecu at 309.17/27 from 309.31 drachmas.</p>
<p>&quot;Ecu/drachma is trading close to the lower end of its 309.20/45 range,&quot; said a senior dealer at a foreign bank. &quot;It has eased on thin ecu selling and this makes me believe that a trend reversal could be in the offing.&quot;</p>
<p>Many players run short ecu/drachma positions and it suits them to keep the exchange rate low, the dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said mark was very weak against EMS currencies and the drachma lately and this could also be reversed.</p>
<p>&quot;EMU-related fears have weakened the mark but mark/drachma is too low at current levels. This could explain why New York-based investors have come out and buy it,&quot; said a senior dealer at a private bank.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece  quoted the following late rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at 9.90-10.40</p>
<p>** T/N at 10.00-10.50</p>
<p>** S/N at 10.10-10.60</p>
<p>** One week at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** Two weeks at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** Three weeks at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** One month at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** Two months at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** Three months at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** Six months at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** Nine months at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** Twelve months at 10.30-10.80</p>
