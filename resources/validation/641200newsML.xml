<p>Andy Madadian believes he would have joined the ranks of pop music sensations like Sting and George Michael -- if only he had been at the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>But Madadian was in the wrong place at the wrong time -- he formed a rock band in his native Iran shortly before the 1978 Islamic revolution. One day he was performing for his country's hip westernized youth, foreign dignitaries and the Shah himself. The next he was fleeing a new regime that viewed his light dance music as the work of the devil.</p>
<p>Today Madadian is exiled in Los Angeles, enjoying moderate success selling Farsi-language recordings to the Iranian diaspora around the world and lamenting what might have been.</p>
<p>&quot;You only get once in your lifetime that moment of stardom and for me it happens to be at the time of the Islamic Revolution,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview. &quot;It was bad luck. If I was in Iran today I'd be a billionaire.&quot;</p>
<p>Even with that bad luck, Madadian consistently sells out concerts in Europe, Africa and the Middle East and in Los Angeles, the largest Iranian community in the United States.</p>
<p>NO. 1 IN UZBEKISTAN</p>
<p>His latest album is No. 1 on the charts in Uzbekistan. But his biggest audience by far is in Iran where, he says, copies of his contraband albums are a hot item on the black market.</p>
<p>Therein lies the source of his nagging regret. Since his music is banned in Iran, he does not see a penny of proceeds from sales of his bootlegged records there, which his sources inside the country assure him number in the millions.</p>
<p>&quot;Financially it's very tough. ... I don't get any money from Iran.&quot;</p>
<p>Even as young Iranians risk jail to get their hands on black market records and fleshy videos that are smuggled into the country, Madadian ekes out a humble living, taking doggy bags home from restaurants to a modest condominium. His long, unruly hair gives him the appearance of an artist, but his paunch and sad face reveal a man battered by the disappointment of unfulfilled dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;In Iran you walk the streets and somebody will tell you, 'I have Andy's new album,'&quot; he said. &quot;It's exactly like drugs, it's illegal. One girl was expelled from school for carrying my tapes and she had to write an affidavit that she would never carry it again. My music makes people dance and (the Iranian authorities) don't like it. Especially music that makes girls dance, and maybe show off some leg.&quot;</p>
<p>MUSIC TAME BY WESTERN STANDARDS</p>
<p>By Western standards, Madadian's work is relatively tame: romantic songs of love played to a tune that is an odd combination of upbeat Western pop and exotic Arabic melodies.</p>
<p>&quot;Your body is sculpted like a marble vase, your hair looks like a horse's mane,&quot; he offered as a translation of one of his love songs. &quot;I don't know if that translates in English, but Arabian horses are very beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>Years ago in Iran, Madadian was a more conventional Western-style rock star, drawing on the influence of Rod Stewart, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, which were broadcast over Voice of America.</p>
<p>&quot;In Iran, I only did music in English. I was a rebel,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I sang for Jimmy Carter when he came to tell the Shah to leave. They used to call me young Rod Stewart.&quot;</p>
<p>Since his exile, he has tried on many different identities and achieved enough mainstream prominence at one point to be managed by Michael Jackson's father. About 10 years ago, he crossed over to Farsi in an effort to tap into the exile community, and in 1994 he was named Persian Male Pop Singer of the Decade, an honour for which the competition was light. Now, his publicist dubs him an &quot;Iranian Bon Jovi.&quot;</p>
<p>But always, the thrill of the success he has had is tainted by the frustration of what he has missed out on.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a dream to sing with any one of my favourite singers. George Michael is great. Sting is a phenomenon. But they wouldn't even talk to me,&quot; he said with resignation.</p>
<p>&quot;They would if I was in Iran,&quot; he added after a moment of reflection, &quot;because then I would be richer than they are.&quot;</p>
