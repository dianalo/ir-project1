<p>Sri Lanka's navy has seized a boat carrying 110 Tamil refugees trying to flee to neighbouring India, a navy spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A navy gunboat intercepted the boat on Monday night off Mannar island, 240 km (150 miles) north of Colombo and escorted it back to Mannar, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The frequency of the flow of refugees appears to be increasing,&quot; he said. &quot;The terrorists are encouraging people to leave saying there could be problems in Mannar.&quot;</p>
<p>The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in predominantly Sinhalese Sri Lanka, said a boat with 110 refugees capsized in the same area on the same day.</p>
<p>Rebel radio monitored by Reuters said 14 people, including eight children, drowned. The others were saved by other boats, it said.</p>
<p>The navy spokesman said he had no information on the rebel claim. The navy has detained almost 300 refugees trying to flee to India this month, he added.</p>
<p>Rebels charged each refugee 4,000 to 6,000 rupees ($70-$105) for the ride across the 35 km (20 mile) Palk Strait between Mannar and India's southern state of Tamil Nadu, he said.</p>
<p>Indian authorities have said more than 2,500 refugees have made the crossing since July after the army went on the offensive against the rebels in north Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>With more than 50 million Tamil-speaking people, Tamil Nadu has provided a sanctuary for both Tamil refugees and rebels from Sri Lanka since the ethinic war started in 1983.</p>
<p>Some 200,000 refugees landed in Tamil Nadu in the 1980s. Many are still in camps.</p>
<p>But sympathy for the rebels soured after the 1991 murder of former Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi by a suspected LTTE female suicide bomber during an election campaign in the state.</p>
