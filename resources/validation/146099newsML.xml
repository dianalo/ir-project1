<p>The Polish money market, long plagued by excess liquidity, could become short of cash next year if currency reserves and credit growth are in line with forecasts, a senior central banker said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Jerzy Stopyra, the head of the National Bank of Poland's (NBP) monetary policy department, told reporters during a weekend seminar that the tightening of the money market could make room for a cut in reserves that banks are required to keep.</p>
<p>&quot;Next year there might be first signs of the market turning from an overliquid one into one that searches for cash. This would form the basis for a consideration of a cut in the level of obligatory reserves,&quot; Stopyra said.</p>
<p>He said the main source of excess liquidity in the banking system in 1995 and early this year was the fast growth of foreign currency reserves.</p>
<p>Stopyra said in 1997 net foreign reserves, those held by the whole banking system, were expected to rise only about $300 million. @</p>
<p>In nine months of this year the reserves grew by $1.1 billion to $21.6 billion after a $9 billion growth in 1995.</p>
<p>Deputy NBP President Witold Kozinski, also present, said robust credit growth this year was also fuelling monetary expansion.</p>
<p>But the central bank forecasts credit growth to slow next year to between 8.4 percent and 10.5 percent in real terms from this year's forecast of about 15 percent real growth.</p>
<p>Stopyra also said the bank was likely to begin outright sales of its bills next year with overnight value date.</p>
<p>It now does such operations with a tomorrow/next value date.</p>
<p>&quot;That would allow the NBP to drain the market through outright sales even several times a day,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also said that the NBP would act to bring money market rates, now at an average of about 19.5 percent and the NBP's lombard rate, now at 25 percent, closer to each other.</p>
<p>&quot;We want our reference rate to be the lombard rate,&quot; Stopyra said. He indicated that both the lombard and the market rates were likely to move.</p>
<p>Stopyra said the central bank's task could be made easier by the increased budget deficit financing in the banking sector, which he said was bad in the longer term but would likely lift money market rates in line with T-bill yields next year.</p>
<p>The 1997 budget draft assumes that the share of commercial banks in the financing of the deficit will double.</p>
