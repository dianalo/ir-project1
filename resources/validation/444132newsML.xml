<headline>RTRS-Macquarie Bank sees higher zinc prices.</headline>

<p>Zinc prices should average 56 US cents a pound or higher this year and 65 cents in 1998, Macquarie Bank Ltd analyst Jim Lennon said on Friday.</p>
<p>The forecasts were based on expectation of growth in consumption of zinc of around two to three percent a year and the influence of hedge funds in the marketplace, Lennon told a Macquarie Bank symposium on the zinc industry.</p>
<p>Zinc in 1996 averaged 46 cents a pound. It ended Lonon Metal Exchange afternoon trading Thursday at 58 cents a pound, near a four-and-a-half-year high.</p>
<p>&quot;We've liked zinc for a year now,&quot; Lennon said.  </p>
<p>Lennon said zinc stocks were finally declining as a period of industry destocking winds down, placing upward pressure on the price.</p>
<p>The key stocks-to-consumption ratio of zinc was currently around 6.5 weeks and heading down toward a &quot;critical level&quot; by mid-year, Lennon said.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't quite reached that critical level yet,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However, by the end of the year, the ratio would have slipped to an average of 5.2 weeks, Lennon said.</p>
<p>In 1998, the average would fall further to 3.8 weeks, he said.  </p>
<p>On the supply side, he said there was little to suggest so far that the Anvil Range Mining Corp was in a hurry to restart it Faro zinc mine in Canada.</p>
<p>The mine was idled on December 20 due to poor market conditions, a strong Canadian dollar and delays in stripping the mine.</p>
<p>But even with the resurgence in zinc prices, Faro's restart could be a way's off, Lennon said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had no impression of a restart,&quot; Lennon said.</p>
<p>Failure of the lead prices to parallel zinc, could be discouraging Anvil from re-opening the mine, Lennon said.  </p>
<p>In the 14 months ended December 31, Faro produced 345,700 tonnes of zinc concentrates and 186,000 tonnes of lead concentrates, making it one of the world's biggest mines for both metals.</p>
<p>Another factor weighing on Anvil was the planned start-up of the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd Cannington lead and zinc mine in Australia, which was scheduled to begin producing 250,000 tonnes of lead and 100,000 tonnes of zinc concentrates a year next year, Lennon suggested.</p>
<p>Growth in zinc consumption should average 2.7 percent this year, rising to 3.1 percent in 1998, Lennon said.  </p>
<p>A lift in prices also would be aided by less Chinese metal exported to other markets, as China now faces limited concentrate production capacity and domestic consumption builds, Lennon said.</p>
<p>While there are probably around 250 zinc smelters in China, about 200 of the smelters only produce between 5,000 and 10,000 tonnes of zinc a year, he added.</p>
