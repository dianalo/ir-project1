<p>Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance has condemned an attack on the office and staff of a liberal Iranian magazine, newspapers reported on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;This kind of action will lead to anarchy and benefits the enemies of the revolution,&quot; the ministry said in a statement carried by newspapers. &quot;All protests against the contents of a publication must be done through legal channels and in a rational manner.&quot;</p>
<p>The office and staff of Iran-e Farda (Iran's Tomorrow) magazine, which is often critical of Iran's religious establishment, was attacked on Saturday by five men.</p>
<p>The attack resulted from a recent article that questioned the practice of obligatory religious prayers in government offices, said Reza Alijani, editor of the Persian-language monthly.</p>
<p>The story had been strongly condemned in another magazine called Shalamcheh, the mouthpiece of Iran's Ansar-e Hizbollah (Supporters of the Party of God), a group of Islamic radicals.</p>
<p>Iran-e Farda advocates a civil society within the framework of the Islamic republic and presses for the right to criticise the government. In its latest issue it warned conservatives not to block the proposed programme of reform of new President Mohammad Khatami, saying his election mandate proved that people wanted change.</p>
<p>Khatami, a moderate Moslem Shi'ite cleric, won a landslide election victory in May on a platform of economic and social change based on the principle of the rule of law.</p>
