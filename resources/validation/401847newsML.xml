<p>Are there really Japanese Red Army guerrillas held in Lebanon or are they ghosts?</p>
<p>Beirut newspapers posed the question on Tuesday, pointing up the confusion surrounding the case of the disappearing guerrillas after an unexplained series of apparently contradictory statements.</p>
<p>The Lebanese government and security officials caused surprise on Monday by denying they were holding any suspected Red Army members -- as had been widely reported last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Are there really Japanese detained in Lebanon? Or are there Malaysians, citizens from Thailand or Zimbabwe? Or are there just ghosts?&quot; the prominent Beirut daily an-Nahar asked on its front page.</p>
<p>A week ago Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said in Tokyo that Lebanese authorities had told him they had arrested up to six Red Army members.</p>
<p>Lebanese political sources quickly confirmed that arrests had been made, but declined to be identified or to give details.</p>
<p>Beirut officials were tight-lipped in public apart from Foreign Minister Faris Bouez who said on February 18 that security forces had arrested a number of suspected Japanese members of the Red Army who were being interrogated.</p>
<p>Apartment bloc residents in west Beirut told Reuters they saw two Asians -- whom they identified from newspaper photographs as among the Japanese Red Army suspects -- being taken away from their apartment by armed men in plain clothes at five a.m. on February 15.</p>
<p>Prosecutor-General Adnan Addoum, who refused to confirm or deny that arrests had taken place, kept telling reporters all would be made clear this week.</p>
<p>But then, late on Sunday night, Interior Minister Michel al-Murr dropped a bombshell by saying on television that none of the security forces he or Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri control was holding any Japanese.</p>
<p>The next day, security sources in Beirut told Reuters neither the Lebanese army nor its Deuxieme Bureau intelligence agency held any Japanese suspects.</p>
<p>Those statements appeared to exclude the possibility that Japanese suspects were being held by any Lebanese agencies.</p>
<p>And judicial sources in Beirut said on Monday they were sure that Syrian security forces in Lebanon were not holding any Japanese Red Army suspects.</p>
<p>Syria, which has 35,000 troops in Lebanon, controls the eastern Bekaa valley where some of the guerrilla suspects were said to have been arrested.</p>
<p>Amid the confusion, the Japanese embassy remained calm.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite Minister Murr's comments our contacts continue on a daily basis with relevant Lebanese authorities,&quot; a Japanese diplomat told Reuters. &quot;We await confirmation from the Lebanese on whether the persons under custody are Japanese or Japanese Red Army member.&quot;</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the Japanese foreign ministry said it had no information on the case. &quot;We have had no information from Lebanon on the case,&quot; a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Beirut newspapers have not hidden their exasperation.</p>
<p>&quot;One week after the opening of the suspense movie, the interior minister and the prosecutor general come out and say there are no Japanese detained by Lebanese authorities&quot;, columnist Sahar Baassiri wrote in an-Nahar.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Lebanese authorities do not have any Japanese, then who are those arrested? If they are not from the Red Army then on what charges were they arrested? And if they are not Japanese at all why has Tokyo been informed before their identity was confirmed?&quot; asked Baassiri.</p>
