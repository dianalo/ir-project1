<title>JAPAN: Penalty against Nomura unlikely soon--govt sources.</title>
<headline>Penalty against Nomura unlikely soon--govt sources.</headline>

<p>Punitive actions by Japan's Finance Ministry against scandal-hit Nomura Securities Co Ltd are not likely until prosecutors decide whether or not to issue indictments in the case, government sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Even in the unlikely event that the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) recommends punitive action to the ministry before prosecutors' investigations are complete, the sources said, MOF will refrain from deciding on any penalties until the investigations are over.</p>
<p>The SESC, Japan's securities watchdog, lacks the authority to take punitive action itself, but can recommend that the finance minister mete out administrative punishment and can ask prosecutors to take legal action on possible criminal violations.</p>
<p>On May 13, the SESC filed a criminal complaint with prosecutors against Nomura itself, two former Nomura executives and a current official, alleging that they compensated a client linked to a racketeer for investment losses. The complaint came after Nomura itself announced irregular stock deals on March 6.</p>
<p>Since then, prosecutors have arrested two former Nomura executives, one current executive, corporate racketeer Ryuichi Koike and his younger brother, Yoshinori Koike, in connection with the case.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also raided a leading Japanese commercial bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd (DKB), last Tuesday in connection with the Nomura scandal.</p>
<p>Top executives at DKB, including its president and chairman, have since resigned from their posts.</p>
<p>Government sources said that the length of the prosecutors' investigation will depend on whether their probe of DKB's role in the scandal focuses on suspicion of Commercial Code violations or on possible breach of trust.</p>
<p>Last Friday, when the DKB executives announced their resignation, they admitted that the bank had lent a total of 26 billion yen to Yoshinori Koike and his real estate company, but that loans were not made to his older brother Ryuichi Koike, a racketeer.</p>
<p>Japan's Commercial Code bans companies from making payments to racketeers who attempt to extort money by threatening to disrupt shareholder meetings.</p>
<p>A senior MOF official told Reuters on Monday that the ministry is now considering whether DKB's activities violated banking laws and, if so, what steps will be taken.</p>
