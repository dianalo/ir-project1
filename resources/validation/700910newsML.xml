<title>JAPAN: JGBs seen in range with no impact from FOMC.</title>
<headline>JGBs seen in range with no impact from FOMC.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1996-07-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>The key September 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) futures contract is likely to move within its recent range at around 124.50 on Thursday.</p>
<p>No impact is expected on JGBs from the decision by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) overnight to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;No rate change at the FOMC meeting is what the market had expected,&quot; said a dealer at a city bank's securities unit.</p>
<p>Downside room is narrowing as investors' cash bond buying has been detected above 124.00 recently, but the topside is also seen firmly capped at 125.00, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The contract is likely to be underpinned above 124.00 by cash buying from those who failed to buy bonds during the recent rises. But any further rise is unlikely unless investors stop selling low-coupon JGBs,&quot; the dealer said. The September ended up 0.14 at 124.50 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders said one focus is the Nikkei 225 stock index, which managed to stay above the key psychological support level of 20,000 and finished at 20,196.42 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Another focus is an annual meeting of bankers from 0500 GMT, which Bank of Japan governor Yasuo Matsushita is scheduled to address, they said.</p>
