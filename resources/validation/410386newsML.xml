<text>
<p>North Korea on Friday criticised Japan for considering a deal with the United States to join in developing a defence system against long-range missiles.</p>
<p>North Korea said the idea, proposed by Washington but not yet agreed by Japan, posed a threat to the nation.</p>
<p>The satellite and ground missile system, known as Theatre Missile Defence, would be designed to detect and destroy an incoming ballistic missile.</p>
<p>The system &quot;clearly shows again what Japan really wants,&quot; North Korea's Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement carried on the official KCNA news agency and monitored in Tokyo.</p>
<p>A newspaper report from the United States said recently that Japan had decided to drop out of the defence project but that was later denied by Japan's Foreign Ministry, which said no decision had been made.</p>
<p>For two years, Japan's defence ministry has conducted limited feasibility studies on the Theatre missile Defence, but the government has so far refused to give a full go-ahead.</p>
