<p>Two letter bombs were recovered from the incoming mail to Al Hayat, a Saudi Arabian newspaper with offices at the National Press Club building in downtown Washington, police said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The first bomb was discovered by an employee of the newspaper &quot;when he came across an envelope that he suspected to be a letter bomb,&quot; police said in a statement. The device &quot;appeared to have all the components of a letter bomb.&quot;</p>
<p>City police officers who examined the first bomb discovered a second one as they went through the remainder of the newspaper's mail, the statement said.</p>
<p>Both bombs were removed from the site and safely detonated, police said, offering no further details.</p>
<p>Washington police and the FBI's Terrorist Task Force were investigating the case.</p>
<p>Al Hayat, a Saudi newspaper based in London, had published the manifesto of a radical Islamic group after the fatal June 25 bombing of U.S. military personnel in the Saudi city of Khobar.</p>
<p>The National Press Club building is the Washington home to many U.S. and foreign news organisations and is located about two blocks from the White House.</p>
