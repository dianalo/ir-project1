<p>The Lima Stock Exchange made light gains overall Wednesday, as polymetallic miners again led the market, brokers said.</p>
<p>They predicted stability or continued gains in the remaining sessions of the week.</p>
<p>According to preliminary figures, the bolsa's General Index .IGRA rose 0.51 percent Wednesday to 2,248.87 points while the blue-chip Selective Index ISEL rose 0.83 percent to 3,244.30. Volume was an improved 64 million soles ($24.3 million) on 2,130 trades.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market is basically quiet, although the polymetallic mining sector is starting to show some volatility because the prices have risen a lot and the price of zinc has reached a point of stability in the internatinal market,&quot; said Miguel Bondy, of Andino Capital Market brokerage.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors were likely to move into electricity utilities in coming days due to their low prices on expectations of damage from the El Nino weather phenomenon.</p>
<p>Wednesday's chief winner was miner Morococha, which gained 6.48 percent to 9.70 soles, while benchmark Telefonica del Peru saw a 1.88 percent rise to 7.04 soles and Banco de Credito was up 0.41 percent to 2.46 soles.</p>
<p>Overall, 37 stocks fell, 30 rose and 26 were stable.</p>
