<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine stocks pull back at close.</title>
<headline>Argentine stocks pull back at close.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1997-05-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Argentine stocks retreated at the close Tuesday but traders shrugged off the drop as normal profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;The bolsa surrendered some ground in late trading simply because it's consolidating with a little profit-taking,&quot; an analyst at a foreign investment fund said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think prices will tilt higher again later in the week as more players return, encouraged by the strength seen on Wall Street,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index shed 0.6 percent to 734.03, erasing most of Monday's gains.  </p>
<p>Traders said Tuesday's auction of five-year local Bonte treasury bonds, which fetched interest of 8.78 percent, was successful and would help to underpin the market.</p>
<p>But they noted before rising the MerVal would have to overcome technical resistance levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The MerVal faces strong resistance between 740-750 points and will need to establish a firm floor,&quot; said Jorge Bonanno at brokers Interfin.</p>
<p>Floor volume picked up to 22.3 million pesos from 20.7 million Monday, while over-the-counter turnover swelled to 111 million pesos from 70.2 million Monday.  </p>
<p>The broad market eased 0.5 percent, with decliners beating risers 39 to 16 and 16 issues closing flat.</p>
<p>Sharpest main-tier losers were pulp and paper maker Celulosa, carmaker Ciadea and construction stock Polledo, which fell 6.0 percent, 2.1 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>The only MerVal gainers were Banco de Galicia, real estate developer Irsa and oil concern Astra, up 1.5 percent, 1.4 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively.</p>
