<p>President Bill Clinton was expected to decide within days who he will nominate to become the new chairman of the U.S. military Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Defence Department said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I would expect a decision by the president to be made in the next several days,&quot; Pentagon spokesaman Ken Bacon told reporters when asked about Clinton's choice to succeed Army Gen. John Shalikashvili as the nation's top military officer.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Defence Secretary William Cohen had discussed the matter with the president and that Clinton was expected to nominate a candidate for Senate approval &quot;soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Published speculation has centred on a small number of four-star officers including square-jawed Army Gen. Henry Shelton, 55, head of the U.S. Special Operations Command based at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida.</p>
<p>Officers in elite U.S. special forces units, trained for operations ranging from fighting behind enemy lines to peacekeeping, are known as &quot;snake eaters.&quot;</p>
<p>Defence officials, who asked not to be identified, said others believed to also be high on Cohen's short list included Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Charles Krulak; Navy Adm. Joseph Lopez, chief of southern NATO forces based in Naples, Italy, and Army Gen. Wesley Clark, recently approved as head of all allied NATO forces in Europe.</p>
<p>But officials said Cohen and Clinton might be reluctant to yank Clark away from his new alliance job. He speaks Russian and was instrumental in helping negotiate the Dayton Peace Accords on Bosnia.</p>
<p>Shalikashvili retires in October and Cohen's first choice to replace him, Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, withdrew from consideration last month after disclosure of an adulterous affair more than 10 years ago. Ralston is vice chairman of the joint chiefs.</p>
<p>Cohen said last week he had narrowed his list of candidates to three or four and had discussed them with Clinton at the NATO summit meeting in Madrid.</p>
<p>He also told reporters flying home with him from Europe on Monday that he planned to hold a final meeting with Clinton on the matter within days.</p>
<p>Defence officials were reluctant to make a prediction after the embarrassing Ralston incident. But several said they believed the green-bereted Shelton, who was a commander of the U.S. military operation in Haiti, was a top candidate.</p>
<p>&quot;Shelton is the kind of guy who the president likes. Both Shelton and Lopez are team players, very capable and with key joint operations experience&quot; involving all military services, said one official privately.</p>
<p>Cohen told reporters who travelled with him to Brussels in mid-June that he would not insist on &quot;abolute perfection&quot; in his search for a new commander despite the Ralston incident.</p>
<p>&quot;I will look for the best possible individual ... a very high standard will be exacted,&quot; he said, adding that joint operations experience would be one major factor.</p>
