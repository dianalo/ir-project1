<title>UK: Coffee--Brazil values ease further, rest hold.</title>
<headline>Coffee--Brazil values ease further, rest hold.</headline>

<p>Cash differentials for Brazilian coffee continued to decline ahead of the country's main harvest but other origin prices remained firm on tight nearby availabilities.</p>
<p>The fall in Brazilian prices attracted reasonable buying activity as roasters increasingly turning to Brazils and robusta coffee to fill in the demand in view of the tightness of other washed arabicas.</p>
<p>The Brazilian harvest will begin in earnest in June. Already the amount offered for sales has risen considerably, traders said.</p>
<p>Brazil 3/4 medium good bean was quoted at 12 cents under New York's July FOB against 3-8 cents last week.</p>
<p>Bids were heard at 13-14 cents under.</p>
<p>Brazil 2/3 17/18s were heard at a wide range of between 8 and 17 cents under against two cents under a week ago.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been reasonable activity in Brazil coffees, simply because they can replace any mild coffee,&quot; said an European trader.</p>
<p>&quot;Further more, roasters are applying the so-called flexible blending system, using more Brazils and robustas in view of the scarce mild coffee supply,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A trader at a large European roaster said: &quot;Some roasters are still short of higher-quality arabicas and they have to be creative in their blends.&quot;</p>
<p>Other traders said European coffee demand was generally slow with some roasters awaiting fresh orders for roasted coffee.</p>
<p>&quot;For the time being, they have enough coffee,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>But based on pending fixation ratios on the New York arabica futures market, roasters have more contracts to fix than the origin sellers.</p>
<p>&quot;This is giving support to the market,&quot; the same trader said.</p>
<p>New York prices rose on Tuesday on widespread talk, later confirmed, that leading U.S. roasters Folgers would raise its retail prices by 20 cents, effective immediately.</p>
<p>Announcements of retail price hikes are seen as bullish as the news would usually trigger consumer hoarding and create additional green coffee demand.</p>
<p>Benchmark July rose to 201 cents, the session's highs, up 4.60 cents on the day, by 1511 GMT.</p>
<p>In robustas, the Ugandan spread has shot up dramatically with the main crop mostly sold out and buyers were forced to pay up to secure the little coffee left.</p>
<p>One trader quoted Ugandan screen 15 at $150 over LIFFE CIF Europe against $15 some two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Following are differentials for some origins:</p>
<p> Brazil 3/4 medium good bean	  12 cents/lb under NY July</p>
<p>FOB</p>
<p> Brazil 2/4 17/18			 8-17 cents under NY</p>
<p> Costa Rica (July/Aug)		  46 cents over NY Sept (46-kg</p>
<p>bag)</p>
<p> Nicaragua new crop (Dec/Jan/Feb)   6 over NY (46-kg bag)</p>
<p> Vietnam Grade 2			  $100 under LIFFE July C&amp;F</p>
<p> Indonesia EK1			    $200-$210 under LIFFE FOB</p>
<p> Ivory Coast Grade 2		    $20 under LIFFE CIF Europe</p>
<p> Cameroon Grade 2			 $50 under LIFFE CIF Europe</p>
<p> Uganda Screen 15			 $150 over LIFFE CIF Europe</p>
