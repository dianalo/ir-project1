<p>Stepping up a public relations campaign for currency union as the 1999 launch nears, two Bundesbank officials on Monday said there will be no shortcuts to EMU if the new Euro currency is to succeed.</p>
<p>As the two council members echoed Germany's uncompromising demand that nations meet a slew of entry criteria to join the planned union. But one official underscored the Maastricht Treaty provides leeway for interpreting fiscal criteria.</p>
<p>Urging Europeans not to become bogged down with emotional public discussions about the entry criteria's precise numbers, council member Ernst Welteke said the Treaty demands only that nations avoid excessive public deficits.</p>
<p>&quot;The Treaty for the currency union only forbids excessive deficits, but the reference values that a public deficit should not exceed three percent of gross domestic product and government debt must not exceed 60 percent of gross domestic product are already enshrined in the Treaty on Europe's economic union,&quot; Welteke said.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to achieve sustainable fiscal austerity and that doesn't necessarily need to be 63 percent,&quot; said Welteke, who is also president of the state central bank in Hesse.</p>
<p>&quot;In some cases, having a budget deficit of three percent to gross domestic product is far too much.&quot;</p>
<p>Fielding a barrage of questions on whether or not the Bundesbank is compromising on demands that only nations showing sufficient convergence may enter the currency union, Welteke sought to assure his audience that Germany was not ready to let everyone in.</p>
<p>&quot;I am only arguing that the fiscal criteria be interpreted as they are laid down in the Treaty. And these criteria should not be over-interpreted,&quot; Welteke said.</p>
<p>&quot;No nation should be allowed in which does not show a sufficient amount of stability,&quot; Welteke warned.</p>
<p>At the same time in Berlin, Bundesbank council member Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher, who is also president of the state central bank in Berlin and Brandenburg, told his audience he opposed any relaxation of the entry criteria.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is any horse trading, then it can be feared that people will shift into other currencies. This could result in great turbulence and that nations will exit the common currency again,&quot; Kuehbacher said.</p>
<p>By pointing out that the Treaty allows some leeway, Welteke neither contradicted Kuehbacher nor hinted at any sort of rift on interpretation among Bundesbank council members.</p>
<p>Only a few days ago Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer also said the Treaty allowed leeway for the fiscal criteria.</p>
<p>Besides meeting the two fiscal criteria, nations must present stable exchange rates, low inflation rates and moderate interest rates to be admitted to the currency union.</p>
<p>Their 1997 economic data will be evaluated by a group of politicians in 1998, who will then determine which nations will actually be allowed to join on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>Germany and France will surely be among the first group to join &quot;as a currency union without them would make no political sense,&quot; Welteke forecast.</p>
<p>In addition, another five to six nations should be ready to participate by that time, leaving the total number of participants at seven or eight, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;You can figure out which nations are likely to be among those participating,&quot; Welteke said. He refused to be drawn out on speculation whether or not Italy, which at the weekend scrambled back into the ERM as part of a bid to be in the first group to join EMU, will actually make it.</p>
<p>Welteke shrugged off calls for the currency union to be delayed saying savings packages, put together now as part of efforts to join the currency union, would need to be implemented in any case.</p>
<p>&quot;We need the spending cuts in any case, they cannot be blamed on the European currency union,&quot; he said.</p>
