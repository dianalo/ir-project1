<headline>S&amp;P may cut Vattenfall long-, short-term ratings.</headline>
<text>
<p>NEW YORK, Feb 6 - Standard &amp; Poor's today has placed its double-A' long-term and A-1'-plus short-term ratings of Vattenfall AB and Vattenfall Treasury AB, guaranteed by the 100% government- owned Vattenfall AB, on CreditWatch with negative implications.</p>
<p>The A-1'-plus commercial paper rating of Vattenfall Treasury Inc. also has been placed on CreditWatch with negative implications.</p>
<p>At the same time, Standard &amp; Poor's double-A'-minus long-term and A-1'-plus short-term ratings of Sydkraft AB remain on CreditWatch with negative implications, where they were placed Jan. 15, 1997.</p>
<p>This action reflects the uncertainties caused by the announcement of the Swedish Government that it will start the phase-out of nuclear power by closing one reactor at the Barseback nuclear power plant, which is 100% owned by Sydkraft, before July 1, 1998.</p>
<p>While Vattenfall, which is the largest generator and supplier of electricity in Sweden, is not directly affect by the closure of the Barseback nuclear power plant, Vattenfall might have to contribute power to make the phase-out possible.</p>
<p>In addition, Vattenfall is likely to facilitate the transition from nuclear power with investments in plants fueled by other sources of energy.</p>
<p>It is uncertain how Vattenfall will be compensated for potential electricity supply to Sydkraft and the degree to which the electric utility may be forced to make large investments in alternative sources of power.</p>
<p>Furthermore, new directives from the government owner to Vattenfall will be published, which may suggest a change in the future business strategy of the electric utility.</p>
<p>Sydkraft's ratings remain on CreditWatch with negative implications, awaiting the outcome of the negotiation between the Swedish government and the management of Sydkraft.</p>
<p>The electric utility claims the right to full compensation in power for the nuclear reactor to be closed down. Sydkraft is a vertically integrated electricity producer, accounting for 20% of Sweden's generation, making it the country's second-largest generator.</p>
<p>Sydkraft originally was placed on CreditWatch following the announcement that it was to acquire a stake of Hamburgische Elektricitats-Werke. However, this investment has now been financed through sales of shares in VEBA.</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's will meet with government representatives and management of the electric utilities in the near future to discuss the operational and financial implications of the nuclear-phase out.</p>
