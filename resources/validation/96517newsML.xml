<title>USA: Raytheon sees operating income down, earnings up.</title>
<headline>Raytheon sees operating income down, earnings up.</headline>

<p>Raytheon Co. said Friday it expected its third quarter operating income to fall 15 percent from the year-earlier level, sparking a sharp drop in its stock.</p>
<p>Raytheon's stock fell $4 to $49 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock exchange.</p>
<p>The $12 billion Lexington, Mass.-based firm, which is refocusing itself into a commercial company that makes airplanes and electronics as well as defence equipment, lost $75 million in its appliance and its Raytheon Engineering &amp; Constructor units, company officials said.</p>
<p>It would be the first time since 1983 that Raytheon reported a decline in operating income, the company's Chief Financial Officer Peter D'Angelo said in a conference call.</p>
<p>It will use a $75 million research and development tax credit so it can keep its earnings per share at industry estimates of 89 cents. Raytheon earned $354 million, or 82 cents per share adjusted for a stock split, in the third quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>D'Angelo said he fully expected earnings per share in 1996 to be above the $3.23 earnings per share for all of 1995, when the company posted earnings of $787 million.</p>
<p>The problems came in two areas.</p>
<p>Raytheon Engineering &amp; Constructor, the company's largest single unit with $3 billion in revenues designs and builds various industrial plants and production facilities. But its customers in developing countries have had trouble getting financing in place for the projects, said the head of the unit, Chuck Miller.</p>
<p>He said he expected a number of projects worth $4 billion to come through in time for fourth-quarter reporting.</p>
<p>An eight-week strike at Raytheon Engineering's Cedar Rapids, Iowa, plant was blamed for $8 million of the third quarter operating loss.</p>
<p>The company's sales of appliances -- Raytheon makes Amana, Caloric and Speed Queen appliances -- also were hit by a cool summer. Bob Swan, head of the appliance division, told reporters in a conference call that cool weather affected the sales of air conditioning units.</p>
<p>He said industry data showed sales of refrigeration and stoves also would remain weak through year's end, but he thought Raytheon would outperform the competition through year's end.</p>
<p>The company previously announced it would take a special charge of 9 cents a share, or $34 million pre-tax, to close a plant in Delaware, Ohio.</p>
<p>JSA Research Inc., analyst Paul Nesbit, who rates the company a strong buy, said the sharp price drop &quot;makes it even</p>
