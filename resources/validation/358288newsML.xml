<p>By his own admission, the Rev. Frank Pavone eats, drinks and sleeps the abortion issue.</p>
<p>A Catholic priest based in New York City, Pavone has devoted his life to the fight against abortion, which he regards as by far the greatest evil in American society. As a celibate and member of the Salesian Order, he has renounced the possibility of marriage and fatherhood, but he says his work against abortion more than compensates for the loss.</p>
<p>&quot;The pro-life movement has become my family. We have a real strong sense of kinship,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;I am working on this issue full time. I take three trips a week to all parts of the country. I eat, drink and sleep this issue. I meet so many wonderful people.&quot;</p>
<p>Pavone heads Priests for Life, a church-backed group that helps organise clergy throughout the country for political action against abortion and euthanasia. He took the post in 1993 after five years as a parish priest in Staten Island and finds the work so absorbing he hopes to continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>&quot;I think abortion is the No. 1 one critical problem that we have. Statistically it has the greatest number of victims -- 4,400 a day. And there is the harm it brings to those involved in it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pavone grew up in an Italian-American family that was not particularly religious, but by the age of 17 he found himself more and more attracted to the priesthood.</p>
<p>OPPOSES VIOLENCE</p>
<p>A mild-mannered man, he says he opposes the extremes of the anti-abortion movement, some of whose members advocate violence. In recent years, anti-abortion activists have bombed abortion clinics, terrorised clients and staff and even committed murder.</p>
<p>&quot;Violence, in the sense of deliberately killing people or destroying property, is wrong. All violence is wrong. We would be very much opposed to violence,&quot; Pavone said.</p>
<p>But on the issue itself, he is a hardliner, opposed to abortion even when it is carried out to save the life of the mother. He also opposes most birth control, seeing it as a form of abortion.</p>
<p>&quot;If a person acknowledges that unique human life begins at fertilisation, there's an overlapping of the abortion and contraception issues,&quot; he said. &quot;Contraception thwarts the meaning of the sexual act. We see sex as total self-giving. It becomes a holding back -- at that point one or both of the couple says, 'I'm holding back my fertility.'&quot;</p>
<p>Some in the anti-abortion movement would allow the procedure in cases where the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest or to protect the life of the mother. Pavone is willing to join with them for now for tactical reasons but he will not compromise on his final goal -- the total elimination of all abortions.</p>
<p>&quot;It would not be our final goal to allow abortions in cases of rape and/or to save the life of the mother. We say it's always wrong to kill an innocent child. The ultimate goal is giving full protection to all children,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The abortion issue arguably generates more passion than any other in American politics, with strongly held views on both sides. A majority of Americans seem uneasy about abortion but unwilling to deprive women of the right to choose.</p>
<p>CLINTON WON CATHOLIC VOTE</p>
<p>In the last presidential election, President Bill Clinton won 51 percent of the Catholic vote, compared to 49 percent of the overall vote, despite his veto of a bill that would have outlawed a form of late-term abortion.</p>
<p>Polling data show that women voters have been swinging against the Republican Party, which in its official platform calls for making all abortions illegal. Last November, Clinton beat his Republican opponent by 16 percentage points among women but lost by one point among men.</p>
<p>But Pavone insists most Americans still do not grasp the real meaning of abortion. &quot;I'm convinced it is not clear to people. Most people never see an abortion -- the children are never seen. On a psychological level, it doesn't break through to people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Despite his views, Pavone wants his opponents to know he still regards them as capable of redemption and eternal life. &quot;I want to listen to these people and understand what makes them do what they're doing,&quot; he said. &quot;It breaks down prejudices and misconceptions that might be there. It lets them know I still regard them as human beings.&quot;</p>
