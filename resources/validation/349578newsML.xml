<p>Kelly Hrudey stepped in for injured goalie Ed Belfour as the last-place San Jose Sharks edged the first-place Colorado Avalanche 2-1 Saturday.</p>
<p>Jeff Friesen scored the game-winner 68 seconds into the third period. His 15th goal of the season came off a scramble in front of the Colorado net when he poked a loose puck past Patrick Roy, who lost to San Jose for the first time in his career (11-1-1).</p>
<p>&quot;Owen (Nolan) shoveled at it and I don't think Roy knew where it was,&quot; Friesen said. &quot;I just tried to get it up and over his pads.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't play our best,&quot; Roy said. &quot;In the last 10 minutes we had some good shots but Kelly Hrudey made some great saves.&quot;</p>
<p>Hrudey stopped 11 shots after starting the third period for Belfour, who was playing at home for the first time since he was acquired in a trade with Chicago.</p>
<p>Belfour hurt his knee with five minutes left in the second period when he tried to deflect a breakaway shot by Rene Corbet that hit the left post. Belfour completed the period but did not return, finishing with 16 saves.</p>
<p>San Jose has just three goals in three games against Colorado this season but snapped a four-game losing streak against the Avalanche, who still have the league's best record at 31-13-8.</p>
<p>&quot;Tonight our best players weren't our best players and that was very, very obvious,&quot; coach Marc Crawford said.</p>
<p>Sharks winger Owen Nolan scored for the first time in eight meetings against his former team.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a great win for us,&quot; Nolan said. &quot;It's extra nice for myself to finally get a piece of the action and help beat those guys. I think we proved tonight that we can beat any team in the league if we work hard.&quot;</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Mark Messier's goal less than three minutes into the third period snapped a tie and powered the New York Rangers to a 4-2 victory over the Flyers.</p>
<p>Nicklas Sundstrom added a goal and an assist for the Rangers, who improved to 3-1-1 in their last five games. New York is 1-1-1 in its three games against the Flyers this season, but has just six goals in the three games.</p>
<p>Mike Richter made 39 saves for New York.</p>
<p>Shjon Podein and Eric Lindros tallied for Philadelphia. Ron Hextall had 13 saves for the Flyers.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Mario Lemieux scored twice and Petr Nedved had a goal and an assist to lead the Penguins to a 4-1 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes.</p>
<p>Patrick Lalime made 29 saves for the Penguins, who snapped a two-game home losing streak.</p>
<p>Lalime was Rookie of the Month for the second straight month and Lemieux, who is one goal short of becoming the seventh player in NHL history with 600 goals, was Player of the Month for January.</p>
<p>In St Louis, Brendan Shanahan scored his 27th and 28th goals to lead the Detroit Red Wings to a 4-1 victory over the Blues in the first meeting between the Central Division rivals this season.</p>
<p>The win was only the second in seven games (2-3-2) for the Red Wings, who moved one point ahead of St Louis and into a tie for third place in the Western Conference with Edmonton.</p>
<p>The loss was just the second in eight games for the Blues.</p>
<p>At Tampa Bay, Ray Bourque had a goal and two assists to become the Boston Bruins' all-time leading scorer and Rob Tallas made 25 saves for his first career shutout in a 3-0 victory over the Lightning.</p>
<p>The goal gave Bourque 1,340 points, breaking a tie with John Bucyk. He has goals in four straight games after scoring six times in his first 30 games.</p>
<p>At Florida, Peter Bondra had a goal and an assist and Anson Carter scored his first NHL goal as the Washington Capitals snapped a four-game losing streak with a 3-1 victory over the Panthers.</p>
<p>Michal Pivonka scored the first goal of the game.</p>
<p>Florida's four-game winning streak came to an end.</p>
<p>In Toronto, Shawn McEachern scored one minute into the third period as the Ottawa Senators defeated the Maple Leafs 2-1 in a matchup of the worst teams in each conference.</p>
<p>Tie Domi had the lone tally for Toronto, which has dropped four straight at home and was held to a season-low 20 shots at Maple Leaf Gardens.</p>
<p>Toronto defenceman Craig Wolanin got the other goal.</p>
<p>In Calgary, Trevor Kidd made 31 saves for his third shutout of the season and Aaron Gavey scored a pair of power-play goals to lead the Flames to a 3-0 victory.</p>
<p>Kidd helped the Flames win for the first time in three meetings with the Canucks this season.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, Ulf Dahlen's second goal in as many games capped a three-goal comeback as the Chicago Blackhawks defeated the Kings 3-2.</p>
<p>Dahlen and Denis Savard each recorded a goal and an assist for the Blackhawks.</p>
<p>Kai Nurminen and Ray Ferraro tallied for the Kings, who have won just 18 games and are last in the Pacific Division.</p>
<p>In Montreal, Steve Sullivan scored on a partial breakaway with 9:12 left in the third period as the New Jersey Devils rallied for a 4-4 tie with the Canadiens.</p>
<p>Dave Andreychuk scored twice for New Jersey, which has tied three straight games.</p>
