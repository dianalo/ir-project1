<p>The day belonged to industrials which powered higher from the start to finish a strong 1.08 percent up, carrying the all-share index with.</p>
<p>Trade was mostly futures-driven with basket players -- among them many foreigners -- selling futures and buying stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;Industrials boomed higher all day and it was mainly on futures-related activity,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>But trade started strong as a firm underlying trend -- a hangover from Friday -- supported shares at their open.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Wall Street's eighth record close was encouragement enough for local shares to leap in early trade and be carried higher by generally strong world markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade was booming. Wall Street was driving it but also other global markets have had an impact,&quot; one dealer said, adding that a firmer rand and bond rates had lent support.</p>
<p>Dealers said much stock had been somewhat oversold last Friday and a number of investors -- made confident by strong world markets -- crept in to snap up bargains.</p>
<p>A newspaper report that commercial banks had appealed to the Reserve Bank to help avert an increase in prime overdraft rates by easing pressure in the money market gave more encouragement.</p>
<p>Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals had responded to the banks' appeal by urging them to curb their lending and adding that the Bank was looking at ways to facilitate their access to liquid assets.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has quite definitely taken the whole story as quite positive,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Overall volumes had not been spectacular and dealers said the number of shares traded had shrunk as Wall Street's open neared. Many feared that the U.S. market could not sustain another bull run and would slip taking local shares with it.</p>
<p>Industrial finished a powerful 87.3 points higher at 8,135.6, drawing the all-share index 72.7 points up to 6,915.3.</p>
<p>But all was not rosy.</p>
<p>The bullion price -- appearing frail enough to test $377 an ounce support -- depressed gold shares which tried to inch higher on a generally jubilant market mood but failed and dipped to close.</p>
<p>Dealers believed gold shares would remain dulled unless bullion braved above $380 an ounce again.</p>
<p>They struggled to climb throughout the day and ended 9.5 points weaker at 1,711.4.</p>
<p>A number of shares were carried by the strong industrial wave with De Beers, Anglo and SA Breweries all firmer.</p>
<p>Amic and AECI traded higher on the back of a strong industrials. Amic finished 700 cents or 4.24 percent stronger at 172 rand and AECI added 175 cents or 7.22 percent to 26 rand.</p>
<p>Iscor also soared on demand for industrial shares, adding 4.23 percent to 345 cents in a large volume of 2.5 million shares changing hands.</p>
<p>Absa also enjoyed a good day of gains, putting on 60 cents or 2.67 percent to close at 23.10 rand, fuelled by expectations of strong interim results next Monday.</p>
<p>Despite players selling futures, the December industrial futures contract held earlier gains won on the back of Wall Streets record close last Friday and the report of the commercial banks' appeal.</p>
<p>But the all-share equity contract was static at close, failing to take heart from industrial futures.</p>
<p>Golds were softer -- but not as feeble as would have been feared, carried by an underlying positive market mood.</p>
<p>The industrial futures contract was at 7,837/45 from 7,760 as the December all-share index was unchanged at 6,320. Gold contracts dip to 1,220/28 from 1,238.</p>
