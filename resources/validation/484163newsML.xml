<p>Leading Russian shares were little changed on Thursday, but traders said new money and positive economic and political developments at home and abroad would help nudge the market upward in coming weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;This has been a very extended sluggish period, but over the next few of weeks -- into May -- we should see a bit better performance,&quot; said a trader at Troika Dialog.</p>
<p>The trader said new money was already appearing and the effects would become visible as the quarter progressed.</p>
<p>Yesterday's 25.64 percent jump on the Russian Trading System 23-share index, which national brokers association NAUFOR said was caused by artificial prices for oil company Varegyonneftegaz shares, would have no serious effect on trading, she said.</p>
<p>The RTS index opened unchanged at 375.06 on Thursday, but a spokesman for NAUFOR said the association would discuss today whether to exclude Varegyonneftegaz from the RTS's list of shares used to calculate the index.</p>
<p>&quot;It is possible they might decide to recalculate the index to bring it back to the level it was before the jump yesterday,&quot; said spokesman Sergei Glovanyov.</p>
<p>Electric company UES eased to $0.1907 at GMT 1000 from Wednesday's $0.1905 close. Regional power utility Mosenergo MSNG.RTS edged up to $0.1.265 from $1.264 while oil company LUKoil was off at $13.97 after $14.00.</p>
<p>Traders said yesterday's signing of a watered down pact between Russia and Belarus and signs that the IMF will resume its lending programme to Russia were among factors that could help firm the market in coming weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole picture is looking fairly rosy for Russia - I expect a firming of the market in April,&quot; said co-head of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell trading Pavel Gronbjerg.</p>
<p>He said stable international markets and press reports recommending emerging markets, including Russia, would also contribute to the upward trend.</p>
<p>Dealers said government restructuring plans for the electricity sector, as well as 1996 company results, would be important in drawing back foreign investors, who are still the main players in the Russian market.</p>
<p>&quot;Clarification in the electricity sector will be very important,&quot; said the Troika Dialog trader.</p>
<p>Gronbjerg said investors were staking out their positions in advance of any developments.</p>
<p>&quot;The big play will be on UES in the blue chips. The news will be either good or bad and people are placing their bets now,&quot; Gronbjerg said.</p>
