<p>NYMEX electricity futures were expected to open slightly higher Wednesday based on support from expectations of heating demand in the U.S. West, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking at possibly a dime higher on the front months,&quot; one Houston-based futures trader said.</p>
<p>May Palo Verde (PV) was called to open up 10 cents from Tuesday's settlement at $15.89 per megawatt hour (MWh), while May California Oregon Border (COB) was expected to open flat to 10 cents above Tuesday's settlement at $12.61 per MWh, the sources said.</p>
<p>May PV was assessed at $15.75-16.15 in early Wednesday over-the-counter discussion.</p>
<p>The futures contracts settled mostly lower Tuesday on forecasts of warmer temperatures and the return of several generating units from unplanned outages in the western U.S.</p>
<p>The units returning to service included the 1,073 megawatt (MW) Diablo Canyon nuclear unit 2 in Avila Beach, Calif., the 1,212 MW Helms pumped storage hydroelectric plant near Fresno, Calif., and the 750 MW Navajo coal-fired power plant near Page, Ariz.,</p>
<p>The futures decrease Tuesday was also partially attributed to lower physical power prices in the West due in part to forecasts of warmer weather.</p>
<p>But sources said weather forecasts could mean some additional power demand due to air conditioner use, especially in the U.S. Southwest.</p>
<p>Weather in the Pacific Northwest was forecast to be dry and mild through the weekend, averaging three to eight degrees above normal. Some possible precipitation was seen by Sunday.</p>
<p>Longer-term forecasts called for above-normal temperatures in the Pacific Northwest from April 20 to 24, with near normal temperatures in the northwest portion of the area during the same period.</p>
<p>In the Southwest, temperatures were expected to be three to 15 degrees above normal with dry conditions through the weekend. Temperatures were seen returning to near-normal levels early next week.</p>
