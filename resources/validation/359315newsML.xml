<p>The prices of U.S. Treasury securities closed narrowly mixed in very quiet trading before the release of Friday's nonfarm payrolls report.</p>
<p>What little the market had to digest before the 830 EST/1330 GMT release of the report cast a negative spin. Initial jobless claims came in about 12,000 below forecasts and minutes from the Federal Reserve showed its policy-making arm retained a bias toward tightening at its December meeting.</p>
<p>The 30-year long bond ended 1/32 lower at 96-22/32. Its yield was unchanged at 6.76 percent.  </p>
<p>A Reuters consensus for the employment report called for the creation of 237,000 payrolls and 5.2-percent jobless rate.</p>
<p>&quot;I keep counseling people to stare past the headline number. I don't know what the Labor Department's problem is, but this number keeps getting goofier in its preliminary form,&quot; said Fred Sturm, economist with Fuji Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Sturm said that the gap between the original number and the final revision two months later is so wide as to render the headline number almost meaningless.</p>
<p>The only component he pays attention to, Sturm said, was average hourly earnings -- which also captures the Fed's eye.  </p>
<p>Sturm said a reading of unchanged to less in average hourly earnings would be unambiguously bullish, a 1-cent to 5-cent hike neutral and anything above 5 cents bad news.</p>
<p>&quot;You couldn't talk away from a number like that, there's no way around it,&quot; he said. More importantly, Sturm said the range of forecasts for the healine number &quot;covered a 40-acre field -- a dead giveaway that nobody knows what's going on.&quot;</p>
<p>Sturm saw a neutral headline number leaving the bond market vulnerable to a slight pullback, to levels seen about a week ago when the long bond was yielding 6.85 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;There were no surprises in the FOMC minutes. The Fed continues to preach that patience is a virtue,&quot; said Cary Leahey, senior economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Leahey noted that initial jobless claims were weaker than expected and crimped the market somewhat early in the session, before it recovered to levels steady from Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people were taking profits from the big rally we've seen and exiting the market -- setting positions before the payrolls number,&quot; Leahey said. &quot;That's pretty much all that happened today -- a downtrade to take advantage of the rally.&quot;  </p>
<p>Leahey said he expected to see payrolls rise 225,000 given the five-week reporting period.</p>
<p>Chrysler Corp. priced a $500 million century bond as corporate issuance continued strong. However, Hugh Johnson, chief economist at First Albany Corp. said supply was not weighing on the bond market.</p>
<p>&quot;There's substantial liquidity right now. The question is how demanding the borrowers will be,&quot; Johnson said.</p>
<p>Payrolls data will set the tone for the bond market for the next three weeks, Johnson said, and he expected Friday's report to contain a number of surprises.  </p>
<p>Johnson also expected a 225,000 rise in payrolls and intended to closely watch the average hourly earnings, average workweek and overtime hours components of the report.</p>
<p>&quot;It was quiet today ahead of payrolls as you would expect. This has been an extremely important number for the last 24 months,&quot; Johnson said.</p>
<p>Also on Thursday, the two-year note was down 1/32 at 99-30/31 and yielded 5.91 percent; the five-year closed unchanged at 100-4/32 and yielded 6.22 percent, and the 10-year note closed up 1/32 at 100-8/32 to yield 6.46 percent.</p>
