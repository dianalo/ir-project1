<p>South Korean police on Thursday blamed radical student leftists for the death of a man whose body was found at a university campus in the southwest city of Kwangju last month, newspapers and television said.</p>
<p>The leading Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported that police suspected Lee Jong-kwon, 25, had been beaten by students who thought he was a police informant.</p>
<p>If proved true, it would be the second case of militant students beating to death suspected police spies.</p>
<p>The outlawed student body Hanchongryon took responsibility last week for the death of 22-year-old Lee Suk, a factory worker who died from beatings by students trying to extract a written confession that he was an informant.</p>
<p>The Chosun Ilbo reported that Kwangju police were searching for about 10 students in connection with the new case.</p>
<p>It said Lee Jong-kwon was found dead on May 27 at Chunnam National University's student union building. An autopsy showed he had been hit by a &quot;dull object&quot; and was badly bruised on his limbs and shoulder and had two broken ribs.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, 31 militant students went on hunger strike in protest against a government crackdown on the pro-Pyongyang Hanchongryon, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The students chained themselves to a steel rail along a ramp in the Roman Catholic Church in Seoul's Myongdong area. The cathedral is a traditional sanctuary for anti-government protesters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have decided to stage an indefinite hunger strike because the government is using the death of two people as an excuse to suppress the student movement,&quot; their spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>One policeman was also killed while trying to end a violent street demonstration by the group.</p>
<p>State prosecutors on Tuesday ordered the arrest of scores of Hanchongryon leaders and formally banned the group, which the government maintains takes orders from Pyongyang.</p>
<p>The militant group has called for the resignation of President Kim Young-sam and the reunification of the Korean peninsula under a formula suggested by communist North Korea.</p>
<p>&quot;The Kim Young-sam regime is trying to avert a political crisis by cracking down on the Hanchongryon. It is trying to divert public attention from a scandal over the over-spending in the 1992 presidential elections,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Opposition parties have claimed the president massively over-spent to get elected, and are demanding a full accounting.</p>
<p>Police have arrested three Hanchongryon activists over the fatal beating of Lee Suk.</p>
