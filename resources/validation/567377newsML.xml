<p>Six children aged 11 months to 10 years died when fire swept through a three-story, wood-framed apartment building in this New York City suburb, police said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Firefighters were able to bring four of the children out of the burning building alive, Passaic police said, but they died later in a hospital. The bodies of two other children were found hours later in the rubble.</p>
<p>Police Lt. Robert Fulleman said the relationship among the children was unclear. Fox News reported that the children lived in the building with their mother and grandmother.</p>
<p>Fulleman said the dead included Jessina Rodriguez, 9; Ryan Aguilar, 11 months; Joseph Crespo, 4; Christine Rivera, 7; Joalei Crespo, 2; and Zuleyka Rodriguez, 10.</p>
<p>Three adults were also injured in the fire, which began about 6 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, he said.</p>
