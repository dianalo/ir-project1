<p>Shares in Belgian hamburger chain Quick led the Brussels bourse higher in early trade on Thursday.</p>
<p>By 0830 GMT, Quick was up 6.67 percent at 2,240 francs, taking its gain over the last two sessions to more than 10 percent.</p>
<p>Quick's move started Wednesday on news Antwerp brokerage Bank Delen rated the stock a buy. Analyst Gert De Mesure said he had a target price for the stock of 2,400 to 2,500 francs.</p>
<p>Traders and other analysts were sceptical. &quot;Frankly, I remain very cautious,&quot; one trader at another brokerage said.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think the move is a bit exaggerated,&quot; analyst Sandra Vandersmissen at Generale Bank said. &quot;If it goes up much more I would think about a sell opportunity. Sales may have been up 10 percent in the first half, but that says nothing about same store sales. We will only know those after first half results.&quot;</p>
<p>Kredietbank said in its August summary of share recommendations -- when Quick was at 2,030 francs -- it had a &quot;neutral minus&quot; stance on the company.</p>
<p>Current net earnings per share were likely to be 98 francs in 1997, up from 91 francs in 1996, it said.  </p>
<p>Another trader said, however, that he was not surprised by the move, given widespread newspaper coverage on Thursday of Wednesday's move in an otherwise quiet period.</p>
<p>The 2,100 francs level was also important technically for the share, he said. Once that was broken -- as happened in early trade -- it was bound to go higher.</p>
<p>Quick's rise failed to give a lift to its main shareholder, retailer GIB, whose shares were down five francs at 1,850 francs, bucking the general market trend.</p>
<p>The Bel-20 index, of which GIB is a component, was up 0.60 percent at 2,481.05 points.</p>
