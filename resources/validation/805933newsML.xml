<p>President Clinton will demand that tobacco companies boost the $368.5 billion tobacco settlement reached in June by at least $50 billion to offset a special industry tax break, a U.S. official said Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to insist that the industry pay at least an additional $50 billion to offset the write-off in the budget agreement,&quot; White House domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed said. &quot;We also plan to insist on ... more expensive penalties if they fail to meet the targets for reducing youth smoking.&quot;</p>
<p>Reed, speaking in an interview, was referring to a tax write-off inserted in the tax portion of the balanced-budget agreement designed to offset the cost to tobacco firms of a 15 cent-a-pack tax increase to fund children's health care.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Barry Toiv said the tax credit was slipped into the balanced-budget pact, which was signed into law two weeks ago, at the behest of top Republicans and over the objections of the Clinton administration.</p>
<p>Under the landmark settlement reached in June, which is subject to Congressional approval, tobacco companies agreed to pay billions of dollars to settle the smoking-related lawsuits brought by individuals and states.</p>
<p>They also agreed to curb their advertising and marketing drastically and to pay cash penalties if they failed to meet targets for reducing youth smoking. In exchange, they would be protected from certain categories of lawsuits.</p>
<p>Under the settlement, smoking by those 18 or under must fall by 30 percent in five years, 50 percent in seven years and 60 percent within 10 years. If those targets are not met, the companies would collectively be required to pay an $80 million fine for each percentage point they fall short.</p>
<p>This penalty would be capped at $2 billion a year.</p>
<p>Reed said that the White House had not yet decided how to toughen these penalties.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking at a range of options: eliminating the tax deductibility of the penalties, lifting the $2 billion cap, raising the amount that companies would have to pay for each percentage point of failure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The aide added that Clinton would insist on structuring the settlement to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) retains the authority to regulate nicotine as a drug.</p>
<p>He said the administration also wanted to ensure that the procedures under which the industry discloses documents were strong and that the interests of tobacco farmers, who were not parties to the settlement, are protected.</p>
<p>Reed said that tobacco farmers, whom the White House has consulted as it reviewed the settlement, would like companies to buy more of their tobacco leaf domestically.</p>
<p>Separately, a U.S. official familiar with the White House analysis said the administration expects the settlement to raise cigarette prices by about 77 cents a pack, with about 62 cents of that from the cost of the settlement and 15 cents from the new tax to fund children's health care.</p>
<p>The official, who asked not to be identified, said the administration expected a 15 percent to 20 percent drop in the number of smokers by 2002 and a drop of up to 30 percent in the number of youth smokers over the same five-year period.</p>
<p>The official said this suggested the overall number of smokers, currently at 50 million, could fall by as much as 10 million while the number of youth smokers, currently around 3.5 million, could fall by as many as a million.</p>
<p>But he stressed that the numbers are approximate at best, and noted that adult smoking has been falling in recent years while youth smoking has been on the rise.</p>
<p>&quot;Those numbers are in the ballpark but we're still working on estimates of how much a price increase of this size would reduce overall consumption as well as the number of people who smoke,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Where that estimate ends up depends on the penalties, which have the effect of increasing the price beyond 77 cents,&quot; he said. &quot;Also, this is just technically complicated. There has never been a price shock of this maginitude.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton's advisers continue to study the settlement and expect to give him a recommendation shortly after he returns from vacation on Sept. 7, the official said, declining to say when the president might make a decision on the matter.  AMB.N</p>
