<headline>BA still strike-bound, dispute heats up.</headline>

<p>Disruption continued to ground flights and strand thousands of passengers on the second day of a strike by British Airways cabin crew, despite the airline threatening legal action and adding 20 percent more services to those still running.</p>
<p>In a new twist to the spat between management and cabin crew over pay, BA told Reuters it now had 500 new recruits ready to come in to replace striking workers with another 3,000 job applicants in the pipeline.</p>
<p>BA claims the strike over allowances and overtime and its plans to cut 42 million pounds ($70.8 million) from its operating budget is illegal because of a discrepancy in the strike ballot, which it says, balloted more cabin crew than were actually on the company roll.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in active discussion with our lawyers to decide our next action...The T&amp;G (Transport and General Workers Union) replied to our letter (pointing out the discrepancy in balloting), they've disagreed with us but we know this strike is unlawful,&quot; the BA spokesman said.</p>
<p>George Ryde, the union's senior aviation official, told the UK Press Association news agency the union believed its ballot was legal and would be upheld in court if challenged.</p>
<p>Paul Nicholls, an expert on industrial relations at Dibb Lupton Alsop, a UK legal firm, said the British High Court was likely to take a strict view of any discrepancy in strike balloting and could award BA up to 250,000 pounds damages plus costs if the action was successful.</p>
<p>&quot;This (the threat of action) is obviously another weapon that BA is bringing to the negotiating table...But if you have to ask why (BA) hasn't already taken legal action or served an injunction to stop the strike if it's right (about balloting),&quot; Nicholls said in an interview.</p>
<p>As the 72-hour strike, which stranded 25,000 passengers on Wednesday, entered its second day, a BA spokesman said the airline had managed to add to the number of flights it was still operating. BA normally operates around 1,000 flights a day worldwide.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to run 20 percent more flights today and another 20 percent more tomorrow (the last day of the strike),&quot; BA spokesman David Budgen said.</p>
<p>Of its long-haul flights from London Heathrow, BA expects to operate 53 percent of its normal service while on short-haul services it will run 15 percent of flights out of Terminal Four. For short-haul flights from Terminal One it will offer 27 percent of normal service.</p>
<p>At London Gatwick, BA said it had no cancellations to short-haul flights, while it was running half of long-haul services.</p>
<p>The T&amp;G, acting for the British Airways Stewards and Stewardesses Association (BASSA) said there was &quot;solid support&quot; for the second day of the walk-out. The strike is being held over a new pay structure BA has implemented as part of a massive cost-saving drive.</p>
<p>The T&amp;G says it will call another 72-hour strike if no agreement is reached with management. BA says the &quot;ball is firmly in the union's court&quot; regarding the new pay agreement and the plan to save 42 million pounds -- already signed with a breakaway cabin crew union.</p>
<p>The T&amp;G says it is prepared to help the airline find the money, but it was not prepared to have new terms and conditions imposed on its members.</p>
<p>BA said 189 cabin crew had so far gone on strike, while 1,000 cabin crew had reported in for work. Under UK aviation rules, airlines need one member of staff for every 50 passengers.</p>
<p>Another 1,549 cabin crew had reported in sick to date, of which 163 had called in last night to say they would not be coming in to work, rather than admit they were striking for fear of reprisals from the airline.</p>
<p>Management has warned that employees face loss of travel perks and opportunities of promotion if they went on strike. It has also threatened to sack or even sue individual strikers -- tactics which the unions have termed &quot;intimidatory&quot; and &quot;macho&quot;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a decision is expected later today from BA ground staff belonging to the T&amp;G on whether to stage a separate strike in protest at the sale of the airline's catering operation at Heathrow.</p>
<p>The industrial action is part of a war BA is fighting on several fronts. The carrier is striving to get clearance for a massive alliance with American Airlines, while also fighting off a legal challenge from Laker Airway Inc in Florida.</p>
