<p>Burma said on Friday it was confident the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) would decide over the weekend on when to admit it as a new member and would not be swayed by outside interference.</p>
<p>&quot;Myanmar (Burma) is confident that the ASEAN member countries will collectively decide on what is good for the region as a whole...will decide on the future of the region on their own wisdom without giving in to outside interference,&quot; a senior government spokesman told Reuters.  </p>
<p>ASEAN groups Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Brunei and Vietnam. Its foreign ministers meet in Malaysia over the weekend to decide when to admit current observers Burma, Cambodia and Laos into the influential grouping.</p>
<p>But the United States has asked ASEAN to delay Burma's entry because of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council's (SLORC) poor human rights record and suppression of the opposition led by pro-democracy proponent Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p>Diplomats and analysts have speculated that Rangoon's latest swoop on the opposition National League for Democracy ahead of a planned special party gathering and clashes between Buddhists and minority Moslems could persuade the ASEAN ministers to delay Burma's membership in the bloc.</p>
<p>&quot;ASEAN leaders have already proven their wisdom by successfully bringing in nations with different ideologies and religions together to create a strong association in the region,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
