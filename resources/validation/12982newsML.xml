<p>World champion Michael Schumacher of Germany upset the odds and the expected duel between the Williams' top drivers on Sunday when he drove to a brilliant victory in the Belgian Grand Prix.</p>
<p>Schumacher, in a Ferrari, secured his second victory of the season with an astute and well-judged drive on the circuit where he made his Formula One debut in 1991 and claimed his first victory in 1992.</p>
<p>It was the 21st win of his career and prompted emotional celebrations by a vast army of his German fans after he came home 5.6 seconds ahead of Canadian Jacques Villeneuve in a Williams.</p>
<p>In the other Williams, Damon Hill of Britain could finish only fifth and saw his lead over team mate Villeneuve in the world driver's championship cut to 13 points.</p>
<p>Villeneuve, who started from pole position, led through the opening laps but was outmanouvered when the safety car was introduced following an accident involving Arrows' driver Jos Verstappen. </p>
<p>The Dutchman walked away from his car without serious injury although he was later taken to hospital in a neck brace.</p>
<p>Schumacher's quick thinking in making an immediate pitstop was his most decisive move and put him in a position to claim an unexpected victory, his and Ferrari's first since the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona in early June.</p>
<p>Finland's Mika Hakkinen, in a McLaren, came home third 15 seconds behind the Canadian and ahead of Frenchman Jean Alesi in a Benetton. Hill was fifth and Austrian Gerhard Berger who finished sixth for Benetton.</p>
<p>Villeneuve's second place earned him six points and with three races remaining he cut Hill's advantage from 17 to 13 points.</p>
<p>Hill now has 81 points and Villeneuve 68 points. Meanwhile, Schumacher jumped to third in the title race with 39 points although he cannot stop either of the Williams' men succeeding him as champion.</p>
<p>After the race, the German said he had made the important pitstop because his fuel tank was virtually empty and admitted it was stroke of luck. </p>
<p>He added he had suffered no discomfort in the car from his big accident on Friday morning when he bruised his knee severely.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to put into words after being nearly 1.4 seconds behind in qualifying and then so far behind again this morning in the warm-up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I had problems in the middle of the race and was worried about my steering but after making the pitstop, everything was okay.&quot;  </p>
<p>Schumacher added: &quot;After last year (when he won after starting 16th on the grid) I thought that maybe my injury and everything else was a good omen but I still wouldn't have bet a penny on winning this race. It was a stroke of luck.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Ferrari's new seven-speed gearbox had been a great help but refused to be drawn into any predictions of maintaining the Italian team's revival in the next race, their home Grand Prix at Monza.</p>
<p>Villeneuve admitted he was disappointed that he had not been able to reduce Hill's championship lead even further.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a good chance to pile a few points up on Damon, so yes, I'm disappointed,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>&quot;This was because of our miscommunication about the pitstop. I didn't understand what I was being told and didn't come in when I wanted to.&quot;</p>
<p>Hill's race was another disappointment for him and saw his early season grip on the championship loosened further by the combined threat of his own team mate and the Ferrari resurgence.</p>
<p>It was his fourth successive poor start which caused most damage as he lost second position on the grid and found himself fourth at the end of the first lap.</p>
<p>From then on, he was always fighting an uphill battle and his cause suffered further with another badly-timed pitstop when he came in much later than required after the safety car was introduced.</p>
<p>Hill rejoined in 11th place with no chance of winning and, for once, he had to be thankful to his old rival Schumacher for preventing Villeneuve carving even deeper into his championship lead.</p>
