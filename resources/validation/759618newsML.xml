<p>Argentina's industrial output in June was 10.7 percent higher than June 1996, while output for the first half of 1997 was 8.3 percent higher than first-half 1996, the private consultancy FIEL said Monday.</p>
<p>The industrial production figure for June was 3.4 percent down on May, which FIEL said in a statement was &quot;explained almost exclusively by seasonal factors (the lower number of working days).&quot;  </p>
<p>The consultancy said the sharp June-June increase was &quot;the product of a low basis for comparison&quot; since June 1996 was hit by a general strike led by the CGT labor federation which hurt production levels.</p>
<p>FIEL said the second quarter of the year showed an 8.5 percent rise in industrial output on the first quarter, when growth was also high at 8.1 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the fifth consecutive quarter in which the level of activity is higher than the same period the year before,&quot; said FIEL, which was revising preliminary data released last week that showed a 9.9 percent June-to-June output increase.</p>
<p>Government industrial output data released last week showed a 9.8 percent June-to-June increase and a 7.9 percent rise for the first half against first-half 1996. The official data showed a seasonally-adjusted 0.9 percent rise on May and a non seasonally-adjusted 1.4 percent fall from May.</p>
