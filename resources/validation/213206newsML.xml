<p>Francoise Rudetzki has an impressive head for dates -- the day, month, year of guerrilla bombings and shootings branded into the minds of the survivors and victims' families she fights for.</p>
<p>Among them is the night of December 23, 1983, hours before Christmas Eve. As she and her husband strolled out of Paris's chic Grand Vefour restaurant after celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary, a bomb exploded and injured them both.</p>
<p>Rudetzki spent several years in a wheelchair and now walks with crutches. Her husband was less seriously injured. They have yet to be told who set off the bomb.</p>
<p>The association SOS Attentats (Attacks) which she has set up for survivors of guerrilla attacks and close relatives of the dead marks its 10th anniversary this year.</p>
<p>Of its 1,300 members, 300 joined last year, after a wave of attacks by suspected Algerian Moslem fundamentalists in Paris and other cities which killed eight people and injured 180.</p>
<p>Today it waits to hear the truth about TWA Flight 800, which crashed just after take-off from New York last July, killing all 230 people aboard the Paris-bound flight.</p>
<p>&quot;Victims have mobilised and are waging a battle without hatred or desire for vengeance. They are the victims of a new war, but they are all too often forgotten and despised,&quot; said Rudetzki, who looks less than her 46 years.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't mind calling SOS Attacks a pressure group. We put ourselves forward as civil plaintiffs in trials, to give victims a voice and face terrorists who often threaten the jury,&quot; said Rudetzki, a law and political science graduate who lost her job as a company manager after the 1983 bombing.</p>
<p>Her dedication stems partly from the fact that justice failed her on the bomb which injured her. Her social security office told her it had no provision for people like her.</p>
<p>In the decade since the group was set up, funded by voluntary contributions, victims have won rights unmatched in neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>SOS Attacks hires lawyers to represent it as a civil plaintiff in terrorism trials, and it often defends victims on a personal basis and free of charge -- costs are met partly by authorities, including the Justice Ministry.</p>
<p>Jean-Louis Bruguiere, France's chief anti-terrorism investigating magistrate, regularly briefs SOS Attacks members on his progress, showing evidence to his audience and taking their questions.</p>
<p>&quot;The British relatives of victims of the Lockerbie bombing (of a Pan Am Boeing 747) in 1988 have no news of the British probe. When trials take place in France, the victims know what the investigating magistrate has and they are not left out,&quot; said laywer Jean-Paul Levy, who works closely with SOS Attacks.</p>
<p>But when Rudetzki started out on her campaign in the mid-1980s, she was very much preaching in the wilderness.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1985, people thought terrorism was over. It had been a pretty calm year, and politicians couldn't see the point of putting the word &quot;terrorism' into legislation,&quot; Rudetzki said.</p>
<p>&quot;People were willing to make a gesture after an attack, with one-off compensation, but no laws to prepare the future. We said no, we didn't want to have to go begging every time,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>On December 7, 1985, bombs exploded at the Galeries Lafayette and Printemps stores in Paris, wounding 51 people. By the end of 1986, another 14 bombs had exploded, killing 13 and injuring some 200.</p>
<p>Appeals to party leaders ahead of the March 1986 general elections had won pledges from right-wing parties -- and later from Socialist president Francois Mitterrand -- that a special fund would be set up giving victims of terrorism the same status as those wounded in war.</p>
<p>Ten years on, Rudetzki's battle is far from over. She castigates the judicial system for taking too long to resolve investigations, and wants European Union members to drop obstacles to extradition of suspects from and to EU countries, just as border controls were lifted in the single market.</p>
<p>An International Criminal Court should be set up for terrorism investigations, says SOS Attacks, and victims or their relatives should have the right to appeal to it if a state fails to try suspects.</p>
<p>Rudetzki is also lobbying for more resources and training to cope with post-attack trauma.</p>
<p>&quot;For a decade now, I've been calling for better psychological assistance for victims. Studies show they suffer from a type of neurosis common in war.</p>
<p>&quot;The government promised last year that psychologists and psychiatrists would intervene at the scene of a bombing. So far they have only intervened once, and I have yet to see a victim of post-traumatic stress disorder go through treatment and come out cured,&quot; Rudetzki said.</p>
<p>Carole Damiani, a psychologist who treated many of the victims of last year's attacks in France, said she overheard one &quot;veteran&quot; of 1986 bombings telling a more recent survivor in her waiting-room:</p>
<p>&quot;They're taking care of you now. But just wait a few days and nobody will have any time for you any more.&quot;</p>
