<p>Hundreds of pilgrims on Easter Sunday prayed in Jerusalem, the site of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection, but Israeli-Palestinian tensions kept many tourists away from the Holy Land.</p>
<p>&quot;Many evils are surrounding us. The main one is the absence of peace,&quot; Latin Patriarch Michel Sabbah, a Palestinian, said in an Easter message in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;Blood is still unfortunately being shed. Violence is still in the hearts and blindness concerning the rights of others is still in the minds of leaders,&quot; the Roman Catholic leader said.</p>
<p>Sabbah performed Easter mass in Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre as clouds of myrrh wafted above the shrine.</p>
<p>Clouds of teargas hung over parts of the West Bank where clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians protesting against Israeli settlement in Arab East Jerusalem flared for the 11th consecutive day.</p>
<p>In the church, pilgrims from all over the world watched as Arab guards, clad in royal blue embroidered Turkish costumes, tapped silver canes on ancient stones to clear the way for the patriarch's procession.</p>
<p>But crowds were thinner than on past Easter holidays and most Palestinian shops were shuttered in East Jerusalem in support of an annual Israeli Arab protest against expropriation of land by the government.</p>
<p>&quot;Tourists stayed away this year because of the tensions,&quot; Wajeeh Nusseibeh, Moslem custodian and doorkeeper of the Christian shrine, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Industry officials say tourism is down 15 to 18 percent during the peak season around Easter and Passover, the Jewish holiday next month marking the biblical exodus from Egypt.</p>
<p>Analysts attribute the slump to a wave of Islamist suicide bombings that killed 59 last year and fierce Israeli-Palestinian gunbattles in September that affected advance bookings for the two holidays.</p>
<p>The new flareup has done little to ease the anxieties of potential visitors.</p>
<p>But pilgrims who came despite the troubles shrugged off the tension.</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus died and was resurrected here for our sins,&quot; Keith Phillips, from England, told Reuters. &quot;I need to be here because we need him more than ever.&quot;</p>
<p>Sabbah blasted an Israeli closure of the West Bank, tightened after a Moslem militant killed three Israeli women in a Tel Aviv suicide bombing nine days ago, for preventing Palestinian Christians from entering Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;The holy city, the place of all the holy events ... is still the main cause for the absence of peace,&quot; Sabbah said. &quot;It is still for security reasons forbidden for our believers.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Jerusalem, claimed by Israel as its eternal and indivisible capital, should have a &quot;unique and special status&quot; guaranteeing its holiness and sovereignty.</p>
<p>&quot;Sharing the city is the only way to peace,&quot; Sabbah said.</p>
