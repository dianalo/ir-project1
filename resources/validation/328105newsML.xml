<p>Philips Electronics NV said on Thursday it planned to cut a minority stake in semiconductor equipment maker ASM Lithography Holding NV in a move which could raise around 400 million guilders ($217 million).</p>
<p>Separately, ASM Lithography reported that 1996 net earnings jumped 66 percent to 217.7 million guilders from 131.4 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Philips intends to offer 3,950,000 ordinary shares...in an international offering,&quot; ASML and Philips said in a joint statement accompanying ASML's results.</p>
<p>A Philips spokesman denied the planned sale was part of chairman Cor Boonstra's strategy to weed out loss-making and underperforming &quot;bleeders&quot; from Europe's largest electronic group.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's move is absolutely not part of the bleeders strategy because ASML makes good profits,&quot; said Ben Geerts.</p>
<p>Since Boonstra announced his strategy in October, Philips has announced a string of changes, including moving to a passive minority shareholding in German consumer electronics firm Grundig, cutting back head office staff and winding up its Superclub home entertainments business.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse First Boston will co-ordinate the sale of the ASML shares which will bring Philips' 35 percent holding down to 24 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It is expected that the pricing of the shares will be announced on January 30,&quot; Geerts said, declining to give further details.</p>
<p>&quot;Philips will use the proceeds of its offering for general corporate purposes. ASML will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares by Philips,&quot; the two firms said.</p>
<p>Geerts said the offering would be the third sale of ASML shares since 1995, when it cut its 100 percent stake to around 55 percent. It followed that with another cut in 1996, but has a commitment to keep its stake at 24 percent until March 2000.</p>
<p>Geerts said the 1995 sale raised a net 260 million guilders and the sale in 1996 netted 415 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The offer is part of the strategy formulated by Philips when we first floated part of our stake in 1995. We said at the time that producing equipment for the semiconductor industry was not our core business.&quot;</p>
<p>ASML said in its results statement that profits soared because of rises in the volume of sales and average selling prices from 1995.</p>
<p>The rise in ASM Lithography's 1996 earnings was at the lower end of analysts' forecasts of 210-241 million guilders.</p>
<p>ASM Lithography also announced plans for a two-for-one share split, saying it would seek shareholder approval for the move at its annual shareholders meeting on April 3.</p>
<p>Presenting the results, ASML chief executive Willem Maris told a news conference the company increased market share to an estimated 19 percent in 1996, up from 17 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;We've won market share,&quot; Maris told reporters. &quot;Our strategic target is 1/3 of the market and second position (up from a current third) in the market place.&quot; He declined to give a timeframe.</p>
<p>The company, which has a dual listing on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and U.S. Nasdaq, said that after last year's slowdown in the semiconductor industry the outlook for the first half of 1997 was &quot;moderate&quot; but could pick up in the second.</p>
<p>&quot;While we expect that the first half of 1997 will be consistent with the moderate forecast of the semiconductor equipment industry, we anticipate that demand for semiconductor equipment may strengthen in the second half,&quot; ASM Litho said.</p>
<p>Sales rose to 1.33 billion guilders from 920 million.</p>
<p>On the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, ASM Lithography shares opened a guilder lower on the news at 110.00. They fell heavily to 104.00 in the first 90 minutes of trade, but later rallied to be five guilders down at 106.00 guilders. ($1=1.843 Guilder)</p>
