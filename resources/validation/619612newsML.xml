<p>Laurent Kabila's finance minister said on Wednesday the Democratic Republic of Congo would replace the new zaire with a new currency to be called the congolese franc and would print no new bank notes until it is introduced.</p>
<p>Mawampanga Mwanananga also said that the government would set up special commissions to audit its hefty internal and external debt as a prelude to informal talks and then a conference with the country's creditors.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a long road ahead of us. There will be big decisions to take. Some of these decisions will be tough but there is no choice,&quot; he told reporters after receiving a report from a working party on monetary and banking reform.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important that the outside world knows that we are ready to make sacrifices to relaunch our economy.&quot;</p>
<p>The minister gave no timing for the currrency switch, one of many planned in the former Zaire following the civil war victory of Kabila's Alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;Monetary reform is conducted to the surprise of everyone to avoid speculation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and successive governments under him printed money whenever they needed it, fuelling hyper-inflation which topped 8,000 percent in 1993.</p>
<p>Reforms under prime minister Kengo wa Dondo, who cracked down on some of the wilder excesses, managed to decrease inflation to treble figures winning plaudits from foreign economic partners. But the war put paid to reform.</p>
<p>At one stage during the war Zaire had three currency zones with different versions of the zaire trading at different rates.</p>
<p>The new zaire currently trades at 120,000 to the U.S. dollar on the parallel market in the capital Kinshasa.</p>
<p>The government fixed the official rate last Friday at 125,000. It plans to fix the rate every Friday.</p>
<p>Mawampanga told reporters that once the government knew what the country owed, and to whom, it wanted to sit down with creditors for informal talks on the way forward.</p>
<p>&quot;We have inherited a debt estimated at $14 billion,&quot; he said. &quot;I do not think that we have precise figures on what we owe and to whom.&quot;</p>
<p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire, is potentially one of Africa's richest country with reserves of copper, cobalt, gold, diamonds and other minerals plus considerable farming and hydroelectric power potential.</p>
<p>It built up its foreign debt under ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled for over three decades. The economy collapsed under the weight of rampant official corruption and administrative chaos.</p>
<p>It was borrowing late into the 1980s but stopped repayments on virtually all its debts in 1992. In 1994, the World Bank closed its Kinshasa office and the International Monetary Fund suspended Zaire's membership the same year.</p>
<p>Mawampanga made no comment on payment of the debts but one option proposed by the seminar was the conversion of debt into negotiable instruments.</p>
<p>&quot;A commission will be set up to conduct an audit of the internal debt so that we know what we owe and under what circumstances,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;For the foreign debt, we must continue working in the same way because there is a Paris Club, the London Club and bilateral debt. We must also be able to continue our audit exercise.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the audit would be a starting point. &quot;It would be good to know what scope we have for negotiating with the others,&quot; he said. &quot;We will probably have to start with preliminary contacts with different institutions before going to a conference.&quot;</p>
<p>The commissions, he added, could include legal experts, people from the Central Bank, the state debt management office and the business association.</p>
<p>Mawampanga also pledged to reform the banking sector, with the Central Bank reverting to its long lost supervisory role.</p>
