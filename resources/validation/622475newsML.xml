<p>The Association Cambiste Internationale (ACI), the trade association for the huge global foreign exchange market, kicked off its 39th annual gathering here on Thursday determined to overhaul its image.</p>
<p>&quot;We're now in the process of transforming ACI,&quot; ACI President Eugene Prim told reporters.</p>
<p>The top item on the agenda of the ACI governing council was an initial study on future development covering everything from the ACI's purpose to how to market its name and how the organisation should be structured.  </p>
<p>The completed study will be reviewed in January 1998.</p>
<p>Despite the huge daily volumes of the forex maket, which at last count exceeded $1 trillion a day, this over-the- counter market is largely unregulated in many countries.</p>
<p>As a result, the centrepiece of the ACI's future plans will be training and education programs.</p>
<p>&quot;If we were the automobile industry, we'd be looking at things like emissions. If we were the aircraft industry, we'd be looking at things like safety. What do you do if you're the trade association of the foreign exchange and money markets?&quot; said David Clark, honourary ACI president.  </p>
<p>Clark said countries connected with the ACI overwhelmingly wanted the body to provide education and training and set codes of conduct and practise. The ACI Institute was set up in 1994 for this very purpose.</p>
<p>&quot;In most countries...you have to have a licence to deal. We have never had a licence to deal, even though we may be moving that way.&quot; said Clark.</p>
<p>&quot;First, however, the strength and depth of that market depends on the quality of the people in it.&quot;  </p>
<p>The ACI, which represents about 24,000 individual members from over 60 countries, has appointed Bill Hahn as business director in charge of the overall review.</p>
<p>When the ACI was formed in the 1950s, it was mainly a social forum for telephone-based traders to meet each other. But now, the market's size and technological complexity, as well as the increased sophistication of its products, requires that it plays a different role.</p>
<p>Hahn's initial report said the ACI should re-emphasize its international role, for example, by harmonizing the names of local associations with that of the global organisation.  </p>
<p>The report also called for broader membership to include new market participants like hedge funds and electronic brokers. But it was wary about changing the basis of memberhip from individual to corporate because it would increase vulnerability to cost-cutting and might deter smaller firms with high membership fees.</p>
<p>The report said marketing could be improved by lobbying for more recognition from institutions such as central banks and altering the organisation's structure to be able to speak with one voice on industry issues.</p>
<p>Other suggestions involved standardising training and examinations and boosting its internal image with more publications and an annual report.</p>
