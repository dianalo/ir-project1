<p>World number two Michael Chang took a long, winding road out of Wimbledon on Tuesday as the men's draw waved goodbye to a quarter of its seeded contenders at the first hurdle.</p>
<p>An extraordinary final set fightback from 5-1 down to 6-5 ahead almost saved Chang from the chop against Australian Todd Woodbridge, but his eventual 7-6 3-6 6-2 3-6 8-6 defeat merely reflected the trend elsewhere.</p>
<p>French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten also lost in five sets to American Justin Gimelstob, fancied seventh seed Mark Philippoussis was unable to claw back his overnight deficit against Greg Rusedski and another Briton, Chris Wilkinson, proved too tough for Swede Jonas Bjorkman.</p>
<p>With Jim Courier and Pat Cash, both former grand slam champions, also biting the dust, it further emphasised the holes now appearing at the forefront of the men's game.</p>
<p>For various reasons, only six of the world's top 16 are still in contention with just one round gone, and had Australian Pat Rafter not struggled back from two sets down, none of the four semifinalists at this month's French Open would have been present in the second round at the All England Club.</p>
<p>This sort of crazy form guide is becoming the norm, even in the traditional environment of Wimbledon where only a retrospective decision that defending champion Richard Krajicek should be regarded as a seed prevented the first all-unseeded final last year.</p>
<p>Chang's demise, though, could not be described as the biggest shock of all time given his past record on grass.</p>
<p>The fifth seed has now won only one match at Wimbledon in three years, yet will reflect on his three hour 54 minute contest against Woodbridge as one he should have won.</p>
<p>He had outlasted the same opponent in five sets in their first meeting in the second round of Wimbledon in 1993, and appeared to have Woodbridge on the ropes after the Australian doubles specialist, ranked 37th in the world, had watched a huge lead disintegrate in the closing stages.</p>
<p>The American even saved four break points before scrambling into the lead at 6-5, only for Woodbridge to rediscover his range and avoid what would also have been his second successive first round defeat.</p>
<p>&quot;I would rate that the biggest win of my career,&quot; said Woodbridge. &quot;The only other times I've managed to play on Centre Court, I've always come up against former champions and I've lost.&quot;</p>
<p>Chang, who played with his right knee strapped after slipping at Rosmalen last week, was typically phlegmatic afterwards. &quot;It's a little bit disappointing, but I have the rest of the season to look forward to.&quot;</p>
<p>On a day when four other Australians -- Jason Stoltenberg, Todd Larkham, Sandon Stolle and Mark Woodforde -- scored good wins, it was ironic that Philippoussis should among those heading for the exit.</p>
<p>He lasted only 14 more minutes as Rusedski completed a 7-6 7-6 6-3 win to register an emphatic victory in the shoot-out between the two fastest recorded servers in tennis.</p>
<p>&quot;If he goes on serving like that in his other matches, who knows how far he can go,&quot; said the Australian. Rusedski, ranked 27th in the world, now meets American Jonathan Stark.</p>
<p>It was ironic that Wilkinson should join the Canadian-born left-hander in the winners' circle as the former made himself unavailable to play Davis Cup in protest at what he saw as Rusedski's calculated switch of nationality two years ago.</p>
<p>His 7-6 0-6 5-7 6-3 6-4 win, though, came against an opponent who beat Pete Sampras less than a fortnight ago and, with Tim Henman already through, Britain's profile is now rising fast.</p>
<p>The U.S. contingent, in contrast, are experiencing slim pickings, despite top seed Pete Sampras's easy 6-4 6-4 6-2 outing against Swede Mikael Tillstrom.</p>
<p>Courier, for example, has won only two matches in four visits since he reached the final in 1993, Andre Agassi remains conspicuous by his absence and recent hopefuls MaliVai Washington and Todd Martin are also missing.</p>
<p>Courier's conqueror Michael Stich, champion in 1991 but retiring this year, will test American resolve further when he meets Gimelstob in the second round,</p>
