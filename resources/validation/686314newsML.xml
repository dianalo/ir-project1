<p>The scientists in Scotland who cloned Dolly the sheep have been approached by two families seeking to use the technique to produce exact genetic copies of relatives, the team's leader said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He made it clear the two requests had been rejected. &quot;I can't think of any embryologist I know who would be interested in cloning a human being,&quot; Dr. Ian Wilmut told a news conference at the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
<p>&quot;One inquiry was from a lady shortly to lose her father and the other was from a couple who lost their daughters in an automobile accident,&quot; he explained, without saying where the requests had come from.</p>
<p>Despite fears that the idea of cloning an existing human being from his or her DNA might take hold among the bereaved, the famous, or the scientifically curious, Wilmut said those were the only two inquiries he had received.</p>
<p>Wilmut and his team amazed the world when they announced in February that they had cloned a lamb -- which they named Dolly -- from a single cell taken from an adult sheep.</p>
<p>Their success was so controversial, raising the prospect that the procedure could be used to make humans genetically identical to an existing man or woman, that President Bill Clinton almost immediately appointed a commission of scientists, lawyers and theologians to review the legal and ethical ramifications of cloning.</p>
<p>The group was faced with trying to reconcile the views of opponents of cloning who regard it as an affront to nature and demand a complete ban, and supporters who see it as a stunning scientific breakthgrough with promising medical repercussions.</p>
<p>Their solution was to propose a five-year ban on cloning a human being, but to allow the cloning of human embryos for private laboratory research. Clinton proposed legislation embodying those recommendations on June 9.</p>
<p>Wilmut said he fully supported Clinton's plan.</p>
<p>&quot;I share the concern, almost universal, that this technique should not be misused ... it should not be used to produce a copy of a person who is already here,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Wilmut and Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, associate professor of medical ethics at Harvard Medical School, acknowledged rumours -- which they said they could not substantiate -- that some people had expressed keen interest in cloning a human.</p>
<p>&quot;The reasons should be obvious -- being first, the money,&quot; Emanuel told the AAAS news conference.</p>
<p>As for Dolly, Wilmut said the sheep was perfectly healthy and would be given a chance to breed in the fall.</p>
<p>&quot;I have nothing to report. She's in no way different from any other sheep,&quot; he added.</p>
