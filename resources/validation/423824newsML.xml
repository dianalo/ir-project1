<p>Guyana's president, Cheddi Jagan, died of apparent heart problems on Thursday at Walter Reed military hospital in Washington, his wife and family by his side. He was 78.</p>
<p>Jagan had undergone heart surgery to clear a blocked artery after being taken to the United States for medical treatment Feb. 15, complaining of chest pains.</p>
<p>&quot;That extraordinary light that shone in Guyana and the world for nearly 79 years has been extinguished,&quot; Guyana's Prime Minister, Samuel Hinds, said in a statement read on radio and television.</p>
<p>&quot;The greatest son and patriot that has ever walked this land has departed,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Information Minister Moses Nagamootoo told Reuters that Hinds, who has been acting president since Jagan became ill, would be sworn in as president later on Thursday.</p>
<p>Jagan's wife, two children and five grandchildren had rushed to his bedside to hold an all-night vigil.</p>
<p>He returned to power in Guyana after nearly three decades in the political wilderness and was the driving force in putting the former British colony back in the Caribbean mainstream.</p>
<p>The former Marxist led his left-leaning People's Progressive Party (PPP) to a striking victory at the polls in October 1992 -- the country's first democratic elections in 28 years.</p>
<p>Under his rule, Guyana enjoyed a relative economic boom.</p>
<p>He steered Guyana toward what some experts called one of the most successful adjustment programmes anywhere, including a 1996 agreement to reduce by 67 percent the country's debt with the Paris Club of creditor nations.</p>
<p>From a high 105 percent in 1989, inflation fell to 4.5 percent in 1996 as the country opened to foreign investors eager to tap vast resources in mining, forestry and agriculture.</p>
<p>The author of a wealth of books on Caribbean history, Jagan became Guyana's first prime minister after the former British colony was granted self-government in 1961, only to be deposed three years later after race riots.</p>
<p>A frequent visitor of communist Cuba, he antagonized Washington and became a target of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p>His ouster meant his long-time rival, Forbes Burnham, would lead the country out of colonial rule in 1966 and his People's National Congress (PNC) rule with an iron fist for the next 26 years with a mix of state control and socialist experiments.</p>
<p>Jagan was born on March 22, 1918 in Port Mourant, and qualified as a dentist in the United States, where he married Janet Rosenberg of Chicago, a relative of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, who were executed in 1953 for espionage.</p>
<p>He returned to Guyana in 1943 and practiced dentistry for a few years before forming the PPP in 1948 together with Burnham.</p>
<p>He first headed an elected PPP government in 1953, but six months later Britain suspended the Constitution charging communist subversion and Jagan was imprisoned for six months.</p>
<p>Jagan was awarded the Lenin centenary medal and the Soviet Union's order of peace and friendship among peoples.</p>
<p>Among his many literary works is &quot;The Role of the CIA in Guyana and its Activities Throughout the World,&quot; published in 1967, which did not endear him to Washington.</p>
<p>Operating out of a ramshackle timber building in downtown Georgetown, overflowing with Marxist literature and posters, Jagan kept his party alive as a force in Guyana politics, finally returning to power but to find a bankrupt country.</p>
<p>During the 1992 election campaign, he promised to try to combine foreign investment with a high priority on &quot;human development.&quot;</p>
<p>Jagan's party represents much of the Asian majority -- descendants of indentured labourers brought from India in the 19th century -- yet he chose Hinds, a black executive in the bauxite industry, as his running mate and eventual Prime Minister</p>
