<title>USA: Continental seeks to expand int'l alliances.</title>
<headline>Continental seeks to expand int'l alliances.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-18</dateline>

<p>Continental Airlines Inc Chief Executive Gordon Bethune said Wednesday the carrier was still in talks aimed at broadening its agreement with Alitalia and forming an alliance with Air France.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking to expand our international alliance presence,&quot; Bethune said in an interview with Reuters. &quot;There's a couple of air carriers who believe we now make a good partner, where perhaps two years ago we wouldn't have had the quality and reliability,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Continental, which has become profitable after teetering on the brink of a repeated bankruptcy just two years ago, may announce an expanded pact with Alitalia within the next 30 days, Bethune said.</p>
<p>While the international alliances would allow Continental to broaden its reach, the deals would not significantly boost revenues, he said. The international sector comprises only about 20 percent of Continental's business.</p>
<p>&quot;Our revenue is going to grow because of our growth here, domestically,&quot; Bethune said.  </p>
<p>Bethune said he expected the Houston-based carrier to grow internationally by up to eight percent this year, and by up to three percent domestically.</p>
<p>Although some industry experts said the carrier was positioned for even faster growth, Bethune said the company would grow in a &quot;measured way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I really want to be reliable for our shareholders,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bethune said he was comfortable with the First Call consensus earnings estimate of $1.35 a share for the third quarter, compared with $1.34 a share in the 1995 quarter.  </p>
<p>Continental's third quarter benefited in part from strong summer travel demand and an investment that shielded the airline from rising oil costs, Bethune said.</p>
<p>While some rival airlines have warned that rising fuel costs may squeeze their profit margins, Continental said it was not affected because of a previous investment in oil futures.</p>
<p>The airline said its fuel costs have been capped at $0.62 a gallon, while market prices have risen as high as $0.70 a gallon during the past week.  </p>
<p>Rising fuel costs &quot;are not going to hit our earnings,&quot; Bethune said.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts have cut their earnings estimates for other U.S.-based carriers, such as Southwest Airlines Co, because of rising fuel costs.</p>
<p>Continental continues to examine options for its fleet and may replace its old DC-9 and 737 aircraft instead of modifying them to meet federal noise-reduction requirements, Bethune said.</p>
<p>&quot;We had it in our plans to modify these planes. But we may be able to replace them for less money,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A move to replace those aircraft, coupled with a previously announced plan to retire its fleet of Boeing 727s, would reduce the average age of Continental's aircraft to about eight years from 13 years, Bethune said.</p>
<p>That would put Continental's fleet age well below the industry average of about 11.9 years.</p>
