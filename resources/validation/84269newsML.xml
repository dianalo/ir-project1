<p>U.S. spot gasoline took a drubbing by late Monday as heat edged marginally higher tracking NYMEX futures ahead of the expiry of the October products' contracts at today's close, traders said.</p>
<p>Most gasoline grades fell between 1.65 cents and 1.85 cents in both centers amid narrowly mixed differentials, players said, erasing every bit of Friday's strong gains.</p>
<p>Many traders last week predicted gasoline might continue to benefit from the continuing switchover by refiners from gasoline to maximum distillate production ahead of winter.</p>
<p>&quot;It didn't happen today and I don't expect much of a dead-cat bounce tomorrow,&quot; one East Coast trader said, adding gasoline would be lucky to hold its own.</p>
<p>Traders also blamed gasoline's softness on perceptions that inventories are more-than-adequate, particularly since the peak demand season has past.</p>
<p>Prompt New York Harbor A4-grade reformulated gasoline was was pegged 1.10 cents below October futures, with November material talked at 1.25 cents under -- stable with Friday.</p>
<p>Heating oil was stable in both centers amid steady diffs and slighty firmer October futures, traders said.</p>
