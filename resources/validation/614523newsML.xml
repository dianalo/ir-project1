<p>June notionnel futures on the MATIF should begin to form a short term base around 128.20 on Monday, and may be capable of a slight bounce from there towards 128.80, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>But holidays in the UK and the U.S. mean trade will likely be thin, reducing the chances of any upside move.</p>
<p>&quot;The June contract in my opinion should form a good base around 128.20 and we should see a nice rebound to 128.80, 129.00 before attempting further losses,&quot; said Christian Bado, senior technical analyst at Ferrier Lullin in Geneva.  </p>
<p>By 0842 GMT, the June notionnel was down 46 basis points at 128.54, knocked by the first round of French parliamentary elections in which the combined left outpolled the centre-right. The contract hit an earlier low of 128.22.</p>
<p>Bado suggested selling the contract around the 128.80, 129.00 level as the market would soon fall back again.</p>
<p>He said on a one to two week view, the contract would try to move down towards 127.10, the full retracement of the upmove from April to mid May.</p>
<p>Dominique Barbet from Paribas in Paris also put support for the market at 128.20 and another one at 128.00.  </p>
<p>&quot;The level in notionnel should be pretty stable now, especially given the market in London is closed so there's no impetus from there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Barbet said the market may rebound to 128.68 at the most. &quot;But that may need some kind of improvement in Germany and with the UK and the U.S. closed, there's little chance of that happening,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>By 0846 GMT, June Pibor was down 17 basis points at 96.30. One European analyst said such a move below 96.45, the low on Friday, signalled a failure of strength and a possible retest of further lows.</p>
