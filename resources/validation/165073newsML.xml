<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates end down, spots mixed.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1996-11-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mostly down on Monday due to a weak market trend on the domestic A share markets over the past few sessions, traders said.</p>
<p>But early-maturing contracts edged down while remaining at high levels due to two new listings on the Shanghai's A share market on Monday and Tuesday, they said. Petroleum Long Chang (Group) Co was listed on Monday and Qinghai Tongren Aluminium Industrial will make debut on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most active seven-day contract edged down to 11.65 percent from 11.70 percent last Friday.  </p>
<p>Combined turnover of the six-contract market rose to 8.25 million lots from 7.92 million.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>&quot;Some big institutions have reduced their borrowing on the repo market since the A share market began to show signs of weakness late last week,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, some institutions borrowed money last week to prepare for new issues and listings this week,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Traders said the rates were likely to move up in the next few days.</p>
