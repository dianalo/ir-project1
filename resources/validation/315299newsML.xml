<title>USA: Conrail stockholders reject CSX merger plan.</title>
<headline>Conrail stockholders reject CSX merger plan.</headline>

<p>Shareholders of Conrail Inc. Friday voted against a measure crucial to the railroad's planned $9.3 billion merger with CSX Inc., rival bidder Norfolk Southern Corp. said.</p>
<p>Conrail Chairman David LeVan said Conrail would schedule a new shareholder vote. He did not specify a date.</p>
<p>&quot;We will reschedule the meeting. We will move on. We have to get out and sell the value of this transaction,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Officer David Goode said at least 53 percent of Conrail's outstanding shares were voted against the measure.</p>
<p>LeVan had insisted before the vote that the Philadelphia-based railroad was committed to its proposed merger with CSX despite a higher, hostile offer from Norfolk Southern.</p>
<p>Conrail has repeatedly rejected Norfolk Southern's $10.3 billion bid, saying that CSX's offer provides more benefits.</p>
<p>&quot;The Conrail board has determined that a sale to Norfolk Southern is not in the best interests of Conrail, and the Conrail board will not agree to a sale to Norfolk Southern,&quot; LeVan said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Conrail shareholders meeting.</p>
<p>LeVan said Conrail's board was not swayed by a proposal by Norfolk Southern to buy 9.9 percent of the company if shareholders defeated the measure, which was critical to the CSX union.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope you all understand the Conrail board is fully committed to the CSX-Conrail merger and, regardless of speculation to the contrary, there can be no transaction with Norfolk Southern until 1999 at the earliest,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The proposed merger pact between Conrail and CSX prohibits either party, should their pact fail, from merging with another company until 1999.</p>
