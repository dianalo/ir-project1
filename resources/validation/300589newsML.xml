<p>Nisseki House Industry Co Ltd said on Friday that it would issue 9.65 billion yen worth of shares to Kotobuki Industry Co Ltd, three other firms and individuals on January 31 to improve its financial stability.</p>
<p>Nisseki House will issue 50 million new shares, the company said in a statement, with some of the money to be used for operating funds.</p>
<p>The company, which makes prefabricated houses, said it needed to improve its financial situation because it posted a pre-tax loss for the first time in 15 years in the half year to September 30.</p>
<p>The company also announced on Friday that it had dismissed its missing president Saburo Horiuchi.</p>
<p>The company said the last time it was in contact with Horiuchi was on December 11. Nisseki said it does not know what has happened to Horiuchi.</p>
<p>Because of his disappearence, Nisseki created a vice president post on December 30 and filled it with managing director Yuji Horiuchi, Saburo Horiuchi's son.  </p>
<p>After the disappearance of Saburo Horiuchi, the president's post will be vacant for the time being, a company official said in a news conference.</p>
<p>Nisseki also revised downward its earnings forecast for the year ending March 31 due to the intensifying price competition.</p>
<p>But Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd, which has close business ties with Nisseki House, said in a separate statement that it would be ready to offer more support to the company than before and that it expected Nisseki House's business to improve soon.  </p>
<p>The bank said it had arranged the equity tie-up between Nisseki House and the Ono group which comprises Kotobuki, the three other firms and three individuals.</p>
<p>Nisseki House asked the bank to quickly find partners who could offer support to help Nisseki House erase recent worries over its business and improved its financial health, the bank said.</p>
<p>Nisseki House shares continued to slump on the Tokyo stock market this week due to sales prompted by uncertainty over its management following Horiuchi's disappearence.  </p>
<p>As a result, the Ono group would own a 34 percent stake in Nisseki House, the Nisseki official told reporters.</p>
<p>Nisseki House now expects 1996/97 sales to total 61 billion yen, down from 69 billion yen as previously forecast on November 18. Its parent current loss is now expected at 9.1 billion, compared with the previous forecast of 1.6 billion yen.</p>
<p>Because of media reports on the disappearence, construction of more than 100 houses had been temporarily suspended or postponed, the Nisseki official said.</p>
<p>Accumulated losses from business in China has totalled 8.4 billion yen, of which 4.3 billion yen will be handled by loan loss reserves in the current business year, he said, without elaborating on the nature of its business in China.</p>
<p>On Friday, Nisseki shares ended at 203 yen, down 10 yen.</p>
