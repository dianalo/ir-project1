<title>USA: Sprint wins PCS licenses in 139 markets.</title>
<headline>Sprint wins PCS licenses in 139 markets.</headline>

<p>Sprint Corp said Tuesday it won the rights to personal communications services (PCS) licenses in 139 markets in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction of wireless licenses.</p>
<p>Sprint said it bid $545 million in the auction, paying an average of $7.78 per person for each 10-megaHertz license.</p>
<p>Sprint said it projects build-out costs over three years of $1.5 billion. Costs associated with the licenses and build-out are expected to hurt earnings over the next few years, with peak dilution in 1998, Sprint said.  </p>
<p>The build-out of many of the markets will begin immediately and take 12 to 14 months to complete, Sprint said. Other markets will be built out over a longer timeframe.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the long-term economic value created by Sprint PCS will far outweigh the start-up costs Sprint will incur,&quot; Bill Esrey, Sprint chairman, said in a statement. &quot;Additionally, we believe the investment in a seamless, nationwide PCS network will pay off handsomely in the future as PCS becomes the universal standard for wireless communications in the United States.&quot;  </p>
<p>Sprint said the licenses reach a total population of 70 million in cities across the contiguous United States and Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>The communications company said it bid in the latest auction with the objective to affiliate the new licenses with Sprint PCS. Sprint PCS is a joint venture of Sprint, Tele-Communications Inc, Cox Communications Inc and Comcast Corp.</p>
<p>Sprint said this partnership and its affiliates have licenses to provide PCS service to an aggregate population of 190 million people.  </p>
<p>With the new licenses, Sprint PCS will reach nearly 260 million people.</p>
<p>Sprint PCS has launched service in eight markets, including Spokane, Wash., Milwaukee, Wis., Fresno and San Diego, Calif., Portland, Ore., Albany and Syracuse, N.Y., and Pittsburgh, Pa.</p>
<p>&quot;The remaining markets, including New York, San Francisco, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Boston, Miami, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Denver, Seattle and Kansas City, will launch on a market-by-market basis in the first half of 1997,&quot; Andrew Sukawaty, Sprint PCS chief executive officer, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;When this first phase of launch is completed this year, Sprint PCS service will be available in 65 cities, including 35 of the top 50 U.S. markets,&quot; he added. &quot;The addition of the new Sprint-acquired licenses will allow us to offer the many benefits of Sprint PCS to consumers and businesses in every metropolitan area including Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Houston and Tampa.&quot;</p>
