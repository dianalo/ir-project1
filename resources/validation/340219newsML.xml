<title>CANADA: WCE canola ends steady-up on CBOT gain.</title>
<headline>WCE canola ends steady-up on CBOT gain.</headline>
<dateline>WINNIPEG 1997-01-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>WCE canola futures closed steady to higher, partially supported by gains in CBOT soybean futures, traders said. Feed grains closed slightly lower on anticipation of hedge selling.</p>
<p>Also featured in canola was buying of March futures at $410 and March $410 call options, which sources said would be a profitable trade. Canola traders also traded new-crop crush spreads by buying September and November canola and selling deferred CBOT soyoil futures.</p>
<p>Canola closed unchanged to up $1.50 per ton with March unchanged at $409.20.</p>
<p>Flaxseed was lightly traded with speculative selling against light commercial buying. Flaxseed closed down $3.00 to unchanged with March off the most at $351.20.</p>
<p>Wheat and barley futures ended down pressured by warmer weather in the Prairies. Warm weather should prompt greater grain movement as farmers will be more willing to load trucks.</p>
<p>Wheat ended down $0.50 to steady with March off the most at $170.20 a tonne.</p>
<p>Barley fell C$0.80 to C$0.20 with February off C$0.40 at C$138.70. March oats closed up US$0.50 at US$120.00 and February feed peas fell US$1.00 to US$207.00.</p>
<p>(Late Wednesday the Canadian dollar was at C$1.3454).</p>
<p>(All values in Canadian dollars/tonne except peas, oats)</p>
