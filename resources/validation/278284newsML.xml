<p>NWE oil products stagnated in practically non-existent trade on Friday with many players away from the market due to the Christmas break, traders said.</p>
<p>Outright gas oil prices were pulled higher by modest gains in benchmark IPE futures. January gas oil futures were trading $2.50 higher at $218.00 a tonne at 1038 GMT.</p>
<p>A heating oil barge was reported sold at screen flat for December delivery.</p>
<p>Brokers assessed premiums at Jan IPE -50/+50 cents for prompt delivery and Jan IPE flat/$1 for first half January delivery, but some sellers said, given the arctic conditions across much of Europe, they would hold out for higher premiums.</p>
<p>Brokers in the high sulphur fuel oil barge market said they had heard nothing traded so far.</p>
<p>One broker assessed high sulphur fuel oil barge prices at $111-112/$115 a tonne fob ARA but said he was expecting very little action throughout the day.</p>
<p>The gasoline market was similarly dead. No trade and very little talk was heard. The last Eurograde barge deal reported on Tuesday was done at $219 a tonne.</p>
