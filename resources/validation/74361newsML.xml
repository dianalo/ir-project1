<headline>Stocks, bonds, dollar end higher.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Blue-chip stocks rose slightly Wednesday as bonds and high-technology shares jumped a day after the Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates steady.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 3.33 points at 5,877.36.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,298 to 1,033 on active volume of 451 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;Technology is doing well and bonds are doing very well. But there's still some caution. People are not rushing head-long into the market,&quot; said Hildegard Zagorski, an analyst at Prudential Securities.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond rose 23/32, or $7.19 per $1,000 face value, and its yield fell to 6.93 percent from 6.99 percent at Tuesday's close. The bond's yield was at 7.02 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>The Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee voted Tuesday to hold interest rates steady, surprising stock traders, who had expected an increase of at least one-quarter percentage point in the key federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans.</p>
<p>The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose 9.39 points to 1,224.66 in a rally fuelled by unexpectedly strong quarterly earnings from computer networking company 3Com Corp.</p>
<p>Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp., said the market also focused on earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;Defensive industry groups are performing better than economically sensitive, aside from technology,&quot; he said. &quot;On the plus side we have banks, food stocks and household products -- those whose earnings tend to do well if the economy slows. On the negative side, autos and retailers.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar late Wednesday rose to 1.5167 German marks from 1.5015 at Tuesday's close and to 110.49 Japanese yen from 109.07.</p>
<p>Heating oil prices soared to post-Gulf War highs as speculators bought heavily on concern that the United States and other big consumers were short of supplies heading into the winter.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange, October heating oil rose 2.08 cents a gallon to close at 71.77 cents, matching the post-Gulf War high set on Nov. 8, 1991.</p>
<p>October crude oil closed up 39 cents a barrel at $24.46 and October unleaded gasoline rose 0.27 cent to 63.10 cents a gallon, buoyed by the speculative buying in heating oil.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Board of Trade, cold, wet weather fed worries that late maturing corn and soybeans in the Midwest would be damaged and planting of winter wheat would be delayed further.</p>
<p>November soybeans closed up 4-1/2 cents per bushel at $7.95-3/4 and December corn up 1-3/4 cents per bushel at $3.12-1/4. July 1997 wheat rose 1 cent to $3.89 per bushel.</p>
<p>At the Commodity Exchange in New York, December gold ended down 40 cents at $385.30 an ounce and December silver ended down 1.3 cents at $4.922 amid fears about possible gold sales by producer nations and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 closed up 25.2 points at 3,935.7. In Tokyo, the key Nikkei 225 average gained 178.68 points or 0.84 percent to close at 21,350.67.</p>
