<p>Peruvian leftist guerrillas' seizure of the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima on Wednesday is the latest attack to cast a shadow on burgeoning ties between President Alberto Fujimori's Peru and the land of his ancestors.</p>
<p>Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, has bolstered trade and aid ties with Tokyo during six visits to Japan since his 1990 election and won Japanese backing for his strong-arm rule in the impoverished Andean country.</p>
<p>Tokyo, second only to the United States as a source of aid to Peru, continued aid and eschewed joining Western donors in criticising Fujimori even when he suspended constitutional rule in 1992 in a bid to tackle Maoist guerrillas.</p>
<p>Last month in Manila, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who visited Lima in August, strongly backed Peru's unsuccessful bid to win admission to the 18-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.</p>
<p>But a steady series of violent incidents have accompanied Tokyo's embrace of Peru, home to some 80,000 people of Japanese ancestry and one of Japan's top five sources of silver, copper and lead.</p>
<p>In July 1991, ultra-leftist guerrillas shot and killed three Japanese aid workers during a raid on a central Peru agricultural cooperation centre where they worked as staff of the Japan International Cooperation Agency.</p>
<p>In December 1990 and again in April 1991, Japan's Lima embassy was among a group of foreign embassies hit in simultaneous attacks attributed to Marxist guerrillas.</p>
<p>The attacks have not cooled the interest of major Japanese firms in the country, whose economic reforms have allowed it to take part in Latin America's economic boom.</p>
<p>In 1995, Peru's exports to Japan -- mostly minerals -- were worth $541 million, while Lima imported some $300 million worth of cars, electronics and machinery from Japan.</p>
<p>Peru was the leading recipient of Japanese development loans to Latin America nations, receiving 31.8 billion yen ($281 million) in 1995, the latest year for which complete figures were available. Japan's grant aid to Peru was 3.64 billion yen ($32.2 million) in 1995.</p>
<p>Testifying to the growing trans-Pacific commerce was a hostage list from the attack, which included executives from the Lima branches of Toyota Motor Corp, NEC Corp, Asahi Chemical Industry Co, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co and Mitsui Mining and Smelting Co, Japanese media reported.</p>
<p>The hostages were attending a reception hosted by ambassador Morihisa Aoki to mark Emperor Akihito's 63rd birthday on December 23 when the guerrillas attacked.</p>
<p>The business and political ties are paralleled by shadowy, little-known relations between like-minded left-wing groups in the two countries, security experts have said.</p>
<p>Last June, Peru deported suspected Japanese Red Army guerrilla Kazue Yoshimura to Japan.</p>
<p>The capture ended an international hunt for her as a suspect in the Red Army's 1974 attack on the French Embassy in the Hague.</p>
<p>It also sparked speculation over possible links between the Maoist Shining Path, seeking to regroup after its virtual defeat by Fujimori's government, and the left-wing Red Army, believed to be inactive since the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Peru's connection with the Japanese Red Army was discovered after the capture in March 1995 of a member of the movement, Yukiko Ekita, in Bucharest with a false Peruvian passport.</p>
<p>Peruvian police later said there was no evidence to charge Yoshimura with links to the Shining Path. She is currently on trial for her alleged role in the 1974 Hague attack.</p>
