<p>Once-mighty Anglo-U.S. conglomerate Hanson Plc reported a record 1.8 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) in pretax profits on Thursday, covering the last financial year before its demerger process began on October 1.</p>
<p>Lord Hanson, chairman and co-founder of the empire in the throes of a four-way split, said that prospects for its &quot;family of companies&quot; was very good.</p>
<p>But he was less happy about the progress of its share price performance which he said was &quot;very disappointing&quot;.</p>
<p>The group floated Imperial Tobacco and Millennium Chemicals in the autumn. Its energy group is due to be demerged by February, leaving behind the rump building group.</p>
<p>The combined value of Hanson and the demerged companies was 195p on December 1, 1995 and now stands at 150p, said the chairman. &quot;This in no way represents either our earning capacity or future prospects.&quot;</p>
<p>He added &quot;Hanson's profit in each of the last five years has comfortably exceeded one billion sterling and this year's result shows clearly that the momentum continues.&quot;</p>
<p>Christopher Collins, Hanson vice chairman said in an interview that the market should take a longer view in judging the Hanson companies' value.</p>
<p>&quot;Lord Hanson acknowledges that the share price is disappointing, given its earnings capacity. The time to judge is two years down the track,&quot; he said. But he declined to state what would be a more appropriate value.</p>
<p>The final pre-demerger results showed profits topping forecasts and up sharply from 1.22 billion last year.</p>
<p>But the figures were inflated by a one-off gain of 609 million pounds, compared with a 98 million charge last year. Earnings per share were 25.6 pence versus 18.2 pence and a dividend of one pence will be paid.</p>
<p>There was little extra information on the demerger process. Collins said the process remained &quot;on track&quot;.</p>
<p>Looking at a breakdown of the peformance of the two divisions which will remain, building materials and equipment reported a slip in profits to 231 million pounds from 237 million. Sales were 2.45 billion verus 2.1 billion.</p>
<p>The British arm continued to suffer from tough housing and construction markets, but some signs of a turnaround were evident. Buoyant U.S. conditions helped to outweigh the negative effects of the British building market.</p>
<p>Energy enjoyed a &quot;substantial&quot; rise in profits &quot;showing significant growth overseas and a further increase in British profit and market share. Operating profits were 458 million versus 167 million, with sales up sharply to 3.74 billion versus 1.4 billion.</p>
<p>The surge reflected Eastern electricity company's first full contribution since its takeover. It turned in 303 million in profit, comapred to a seven million contribution the previous year.</p>
<p>Collins said &quot;Eastern has been a great success and peformed far in excess of our expectations.&quot;</p>
<p>Peabody Coal saw profits slip to 154 million from 160 million as it sought to raise productivity levels which are up 12 percent.</p>
<p>Hanson shares, now trading without Imperial Tobacco and Millennium, stood at 80-1/2 pence at 1545 GMT, up 3/4p.</p>
