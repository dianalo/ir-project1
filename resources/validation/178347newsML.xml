<p>Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek's centre-left Liberal Democrats on Sunday won the most votes in the country's second general election since independence from Yugoslavia, according to partial results.</p>
<p>With 82 percent of the vote counted, the National Electoral Commission said the Liberal Democrats had won 27.10 percent of the vote, around three percent more than in the last general election in 1992.</p>
<p>Drnovsek, 46, president of the former Yugoslav federation between 1989 and 1990, had been credited with securing a stable democracy and prosperous economy in Slovenia during his four-year term of office.</p>
<p>In a sign of a shift to the right in Slovenian politics, rightwing parties increased their share of the overall vote.</p>
<p>Partial results showed the rightist People's Party, led by 36-year-old Marjan Podobnik, with 19.75 percent, and the centre-right Social Democrats third on 15.90 percent.</p>
<p>The Christian Democrats, junior partners in Drnovsek's government, received 9.77 percent of the vote, with the United List of Social Democrats, the former communists, just behind with 8.95 percent.</p>
<p>The Electoral Commission said the turnout was 65 percent, well down on the 85 percent recorded in the 1992 election.</p>
<p>Drnovsek had faced a loose pre-electoral alliance of rightwing parties, called the &quot;Slovenian Spring&quot;, comprising the People's Party, Social Democrats and Christian Democrats.</p>
<p>Social Democrat leader Janez Jansa, who was sacked as defence minister in 1994, said a coalition of the &quot;Slovenian Spring&quot; alliance was possible if the three parties stuck to their informal agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;A coalition between the Liberal Democrats, the People's Party and the Social Democrats is not probable if the 'Spring' parties get an overall majority,&quot; Jansa, a fierce rival of Drnovsek, told Slovenian news agency STA.</p>
<p>Podobnik said he hoped the &quot;Spring&quot; parties would win an overall majority, enabling the alliance to unseat Drnovsek to form a coalition without the Liberal Democrats.</p>
<p>President Milan Kucan, Slovenia's former communist party chief who defied Belgrade to lead the country to secession in 1991, was likely to call on Drnovsek to form a coalition if his Liberal Democrats remained the largest party.</p>
<p>But the People's Party argued that Kucan could turn to the &quot;Slovenian Spring&quot; alliance if the parties clinched more than 50 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>The Liberal Democrats were unlikely to turn to the leftist United List, who have been opposed to the planned tough economic measures, such as cuts in public spending, to prepare Slovenia for membership of the European Union (EU).</p>
<p>But the People's Party has also expressed reservations over rushing into membership of the EU. Slovenia signed an association agreement with the EU in June and hopes for entry by the year 2001.</p>
