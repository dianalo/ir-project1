<title>FRANCE: Air France Europe flight crew unions call strike.</title>
<headline>Air France Europe flight crew unions call strike.</headline>

<p>Two unions representing pilots and flight engineers at the Air France Europe airline called on Thursday for a two-day strike from March 31.</p>
<p>The state-owned Air France international airline is taking over on April 1 the operations of Air France Europe, the former Air Inter sister company which handles regional and domestic flights.</p>
<p>The forced merger is part of Air France chairman Christian Blanc's plan to prepare the group for the opening up of European air travel under European competition rules and eventual privatisation.</p>
<p>The USPNT and SPIT unions said in a joint notice to Blanc that they were protesting against the absence of negotiations on renewing a company agreement on work conditions.</p>
<p>Air France is taking over Air France Europe operations through a management lease (location gerance) agreement ahead of a full legal merger due in September.</p>
<p>The unions said they were opposed to the imposition of employment current at Air France, under the management lease, which harmed Air France Europe pay conditions.</p>
<p>They also objected to the introduction of pay measures into the whole Air France group which would hurt present and future crews, notably a double pay scale, one for current crews and a lower starting pay for younger pilots to be hired.</p>
<p>An Air France Europe spokeswoman said the extent of disruption would be known on Friday.</p>
<p>The two unions between them represent around 50 percent of the 770 pilots and flight engineers in Air France Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;The Air France pilots obtained a certain number of things. We want to get the same,&quot; an official of the SPIT said.</p>
<p>Air France pilots last week decided to delay a four-day strike called for March 23 until May, after the company made proposals on the double pay scale which were seen open to a compromise.</p>
