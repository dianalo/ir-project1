<p>Shareholders at German drugs and chemicals giant Hoechst AG on Tuesday sharply criticised management for opaque communications policies, blaming these for a 22 percent drop in the group's share price this spring.</p>
<p>&quot;A pledge to improve shareholder value is worth nothing if shareholders are not informed in a timely fashion,&quot; Jella Benner-Heinacher, a spokeswoman for German shareholder group Deutsche Schutzvereinigung fuer Wertpapierbesitz, told the firm's annual meeting.</p>
<p>Venting their anger after watching Hoechst shares plunge 22 percent in value as markets punished the group for failing to deliver promised strong results, shareholders said the board had gambled away trust in the 134 year-old company.</p>
<p>&quot;Hoechst shares have fallen from grace, they are no longer a market darling but an underperformer,&quot; Benner-Heinacher said.</p>
<p>While shares have slowly crawled higher again, climbing 2.6 percent to 68.08 in Tuesday bourse trade, they plummeted from an all-time high of 80.80 marks ($46.77) on March 11 to a low of 62.80 marks on April 3.</p>
<p>News of a lower than expected four billion mark 1996 operating profit, a 383 million mark fourth quarter loss, and the board's decision to shelve plans to list drugs unit Hoechst Marion Roussel(HMR) on the bourse combined to trigger the fall.</p>
<p>Many analysts immediately downgraded recommendations and earnings per share estimates after the slew of negative news, complaining about the company's failure to issue a profit warning about the fourth quarter loss.</p>
<p>While some said Hoechst ultimately made the right decision in scuttling HMR's bourse listing as the unit's 14.3 percent operating margin would not attract enough investors leaving it vulnerable for a takeover, they said the news was a shock.</p>
<p>But analysts said the group's management board appears to have learned its lesson and on Monday offered far better guidance about the group's activities with a very detailed first quarter results statement.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the main messages at Hoechst on Monday was that they offered a lot of very good information,&quot; said BZW analyst Andreas Schmidt, saying this might restore some shine to the firm's battered image. On Monday, the company said its first-quarter pre-tax profit fell 33 percent to 831 million marks from a year ago, though this represented a nine percent rise, on an adjusted basis. Hoechst management board chairman Juergen Dormann, the architect of far-reaching restructuring plans, promised shareholders an increase in operating profits this year.</p>
<p>Although absolute operating profit and sales would likely come in below last year's results as Hoechst has spun-off a number of divisions, Dormann promised &quot;on an adjusted basis operating profit will show an increase&quot;.</p>
<p>Shareholders will on Tuesday vote on Hoechst's plans to revamp itself into a strategic management holding group where Hoechst AG will no longer have responsibility for operating business, but transfer that right to individual business units.</p>
<p>Dormann explained that plans to become a leading life science group, largely concentrating on pharmaceuticals and agriculture, would allow Hoechst to better position itself within a increasingly more competitive industry.</p>
<p>While Dormann has in the past hinted at possible further acquistions and on Tuesday said the group's cash flow &quot;continues to be acceptable and leaves open room for further growth,&quot; he later said the group was not actively looking for acquisitions.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to concentrate on the planned restructuring.&quot;</p>
<p>Shareholders will also be asked to approve plans to transfer the group's underperforming speciality chemicals business to Swiss group Clariant AG.</p>
<p>Karl-Gerhard Seifert, the Hoechst board member in charge of this business unit, was due to resign his duties at Hoechst on Tuesday and transfer to Clariant as chief executive officer, Hoechst said.</p>
<p>Dormann also said that group still expected to list Hoechst AG shares on the New York bourse this year, becoming the fourth large German firm to do so. Originally scheduled for October, Hoechst chief financial officer Klaus-Juergen Schmieder said the listing could occur as early as September, but that a firm date had not been set with U.S. officials.</p>
