<headline>UK's Major slams Labour's campaign tactics.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prime Minister John Major on Tuesday described as &quot;outrageous&quot; the allegations made by the opposition Labour Party about what a Conservative government would do if he wins Thursday's election.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Conservative party had even remotely suggested anything as outrageous as have our political opponents I think you know precisely what would have been shouted from one end of the country to the other about negative campaigning,&quot; Major told a breakfast meeting for businessmen and party workers.</p>
<p>Major described Labour's allegations that the Conservatives would get rid of the welfare state as &quot;a monstrosity of a perversion.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Labour claims that the Conservatives would get rid of the state pension were &quot;a contemptible smear of the sort I have rarely ever encountered before in politics.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that claims that a new Conservative government would put value addex tax on food were also equally unjustified.</p>
<p>Labour was putting out &quot;blatant untruths day after day, not in a single speech but as part of carefully calculated campaigning.&quot;</p>
