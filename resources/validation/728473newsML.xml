<p>Canadian firm Sutton Resources Ltd will sign a $25 million joint venture agreement next week covering its Kabanga nickel and cobalt deposit in northwest Tanzania, a senior company official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sutton's resident director, Bill Bali, told Reuters that its locally incorporated company, Kabanga Nickel Ltd, would enter into the agreement as a junior partner.</p>
<p>&quot;A deal will be signed on July 21 in (the Tanzanian town of) Dodoma between Sutton Resources Ltd and a large South African mining house. This will be for a joint venture,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bali said the name of the South African partner would be revealed on the signing day.</p>
<p>Australian mining giant The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP) withdrew from the Kabanga project in mid-1996.</p>
<p>Bali said Sutton geologists had projected a potential deposit of one billion pounds of nickel and 120 million pounds of cobalt at its prospect in Ngara in northwest Tanzania.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of geological grade, the nickel is two percent above average while the cobalt is a co-product and not a by-product,&quot; said Bali.</p>
<p>He added: &quot;Something like $25 million will be spent on the project to bring it up to feasibility phase towards the end of the millennium.&quot;</p>
<p>If a decision was taken to develop the deposit, the estimated cost of bringing the nickel/cobalt prospect into full production was about $250 million compared to about $175 million for Sutton's gold deposit at Bulyankulu.</p>
<p>A nickel plant requires heavy power usage of about 35 megawatts compared to 10 megawatts for gold. A 10-megawatt gold plant could process about 4,000 tonnes of ore per day while the 35-megawatts required for nickel/cobalt would handle between 10,000 and 20,000 tonnes per day, Bali said.</p>
<p>Tanzania is experiencing an upsurge of activity in its embryonic mining sector, particularly among gold explorers whose main focus is the potentially lucrative Lake Victoria goldfield.</p>
<p>Four major gold projects, each with a resource base in excess of one million ounces, could be in production within the next four years.</p>
<p>Kahama Mining Corp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sutton, is developing a world-class gold project at Bulyankulu in the Lake Victoria goldfields and expects to pour its first gold from the fully-commissioned mine in 1999.</p>
