<p>Dutch financial services group ING Groep NV is not considering a major acquisition although it can afford to expand in its core businesses of banking and insurance, executive board chairman Aad Jacobs said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Nothing that ING was named almost every day as a possible buyer in both sectors around the world, he said this reputation was unfounded as it was actually very selective.</p>
<p>Indicating the group's financial capacity, he said capital and surplus rose about 10 billion guilders ($5.4 billion) in calendar 1996, helped by buoyant sharemarkets and retained earnings.</p>
<p>ING had the capacity to buy both an insurance company and a bank but any large acquisition would have to make a positive contribution to earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;This company is fortunately rich enough to afford to make acquisitions on both sides,&quot; Jacobs said in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no important acquisitions in mind at this moment. Of course, we are always looking around but there's nothing special on our minds.&quot;</p>
<p>ING, which is interested in making a U.S. acquisition, last year missed out on buying insurer First Colony, which was sold to a rival bidder for $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;But there are many insurance companies in the U.S,.&quot; said Jacobs.</p>
<p>Outlining the Dutch group's offshore expansion plans, he said ING would continue to establish &quot;greenfield&quot; insurance operations and build its banking network.</p>
<p>He saw the Far East, Latin America and Eastern Europe as growth areas but declined to say which was most attractive.</p>
<p>&quot;In all of these areas, we are very well placed for growth,&quot; said Jacobs.</p>
<p>But in Asia, few acquisition opportunities were available and, where they were, asking prices were too high.</p>
