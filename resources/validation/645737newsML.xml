<p>Tokyo stocks are likely to climb on Monday, helped by a surge in Wall Street stocks on Friday. But the stronger yen against the dollar is expected to keep investors from aggressively buying export-oriented shares, limiting the upside of the key market index, brokers said.</p>
<p>On Friday, the 225-share Nikkei average finished at 20,485.75, down 2.40 points or 0.01 percent. Its June futures added 30 to end at 20,500.</p>
<p>&quot;The Nikkei average is likely to reach at least 20,600 today,&quot; said Yasuo Ueki, general manager of the equities operations group at Nikko Securities Co Ltd.  </p>
<p>&quot;A rise in U.S. stocks will stimulate buying in Tokyo, but the higher yen could partly offset any buying,&quot; said a broker at a medium-sized Japanese securities house.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Dow industrials leapt 130.49 points to end at a record high of 7,435.78, after a monthly employment report reinforced investors' positive outlook on the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The dollar traded at 113.80/90 yen in early Asia trade on Monday, against 115.70/80 yen in late Friday trade in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Nikko's Ueki said investors would be interested in domestic economy-oriented sectors, such as raw materials, semiconductors, retail and real estate.</p>
