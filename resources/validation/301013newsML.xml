<p>British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind wound up talks on bilateral relations with his Argentine counterpart Guido Di Tella on Saturday and no further meetings are planned, a foreign office spokesman said.</p>
<p>The two men had discussed the remote Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, scene of a bloody 10-week war between the two countries in 1982, but came to no particular conclusions, the spokesman said by telephone.</p>
<p>Britain said before the talks began that there could be no question of it offering to share or transfer sovereignty of the islands to Argentina.</p>
<p>A Buenos Aires newspaper on Saturday said Di Tella had asked Rifkind to set a date for public talks on sovereignty over the islands. Argentina lost the war but maintains its claim to the sparsely-populated archipelago, which it calls the Malvinas.</p>
<p>Since Argentine President Carlos Menem came to power in 1989, he has resumed diplomatic ties, hosted visits by members of the British royal family and forged close trade links, while insisting he will win back the islands by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Di Tella has received flak for a charm offensive that has included sending islanders Christmas cards, books and videos.</p>
<p>He recently said he had won little ground, then changed tack to claim he had secured a radical change in attitude among the islanders and managed to make the British nervous.</p>
<p>He also said a deal with Britain on oil exploration in the South Atlantic signed last year was &quot;the biggest advance in 170 years&quot; of territorial dispute.</p>
