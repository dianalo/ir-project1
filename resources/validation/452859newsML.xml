<p>Dock workers at Buenaventura, Colombia's main Pacific coast port and the shipment point for 60 percent of the country's coffee exports, are threatening new strike action, a union official said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The strike, which could begin in less than a month if no deal is reached, is being threatened in protest at port operators' failure to fulfill the terms of an accord hammered out in January, which ended a crippling nine-day work stoppage.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are some operators who are not fulfilling the accord and that means workers are not receiving salary rises and additional benefits,&quot; said Nelson Amaya, regional head of the Unitary Labor Confederation (CUT).</p>
<p>&quot;But if we cannot work something out workers could go out on strike within 30 days,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Buenaventura's estimated 3,000 dock workers went on strike for nine days in January, an action that paralyzed 305,000 60-kg bags of coffee exports and 27,000 tonnes of sugar. The deal to end that stoppage included higher wages, sickness and injury benefits and increased meal allowances.  </p>
<p>But Amaya said that many of the port's primary operators, those that own cranes and other cargo handling equipment, were not paying higher rates to the secondary operators, those that contract labor to handle individual cargoes. That meant that the workers were not getting higher wages as agreed, he said.</p>
<p>Amaya said he would be meeting with port authorities and regional political leaders Wednesday and Thursday and would travel to the port to talk to workers next week.</p>
<p>He warned, however, that a fresh strike would be potentially more devastating than the January stoppage given that campaigns are under way for local elections in October and prospective candidates may seek to politicize the strike issue.</p>
<p>In other developments, members of the Colombian Truck Drivers' Association (ACC), which represents an estimated 80 percent of the country's truckers, are due to set the date for the start of a new nationwide strike at a meeting Saturday.</p>
<p>They, too, argue that transport companies have reneged on an agreement worked out to end the crippling 11-day truck drivers' strike last October, which virtually paralyzed all road freight.</p>
