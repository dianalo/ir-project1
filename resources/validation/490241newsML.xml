<p>With a &quot;sleaze&quot; scandal dogging Britain's ruling Conservatives, local party members meet on Tuesday to decide whether former minister Neil Hamilton should stand as a candidate in the May 1 general election.</p>
<p>The election campaign was enlivened on Monday when one of Britain's best-known journalists, BBC war reporter Martin Bell, said he would stand as an &quot;anti-corruption&quot; candidate against Hamilton, who denies allegations that he took cash to ask questions in parliament for business interests.</p>
<p>The Conservative majority of some 22,000 in Hamilton's Tatton constituency in northwest England looks under threat if he is the party's candidate.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not confident that Martin Bell will pull this off, but I think he deserves to, I'd love to see him do it,&quot; said one Tatton man interviewed by BBC radio.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Hamilton should stand down. Whether he's innocent or guilty, I don't think that makes any difference now, I think it's gone too far and he should stand down,&quot; a female constituent told the news programme.</p>
<p>The Conservatives have been hit by a series of financial and sex scandals, undermining confidence in the government of John Major even though Britain's economic situation is relatively good, with unemployment falling and inflation low.</p>
<p>A poll published in Tuesday's Daily Telegraph newspaper puts Labour 20 points ahead of the Conservatives with the backing of 53 percent of the electorate.</p>
<p>&quot;The swing towards Labour since the 1992 election now stands at 13.8 percent and the projected Labour majority (in the lower House of Commons) is 211,&quot; the Telegraph said.</p>
<p>Secure in that 20-point lead, Labour leader Tony Blair admitted on Monday that his party had been slow to modernise itself in the 1980s when it stuck to socialist policies like nationalisation.</p>
<p>&quot;There were certain things the Conservatives got right in the 1980s and we should have been quicker to face up to that,&quot; he said in an interview on BBC television.</p>
<p>Blair said that Labour may have  changed its policies but its principles remained the same.</p>
<p>&quot;We always believed in the idea of a more just and more fair society, and the Labour Party believed for a long period of time that the way to do that was, for example, greater nationalisation...was for example, simply more increased state spending.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole process of modernisation has been to take the Labour Party away from that -- keep true to its principles but put those principles properly in a modern setting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, in a speech to a business audience in London, Blair stressed his party's new-found faith in market forces and its rejection of nationalisation and high taxes.</p>
<p>The party's economics spokesman, Gordon Brown, refused to rule out proceeding with Conservative plans to privatise Britain's air traffic control industry. Labour had previously opposed the sell-off on safety grounds.</p>
<p>Newspapers speculated that other assets, including the Royal Mail postal service, could also be sold off, a prospect greeted with anger by the postal workers' union, which led a successful fight to make the Conservatives shelve privatisation plans.</p>
