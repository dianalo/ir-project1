<p>As Pakistan celebrates its golden jubilee, dismal social and economic indicators offer a stark reminder of the limited progress of the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Hampered by a chronic budget deficit, a widening trade gap and soaring debt, the economy has slowed in the 1990s after growing steadily in the first four decades of independence.</p>
<p>Gross domestic product expanded a paltry 3.1 percent in fiscal 1996/97 (July-June), just ahead of the 2.9 percent population growth rate, and down from last year's 4.6 percent.</p>
<p>The trade gap stood at a provisional $3.373 billion in 1996/97, compared to $3.666 billion in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's six-month old government has introduced several reform packages to revive the economy, but analysts say these will take time to show an impact.</p>
<p>&quot;Reviving the battered economy is an uphill task even if the government manages to implement its policies. There are no short cuts to clear up the mess of past governments,&quot; said an analyst at a foreign brokerage house.</p>
<p>POVERTY ON THE RISE IN PAKISTAN</p>
<p>In the social sector, Pakistan lags behind its neighbours despite achieving a gross national product growth rate of 231 percent, the highest in South Asia, in the last two decades.</p>
<p>Thirty percent of its 138 million people were classed as living in absolute poverty in 1996, up from 20 percent in 1990.</p>
<p>Pakistan's literacy rate, at 36 percent, is one of the world's lowest. Basic health facilities and clean water are available only to half the population. Over 70 percent have no access to sanitation, according to a report on Human Development in South Asia produced by an Islamabad-based think-tank.</p>
<p>&quot;On average, Pakistan has done well in terms of economic growth since 1947. It has recorded a 5.6 percent rise (a year) in the last 50 years,&quot; said independent economist Akbar Zaidi.</p>
<p>&quot;But Pakistan's performance in human development and the social sector is poor. It's a paradox. The country achieved a high growth rate despite poor social and human development, while economic growth did not translate into the social sector.&quot;</p>
<p>EARLY GROWTH BRAKED BY STATE CONTROL</p>
<p>In the first two decades of independence, Pakistan surprised critics who had challenged the new Islamic state's economic viability by achieving a tremendous growth rate.</p>
<p>&quot;Pakistan's founders started from scratch to establish trade and industry in what were the most backward parts of British India,&quot; says Ibrahim Latif Jamal, whose family migrated from India to set up business in Karachi after Partition in 1947.</p>
<p>In 1951, raw commodities made up 92.2 percent of exports, Zaidi said. &quot;In 1996, raw commodities comprised 16 percent, while manufactured and semi-manufactured goods accounted for 62 and 22 percent respectively,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>While Pakistan coped with millions of refugees and political instability in its first decade, businessmen exported primary goods and shifted capital into industry, which expanded fast in the second decade under military ruler General Ayub Khan.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto administered a rude jolt in the 1970s with a programme of nationalisation and state control after the traumatic loss of East Pakistan.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a new country as East Pakistan became Bangladesh,&quot; Zaidi said. &quot;Exports boomed after a 127 percent devaluation of the rupee, but the hike in petrol prices offset this advantage.&quot;</p>
<p>During the 1980s, Pakistan's economy floated on foreign aid flooding in from the West and Arab oil states to help Afghan Islamic guerrillas fight Soviet troops in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>ECONOMIC REFORM YET TO BEAR FULL FRUIT</p>
<p>In the harsher climate of the 1990s, economic policy lurched towards denationalisation and liberalisation under the guidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p>
<p>Zaidi said the economy had declined in the past decade, particularly over the last three years. &quot;The economy slowed down because foreign channels of funding gradually dried up.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign aid dwindled in the post-Cold War era and remittances from expatriate Pakistanis fell as the Gulf boom (of the 1970s and 1980s) came to an end. The hasty implementation of IMF and World Bank policies also had a negative impact.&quot;</p>
<p>Zaidi said there was a consensus for economic liberalisation and privatisation despite political instability. Many analysts say Sharif's reforms can work if properly implemented.</p>
<p>&quot;Now it's a question of how the government solves its political problems, including corruption, violence, bad governance, and improves the social indicators,&quot; Zaidi said.</p>
<p>&quot;If in the past human and social capital formation did not matter, in the next 20 years it will be critical. Pakistan will lose out if it does not invest in it.&quot;</p>
