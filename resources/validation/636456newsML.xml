<p>Yields for Romanian three-month treasury bills sank to 49 percent at Wednesday's auction from 65 percent in the previous session last month, central bank (BNR) data showed.</p>
<p>The finance ministry issue of 643.24 billion lei in rollover bills was heavily oversubscribed with 18 banks bidding a total 1.598 trillion lei.  </p>
<p>BNR data showed the finance ministry accepted 643.24 billion lei worth of bids which offered yields ranging from 45 percent to 80 percent.</p>
<p>Some 75 percent of the T-bills, placed through a Dutch style auction, were bought by banks and the rest went to their corporate clients.</p>
<p>The fixed-interest T-bills' issue date is June 6 and they mature on September 4.</p>
<p>But traders said short-term money market prices stayed near 60 percent with some players ready to take leu funds.</p>
<p>They said the yield plunge was a result of low bids made by banks keen to take such paper in their portfolio.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the money market has been highly liquid as the BNR soaked up the dollar excess to prevent the leu from firming.</p>
<p>The BNR dollar purchases flooded the money market with leu funds, triggering a rapid fall in interest rates to about 60 percent, compared with about 190 percent in early April.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the leu was trading at about 7,140/180 to the dollar, almost unchanged from levels earlier this week.</p>
