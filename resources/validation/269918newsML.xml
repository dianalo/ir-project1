<dateline>ISTANBUL 1996-12-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Istanbul shares firmed an average 0.45 percent in continued selective activity on Friday, despite profit-taking which erased part of the earlier gains, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB-100 closed at an all-time high of 94,879.14, up 427.97 points from Thursday's previous record of 94,451.17. It brushed a high of 95,463 in early trade.</p>
<p>In dollar terms, the index stood at 89.5 cents, up slightly from Thursday's $0.89 and compared to a $1 record on April 8.  </p>
<p>Trade volume plunged to 19.30 trillion lira from Thursday's 31.19 trillion lira, partly due to a sharp drop in turnover in utility Aktas Elektrik which yesterday led the market and made up 26 percent of the total volume.</p>
<p>Brokers said prices fell briefly in early afternoon trade after European credit rating agency IBCA downgraded the long-term foreign currency rating of Turkey's all senior and unsecured debt issues to B plus from BB minus.</p>
<p>&quot;The lack of any substantial reaction in financial markets and bourses to cuts by two major credit rating agencies proves that conditions that led to the 1994 (financial) crisis do not exist,&quot; said Huseyin Savasan from Aks securities.</p>
<p>He said sentiment had improved strongly after Tuesday's bond auction where the Treasury succeeded in issuing first ever 13-month bonds at sharply lower yields. The index had surged 8.2 percent on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the index's uptrend to continue at a slower pace with share-based activity and under normal conditions until the end of the year,&quot; said Irfan Sakin from Global securities.</p>
<p>Over the week, the index jumped 6.2 percent despite Monday's 2.44 percent fall prompted by the S&amp;P's dowgrading of Turkey's long-term foreign currency debt rating last Friday.</p>
<p>It had dived 5.37 percent last week amid rumours ahead of the S&amp;P's rate cut following a failed attempt to pierce stiff resistance at 95,000.</p>
<p>Of the 232 shares traded, 102 fell, 70 rose and 60 closed unchanged. The 85-share industrial index gained 1.62 percent to 101,982.08 while the 15-share financial index lost 2.16 percent to 88,309.91.</p>
<p>Utilities were again the top actives. Cukurova Elektrik rose 17,500 lira to 132,500, Kepez Elektrik gained 10,000 lira to 117,500 and Aktas Elektrik fell 1,000 lira to 95,000. They were followed by largely state-owned petroleum refiner Tupras which firmed 1,750 lira to 25,000.</p>
<p>Trade in the four most active stocks made up 34.7 percent of the total volume.</p>
