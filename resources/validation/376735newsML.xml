<p>Albania is facing its worst crisis since it ditched communism six years ago and President Sali Berisha's right-wing government has to find a way out of a tight corner to stem an increasingly violent wave of unrest.</p>
<p>Strong-arm tactics by special police forces and the secret police, including beatings and mass arrests, have done little to extinguish the fury of thousands of Europe's poorest people who have lost everything in failed pyramid investment schemes.</p>
<p>Berisha's offer to compensate the get-rich-quick hopefuls with savings books, bonds or shares has fallen on deaf ears. Albanians want their money back and they want it now.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is going to find it very difficult to find that sort of money with the pressures it has on revenue. The sums involved are huge,&quot; said Heather Grabbe, a research fellow at London's Royal Institute for International Affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;They seem to be in a no-win situation,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>With little chance of finding millions of dollars to hand back to small investors, the options available to Berisha to quell the troubles are few and precarious.</p>
<p>With tension palpable throughout the country, deploying the army in a tough nationwide crackdown would only serve to inflame tempers further. A political gesture, such as sacking the government, could tear the Democrats apart.</p>
<p>Politically, Berisha has entered a weak phase. He has to seek re-election by parliament by April 9.</p>
<p>Under the constitution he is hamstrung. Six months before his five-year term ends, a president's powers are curtailed and Berisha cannot dissolve parliament. While the Democrats secured 122 seats in the 140-member parliament in last May's disputed general election, Berisha has still to tread carefully.</p>
<p>The Democrats are splitting into two camps with moderates scrambling to Berisha's side and hardliners backing Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi, Albanian political analysts say.</p>
<p>Their views are echoed by the influential co-founder of the Democratic Party, Azem Hajdari, who earned hero status in the 1990 anti-communist revolt by leading students onto the streets.</p>
<p>A Democrat deputy and trade union leader, he warned the government last year that the pyramid schemes would mean trouble and has distanced himself from the government line.</p>
<p>&quot;President Berisha is a moderate. He will never allow the army or anyone else to open fire on protesters,&quot; Hajdari said in a recent interview. &quot;The problem can only be solved if the government resigns.&quot;</p>
<p>A sign of discord within the Democratic Party emerged this week when deputies declined to back a proposal by Meksi to declare emergency measures to stamp out violence in the Adriatic port of Vlore. Three people died there in a protest on Monday and a policeman was shot dead on Wednesday.</p>
<p>While government leaders struggle to solve the crisis, the opposition blames the West for failing to react to what it regards as growing authoritarian rule and for remaining silent while democratic commitments were flouted.</p>
<p>With most diplomatic effort channeled into halting the bloodshed in Bosnia, Western nations, and Europe in particular, paid scant attention next door to the worrying developments in Albania's fragile democracy, opposition figures charge.</p>
<p>Berisha's main rival, Socialist leader Fatos Nano, is in jail on corruption charges. Amnesty International and other rights activists say Nano's trial was flawed and he should be set free.</p>
<p>Albania's supreme court chief Zef Brozi dared in 1995 to say Nano was innocent and was subsequently sacked. He said this month that Albania was becoming a police state.</p>
<p>Rights groups have expressed concern over the beatings and harassment of opposition members, reporters and photographers.</p>
<p>A law passed in 1995 banned most former communist officials from standing for public office until 2002, effectively wiping out most senior opposition figures from the political scene, coincidentally, until the end of a Berisha second term.</p>
<p>The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) produced a scathing report on last year's general election, after its observers catalogued irregularities, electoral law violations and cases of intimidation.</p>
<p>Officials rejected the report, even accusing some OSCE monitors of being collaborators of the Stalinist regime of hardman Enver Hoxha.</p>
<p>The United States called for an early general election, but European governments largely ignored the issue.</p>
<p>The OSCE says it is worried about the violence in Albania and warned the potential for a serious crisis is at hand.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a warning to Tirana. We are keeping a very close eye on what is going on there,&quot; an OSCE diplomat said.</p>
<p>But two months after violence began to convulse Albania, the international community maintains its risky hands-off approach in a region which not so long ago experienced Europe's first war since 1945.</p>
