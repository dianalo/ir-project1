<title>USA: Tribune Co. earnings gain.</title>
<headline>Tribune Co. earnings gain.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-07-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tribune Co., publisher of the Chicago Tribune, said Friday its net income rose 11 percent in the second quarter, bolstered by strong returns from its publishing, broadcasting and entertainment businesses.</p>
<p>Excluding gains from special items, the company registered profits of $93 million during the quarter, up from $84 million in the same year-ago period. Earnings per share rose to 72 cents, from 65 cents a share a year ago.</p>
<p>Higher advertising sales and lower newsprint prices drove publishing operating profits up by 27 percent, to $92 million, a record for the second quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;Our publishing group had an outstanding second quarter with excellent revenue growth led by classified advertising,&quot; Chairman John Madigan said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company said the earnings growth was partially offset by higher net interest expense.</p>
<p>Interest expense more than doubled from last year, climbing to $25 million from $11 million, due to higher debt levels resulting from acquisitions and stock repurchases.</p>
<p>The company owns 16 television stations, 4 radio stations and 3 newspapers besides the Tribune. It is also the owner of the Chicago Cubs baseball team.</p>
<p>Tribune's stock slipped 12.5 cents to $53.4375 on the New York Stock Exchange at midday.</p>
<p>Newspaper companies have benefited from robust advertising revenues this quarter. The New York Times Co., parent of The New York Times and The Boston Globe, Thursday reported that its second-quarter profits climbed 80 percent to $84.9 million.</p>
