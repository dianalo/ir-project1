<p>Weeping family members on Friday greeted the coffin of a Hong Kong activist leader who drowned in a protest over disputed East China Sea islands, while Tokyo racked its brains on how to calm anti-Japanese passions.</p>
<p>Relatives and friends of David Chan draped the red flag of communist-ruled China over the coffin on its arrival from Taiwan.</p>
<p>They bowed three times in a traditional Chinese gesture of respect at a mourning ceremony on the tarmac at Hong Kong airport. Banners with the words &quot;Eternal Glory to Chan&quot; and &quot;Noble Patriot&quot; were hung on the coffin.</p>
<p>&quot;If Chan died in Chinese waters then it was worthwhile, but if he died in Japanese waters it is sad, and shame on the Chinese government,&quot; said activist Wong Wai-ming.</p>
<p>Chan, 45, died when he jumped into the sea from a rusty protest ship on Thursday in a last act of defiance over Japan's rule of what it calls the Senkaku Islands. Both China and Taiwan also claim the islands, which they call the Diaoyus.</p>
<p>At stake is a cluster of uninhabited rocky outcrops. They have kindled fiery passions among the Chinese since Japanese extremists built a lighthouse and planted flags there in July.</p>
<p>Japan has claimed sovereign rights to the islands and refused to acknowledge that the dispute is still open for discussion with China.</p>
<p>Tokyo's claim dates to 1895 when it defeated China and seized Taiwan and other islands. China has claimed the disputed islets for centuries. The British colony of Hong Kong returns to Chinese rule next year.</p>
<p>Also Friday, the distressed skipper of the protest tanker Kien Hwa 2 apologised to Chan's family at the airport.</p>
<p>&quot;I had promised before setting sail for the Diaoyu Islands that I would bring them back safely. I failed. I brought one less person back,&quot; said a weeping Ngai Lup-chee.</p>
<p>The tragedy shocked Hong Kong's majority Chinese community and complicated a dilemma facing Beijing and Tokyo, who are anxious not to let the dispute wreck relations.</p>
<p>The two Asian powers seemed helpless to tackle the anti-Japan mood. &quot;Do you have any suggestions? We're racking our brains,&quot; Japanese government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama told reporters in Tokyo.</p>
<p>China's mission in Hong Kong said activists in the territory and in nearby Macau should show restraint.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese government sympathises with activities that are being conducted in Hong Kong to protect the Diaoyus...but it hopes these activities in Hong Kong and Macau can be conducted in a rational manner,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese government advocates settling this conflict peacefully through diplomatic channels,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nozomu Akizuki, a professor at Tokai University near Tokyo, said there was no solution at present. &quot;A rash action would merely add fuel to the flames. The best thing to do is to remain silent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Activists in Taiwan, considered a renegade province by Beijing, said a protest flotilla of more than 20 boats would sail to the disputed islands on October 6.</p>
<p>Hong Kong groups plan a candlelight vigil to mourn Chan on Sunday.</p>
<p>On a visit to Australia, Hong Kong Chief Secretary Anson Chan urged protesters not to jeopardise relations with Tokyo.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand the depth of feeling but I hope that views will be expressed in a calm manner without affecting the relationship between ourselves and Japan,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>At least six organisations have sprouted in Hong Kong in recent weeks in a wave of nationalistic fervour.</p>
<p>Small protest groups gathered outside Japan's consulate shouting &quot;down with Japanese militarism&quot; and handed in petitions to consular staff on Friday urging Japan to quit the islands.</p>
