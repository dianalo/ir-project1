<p>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Sunday that the United States was ready to help former wartime foe Vietnam down the long road toward creating a modern economy.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a real interest in seeing Vietnam be successful,&quot; he told reporters in Hanoi. &quot;It's a bigger market for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Rubin, who arrived Sunday after attending a meeting of Asia-Pacific finance ministers in the Philippines, is the highest ranking U.S. economic official to visit the communist country since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.</p>
<p>His arrival comes as the country's government is facing the most serious test yet of its 11-year-old economic reform programme, with troubles looming in the banking industry and the state sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The country has done quite a lot of reforms,&quot; Rubin said, but added: &quot;Right now it looks like there is an awful lot they need to do if they are going to have sustained success over the long run.&quot;</p>
<p>Rubin said the United States wanted to do what it could to help Vietnam help itself, adding that in the process U.S. companies could benefit. Many foreigh companies seem to have come to Vietnam with a lot of enthusiasm but have since run into problems, he noted.</p>
<p>Speaking in Washington last week before setting off on a six-day trip to Asia, Rubin said he hoped his visit would provide a &quot;fresh start&quot; to economic relations between the two former wartime foes.</p>
<p>On Monday, he is slated to sign a $145 million debt rescheduling agreement with Vietnamese Finance Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung.</p>
<p>Under the pact, Hanoi agreed to pay back debts run up by South Vietnam to buy grain and build roads and power stations before the former U.S. ally was conquered by the communist North in 1975.</p>
<p>&quot;Conclusion of this financial agreement...gives an important aspect of our relationship a fresh start,&quot; Rubin said.</p>
<p>Rubin, who will also meet Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet on Monday, said Vietnam's commitment to resume regular debt repayments to the United States was a necessary step towards it getting new loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and other U.S. government credit programmes.</p>
<p>Vietnam is also anxious to reach a trade agreement with the United States that would give it most favoured nation (MFN) trading privileges.</p>
<p>MFN, which guarantees non-discriminatory tariff rates on exports to the United States, would make Vietnamese textile makers and other goods manufacturers more competitive in the huge American market.</p>
<p>In order to strike a trade agreement, Hanoi must be willing to promise to substantially open up its markets and treat U.S. companies operating in Vietnam the same way it does local businesses, Rubin said.</p>
<p>Such reforms &quot;could provide the impetus for Vietnam's emergence as the next Asian tiger,&quot; he added, in a reference to high-growth Asian economies like Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea.</p>
<p>Rubin winds up his trip to Asia on Tuesday after a visit to Ho Chi Minh City, the former South Vietnamese capital of Saigon.</p>
