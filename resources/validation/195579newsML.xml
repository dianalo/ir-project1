<p>On the eve of a United Nations debate on Afghanistan, the Taleban Islamic movement has appealed for recognition as the legitimate authority in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The acting Minister of Information in the Taleban administration, Amir Khan Mutaqi, said on Sunday the United Nations would be committing a &quot;moral crime&quot; by failing to recognise what he said was the Taleban's rightful status.</p>
<p>&quot;A real Islamic government has been established in Afghanistan. It controls most of the country, including the capital, and we ask the U.N. to give the Afghan seat to the real representatives of the Afghan nation,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>The Taleban control almost 75 per cent of Afghanistan, but they are fighting forces loyal to the ousted government and their ally General Abdul Rashid Dostum on a front line some 20 to 25 kilometers (15 to 19 miles) north of Kabul and in the northern provinces of Badghis and Faryab.</p>
<p>Neither the United Nations nor any country has recognised the Taleban as country's legitimate government and the U.N. Afghan seat is currently occupied by a representative of the ousted administration of Burhanuddin Rabbani.</p>
<p>&quot;If the U.N. still wants to keep the seat for the ousted government...then they will be committing a moral crime,&quot; said Mutaqi. &quot;It is against natural law and the principles of the U.N. It is a crime and a tyranny against our people.&quot;</p>
<p>The Taleban said on Saturday they had appointed a former deputy foreign minister Hamid Karzai, as Afghanistan's representative to the United Nations.</p>
<p>Mutaqi went on to accuse foreign countries of interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign circles are helping our enemies and we consider them accomplices to the murder of Afghans because they are assisting opposition groups financially and militarily,&quot; Mutaqi told journalists.</p>
<p>Mutaqi singled out Iran, India and Russia for special criticism, accusing them of helping the opposition in what he described as their &quot;oppression&quot; in the north of the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Dostum and his militia forces are not the only criminals responsible for the ongoing oppression in the north. Iran, India and Russia are co-operating with them and are involved in this crime,&quot; said Mutaqi.</p>
<p>The warring sides in Afghanistan's war frequently accuse each other of receiving aid from foreign countries. No country or faction has ever admitted to giving or receiving support.</p>
<p>Mutaqi urged the international community to condemn foreign assistance to their opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;For a solution to the Afghan issue, we ask the international community to condemn foreign military and financial aid given to Dostum and his carpetbaggers.&quot;</p>
<p>The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said thousands of refugees have fled renewed fighting in the northern provinces. The acting minister of information urged aid for them.</p>
<p>&quot;We ask the international community for aid for the refugees from Faryab and Badghis who have settled in (the northwestern Taleban-held city of) Herat. We ask for food and shelter for these poeple in this cold weather.&quot; said Mutaqi.</p>
