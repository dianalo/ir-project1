<headline>DRI/McGraw Hill says China bank problem &quot;enormous&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. economic forecasting firm DRI/McGraw Hill said Tuesday that China's troubled banking sector represents one of the most serious threats to global market stability.</p>
<p>China's banking problem is &quot;enormous,&quot; DRI/McGraw Hill said in a survey of the world's biggest emerging markets. Within the next three to five years, China could default on between 20 and 40 percent of the country's $600 billion in outstanding loans, it added.</p>
<p>&quot;... The risk of (China's) serious debt problem will continue to mount and could have major economic ramifications for many of China's smaller and weaker economic neighbours,&quot; the report, entitled &quot;Country Risk Review&quot;, said.</p>
<p>Chinese banks have been crippled by government policies that force them to make questionable loans to state-owned or state-sponsored companies, many of which are in very weak financial positions, the report said.</p>
<p>DRI/McGraw Hill made its comments on China as it ranked the relative investment risk of the world's big emerging markets.</p>
<p>Among the 10 countries surveyed, South Africa presented the highest investment risk due to a declining rate of growth and rising unemployment and inflation.</p>
<p>South Africa's mineral and agricultural output is stagnant or falling and consumer debt has reached dangerous proportions, the report said.</p>
<p>While South Africa recently had its sovereign debt rating upgraded and has increased its foreign reserves, &quot;the general dismal fundamentals of the South African government and economy are expected to lead to poor long-term prospects&quot; for the country, it added.</p>
<p>After South Africa and China, the report listed Indonesia, Russia and Brazil, in descending order, as having the highest investment risk.</p>
<p>Argentina, Poland, Mexico, Turkey and India offered the lowest investment risk among the biggest emerging markets, the report said.</p>
