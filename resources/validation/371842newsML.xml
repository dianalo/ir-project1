<title>CANADA: Canadian bonds close weaker after 10-year auction.</title>
<headline>Canadian bonds close weaker after 10-year auction.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1997-02-12</dateline>

<p>Canadian bonds closed weaker on Wednesday, falling in tandem with U.S. Treasuries as the auction of 10-year bonds in both countries weighed on markets, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Canada's auction today was moderate to okay, it was nothing stellar. I think you can blame part of that on signals from the U.S. that suggested that their 10 years was not going to go all that well,&quot; said Jeoff Hall, Canadian market analyst with Technical Data. &quot;Most of the focus was on the States.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year bond fell C$0.13 to C$111.92 to yield 7.001 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year benchmark bond fell 2/32 to yield 6.71 percent. The spread between the benchmark bonds was 29 basis points, unchanged from Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>The Government of Canada's of C$2.3 billion of 7.25 percent bonds due June 1, 2007 produced and average yield of 6.405 percent. Bids from primary dealers totalled C$5.03 billion, including C$67.05 million of non-competitive tenders at the average yield.</p>
<p>While Canadian auction results were considered respectable analysts said poor demand for the U.S. auction of 10-year notes had a dampening effect on markets in both countries.  </p>
<p>The U.S government this afternoon sold US$12 billion in 10-year bonds. Investors there are faced with further supply tomorrow with the final leg of the quarterly refunding, an auction of US$10 billion in 30-year bonds.</p>
<p>In other prices, the Government of Canada's 7.0 percent bond due 2006 fell C$0.09 to C$104.87 to yield 6.323 percent.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill traded with a yield of 2.86 percent against the U.S. bill which yielded 5.14 percent.</p>
