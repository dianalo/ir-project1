<p>Rwanda said on Friday it planned to help rebuild its economy crippled by genocide and civil war through a privatisation programme.</p>
<p>&quot;Our thrust is going to be on privatisation in all sectors. We are setting up a privatisation task force...,&quot; Finance and Economic Planning Minister Donald Kaberuka told Reuters.</p>
<p>Kaberuka was part of a visiting Rwandan government delegation promoting bilateral relations with South Africa and seeking private sector partnerships.</p>
<p>Both countries signed a declaration of intent to begin economic, scientific and technological cooperation, which they hope will stir interest from South Africa's private sector.</p>
<p>The ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front passed a privatisation law in March 1996 and in August cabinet named a variety of state assets for sale.</p>
<p>They included rice, paper, sugar, lime and dairy factories, eight hotels, tea and coffee factories and plantations, and some mines.</p>
<p>Kaberuka said the country had significant methane gas potential on Lake Kivu. South Africa has already shown interest in developing this potential through its chemical's firm Sasol Ltd and its state-owned oil from gas producer Mossgas.</p>
<p>Bids for the sale of the Banana Beverages Plant will be opened in August this year.</p>
<p>The government inherited debt of $1 billion from the previous regime, equal to 91 percent of the country's gross domestic product, but Kaberuka said about 85 percent of this was accumulated through development loans.</p>
<p>&quot;This debt has to be serviced, and so we need to develop our export capacity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The reintegration of over two million Rwandan refugees into the economy is the biggest challenge facing the Rwandan administration.</p>
<p>Kaberuka said the government was relying on private sector investment to help create jobs for those affected by ethnic fighting.</p>
<p>Analysts have estimated that the government needs over $800 million to rebuild Rwanda's economy, and that much of it will have to come from donor money.</p>
<p>&quot;The private sector will be the source of jobs and growth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The World Bank rated Rwanda in 1996 as one of the world's poorest countries. But Kaberuka said the government had already managed to strengthen the economy by bringing down annual inflation to a current nine percent from 22 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>He said coffee production, which dropped to less than 20,000 tonnes annually from 30,000 in 1995, should recover this year to 25,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Most manufacturing companies closed during the genocide in 1994, but Kaberuka said between 75 and 80 percent of productive capacity before the war had been re-established.</p>
<p>He said the government wanted to ensure the country was one day no longer dependent on aid.</p>
