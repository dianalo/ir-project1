<p>Australian non-government parties may combine to force changes to the government's proposed native land ownership legislation, opposition Labor spokesman Daryl Melham said on Monday.</p>
<p>Labor and Australian Democrats members of a parliamentary committee backed a report calling for changes to the government's proposed legislation, which would itself alter the native title system set up by the former Labor government.</p>
<p>&quot;(Democrats leader Cheryl) Kernot signed off on all aspects of the Labor minority report,&quot; Melham told reporters.</p>
<p>The government does not control the Senate. Labor and the Democrats can get the bill amended if three of the other four Independent and Greens senators join them.</p>
<p>Melham said under the government's bill approvals for land developments could be delayed by Aborigines pursuing their common law rights through the courts.</p>
<p>The minority report recommended against the bill's:</p>
<p>-- Registration test for native title applications that would make them more difficult to administer by the Native Title Tribunal;</p>
<p>-- Denying the right to negotiate over development proposals by applicants who do not pass a test for registration;</p>
<p>-- Providing for a once-only right to negotiate over development proposals, effectively covering exploration and mining, and denying native title holders the use of the land;</p>
<p>-- Allowing the minister to intervene in certain circumstances, effectively denying the right to negotiate;</p>
<p>-- Giving the minister authority to permit a development on native title land;</p>
<p>-- Limiting mediation to matters that could be litigated in a court;</p>
<p>-- Limiting the right to negotiate to four months from six months before arbitration over mining could begin;</p>
<p>-- Ending Aborigines' right to stop expedited processing of developments by claiming merely spiritual interference, rather than physical interference;</p>
<p>-- Authorisation of the minister to recognise or deny recognition of native title representative bodies on grounds that the minority report called inadequate.</p>
<p>Melham said he would raise the minority recommendations with his Labor party colleagues shortly.</p>
<p>The bill, the Native Title Amendment Bill will be debated in the lower house of parliament, the House of Representatives, on December 2.</p>
