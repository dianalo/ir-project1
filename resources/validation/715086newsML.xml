<p>Following are some of the leading stories in the Swedish papers on Tuesday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>DAGENS NYHETER</p>
<p>- Swedes owe some 67 billion crowns to the state in back taxes and this number continues to grow. Since 1991 this figure has increased nearly 150 percent. The lion's share of the sum is because of the numerous bankruptcies in the 1990s, which hit a high in 1992 at 23,000.</p>
<p>- Carl Bildt, leader of the opposition Moderate Party, is featured in a column about ethics in politics. He says although sometimes it is necessary to hide the whole truth he hopes people will say about him that he never lied.</p>
<p>- Insurance company Skandia's share price rose sharply on Monday because of good sales by its U.S. subsidiary AFS and increased interest for the unit.</p>
<p>SVENSKA DAGBLADET</p>
<p>- Large Swedish companies pay their civil engineers more poorly than small or medium sized companies, a survey shows. Among large companies only appliance maker Electrolux pays slightly above the national average. They make 3,000 to 4,000 crowns more per month than their collegues at telecoms group Ericsson, rollerbearing maker SKF and vehicle maker Volvo for example.</p>
<p>- Two advertisements for jeans company Diesel produced by Swedish advertising company Paradiset won the most prestigeous prizes in the industry, the Grand Prix at Cannes. U.S. advertising publication Advertising Age says Scandinavia has become a hotbed of creativity.</p>
<p>- Finance Minister Erik Asbrink says Sweden's decision to stay outside Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU) was a good one considering uncertainty surrounding the project.</p>
<p>DAGENS INDUSTRI</p>
<p>- Published only on Fridays for the next three weeks because of the summer holiday.</p>
