<p>Single European currency optimism has driven Italian and Spanish debt yields forcefully lower but investors should be wary of keeping long positions in these markets beyond the short term, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A dazzling performance by Italian BTPs in recent days has pushed the 10-year yield gap to Bunds below 200 basis points to 190, its lowest level ever, and Spanish Bonos have sliced almost 120 basis points off their gap to Bunds since May.</p>
<p>That yield spread is now 165 basis points, more than 20 basis points below the British-German 10-year gap.</p>
<p>But prospects for more of this outperformance, almost solely down to anticipation that the two southern Europeans will join in EU economic and monetary union (EMU) in 1999, now lies in the balance of belief, said Sally Wilkinson, economist at UBS in London.</p>
<p>&quot;If you truly believe Italy and Spain will participate in monetary union in 1999 then yes, the rally will continue, because by the end of 1998 those spreads will have to be close to zero,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is a question of whether you really believe it.&quot;</p>
<p>While all the noises at the moment are helping Italian and Spanish debt -- with upbeat comments from French President Jacques Chirac on Tuesday -- analysts said the risk was that BTPs and Bonos were heading for rougher times in the early part of next year.</p>
<p>Chirac said he had &quot;no doubt&quot; Spain would be among the single currency starters. But he was less specific about Italy, saying only that he would like Italy to participate from the EMU planned start date of January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>Adrian Owens, European economist at Julius Baer Investments in London, said the distinction between the two Mediterranean EMU contenders was becoming more pronounced.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a bit reluctant to group Italy and Spain in the same camp,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is going to be very difficult to exclude Spain (from EMU) because in terms of their fundamentals they are pretty much on course to meet the Maastricht criteria -- and any fudges in the Spanish budget are no greater than in the French budget.&quot;</p>
<p>But with Italy he said investors should be a little more dubious of its chances of getting into the 1999 party, mainly because of its national debt burden.</p>
<p>European Commission forecasts released on Wednesday projected Italy's debt to GDP ratio would be 122.3 percent in 1997 -- more than double the 60 percent level targeted by the Maastricht Treaty -- while its deficit to GDP ratio would be 3.3 percent, just missing the EMU 3.0 percent reference value.</p>
<p>Forecasts for Spain were more encouraging. There, the Commission said it saw a debt-to-GDP level of 67.1 percent and deficit-to-GDP at 3.0 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>In the short term, analysts said there was room at least for some consolidation on high-yielding spreads to Bunds, with maybe the chance for a little more outperformance.</p>
<p>David Brown, economist at Bear Stearns in London, said the 10-year Bono/Bund gap would tighten to 150 basis points as the 1997 budget was approved and inflation continued to fall.</p>
<p>For Italy, Brown said the two caveats to outperformance would be the lira's re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) and approval of the 1997 budget -- both of which he expected in the near term. Beyond there, the BTP/Bund gap could snap in to 150 basis points within a few months, he said.</p>
<p>But UBS's Wilkinson said both Italian and Spanish debt markets may be in for a shock early next year, when she thought some kind of catalyst would send them into reverse.</p>
<p>&quot;We still hold the view that EMU will have a hard core of six or seven countries (excluding Italy and Spain) at the beginning and once that realisation comes, there will be a sell-off,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Something has to give. And the sooner that it happens the better, because the further the rally goes, the more vigorous the sell-off is going to be.&quot;</p>
<p>Agreeing that there was a risk for Italian debt markets, Owens said a setback was probably on the cards, but he said any spread widening against Bunds was likely to be limited to around 50 basis points of underperformance by BTPs.</p>
