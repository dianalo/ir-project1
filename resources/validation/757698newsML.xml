<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle bids early Friday at $64.00 per cwt were passed by owners asking $65.00 for any cattle remaining following this week's active trade, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Several cattle feeders said some owners were passing bids in anticipation of $65.00 sales next week.</p>
<p>Fed cattle prices next week were seen supported by smaller numbers on the showlist and outlooks for firm beef prices, the feeder sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;After the volume we had this week, the list will come down,&quot; one Kansas feedlot manager said.  </p>
<p>After dipping $0.28 per cwt on Wednesday, heavyweight choice beef rebounded $0.46 on Thursday to close at $103.27, up $4.23 since prices started trending higher on July 11, USDA statistics showed.</p>
<p>The brisk pace of this week's cattle sales, coupled with the rebound in beef values on Thursday fueled, optimisim for higher fed cattle prices next week, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Weekly movement in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area was pegged near 131,000 head and movement in Kansas was estimated near 95,000, according to USDA.</p>
