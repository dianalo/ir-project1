<p>Canadian T-bills opened mixed in quiet trade on Wednesday, with the market seen trading in a narrow range for the rest of the session.</p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow should be a busy day so I think the market's going to take a breather to try to get things in order and figure out what they're going to do for tomorrow. And with no main numbers today we're probably just going to drift,&quot; said one T-bill trader with a bank-owned brokerage.</p>
<p>Canada's three-month when-issued T-bill softened to yield 3.34 percent from 3.33 percent from the close of trading on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Tomorrow will see C$7.9 billion of T-bills mature, an unusually high number because of a C$3.0 billion 35-day cash management T-bill auctioned on July 2.</p>
<p>The trader said much of that money could remain in the very short end of the money market yield curve, keeping short term T-bill prices well-bid.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Canadian money market is also coming to terms by the Canadian government's announcement yesterday that it will move to T-bill auctions every other week rather than every week. The move is aimed at increasing liquidity in the money market.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think it's going to help permit more liquidity in the cash and WI (when-issued) markets, but we're still trying to figure out what that's going to do to the current bill inventories,&quot; the T-bill trader said.</p>
<p>In other prices, the six-month cash T-bill softened to yield 3.73 percent from 3.71 percent on Tuesday. The one-year when-issued T-bill softened to yield 4.26 percent from 4.25 percent.</p>
<p>The call loan or overnight lending rate traded at 3.25 percent, the center of the Bank of Canada's 3.0-3.5 percent target range.</p>
