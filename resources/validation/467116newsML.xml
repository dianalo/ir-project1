<p>The influx of food supplies to Iraq under an oil-for-food deal with the United Nations has forced prices down in Baghdad and sent the local dinar currency soaring against the dollar.</p>
<p>Traders said on Tuesday that the greenback plummeted to less than 1,000 dinars from 1,250 early in the week. Feverish selling of the dollar in last days was set to push the dinar up even further, they added.</p>
<p>U.N. sources in Baghdad said supplies were now reaching Iraq through the border post of Treibeel with Jordan. They said the first shipment of 1,500 tonnes of salt had crossed the border.</p>
<p>&quot;Soon three entry points will be active under (U.N. resolution) 986. Now we have supplies coming via Khabur crossing from Turkey, Treibeel border point from Jordan and later today a ship with 13,000 tonnes of rice will dock at Umm Qas port,&quot; one U.N. source said.</p>
<p>Under the U.N. deal, based on resolution 986, Iraq is allowed to sell $2 billion worth of oil every six months to buy humanitarian needs for Iraqis, suffering from U.N. sanctions imposed for Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>Food deliveries were still meagre compared to the needs of the sanctions-hit nation of more than 20 million people.</p>
<p>Iraq's trade ministry says it needs about 250,000 tonnes of food supplies to be able to hand out a full basket of rations for a month. So far only 15,000 tonnes of food have arrived in the country but U.N. sources said stocks would build up soon with the arrival of ships carrying French and Australian wheat by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Uncertainty about the arrival of supplies and approval of contracts under the deal had sent food prices soaring in Baghdad and local currency plummeting early in March.</p>
<p>The dollar at one point rose to more than 1,300 dinars and a tray of 30 eggs fetched about 3,000, almost equal to a civil servant's monthly salary.</p>
<p>Traders in Baghdad said prices were on the decline and a tray of eggs could be bought now for 1,650 dinars.</p>
<p>A kilo of cooking oil fell to about 800 dinars from 1,200 and flour dropped to 400 from 600.</p>
