<p>The Hong Kong government said on Wednesday it would slash the advertising royalties paid by Television Broadcasts Ltd (TVB) and Asia Television Ltd (ATV), which could save the two broadcasters about HK$65 million.</p>
<p>The new scale of advertising royalties would cut the top rate from 10 percent to nine percent, the government said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;On the basis of advertising revenues in 1995/96, this would save ATV about HK$45 million a year, while TVB, which will benefit from the cut in the top rate, would save about HK$20 million,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>But the government said it would introduce full-cost licence fees which would result in fees soaring from the present nominal charges of $1,000.</p>
<p>The government said the new fees would reflect the costs incurred by the government's watchdog Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority and the Office of the Telecommunications Authority in administering their licences, including monitoring television broadcasts and ensuring compliance with licence conditions and codes of practice.</p>
<p>The full-cost licence fees will be phased in over a five-year period. In 1997, ATV and TVB will have to pay 20 percent of the assessed full cost, and in 1998, they would pay 40 percent of assessed full cost, and so on until full-cost recovery is achieved in 2001.</p>
<p>The new licence fees will amount to about $1.8 million for each licensee for the year starting from January 1, 1997, it said.</p>
<p>The new fees will be introduced with effect from December 1, subject ot approval of the regulation by the Legislative Council.</p>
<p>ATV is 16.67 percent owned by Lai Sun Development Co Ltd .</p>
