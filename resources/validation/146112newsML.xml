<title>RUSSIA: Yeltsin expels former bodyguard from army - tv.</title>

<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin dealt his former bodyguard Alexander Korzhakov another blow on Sunday by signing a decree expelling him from the armed forces, Russian television reported.</p>
<p>Korzhakov, who had the rank of general, worked for Yeltsin for 11 years until the Russian leader sacked him in June as part of a Kremlin power struggle.</p>
<p>The presidential administration could not immediately be contacted to confirm the report but a spokesman for Russian television said the story had come from Kremlin sources.</p>
<p>The expulsion is unlikely to have much effect, since Korzhakov is now out of the Kremlin. But it marks a new low in relations between two men who until recently were almost inseparable but now have little love for each other.</p>
<p>Korzhakov told the German weekly Der Spiegel on Saturday that Yeltsin, who is awaiting heart surgery, had been too ill to work properly weeks before the first round of presidential elections in June.</p>
<p>Korzhakov appears to have formed an alliance with former security chief General Alexander Lebed, sacked by Yeltsin earlier this month in a speech during which he made derogatory comments about his former bodyguard.</p>
<p>No one has written off Korzhakov, 46, who is preparing to stand in an election to the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, and claims to have huge numbers of documents compromising his opponents.</p>
<p>During Korzhakov's time in the Kremlin, opponents regularly accused the bull-like former KGB general of limiting access to Yeltsin and of amassing influence on policy issues.</p>
<p>Yeltsin did little to rein in his bodyguard but was forced to act after allegations that Korzhakov wanted to derail the second round of the presidential election.</p>
<p>Korzhakov had been close to the Kremlin leader since he was assigned to be his bodyguard in 1985 when Yeltsin was Moscow Communist Party chief.</p>
<p>Reports thatr Korzhakov was a Kremlin &quot;grey eminence&quot; with an unusually broad portfolio emerged last year when he denounced World Bank proposals to reform Russia's oil export system in a letter addressed to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
