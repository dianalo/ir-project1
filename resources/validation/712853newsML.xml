<p>Hungary expects to meet its 1997 government budget deficit target despite a larger than planned gap in the social security budget, the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not have a reason to modify our government budget deficit forecast of 4.9 percent (of the gross domestic product),&quot; Deputy State Secretary Csaba Laszlo told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said social security was likely to post a larger than planned deficit in 1997 but its impact on the government budget would be probably offset by the improving position of government funds and the central state budget.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) all said recently that Hungary's economy was recovering but the social security deficit was still too high.</p>
<p>The social security gap was 21.3 billion forints in March, well above the 13.5 billion forints targeted for the whole year.</p>
<p>Laszlo said the current deficit of social security was not a serious problem.</p>
<p>&quot;If we suppose the social security deficit will be 40 billion forints (in 1997), this is still a small part of the deficit of the central state budget,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hungary targets a central state budget gap of 360 billion forints without privatisation revenues and the deficit stood at 165 billion forints in June, up from 150 billion in May.</p>
<p>Laszlo said the ministry expected the deficit to widen by 20 to 30 billion forints each month in July, August and September, and the final 1997 central state budget deficit was likely to remain 20 to 30 billion forints below the plan.</p>
<p>Although the country was likely to meet its overall government deficit target, the ministry believes that keeping the social security deficit at bay was essential as for the longer term it can produce a &quot;snowball effect&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>The pension reform, to be approved by the parliament this month, will prevent the accumulation of large deficits at the social security pension fund, while the government negotiates with the health care fund about how its deficit could be cut, Laszlo added.</p>
<p>&quot;We also want all areas to keep to the budgetary limits approved by the parliament,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>NBH president Gyorgy Suranyi said recently that Hungary will have to reduce its government deficit from 4.9 percent of GDP from 1999 so as to cut inflation to single digits.</p>
