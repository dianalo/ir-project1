<p>German car maker Bayerische Motoren Werke plans to launch its 5-series cars in 1997 in India, where it sees big business potential along with the rest of Asia, chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be possibly starting within the end of next year manufacture of the middle-class, 5-series model in India,&quot; Pischetsrieder told reporters in the Indian capital.</p>
<p>BMW has previously said it wanted to assemble vehicles in India and last month it won Indian government approval to take 51 percent in a joint venture with the Hero group. Other details have not been worked out, company officials said.</p>
<p>Pischetsrieder said BMW's market share in Asia was at its lowest, compared with other regions, adding that there was big scope for its luxury cars.</p>
<p>But he said BMW's strategy was to proceed cautiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody in our industry is concentrating on what we call emerging markets,&quot; Pischetsrieder said.</p>
<p>&quot;We as a company clearly think we don't want to dump cars without being able to give technical support,&quot; he said. &quot;We are clearly determined to go on the slow, sustainable growth route.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are not in a position to say we will sell thousands of cars next year,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Company officials said BMW was likely to launch its 5-series 2.5 litre capacity, diesel-engine cars in India in collaboration with India's Hero group but the amount of the investment had not been finalised with the Indian government.</p>
<p>They said the cars, priced at around $40,000 in the U.S. middle-class market, would qualify for an upper market segment in India where disposable incomes were comparitively lower.</p>
<p>&quot;Our market segment has to be developed,&quot; said Luden Paysen, group executive in-charge of emerging markets in BMW's sales division.</p>
<p>BMW is already assembling and selling its motorcycles in India in collaboration with the Hero group.</p>
