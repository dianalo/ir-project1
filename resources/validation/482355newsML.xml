<p>French missiles-to-publishing conglomerate Lagardere said on Wednesday its net attributable profit jumped 65 percent last year to 1.04 billion francs ($185 million) and should rise again in 1997.</p>
<p>Net profit, before payments to minorities, was 1.43 billion francs in 1996, up from 1.09 billion, reflecting higher sales and sharply improved profitability in its defence and high tech activities.</p>
<p>Lagardere raised its net dividend to 3.70 francs per share from three francs for 1995.</p>
<p>As for the current year, &quot;we may not have a (profit) rise as strong as that of 1996, but we do see a rise,&quot; finance director Philippe Camus told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless there is a significant change in the French or international economy, the group's results should continue to progress this year,&quot; Lagardere said in its earnings statement.</p>
<p>It said the anticipated increase reflected a full order book for high tech activities, the success of the new Renault Espace minivan, and increased profitability expected at the multimedia Grolier branch. It said the dollar's rise and lower paper prices were favourable for its media activities.</p>
<p>Operating profit at the high tech division, which includes the Matra missiles business, surged 116 percent last year from low 1995 levels. The operating profit of the media branch, which include the magazines Elle, Car and Driver and Woman's Day, rose 11 percent.</p>
<p>Profits at the auto and transport branch slumped 88 percent because of the costs associatied with the new Espace minivan built jointly by Lagardere and carmaker Renault SA.</p>
<p>Lagardere's financial expense rose to 193 million francs last year from 155 million. Camus said the rise was due in a part to a provision taken last year on Lagardere's 1.5 percent stake in ailing Renault, which lost 5.25 billion francs in 1996.</p>
