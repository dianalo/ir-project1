<p>Tamil Tiger separatists said on Saturday they plan to commemorate their suicide fighters lost in attacks against the Sri Lanka military, by lighting lamps and holding public meetings in northern rebel-held areas.</p>
<p>The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels said in a statement from London that lamps equal in number to the &quot;Black Tigers&quot; who have died, will be lit in their memory on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The portraits of 'Black Tigers' will be decorated with garlands and honoured in celebrations held in several halls in the Wanni,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The LTTE, who are fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east, commemorate July 5 as &quot;Black Tigers Day&quot; in memory of three fighters who led the first successful suicide attack against the military a decade ago.</p>
<p>The separatists drove a vehicle filled with explosives into a school building housing an army camp in northern Jaffna on July 5, 1987, killing several soldiers.</p>
<p>Since then several more &quot;Black Tigers&quot; have led suicide attacks against military and civilian targets. Most LTTE fighters also carry a cyanide capsule around their necks, which they bite to escape capture by the military.</p>
<p>Security in the capital Colombo and elsewhere in Sri Lanka was tightened on the weekend in anticipation of fresh attacks as the rebels began commemorating their dead.</p>
<p>Several new military checkpoints in security-conscious Colombo have sprung up in the past week.</p>
<p>Military officials said troops were on high alert for attacks by the rebels in the northern Wanni region, where the army is attempting to open a strategic highway to link northern Jaffna peninsula with the rest of the island.</p>
<p>Some 20,000 troops launched Operation &quot;Jaya Sikuru&quot; or &quot;Sure of Victory&quot;, in May to wrest control of the highway that runs through the rebel heartland.</p>
<p>July is a critical month for Sri Lanka as the rebels commemorate several events that have special significance to the 13-year-old conflict.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka's ethnic war started after the LTTE killed 13 soldiers in Jaffna in July 1983. Islandwide anti-Tamil riots followed, claiming at least 400 lives.</p>
<p>Last year the rebels overran a large military camp in northeastern Mullaitivu amid reports they killed or captured the entire garrison of more than 1,000 troops.</p>
