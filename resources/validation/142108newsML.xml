<title>MALAYSIA: Bank Negara imposes new limits for motor insurance.</title>
<headline>Bank Negara imposes new limits for motor insurance.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-10-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Malaysian central bank said on Thursday that it will impose new limits on loading and &quot;excess&quot; for motor insurance from November 1 this year.</p>
<p>In a statement, Bank Negara said the limits are proposed pending a review of the tariff and third party classes of motor insurance.  </p>
<p>The central bank said the new limits will be imposed to reduce the element of subsidy to third party insurance.</p>
<p>Third party insurance refers to an insurance policy which only allows other vehicles involved in an accident with the insured vehicle to submit claims.</p>
<p>Bank Negara said the limits imposed on loading will be determined on the basis of common underwriting criteria such as age of vehicle, driver's characteristics and on claims' experience.</p>
<p>Motor insurance loading refers to the additional premium charged on second-hand cars.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is only fair that a person who makes claims should pay a higher premium as compared to a person who does not make any claim,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The loading related to claims will only operate if a vehicle owner makes two or more claims during the preceding two years. Accordingly, the loading for comprehensive insurance, especially for a vehicle owner who makes no claim, will be reduced,&quot; Bank Negara said.</p>
<p>Caps will also be placed on &quot;excess&quot; applicable to claims. Excess refers to the amount a vehicle owner has to pay himself from a repair bill which he submits to the insurance company.  </p>
<p>Bank Negara said it was limitting the excess to a maximum 2.5 percent of the insured value.</p>
<p>It said the excess applicable to third party claims has caused &quot;considerable inconvenience to third party claimants in making recovery on damage to their vehicles&quot;.</p>
<p>It said in some incidents, claimants &quot;have been unable to make any recovery at all due to the high excess applied to the vehicle owners who had caused the damage&quot;.</p>
<p>Bank Negara said an exercise to review the claims experience for different classes of vehicles and for different scopes of cover is currently in progress.</p>
