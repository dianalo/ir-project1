<title>MEXICO: Mexico stocks recover, close up on inflation, peso.</title>
<headline>Mexico stocks recover, close up on inflation, peso.</headline>

<p>Mexican stocks reversed initial losses to close up on Wednesday, boosted by lower-than-expected inflation figures and the peso weakening to what traders saw as a more realistic level against the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;The bolsa suddenly woke up from the siesta it took after last week's rally,&quot; said Jaime Fernandez, technical analyst at the Interacciones brokerage.</p>
<p>The blue chip IPC index closed up 32.69 points, or 0.98 percent, at 3,372.80. Volume, albeit not remarkable, was much better than on Monday and Tuesday at 69.98 million shares traded.  </p>
<p>&quot;The exchange rate helped, I think 7.59 per dollar is a good rate for the peso. Today's inflation figures were good, too. The recent slide made the bolsa gather steam to rebound well at the ten-day moving average, at 3,333 points,&quot; said Fernandez.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso earlier closed 4.1 centavos weaker at 7.5850/7.5890. Banco de Mexico also announced that consumer inflation for September was 1.60 percent, compared to an average forecast of 1.66 percent.</p>
<p>Some traders said stocks responded to dealers picking up bargains, spurred by the favorable outlook for some third quarter earnings reports soon to be released.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are dealers beginning to step in ahead of reports, looking at prices and seeing they are attractive,&quot; said a floor trader. Supermarket chain Gigante, the most heavily traded stock among the first five percentage gainers, was a good example of this type of trading.</p>
<p>Three series of insurance firm Vamsa led the gainers, but at low volume in what is an infrequently traded stock.</p>
<p>Two series of autoparts firm Iasasa headed the losers, as they have in other recent sessions.</p>
<p>On the broad market, gainers outnumbered losers by 61 to 32, respectively, out of a total of 109 stocks traded.</p>
