<p>Israeli shares closed lower on Thursday for the third consecutive session on low volume as political uncertainty and the sharp decline of the shekel depressed prices, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares ended down 0.87 percent, or 2.52 points, to 285.50 on low all-share turnover of 150 million shekels against 170 million shekels on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index closed 0.90 percent lower at 293.02.</p>
<p>&quot;There is much political and economic uncertainty and this is bad for the market. The latest events indicate that the government may not last much longer,&quot; said Arik Rotstein of Bloch Rotstein Securities and Investments. &quot;The rapid decline of the shekel is only adding to investor uncertainty.&quot;</p>
<p>Israeli President Ezer Weizman urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet on Thursday to stop squabbling and get back to work on Middle East peace-making.</p>
<p>Two ministers have quit in anger. Others have refused to speak to Netanyahu and boycotted cabinet meetings while several coalition members abandoned him in a parliamentary no-confidence vote this week.</p>
<p>The shekel has fallen sharply since last Friday, shortly after the government announced a reform of the exchange rate regime and the Bank of Israel lowered the base rate by a steep 1.2 percentage points to 12.7 percent.</p>
<p>But Rotstein said a sharp decline of the shekel might lead to higher inflation and even to a decision of the Bank of Israel to raise its key lending rate.</p>
<p>&quot;If the devaluation of the shekel continues this will have an immediate impact on the results of companies that took foreign currency loans,&quot; Rotstein said.</p>
<p>Danni Scharia of Capital Securities said the Bank of Israel must intervene in the forex market. &quot;If he doesn't stop the shekel's fall it could snowball,&quot; he said. &quot;It will also worsen the condition of many companies, which are about the publish their results.&quot;</p>
<p>Rotstein said the recent decline of the market could also be seen as a technical correction.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that activity is also falling supports the feeling that this is only a correction. I believe that the Mishtanim will stop at around 270 points and the Maof at 280,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Scharia agreed and is more optimistic about the Maof's floor. &quot;The slide will stop once the Maof reaches 290 points. We haven't seen such low activity for a long time and that's a clear indicator that it's only a correction,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The most active shares were Koor Industries, which fell 2.0 percent to 32,064 agorot on volume of 12 million shekels; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which gained 2.5 percent to 22,864 agorot on turnover of 10.9 million shekels; and Bank Leumi, which lost 2.0 percent at 552 agorot on turnover of 9.3 million shekels.</p>
