<p>The French Socialists' sweeping election victory need not delay European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) despite concerns over economic policy raised in the campaign, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;One would have to be worried if the points that have been made in the course of the campaign, as far as economic policies are concerned, should be translated into actual action on the part of France,&quot; Dini told a news conference with Czech counterpart Josef Zieleniec during an official visit to Prague.</p>
<p>&quot;That would inevitably go into conflict with policies designed for convergence and therefore for the start of monetary union...This is not going to be necessarily so,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Socialists have said they are committed to EMU but with conditions, including a flexible interpretation of the Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>Dini said France would require Europe to do more to stimulate employment. But he said many in the Socialist Party were committed to the existing timetable for EMU and EU enlargement.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand that also in the Socialist Party the voice of Europe, of those who would want to keep pace with the programme and the calendar which has been set for the completion of the IGC (EU Inter-Governmental Conference on institutional reform) and also of the monetary union, is very strong.&quot;</p>
<p>Dini said Italy fully supported Czech plans to join both the European Union and NATO.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic is seen as among the leading contenders to be among the first new members both of NATO and the EU.</p>
