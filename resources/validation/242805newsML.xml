<p>Former U.S. and British Open champion Tony Jacklin narrowly missed election into the World Golf Hall of Fame as no international players mustered enough votes for induction, officials said Monday.</p>
<p>The inaugural International Ballot for membership in the hall required 75 percent of returned ballots from a world-wide panel of writers, golf officials and dignitaries. Jacklin was named on 73.75 percent of ballots returned by the 354-member voting body.</p>
<p>Next closest of the 33 players who qualified for the first International Ballot was Isao Aoki of Japan with 65.6 percent, followed by Australian Kel Nagle (53.3), Christy O'Connor, Sr of Ireland (43.9), Ayako Okamoto of Japan (40.2), Jumbo Ozaki of Japan (39.3) and Neil Coles of England (31.6).</p>
<p>The World Golf Hall of Fame, which will also house the Hall of Fames of the PGA Tour and LPGA Tour, is scheduled to open during the spring of 1998 in St. Johns County, Florida.</p>
<p>In order to qualify for the international ballot, a player must be at least 40 years old and accumulate a minimum of 50 points on a schedule based on points for international victories and certain team participation.</p>
<p>The 1997 ballot will include current European stars Seve Ballesteros of Spain, Briton Nick Faldo and Bernhard Langer of Germany, each of whom turns 40 prior to the next election.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Johnny Miller was the lone player to enter the Hall of Fame this season through the PGA Tour ballot.</p>
