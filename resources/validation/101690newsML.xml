<p>New York precious metals futures ended mostly higher Tuesday, as the complex continued to attempt a recovery from a month-long downtrend.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a plodding recovery though in the past week, hardly a heroic effort,&quot; Chase Manhattan New York based managing director Dinsa Mehta said.</p>
<p>&quot;The selling has been absorbed, gold equity funds have been adding bullion to their portfolios, and fabricator demand has picked up, but the big fund shorts are still in market, and the recovery is likely to remain mild unless large scale fund shortcovering occurs,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The most recent CFTC Commitment of Traders data showed funds with record net short positions, analysts noted.</p>
<p>COMEX December gold ended up 80 cents at $383.40 an ounce, after trading in a $382.60-384.30 range.</p>
<p>In bullion trade, spot gold ended quoted $381.10/381.60 an ounce, compared to the London Monday afternoon at $380.85, and Monday's New York close at $380.35/380.85.</p>
<p>COMEX gold stocks fell 2,025 ounces Monday to 1,118,488 ounces, the ninth straight day of falls in warehouse stocks.</p>
<p>COMEX December silver ended up 1.0 cent at $4.898 an ounce, after trading in a $4.890-4.925 range.</p>
<p>COMEX silver stocks fell 1,149,955 ounces to 139,493,089 ounces Monday.</p>
<p>NYMEX January platinum ended up 20 cents at $388.80 while NYMEX December palladium ended down 50 cents at $119.25.</p>
<p>But with the December 1996/December 1997 gold spread threatening to break below its $14.00-17.00 an ounce range of the past nine months, producers may be tempted to hedge on any bounces, keeping pressure on the precious metals complex, analysts said.</p>
<p>Investor demand for precious metals is also still seen limited by low inflation and surging U.S. equity and debt markets, while industrial and investor demand in other countries has been restrained by a strong U.S. dollar pushing up the cost of precious metals in local currencies, analysts said.</p>
