<p>Heart bypass surgery patients who were given a drug that boosts the body's defenses after an operation were less likely to suffer a subsequent heart attack or stroke, researchers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based researcher Dennis Mangano, who founded two research organizations dedicated to studying heart surgery, said his analysis of five separate trials found the bioengineered drug acadesine reduced by half the total number of post-operative deaths within four days of surgery.</p>
<p>Acadesine is made by San Diego, California-based Gensia Inc., which provided a grant to Mangano's Ischemia Research and Education Foundation and the Multicenter Study of Perioperative Ischemia Research Group.</p>
<p>The company funded the five seperate studies dating back to 1990 but the studies did not provide the results needed to satisfy all Food and Drug Administration criteria for successful trials. A spokesman said it was looking to license the drug to another firm that could fund a larger study.</p>
<p>Mangano said the five trials together looked at 4,043 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery at 81 medical centers in the United States, Canada and Europe. Within four days of the surgery, 13 of those taking acadesine suffered heart-related deaths compared with 26 of those given a placebo.</p>
<p>Heart attacks were suffered by 98 patients given the placebo, 13 of whom died, vs. 71 patients in the acadesine group, of whom one died. Strokes were reported among 47 of the placebo-takers, compared with 32 in the drug-taking group.</p>
<p>The drug stimulates production of naturally occurring chemical hormone adenosine, a building block of DNA that researchers believe enhances the body's natural defense after heart surgery.</p>
