<p>Its grip on world diamond markets might be slipping but De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd is determined to grab hold of Asia's exploding demand for the glittering gems.</p>
<p>&quot;Generally the trend is fantastic,&quot; Phillip Dobbs, Asian representative for the diamond giant, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;(Demand is) growing more in line with (gross domestic product) in the region -- which of course is greater than that in Europe and America.&quot;</p>
<p>The Asian market is critical for De Beers, whose diamond selling cartel is now under threat from new mines in the Canadian Arctic slated to supply up to 12 percent of world production soon after start-up in 1998.</p>
<p>Most experts expect the Canadian mines to sell most of their production outside De Beers' Central Selling Organisation (CSO), which has controlled prices and kept them stable for more than 100 years through tight pacts with diamond producers.</p>
<p>&quot;The point is quite clearly that if a number of producers choose not to sell to the CSO then for certain types of diamonds the market will become weaker,&quot; Dobbs said.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be all sorts of consequences, but essentially producers won't benefit to the same extent that they would by selling diamonds through a single channel,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asia's expanding market could meet the new supply.</p>
<p>South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand already rank among the world's 10 largest diamond consuming markets, while huge populations in China and Indonesia are bound to stimulate further demand, Dobbs said.</p>
<p>A whistle-stop tour of Asia by CSO president Anthony Oppenheimer, now in Jakarta, is evidence of how seriously the company takes the Asian market, he said.</p>
<p>Dobbs denied that Oppenheimer's visit indicated any promising diamond prospects in Asia, which accounts for only a couple of small, independent producers.</p>
