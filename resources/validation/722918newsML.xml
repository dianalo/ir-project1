<p>The sixth consecutive monthly drop in U.S. wholesale prices shows inflation at the producer level is missing in action from the U.S. economy and points to at least another couple of months of stable official interest rates, experts said.</p>
<p>The government reported today that the Producer Price Index fell 0.1 percent in June. Excluding its volatile food and energy components, so-called &quot;core PPI&quot; edged up 0.1 percent.  </p>
<p>Economists had forecast that PPI would be flat and that the &quot;core&quot; rate would be up 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a no-inflation world,&quot; said Sandy Batten, economist at Citicorp Global Finance N.A. &quot;You have to go back to the early 1950s to have a similar period with a negative PPI.&quot;</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said the 0.1 percent drop in overall PPI was a record sixth consecutive monthly decline.</p>
<p>The previous record was the five-month string from August to December 1952.</p>
<p>Because the market had anticipated a favorable PPI report, bond prices did not rally on the news.  </p>
<p>Minutes before PPI was released, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 9/32 to 101-2/32, yielding 6.54 percent.</p>
<p>Bond prices have been rallying for some time as investors bank on a scenario of slower economic growth and subdued inflation.</p>
<p>In the tradition of &quot;buying the rumor and selling the fact,&quot; bond prices wiped out early gains after the PPI news. Half an hour after the PPI report, the 30-year bond was unchanged at 100-25/32, yielding 6.56 percent.</p>
<p>Even at the intermediate and crude levels of production, the June report showed price pressures were quiet.  </p>
<p>PPI was unchanged at the intermediate production level and up 0.1 percent excluding food and energy components.</p>
<p>At the earliest crude production stage, PPI fell 3.3 percent but rose 0.4 percent excluding food and energy.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing in this report that gives any indication that inflation pressures are either in, or are being built up in, the economy,&quot; said Batten. &quot;In terms of inflation, it's just a world that we're not familiar with.&quot;</p>
<p>The absence of inflation shows the Federal Reserve's decisions in May and July not to raise interest rates were soundly based, and the data point to a similar decision at the Fed's August 19 policy meeting, economists said.</p>
<p>Inflation in the goods-producing sector &quot;has been wrung out completely,&quot; said David Jones, vice chairman and chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;It vindicates the Fed, particularly Chairman (Alan) Greenspan, in its decision to keep policy unchanged at the policy meetings in May and July, and it suggests that the Fed can keep rates unchanged at the next policy meeting on August 19,&quot; said Jones.</p>
