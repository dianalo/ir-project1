<p>Gateway Data Sciences Corp said Friday it expects earnings per share in the range of $0.01 to $0.03, including restructuring charges and executive compensation, for the second quarter ended July 31.</p>
<p>In addition, the company said it is cutting 22 percent of its workforce.</p>
<p>The company said it expects operating expenses to be up &quot;significantly&quot; from the comparable period of a year ago as it continues to increase its investment in software product development and sales and marketing infrastructure.</p>
<p>It said, however, that operating expenses have been reduced through cuts in admistrative staff and adjustments in compensation plans for certain executives.</p>
<p>The company said it expects software revenue to be lower than it was in the same period a year ago as it continues to transition its new products. It said it expects consulting services revenue to be up from the comparable period.</p>
<p>The company also said it expects revenue from third-party products to be down from the comparable period a year ago, although with improved gross margins.</p>
<p>The company said it expects to report its results during the second half of August.</p>
