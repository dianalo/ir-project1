<p>German phone titan Deutsche Telekom made a splash on the Tokyo stock market on Tuesday, as Japanese investors and dealers joined the rush to trade the newly listed share.</p>
<p>The stock was the most popular on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), with five million Deutsche Telekom shares changing hands in the morning session as Japan joined the trading frenzy seen in Europe and the United States on Monday.</p>
<p>However, the share price slipped a little from its Tokyo debut level as the post-launch buying spree seen on overseas bourses invited some profit-taking in the Tokyo time zone.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue was popular even before it listed all over the world,&quot; said Tadahiro Kamogawa, general manager of the stock information department at Yamaichi Securities. &quot;It's only natural that the shares got off to a good start here, carrying over the enthusiasm from Frankfurt and New York.&quot;</p>
<p>Trade in Deutsche Telekom easily outpaced that in domestic shares, with hotel operator Gajoen Kanko the most heavily traded domestic issue with 3.15 million shares traded on the first section of the Tokyo bourse.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom shares made their debut on the foreign stocks section of the Tokyo bourse at 2,500 yen ($23). However after 10 minutes of furious trade, the shares had slipped down to as low as 2,430 yen on profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors who had bought in overseas markets sold off in Tokyo today, inflating the trade volume as a result,&quot; a broker at a second-tier brokerage said.</p>
<p>Brokers added that as the yen-conversion of the Frankfurt closing share price was about 2,520 yen, some market participants, especially dealers, were preventing the price from falling past the 2,400 yen level.</p>
<p>&quot;This sort of price and volume movement is typical of newly listed foreign stocks in Japan,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>The formerly state-owned firm's listing on the TSE is the first by a U.S. or European company since 1993. Nearly five years ago the exchange prided itself on having 127 foreign issues, but low liquidity, huge costs and the strong yen against the dollar forced many to leave.</p>
<p>So far this year, 11 firms have delisted, and after Exxon Corp leaves in December, only 66 will be left, TSE officials said.</p>
<p>Telekom officials said they were attracted to Japan as it is the second-largest capital market in the world after New York.</p>
<p>The shares were first listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange priced at 28.5 marks ($19) in what was Europe's biggest ever flotation. They started trade on Monday at a 16.5 percent premium and closed at 33.90 marks, with about 38 million shares traded.</p>
<p>Trade on Wall Street was also heady, with the issue closing 14 percent higher at 2-39/64 above the $21-1/2 pricing and with million shares traded. ($1=111 yen, 1.50 marks)</p>
