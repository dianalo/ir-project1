<title>ROMANIA: Romania leu ends down, money market rates up.</title>
<headline>Romania leu ends down, money market rates up.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1997-02-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Romania's leu ended Wednesday softer with dealers' quotes ranging from 8,000/100 to 8,355/455 to the dollar against 8,000/8,050 to 8,200/300 in early trading on an interbank market still facing hard currency squeezes.</p>
<p>&quot;There were some attempts to push the leu lower today, but growing leu shortages prevented bigger dips,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Short-term rates jumped to 150-152 percent from 140 percent in the morning on a cash-starved money market, traders said.</p>
<p>Some traders said the leu might stabilise or even see an upward correction in the next few weeks with help from continued leu shortages.</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar demand is high, but there is also a rush for leu funds. I don't think the greenback will soon have the stomach to breach the 9,000 lei level,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>Operators were keen to see whether the central bank would intervene to prop up the leu in coming days, either by selling dollars or using leu-dollar swaps to supply much-needed leu funds on the market.</p>
<p>Trading livened up after foreign exchange curbs were scrapped on Tuesday, but no significant interbank deals emerged yet, traders said.</p>
<p>Market participants hailed the central bank's (BNR) move to restore local dealer licences to 24 banks, which now act as market makers along with the previous four dealers.</p>
<p>Latest data show zero interbank volume on Tuesday, when overall trading stood at $7.33 million.</p>
<p>Leu-dollar prices at licenced money changing bureaux ranged from 7,940/8,400 to 8,100/8,600.</p>
