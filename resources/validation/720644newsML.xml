<p>Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy on Thursday called for new elections in his war-torn country after the bloody overthrow of Prince Norodom Ranariddh by rival co-premier Hun Sen last weekend.</p>
<p>Rainsy, a former Cambodian finance minister and an ally of Ranariddh's royalist FUNICINPEC party, said forces opposing Hun Sen did not want a civil war but they were ready to fight if the new de facto ruler refused to agree to their demands.</p>
<p>&quot;We want elections to be held as soon as possible and we suggest negotiations between Hun Sen and Prince Ranariddh in order to find a modus vivendi (way of proceeding) and create a caretaker government,&quot; Rainsy told a news conference in Bonn.</p>
<p>&quot;If Hun Sen does not accept this, the democratic forces have to regroup,&quot; he said. He said they were already organising counter-offences from the north and west of the country.</p>
<p>Ranariddh formed a government with Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP) in 1993 after his party narrowly won a United Nations-run general election. The next elections were planned for 1998.</p>
<p>At least 58 people were killed and up to 200 wounded when Hun Sen's troops took control of Phnom Penh in two days of fighting at the weekend. Ranariddh left for France on the eve of the fighting and was due to see U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan later on Thursday.</p>
<p>Rainsy, who heads the officially unrecognised Khmer Nation Party and says he speaks for the National United Front of non-communist parties including Ranariddh's FUNICINPEC, said he would return to Cambodia on Sunday. He had been in France for the last month for his personal safety.</p>
<p>Rainsy welcomed the decision by the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Thursday to postpone Cambodia's membership of the group.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the right decision. How can you admit a country with no legal government. I hope this sends the message to Hun Sen that his coup d'etat is not supported by ASEAN,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also greeted Germany's decision to suspend aid to the country and called on other countries to do the same.</p>
<p>Rainsy said 60 percent of Cambodian state expenditure was financed by international aid and Hun Sen would be forced to back down if donors suspended their aid.</p>
<p>Hun Sen has accused Ranariddh of prompting his own overthrow by open provocation and conducting secret negotiations with Khmer Rouge rebels. But Rainsy said these charges were hypocritical.</p>
<p>&quot;That is just double standards because he has done the same thing himself,&quot; Rainsy said. &quot;It's just a game (fight) over what's left of the Khmer Rouge. Both Ranariddh and Hun Sen have made similar approaches to them.&quot;</p>
