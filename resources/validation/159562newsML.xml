<title>UK: BFI gains again boosted by Panamax demand.</title>
<headline>BFI gains again boosted by Panamax demand.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Reports of significantly higher rates paid for Panamaxes circulated in the freight market on Friday, brokers said.</p>
<p>There was also an impressive volume of fixtures concluded despite the presence of a large part of the shipbroking community in Hamburg and widespread national holidays for All Saints day.</p>
<p>The BFI managed a relatively modest rise of 12 points to 1323 but brokers believe more impressive gains should be seen next week if negotiations attracting speculation today are subsequently confirmed.</p>
<p>Some observers consider that a number of charterers have lately been withholding orders in the hope that the market will lose momentum. But the current situation must now be accepted as unlikely to change in their favour in the short term.</p>
<p>GRAINS -- South Korean charterer Seyang was generally believed to have agreed $24.10 no combo for the Rondeau-relet Banya for 54,000 hss U.S. Gulf/Japan for end Nov.</p>
<p>This compares with $22.40 no combo reported fixed by Hanjin yesterday for similar dates (but not accepted at face value by all brokers). Certainly the Atlantic market looked more than steady on Friday's evidence.</p>
<p>The most modern Panamaxes were achieving in the region of $13,000 daily basis delivery Skaw-Passero trip via U.S. Gulf to the Far East and the 1982-built Olympic Galaxy 64,900 dwt scored an impressive $11,750 daily plus $290,000 bonus delivery U.S. Gulf mid-Nov trip Far East with Hanjin.</p>
<p>Detai of a number of grain fixtures failed to surface - Delphic Pride 64,096 dwt, for example, open Morocco Nov 10/15, Angelic Spirit 65,767 dwt (possibly for Plate/China), and Iolcos Glory 74,841 dwt (possibly delivery Skaw mid Nov trip via Continent to Red Sea or Mid East Gulf at $13,000 daily).</p>
<p>Modern Panamaxes such as Konstantinos, a 71,550 dwt, were understood to be asking at least $14,000 daily delivery Passero for trips east.</p>
<p>Cargill was rumoured to have fixed 50,000 barley from UK to Saudi Arabia and now quotes 33/43,000 barley Rostock-Rouen range including Tilbury for Nov 8/15.</p>
<p>Other new orders included EMC 52-54,000 hss U.S. Gulf/Japan for Dec 1/20, Richardson 20/22,000 wheat NoPac/Guaymas and Topolobampo, and AGD 30,000 meals up river/China for Nov 15/30.</p>
<p>MINERALS--Panamaxes dominated the news. Rumours that as much as $12,500 daily had been paid for a modern vessel for an Australian or NoPac round could not be substantiated but brokers expected yesterday's level of $1,000 daily would be surpassed soon.</p>
<p>Kleimar was again linked with Alessandra d'Amato 69,171 dwt for two laden legs in the Far East at $10,500 daily.</p>
<p>Captain George l 64,000 dwt was understood booked in the same area for 4-6 months at close to $9,500 daily and other older types of Panamax such as Western Trade 65,083 dwt (to PCL for NoPac to Indonesia), Menalon 66,464 dwt and Global Adelaide 72,399 dwt were also understood to have been fixed.</p>
<p>In the coal trades on voyage basis, Sea Union was linked with Yukong for 70,000 tonnes Richards Bay/Algeria possibly at over $7.00 and Cargill covered Maracaibo/Eregli on private terms.</p>
<p>Caper news was limited. A Marshal-class vessel may have fixed 100,000 coal Richards Bay/Continent at about $7.50 and Docenave may have booked Baron Bay 149,000 dwt for two laden legs in the Atlantic at over $11,000 daily.</p>
<p>In the east, Hanjin were said to have fixed La Pampa to cover a Kepco stem of 120,000/5 coal Newcastle/South Korea for mid-Nov at $6.85.</p>
<p>Handy-size rates reported were generally poor in the Far East, South Africa and South America. Even the U.S. Gulf failed to provide any fresh evidence of firmer conditions.</p>
<p>Ld-Seals was believed to have fixed Golden Farmer 37,752 dwt from the Baltic to the Far East at $10,600/10,700 daily and Pan Ocean booked Emerald 46,000 dwt Continent/Far East at $11,600 daily. Elsewhere Pacific Concord took a Cosco-craned bulker NoPac/Far East at $7,300 daily plus $120,000 bonus.</p>
