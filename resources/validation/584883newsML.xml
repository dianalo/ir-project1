<headline>Turkish troops press anti-PKK campaign in Iraq.</headline>
<dateline>ZAKHO, Iraq 1997-05-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Several thousand Turkish troops, backed by tanks and heavy artillery, pushed across the border into northern Iraq early on Wednesday in a move against separatist Kurdish rebel bases.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the assault, which began at 3 a.m. (2300 GMT) followed a security sweep by local Iraqi Kurdish authorities, who ordered all journalists to leave the border region and confiscated mobile telephones capable of reaching Turkey.</p>
<p>&quot;Three thousand troops, including tanks and artillery, started crossing at 2300 GMT and they are still continuing,&quot; a resident close to the border said.</p>
<p>Other witnesses said troops later headed northeast away from Zakho.</p>
<p>A Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman said the operation was a &quot;limited&quot; one, in coordination with local Iraqi Kurds, to oust separatist guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) from the border marshes.</p>
<p>However, a senior security source told Reuters: &quot;This is a wide and comprehensive operation.&quot;</p>
<p>There were no immediate signs of any clashes along the border areas of Iraq, scene in the past of bloody firefights between Turkish security forces and PKK guerrillas.</p>
<p>Turkish army officers inside Iraq were tight-lipped, with one saying only: &quot;We are here on exercises.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some of our troops entered the region...in the region of Zakho,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli told a news briefing in the Turkish capital Ankara.</p>
<p>&quot;(Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud) Barzani began an operation against the PKK this morning, our troops have been going into northern Iraq to support this operation.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Turkish participation against the PKK, at the invitation of Barzani, was &quot;limited&quot; but that troops would take part in clashes as necessary.</p>
<p>Residents on the Turkish side said the border crossing at Habur was closed to all civilian traffic.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a news blackout. No member of the press is permitted access to Zakho,&quot; a local Iraqi Kurdish official said.</p>
<p>Turkish soliders later enforced the news blackout, barring reporters from returning to the area.</p>
<p>Local authorities confiscated the film of a Western photographer who provides pictures to Reuters and other news agencies, before ordering him out of the area.</p>
<p>The Iraqi side of the border is under the general control of Barzani's KDP, a rival of the separatist PKK fighting for independence or autonomy in southeast Turkey.</p>
<p>Last year, Barzani teamed up with the forces of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein against rival Iraqi Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, prompting U.S. missile strikes against Iraqi targets.</p>
<p>Turkish troops regularly cross back and forth in &quot;hot pursuit&quot; of the PKK. In March 1995, tens of thousands of troops pushed deep into Iraq for a prolonged campaign that drove the PKK back but failed to crush them.</p>
<p>A KDP representative in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir said Turkish jets flew bombing missions from a base in the city.</p>
<p>&quot;Turkish planes have been bombing PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) camps in northern Iraq,&quot; Haci Salih Huseyin, Diyarbakir representative of the KDP, told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;They bombed the Zab camp and Hakurk.&quot;</p>
<p>Turkish jets have recently stepped up routine cross-border bombings into northern Iraq, according to reports from the region.</p>
