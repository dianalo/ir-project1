<p>Iran's moderate former culture minister Mohammad Khatami was elected president on Saturday in a stunning upset victory over the Islamic republic's conservative establishment.</p>
<p>His main rival, conservative parliamentary speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, conceded defeat after more than 17 million votes had been counted showing a Khatami landslide.</p>
<p>Tehran radio said he sent a letter of congratulations to Khatami and told him: &quot;I will do my best to cooperate with you.&quot;</p>
<p>Khatami will take over in August from President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who must step down after completing the maximum two four-year terms permitted by law.</p>
<p>The result was a major shock to the religious establishment which has ruled Iran since fundamentalist mullahs toppled the pro-American Shah in 1979.</p>
<p>On partial returns from the 17 million votes counted so far, Khatami won two out of every three votes cast in Friday's nationwide ballot, seen by many as a referendum on 18 years of revolution.</p>
<p>Nateq-Nouri had been widely predicted to take the presidency despite what many Iranian analysts and Western diplomats had forecast would be a close contest.</p>
<p>In the event he was relegated to second place with 28 percent of the vote while two lesser-known other candidates were far behind with relatively insignificant numbers of votes. Both Khatami and Nateq-Nouri are 54-year-old middle-ranking Shi'ite Moslem clergymen.</p>
<p>But Khatami is considered a moderate compared with most of the conservative clerics who run the country. Nateq-Nouri is a traditionalist who enjoys the support of influential groups of conservative mullahs and merchants.</p>
<p>Some 33 million people aged 15 and over were eligible to vote. Interior Ministry officials said turnout was high.</p>
<p>During the 12-day election campaign Khatami attracted a broad coalition of centrists close to Rafsanjani, Islamist left-wingers and women, youths and intellectuals seeking a more relaxed application of Islamic mores.</p>
<p>The coalition was formed to counter conservatives accused by Khatami's supporters of trying to monopolise state power by adding the presidency to their control of the 270-seat parliament, where Nateq-Nouri holds sway.</p>
<p>Khatami, an ayatollah's son, is considered an open-minded religious intellectual and tolerant politician.</p>
<p>He advocates more personal freedom, democracy and the rule of law in a country of 60 million where many complain state bodies act arbitrarily and rules are changed according to the whim of officials.</p>
<p>He also appeals to devout Shi'ites because he holds the title Seyyed and wears a black turban -- signs that he is believed to be descended from Islam's founder the Prophet Mohammad.</p>
<p>The result was a blow to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who outranks the president and tacitly supported Nateq-Nouri.</p>
<p>He urged voters to choose the &quot;best qualified&quot; candidate, someone who could &quot;stand against America and those who want to impose their will on our nation&quot;.</p>
