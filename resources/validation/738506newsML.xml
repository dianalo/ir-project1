<headline>Euro oil swaps react differently to crude drop.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>European oil swaps showed wildly mixed reactions to screen crude's correction of Thursday's mini-rally.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs were several cents firmer while gasoline tumbled heavily, losing $6/7 on the front month. Naphtha softened $1 close in, but was firmer further out while fuel held broadly steady.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs for July 21-25 firmed to +11 cents against September Brent from +3/4 cents and July 28-August 1 was stronger at -3 cents from -7 cents. August 4-8 rose to -2 cents against September from -10 cents and August 11-15 firmed 3 cents or so to -10 cents.</p>
<p>Gasoline swaps were hit hard in light of the product's recent primary role as driver for the whole energy complex.</p>
<p>&quot;Gasoline gave and gasoline took-away,&quot;  said one trader.</p>
<p>Wet barges trades in the morning at $191, $193 and $193.50 were unobtainable in the afternoon and the swaps market reflected this reversal.</p>
<p>August was talked at $186.75 from $193.25 while September eased back to $185.50 from $191. There was unconfirmed talk that September traded at $189.00 and July at $193.50.</p>
<p>Fuel swaps which edged up on the gains slipped again with July holding around $88-88.50 on high sulphur with August at $89.00.</p>
<p>Further out Q4 traded at $94 and Q198 at $97.00 and $98.00.</p>
<p>Low sulphur traded a couple of times at $100.50 and subsequently offered at $101.</p>
