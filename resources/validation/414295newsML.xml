<p>Irish President Mary Robinson voiced deep concern on Monday over judicial standards in Rwanda where 90,000 genocide-related prisoners languish in jails and there are few lawyers to defend them.</p>
<p>On her third visit to the Central African country, Robinson told reporters she would take up the matter with Rwanda's justice minister and other officials.</p>
<p>The Irish president later visited a prison at Gikondo outside Kigali, where she met some 500 youthful prisoners.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be expressing concerns about the fact that there are now over 90,000 prisoners and although the process of bringing cases to court has started, there are concerns about the standard of the due process of the law,&quot; Robsinson said.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the biggest problems is the shortage of defence lawyers,&quot; Robinson added. She said there were a number of international groups helping with the lawyer question.</p>
<p>Most of the prisoners are detained on suspicion of involvement in Rwanda's 1994 genocide when supporters of the former Hutu government butchered about 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</p>
<p>The first trials began last December and so far 12 defendants have been sentenced to death. No executions have been carried out yet.</p>
<p>At Gikondo prison, Robinson expressed hope that the inmates would have their cases expedited and minor suspects could be separated from the hardcore group.</p>
<p>&quot;It is my major hope that the authorities will be able to separate the cases very soon,&quot; Robinson told the inmates as Rwandan officials looked on.</p>
<p>Officials said the separation of prisoners into different cases came up during talks with military strongman and vice-president, Major-General Paul Kagame.</p>
<p>Ireland has no special relationship with Rwanda, but the fact that Robinson has been tipped to be a possible new U.N. high commissioner for human rights might enable her to bring pressure to bear on Rwandan officials.</p>
<p>Robinson praised U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for action on problems at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda &quot;very forcefully and effectively&quot; so the tribunal could perform its part in &quot;breaking a circle of impunity&quot;.</p>
<p>Annan sacked Tribunal Registrar Andronico Adede of Kenya and Deputy Prosecutor Honore Rakotomanana of Madagascar after an internal report that spoke of abuses and mismanagement.</p>
<p>The tribunal is based in Arusha, Tanzania. Its progress in arresting and trying defendants has been painfully slow.</p>
<p>Robinson said establishing domestic courts was a challenge and the Irish government had supported the effort of the Rwandan government to train judges and establish courts.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Robinson had dinner with President Pasteur Bizimungu after meeting Kagame. On Monday, she was due to meet diplomats, human rights monitors and U.N. humanitarian officials.</p>
