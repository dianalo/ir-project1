<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel on Saturday declined comment on a report that he would demand higher taxes or a delay in a planned tax cut at a meeting of top officials in the ruling coalition.</p>
<p>The Bild am Sonntag weekly newspaper, citing information from the Finance Ministry, reported Waigel expected a shortfall of between 20 and 25 billion marks ($14.7 billion) in next year's budget and would need extra income from taxes to fill the gap.</p>
<p>The paper, in an advance release from Sunday's edition, said Waigel would tell a Sunday night coalition meeting chaired by Chancellor Helmut Kohl that he wanted either to raise fuel tax or postpone a planned two-point cut in an income tax surcharge.</p>
<p>Waigel declined to comment on the report when questioned by reporters accompanying him on a cycling tour of southern Germany.</p>
<p>Kohl's junior coalition partners, the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), have repeatedly said they will not approve tax rises to fill buget gaps and are also determined to push through the cut in the &quot;solidarity surcharge&quot; on income tax.</p>
<p>The surcharge was imposed to help pay for the cost of German unification. It is due to be cut by two percentage points at the beginning of next year. ($ = 1.705 German Marks)</p>
