<p>The recovery in the Australian building industry would continue for another two years before easing back over the longer term, forecasting group BIS Shrapnel Pty Ltd said in a report on Monday.</p>
<p>BIS forecast a 10 percent rise in building commencements in 1997/98 (July-June) and a 0.4 percent increase in 1998/99 after seven percent growth in 1996/97.</p>
<p>The report, which considers building trends to 2012, forecast that average annual total building starts over the five years to 2001/02 would be six per cent higher than the average for the five years to 1997.  </p>
<p>Non-residential building and construction starts were forecast to rise 11 percent in 1997/98, taking activity to its highest level for almost 10 years.</p>
<p>However, BIS expected to the market to fall 10 percent in 1998/99 through a A$500 million decline in entertainment and recreational building projects.</p>
<p>Over the next five years, the report said the average annual level of new residential activity would remain stable, before declining six percent over the five years to 2007.  </p>
<p>Residential alterations and additions would be the buoyant sector over the next 15 years with annual compound growth of 2.4 percent, it said.</p>
