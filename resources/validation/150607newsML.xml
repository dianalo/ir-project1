<p>U.S. Treasuries closed sharply higher on Tuesday as investors cheered a new batch of economic data that suggested inflation pressures remain mostly in check, analysts said.</p>
<p>The 6-3/4 percent 30-year benchmark Treasury bond ended up two full points 100-28/32. Its yield, which spent the last two weeks trapped in a range between 6.80 and 6.86 percent, fell to 6.68 percent, the lowest level since the April 4 close.</p>
<p>Prices rallied across the yield curve, with buyers ranging from retailers to speculators to some longer-term investors.  </p>
<p>The rally was trigerred by the release of a lower-than-expected rise in the Employment Cost Index (ECI) for the third quarter. The gauge rose 0.6 percent against an expected 0.8 percent increase.</p>
<p>&quot;The ECI sparked the rally,&quot; said Lee Youngdahl, economist and vice-president at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very impressive number in terms of showing no accelaration in wage pressures, which had been the fear ... That made everybody feel better about the inflation outlook and the risks of holding fixed-income securities,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>A drop in consumer confidence as measured by The Conference Board also provided underpinning. The index dropped to 106.2 in October against a revised 111.8 in September.</p>
<p>&quot;The market embraced the ECI figure and that was reinforced by the slight pullback in consumer confidence,&quot; said Kevin Flanagan, first vice-president and economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</p>
<p>Analysts said the new data bolstered a view in the market that holds the economy is continuing to slow with no sign of inflation on the horizon.  </p>
<p>&quot;It was almost as if the market was waiting to move higher. It just needed some information or some confirmation and it got it,&quot; Dean Witter's Flanagan said.</p>
<p>Analysts also said the data hinted the Federal Reserve might keep monetary policy on hold at the next meeting of its policy-setting body on November 13.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fed was mostly out of the picture in November already ... but I also think the odds of a tightening in December are fading rather rapidly,&quot; Aubrey's Youngdahl said.</p>
<p>The Fed has kept its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 5-1/4 percent since January 31.  </p>
<p>The technical outlook for the market also improved substantially. Analysts said the market looked attractive after it broke out of a triangle pattern in which it had been trapped for the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>If the market consolidates its gains at current levels, analysts said the next target for the benchmark bond is 6.50 percent.</p>
<p>Despite the optimism, some experts dropped a word of caution ahead of an upcoming slew of fresh data to be released later this week.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market is acting great and it's bullish and happy, but you are still going to have payrolls to be careful about,&quot; said Michael Krauss, managing director and chief technical strategist at Chase Securities Inc.</p>
<p>The government will release its October employment report on Friday at 0830 EST/1330 GMT. In a Reuters survey, Wall Street economists see non-farm payrolls rising 212,000 in October against a 40,000 drop the previous month.  </p>
<p>The three-month Treasury bill rate closed down three basis points at 5.01 percent. The six-month bill rate fell seven points to 5.08 percent. The year bill rate was down 10 points points at 5.16 percent.</p>
<p>The two-year note closed up 10/32 at 100-7/32, yielding 5.76 percent. The five-year note traded up 24/32 at 100-19/32 to yield 6.11 percent. The ten-year note closed up 1-8/32 at 100-26/32, yielding 6.39 percent.</p>
