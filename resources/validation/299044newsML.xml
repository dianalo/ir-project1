<p>Mexican stocks rebounded from their earlier slump to approach resistance at record levels in mid-afternoon trade on Friday, after foreign buyers stepped into the market.</p>
<p>&quot;It's crazy down here. Foreign buyers broke loose in a big way.  I think they want to snap up positions at good prices ahead of the weekend,&quot; a floor trader said.  The leading IPC share index was up 19.50 points, or 0.55 percent, at 3597.84.</p>
<p>&quot;We're heading for resistance at 3,600 points and we may take a break there,&quot; the trader added.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones meanwhile soared 1.18 percent to a new record close of 6,703.79 points.</p>
<p>Traders said the bourse slumped in early trade on fallout from an initial surge in yields on U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds to 6.90 percent, but recovered in tandem with the Dow as long bond yields receded to 6.85 percent in late trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreigners have stepped in to buy short-term positions, which has fueled the IPC rally. This implies they may see further gains in coming sessions,&quot; said Hector Jimenez, an analyst with the Inverlat financial group.  </p>
<p>&quot;Nonetheless, the bourse did not manage to climb above resistance at 3,600 points, which implies it is trying to consolidate with light profit-taking to bolster a renewed advance,&quot; Jimenez added.</p>
<p>Another analyst said investors were buying on an improved outlook for economic growth ahead of potential political stumbling blocks.</p>
<p>&quot;Mexico looks good this year. I feel dealers are picking up paper that is still well priced before jitters intrude half-way through the year with (mid-term) elections,&quot; an equity analyst said.  </p>
<p>On the broad market, a total of 119 stocks were traded, with gains outnumbering losses by 55 to 39.</p>
<p>Financial stock Serfin was a notable gainer, up 30 centavos to 3.43 pesos, which traders said benefitted from technical buy signals.</p>
<p>Debt-ridden holding group Sidek headed the falls, down 10 centavos to 80 centavos.</p>
