<p>Hong Kong stocks are expected to search for support this week after a battering late last week on renewed fears of rising interest rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index tumbled 169.19 points or 1.49 percent on Friday, falling through support at around 11,200 points to end at 11,159.02. Over the week it shed 266 points, or 2.32 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the index will still be looking for a bottom,&quot; said Boby Ho, dealing manager at GK Goh Securities. He added that 11,000 was an important support level.</p>
<p>Analysts said Hong Kong stocks were likely to follow the direction of U.S. stocks and bonds next week. Monday is the Labor Day holiday in the United States.</p>
<p>Stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data last week revived fears of higher interest rates, pushing the long bond yield back above the psychological 7.0 percent level.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they (Hong Kong stocks) may come down a bit more depending on Wall Street and economic statistics,&quot; said Howard Gorges, director at South China Brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the downside is 11,000 to 11,100 ... it may not be as low as that but you can't rule it out. The upside is probably around 11,400 or 11,500. It will tend to be at the lower half of the range rather than the higher half.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. August jobs report is due out on Friday and will be watched closely by the market, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;That is what we have got to watch out for -- U.S. statistics (and) Wall Street's reaction,&quot; said Gorges.</p>
<p>Ricky Tam, senior research analyst at Delta Asia Securities, said U.S. stocks could face further selling pressure on Tuesday when investors return from the Labor Day holiday, prompting weakness in the local market at the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>Friday's fall below 11,250 points on the Hang Seng index may signal another downtrend is on the way, he added. &quot;The market may resume a downward trend to test 11,000 again.&quot;</p>
<p>But Tam said prices could rebound later in the week.</p>
<p>&quot;I think recently the market drop has been due to a bit of overselling so I think if markets are stable overseas in the week ahead, then Hong Kong could move higher,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index rose 477.60 points, or 4.47 percent, for the whole of August.</p>
