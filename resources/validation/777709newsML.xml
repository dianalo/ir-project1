<p>Belgian shares extended losses on Tuesday as European bond and equity markets headed south on fears the Bundesbank may raise rates to stem the mark's decline.</p>
<p>&quot;If (the Bundesbank) doesn't do anything the market will go up again,&quot; one trader said. &quot;(But) If they raise rates who cares about support levels.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bel-20 index ended down 0.59 percent at 2,455.72 points, but off its low of the day hit during a wave of selling of Bel-20 component shares around noon.</p>
<p>One trader said there was support for the market around 2,450 points. Another put support at 2,400 points.</p>
<p>He added, however, the Bel-20 had already crashed through the 2,500 level fairly effortlessly and in the present climate anything could happen.</p>
<p>He noted that Germany's Ifo institute had warned on Tuesday the Bundesbank might act if the dollar broke above 1.90 marks. By midday in New York, the dollar had climbed above its European close to around 1. 8825.</p>
<p>He added, &quot;I don't know if the Bundesbank has space to do something with Germany's high unemployment and low level of economic activity.&quot;</p>
<p>German July jobless data is due at 0755 GMT on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Steels and selected small caps were a notable exception to Tuesday's trend.</p>
<p>Shares in Luxembourg-based Arbed rose 8.93 percent to 4,880 francs on a raft of broker upgrades following last week's announcement it would buy a minority interest in Spain's CSI.</p>
<p>Belgian Cockerill Sambre also rebounded three francs to 160 francs, near its July 29, 168-franc high reached on the back of a bullish EC report on the steel industry.</p>
<p>However, after the close, a United Nations agency issued a warning the industry was still faced with an output glut.</p>
<p>Among small caps, photo processing group Spector rose 2.83 percent to 2,725 francs, while recently listed shoe retailer Brantano bounced back 2.12 percent to 1,058 francs after hitting on Monday its lowest level since being introduced to the bourse.</p>
<p>The main Bel-20 loser was oil group PetroFina, whose shares lost 3.33 percent to 14,525 francs -- below the level they were last week ahead of well received first half 1997 earnings news. PetroFina shares also lagged other oil groups, buoyed by better-than-expected first half figures from BP and ahead of Royal Dutch/Shell results later this week.</p>
