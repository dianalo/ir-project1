<p>Staples Inc and Office Depot Inc are soon expected to terminate their planned $4.6 billion merger after the latest blow to hit the nearly 10-month-old transaction.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts and traders said the two companies are unlikely to appeal a judge's decision that granted a preliminary injunction to the deal.</p>
<p>&quot;The deal is dead. The companies will go their own ways and pursue their own strategies,&quot; said Mark Mandel of The Chicago Corp.  </p>
<p>Late Monday U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan agreed to block the deal between the two office-products superstore chains. The Federal Trade Commission had vehemently opposed their merger, contending it would raise prices.</p>
<p>For their part, Office Depot and Staples argued the company to be created by the combination would have less than a six percent market share in the fragmented $185 billion industry.</p>
<p>Wall Street traders who invested in the companies after the deal was struck have been watching developments closely.  </p>
<p>Originally worth $4 billion, the proposed stock transaction has risen in value to about $4.6 billion, reflecting stock price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Market sources said Office Depot's stock price, which closed Monday at 19-7/16, tumbled to about 14-1/2 in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of guys who are going to be carried out on stretchers. There was an enormous reward in this deal, but there also was enormous risk,&quot; said one trader who did not want to be identified.  </p>
<p>The two companies declined to comment on their immediate plans, saying only that they expected to make a decision within a few days.</p>
<p>But Office Depot made it clear that it was ready to proceed with its regular course of business, saying it intended to start filling open positions. The company also said the merger process has helped it focus on its business.</p>
<p>&quot;The odds of the deal being revived are under five percent. I can't think of anything in the (judge's) decision that would make the parties want to go forward from here,&quot; said another trader who did not want to be identified.  </p>
<p>Staples, the top player in the industry, is well positioned to compete without Office Depot, Mandel said.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, Staples is in the driver's seat in the industry. They had the least to lose if the deal fell apart,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, &quot;Office Depot has to rally its troops and get the fire back in its belly,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The two companies announced the proposed transaction in early September. The Federal Trade Commission rejected the deal twice, including one time after the companies restructured their arrangement by agreeing to sell 60 stores to rival OfficeMax Inc.  </p>
<p>Several states joined with the commission in opposing the deal. Sharesholders of both companies approved the transaction earlier this month.</p>
