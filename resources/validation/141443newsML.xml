<p>Interest rate cuts have knocked some wind out of the sails of the buoyant Swedish crown and Italian lira, but technical analysts said the corrections were mere hiccups on the high-yielders' bullish longer-term charts.</p>
<p>The lira began Wednesday at 999.60 but lurched lower after the Bank of Italy sprang a discount rate cut late in the day on an unsuspecting market. It set a low of 1007.80 per mark today.</p>
<p>Sweden's crown swung down to 4.3350 to the mark from late yesterday's 4.3140/70 after the Riksbank eased rates too.</p>
<p>Karen Jones, technical analyst at Credit Suisse here, said the mark's stab through 4.33 crowns completed a small base stretching from 4.33 to 4.29. That confirmed a short-term correction and set up a measured target of 4.37.</p>
<p>&quot;A move to 4.37 barely impacts on what can only be described as an amazingly bearish chart,&quot; said Jones.</p>
<p>The mark has depreciated by 5.1 percent against the Swedish crown in the last two months and by 4.7 percent versus the Italian lira over the same period.</p>
<p>Chart watchers said the mark was now gearing up to demolish trendline resistance around 1007 lire and attack 1013.</p>
<p>&quot;The only resistance on the top short-term is from long positions, but we think the cross is on the way to touch 1013.50,&quot; said Paoli Mengoli, technical analyst at UBS in Lugano.</p>
<p>That area represents a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the mark's decline from the July 31 high of 1036.70 lire to the 988.40 low hit on October 7, analysts said.</p>
<p>The next Fibonacci objective beyond there is around 1020, the 61.8 percent retracement level of that downmove. Mark/lira stood at 1005.35/65 at 1120 GMT.</p>
<p>Alan Dunne, technical analyst at BankAmerica in London, said mark/lira's break of 1002.50 had drawn an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the charts.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as it holds above 1002 now, potential to 1015 exists,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse's Jones saw the mark failing initially in the 1007/1008 region before rallying to around 1013/15. &quot;The reason I think that because mark/stocky is so bid, and mark/stocky usually leads the rest (of the crosses),&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Analysts noted that 38.2 percent of the mark's slide from the 4.4955 Swedish crown peak of August 29 to the October 14 low of 4.2870 cut in around 4.3670.</p>
<p>A breach there would open 4.37 ahead of the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level near 4.3910, they said. The mark was quoted at 4.3220/50 at today's midsession. But on a bigger scale, chartists said moves such as a lira fall to 1013 or a Swedish crown decline to 4.37 were nothing to write home about.</p>
<p>&quot;I must say in the scheme of things this will make zero impact on the bear trend -- (mark/lira) has moved down for a very long time so 50 percent is the minimum retracement, really,&quot; said Jones.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless it does something completely out of the ordinary, I'll stay with the view that they are correcting only.&quot;</p>
