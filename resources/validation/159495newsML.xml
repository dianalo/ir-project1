<title>NETHERLANDS: DUTCH CLOSING SHARE MARKET REPORT.</title>
<headline>DUTCH CLOSING SHARE MARKET REPORT.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-11-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch shares ended the week up, the AEX index of blue chips gaining 4.29 at 581.31.</p>
<p>Entertainment company Endemol, which started trading in the afternoon was the main focus, distracting some attention from the release of fairly supportive U.S. payrolls data.</p>
<p>&quot;It was on fire,&quot; one trader said. &quot;Retail clients who only received a small number of shares sold them, while the institutionals were big buyers,&quot; he added. The issue was oversubscribed 25 times.</p>
<p>Royal Dutch continued to weigh on the index, losing another 3.50 guilders, after yesterday's third quarter results.  </p>
<p>Paper and packaging maker KNP BT, up 0.30 guilders at 37.70, made up half of yesterday's losses, but analysts still doubt whether paper prices will recover soon.</p>
<p>De Boer Winkelbedrijven, to merge with unlisted Unigro, was among the losers today, falling 3.80 guilders (3.08%) to close at 119.70. It had gained 29.20 since the merger announcement.</p>
<p>Paper &amp; Printing company Roto Smeets de Boer figured also among the losers, down 3.19 percent at 69.70 guilders. &quot;That might very well have nothing to do with KNP BT, but be due to a confusion yesterday between these shares and De Boer's&quot; a dealer suggested. Roto reached a year high yesterday at 75 guilders. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040</p>
