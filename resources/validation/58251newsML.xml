<title>ARGENTINA: Graves desecrated on Jewish New Year in Argentina.</title>
<headline>Graves desecrated on Jewish New Year in Argentina.</headline>

<p>Fifty-six graves were desecrated at a Jewish cemetery in central Argentina during the Jewish New Year, police said on Monday.</p>
<p>Tombstones were removed and destroyed and bronze plates stolen from the Jewish cemetery in Cordoba, Argentina's second largest city.</p>
<p>Local rabbi Gabriel Fryman demanded &quot;a deep investigation in order to find the authors of this reprehensible desecration&quot; perpetrated over the weekend, when Jews were marking their New Year, the local DyN news agency reported.</p>
<p>He said there were occasional desecrations, but they were not common.</p>
<p>Argentina is home to one of the world's largest Jewish communities and has been a safe haven for notorious Nazi war criminals, including Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann and SS Captain Erich Priebke.</p>
<p>Eichmann was abducted by Israeli commandos in 1960 and taken to Israel where he was tried and executed. Priebke was recently extradited to Rome to face trial for Italy's worst Second World War crime -- the Ardeatine Caves massacre.</p>
<p>Former Argentine Justice Minister Adolfo Barra resigned in July after a magazine reported his teenage membership in a youth wing of a neo-Nazi group that carried out attacks, including the killing of a Jewish lawyer.</p>
