<p>A double bogey six at the notorious 17th hole cost Mark O'Meara a record for the Old Course at St Andrews on the first day of the Alfred Dunhill Cup team event on Thursday.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old American finished with a nine-under-par 63, one shot outside the 62 of compatriot Curtis Strange from the same event in 1987.</p>
<p>O'Meara birdied every hole from the second to the ninth -- tying the record for successive birdies -- and collected two more at the 11th and 12th to reach 10 under par for his round.</p>
<p>But after four more pars, his second shot at the 461-yard &quot;Road Hole&quot; 17th rolled across the green and down a slope onto the road behind.</p>
<p>He used his putter from the road but the ball only reached the top of the slope. His next putt rolled five feet past the pin and he missed from there.</p>
<p>O'Meara then birdied the last -- his 11th birdie of the round -- to complete his 63.  </p>
<p>O'Meara, whose 28 for the front nine was a record for the Old Course, credited his score to great putting as he beat Costantino Rocca of Italy by seven shots.</p>
<p>His birdie putts on the front nine were from eight, eight, 40, 12, 14, 20, 20 and 45 feet. Then he holed from eight and 10 feet at the 11th and 12th.</p>
<p>&quot;But I've actually had better putting days than that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm pleased with the round but I understand I had a reasonable chance to tie or break the record, so that's a little disappointing.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe I was a bit unlucky at the 17th. The ball might have stayed up (on the green). But the 17th hole has got me quite a few times before.&quot;</p>
