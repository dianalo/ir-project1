<p>French Justice Minister Jacques Toubon met exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Tuesday despite a warning by China against such meetings.</p>
<p>But France said Toubon met the Dalai Lama, who is on a two-day private visit to the French capital, as a private individual rather than as a government representative.</p>
<p>&quot;Jacques Toubon visited the Dalai Lama this morning. It was a strictly private meeting to show the respect owed a great spiritual leader and Nobel Prize winner,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Officials stressed that Toubon is also mayor of Paris's 13th district which contains a large southeast Asian population, most of whom are Buddhist.</p>
<p>&quot;France respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China with whom it intends to develop an extensive partnership in economic, political and cultural areas,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rummelhardt also voiced France's wish to see &quot;a constructive dialogue established between China and the Dalai Lama&quot;.</p>
<p>China earlier warned French authorities against meetings with the Dalai Lama, saying they would have an impact on relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama earlier accused China of committing &quot;cultural genocide&quot; in Tibet.</p>
<p>&quot;A kind of cultural genocide is taking place in Tibet&quot; he told the French daily Le Monde. &quot;Losing one's independence is acceptable, but losing one's culture, accepting the destruction of our spiritualism, of Tibetan Buddhism, is unthinkable.&quot;</p>
<p>The 1989 Nobel Peace laureate is on a European tour that last week brought a Chinese protest to the European Union over a meeting he had had with officials of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Rummelhardt said the Dalai Lama was in Paris to deliver a lecture on Buddhism and for medical tests, but he did not indicate what type of tests.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama is also scheduled to meet French parliamentarians, Socialist opposition leader Lionel Jospin and Paris mayor Jean Tiberi.</p>
