<p>The Italian government might be trapped into putting the lira back into the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) at too high a level with disastrous results for the economy, the employers' federation warned on Friday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi has said he wants to return the lira to the ERM fold by the end of the year and last week called for immediate talks with European partners to fix a level for the long-awaited re-entry.</p>
<p>But Giorgio Fossa, the president of Italian employers' organisation Confindustria, told reporters that the lira had risen too strongly in recent weeks and demanded caution at a time when the economy was stagnating.</p>
<p>&quot;The government risks falling into a trap,&quot; he said. &quot;Perhaps...even other countries are pushing the lira to levels which are favourable (for them).&quot;</p>
<p>The traditionally volatile lira plummeted out of the ERM in 1992 and lost substantial ground against a basket of European currencies in the subsequent fall-out.</p>
<p>However it has regained strength over the past year, boosted by increased political stability and a growing belief that Italy might yet whip its economy into shape for the planned launch of the single European currency in 1999.</p>
<p>The gains have alarmed industrialists who engineered an export boom in 1994 and 1995 on the back of the weak lira, but have seen their competitive edge eroded by the recent advances.</p>
<p>Fossa said he thought that the central ERM parity rate for the lira should be somewhere between 1,000 to 1,100 against the German mark.</p>
<p>&quot;It should certainly not go back in at 950. Italy is already in difficulty and that level would bring it to its knees,&quot; he added. The lira has recently slipped into a range just below the 1,000 level against the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;The lira is now certainly over-valued,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees.</p>
<p>Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio said on Thursday he thought the lira was &quot;not especially out of kilter&quot; at the moment, while the French government argues that the Italian currency should appreciate further.</p>
<p>The lira lost around 40 percent of its value against the French Franc after being ejected from the ERM and has since regained only some 20 percent of this lost ground.</p>
<p>Neither the French nor Italian industrialists are likely to be entirely satisfied when the central parity rate is fixed.</p>
<p>&quot;It is going to be very tough for industrialists to get the level they want to see. Already 1,010 (against the mark) would be the weakest possible re-entry level we can think of,&quot; said Lorenzo Stanca, head of research at bank Credito Italiano.</p>
<p>But the Italian government will also fight to prevent the lira firming much further, anxious to prevent entering the ERM at too optimistic a level and being forced out of the grid for a second time in any future currency turmoil.</p>
<p>Prodi wants to peg the lira back into the ERM by the end of December. Some traders believe the issue might be decided as soon as next Monday, when the EU's monetary committee is due to meet in Brussels.</p>
<p>However EU officials say the return will probably be settled later in the year given the diversity of opinion over what the appropriate entry rate should be.</p>
