<p>Taleban forces backed by armour occupied the strategic Bagram highway junction north of Kabul on Wednesday and immediately drew a barrage of rocket fire from retreating troops of the ousted Kabul government, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Five people were killed and another 10 were wounded in fighting around the Bagram military airfield, hospital staff in Charikar said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Taleban are in the junction and we are firing rockets at them from several positions,&quot; Mirabbudin Astana, an assistant to Ahmad Shah Masood, military chief of the ousted government, confirmed in Jabal os-Siraj late in the day.</p>
<p>Reporters who had been to the junction about 60 km (40 miles) from Kabul with troops of the ousted government on Wednesday morning were advised not to proceed further than Charikar, 15 km (nine miles) north, when they tried to return in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Trucks carrying heavily armed troops loyal to Masood were seen speeding south towards Bagram junction along with several of his tanks in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>Charikar, which had been bustling in the morning, was a ghost-town by then with virtually every shop shuttered and a large exodus of civilians in overcrowded vehicles and by foot.</p>
<p>Some were fleeing Bagram and spots south where fighting had broken out on Wednesday. Others were leaving Charikar in anticipation of fighting breaking out there.</p>
<p>The expected push south towards Kabul from the Bagram junction by Masood's forces has so far failed to materialise and instead those troops have found themselves surprised by a Taleban advance north.</p>
<p>Vital military support from Uzbek General Abdul Rashid Dostum has not arrived, leaving unanswered the question whether he and Masood are close to a deal to cooperate in driving Taleban forces out of Kabul or not.</p>
<p>A senior adviser to Masood told Reuters: &quot;Troops will not be coming from the north today&quot; but refused to elaborate.</p>
<p>His phrasing left reporters guessing whether Dostum had promised help which had falied to show up or whether the forces were expected on Thursday.</p>
<p>The result was a crazy patchwork of fighting between Masood's men and Taleban troops north of Kabul.</p>
<p>Unidentified warplanes, presumably Taleban, bombed strategically important Jabal os-Siraj for a second successive day on Wednesday, narrowly missing a command post from which Masood sometimes operates, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The sound of jets approaching triggered frantic anti-aircraft fire as truck-mounted guns around the area attempted to bring the attackers down. One bomb landed harmlessly in a field near Masood's command post and another damaged a house in the area.</p>
<p>Jabal os-Siraj sits 90 km (60 miles) north of Kabul astride the main highway linking the capital to northern Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Ten km south at Charikar planes also overflew in the morning, drawing anti-aircraft fire and the imprecations of local residents who had been bombed the two days previous.</p>
<p>&quot;We had nine persons killed and six wounded here on Monday from these bombs and they came again yesterday,&quot; said an elderly resident as the sound of jet engines screamed in the distance.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the fault of Pakistan. They support the Taleban who are trying to enslave us.&quot;</p>
<p>The conservative Islamic Taleban force has gained momentum swiftly in Afghanistan over the past two years and took Kabul in late September to the surprise of virtually everyone, including government forces who staged an orderly retreat.</p>
<p>Since then Masood has regrouped, mended fences with some former foes, including Dostum, and begun moving back into position to try to recapture the capital.</p>
<p>Masood's office issued an ultimatum to the Taleban on Wednesday, essentially warning them to withdraw from Kabul or face the consequences.</p>
<p>While aircraft bombing runs triggered fear among the local population on Wednesday, the fighting that really mattered north of Kabul was occurring on the ground. The picture was far from clear.</p>
<p>Reporters could hear heavy artillery and multiple-barreled rocket launchers firing in the distance from both Charikar and Jabal os-Siraj during the day.</p>
<p>There has been fighting between Masood's troops and the Taleban at the  military airfield at Bagram for the better part of a week. A man wounded in fighting around the airfield on Wednesday told reporters neither side had clear control of the area.</p>
