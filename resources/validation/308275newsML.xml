<p>Troops patrolled Niger's capital on Wednesday after the arrest of former president Mahamane Ousmane and two other opposition leaders following a turbulent weekend protest, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Mahamane, former parliamentary speaker Mahamadou Issoufou and Tandja Mamadou, leader of the former single party, the National Movement for a Development Society (MNSD), had been transferred to unknown destinations, witnesses added.</p>
<p>The three, under house arrest since Saturday's protests, are part of an eight-party opposition alliance which accuses President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of rigging July presidential elections to legitimise his rule after a January 1996 coup.</p>
<p>Mainassara's supporters won a majority in November parliamentary elections in the West African nation.</p>
<p>The opposition staged Saturday's demonstration in defiance of a ban to demand greater access to state media but the authorities, accusing protesters of being armed and seeking to destabilise the state, broke up the protest with tear gas.</p>
<p>Officials reported 26 injuries and about 60 arrests.</p>
<p>Judicial sources said the three opposition leaders could appear before a state security court set up on Tuesday by Mainassara. They can be held for up to a month without trial.</p>
<p>Mainassara toppled Mahamane in January 1996, saying he wanted to end lingering political deadlock paralysing government of the impoverished nation. Mahamane was in dispute with his prime minister Hama Amadou, who was from a rival party.</p>
<p>Western donors denounced the coup, urging early elections.</p>
