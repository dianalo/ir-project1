<p>A white custom hearse, a solid bronze casket with a price tag of $13,000 and an extra-roomy coffin for the king-size corpse were on display at a convention of funeral directors this week.</p>
<p>The 5,000 attending also heard pitches from air cargo companies, interior designers, software firms and tailors.</p>
<p>At their convention, funeral directors shed the somber faces they normally wear at the office. After business sessions, they partied, they danced, they shopped.</p>
<p>&quot;You live with seriousness all the time,&quot; said Dan Becker of Struthers, Ohio. &quot;When you have the opportunity, you have to have the ability to laugh.&quot;</p>
<p>Far from morbid, most funeral directors are warm, gregarious and caring, they said.</p>
<p>Although funerals are a $15-billion-a-year industry in the United States, most funeral homes are &quot;mom and pop&quot; family businesses, often in their fourth, fifth or even sixth generation.</p>
<p>The biggest funeral companies are Houston-based Service Corp. International with 2,864 facilities and Loewen Group, Inc., based in Vancouver, with 926.</p>
<p>But independent funeral homes account for about 85 percent of the business, according to the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA), the trade group hosting the convention.</p>
<p>Funeral directors must be counselors who provide support to families at a frightening and vulnerable time.</p>
<p>They handle logistics. Goliath Casket, Inc. of Lynn, Ind., displayed a doublewide unit for the unusually overweight.</p>
<p>Funeral directors encounter feuding siblings who disagree about every detail. They deal with parents of murdered children, with homosexual partners previously unknown to grieving parents, with small children who ask hard questions.</p>
<p>Sometimes the &quot;other woman&quot; in a love triangle appears.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to try to give support and consideration to all sides,&quot; said Walter Lindsey III, who owns two funeral homes, in Willard and Attica, Ohio. &quot;You can't be judgmental.&quot;</p>
<p>Increasingly, women are funeral directors. About 30 percent of the students at 11 mortuary science schools across the country are women, the association said.</p>
<p>Teresa Basinger said she decided on her career at age 13.</p>
<p>&quot;When my grandparents died, I had a lot of questions,&quot; she said. &quot;I found, at the funeral home, people who could help answer my questions.&quot;</p>
<p>Now she owns the Pettet Funeral Home in Murphysboro, Ill. &quot;There's a growing opportunity for women. I recommend it as a business, and I get a great deal of satisfaction from helping people at times when they need a lot of help,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Consumer watchdogs groups have estimated the average U.S. funeral costs $4,456. Price depends on many variables including the cost of the casket, which averages $197 for reinforced fiberboard and $3,735 for copper, NFDA said.</p>
<p>The solid bronze Promethean, made by Hillenbrand Industries, Inc.'s Batesville Casket Co., retails for more than the $13,000 it costs the funeral director.</p>
