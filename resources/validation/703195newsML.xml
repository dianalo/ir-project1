<title>SPAIN: Madrid stocks gain to another record at close.</title>
<headline>Madrid stocks gain to another record at close.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-07-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Madrid stocks continued their record run on Wednesday, ending at fresh closing highs which dealers said was more a reflection of the fact that there were few sellers rather than any new incentives to buy.</p>
<p>The general index rose 9.78 points, 1.61 percent, to 618.36 and the Ibex added 125.03 points, 1.79 percent, to 7,094.94.</p>
<p>Gains were concentrated in Repsol, Telefonica, pushing up after a period of underperformance in heavy trade. Telefonica broke key resistance at 4,415 pesetas to end up 125 pesetas to 4,440.</p>
<p>Participants said a correction was due, with the Ibex now more expensive than some core markets. However they could not see when this might emerge, with investment fund flows into the market continuing to push up prices beyond fair values.</p>
<p>&quot;This is madness. There haven't been any sellers all day so prices have had to rocket. It's going to take a shock news item to bring the market down, and when it does it'll come down hard,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign brokerage in Madrid.</p>
<p>Some talked of a possible new rate cut at Thursday's Bank of Spain repo auction. But most dismissed the idea.</p>
<p>All ten analysts polled by Reuters today agreed the central bank will hold its key money rate at 5.25 percent on Thursday.</p>
