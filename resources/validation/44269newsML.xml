<p>Excerpts from &quot;Core Politics on Track Despite Chaotic Party Politics,&quot; a political update on India by Caspian Securities explores the progress of the United Front, India's ruling coalition.</p>
<p>								 -----oOo-----</p>
<p>CORE POLICIES ON TRACK DESPITE CHAOTIC PARTY POLICIES</p>
<p>India's politicians are busy doing what they do best; indulging in political squabbles and party infighting that have little to do with running the country and everything to do with increasing personal prestige and advantage.</p>
<p>Mounting allegations of corruption in the recent Congress Government, mostly involving former prime minister Narasimha Rao, are adding spice (and complications) to the events.</p>
<p>The United Front (UF) government's prime minister, Deve Gowda, spends much of his time putting out fires he and others have accidentally lighted within his 14-party coalition.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his government is stronger than it looks and it is keeping its core economic and foreign policies on track.</p>
<p>The UF is not doing too badly; but Congress is hit by growing corruption scandals:</p>
<p>**  As parliament resumes this week for the winter session, the political scene is riven with party power battles in the Congress Party and in the main opposition BJP, while Gowda's fractious 14-party coalition is hit by internal squabbles.</p>
<p>**  The most significant dissension is in the Congress Party which is also hit by extensive corruption scandals, the most recent involving telecom contracts.</p>
<p>This could unseat Rao from the party leadership and his departure would cause serious political uncertainty because the UF could be destabilised by Congress MPs, including some leaders, trying to scramble aboard.</p>
<p>**  Also significant is dissension within the BJP in various states, particularly Gujarat where the party runs the state government.</p>
<p>Events like these are losing the BJP its reputation as a disciplined responsible party.</p>
<p>**  Squabbles in the UF are grabbing a lot of headlines and they are diverting Gowda and some other ministers from policy work, but they do not run deep and there is no sign of any significant rift.</p>
<p>State elections in Uttar Pradesh (UP), which are expected in about a month's time, will however strain loyalties.</p>
<p>**  Firm government decisions are being taken and implemented in some areas following last month's budget, especially in the industry and power ministries.</p>
<p>On nuclear disarmament, the foreign minister is adopting a robust approach with the U.S. that indicates a new self confidence in Indian foreign policy.</p>
<p>Despite outward appearances, the Gowda coalition is not doing too badly. The forecast that it should last for at least a year (made when it came to power) remains unchanged - but that could be affected by events in the Congress Party.</p>
<p>		     CONGRESS AND CORRUPTION</p>
<p>Congress Needs A New Leader To Replace Rao:</p>
<p>Corrupt and demoralised, Congress is in a mess and needs a new leader - but no one is prepared to force the issue. If it is to win a future election, the Congress needs to change dramatically, re-identifying its priorities and making policies relate to its traditional poor and low caste constituencies.</p>
<p>Above all, it needs to clean out its organisation. Many Congress leaders would like to remove Mr Rao, whose reputation has slumped in a morass of corruption scandals, from either or both of his dual roles as president of the party and its parliamentary leader.</p>
<p>But they all have their own agendas and they all fear that a rival might benefit if they wield the knife. They are now waiting for Mr Rao to be charged and/or be forced to appear in court on one of the scandals, because then he would almost certainly have to resign.</p>
<p>Mr Rao is clinging to office to try to save his skin. He knows that he will be finished politically if he is ousted and that he will lose much of his behind-the-scenes influence and negotiating power. So he wants to stay around long enough for the cases to go away (as they tend to do in India).</p>
<p>His alternative is to spend the rest of his life fighting to avoid conviction.</p>
<p>			BJP IMAGE SLIPPING</p>
<p>The BJP Has Problems In Gujarat:</p>
<p>The BJP has split in Gujarat, undermining its state government, and it has problems in other states. This is bad news for the BJP nationally because it needs to nurture its image of a well disciplined, clean, and effective party that can govern at national and state level.</p>
<p>Instead, it is beginning to prove itself little different from other parties, with self-seeking rows and splits. The battles centre around personal power and prestige, not policy issues.</p>
<p>They stem partly from rivalry between new low (or backward) caste leaders and the BJP's traditional high caste base which is supported by its important extremist wing, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).</p>
<p>The ructions open the way for Congress and United Front parties to undermine the BJP by liaising with the dissidents.</p>
<p>This is happening in Gujarat, where the BJP government is vulnerable, having lost possibly a third of its assembly members and seven ministers to a break-away party.</p>
<p>There are also tensions in Maharashtra between the BJP and its partner in the state government, the Shiv Sena Party. In UP, there is also dissension ahead of state elections.</p>
<p>		    COALITION GOVERNMENT TENSIONS</p>
<p>Squabbles Among United Front Parties:</p>
<p>No one expected the 14-party coalition to work well, and in fact it is doing better than expected. Mr Gowda's problems grab headlines and divert him and some other Ministers from policy work.</p>
<p>There is however no sign of any significant rift, though Mr Gowda's actions have led to accusations that he is favouring his home state of Karnataka and does not yet have national vision.</p>
<p>For example, decisions regarding a dam at Alamatti in southern India, which favour Karnataka rather than the adjacent state of Andhra Pradesh (AP), have led to a coalition crisis with Chandrababhu Naidu, chief minister of AP, threatening to break away from the United Front.</p>
<p>The coming state elections in UP will strain loyalties further.</p>
<p>Some United Front leaders are causing problems. Indrajit Gupta, the communist Home Minister, has caused mini-crises because of public indescretions, but they soon pass.</p>
<p>Mulayam Singh Yadav, defence minister, is primarily interested in politicking ahead of the UP state elections, and he might fall out with the coalition in due course.</p>
<p>C.M. Ibrahim, the high profile minister of both information and aviation who comes from Karnataka, is becoming controversial because he works primarily as a close aide and emissary for the prime minister.</p>
<p>Laloo Prasad Yadav, chief minister of Bihar and president of Mr Gowda's Janata Party, is showing signs of frustration because he has no significant national role, which could lead to a row.</p>
<p>But Mr Gowda responds by playing politics. His game plan appears to be to court his main players to keep them happy, while suddenly taking unexpected actions that destabilise his opponents, and sometimes his colleagues.</p>
<p>The best and latest example is a 90-minute meeting he held at a Bombay film star's house last week with Bal Thackeray, leader of the Hindu chauvinist Shiv Sena party that runs the Maharashtra state government in coalition with the BJP.</p>
<p>That may have been aimed at some sort of liaison with the Shiv Sena in the UP elections or elsewhere, but it upset Mr Gowda's secular colleagues and rattled the BJP.</p>
<p>			   POLICY DEVELOPMENTS</p>
<p>Positive Moves On Most Foreign Investment:</p>
<p>Foreign direct investment (FDI) and power project approvals are being speeded up. The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has speeded up its approvals procedure and has cleared over 200 foreign investments since mid-July, including a controversial wholly-owned subsidiary for Quaker Oats, and others including Coca-Cola, Carlsberg beer, and BMW.</p>
<p>An increase from 51 to 75 percent in Daewoo's equity holding in a car joint venture with DCM has also been approved. Power project counter guarantees are being accelerated, with a target of September 30 for all of them to be cleared, and Enron's Dabhol project is about to get under way again.</p>
<p>But blockages remain, especially on media and aviation. A Financial Times joint venture with Business Standard has been rejected by the cabinet committee on foreign investments, which ordered a policy review of a 1955 ban on foreign investment in newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>This is a highly controversial issue, and the prime minister has said several times recently that such investment will not be allowed. The FT and other similar projects seem unlikely therefore to be approved in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Mr Ibrahim has also spoken out against foreign investment in his ministerial area of aviation, as well as information. Foreign companies also seem likely to be banned in a parliamentary bill due later this year from transmitting (or uplinking) satellite TV programmes from India.</p>
<p>The Industry Ministry has not yet finalised its promised FDI guidelines. These are intended to list industries that are to be freed from industrial licensing, and those that are to be regarded as low priority for foreign investment.</p>
<p>Consumer perishable goods were to be regarded as low priority, but the recent approvals show that the government has softened its line. Murasoli Maran, industry minister, said last week that he favours such investments if they add value in terms of employment, technology and exports.</p>
<p>On industrial licensing, there are arguments within the coalition about liberalising the sugar industry.</p>
<p>Firm Stand On Nuclear Disarmament:</p>
<p>I.K. Gujral, Foreign Minister, is adopting a robust approach on nuclear issues. His refusal to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, despite intense pressure from the US and other countries, has clarified India's stand.</p>
<p>As a potential-but-undeclared nuclear state, it refuses to sign a treaty that does not commit nuclear states to eventual nuclear disarmament (it is specially concerned about China). This indicates a new self-confidence in India foreign policy.</p>
<p>This stand is unlikely to have an economic fallout. Furious though the US is with India, it is unlikely to try to start economic or other sanctions.</p>
<p>Such a move would be extremely unpopular in the US at a time when India is a primary target for foreign investment, and it would meet with little support from other countries.</p>
