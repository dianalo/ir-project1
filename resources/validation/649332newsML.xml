<title>KENYA: Rare mountain gorillas die in New Congo fighting.</title>

<p>Four rare mountain gorillas were killed in crossfire in Laurent Kabila's Congo in May, the International Gorilla Conservation Programme said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>There are only about 650 mountain gorillas in the world.</p>
<p>The four dead gorillas were caught in crossfire in the Virunga National Park between soldiers of Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo and ethnic Rwandan Hutu Interahamwe militia and allied former Rwandan soldiers.</p>
<p>&quot;Certain sectors of the park are still very vulnerable and security cannot be guaranteed,&quot; the conservationists said.</p>
<p>In August 1995, the dominant silverback male gorilla called Luwawa was killed by armed poachers coming from the Kibumba refugee camp, near the eastern Congo town of Goma.</p>
<p>&quot;On 18 May 1997, the same family with a new silverback called Kabirizi, was caught in gunfire between warring factions. Four gorillas were killed in this habituated family,&quot; the conservationists said, naming Kabirizi as one of the victims.</p>
<p>The conservation group said that the Interahamwe militia and former Rwandan soldiers used the Virunga National Park as a &quot;rear base for their operations to destabilise Rwanda&quot;.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman at the International Gorilla Conservation Programme in the Kenyan capital Nairobi said that it had taken a long time to confirm the deaths because of communication problems.</p>
<p>&quot;Only now have the deaths been confirmed,&quot; said Norah Ayee. &quot;Communication with that area of (former) Zaire is difficult.&quot;</p>
<p>Kabila's forces last month won the civil war in Zaire, which Kabila renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo. Rwandan Interahamwe militia and former soldiers are blamed for the killing of around 800,000 minority ethnic Tutsis and their allied moderate Hutus in Rwanda in 1994.</p>
<p>The Interahamwe and former soldiers refuse to return to Rwanda because of fears of reprisals for their role in the slaughter.</p>
