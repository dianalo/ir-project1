<p>PictureTel Corp said Monday it expects to report revenue in the range of $110 million to $115 million and a small operating loss for the second quarter.</p>
<p>The company said it is too early to forecast net results.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 1996, the company said it reported revenue of $116 million and earnings per share of $0.24.  </p>
<p>Analysts had expected the telecommunications software company to earn $0.10 per shr in the second quarter, according to First Call.</p>
<p>The company issued a news release saying it experienced unexpectedly soft demand during the last two weeks of the quarter, a period that was expected to represent about 40 percent of the total revenue for the quarter.</p>
<p>Such weakness occurred in both the United States and European operations and includes all product lines, the company said.  </p>
<p>PictureTel said it believes the weakness is due in part to market confusion regarding the rapid pace of technology change.</p>
<p>PictureTel said expected results also reflect a continuing shift in the company's product mix and lower overall average selling prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Such weakness is expected to continue for the next several quarters,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;In response to this lower-than-expected demand, the company is evaluating all aspects of its operations and will reduce its cost structure in the third quarter,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>PictureTel said it will announce its complete financial results for the second quarter on July 15.  </p>
<p>A company spokesman declined to say whether PictureTel will lay off employees as part of its planned cost cutting.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to look at all the available ways to reduce costs,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;There could be charges related to the cost cutting actions, but that has not yet been determined.&quot;</p>
