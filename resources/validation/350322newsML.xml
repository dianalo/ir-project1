<title>USA: Rockwell to ramp up K56 chip production.</title>
<headline>Rockwell to ramp up K56 chip production.</headline>

<p>Rockwell International Corp said Monday it plans to make more than a million of its new K56 modem chips sets monthly in the second calender quarter of this year with shipments of a million or more by June.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to ramp up very quickly the volume production of our chipsets,&quot; Dwight Decker, president of Rockwell Semiconductors Systems said in a teleconference.</p>
<p>&quot;By June we would be shipping, under our expectations, in excess of a million units a month and then it will continue to grow from there ... It will certainly grow to more than a million units a month,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>The new K56 modem chip sets will allow consumers to connect to the Internet over conventional telephone lines at almost twice the rate of currently available speeds.</p>
<p>Decker said the company expects modems using the K56 chip will be available in retail stores sometime in March adding that he expects them to be priced at about $200 each.</p>
<p>&quot;By June I would expect there be between two, three, four million units already deployed in the field,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The new Rockwell technology will compete with the &quot;x2&quot; modems being launched by U.S. Robotics Corp. The two technologies are not compatible which may mean on-line service providers may have to offer separate access numbers for end-users.</p>
<p>&quot;It may be confusing for some of these end users and that's unfortunate,&quot; Decker said. &quot;Some of the individual network providers may need to support both technologies to get their subscribers the service that they want ... it's more confusing that I think everybody would like to see.&quot;</p>
