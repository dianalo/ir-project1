<p>Stocks closed higher on Wednesday for the fourth consecutive session with buying focused on recent laggards smaller-capitalised shares, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said manufacturing blue chips suffered from profit-taking and the yen's weakness.</p>
<p>&quot;Rotational buying of blue chips came to an end. Instead, investors are seeking short-term profits from smaller-cap shares,&quot; said Ha Ki-ho of Jardine Fleming Securities.</p>
<p>Lee Hee-myung of Samsung Securities said: &quot;The market seems overheated. It needs a consolidation.&quot;</p>
<p>The composite stock index closed at 698.66, up 3.69 points.  </p>
<p>Brokers said the market largely ignored a proposal for short-term banking reforms by a presidential advisory panel as the move had been widely expected.</p>
<p>The financial sub-index fell 1.93 points to 513.16 but brokers attributed the fall to profit-taking.</p>
<p>Chungbuk Bank went limit-up, gaining 340 won to 4,600, on hopes the banks would be a target of merger and acquisition eventually.</p>
<p>Investment trust companies, major institutional buyers, accumulated chipmaking stocks in the belief a recovery was imminent for the memory chip industry.  </p>
<p>Samsung Electronics rose 300 won to 6,450, LG Semicon 900 won to 30,600 and Hyundai Electronics 1,400 won to 41,900.</p>
<p>Brokers said the yen's weakness sparked worries about weakening competitiveness of Korean exporters against their Japanese rivals.</p>
<p>They said smaller companies would come into spotlight for the time being as investors were uncertain about the prospect for big manufacturers.</p>
