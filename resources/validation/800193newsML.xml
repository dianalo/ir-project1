<title>USA: Judge blocks Greenpeace bid to halt Arco oil drilling.</title>
<headline>Judge blocks Greenpeace bid to halt Arco oil drilling.</headline>

<p>A federal judge on Wednesday rejected a bid by the environmental group Greenpeace to stop a rig belonging to oil giant Atlantic Richfield Co. from drilling for oil just off Alaska's northern coast.</p>
<p>While the court hearing was being held in Los Angeles, a Greenpeace ship blocked the rig, the MV Arctic Sunrise, from moving from its position about three miles (5 km) off the coast near the giant Prudhoe Bay oil field to a new drilling area in the Beaufort Sea.</p>
<p>A Greenpeace spokesman at the scene said by telephone that about 35 protesters were aboard the blocking vessel along with several smaller rafts.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Federal Court Judge Ronald Lew refused to issue a restraining order sought by Greenpeace against Los Angeles-based Arco. He said, &quot;Arco's hardship -- the potential loss of its leases -- greatly outweighs the harm Greenpeace claims.&quot;</p>
<p>Greenpeace spokeswoman Kalee Kreider said in Washington, &quot;When push comes to shove, Arco's profit is more important than damage to the environment.&quot;</p>
<p>She said the protestors were willing to stay in the area through Aug. 31 which would be the beginning of the whaling season when she claimed federal law would prohibit the rig from going to its new destination.</p>
<p>Greenpeace said the mobile rig, moored near about 75 miles (120 km) east of its new drilling site in the Beaufort Sea, could disturb protected marine mammals.</p>
<p>As part of a stepped-up campaign to curb global warming, Greenpeace is protesting worldwide oil exploration and is currently staging a similar disruption against an oil platform in the North Atlantic operated by British Petroleum Co. Plc.</p>
<p>An Arco spokesman said he was pleased with the court decision but declined further comment.</p>
