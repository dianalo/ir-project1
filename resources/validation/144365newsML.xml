<title>UK: FORECAST-Refining holds back Shell.</title>
<headline>FORECAST-Refining holds back Shell.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-25</dateline>

<p>Surprisingly strong oil prices will have helped third-quarter results at Royal Dutch/Shell Group, but persistently weak refining margins will have held back the profit rise, analysts said.</p>
<p>Some even predict that higher refining costs will have offset the higher crude prices, forecasting flat to slightly lower earnings for the period, which Shell reports on Thursday.</p>
<p>Forecasts for current cost net profit vary between 1,152 and 1,280 million stg compared with 1,163 million a year earlier. The estimates are before currency losses, expected to be some 20 million stg due to the pound's strength against the dollar.  </p>
<p>Analysts' current cost estimates strip out swings in oil stock values due to commodity price changes.</p>
<p>Average Brent crude oil prices were $21 per barrel in the third quarter, which was over a dollar more than in the previous quarter and four dollars more than a year ago.</p>
<p>This means a massive boost to upstream results, but also higher costs for the downstream business which was already suffering from overcapacitynearly all across the world.</p>
<p>In addition, chemical results will be lower than in 1995's third quarter when the industry was only just past the peak of its cycle.  </p>
<p>But while the environment for the chemicals sector will likely improve as economies pick up, the outlook for refining and marketing of oil products is expected to remain gloomy for some time, analysts said.</p>
<p>And while crude prices may spike up more in case of a cold spell, most analysts see oil drift back in the medium term to levels of about $20 per barrel.</p>
<p>&quot;They (oil firms) may struggle to improve their profits very much from here,&quot; said Nick Antill at BZW.</p>
<p>This means oil stocks such as Royal Dutch Petroleum and Shell Transport and Trading, which is the British arm of the group, are vulnerable to profit taking, he added.</p>
<p>But higher oil and gas production volumes should offset a lower oil price trend, say others.</p>
<p>John Toalster at SocGen said he sees net profits at Royal Dutch/Shell Group rising to 6.5 billion stg in 1997 from a forecast 5.5 billion stg for the full 1996 year.</p>
