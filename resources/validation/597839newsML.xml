<p>Pakistan's much-anticipated floating rate note issue was one of the highlights of a busy Asian debt market on Tuesday.</p>
<p>As expected, the issue size was increased from the US$100 million that was the minimum amount to be launched.</p>
<p>The US$300 million in notes have a three-year maturity and were priced to yield 395 basis points over comparable U.S. Treasuries. ANZ Investment Bank was lead manager.</p>
<p>That spread was a bit tighter than the pre-launch price talk of around 400 basis points.</p>
<p>Stephen Finch, director of new issues at ANZ Investment Bank in London, said the issue featured a wide geographical distribution.</p>
<p>&quot;We sold about 10-15 percent in Asia, about the same amount to offshore funds in the U.S. and the rest was about evenly split between Europe and the Middle East,&quot; said Finch.</p>
<p>Debt funds were the biggest investors, but private investors and Asian regional banks also participated, he said.</p>
<p>A group for the issue has been formed and the syndicate will break in the London afternoon.</p>
<p>The issue has been rated B2 by Moody's Investors Service.</p>
<p>Malaysian companies also featured in an active Asian debt market on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Malaysian Airline set a 30 billion yen bond that was quickly increased to 40 billion yen. The five-year issue was priced at par and pays a semi-annual coupon of 2.55 percent.</p>
<p>Daiwa Securities (HK) was lead manager.</p>
<p>The issue followed Monday's yen floating rate note issue for Malaysian Air, a five-year FRN that pays a margin of 25 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate.</p>
<p>Fees are 15 basis points for the FRN, which was lead managed by Daiwa and Sanwa International Finance.</p>
<p>Both the bond and the FRN can be put if the Minister of Finance ceases to hold preference shares in the borrower.</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan Asia brought a US$50 million FRN for Mycom Capital. The three-year deal pays 175 basis points over LIBOR and offers 20 basis points in fees to the top tier.</p>
<p>Another Malaysian company, Mancon, has a US$100 million FRN in the market via lead manager Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Malaysian credits have become increasingly popular as investors seek out investment-grade alternatives among Asian issuers now that South Korean and Thai issuers have turned quiet.</p>
<p>In the loan markets, Hong Kong's CITIC Pacific has mandated five banks to arrange a HK$8 billion loan facility.</p>
<p>Banque Nationale de Paris Hong Kong branch, Chase Manhattan Asia, HSBC Investment Bank Asia, Hang Seng Bank and J.P. Morgan Securities Asia are the coordinating arrangers and underwriters.</p>
<p>Proceeds of the loan will be used for refinancing of existing debts and for general corporate purposes, the arrangers said in a statement.</p>
<p>Earlier today, bankers said CITIC Pacific was planning to raise HK$8.0 billion to help fund its investment in China Light and Power Co.</p>
<p>They said the loan would be used for working capital and to repay a short-term HK$12.5 billion bridging loan signed in February to help fund the company's HK$16.25 billion acquisition of 20 percent of CLP.</p>
<p>The HK$12.5 billion bridging loan had a tenor of less than one year and was not syndicated.</p>
<p>On May 9, CITIC Pacific said it had agreed to sell a 7.74 percent stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd for HK$11.4 billion.</p>
