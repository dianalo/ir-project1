<headline>ICN Pharmaceuticals forms joint venture in China.</headline>

<p>ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., pursuing its strategy of getting an early foothold in emerging markets, said Wednesday that it was forming a joint venture with a local company in China's Jiangsu province.</p>
<p>ICN said it will own 75 percent of the new venture, to be called Wuxi ICN Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, and Wuxi Pharmaceutical Corp. will own the rest.</p>
<p>&quot;A key element of ICN's long-term business strategy is to move early into burgeoning pharmaceutical markets,&quot; ICN Chief Executive Milan Panic said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;By putting the infrastructure in place now, ICN will be uniquely poised to grow and profit as these countries turn to privatised pharmaceutical companies for medicines and other healthcare products.&quot;</p>
<p>ICN, which is based in Costa Mesa, Calif. and operates in more than 60 countries, said the deal was similar to two others it has undertaken in Yugoslavia and Russia. In both countries, ICN obtained controlling interests of local companies that were previously government-owned.</p>
<p>The company, which manufactures and markets a broad range of prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, said the joint venture in China will immediately begin building a $24 million manufacturing plant in Wuxi.</p>
<p>The venture in eastern China is expected to employ about 1,550 people, ICN said.</p>
<p>ICN's stock lost 25 cents to $19.125 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
