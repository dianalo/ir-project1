<title>UK: Brent shivers keep North Sea markets cool.</title>
<headline>Brent shivers keep North Sea markets cool.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>North Sea crudes were unable to throw off a cold caught last week as the benchmark Brent market shivered and other grades showed few signs of improvement, traders said.</p>
<p>Physical Brent traded twice on Monday, at Dec Brent -35 cents for a Nov 15-17 cargo and at Dec Brent -42 cents for a Nov 13-15 loader.</p>
<p>With a sickly Brent/WTI spread keeping the transatlantic arbitrage closed, a potential seller valued the North Sea marker grade at Dec Brent -40 cents, some five cents weaker than on Friday.  </p>
<p>&quot;People still believe the next deal will be done at a lower number than the last,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Further evidence of weakness at the front end of the market emerged as the Nov/Dec paper spread slipped further into contango, trading at -4 cents after being offered at parity in early dealing. Best bids were coming from -7 cents late in the London session, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dec/Jan also eased to talk at +30/+34 cents.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs painted an equally discouraging picture for sellers, valuing the balance of this week at Dec Brent -40/-35 cents and next week at -36/-30 cents.  </p>
<p>Forties managed to cling to a narrow premium to Dated Brent, but sellers of other grades were coy about differentials achieved.</p>
<p>Two Forties, loading Nov 20-22 and Nov 21-23 fetched Dated Brent +5 cents. Norwegian cargoes were said to have traded but details could not be confirmed, although one seller described the market as &quot;stable at around last week's levels.&quot;</p>
<p>Nigerian crudes were talking in a two-tiered market with Bonny Light cargoes loading before Nov 25 valued at least five cents below those discussed in late November or early December.</p>
