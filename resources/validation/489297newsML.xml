<p>United States Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Saturday that U.S. long-term interest rates remain consistent with solid growth.</p>
<p>Rubin also told Reuters Financial Television that there was no evidence that the U.S. stock market's recent fall will hurt the economy, and repeated that currencies should not be used as trade tools.</p>
<p>Referring to the rise in U.S. bond yields after Friday's release of the latest U.S. unemployment figures, Rubin said long-term rates in the United States were still consistent with solid growth.</p>
<p>Because the United States is tackling its budget deficit, &quot;there is no longer a deficit premium on long-term rates,&quot; that would keep them above levels otherwise justified by economic fundamentals. He said that there was no evidence that the recent fall in the U.S. stock market had affected the fundamental outlook of the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;It would not affect my economic projection,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rubin, who visited Tokyo before coming here for a meeting of to the Asia-Pacific finance ministers, denied that he had warned Japan against a resurgence of its trade surplus.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not warning anyone,&quot; Rubin said, noting that Japanese policymakers themselves support that goal.</p>
<p>He reiterated his opposition to the manipulation of currencies to try to solve trade problems. &quot;One does not approach these issues with currencies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rubin is in the Philippine resort island to attend the three-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) finance ministers' forum, which ends Sunday.</p>
