<p>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. said Monday it sold one third of its 30 percent interest in the financial information and media firm Bloomberg LP to Bloomberg Inc. and recorded a pre-tax gain of about $155 million on the sale.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch said the transaction will reduce its stake in Bloomberg to 20 percent.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Merrill Lynch estimated that the firm paid about $39 million for its 30 percent interest in Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Inc., the investment vehicle controlled by Michael Bloomberg, president and CEO of the limited partnership Bloomberg LP.</p>
<p>The nation's largest brokerage house, which first invested in Bloomberg in 1985, said it would remain a partner in the company despite the sale of part of its stake.</p>
<p>&quot;Merrill Lynch's involvement with Bloomberg began as a strategic investment to provide systems and analytics for our institutional business and to develop an information delivery capability for the marketplace,&quot; said Daniel Tully, chairman and chief executive officer of Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>&quot;Bloomberg has now evolved into a leading financial information and media company and our initial strategic objectives have ben achieved,&quot; he said. &quot;It is now in our mutual interest for Merrill Lynch to recognise some of the value of its invstment.&quot;</p>
<p>After making its initial investment in 1985, the brokerage house increased its stake to 30 percent by 1990.</p>
<p>Tully said Merrill Lynch will remain a major customer as well as partner of Bloomberg, which provides financial information, analytics and news through 67,000 terminals worldwide. It provides general and business news via Bloomberg Information Television, the Bloomberg Radio Network and Bloomberg print publications.</p>
