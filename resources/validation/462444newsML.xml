<p>Boca Juniors had two players sent off and threw away a three goal lead as they drew 3-3 with River Plate in the meeting of Argentina's oldest and most bitter rivals on Sunday.</p>
<p>River, unbeaten in the Clausura championship and with only one goal conceded in their previous five matches, let in three goals in the first 29 minutes and appeared to be on the road to a hammering in their own Monumental stadium.</p>
<p>But Uruguayans Gabriel Cedres and Sergio Martinez, who shared the Boca goals between them, turned from heroes to villians when they were both sent off in the second half.</p>
<p>River, who pulled a goal back before halftime and then scored twice in the last quarter of an hour, also had one player sent off.</p>
<p>Cedres scored in the fifth minute with Martinez adding two goals in the 17th and 29th minutes as Boca took total control in the first half.</p>
<p>River, depleted by injury, had barely troubled the Boca rearguard until Sergio Berti converted a penalty in the 41st minute to get them back into the game.</p>
<p>In the second half, Boca fell apart after Martinez was dismissed for a second bookable offence and Cedres was shown the red card for elbowing an opponent.</p>
<p>Facundo Villalba pulled another goal back in the 75th minute and Paraguayan defender Celso Ayala grabbed the equaliser for River two minutes from time to salvage their unbeaten record.</p>
<p>River, who had Eduardo Berizzo dismissed for two bookable offences, lead unrated Colon, who beat Estudiantes 3-1, on goal difference with Newell's Old Boys and San Lorenzo one point behind.</p>
<p>Boca, who have become used to languishing in mid-table in recent years despite being the country's most fervently supported club, are ninth.</p>
<p>The Clausura is the second of two tournaments played in the Argentine season.</p>
