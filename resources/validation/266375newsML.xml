<p>The deputy head of Bulgaria's parliamentary commission against corruption wrote to the chief prosecutor on Thursday asking him to investigate Prime Minister Zhan Videnov's business links.</p>
<p>Edvin Sugarev, a member of parliament from the opposition Union of Democratic Forces, said Videnov and other senior officials had permitted the establishment of a group of companies known as the Orion Group and done nothing to curb their activities.</p>
<p>&quot;Orion has caused significant losses to different state and private financial institutions,&quot; he said in the letter to chief prosecutor Ivan Tatarchev, a copy of which was sent to Reuters.</p>
<p>Sugarev asked Tatarchev to investigate Videnov and six other senior officials for cases of corruption, misuse of public funds and abuse of power.</p>
<p>&quot;Zhan Videnov has full information on the illegal activity of Orion and its bank, the Bulgarian Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and despite this, he has done nothing to prevent the damage they cause the state, private individuals, and agricultural corporations,&quot; the letter said.</p>
<p>The Sofia City Court cancelled the bank's registration earlier this year, citing legal inconsistencies in the list of shareholders, and appointed liquidators to close it down.</p>
<p>A home-made car bomb damaged the chief liquidator's car on October 31 but no one was hurt.</p>
<p>Orion was at the centre of a political row last year after Bulgaria exported large quantities of grain for high world prices, creating shortages at home.</p>
<p>Videnov has denied in Parliament that there are any formal links between companies known as the Orion group because they bear the names of stars in the Orion constellation. He says there are only &quot;a friendly circle&quot;.</p>
<p>Sugarev's letter also cited irregularities at the state refinery Neftohim and the State Savings Bank, and condemned central bank governor Lyubomir Filipov for permitting the refinancing of collapsing state and private commercial banks, which Sugarev said had caused losses worth 10 billion levs.</p>
<p>A quarter of Bulgaria's numerous and illiquid banks are now in receivership. Loss of confidence in the banking system caused a run on the lev, which has fallen from 70 to the dollar at the beginning of the year to about 500 now.</p>
<p>Videnov is under pressure both from the opposition and from reformists in his Socialist party over his handling of the economic crisis. A party congress this weekend will discuss reformists' calls for a new cabinet and for separation of the functions of party chairman and prime minister.</p>
