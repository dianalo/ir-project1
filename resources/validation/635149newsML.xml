<title>UK: Mark retreats as broad-EMU concern gains ground.</title>
<headline>Mark retreats as broad-EMU concern gains ground.</headline>

<p>The mark retreated on its crosses in morning Europe amid concern the future European single currency will be launched by a broad group of countries and will not be as strong as the mark.</p>
<p>Expectations Italy and Spain will be among the founders of economic and monetary union grew after the French left won power in Sunday's elections. A row between the Bundesbank and the German government over plans to revalue the central bank's assets has fuelled such talk.</p>
<p>&quot;The gold debacle and the French elections are the overriding focus and are making people think the euro will be a soft currency,&quot; said Mark Geddes, a treasury economist at ABN Amro. &quot;This will keep the mark under pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>The mark's weakness helped several EMS currencies strengthen above their central parities against the German unit in Europe's exchange rate mechanism. The markka's rise spurred the Bank of Finland to buy marks at about 3.0050 markka, traders said.</p>
<p>Mark/French franc was at 3.3713/18 at 0820 GMT versus 3.3720/25 late Monday in Europe. The lira was at 984.00/20 per mark, almost 0.7 percent stronger than its ERM parity, against 983.35/65 yesterday, while mark/markka was at 3.0040/70 compared to 3.009/012.  </p>
<p>Lionel Jospin, who took office as prime minister Tuesday, has urged Italy and Spain be included in EMU from the outset.</p>
<p>Speculation the euro won't be as hard as had been expected also intensified after Francois Hollande, a spokesman for the victorious Socialists, said Monday the government did not want punitive fines to be levied after EMU.</p>
<p>The details of the stability pact, agreed at the European Union's Dublin summit in December 1996, say countries should be fined if they don't keep their budget deficits in check after joining the single currency.</p>
<p>While traders expect the German government to resist such moves, Bonn's authority is being undermined by its fight with the Bundesbank over the asset revaluation plan.</p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Helmut Hesse said Monday the government's plan to improve its fiscal position in time for EMU by revaluing reserves was &quot;comparable to creative accounting.&quot; He also said it would erode public confidence in the single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The gold fiasco makes it difficult for Germany to exclude Italy from EMU,&quot; said Ian Amstad, an economist at Bankers Trust. &quot;The market is a true believer in the EMU process, but is now putting a higher probability on a soft EMU.&quot;</p>
<p>The Swiss franc was underpinned by such expectations, though the Swiss National Bank has managed to prevent it surging higher by daily pumping liquidity into the money market. Mark/Swiss was last at 82.83 centimes from 82.83/86 yesterday.</p>
