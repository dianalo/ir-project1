<p>Shares closed almost flat at the main indices on Monday as the dollar turned higher in the European afternoon, boosting cyclical stocks and taking Nokia off its earlier lows which had dragged others, brokers said.</p>
<p>Telecommunications major and bourse engine Nokia pared losses to end off two markka at 469.00 after a brief attempt in positive ground in the afternoon, after falling to a 461 markka session low in the morning.</p>
<p>The HEX general index closed down 0.25 percent at 3,600.54 after dipping to 3,569.7 earlier, and the FOX derivatives and portfolio benchmark closed up 0.02 percent at 1,235.6 points.</p>
<p>Brokers said volume was relatively lively at 730 million markka despite uncertaintly this week caused by U.S. data. Nokia accounted for over half of total volume.</p>
<p>&quot;This was quite a special market today, cyclicals gained and others were not in too good shape,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>There was also uncertainty about German Bundesbank's fixed rate weekly repo tender on Tuesday amid some speculation that Buba may move to a variable rate and let rates drift higher.</p>
<p>The ongoing study on cooperation between  state-controlled energy groups Neste and IVO fuelled merger speculation, and Neste rose 7.00 markka or over five percent to 144.00.</p>
<p>Finland's leading banking group Merita fell 0.60 markka to 22.90 on interest rate jitters and on profit-taking ahead of its H1 report due early on Wednesday, they said. Since end-June, Merita has risen over 30 percent, from 17.30 markka.</p>
<p>U.S. July retail sales and PPI on Wednesday, July CPI and industrial production on Thursday would be the next data in focus, brokers said.</p>
<p>Friday's domestic July CPI and industry output seen less important, though indicative of what may happen in Finnish interest rates, brokers said.</p>
