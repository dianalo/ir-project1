<p>Israel must rein in public spending to lay the groundwork for wider economic reform and inspire the central bank to loosen interest rates, Israel's Finance Minister Dan Meridor said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Meridor, speaking at an investment conference here, said he aimed to trim the government's budget deficit to 2.8 percent from the current 4.0 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Government policy needs budget cuts as a prerequisite,&quot; Meridor told reporters after his speech. &quot;If you don't cut the budget the rest is not important.&quot;  </p>
<p>The minister predicted that the government would face a battle in parliament to win approval, but would eventually secure the reductions. &quot;We want to cut the deficit to a reasonable size and I think we will do it.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bank of Israel would respond to tighter fiscal policy by easing interest rates, Meridor said. He declined comment whether the Bank of Israel acted agressively enough in trimming its key lending rate for October by 0.3 percentage points to an annualized 15.5 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;What we need to do is cut the budget and lower interest rates,&quot; Meridor said. &quot;About the order of actions, I would not go into that now.&quot;</p>
<p>The capital market reforms unveiled earlier this month should promote long-term savings, the minister said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am bringing  (the proposed reforms) to the cabinet discussion of October 30, and I recommend the government approves them,&quot; he said, adding that, while details might change, the plan would win parliamentary approval.</p>
<p>Meridor reaffirmed the Israeli government's commitment to privatizing state industries, increasing industrial competitiveness and promoting economic growth, but said deficit cutting must come first.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth is very important to our agenda and we want to promote it not by government acitvity but by getting government off the shoulders of the economic agents, so they can act on their own discretion,&quot; Meridor said.</p>
