<p>Ministers from the 29 OECD nations meet for an annual summit here next week, with Russia hammering on the door for membership but having little chance of a speedy invitation to join the international free-market organisation.</p>
<p>Donald Johnston, who will host the meeting for the first time since becoming secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development last year, said on Tuesday that Russian membership was a long-term goal.</p>
<p>&quot;I wrote to the Russian prime minister to tell him that the ultimate shared goal was accession,&quot; Johnston, a former Canadian cabinet minister, told reporters at a briefing.</p>
<p>But he added that Russia, which requested membership this time last year, had a long way to go to meet entry conditions in terms of economic liberalisation and privatisations, the battle against corruption and establishing a sound system of taxation.</p>
<p>Ministers for trade, finance and social affairs are invited to the talks on Monday and Tuesday, with an agenda covering everything from the internationalisation of trade to fighting bribery of state officials and dealing with the OECD's own financial woes.</p>
<p>The OECD plans to revisit the debate over the economic benefits and social costs of competition between countries as well as companies with the trend towards ever more globalised trade.</p>
<p>In this domain, as with its stalled efforts to establish a pact on investment liberalisation, the meeting is expected to provide a forum for ministers to air their views and take stock of the situation rather than for negotiations.</p>
<p>Johnston said ministers would be asked to endorse OECD recommendations on the criminalisation of bribery of state officials. They would also try to hammer out how to apply the recommendations in practice.</p>
<p>The meeting at the OECD's Paris headquarters will come on the heels of an informal European Union summit in the Netherlands and a day after the first round of France's parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>It clashes on the Tuesday with the Paris signing of a pact between NATO and Russia which will give Moscow more say in the alliance's decisions and offers reassurances that the West will not move nuclear and other weapons closer to Russian borders.</p>
<p>Johnston said he was expecting a Russian delegation on the second day of the OECD meeting and hoped it would be led by Foreign Minister Yevegny Primakov, but he was not expecting President Boris Yeltsin, due in Paris for the NATO deal signing.</p>
<p>The Russian presence is also likely to add spark to a wider debate within the OECD about the pressure to embrace new members at a time when it is being forced to cut costs -- a debate which Johnston said could prove &quot;thorny&quot;.</p>
<p>In a change of style from his predecessor, Frenchman Jean-Claude Paye, Johnston said this year's OECD gathering would not be preceded by the traditional advance &quot;snapshot&quot; of economic forecasts for OECD member countries which the organisation releases in full in June.</p>
