<p>India's Reliance Industries is expected to announce sharply lower profits for the first half due to higher costs, lower product prices and flat volume growth, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Indian petrochemicals giant will unveil its first-half results for 1996/97 (April-March) on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The profits are going to be sharply down,&quot; said Jal Irani, petrochemicals analyst at Jardine Fleming India Broking.</p>
<p>Prices of the company's products were down by 20-25 percent, while its raw material costs, with the exception of ethylene, had gone up, he said.</p>
<p>Profits would also be hit by a new 12.9 percent minimum tax on companies that previously paid no taxes. The levy would eat up nearly 1.5 billion rupees ($42 million) of the firm's profits for the full year ending March 31, 1997, analysts said.</p>
<p>Reliance grew into India's largest private sector company by taking advantage of tax breaks on new investments.</p>
<p>Analysts forecast Reliance's net profit to fall by an average of 25.8 percent to 4.7 billion rupees ($131.8 million) in the first half against 6.3 billion in the year-ago period, a Reuter poll of 14 securities houses showed last month.</p>
<p>One analyst projected the net profit to hit 4.0 billion rupees while another saw it at 6.2 billion.</p>
<p>The poll forecast sales to fall 21.1 percent to an average 31.3 billion rupees.</p>
<p>&quot;The fall (in net profit) should be much more (than 25.8 percent),&quot; an analyst at a foreign securities firm said.</p>
<p>Reliance could beat the projections if it reports a big jump in other income. &quot;Otherwise, the writing is on the wall,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Other income usually are earnings from investments in securities or profit from sale of securities, both unrelated to the company's main business.</p>
<p>Some analysts believe that traders have taken into account the expected setback, leaving little surprise in store.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody has factored the disappointment,&quot; said Rupa Bose, strategist at Paribas Capital Markets. &quot;It's a disappointment that's expected.&quot;</p>
<p>Reliance shares were trading at 188.75 rupees on Wednesday afternoon at the Bombay Stock Exchange -- down 29.3 percent from 267.0 year's high reached on May 2.</p>
<p>Though adverse market conditions would impact Reliance's working, the performance would not be too bad, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;What I see is really a small erosion ... less than 10 percent (fall in profits) for the year,&quot; Bose said. &quot;I'm not going with the 30-40 percent fall some people talk of.&quot;</p>
