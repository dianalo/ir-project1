<p>The eldest daughter of Indonesia's long-serving President Suharto said her father was in good health, as debate over his future plans continued in the run-up to May 29 general elections.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank God, he is still healthy,&quot; Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana told Reuters on Sunday night in an interview on the campaign trail in central Java.</p>
<p>Suharto, aged 75 and now the world's second longest ruling leader after Cuba's Fidel Castro, underwent a thorough medical checkup in Germany in mid-1996 and was given a clean bill of health for a man his age.</p>
<p>Financial markets have been spooked in recent months, however, on unfounded rumours regarding his health.</p>
<p>Separately, Harmoko, head of the ruling Golkar party, told an election rally in Padang in West Sumatra on Monday that there was no need for any limits on the presidency.</p>
<p>&quot;The presidency does not need to be limited and Golkar clearly rejects any limits on the office of the president,&quot; Harmoko, who is also information minister, was quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency.</p>
<p>The succession is one of the key issues facing Indonesia and Suharto is widely expected to seek a seventh five-year term in office when the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) meets to select the president in March next year.</p>
<p>The 500-member House of Representatives (DPR), most of which will be selected at this month's poll at which Golkar is expected to easily win, makes up half of the MPR. Suharto then directly appoints another 500 members.</p>
<p>&quot;If the MPR choose the president again for another term, as long as it is chosen by the MPR, it is legal and not contradictory with the 1945 Constitution,&quot; Harmoko said.</p>
<p>Major policy moves and government changes normally follow the presidential election, rather than the general elections run a year before.</p>
<p>&quot;When it comes to questions whether he is ready or not to be re-appointed as the president, it will depend on the Indonesian people,&quot; his daughter Rukmana said.</p>
<p>Juwono Sudarsono, professor of politics at the University of Indonesia, recently told Reuters there was some uncertainty over the country's political future because it had been dominated by Suharto for so long.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people are worried about the absence of institutionalised and organised work below the presidency in case something happens to the president,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rukmana, 48, also known as Tutut, is a successful busineswoman and one of seven chairpersons of Golkar, one of three parties legally permitted to contest the general elections.</p>
<p>Her name has surfaced as a possible vice-president for Indonesia but she avoided any direct comment on her political future.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be up to the Indonesian people, because there is a mechanism that is through the representatives. I can't answer the question because the election is not over yet,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Some analysts suggest that Tutut, who is proving to be one of the most effective campaigners for Golkar, is being groomed to become overall head of the party, rather than vice-president of the nation.</p>
<p>Some political analysts believe current Vice-President Try Sutrisno may be re-elected, although Suharto has never had a two-term vice-president during his 30-year rule.</p>
<p>The vice-presidential post is under keen scrutiny given Suharto's age and the possibility that his next running mate may become president.</p>
