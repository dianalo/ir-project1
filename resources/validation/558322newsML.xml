<headline>UK's Labour pledges change, warns of &quot;bumpy ride&quot;.</headline>

<p>Britain's new Labour government on Sunday pledged a radical programme of change for the millennium while the defeated Conservatives took up positions for a leadership battle in their shattered party.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, still savouring the novelty of office after 18 years in opposition, said Britain faced a &quot;bumpy ride&quot; ahead.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tony Blair planned to shake up the nation in the same way he overhauled the Labour Party, Prescott said.</p>
<p>Blair spent Sunday finalising his cabinet list and among other appointments bestowed a ministerial post on Peter Mandelson, the man who meticulously plotted the Labour party's crushing election victory last week.</p>
<p>A government spokesman said Mandelson would become minister without portfolio to help the implementation of government policies and their effective presentation to the public.</p>
<p>Blair now has a stunning 179-seat majority, justifying his crusade to modernise the Labour party by junking old socialist dogma and silencing critics on the left.</p>
<p>With such strong backing in parliament, he is free to enact controversial legislation and fulfil his pledge of &quot;radical centrist&quot; rule.</p>
<p>&quot;He wants to see a new kind of Britain going into a new millennium and he'll have as much effect on British political life as he's had on the Labour Party in the last two or three years,&quot; Prescott said on BBC television.</p>
<p>&quot;Quite frankly, it may well be a bumpy ride but I'm looking forward to it.&quot;</p>
<p>On Saturday Blair announced a radical cabinet containing five women, one avowedly homosexual minister -- National Heritage Secretary Chris Smith -- and one blind minister, Education Secretary David Blunkett.</p>
<p>Blair promised to hit the ground running and has plenty on his plate, including the stalled peace talks in Northern Ireland and how to revive relations with the European Union.</p>
<p>Gerry Adams, head of the Irish Republican Army's political arm Sinn Fein, on Sunday urged Blair to forge a new peace in the divided province of Northern Ireland where tensions between Catholics and Protestants are running high.</p>
<p>Blair and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook were due to meet new Minister for Europe Doug Henderson on Sunday to discuss a EU meeting on Monday when Britain is set to take the first step towards signing the 15-nation bloc's Social Chapter.</p>
<p>Outgoing prime minister John Major refused to sign the Social Chapter -- set up to regulate working conditions -- but Blair wants to show that Britain will play a positive role in Europe after years of rocky relations.</p>
<p>The deep splits within the Conservatives over Europe helped propel them to their humiliating defeat, which convinced Major he should step down as party leader.</p>
<p>The race to become new party leader was thrown wide open at the weekend when Michael Heseltine, one of the party's few remaining big guns, announced he would not be standing.</p>
<p>Former social security secretary Peter Lilley, a right-wing anti-European, put himself forward. John Redwood, another fierce opponent of further integration with Europe, was on the verge of announcing his candidature.</p>
<p>Former finance minister Kenneth Clarke is already standing and other possible candidates are former Welsh Secretary William Hague and former health secretary Stephen Dorrell.</p>
