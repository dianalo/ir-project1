<headline>Cricket-England uses video in attempt to foil tricky Warne.</headline>
<dateline>LEEDS, England 1997-05-19</dateline>

<p>England's cricketers plan to unravel the mysteries of Shane Warne's wrist spin by watching television over the next few days.</p>
<p>They are to view the latest slow motion video pictures of Warne as they prepare for their first confrontation of the season with the Australian leg break maestro.</p>
<p>England face Australia in a three-match limited overs series starting here at Headingley on Thursday, continuing at The Oval on Saturday and ending at Lord's on Sunday.</p>
<p>Coach David Lloyd has provided his England squad with video film of Warne in action during the touring team's one-day match against Worcestershire on Sunday.</p>
<p>Lloyd said on Monday: &quot;Video analysis is part of your armoury. All the other international coaches use them, too, and what we are all looking for is that extra 10 percent -- something that gives you an edge and might be the difference between winning and losing.</p>
<p>&quot;I was surprised, for instance, my use of video analysis and motivational techniques were last summer called gimmicks. It's only what the Australians do, and the South Africans and the West Indians,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Captain Mike Atherton's squad were also provided with their new cricket code, detailed in a 28-page England Players' Handbook, when they gathered in Leeds.</p>
<p>Included in the document are sections covering betting, punctuality, dressing room privacy and the need to promote cricket in a positive manner when dealing with the media.</p>
<p>Lloyd said: &quot;We as an England team, and representing English cricket, have a new corporate image and we wanted to take the players through the things they will now have to adhere to.</p>
<p>&quot;Clothing, for instance, is one of the things covered and we will be generally tightening up our act.&quot;</p>
