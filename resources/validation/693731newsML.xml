<headline>NZ dollar closes half a cent lower after RB easing.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1997-06-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>A late selling spurt saw the New Zealand dollar close half a cent lower on Friday on a day in which the Reserve Bank eased by a wider than expected 100 basis points.</p>
<p>Dealers said the Kiwi had now settled into a lower range of US$0.6780-0.6830 and upside was limited.</p>
<p>They said selling was widespread and trading was hectic in spurts.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market will definitely try and test the bands that (Reserve Bank Governor Don) Brash was referring to -- 50 points either side of their desired range,&quot; said Bankers Trust chief dealer Sean Brown.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is sitting right smack on an MCI at 777, two basis points above their extremity for September quarter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The RB said it wanted its MCI to average at 825 over the quarter but would tolerate the index to move 50 basis points either side of that.  </p>
<p>The kiwi closed at 5.00 p.m. (0500 GMT) at US$0.6809/16 against its 0.6872/79 opening while the Trade-Weighted Index finished at 66.79 from its 67.31 opening.  </p>
<p>Brown said the RB had been brave to ease by as much as it did but market sentiment would be to test on the downside.</p>
<p>The RB said it had eased because the economy had slowed quicker than expected and inflation pressures had subsided.</p>
<p>&quot;Given that the RBNZ is going to allow rates to come off by as much as they are going to allow in the second half of 1997, any test below 775 is going to meet quite strong rhetoric from the RB,&quot; Brown said.</p>
<p>Profit takers were prevalent as the MCI closed in on the bottom of its range.  </p>
<p>Key support at 0.6820 was broken late in the session with U.S. investment houses prominent amongst the sellers.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it's going to bounce. I don't think we will see it above 0.6820,&quot; a Wellington bank dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The way is now open to sub-68 cents,&quot; said a chief dealer.</p>
<p>He said the RB's bands were not set in concrete and until the bank came out and said something, markets would continue to test it.</p>
