<p>European Union leaders struggled on Tuesday to make headway on finalising a new treaty to modernise the 15-member bloc as it enters the next century and prepares to embrace new members from eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Flushed with heading off, for now, a potential crisis over monetary union on Monday, leaders at a two-day summit in the Dutch capital appeared bogged down over a number of key issues, such as raising the Union's profile on the global diplomatic stage and streamlining its joint decision-making processes.</p>
<p>Undeterred by, at best, a lukewarm response to a pledge to pay more attention to jobs and growth in the run-up to monetary union, the summit battled to overcome pockets of national resistance to proposed changes to the way the Union works.</p>
<p>Officials said there was wide agreement on the direction a new treaty should take, but large differences among the 15 partners on sensitive issues such as defence and power-sharing.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going very slowly,&quot; Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini told Reuters.</p>
<p>Asked what were the chances of a deal on a new treaty on Tuesday, he replied: &quot;A little better that 50:50 at the moment. There's still a very long way to go.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the latest draft treaty, drawn up by the Dutch EU presidency, EU countries would agree to cooperate more closely on asylum, immigration, visa policy and crime fighting, although Britain, Ireland and Denmark have been offered opt-outs.</p>
<p>The move to beef up cooperation on borders and immigration is part of the EU's plans to create an area of freedom, security and justice designed to appeal to a disenchanted populace.</p>
<p>Anticipating lengthy negotiations before any deal is struck, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told reporters: &quot;The European train remains on track and keeps on puffing.&quot; Officials said there were a number of other areas remaining, such as defence and flexibility -- the concept of allowing the bloc's keenest integrationists to move ahead without the others.</p>
<p>Britain, Denmark and the bloc's neutrals -- Sweden, Ireland, Finland and Austria -- have resisted calls for integration of the Western European Union (WEU) into the bloc, seen by the rest as a step torwards true integration.</p>
<p>An aide to British Prime Minister Tony Blair said: &quot;He is not going to allow anything to go through which he believes could be interpreted as undermining NATO.&quot;</p>
<p>Diplomats said one of the toughest fights would be over flexibility, where a number of countries want to retain a veto to prevent them from being left behind by eager integrationists.</p>
<p>On Monday, the leaders papered over a potentially disastrous dispute over the single currency by agreeing a resolution on employment to go with the stability pact, the framework for keeping budgets tight under economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>France and Germany had been sharply at odds over the issue, with the Socialist government in Paris demanding more attention on joblessness and less on fervent budgetary rigour.</p>
<p>Leftist French newspapers offered cautious praise for the deal, but right-wing dailies said the agreement was symbolic and would not immediately create jobs in France. Financial daily Les Echos called the compromise a &quot;face-saving&quot; gesture that allowed all parties to pull back from the brink of rejecting the stability pact.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reason for celebration,&quot; conservative daily Frankfurter Allgemeine said. &quot;The solution is just like most Brussels compromises: it is too thin to have any durability.&quot;</p>
<p>Conservative Austrian daily Die Presse wrote: &quot;The agreement between Germany and France (over jobs and growth) prevented the Amsterdam summit from becoming an embarrassing flop.&quot;</p>
<p>During a lunch break on Tuesday, the leaders took a stroll across a bridge over the River Amstel where the Mayor of Amsterdam presented them with bicycles, the favoured mode of transport in this pancake-flat land.</p>
<p>While German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Jacques Chirac declined to mount their new gifts, Dutch Premier Wim Kok, British Prime Minister Blair and Austrian Chancellor Victor Klima sped off.</p>
<p>The leaders will later return to discuss a two-speed Europe.</p>
