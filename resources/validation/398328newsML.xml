<p>Eurotunnel Plc/SA, the British-French operator of the tunnel under the English Channel, said Monday its bank lenders had no significant problems with its financial restructuring and it expected the details would be ironed out in time for a shareholder vote by the end of June.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no problems with the banks,&quot; a Eurotunnel spokeswoman said. Eurotunnel earlier said its bank syndicate had agreed to extend a suspension of payments on 70 billion francs ($12.4 billion) of junior debt to Dec. 14, 1997.</p>
<p>The company invoked the debt payment standstill in September 1995 and the freeze would have ended March 14 without the extension.</p>
<p>Co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said in January that he hoped to agree on the restructuring terms by March, in time to send documents to its 225-member bank syndicate.</p>
<p>&quot;Working parties are studying the details of the various financial instruments and fixing the parameters,&quot; the spokeswoman said. That included agreeing on the conditions for implementing the instruments, she said.</p>
<p>The payment suspension extension was not related to further bank negotiations but was due to a fire that seriously damaged part of the tunnel in November and disrupted operations.</p>
<p>The terms of the restructuring, which had been agreed in principle last October with steering committee banks, need to be concluded by the end of March so that a prospectus could be sent out in April to allow shareholders to vote on the complex package by June 30, the spokeswoman said.</p>
