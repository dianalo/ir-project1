<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel, the proposer of a European budget pact to cap public spending, on Friday said a finished budget deal was satifactory and brushed aside worries the pact fell short of Bonn's hopes.</p>
<p>European Union ministers earlier approved the outlines of a the so-called stability pact, which lays down sanctions and then fines for countries which exceed annual budget goals.</p>
<p>But the agreement fell short of Bonn's hopes in some important respects, most notably in defining the exceptional economic circumstances under which a country might be permitted to escape fines due to severe recession.</p>
<p>Waigel was nonetheless upbeat in his presentation of the final deal, stressing that the agreement still achieved his original goal of boosting credibility in the single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;I am satisfied,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;It was hard work but successful. It is an important step for the preparation of economic and monetary union and it is an important signal for the people and for the markets.&quot;</p>
<p>Countries which want to meld their currencies in the euro from 1999 must meet targets on interest and exchange rates, inflation, public debt and deficits next year. The stability pact is intended to ensure that this is not a one-off event.</p>
<p>Waigel added that the deal was further proof that the single European currency due to be created in 1999, would be a stable, hard currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The stability pact is a credible signal that the euro will be a hard currency,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the stability pact deal, countries which allow their budget deficit to exceed more than three percent of gross domestic product in a year will face an initial fine of 0.2 percent of GDP, rising to a maximum of 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>The fines were pitched lower than Germany's original proposals, which had a stronger deterrent value.</p>
<p>Bonn also made a second key concession to clinch a deal -- a relaxation of its demand that offending nations could only escape sanctions or fines on economic grounds if their economies shrank by at least two percent in a year.</p>
<p>The final agreement incorporated the two percent figure, but also gave countries whose economies shrank by just 0.75 percent in a year the chance to argue that this was an exceptional circumstance and talk their way out of a loan.</p>
<p>Yet Juergen Stark, state secretary to the finance ministry, played down the importance of the concessions in this area, saying that there would still be relatively few cases where a country could successfully argue its way out of sanctions.</p>
<p>He told Reuters that Bonn believed that, had the pact existed over the past 35 years, exemptions on economic ground would only have been granted to EU states in about 20 cases.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important to remember that not every case where an economy shrinks by 0.75 percent will be an exception,&quot; he added. &quot;The onus lies with the country itself to prove that thi was an exceptional circumstance.&quot;</p>
<p>Under its original proposal, Bonn had estimated that there would have been 13 exceptional cases.</p>
