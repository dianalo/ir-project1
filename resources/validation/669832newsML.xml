<p>Electrical and plastic goods manufacturer PDL Holdings Ltd has almost exhausted its growth potential in New Zealand and is focused on international expansion, executive director Neil Archer said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We've done New Zealand, so to speak. This is our home market and our profitable base, but the only way PDL as a company can do anything to grow is to go offshore,&quot; Archer told Reuters in an interview.  </p>
<p>PDL, which manufactures a myriad of goods ranging from industrial switchgear to shampoo bottles, already exports to over 40 countries. It is the fourth largest fan heater manufacturer in the world.</p>
<p>Archer said PDL would seek to grow established overseas markets and develop new ones through continued investment in research and development.</p>
<p>&quot;Our expansion has to be to take a group of products, normally industrial-based, that we design and make innovative, and then package and distribute in another market,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;You've got to go there with something that's got more margin in it because of the R&amp;D. The real growth for PDL is in its R&amp;D base.&quot;</p>
<p>An example was PDL's invention of a type of safety device known as an RCD (residual current device), which protects domestic and commercial users against electrocution.</p>
<p>&quot;The switch in that is patented worldwide by PDL. It's a very clever switch -- there's only one other company that's come close to us -- so we have a monopoly in the countries where we're selling this particular type of RCD,&quot; Archer said.  </p>
<p>He said PDL's RCD had gained a 60 percent market share in Britain since its introduction in 1993.</p>
<p>But the test bed for global growth was in Australia, where PDL Industries Australia Pty has just completed its first full year of trading.</p>
<p>&quot;It took us six to seven months to get it profitable, but it had a bottomline profit of $1 million last year and I believe we will have $1.5 million this year,&quot; Archer said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Australia is a tough market. If we can get the right package that works in Australia and use that as a testing ground, then we're going to use that successful formula and put it into other countries.&quot;</p>
<p>Archer said PDL had about five to six percent of the switch and socket market in Australia, but with only two other manufacturers to compete against a share in excess of 20 percent was not unrealistic.  </p>
<p>In Asia, the company was changing emphasis away from domestic market sectors to higher margin industrial switchgear, and rationalisation of existing business would be a major focus. But PDL's electronics division was targeting new markets in the United States, Latin America and Asia in the coming year</p>
<p>Archer said the group had not experienced any sales slippage in New Zealand as a result of the sluggish economy and expected to maintain the 10 percent earnings per share growth achieved in 1996/97 in the current financial year.  </p>
<p>&quot;I believe there will be some big jumps in PDL's earnings and prospects, but it's finding the right opportunity at the right time.</p>
<p>&quot;All big companies were little companies once -- we're on the way.&quot;</p>
<p>PDL reported a NZ$12.53 million net profit for the year to March 31. Archer said the company's bottomline result would tip $13 million this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Our full-year post-tax earnings will be around the $13 million mark,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>With wholesaler MasterTrade Group now fully owned by PDL there were no more New Zealand buys on the table, but offshore purchases were likely as the company pursued global growth.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be acquisitions that we need to make in the future offshore,&quot; Archer said.</p>
