<p>* Official list shares slip 1.92 points to 944.80 points.</p>
<p>* The broader group A index eased 1.61 points to 1824.46 points.</p>
<p>* Central market turnover dropped to 482,000 litas from 725,000 litas.</p>
<p>* Hermis Bank held steady at 215 litas and Vilniaus Bank was unchanged at 245 litas.</p>
<p>* Brokers say Hermis can stay liquid at current prices but Vilniaus Bank looks expensive.</p>
<p>Hermis Bank remained the only show in town on the central market of Lithuania's stock exchange on Wednesday, as major share indices closed slightly down and brokers said most prices would remain steady.</p>
<p>Official list shares slipped 1.92 points to 944.80 points, while the broader group A index eased 1.61 points to 1824.46 points.</p>
<p>&quot;I can evaluate the whole market trend as sideways, steady, or without any clear trends,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Hermis Bank remained steady and liquid at 215 litas on the central market, turning over 302,000 litas, compared to total central market turnover that dropped to a mere 482,000 litas from 725,000 litas.</p>
<p>&quot;I think at this price, I would assume the (Hermis) shares might stay active for another week,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Vilniaus Bank shares stayed steady but not very active at 245 litas on the central market, where they turned over only 10,000 litas.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that Vilniaus Bank, for the moment, is overpriced,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Rokishkis Cheese, defying the laws of market physics, eased to 41.50 litas from 42 litas amid a mere 4,150 litas turnover on the central market.</p>
<p>The company announced on Monday its profits for the first half of the year rose to a whopping 9.467 million litas from 1.253 million in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Brokers say the Lithuanian market is not quick to respond to results and that it will take time for Rokishkis shares to benefit from the company's profits.</p>
<p>&quot;Rokishkis will rise in two or three months,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Rokishkis also turned over 207,000 litas in block trades at prices between 41.30 litas and 41.40 litas.</p>
