<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told the Palestinian Authority he will stop the building of a Jewish settler enclave in the heart of Arab East Jerusalem &quot;at this time&quot;, a move welcomed by the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;As of now, the decision is not to let it go ahead and that is precisely what is going to happen,&quot; David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's communications chief, told Israel Radio on Friday.</p>
<p>He said Palestinian President Yasser Arafat had received the assurance on Thursday night in a telephone call from a senior Netanyahu aide, Yitzhak Molho, and &quot;was quite pleased to hear the explanation&quot;.</p>
<p>Palestinian official Nabil Shaath confirmed that Israel had contacted Arafat but did not elaborate. &quot;A contact was made but I can't confirm who made it.&quot;</p>
<p>A project by American Jewish magnate Irving Moskowitz to build a few dozen houses in the 11,000-strong Arab neighbourhood of Ras al-Amoud was given the green light by the Israeli Jerusalem municipality on Thursday night.</p>
<p>The surprise move outraged Palestinian officials, who warned that construction could ignite Arab-Israeli violence anew.</p>
<p>Bar-Illan said Netanyahu did not contest Moskowitz's right to build on the plot under Israeli law but questioned the advisability of doing so &quot;at this time, and I stress, at this time&quot;.</p>
<p>Arafat's adviser, Ahmed Tibi, branded the project a &quot;declaration of war&quot; in the wake of a fiercely disputed Jewish home-building project close to East Jerusalem, as well as a violation of interim peace deals signed by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation since 1993.</p>
<p>Palestinian Finance Minister Mohammed al-Nashashibi said the Palestinian Authority would &quot;resist with all its possible means in order to prevent the continuation of settlements&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The implementation of it (Ras al-Amoud) will end the peace process,&quot; Nashashibi said after the weekly Palestinian cabinet meeting on Friday night in Gaza.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's peace talks with the PLO have been in crisis since March when Israel broke ground on the Har Homa settlement on a hilltop known to Palestinians as Jabal Abu Ghneim, on the edge of East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Arafat has insisted that work there must stop before substantive negotiations can resume.</p>
<p>Bar-Illan said Netanyahu believed the time was not right to build at Ras al-Amoud given that the project was in the midst of a densely-populated Arab neighbourhood and given the state of peace negotiations.</p>
<p>He said there was no question of a similar freeze at Har Homa. &quot;It's a barren hill, it's near two Jewish neighbourhoods and it is not in anyone's way,&quot; Bar-Illan told Reuters.</p>
<p>The United States said on Friday that Netanyahu's opposition to building Ras al-Amoud was a positive step and appealed for a resumption of the stalled Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a time for calm and it's a time mostly to return to the negotiating table and we think that the fact that the prime minister says he opposes this (new building project) is a positive step,&quot; said U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley.</p>
<p>The status of East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East War, is one of the most volatile issues dividing Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
<p>The PLO wants East Jerusalem as capital of a future Palestinian state and says Israeli moves to populate the area are aimed at pre-empting talks on the city's fate. Israel says both sides of the city form its &quot;united and eternal&quot; capital.</p>
<p>Israel's Jerusalem municipal planning commission gave conditional approval last December to a plan for 132 settler homes on a 3.5-acre (1.4-hectare) plot at Ras al-Amoud, which overlooks the walled Old City of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The plan required the approval of Interior Minister Eli Suissa but was later shelved.</p>
<p>Mayor Ehud Olmert, a member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud bloc, said the plan approved on Thursday was for a scaled-down project.</p>
<p>He said he doubted that Moskowitz, a Miami-based businessman who bankrolls Jewish settlement in occupied areas, would go ahead with the scheme as approved because the American, who had threatened legal action, would fight for the bigger project.</p>
<p>The United States has been playing a mediating role in the peace process and earlier this week Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she was hopeful of progress soon in the negotiations.</p>
