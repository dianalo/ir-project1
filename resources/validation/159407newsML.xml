<p>Shaun Pollock's chances of representing South Africa in India next month were given a boost on Thursday when he was included in the Natal side to play against Border in the four-day Supersport Series cricket match starting at Kingsmead on Friday.</p>
<p>The fast bowler, who has been recovering after an operation on his left ankle in August, proved his fitness in practice sessions at Kingsmead on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;He woke up this morning with no side effects after yesterday's workout and bowled without any discomfort again today,&quot; Natal coach Graham Ford told Reuters. </p>
<p>&quot;He's still not ready to charge in and bowl flat out and we'll be using him as a support bowler against Border.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously it's a decision which we have taken very seriously - both from a Natal and a South African point of view. Shaun wanted to prove his fitness for India but he was also concerned that he would be able to do his fair share of bowling for us over four days this weekend.&quot;</p>
<p>By playing in the match against Border, Pollock is now in line for possible selection to the South African side which will take on India in the three-test series during November and December.</p>
<p>The South African selectors meet in Durban on November 4 to announce possible changes to the national squad currently contesting the triangular series with India and Australia in India.</p>
<p>Convener of selectors Peter Pollock told Reuters that his selection team would be monitoring the round of four-day matches in Cape Town, Durban and Paarl from November 1-4 to assess the fitness of the likes of Pollock and Brett Schultz.</p>
<p>&quot;The guys who have fitness question marks must prove their fitness during those matches. And, if they don't play because of injury, then they can't be considered for India,&quot; Pollock said.</p>
