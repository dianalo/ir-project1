<headline>PolyGram H1 net falls, sales rise.</headline>

<p>Music and entertainment group PolyGram NV said on Tuesday first-half 1997 net profit slipped slightly, with music performing strongly but again offset by losses from its young film business.</p>
<p>Net profit in the first six months of 1997 declined to 270 million guilders ($132.9 million) from 272 million, returning to the level reported for the first half of 1995.</p>
<p>Analysts had been anticipating a net profit of as much as 286 million guilders, based on strong music sales from artists such as U2 and Hanson, with consensus seen at 276 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Compared with a strong first half of 1996, PolyGram's 1997 performance in film has been relatively weak to date,&quot; PolyGram chief executive Alain Levy said in a statement with the results.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result, income from operations was 430 million guilders for the first half of 1997, an increase of two percent over last year,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>First-half group sales climbed five percent to 4.53 billion guilders with music generating sales of 3.94 billion.</p>
<p>Operating profit in music rose to 522 million guilders from 457 million during the half. Veteran Irish rockers U2 sold over five million albums, while teenage newcomers Hanson sold three million.</p>
<p>The film division saw first-half turnover dip to 589 million guilders from 681 million with operating losses widening to 92 million from 37 million. Film's second-quarter operating loss was 37 million guilders compared to 55 million in the first quarter and 18 million in the second quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>PolyGram said the results of its filmed entertainment business reflected the division's lighter release schedule during the first six months of 1997, adding the division saw its strongest releases in the second half.</p>
<p>Film during the first half of 1996 benefited from the success of &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, &quot;Fargo&quot;, and &quot;Mr Holland's Opus&quot;.</p>
<p>At the first-quarter stage in April PolyGram said underperformance of previously released films &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; and &quot;Gridlock'd&quot; had hit its earnings.</p>
<p>PolyGram shares were up 5.10 guilders to 106.10 on a sharply higher Amsterdam bourse, roughly doubling gains posted ahead of the results.</p>
