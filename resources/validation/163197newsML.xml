<p>Toronto stocks posted their 51st record close of 1996 on Monday, powered by a rally in interest-sensitive issues ahead of an expected cut in Canadian interest rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;(The) market is looking for yet another Bank of Canada cut,&quot; said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie.</p>
<p>Canada's central bank has dropped short-term interest rates 19 times since May 1995, slashing the key bank rate by 4.75 percent to stimulate a lackluster economy.</p>
<p>&quot;If there's another Bank of Canada cut, the bank stocks will continue rallying,&quot; Beattie said.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index gained 17.95 points to close at 5609.26 points, reaching its 51st record close of 1996.</p>
<p>However, the overall market was mixed despite the rally in bank stocks. Declining issues outnumbered advances 478 to 447 with 300 issues unchanged.</p>
<p>A total of 88.7 million shares were traded worth C$1.28 billion (US$958 million) at Canada's largest stock exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is still looking at low interest rates and wondering where to put their money. They jump on the bandwagon of recent movements,&quot; said Ron Meisels, president of P &amp; C Holdings Ltd.</p>
<p>The financial services sector extended its long rally, adding more than two percent on Monday. The group led half of Toronto's 14 sub-indices higher.</p>
<p>Other strong sectors included real estate and utilities. Base metals, conglomerates and communications led the weak side.</p>
<p>Among hot stocks, Edper Group Ltd. receipts soared C$7.50 to close at C$78.50 on 4.2 million shares amid market speculation that talks over the World Financial Center in New York would soon conclude, leaving majority shareholders' Bronfman group in clear control.</p>
<p>* Bank of Montreal jumped C$1.10 to C$42.70, while National Bank of Canada rose C$0.40 to C$13.65.</p>
<p>* Air Canada shares gained C$0.45 to close at C$5.80 as investors appeared to shun troubled Canadian Airlines Corp. in favor of Canada's largest air carrier.</p>
<p>* Canadian Airlines fell C$0.36 to C$1.25 today after announcing a four-year C$800 million (US$599 million) restructuring plan on Friday.</p>
