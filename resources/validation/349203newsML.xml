<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on Friday he would not demand that Peru apologise for provocative police tactics aimed at unnerving Marxist rebels holding 72 hostgages in the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima.</p>
<p>Hashimoto also warned the rebels not to lose their temper and harm the hostages, a move that could prompt Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori to use force to end the 45-day hostage crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;Japan will never demand an apology from the Peruvian government, which has been making utmost efforts to secure the safe release of all hostages,&quot; Hashimoto told reporters travelling with him on his two-day trip to Toronto.</p>
<p>Hashimoto made the remarks shortly before arriving in Toronto for a crisis meeting on Saturday with Peru's Fujimori.</p>
<p>Peruvian police in recent days have repeatedly blasted martial music, sirens and the roar of aircraft at the siege site in an apparent ploy to wear down the rebels.</p>
<p>However, the tactic has also unnerved Japan, which fears the guerrillas may lose patience and take their anger out on the hostages.</p>
<p>Hashimoto earlier this week asked Fujimori to exercise caution when deploying police at the site to prevent &quot;accidents or incidents.&quot;</p>
<p>A Peruvian government source in Lima said Fujimori would not apologise for the police movements or seek approval for a military assault on the building.</p>
<p>Hashimoto voiced fear that the crisis could end up in bloodshed if the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) did harm to the hostages.</p>
<p>&quot;If the terrorists harmed the hostages, the situation would completely change,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;President Fujimori's position is very clear,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Hashimoto said he would urge Fujimori to move ahead and open direct negotiations with the rebels through an already-established guarantor commission for the safe release of the hostages.</p>
<p>&quot;Because the guarantor commission was formed, I would like to frankly ask President Fujimori to open a dialogue with the rebels as soon as possible,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think starting a dialogue means giving in to terrorism,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Though both the Peruvian government and the rebels voiced willingness to sit down to discuss a peaceful end to the crisis, Fujimori ruled out starting talks until the rebels drop their demand for the release of about 400 jailed comrades.</p>
<p>The rebels have said there is no point in talking unless that demand is on the agenda.</p>
<p>A Japanese government source said Japan and Peru were united against terrorism, but divided over whether the time had come to give some ground on the rebels' main demand.</p>
<p>The source said the Peruvian government should include the rebels' main demand on the agenda. &quot;But that doesn't mean that the imprisoned MRTA guerrillas will be freed,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>Shortly before leaving for Toronto on Thursday, Fujimori said in Lima that the meeting was aimed at achieving &quot;a very close coordination.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If we were in an emergency situation we would need to be in close contact,&quot; Fujimori said in an interview with Argentina's CVN television network.</p>
<p>The MRTA rebels originally seized hundreds of guests when they stormed the Japnnese ambassador's residence on Dec. 17 during a diplomatic reception. They released most of the captives, but kept those they consider the most important bargaining chips.</p>
