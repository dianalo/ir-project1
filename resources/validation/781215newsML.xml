<p>--------------------MARKET COMMENT-------------------------</p>
<p>* Toronto stocks continued their record-setting rally on Wednesday * Banks, energy, transport groups powered TSE to 33rd record close of 1997 * More than 88 million shares traded  </p>
<p>Toronto stocks extended their winning streak on Wednesday, as bank stocks fueled record gains on Canada's biggest stock market.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Composite Index climbed 30.62 points to finish at 6933.70, its 33rd record lose of the year.</p>
<p>The key index also set an intraday peak of 6941.81.</p>
<p>Almost 89 million shares were traded worth C$1.63 billion.</p>
<p>The financial services group tacked on 141 points, leading nine of 14 sub-groups higher.</p>
<p>Analysts said the lofty equity prices had not deterred investors from pouring more cash into the market.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think there are people out there who have not yet completed their stock ownership and they are being induced by the market action to participate,&quot; said Ron Meisels, president of P and C Holdings Ltd in Montreal.</p>
<p>Royal Bank of Canada sparked the rally in bank shares after U.S. brokerage Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral. Royal closed up 1.60 at 67.60.</p>
<p>Other top groups included communications, gold and precious metals, energy and transportation. There were modest losses in industrial products and pipelines.</p>
<p>--- HOT STOCKS ---</p>
<p>* Among other bank stocks, Bank of Nova Scotia soared 2.25 to 67.95, a 52-week high. Bank of Montreal added 0.90 to 58.35, just off a 52-week high of 58.55.</p>
<p>* Laurentian Bank gained 0.20 to 28.60 after the sale of its Nassau subsidiary to Banque Nationale de Paris S.A.</p>
<p>* Newbridge Networks Corp led heavy traders, sinking 5.10 to 64.55 on 2.7 million shares after it said late on Tuesday that its upcoming first-quarter results would fall short of analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>* Artisan Corp rose 0.90 to 14.50, a 52-week high, after reporting sharply higher second-quarter earnings.</p>
