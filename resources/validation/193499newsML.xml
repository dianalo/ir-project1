<p>The newly appointed global chief executive of WPP Plc's J. Walter Thompson Worldwide agency, Chris Jones, said that one of his first jobs will be to explore combining some of the global media buying operations of the world's largest advertising holding company, WPP.</p>
<p>&quot;We've conducted a worldwide (study), which has been just reported to the (Thompson) board, and we will be proposing some changes going forward,&quot; he said in an interview Friday.</p>
<p>Jones said he would not elaborate on those changes and would not make any specific comment on industry reports that WPP is considering combining media operations of its two main agency networks, J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather.</p>
<p>In what could be a blueprint for broader cooperation, the agencies are bidding together for the Canadian agency, Media Buying Services Ltd. Recently, Ogilvy and Thompson combined some of their media assets to service a shared client, Eastman Kodak, in another sign of where the business is headed.</p>
<p>Jones said the object of combining media forces would be to improve the effectiveness of the media buying operations for the WPP units, but not necessarily to cut costs.  </p>
<p>Media buyers often say that pooling funds can add to their clout when they  buy commercial space from major media conglomerates.</p>
<p>&quot;If we want to claim leadership as a global agency, then we have to be as good as the best in media,&quot; Jones said.</p>
<p>Improving the agency's creative work is also a &quot;main commitment&quot; on Jones's agenda as he takes over. He noted that bonus schemes are being installed that will reward creative staff based on how much improvement is brought to their commercial work.</p>
<p>&quot;We've invested millions of dollars on proprietary research in this area, in understanding how people communicate given all of their multimedia choices,&quot; Jones said.</p>
<p>Jones sees continuing growth for J. Walter Thompson as clients consolidate their global advertising with a single agency.</p>
<p>Thompson has built up its Latin American and Asian networks, which have experienced rapid growth in recent years. Bigger growth will also be seen in Europe in the year ahead, Jones said, citing the addition of the Mazda account in Europe.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of stuff on the table right now in terms of growth potential,&quot; Jones said, citing a record of five years of record billings and revenue growth for the Thompson agency, with global billings of nearly $7 billion. &quot;We're going to have a very good year in '97.&quot;</p>
<p>J. Walter Thompson Worldwide said that Chris Jones has been named chief executive officer, from January 1.</p>
<p>Jones will succeed Burt Manning, who will remain chairman of the advertising agency. Previously, Jones was co-president, a position he shared with Peter Schweitzer, who will remain president of the global agency.</p>
