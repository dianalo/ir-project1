<headline>German debt and futures seek strength to move up.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-07-16</dateline>

<p>German Bunds and futures were slightly higher in late dealings on Wednesday as fresh buy orders continued flowing into the market but not enough to break the market out of choppy range trade.</p>
<p>At 1445 GMT, DTB September Bund futures were up 14 basis points at 102.42 but off the session high of 102.61 reached on help from gains in U.S. debt prices tied to fresh U.S. economic data showing inflation may be contained for the rest of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still buyers in the market but not enough to really push the market higher. People are nervous about the mark and what the Bundesbank will do,&quot; said one dealer.  </p>
<p>Dealers looked for September Bund futures to turn to a consolidative tone in the near-term and to underperform the U.S. market, with resistance pegged at 102.53 and crucial support evident at 102.17 ahead of 102.00.</p>
<p>Although the long-end of the market did not appear to be overbought anymore, they said the dollar concerns would keep the market from posting further gains but would be helped by a steep depreciation in the short-end due to rate hike fears.</p>
<p>But economists still regard a rate rise in the near-term as unlikely given the absence of inflationary pressures and the weakness of consumer demand and domestic investment.  </p>
<p>Some traders said market remained focused on speculation that the Bundesbank may opt to raise interest rates before the end of the year to help trim the dollar's surge.</p>
<p>The dollar was trading near 1.80 marks, shrugging off a statement from the Bonn government that it saw no reason to dramatise the recent developments in foreign exchange markets.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not rule out the Bundesbank raising rates before the end of the year as one option,&quot; said a Frankfurt trader.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a question of how high they will allow the dollar to rise. But Germany's economic data is not good enough to justify a rate rise,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Market attention on Thursday will focus on currency market movements along with the release of U.S. weekly jobless claims at 1230 GMT and the Philadelphia Fed Survey at 1400 GMT.</p>
