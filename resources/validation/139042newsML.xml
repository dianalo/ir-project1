<p>Michael Moorer insists that he only has eyes for Francois Botha, but it's hard to believe he will not be sneaking a peak past the South African to a potential megabucks bout with Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not underestimating him, and I'm not looking past him,&quot; Moorer said of Botha in a teleconference call from his training camp outside Los Angeles on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to go in and conqueror this guy,&quot; Moorer said of the unbeaten challenger he will fight November 9 in defence of his International Boxing Federation heavyweight crown.</p>
<p>Moorer and Botha will mix it up in Las Vegas on the undercard of the Tyson-Evander Holyfield World Boxing Association title fight.</p>
<p>If Moorer (31-7) defeats the 36-0 Botha and Tyson wins his bout, the two will likely meet to to unify their titles next March in a fight that stands to make Moorer a very rich man.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a big fight regardless of what is in the future, because I am defending my title,&quot; said Moorer, trying not to be drawn into any Tyson speculation. &quot;My thing is to focus on this, achieve this and move on.&quot;</p>
<p>To make sure of that, Moorer has been constantly reminded by trainer Teddy Atlas of the danger presented by Botha.</p>
<p>&quot;I set the standard right from the beginning of camp that the only thing to concentrate on is Botha,&quot; Atlas said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want him in any way taking him lightly, because I think he is much better fighter than people give him credit for,&quot; Atlas said of the South African.</p>
<p>&quot;He throws a lot of punches and in his own awkward way they are clever punches,&quot; Atlas said. &quot;He is not a huge puncher. He throws sneaky punches from weird angles.&quot;</p>
<p>Botha briefly held the IBF title after beating German Axel Schulz for the vacant crown in December of 1996. But he was stripped of the title after testing positive for steroids.</p>
<p>Moorer and Schulz fought for the title on June 22, with the American winning by decision.</p>
<p>Much like Tyson since his comeback, Botha has been criticised for the quality of his opponents. Atlas said that was no cause for comfort.</p>
<p>&quot;When you have an undefeated record with no recognisable names it is human nature to wrinkle a eye and figure it is a built up record, but this guy is a real fighter,&quot; Atlas said.</p>
<p>In discussing his fighter's game plan, Atlas might just as have well been describing the man he refused to talk about -- Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>&quot;You are going to see a much more aggressive, ferocious, vicious kind of guy on November 9,&quot; Atlas said. &quot;I guarantee that.&quot;</p>
