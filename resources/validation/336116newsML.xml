<p>BELFAST, Jan 27 (Reuter)) - In a small room near Belfast, a fanatic reared on cider and the Sex Pistols is assembling Northern Ireland's latest explosive device.</p>
<p>The target is a province at war with itself for nearly 30 years. The warhead is black humour. And the effect, say respected international authorites, is devastating.</p>
<p>Meet literary terrorist Colin Bateman, a 34-year-old writer with three wildly funny and fast-selling books behind him, two more in the works and two feature films in the offing.</p>
<p>The background to his work is Northern Ireland's 27-year conflict between pro-Irish Catholics and pro-British Protestants. The &quot;Troubles&quot; have killed 3,200 and created a unique black humour on the province's battered streets.</p>
<p>The Sunday Times said of &quot;Divorcing Jack,&quot; his 1995 first novel: &quot;As sharp as a pint of snakebite...manages to say more about the Troubles in 280 vivid pages than reams of earnest reportage ever could.&quot;</p>
<p>It is a typically crazy Bateman plot: journalist Dan Starkey and his wife Patricia love alcohol a lot but their partnership is strained. Then Dan kisses a beautiful young student, Margaret at a party. She gets murdered, his wife gets kidnapped.</p>
<p>AS SHARP AS SNAKEBITE</p>
<p>The rest is mayhem. The cast includes a smooth, self-styled middle-of-the-road politician called Brinn and thugs of both Protestant and Catholic persuasions with names like Cow Pat Coogan and Mad Dog.</p>
<p>No-one is spared Bateman's satire. He uses humour to debunk the pompous and the pretentious but most of all to ridicule the bigots whose attitudes hold the province a hostage to war.</p>
<p>The Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Catholic-backed guerrilla force fighting to end British rule, and its Protestant Loyalist adversaries, such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), are set up and then demolished.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry to hear that three IRA men died earlier today,&quot; says one character in Divorcing Jack. &quot;Their car left the road and hit a tree. The UVF said they planted it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cycle of Violence,&quot; his second novel, is set in a border village called Crossmaheart to which a young journalist known only as Miller is sent from to replace a reporter who has disappeared. Lots of people disappear here, the reader learns.</p>
<p>Miller has no driving licence because of a drunk-driving offence. &quot;His bike was known in the newsroom as the Cycle of Violence. When Miller fell into a drinking spree and failed to return, the bike was known as the Endless Cycle of Violence.&quot;</p>
<p>Bateman's literary training ground was the so-called Gold Coast of Northern Ireland, a seaside strip outside Belfast which is home to some of the province's wealthier Protestants.</p>
<p>He worked from the age of 17 as a junior reporter, &quot;doing everything,&quot; on the County Down Spectator, a small weekly paper, of which he was deputy editor until about six months ago.</p>
<p>    NEVER MIND THE B...........</p>
<p>The defining moment which transformed him from newspaperman to novelist was the banning in the United Kingdom of an album by Britain's foul-mouthed punk rock pioneers the Sex Pistols.</p>
<p>The album was called &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks.&quot; Six months after its banning, it started to appear in record shops as soon as the initial row over its title had faded.</p>
<p>Bateman wrote a column about the album's re-emergence. It was headlined &quot;Never Mind the B.......&quot; The offending word was</p>
<p>not spelled out in deference to the newspaper's middle class, Protestant readership.</p>
<p>But his editor, &quot;a prim, school-mistress, Sunday School teacher type called Annie Raycroft asked me what the headline meant,&quot; says Bateman. &quot;I told her why I couldn't use the full word. She told me I could,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;That unchained me. From that moment on I started writing a column. I wrote anything that came into my head. Satire was too good a word for it. I was just taking the piss,&quot; Bateman said.</p>
<p>&quot;I was a cider-swilling punk rocker. Once I wrote that I had been to the United States to buy weapons for the Boys Brigade and that they were going to have paramilitary coffee mornings with armalites in one hand, jaffa cakes in the other. There were three libel actions against the paper for that one.....&quot;</p>
<p>ENDLESS CYCLE OF VIOLENCE</p>
<p>He began writing books. He hasn't stopped. Divorcing Jack was refused by every small publishing house so he sent it to a big one, Harper Collins. It sent &quot;a very bad photocopy&quot; to the panel of London's Betty Trask prize for first novels. It won.</p>
<p>&quot;Of Wee Sweetie Mice and Men,&quot; his third book, stars a no-hope Protestant boxer, his Catholic wife, his opponent for the world title Mike Tyson, promoter Don King, the IRA, the UVF and a fanatical Moslem group called the Sons of Mohammed.</p>
<p>Bateman is in Belfast, watching the filming of a television sreenplay he has written called &quot;Jumpers.&quot; &quot;It's about three people who meet on the window ledge where they are about to commit suicide. One of them is Father Christmas.&quot;</p>
<p>It is a typically grim, dank Belfast day. Police in flak jackets carrying automatic rifles are patrolling the streets outside the office where the film is being made. Shoppers are hurrying from the New Year sales under umbrellas.</p>
<p>The scene feels like the opening paragraph of Bateman's third book. &quot;Peace had settled over the city like the skin on a rancid custard. Everbody wanted it, just not in that form. The forecast remained for rain, with widespread terrorism.&quot;</p>
