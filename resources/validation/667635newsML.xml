<headline>France calls for more peace efforts in Congo.</headline>

<p>France, pulling out its troops from strife-torn Brazzaville, on Tuesday urged African mediators to keep up efforts to restore peace and asked the warring parties in Congo to agree to a ceasefire and discuss peace.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry said President Pascal Lissouba and former military leader Denis Sassou Nguyesso would bear a heavy responsibility to their people if they failed to hold a dialogue.</p>
<p>An international mediation committee led by Gabon's veteran president, Omar Bongo, has failed to achieve a breakthrough. But it vowed to carry on trying to end a 12-day-old bloody power struggle that has devastated the capital of the Congo Republic.</p>
<p>&quot;We very strongly encourage this committee to pursue any new initiative that could bring about a rapprochement between the Congolese parties. Civil peace will return only if they display a spirit of dialogue and compromise,&quot; the French ministry said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Congolese parties must urgently implement a real ceasefire, as they had pledged to on June 12, in order to end the suffering of the civilian population.&quot;</p>
<p>The mediators have been unable to find enough common ground for dialogue and did not make clear whether fresh talks would be held. They also called for an immediate ceasefire.</p>
<p>The French ministry said Paris would keep on doing all it could to bring about dialogue and peace. But it made no mention of a call from Lissouba for French troops to take part in an international buffer force.</p>
<p>Small-arms fire continued on Tuesday in the Congolese capital where hundreds, if not thousands of people have been killed.</p>
<p>Signalling it would not take sides in the fighting in its former colony, France began pulling out its troops on Monday. The troops, who went to Brazzaville on standby to evacuate foreign nationals from Kinshasa, the capital of former Zaire across the river, have evacuated 5,719 foreign nationals.</p>
<p>The ministry said that, once peace is restored, all efforts by Congolose and the international community should be applied to holding a presidential election scheduled for July 27.</p>
<p>Lissouba said on Tuesday that the election was threatened by the fighting and could only go ahead as scheduled if an international force separated the warring factions.</p>
<p>Sassou Nguesso ran the country from 1979 to 1992, when Lissouba defeated him in multi-party elections.</p>
