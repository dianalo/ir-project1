<p>A jury trial of the former owner of movie studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., Giancarlo Parretti, for alleged perjury and evidence tampering is scheduled to begin Monday.</p>
<p>Parretti is charged with having forged a facsimile used as evidence in a highly publicised state chancery court trial over Parretti's ousting as studio chief.</p>
<p>If convicted, he faces a maximum total sentence of 10 years.</p>
<p>Parretti has pleaded innocent to the perjury charges. His attorney could not be reached for comment Friday.</p>
<p>Last year the Italian financier returned voluntarily to Delaware to face the charges and was granted bail.</p>
<p>He has since been living in California, pursuing a $3.9 billion lawsuit against Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV, a Dutch affiliate of France's state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais, for allegedly conspiring to take MGM away from him.</p>
<p>That case is set for trial in March in the California Superior Court in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In the 1991 Chancery Court trial, which formed the basis of the current perjury charges, the court ruled that Credit Lyonnais, which financed Parretti's $1.3 billion purchase of MGM from Kirk Kerkorian in 1990, had the right to oust him as head of the movie studio.</p>
<p>The decision was based in part on the bank's allegation that Parretti failed to disclose a potential $150 million obligation of MGM to repurchase certain movie rights.</p>
<p>The fax allegedly forged by Parretti was presented to support his claim that he had received certain information from the bank related to the purchase of MGM.</p>
<p>As he faces trial, Parretti also is seeking to reopen the original chancery court case to include a key witness's recanting of his testimony against Parretti.</p>
<p>His attorney, Lawrence Drexler said, &quot;We are not yet asking the court to reverse its judgment, but first want to fully develop the record... Had the Court had all these newly disclosed facts available to it, we think there would have been a different outcome (in 1991).&quot;</p>
<p>In an affidavit taken in Italy last month and obtained by Reuters, Parretti's former partner, Florio Fiorini, recanted his 1991 testimony supporting the bank's position that Parretti knew of the repurchase liability.</p>
<p>Fiorini now alleges he was pressured by Credit Lyonnais to testify against Parretti in exchange for a bank loan to shore up his failing company, Sasea. Credit Lyonnais attorneys did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p>In a 1992 auction, Credit Lyonnais bought MGM's assets and recently sold them for $1.3 billion to a group backed by Kirk Kerkorian.</p>
