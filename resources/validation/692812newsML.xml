<p>The Indian rupee moved in a narrow band to end Friday steady at 35.82/83 against the dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>The day was dominated by State Bank of India (SBI) which came in successive waves to mop up an estimated $100 million, they said.</p>
<p>SBI began buying at 35.830 and stepped up its bids to 35.835 in a second round. &quot;Thereafter banks went and sold to SBI at 35.830,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>SBI came around again to buy at 35.835 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;After this, he was comfortably placed and started bidding down,&quot; the chief dealer at a Bombay bank said about SBI.</p>
<p>The rupee continued its climb against the forward dollar, propelled by exporter sales and signals from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>Premiums fluctuated during the day on intra-day profit-booking. The six month annualised forward premium closed the day at 3.46 percent compared with the previous close of 3.79 percent.</p>
<p>Exporters were seen selling far forwards to get premiums above 4.0 percent, dealers said.</p>
