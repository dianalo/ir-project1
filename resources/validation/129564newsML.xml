<p>The market's fruitless search for direction last week is likely to be satisfied by the release of three economic indicators this week -- CPI, money supply and trade account data.</p>
<p>Consumer inflation is expected to have risen above the eight percent mark in September mainly as a result of rising food prices and technical factors, economists said at the weekend.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters poll of 12 economists, the September consumer price index will rise 8.1 percent year-on-year or 0.7 percent month-on-month after rising 7.5 percent and 0.7 percent in August.</p>
<p>The consensus was drawn from a range of 7.9 to 8.2 percent.</p>
<p>Economists said the main concern in the latest data would be rising food prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Compared to this time last year, we have not received any rain yet and we have just had a cold winter,&quot; said Huysamer Stals chief economist Johan Rossouw. &quot;Food prices have picked up significantly in the previous month and I can't see any reason for that to change.&quot;</p>
<p>Meat prices in particular are expected to have risen sharply in the build up to the Christmas season.</p>
<p>Food prices contributed the bulk of August's increase with a 1.7 percent contribution, while the index excluding food rose just 0.2 percent from July.</p>
<p>Sanlam chief economist Pieter Calitz also noted another reason for higher inflation in September would be the fact that the latest figures would come off a low base. CPI rose just 0.1 percent month-on-month in September last year.</p>
<p>Economists also expected the quarterly survey of furniture, medical and photographic prices to contribute to the month-on-month rise.</p>
<p>The data will be released at 0900 GMT on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Money supply and private sector credit extension data is also due for release this week.</p>
<p>Economists forecast M3 would grow at a slower rate of 15.1 percent in September compared with a preliminary 15.51 percent in August. The average was drawn from a range of 14.4 percent to 15.8 percent.</p>
<p>Equisec economist Dawie Roodt said one of the main reasons money supply would ease was the fact that the data would be calculated off a high base.</p>
<p>M3 rose 1.5 percent month-on-month in September a year ago.</p>
<p>Frankel Pollak gilts analyst Tertia Jacobs was more optimistic that a build up in government deposits during the month would have drawn money out of the equation, resulting in a much slower money supply growth rate.</p>
<p>Private sector credit extension was expected to ease to 17.3 from 17.71 percent in August.</p>
<p>Economists said the main reason for the slowdown in credit extension would be the reduction in new car sales in September.</p>
<p>South African new car sales fell 2.4 percent to 19,928 units in September from 20,420 units in August and eased 9.5 percent from the 22,029 units sold in September 1995.</p>
<p>High interest rates were also expected to have taken their toll on consumers' borrowing capacity, while a high base in the same month a year ago was also expected to help.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank has scheduled the data for release on Friday at 1500 GMT.</p>
<p>Trade data, which the South African Revenue Services said would be released from Wednesday onwards, drew predictions of a consensus forecast of a 720 million rand surplus compared with a 130 million rand surplus in August.</p>
<p>However, half of the economists polled were reluctant to predict the figure which they describe as too volatile and notoriously erratic.</p>
<p>The consensus was drawn from a range of 500 million rand to one billion rand.</p>
<p>Calitz said his forecast was based on general expectations that import volumes were expected to decline as a result of the weaker rand, which would in turn boost the value of South Africa's exports.</p>
