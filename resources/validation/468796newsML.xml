<p>Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila flew to the eastern city of Goma on Wednesday and a rebel spokesman rejected sharing power with ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko's political party.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Kabila arrived in Goma by plane from the northeastern Zairean capital of Kisangani and was driven to his lakeside residence in this city bordering on Rwanda with a heavy rebel escort.</p>
<p>An official with the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation Congo-Zaire told Reuters Kabila had business in Goma before going to another location for a meeting.</p>
<p>He said Kabila would return to Kisangani in three days and he did not know where the rebel chief would go after Goma.</p>
<p>A rebel delegation was in Lome, Togo, on Wednesday for an Organisation of Africa Unity summit on the Zaire crisis. Kabila and President Mobutu Sese Seko had not been expected in Togo.</p>
<p>Kabila arrived in Kisangani last Saturday, a week after it was captured. Its fall was the biggest prize so far for AFDL, which has seized about a quarter of Africa's third largest country since October.</p>
<p>Asked about a proposal made on Tuesday by Mobutu's Popular Revolutionary Movement (MPR) for it and the AFDL to share power before elections, rebel information commissioner Raphael Nghenda said:</p>
<p>&quot;There cannot be power-sharing between us and Mobutu's people. It is impossible.&quot;</p>
<p>Rebel officials said their delegation in Lome would explain the rebel position on Zaire at Wednesday's Organisation of African Unity summit but would not negotiate with a delegation sent by Mobutu.</p>
<p>A rebel delegation could in future hold talks with envoys of Mobutu to prepare for a summit between Mobutu and Kabila, rebel justice commissioner Mwanze Kongolo said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said South Africa was the ideal but not the only location for a meeting and he hoped preparatory talks would start soon.</p>
<p>In Lome, Bizima Karaha, Kabila's chief foreign policy strategist and a leader of the rebel team at Wednesday's meeting, also rejected power-sharing but said he believed negotiations might start soon.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall never, never enter into any power-sharing with the government in Kinshasa. One thing for sure, we are not fighting for power-sharing,&quot; he told British Broadcasting Corporation radio.</p>
