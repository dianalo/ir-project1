<title>UK: IPE Brent rebounds, ignoring U.S. inventory data.</title>
<headline>IPE Brent rebounds, ignoring U.S. inventory data.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent futures were firmer in early Wednesday trade, as the market found some support after setting a new 12-month low late on Tuesday and moved higher.</p>
<p>And gas oil survived a minor blip at the open to stand unchanged on the day at $161.50 a barrel by 0955 GMT. Brent was up 12 cents at $17.62 a barrel.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was in a consolidatory phase as it recovered from the losses of the last two sessions and shrugged off U.S. inventory data.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was very oversold at the close last night, far greater than the WTI,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>Figures from this week's American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. crude oil stocks held in primary storage rose 336,000 barrels in the week ended June 6. Distillate stocks rose 1.94 million barrels and gasoline stocks increased by 2.71 million barrels.</p>
<p>Dealers said the figures showed stocks were lower than expected and they had a largely benign effect on the market.</p>
<p>And with low volumes in London, the market was waiting for direction from the U.S. despite the firmer tone, they said further losses could be expected when NYMEX kicked in.  </p>
<p>&quot;Overall, the stats confirm the bearish fundamental trend of the recent past,&quot; broker GMI said.</p>
<p>Rising gasoline stocks could be a possible cause of downward pressure when the U.S. markets open later but crude was unlikely to move lower.</p>
<p>Dealers said Brent still had technical support intact around $17.50 and looked set for a move higher.</p>
<p>&quot;The gasoline build is certainly one to watch. It could hit the products later but Brent looks ready for a bounce,&quot; another broker said.</p>
<p>A fall to $17.45 late on Tuesday was not regarded as a threat to support for Brent as it took place in thin volume and late in the session.</p>
