<p>While Quebec's economy falters with rising unemployment, weak growth and flagging investment, its French-speaking majority and English-speaking minority are embroiled in another bitter battle over language.</p>
<p>Certain Quebec nationalists advocating the secession of the French-speaking Canadian province want the separatist Parti Quebecois government to further restrict the use of English.</p>
<p>After threatening to boycott Quebec retail stores that do not post signs in English, activists for the rights of the province's 700,000 English speakers are set to take their protest campaign to Wall Street, which bankrolls much of the province's C$100 billion ($73 billion) public debt.</p>
<p>At the centre of the squabble are Quebec government inspectors -- referred to derisively by English speakers as the &quot;language police&quot; or &quot;tongue troopers&quot; -- who examine commercial signs to ensure the French text is twice the size of the English wording.</p>
<p>In August, language officials notified Schwartz's, a landmark Montreal delicatessen, that its luncheon special placards contravened the language law. The deli's accusers were anonymous.</p>
<p>Last spring, language officials ordered the removal of Kosher products from grocery store shelves just before Passover because they were not properly labelled in French. After an outcry from Montreal's Jewish community, the Quebec government agreed in August to exempt certain Passover products from language regulations.</p>
<p>The incongruous images of the latest flare-up in Quebec's interminable language feud are fertile fodder for the Canadian province's political columnists, cartoonists and commentators.</p>
<p>&quot;In Quebec, we have grown men who earn their daily bread by going out every day, armed with tape measures, to ensure that the English on commercial signs is half the size of the French lettering,&quot; wrote internationally acclaimed author and humorist Mordecai Richler in Montreal's English-language daily newspaper, The Gazette.</p>
<p>Quebec officials insist that Richler's tongue-in-cheek depiction of the language inspectors is off the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an amusing, but enormously wrong caricature,&quot; said Hubert Troestler, spokesman for Quebec's Office de la langue francaise.</p>
<p>&quot;The law speaks of clear predominance, which means visually, French should be prevail over all other languages. There is no need to measure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Quebec's official language is French, and several laws enacted since 1974 have variously toughened, then relaxed restrictions on the rights of its 7.3 million residents to be educated in English or post commercial signs in languages other than French.</p>
<p>Under pressure from its more militant members, the Parti Quebecois government recently hired 15 inspectors who will act on complaints that English is not deferring to French on commercial signs.</p>
<p>In the last week of August, the Quebec government began parliamentary hearings on Bill 40, which among other things, would reincarnate the Commission de la protection de la langue francaise (Protection of the French Language Commission). The commission and its language inspectors were disbanded in 1993 by Quebec's previous Liberal government.</p>
<p>Monique Vezina, a former federal Conservative cabinet minister and currently president of the separatist organisation Mouvement National des Quebecois, told the hearings that Quebec needs a tougher law to counteract Canada's official bilingualism.</p>
<p>&quot;This law does not go far enough. Quebec must be freed of the federal government's constraints,&quot; Vezina said.</p>
<p>Opposition members and English-rights activists attacked the government's language policy plans as provocative and undemocratic.</p>
<p>Mario Dumont, head of the tiny Action Democratique du Quebec, who campaigned for sovereignty in the referendum separatists narrowly lost last October, told the hearings that the Quebec government is obsessed with language at the expense of the province's economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The Parti Quebecois is caught up with its linguistic obsessions. It should re-examine its priorities,&quot; Dumont said.</p>
<p>Dumont said the government is reviving the language debate while the province's 12.4 percent unemployment rate is in danger of heading higher.</p>
<p>Louis Balthazar, political science professor at Laval Universty, said in an interview that the latest language skirmish is simply a precursor to Quebec's next referendum on sovereignty, which may be more than two years away.</p>
<p>&quot;You have an English-speaking minority that fears that Quebec will become sovereign one day,&quot; Balthazar said.</p>
<p>At the parliamentary hearings, Quebec culture minister Louise Beaudoin left little doubt the language issue is central to the separatists' independence drive.</p>
<p>&quot;French is still not Quebec's common language. Only sovereignty will allow the development of our identity and our culture,&quot; Beaudoin said.</p>
<p>Yet according to Canada's 1991 census, 2.4 million Quebec residents said they understood both French and English, while four million said they spoke only French and 374,000 indicated they were unilingual English speakers.</p>
<p>As for the unusual outry from Quebec's English-speaking community, Reed Scowen, Quebec's former delegate-general for the United States, said it is simply finding its democratic voice after getting a big scare in the close referendum vote.</p>
<p>&quot;The trauma of the referendum and its result was a wake-up call for the English community here,&quot; Scowen said.</p>
