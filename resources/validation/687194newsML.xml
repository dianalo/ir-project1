<p>The American Medical Association's membership on Tuesday reaffirmed the group's support for legislation that would ban so-called partial birth abortions.</p>
<p>The group's policy-setting House of Delegates turned back efforts that would have withdrawn the AMA Board of Trustees support from anti-abortion legislation that has passed both the House and Senate and is awaiting a likely veto by President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Instead it adopted a statement that maintains support for the pending legislation as written while saying that more work needs to be done in Congress and in state legislatures to delete criminal penalties against doctors for violations of any ban.</p>
<p>Along with that, the delegates at their semi-annual meeting approved portions of a report on late-term abortions that recommends only extremely restricted use of dilation and extraction -- the procedure called &quot;partial birth abortion&quot; by those who would ban it.</p>
<p>The report had concluded that the procedure should never be used unless &quot;alternative procedures pose materially greater risk to the woman.&quot;</p>
<p>The report also said &quot;there does not appear to be any identified situation in which intact dilation and extraction is the only appropriate procedure to induce abortion, and ethical concerns have been raised about (it).&quot;</p>
<p>The AMA has historically opposed governmental bans on or interference with medical procedures.</p>
<p>But earlier this year when it became apparent that legislation calling for a ban was likely to pass Congress, the group's Board of Trustees agreed to support it after winning what it said were important modifications in language.</p>
<p>Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood, blasted the AMA's vote, calling it &quot;a cynical decision that runs counter to the core of the AMA commitment to protect the health of Americans.... This decision places politics above medicine.&quot;</p>
<p>Nancy Dickey, chairman of the AMA Board of Trustees and president-elect of the medical group, said changes the AMA was able to make in the legislation made it less vague. She said it had reduced the possibility that abortion foes could have used the legislation to go after doctors who performed other types of legal abortions.</p>
<p>After Tuesday's vote, Dickey told reporters it was &quot;the right decision for our patients&quot; and showed that the membership was &quot;sensitive&quot; to maintaining the credibility of the group's leadership in Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;It is too costly to flip on this issue,&quot; one delegate said during debate. &quot;We would have no further credibility in Washington.&quot;</p>
<p>But Feldt said Tuesday's decision was a slap in the face of American women. &quot;Sadly, today's action suggested that the AMA is committed not to the women of America, but to protecting their members and preserving their bargaining power in Congress,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The legislation apparently did not pass the Senate by a large enough margin to overturn Clinton's likely veto.</p>
<p>About 40 percent of U.S. doctors belong to the AMA but the delegate body includes specialty groups and is representative of about 90 percent of the medical profession, according to the group.</p>
