<p>Miltiadis Evert was re-elected leader of Greece's conservative opposition New Democracy party on Friday, defeating challenger George Souflias.</p>
<p>Party officials said Evert, who resigned as leader last week after a national election defeat, received 103 votes from party delegates to 84 for Souflias.</p>
<p>&quot;We are turning a new page,&quot; Evert told reporters after his victory. &quot;No one lost. There are no winners or losers.&quot;</p>
<p>Evert resigned as party president after losing elections on September 22, saying he was assuming responsibility for New Democracy's failure to oust the ruling socialists.</p>
<p>A stocky, outspoken former mayor of Athens, Evert was blamed for the election defeat by many conservatives who said his populist style had failed to inspire voters.</p>
<p>The serious, professorial speeches of the socialist Prime Minister Costas Simitis, appeared more convincing than Evert's fist-banging oratory.</p>
<p>The election returned the socialists to power with a strong absolute majority in parliament despite opinion poll predictions of a neck-and-neck race.</p>
<p>Evert's resignation ignited a fierce leadership battle in New Democracy, with many young members rushing to declare their candidacy.</p>
<p>But new faces, such as Dora Bakoyianni and Constantine Karamanlis, dropped out, leaving Souflias, a former education and national economy minister, as Evert's only challenger.</p>
<p>&quot;There are people in every town, in every village, who are telling us to set bickering aside and look at the problems the country is facing,&quot; Evert said.</p>
