<title>JAPAN: Hashimoto says Japan may give food to Pyongyang.</title>
<headline>Hashimoto says Japan may give food to Pyongyang.</headline>

<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto hinted on Thursday that Japan may reverse its policy on food aid to North Korea and agree to provide help if South Korea asks it to do so, a Japanese news agency reported.</p>
<p>Japan has been refusing to give food aid to famine-stricken North Korea because it says the Pyongyang government was behind a string of kidnappings of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and is also involved in drug smuggling.</p>
<p>But Kyodo news agency quoted Hashimoto as saying on Thursday that the Japanese government may change its mind if South Korea formally intercedes on Pyongyang's behalf.</p>
<p>&quot;If the South Korean government asks us for assistance to compatriots in North Korea, there is room for the Japanese side to change its stance (on giving food aid),&quot; Kyodo quoted Hashimoto as telling a group of visiting South Korean newspaper editors.</p>
<p>Officials at the Prime Minister's Office and the Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the Kyodo report.</p>
<p>Tokyo has also demanded that Pyongyang allow Japanese wives of Koreans living in North Korea to visit their homeland.</p>
<p>&quot;There is the problem of Japanese wives, and allegations that 10 Japanese have been kidnapped in addition to the alleged abduction of a teenage schoolgirl and suspicions about stimulant smuggling,&quot; Hashimoto was quoted as telling the editors.</p>
<p>North Korea has denied involvement in the kidnappings and has not formally commented on the recent drug smuggling case.</p>
<p>Japan normalised relations with South Korea in 1965 but has yet to establish diplomatic ties with North Korea.</p>
<p>Normalisation talks have been stalled since 1993 over Japan's persistent demands that North Korea clear up the unsolved kidnapping cases.</p>
<p>But Japan has come under pressure to join South Korea, the United States and international organisations in providing food aid to North Korea, which has been hit by two years of floods that devastated a substantial part of its rice paddies.</p>
<p>&quot;We are ready to think about that (food aid) if we are asked to render aid by the South Korean government. Anyhow, we will have inter-governmental consultation,&quot; Kyodo quoted Hashimoto as saying.</p>
