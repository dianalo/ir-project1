<headline>NY plea bargain in Nepalese student's death.</headline>
<dateline>POTSDAM, N.Y. 1997-04-10</dateline>

<p>Two fraternity brothers pleaded guilty on Thursday to charges stemming from a hazing incident in which a 17-year-old student from Nepal was forced to drink so much liquor that he threw up and died in his own vomit.</p>
<p>The two students are among 12 members of the Theta Chi Fraternity facing charges in the death of Clarkson University freshman Binaya Oja at the Feb. 8 hazing in upstate New York.</p>
<p>Three of the other defendants have filed to dismiss the charges and prosecutors are waiting to hear whether the other seven will accept a plea agreement or stand trial.</p>
<p>Potsdam Village Justice Thomas Wheeler ordered a pre-sentencing investigation and set sentencing for May 29.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Gary Dawson said 18 of the 21 people in the initiation were forced to drink alcohol until they vomited.</p>
<p>&quot;It is amazing that people do this recreationally,&quot; said Dawson. &quot;This was supposed to be fun for them.&quot;</p>
<p>Oja, whose father is a modern languages professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and whose mother lives in their native Nepal, was then left in a room of the fraternity house where he choked on his own vomit and died. His body was found the next morning.</p>
<p>Prosecutors were planning to charge the fraternity in Oja's death, but Theta Chi's national directors stepped in and agreed to disband Clarkson University's chapter.</p>
<p>Keith Sheldon, 21, of Fort Edward and Matthew Rizzo, 19, of Niagara Falls pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree hazing and one count of first-degree unlawfully dealing with a child, both misdemeanors, as part of a plea bargain.</p>
<p>All 12 defendants have been free on $1,000 bail since they were charged.</p>
