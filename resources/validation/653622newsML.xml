<p>The U.S. military airlift that evacuated 56 Americans and other foreigners from strife-torn Brazzaville took only 26 minutes to complete,  the general in charge said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A 12-man team specially flown in from Germany waited for gunfire to die down at Congo's main airport before landing and swinging into action, Brig. Gen. Geoffrey Lambert said.</p>
<p>Lambert, who directed Tuesday's operation from Stuttgart, said the U.S. team circled overhead for 10 minutes as French allies on the ground monitored gunfire aimed at the airport's fire station.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at the Pentagon by telephone, Lambert said no gunfire was aimed directly at the C-130 cargo plane, even though planes had landed at the Brazzaville airfield as recently as Monday &quot;full of holes.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked whether the gunfire had recurred since Tuesday's late-afternoon operation, Lambert said that in fact there was &quot;considerable firing...lots of fighting on the street&quot; at 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT) on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officials on the ground said the &quot;line of conflict&quot; was shifting, according to Lambert. He said they put the current line of conflict about &quot;a block and a half, two blocks&quot; from the U.S. embassy.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a moving confrontation line right now,&quot; Lambert said.</p>
<p>The Americans and third country nationals were flown to Libreville, Gabon.</p>
