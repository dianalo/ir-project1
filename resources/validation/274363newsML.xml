<headline>FEATURE - Malaysian banks favoured on merger hopes.</headline>

<p>Malaysian banks have become the stock market's top flavour in the past few months amid a swirl of real and rumoured mergers in the industry's scramble to create hardier financial institutions, analysts said.</p>
<p>The ball started rolling in spectacular fashion when major institutional broker Rashid Hussain Bhd engineered the country's biggest bank merger by combining its DCB Holdings Bhd's banking arm with Kwong Yik Bank Bhd for 2.16 billion ringgit ($857 million).</p>
<p>Rashid's November deal followed the first success at match-making by the central bank when Pacific Bank Bhd and the Malaysian operations of Singapore's Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp Bhd (OCBC), said in May they would merge.</p>
<p>On December 16, Sime Darby Bhd joined the lengthening bank list when the conglomerate announced it was targeting to buy at least a 51 percent equity stake in Oriental Bank Bhd and merge it with its Sime Bank Bhd.</p>
<p>Oriental, a medium-sized bank, is currently a 78.4 percent subsidiary of Malaysian Industrial Development Finance Bhd (MIDF).</p>
<p>CENTRAL BANK ACTING AS MATCHMAKER</p>
<p>With the central bank acting as the go-between to marry off companies ahead of the onset of financial market liberalisation and more intense competition in 2005, the Malaysian banking industry will be in flux.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't avoid mergers. They're inevitable, with the central bank as the matchmaker,&quot; said Amin Abdul Manap, banking analyst at Mohaiyani Research.</p>
<p>Bank Negara wants local banks to become bigger and better-capitalised to face oncoming competition from foreign institutions.</p>
<p>Unless the local banks become stronger, there is a danger that they may lose out from the entry of giant international banks into Malaysia, officials said.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on December 16: &quot;The decision to encourage the merger of smaller local financial institutions is to strengthen the financial system in Malaysia.</p>
<p>&quot;Our aim is to make them into meaningful and significant institutions in order to compete effectively and to serve the needs of the country and market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Added a financial analyst at Jupiter Securities: &quot;Bank Negara is really looking to create large banks. We are looking at eight to 10 really big ones compared to 37 now.&quot;</p>
<p>TOO MANY BANKS FOR TOO FEW PEOPLE</p>
<p>Malaysia is currently seen as &quot;over-banked&quot;, with its small population of 20 million served by 37 commercial banks -- 36 when the DCB-Kwong Yik merger is completed.</p>
<p>Though the government has not issued new bank licences for the past decade, analysts say it may take a long time to reduce 37 banks down to a more manageable number.</p>
<p>At issue in the often hush-hush merger negotiations is price and how the new partners will be restructured, analysts said.</p>
<p>Merging two banks with different corporate cultures and management, and deciding who will control day-to-day operations are not simple matters.</p>
<p>Also, not every bank is willing to be swallowed by its rival, unless the suitor is prepared to pay the price.</p>
<p>&quot;If a buyer wants to maximise his acquisition, the sellers have to pay the price. You cannot have both winning immediately. In the short-term, someone has to pay,&quot; said George John, banking analyst at Amsteel Securities.</p>
<p>As an example, analysts speculated that the Pacific-OCBC union plan may have hit a snag on management control and majority ownership.</p>
<p>Pacific Bank chairman Lin See Yan declined to comment on the merger issue on December 16, telling reporters the negotiations &quot;are at a very sensitive stage&quot;.</p>
<p>MARKET BUZZES WITH RUMOURED MERGERS</p>
<p>In the current rash of bank-marriage speculation, industry sources said there were other attractive candidates with ready suitors.</p>
<p>There have been rumours that medium-sized Hong Leong Bank Bhd may be stalking Ban Hin Lee Bank Bhd. Both banks have, however, denied the market talk.</p>
<p>A cash-raising exercise of 1.2 billion ringgit by Commerce Asset-Holding Bhd in early December raised speculation that it may be set to announce a bank acquisition.</p>
<p>According to market talk, Commerce Asset's Bank of Commerce (Malaysia) Bhd may be targeting to buy Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd, which the government is privatising.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe...the funds are being raised for an impending acquisition or merger with another financial institution,&quot; HLG Securities said in a recent research report.</p>
<p>&quot;Present status of Commerce Asset is comfortable so there should be little impetus to raise the 1.2 billion ringgit other than for an exceptional purchase,&quot; HLG added.</p>
<p>Commerce Asset officials have said the cash call is for its organic expansion, though they did not rule out the possibility of acquiring another bank.</p>
<p>A Bank Bumiputra spokesman said in mid-December that the company was not aware of any acquisition moves apart from market speculation. &quot;Rumours are rumours. We don't know anything,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>MORE DEALS SEEN IN NEW YEAR</p>
<p>With the year end in sight, and bank deals just starting to simmer, analysts and officials say 1997 will see more mergers.</p>
<p>&quot;I won't be surprised if every bank is looking into that possibility and to avoid a situation where it may be swallowed,&quot; MIDF group chief executive Darwis Mohamed Daek said earlier this month. ($1 = 2.52 ringgit)</p>
