<title>SOUTH KOREA: Seoul stocks end higher on technical rebound.</title>
<headline>Seoul stocks end higher on technical rebound.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1997-04-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>A late technical rebound cancelled out early losses, sending the Seoul stock market to a higher close on Friday, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said investors recovered from an early shock, sparked by market gossip about liquidity problems at the Jinro Group. Group officials strongly denied the rumours.</p>
<p>The composite stock index rose 5.90 points to 693.94.</p>
<p>&quot;I see the rebound as technical following sharp falls yesterday,&quot; said Park Ki-pyong of Hanyang Securities. &quot;Smaller capitalised shares spearheaded the rise.&quot; The small-cap sub-index rose 24.02 points to 1,892.64.  </p>
<p>All four listed companies of Jinro Group fell sharply. Both Jinro Ltd and Jinro Industries went limit down to 10,700 won and 5,410 won respectively.</p>
<p>A Jinro group executive said the market exaggerated a Jinro affiliate's payment delay, which he called a procedural error.</p>
<p>But Commerical Bank of Korea, a major creditor of Jinro Ltd, fell 200 won to 4,000.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors widely ignored an announcement by the Securities Supervisory Board that it had found trading irregularities involving Han Mi Pharmaceutical, Korea Zinc and Daesung Resources.  </p>
<p>The result of the watchdog's probe was widely expected and already discounted in the market, brokers said. Han Mi rose 1,400 won to 57,400 and Daesung added 300 won to 88,600.</p>
<p>They said consolidation would continue next week, with the index threatening the 660 mark.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect a see-saw game to prevail next week, with the index fluctuating about 10 points a day,&quot; said Choi Bum of C.S. First Boston. &quot;With no concrete signs of improving economic fundamentals, the market will deepen its consolidation.&quot;</p>
