<p>Firefighters battled on Sunday to contain a raging blaze in the business district of Grand Forks, the latest assault on the North Dakota agricultural city that is already ravaged by a flood.</p>
<p>Firefighters -- unable to reach fire hydrants because they were buried in muddy waters -- finally turned to floodwaters to combat the blaze, which began on Saturday in a multi-storey office building and quickly wiped out four blocks of the city.</p>
<p>By late on Sunday, firefighers appeared to be gaining the upper hand against the blaze. &quot;I am pleased to report that by tonight the fire will be contained,&quot; said Gerald Vein a spokesman for Grand Forks Fire Department.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from the area when the swollen Red River spilled over hastily-erected defences. An unknown number of residents remained against orders, and were at risk of losing their lives as a fire spread through downtown.</p>
<p>The city has endured one disaster after another in recent weeks. A blizzard dumped up to a foot (30 cm) of snow on the area less than two weeks ago, knocking out power and making travel impossible.</p>
<p>The thaw of that record snowfall led to floods covering thousands of acres (hectares) in the valley of the Red River of the North along its gently sloping course northwards toward Canada.</p>
<p>&quot;I did a helicopter flyover this morning...and looking south it appears Grand Forks and East Grand Forks (Minnesota) are in the middle of a lake about 10 or 12 miles (16 to 19 km) in dimension,&quot; said U.S. Representative Earl Pomeroy.</p>
<p>Firefighters searched frantically on Saturday through murky floodwater for hydrants to which they could attach hoses, only to discover that there was no pressure in the city's water system.</p>
<p>In desperation, emergency workers finally used the floodwaters to fight the flames. Firefighers loaded a pumper truck onto the back of a trailer, and then shot floodwaters through the pumper's turret gun. Helicopters also dumped thousands of gallons of water on the blaze.</p>
<p>Vein said three or four firefighters suffered from hypothermia brought on by the frigid floodwaters. Another firefighter was taken to hospital with a cut leg.</p>
<p>Authorities said it might be two weeks or more before residents could return to their homes. Even though floodwaters may subside in five to seven days, emergency officials said it would be at least two weeks until they could get the city's flooded water treatment plant back on line.</p>
<p>In Canada, officials said seven Manitoba towns may be cut off by rising Red River flood water. &quot;If we reach 1996 flood levels plus three or four feet, we could see them completely cut off,&quot; Manitoba Highways and Transportation official Don Kuryk told reporters.</p>
