<p>Norway's Saga Petroleum ASA said on Wednesday that higher oil prices and production, as well as reduced costs, accounted for a 78 percent surge in 1996 operating profits to a record 3.32 billion crowns ($492 million).</p>
<p>In 1995 the company booked operating profits of 1.86 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Saga, Norway's largest listed oil company, said pre-tax profits jumped 72 percent to 3.47 billion crowns from 2.02 billion a year ago. Results after tax and extraordinary items rose 42 percent to 786 million crowns against 555 million crowns.</p>
<p>Net profits included a 171 million crown gain from the sale of shares in Norwegian metals producer Elkem and an extraordinary expense of 1.54 billion crowns due to a change in Norwegian accounting principles for exploration costs.</p>
<p>The results did not include contributions from British-based Santa Fe Exploration, which Saga acquired in December to form Saga Petroleum UK. Santa Fe, however, was included in Saga's balance sheet for the period July 1 to December 31.</p>
<p>Saga said it proposed to raise its dividend to 3.25 crowns per share, up from 2.50 crowns in 1995.</p>
<p>Under U.S. accounting principles, Saga posted an operating profit of 3.49 billion crowns and a pre-tax result, which did not include an extraordinary item, of 3.69 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Analysts said the figures were largely in line with expectations and the company's share price was up three crowns at 126 crowns in early, light trade on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Saga said it increased proved and probable reserves during 1996 by 27 percent, or 305 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), to 1.438 billion boe, evenly distributed between oil and gas.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, remaining proved reserves were 951 million boe compared with 791 million boe for 1995.</p>
<p>In addition to its acquisition of offshore group Santa Fe Exploration, it said the growth in reserves largely came from the Varg, Oseberg Syd, Troll, Snorre and Gullfaks fields on the Norwegian continental shelf.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important feature of the results is the upgrade in reserves, and not from acquisitions but from new finds or revisions to earlier estimates,&quot; one analyst said. &quot;Its reserve base will be the most satisfying to the (stock) market.&quot;</p>
<p>Investment in oilfields and transport systems totalled 2.39 billion crowns, excluding Santa Fe, compared with 1.95 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>Saga said field investments were mainly in Saga-operated prospects in the North Sea Snorre area, and Aasgard and Norne in the Norwegian Sea off mid-Norway, plus development of oil reserves from Troll and four small fields in the Gullfaks and Oseberg areas.</p>
<p>Group production in 1996 was 47 million barrels of oil and 714 million cubic metres of gas. Saga said the average oil price obtained was 135 crowns per barrel compared with 108 crowns per barrel a year earlier.</p>
