<p>Mineral-rich Shaba province, where a desire for autonomy runs deep, looks more to South Africa and its southern neighbours than the rest of Zaire.</p>
<p>In many ways it has already broken the link with the rest of the sprawling nation at the heart of Africa, but the long arm of central government in Kinshasa still holds some sway.</p>
<p>Sporadic outbreaks of violence and years of economic decline have left Zaire's regions better connected with surrounding countries than with each other.</p>
<p>&quot;Look around the supermarket, 90 percent of the goods come from South Africa, a lot of the rest comes from Belgium,&quot; says Coundouris Jean at the Psarommatis Stores.</p>
<p>Much more than supermarket luxuries find their way up from the south. Almost all the maize imported to cover a shortfall in the local staple does too -- and it is is not one-way trade.</p>
<p>Since the transport route to Zaire's Atlantic port of Matadi has rotted away, Shaba's copper and cobalt are carried either via Tanzania by rail or trucked to South Africa.</p>
<p>South African mining firms are showing interest in working with state-run Gecamines on huge copper and cobalt deposits.</p>
<p>Gecamines already employs a South African security firm to stop products and equipment crossing into Zambia illegally.</p>
<p>The Sizarail railway run for the Zaire government by a South African and Belgian consortium has in little over a year been able to open up lines that were virtually abandoned.</p>
<p>But what do still find their way up to Kinshasa are the receipts from the mines -- a source of resentment that has pushed Shaba to make several bids to break away since independence from Belgium in 1960.</p>
<p>&quot;We are treated worse than a colony,&quot; says Lukonde Kyenge, of the Union of Federalists and Independent Republicans (UFERI), the most popular political party in the region.</p>
<p>UFERI wants more autonomy, 70 percent of the mining receipts to stay in the region, and a national government concerned only with foreign affairs and defence of Zaire's borders.</p>
<p>UFERI's often heated claims are treated seriously by the central government which relies heavily on mining receipts.</p>
<p>The arm of central government may not be strong but it was long enough in 1995 to remove Shaba governor and UFERI leader Kyungu wa Kumwanza after allegations that he tried to import arms to secede.</p>
<p>Now UFERI is pinning its hopes on elections scheduled by May 1997 and threatening to go its own way if they are not held.</p>
<p>&quot;The political extremists do not have the power they did before. People here see that an independent Katanga is unrealistic and that violence has only brought further poverty,&quot; said Shaba-born Yumba Monga, technical director at Gecamines.</p>
<p>Calls by UFERI in 1993 to expel people from the neighbouring Kasai region brought misery, confusion and the near collapse of Gecamines, one third of whose workforce came from the region.</p>
<p>But the laid-back pace of Lubumbashi gives no hint of crisis, not even as the rest of the country looks in a more precarious state than it has for years.</p>
<p>In the east, Tutsi-led rebels have taken over the major towns of Bukavu and Goma and talk of taking over the country.</p>
<p>In Kinshasa students have taken to the streets calling for the government to go for not doing enough to halt the rebels.</p>
<p>President Mobutu Sese Seko, the strongman who has ruled Zaire for over 30 years with guile and cunning, is in Europe recovering from cancer surgery.</p>
<p>&quot;More than anywhere in Zaire, Shaba has the chance to prosper now, and there is no doubt the people I speak to want that,&quot; said a missionary in Lubumbashi for almost 20 years.</p>
<p>&quot;What people fear is that a political vacuum without elections and with Mobutu dead may bring what is happening in the rest of Zaire to Shaba as well.&quot;</p>
