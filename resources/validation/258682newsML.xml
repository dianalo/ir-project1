<p>High sulphur fuel oil prices on Monday were assessed higher on crude gains, healthy Chinese demand and limited supplies, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said prices on Monday were expected to rise above Friday's quotes. High sulphur 180-cst fuel oil prices were assessed at $119-$121 on Friday.</p>
<p>Chinese appetite for oil is propping up prices, traders said. Chinese bids were heard at $7-$8 per tonne over Singapore spot quotes on a cost-and-freight basis to south China.</p>
<p>Offers from South Korea were heard at $2 per tonne on a free-on-board basis.  </p>
<p>A Singapore trader was also seen buying any available supplies, said a trader from a major oil firm.</p>
<p>In the swaps market, traders said Chinese state-trader Sinochem has been particularly active in recent weeks. January swaps were quoted at $120.50/$122, up from $119.25/$120.25 on Friday.</p>
