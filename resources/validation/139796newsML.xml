<p>Sierra Leone's president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and rebel leader Foday Sankoh met in Ivory Coast on Thursday and Sankoh said afterwards he was keen to return home to seek a fresh mandate from his fighters to talk peace.</p>
<p>The Sierra Leone government, in a statement issued in the capital Freetown, said Kabbah had agreed to Sankoh returning with international observers but set a December 1 deadline for completing the peace process.</p>
<p>Sankoh, in remarks to reporters later, accused the Kabbah government of breaching a truce in force since March.</p>
<p>&quot;We do respect the ceasefire but Kabbah and his government is not respecting the ceasefire,&quot; he said, adding he had been waiting to talk to his fighters for the past six months.</p>
<p>&quot;I need to renew my mandate from my combatants and the People's War Council for further negotiations or signing any peace accord with the so-called government in Freetown.&quot;</p>
<p>Sankoh said he wanted representatives of the United Nations, the Organisation of African Unity, the Commonwealth and other international organisations to accompany him.</p>
<p>The Freetown government said Kabbah agreed to the request. Sankoh said he hoped to leave in early November.</p>
<p>Ivorian President Henri Konan Bedie chaired the meeting in the commercial capital Abidjan.</p>
<p>A senior military official said in Freetown earlier that the army had knocked out a rebel communications and logistics base in the north, near the strategic highway from Freetown to the second town of Bo. He said troops killed 60 rebels.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses said mercenaries from a private South African security firm had led the attack.</p>
<p>Kabbah took over in April when the army restored civilian rule after four years in power. A string of attacks blamed on the rebels, who took up arms in 1991, has put the truce under strain but neither side has spoken of abandoning it.</p>
