<p>U.S. demand for petroleum products in the third quarter rose 1.9 percent to 18.07 million barrels per day from the same period a year ago, the American Petroleum Institute said Wednesday.</p>
<p>At the same time, U.S. crude oil production in the lower 48 states posted its first year-to-year increase in five years, helped by 20,000 bpd of output from the Mars field in the Gulf of Mexico, API said. But total crude production was down 0.3 percent to 6.42 million bpd, API said.</p>
<p>In Alaska, third quarter production fell by 3.7 percent, which was less than half the drop in the last four quarters.  </p>
<p>Third quarter distillate demand as measured by deliveries jumped 4.2 percent to 3.14 million bpd over Q3 1995, which API said was stronger than economic indicators suggested.</p>
<p>Most of the increase was due to a 300,000 bpd increase in July, which partly reflected &quot;unusually low levels&quot; of distillate deliveries in July last year.</p>
<p>Underlying year-to-year growth in the third quarter was probably closer to 2.0 to 2.5 percent, API said.</p>
<p>Third quarter gasoline demand, as measured by product supplied, rose just 0.3 percent to 7.98 million bpd from the previous year, &quot;despite other indicators that consumption is growing at around 1 percent or more,&quot; API said.</p>
<p>Jet kerosene deliveries jumped 7.2 percent to 1.6 million bpd, largely based on growth in commercial air traffic.</p>
<p>Demand for residual fuel grew 6.1 percent to 857,000 bpd in the quarter, although high oil prices were making residual fuel less competitive with natural gas in power plants. Total product imports jumped 10.4 percent to 1.82 million bpd.</p>
<p>However, total crude imports in the third quarter rose just 1.5 percent to 7.68 million bpd from the previous year, with sales of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve helping to stem the tide of imports, API said.</p>
