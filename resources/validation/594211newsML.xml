<title>UK: UK natgas slips across the board in thin trade.</title>
<headline>UK natgas slips across the board in thin trade.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>The UK spot natural gas market softened on Monday, traders and brokers said, although there was a quiet start to the week with fewer deals seen than on most days over the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Most trade was done direct between counterparties, with brokers barely involved in the market.</p>
<p>One trader said of the eight deals his company transacted over the day, six were done with the same counterparty during a single phone call.</p>
<p>Prices were weaker across the board.</p>
<p>The third quarter saw bids dip below 11.00 pence a therm, although trade was not confirmed done below this level.</p>
<p>Q4 was also slightly weaker, traded at 14.00 pence a therm though later offered at that price and bid well below. And Q1 traded at 16.825 pence, when it had bid at 17.00 pence at the close of trade on Friday.</p>
<p>Dealers were uncertain as to the cause of the weakness, although one said prices had fallen &quot;to where they should have been after the mad see-saw,&quot; referring to the volatile days at the end of last week when prices climbed steadily, then fell back sharply, then recovered some ground.</p>
<p>The futures market saw some activity, with the IPE trading 45 lots in the first quarter in three deals.</p>
<p>The average price for the quarter was 16.90 pence a therm, comparable to the OTC market. But while the OTC market fell to that level, the IPE climbed to reach the same price, indicating how levels on the two markets had got out of kilter at the end of last week when the IPE saw no trade for long periods.</p>
