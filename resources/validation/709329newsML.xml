<p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations will admit Cambodia as a new member as planned despite fighting in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, a senior official with ASEAN member the Philippines said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;We're watching it (the situation) but as of now the decision (to accept Cambodia) stands. There is no change in the decision,&quot; Philippine Foreign Under-Secretary Rodolfo Severino told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously, if the state collapses we have to rethink it,&quot; he said. &quot;But that's really a hypothetical situation. I don't think it's going to happen.&quot;</p>
<p>Fellow ASEAN member Thailand said the political developments in Cambodia would be taken up at the group's foreign ministers' meeting to be held in Malaysia from July 22-28.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have to consider the latest events in Cambodia and what to do at our next ASEAN ministerial meeting in Kuala Lumpur,&quot; Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn told Reuters in Bangkok.</p>
<p>Philippine President Fidel Ramos, in a statement, called on forces of Cambodia's two rival prime ministers to &quot;settle their disputes peacefully and avoid further violence&quot;.</p>
<p>ASEAN has agreed to accept Cambodia, Burma and Laos as new members and their entry had been expected to be formalised this month. Apart from the Philippines and Thailand, the group comprises Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Severino said he had been due to visit Cambodia on Sunday to discuss how ASEAN could help integrate the country into the group. The trip was made impossible by the closure of Phnom Penh airport.</p>
<p>Severino suggested ASEAN could play role in helping bring an end to the fighting.</p>
<p>&quot;If one of the members is in trouble then we'll just have to try whatever we can to help... After all, this would not be a new role for ASEAN,&quot; he said, recalling that ASEAN helped bring about the 1991 Cambodia peace settlement.</p>
<p>In Hanoi, a senior ASEAN diplomat said: &quot;I think the ASEAN countries will have to change their position.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know how ASEAN will handle the admission of a country on the verge of civil war.&quot;</p>
<p>Fighting erupted in Phnom Penh on Saturday between forces loyal to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and those of rival First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh.</p>
<p>At least 12 people have been killed in the shelling and gunfire which sparked an exodus by thousands of city residents.</p>
<p>Ranariddh accused Hun Sen of launching a coup attempt but the second premier has denied the charge.</p>
<p>Leading Filipino political analyst Max Soliven said one problem for ASEAN if it accepted Cambodia now would be which government to recognise. &quot;They will probably have to hold Cambodia's membership in abeyance because whom will they recognise?&quot; Soliven said.</p>
