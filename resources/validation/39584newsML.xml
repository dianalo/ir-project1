<p>Steffi Graf, the world number one women's tennis player, denied charges raised at her father's tax evasion trial that she was aware of a scheme to keep tax collectors away from her earnings, a newspaper said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Bild am Sonntag said that Steffi Graf, due to play in the U.S. Open final on Sunday, had released a statement in New York denying an allegation that the Graf family's former tax advisor, Joachim Eckardt, had raised in court on Friday.</p>
<p>Eckardt, on trial alongside Peter Graf for tax evasion, told the state court in Mannheim that Steffi Graf was fully aware since 1991 that he and Peter Graf had been concealing large amounts of her tournament winnings and sponsorship money.</p>
<p>&quot;Even Steffi knew about the details of what was going on since the middle of 1991,&quot; Eckardt testified, directly contradicting remarks made by Peter Graf on the trial's opening day on Thursday.</p>
<p>But Steffi Graf responded in her statement to Bild am Sonntag that Eckardt had never informed her during these conversations that there was anything illegal about the scheme to park the money outside Germany.</p>
<p>Peter Graf, a 58-year-old former used car salesman who has spent the last 13 months in custody and faces a 10-year jail sentence if convicted, said he had kept his daughter in the dark about her finances.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege Graf and Eckardt failed to declare to authorities 42 million marks ($28 million) worth of income between 1989 and 1993 and failed to pay 19 million marks ($13 million) in taxes from the late 1980s.</p>
