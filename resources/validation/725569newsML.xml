<p>Bank Austria plans to open three new branches in Croatia and says it hopes to be able to offer cheap private loans later this year, chairman of the bank's board in Croatia Anton Knett told Slobodna Dalmacija daily.</p>
<p>&quot;We are planning to open branches in Rijeka, Split and Dubrovnik. The Dubrovnik branch will be opened at the end of this or at the beginning of next year,&quot; Knett said in an interview published on Monday.</p>
<p>The bank's base capital is 100 million kuna, 80 percent of which is owned by Bank Austria and 20 percent by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the report said.</p>
<p>Knett said he hoped savings would grow and the bank was looking at a figure of 100-150 million kuna worth of deposits in Bank Austria Croatia by the end of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;I am quite sure that in the near future we will be able to offer Croatian citizens favourable loans,&quot; Knett said, adding that private clients would be offered personal loans possibly before the autumn, depending on the level of savings. &quot;If they place more money with us we will be able to ensure more means for giving out loans,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It was certain, Knett added, that Bank Austria Croatia would take part in the privatisation of Croatian companies &quot;and hopefully play an important role&quot;.</p>
