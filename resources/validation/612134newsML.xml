<p>Michael Atherton, the ultimate pressure player, led from the front at the Oval on Saturday as England secured an unbeatable 2-0 lead in their one-day series against Australia.</p>
<p>England, who took the opening encounter by six wickets at Headingley on Thursday, won by a similar margin, reaching their target of 250 with 10 balls to spare. The third and final international will be played at Lord's on Sunday.</p>
<p>Atherton, the England captain, hit an unbeaten 113, his second one-day international century, in an effective riposte to the critics who have questioned his place in the one-day squad.</p>
<p>&quot;I must say that since the World Cup I haven't played that well in one-day cricket, but I have never doubted my ability,&quot; he said after receiving the man-of-the-match award. &quot;I feel I'm a pretty good one-day player.&quot;</p>
<p>As he had in Leeds, Atherton won the toss and asked Australia to bat on a fine, dry morning.</p>
<p>At first the World Cup finalists threatened to self-destruct when four of their six wickets fell to run-outs through a mixture of careless running and fine throwing.</p>
<p>It was left to Michael Bevan, ably assisted by reserve wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist, to turn the innings round and ensure Australia reached a competitive 249 for six from their 50 overs.</p>
<p>Bevan, top scorer for Australia at Headingley, struck an unbeaten 108 of 129 balls with six fours while Gilchrist looked a particularly effective one-day player during his sprightly 53.</p>
<p>Alec Stewart ensured a brisk start for England after Nick Knight had again departed early, moving his feet crisply to nullify Shane Warne and playing the shot of the day when he moved down the pitch to drive paceman Michael Kasprowicz for four.</p>
<p>When he departed, bowled for 40 off his pads by Warne, Atherton took control, playing with particular fluency square on the off-side.</p>
<p>Adam Hollioake, man-of-the-match at Headingley, lent aggressive support late in the innings with his second successive unbeaten half-century of the series.</p>
<p>He finished the game with consecutive boundaries off Kasprowicz, reaching his 50 with the winning hit.</p>
<p>Atherton is determined to increase the margin to 3-0 at Lord's but remains well aware of the task ahead in the six-test Ashes series.</p>
<p>&quot;There's very little correlation between the five-day and one-day series,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Australian captain Mark Taylor, whose miserable international form continued when he was run out for 11, agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the form in the one-dayers will not decide the form in the test matches,&quot; he said. &quot;They are two totally separate games.&quot;</p>
