<title>SINGAPORE: ASIAN EXOTICS - Rupiah shrugs off campaign unrest.</title>
<headline>ASIAN EXOTICS - Rupiah shrugs off campaign unrest.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-05-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Indonesian rupiah firmed in slow Monday morning trade despite news of widespread violence surrounding the country's election campaign.</p>
<p>Dealers said the unrest on the last campaign day for the May 29 poll, which included the deaths of at least 142 people in the South Kalimantan capital of Banjarmasin, did not affect the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was quoted at 2,440.0/41.0 at 0405 GMT against an opening of 2,440.0/42.0.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect operators have gone long on the dollar in the spot market. They also have gone long in forwards,&quot; one dealer in Singapore said, adding that a U.S. public holiday was hampering trade as well.</p>
<p>Dealers said participants seemed to have factored in the risk of violence in the run-up to the general election, keeping the market relatively stable despite sporadic riots.</p>
<p>&quot;I think operators are looking for good levels to sell,&quot; the dealer in Singapore said, adding that there was no reason for forwards to go higher because of cheap tom/next swaps.</p>
<p>A U.S. bank dealer in Singapore said the dollar was looking supported around 2,440.0 but its upside would be capped around 2,445.0/47.0 ahead of the election.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Thai baht had a very subdued morning as players in both domestic and offshore markets awaited the announcement of new monetary measures from the central bank's press briefing, due to begin at 0400 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;Most players were reluctant to take new positions this morning as they are eagerly waiting for the central bank's new measures,&quot; a dealer at a foreign bank in Bangkok said.</p>
<p>Thai Bankers Association president Olarn Chaiprawat said on Sunday that he expected the Bank of Thailand (BOT) to give a strong signal for a domestic interest rate cut on Monday.</p>
<p>Olarn said the central bank was also likely to come up with new measures to formally separate the offshore and onshore foreign exchange markets.</p>
<p>The baht/dollar forex market has been informally divided into offshore and local markets since the central bank moved to cut off offshore players' access to the baht when the currency came under speculative attack almost two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The U.S. bank dealer in Singapore said the offshore market was unlikely to be much moved by news of a cut in the BOT's discount rate, as interest in the baht had been severely dampened by the creation of a two-tier market.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, the ringgit firmed a few notches on the back of the dollar's drop against the mark, but activity remained largely subdued in the absence of fresh leads.</p>
<p>A European bank dealer in Singapore said the market was focusing on the French elections, where losses for President Jacques Chirac's coalition were causing a sell-off in the dollar/mark.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was good dollar buying interest from Kuala Lumpur parties around the 2.4990 ringgit level.</p>
<p>Further south, the Singapore dollar gained some ground from corporate selling of the U.S. dollar but fears of central bank intervention capped the domestic unit's rise, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was (U.S. dollar) selling interest from corporates from the 1.4310 level this morning and it touched a low of 1.4290/95 but local banks are still bidding around there,&quot; the U.S. bank dealer said.</p>
<p>He said wariness of central bank support for the U.S. unit would limit its downside to around 1.4280 for the time being.</p>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore, the de facto central bank, typically intervenes in forex markets through major local banks to stem any sharp moves in the Singapore dollar.</p>
