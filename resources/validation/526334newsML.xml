<p>The founder of South Korea's Daewoo Group said on Monday the group's carmaking unit Daewoo Motor Co planned to start selling passenger cars in the U.S. market in September.</p>
<p>Daewoo Motor chairman Kim Tae-gou also said he expected his company's sales to reach 30,000 units by the end of this year.  </p>
<p>In ending its partnership with General Motors Corp in 1992, Daewoo Motor agreed to stay out of the U.S. market until 1996. Earlier this month, Daewoo said it would resume sales in the market later this year or early next year.</p>
<p>&quot;We plan to start selling cars in the U.S. market from September, and we see college students and professors as our main customers,&quot; Daewoo founder Kim Woo-choong told reporters after a ceremony to open Daewoo Motor's new carmaking plant.</p>
<p>The plant, which has an annual production capacity of 300,000 passenger cars, opened on Monday in the southwestern city of Kunsan.  </p>
<p>Kim Woo-choong also said talks were under way to form a fresh partnership with General Motors to assemble each other's models.</p>
<p>&quot;Talks are under way for a sort of cross-production deal with GM. We expect to see something by around June,&quot; Kim said.</p>
<p>It was not clear from Kim's remarks whether formal negotiations had begun.</p>
<p>Daewoo aims to sell about 100,000 units of its three new models -- Lanos, Nubira and Leganza compact sedans -- in the U.S. market next year, company officials have said.  </p>
<p>Kim also said car sales in Europe would begin late this year and his group hoped to sell about 150,000 units annually.</p>
<p>Daewoo Motor's chairman Kim Tae-gou cited Toyota Motor Corp's Camry and Honda Motor Co's Accord as its main competitor models in the U.S. market.</p>
