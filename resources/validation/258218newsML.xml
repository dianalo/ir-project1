<title>UK: Bradford wool market subdued, topmakers anxious.</title>

<p>The Bradford wool market began the final week of pre-holiday trade in a subdued mood as activity slowed and tops prices were left largely unchanged, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Selling was being dictated by topmakers' need to secure new business rather than to optimise profit margins, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most firms close this weekend for a two-week break and people are leaving the decision-making til afterwards,&quot; one source added.</p>
<p>One major Australian producer described wool as an unprofitable commodity to be involved in, despite recent firmness in raw wool prices in Australia and New Zealand,</p>
<p>Wool processors in the UK and western Europe appeared to share that view. &quot;Prices are being cut just to get whatever business is available simply to keep machinery activity to economic rates,&quot; one European insider said.</p>
<p>UK-based sources said that this was reducing their competitiveness in the export market and that situation was worsened by the strong pound.</p>
<p>Uncertainty over future UK and U.S interest rate movements and recent profit warnings within the industry were fuelling anxiety about trade prospects for early 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Talk of a domestic consumer boom cuts little ice with the UK textile industry - everyone is still finding margins under pressure,&quot; one market commentator said.</p>
