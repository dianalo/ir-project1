<p>South African shipments of platinum group metals (PGMs) could increase slightly in 1996 despite output being hit by labour unrest, according to the Johnson Matthey (JM) Platinum 1996 Interim Review.</p>
<p>The review published by the world's largest refiner of the PGMs on Tuesday forecast South African platinum production at 3.42 million ounces this year against 3.37 million in 1995.</p>
<p>Palladium production would total 1.67 million ounces, up 70,000 ounces from last year.</p>
<p>But the world supply of platinum would decline by about 140,000 ounces as Russian exports were cut back by 180,000 and North American production slipped to 215,000 ounces from 240,000 ounces in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;We do think that (South Africa) shipments are going to rise very slightly which is mainly due to Impala processing a backlog of concentrates,&quot; said the report's author, Alison Cowley.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is no doubt that quite significant amounts of production have been lost by Rustenburg and other producers such as Northam due to strikes and industrial unrest,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The industry has &quot;experienced a significant deterioration in labour relations during 1996. Sporadic wildcat strikes broke out at Rustenburg in March before recurring more seriously between June and August when around 100,000 ounces of platinum were lost,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It forecast calendar-year production at Rustenburg down on the financial year to June 1996 total of 1.553 million ounces following the unoffical stoppage.</p>
<p>Output at Impala was interrupted by an official strike over pay in early August and in the same month, Northam lost production when staff walked out following inter-tribal violence in which six people died.</p>
<p>Calendar year output from Impala was estimated at around one million ounces this year after year-to-June production fell 40,000 ounces to 954,000 ounces.</p>
<p>Impala offset lower tonnage of ore milled and lower head grades by increasing recoveries of the platinum group metals into matte and, &quot;the company expects to achieve further improvements in yields through better mining practices and technical developments at the concentrators,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Lonrho South Africa was forecast to have a slight rise in output to around 580,000 ounces due to improvements in ore throughout and yields.</p>
<p>Northam achieved a design capacity milling rate of 150,000 tonnes in July but has lost production due to tribal conflicts resulting in the departure of several hundred trained workers.</p>
<p>&quot;The loss of trained underground workers is likely to affect throughout in the second half of 1996,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It estimated Northam's platinum output for the calendar year at around 150,000 ounces compared with 120,000 ounces in 1995.</p>
<p>A weaker South African rand has shielded the industry from low world prices. But the weak rand would eventually lead to higher costs, said Cowley.</p>
<p>&quot;Our view is that cost control is the key issue for the industry and really producers are not going to look at expansion programmes,&quot; she said. &quot;They are looking instead to improve their profitability by decreasing unit costs&quot;.</p>
<p>Impala, for example, in the last three years had reduced its expansion target quite considerably and now planned to develop replacement ore reserves in its Deeps lease area.</p>
<p>&quot;(This) will be on the Merensky Reef and will be a relatively more valuable ore...they will be able to increase margins. But they are not increasing production,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>JM precious metals marketing director Keith Green added, &quot;Longer term they are looking at the possiblity that the market will be undersupplied at some stage through the Russians' inability to supply a balancing factor from reserves.</p>
<p>&quot;On the shelf there are expansions plans aimed at meeting a gap,&quot; he said.</p>
