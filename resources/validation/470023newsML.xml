<headline>UK power regulator names advisors to price review.</headline>

<p>British power regulator Stephen Littlechild named the three senior businessmen on Wednesday who will help him set price limits on the 14 electricity suppliers from April 1998.</p>
<p>Littlechild, an academic, has been accused of being out of touch with industry in previous reviews he has undertaken.</p>
<p>So last year he decided to take on three businessmen to help him with his review of the prices of the electricity tranmission network, National Grid Group Plc.</p>
<p>The three businessmen who will sit on an advisory panel looking into allowable charges for electricity supply are:</p>
<p>-- The chairman of AEA Technology Plc and General Cable Plc, Sir Anthony Cleaver.</p>
<p>-- Geoffrey Maitland Smith, former deputy chairman at Midland Bank and retailer Sears Plc.</p>
<p>-- Sir Keith Stuart, chairman of Associated British Ports Holdings Plc.</p>
<p>Littlechild said John Sadler, who helped him with the transmission review and whose experience ranges from the Treasury and Board of Trade to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, will also advise him.</p>
<p>Sadler is the only one who will be paid more than &quot;out of pocket expenses&quot; because he will devote more time to this review, Littlechild said.</p>
<p>&quot;Since my last review in 1993, the (supply) industry has seen some significant changes, and the introduction of competition in 1998 raises particularly complex issues,&quot; Littlechild stated.</p>
<p>Littlechild was forced to reopen his last distribution price review a month before his price cuts were due to come into effect in 1995 after electricity companies revealed the extent of their wealth under the threat of takeover.</p>
