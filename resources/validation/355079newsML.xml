<p>U.S. shares were little changed to slightly lower in quiet European trade as most investors stayed away ahead of the two-day Federal Open Markets Committee(FOMC) meeting which begins later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very dull. People want to get the FOMC out of the way before doing anything,&quot; one market maker said. &quot;It would be a nasty shock if the Fed put up rates this week.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. treasuries were steady after rising overnight on speculation the Fed will refrain from lifting rates due to recent signs that inflation remains dormant.  </p>
<p>Although the Fed is expected to keep interest rates on hold, traders said the bond market was likely to pull back slightly after the meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;The shorts have been taken out, so the market is a little long,&quot; said a trader at a Japanese bank in London.</p>
<p>The March T-bond was down 1/32 at 112-2/32 by 1100 GMT.</p>
<p>WMX Technologies was up $5/8 at $36-3/4 after the company announced a 50 million share repurchase programme as well as a new business strategy that includes cutting capital spending by $900 million in 1997 and the divestiture of $1.5 billion in assets.  </p>
<p>Pepsi was down $1/4 at $33-7/8 ahead of the release of its fourth-quarter figures later today.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people fear Pepsi's restaurant businesses haven't been doing too well which is hurting the shares this morning,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Colgate, which is also due to publish Q4 figures today, was up $3/8 at $96-5/8.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 futures contract on the Globex after-hours trading system was up 0.15 at 789.90.</p>
