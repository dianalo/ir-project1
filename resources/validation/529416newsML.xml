<title>USA: New Orleans' crime-fighting plan is paying off.</title>
<headline>New Orleans' crime-fighting plan is paying off.</headline>
<dateline>NEW ORLEANS 1997-04-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Efforts to fight crime in the streets and within the police department are paying off, according to statistics released Monday by Mayor Marc Morial and Police Superintendent Richard Pennington.</p>
<p>They announced that crime statistics for the first quarter of the year showed a 23 percent decrease in violent crime compared with the same months last year and a 42 percent drop since 1995.</p>
<p>When Pennington took over the police department two years ago, New Orleans was ranked one of the nation's most violent cities. The police department's image was badly tarnished by scandals involving officers charged with offenses ranging from murder to rape to bank robbery.</p>
<p>Pennington has won broad-based community support for cleaning house within the department, raising qualifications for police recruits, and supporting ongoing federal investigations of corrupt officers.</p>
<p>&quot;I am pleased to report that we are making progess in our fight against crime in the city,&quot; Pennington said, citing restructuring within the department, increased accountability and police pay raises for the improvements.</p>
<p>In the first three months of 1997, the murder rate was down 22 percent from 1996; rapes decreased by 23 percent; armed robberies dropped by 32 percent and 20 percent fewer assaults were recorded, Morial said.</p>
<p>Violent crimes in the historic French Quarter, a popular tourist destination, were down by 41 percent, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is important progress, but there is still much to be done,&quot; the mayor added.</p>
