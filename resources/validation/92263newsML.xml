<headline>Eurotunnel, banks agree on basic principles.</headline>

<p>Troubled Anglo-French Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel Plc, which has not paid interest on its eight billion pound debt for more than a year, said Wednesday it reached agreement in principle on a financial restructuring.</p>
<p>The company said that subject to approval from its board and banks, it expected particulars of the plan to be announced early next week. Its shares, which have been suspended, would then be allowed to resume trading.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel, which operates the rail tunnel between Britain and France opened in 1994, froze payments to 225 banks on its debt in September 1995, unable to cope with the loans and cost overruns incurred during construction of the link.</p>
<p>&quot;This is positive in that no one really thought they'd come up with a plan by now and they have,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The Paris commercial court confirmed the deal on basic principles, saying it had been informed that Eurotunnel and the lead negotiators for the banks had drawn up &quot;the main lines of an agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The parties told the president of the Paris commercial court they hoped to submit a definitive protocol at a later date,&quot; said a brief statement from the court.</p>
<p>A source close to the debt restructuring talks said trading in Eurotunnel shares should resume by next Tuesday at the latest.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel shares were suspended on Monday in Paris, London and Brussels to avoid creation of a false market while last-minute debt talks were being held with bankers.</p>
