<headline>Church expects Sudan missionaries to be freed soon.</headline>

<p>Sudanese rebels said on Wednesday they were still trying to contact a rebel commander in south Sudan to order the release of six Roman Catholic missionaries, including three Australian nuns, held for nearly two weeks.</p>
<p>But a church official said the problem was very close to a resolution and he expected them to be freed within a few days.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not reached the local commander but are still trying. Communications are very bad with the area,&quot; said George Garang, Nairobi spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).</p>
<p>&quot;We hope he hears that the leadership wants them released.&quot;</p>
<p>The three nuns, an American priest, an Italian brother and a Sudanese priest have been held by SPLA rebels at Mapourdit, in mainly Christian and animist south Sudan, since August 17.</p>
<p>Australian Sisters Moira Lynch, 73, Mary Batchelor, 68, and Maureen Carey, 52, are held at the mission compound in Mapourdit along with American Father Michael Barton, 48, Sudanese Father Raphael Riel, 48, and Italian Brother Raniero Iacomella, 28.</p>
<p>Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari, apostolic administrator of the diocese of Rumbek in the south, said the church had received lots of promises but there was no resolution to the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;They should be released immediately. We are waiting to hear if the SPLA have managed to contact the local commander. I, of course, hope they will be released today but we are waiting and I estimate it might take today or tomorrow,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very delicate situation but we are very close to a resolution. It is taking time as communications are very poor.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked what would happen when they were freed, Mazzolari said the group were supposed to leave Sudan for a holiday last week and he would ask the three nuns to come out for a break anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;I will see what the fathers want to do but we will not leave the mission. The mission will keep operating,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The missionaries' captors accused four of the group of being spies and agents of Islam after the rebels reportedly found a quotation from the Koran on a bookmark in a Bible belonging to the nuns.</p>
<p>The three Australian nuns, who were teaching at a school for 1,500 in Mapourdit when they were taken captive, may also have tried to resist an effort by the rebels to recruit students.</p>
<p>The United States on Tuesday said it had urged the SPLA to ensure that the local commander, Nuour Marial, who is holding the six missionaries at Mapourdit free them immediately.</p>
<p>The SPLA has fought Khartoum's government forces in the south since 1983 for greater autonomy or independence of the mainly Christian and animist region from the Moslem, Arabised north.</p>
