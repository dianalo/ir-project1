<p>Zairean rebels said on Friday that talks with representatives of President Mobutu Sese Seko would start in South Africa early next week and aid workers said they had found 75,000 refugees in eastern Zaire, many too weak to walk.</p>
<p>&quot;If nothing changes, then the talks will be in South Africa and will begin on either Monday or Tuesday,&quot; Moise Nyarugabo, secretary-general at rebel headquarters, told Reuters in the eastern city of Goma.</p>
<p>In Johannesburg, a government source confirmed that South Africa had been asked to host peace talks and said senior Foreign Ministry officials had started laying the groundwork for negotiations, likely to take place on Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nyarugabo said the essential issue would be to negotiate the transfer of power from the ailing Mobutu to a transitional government led by the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL) led by Laurent Kabila.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a matter of punishing Mobutu, his crimes are so great. After leaving power he may be able to continue to live inside the country and see how it will be transformed when he is gone,&quot; Nyarugabo said.</p>
<p>The rebels, who control a quarter of the sprawling Central African nation, took up arms in October vowing to topple Mobutu while the veteran leader was in Europe recovering from prostate cancer surgery.</p>
<p>The revolt has weakened Mobutu's grip on the former Belgian colony he has dominated since seizing power in 1965. He returned home a week ago after fresh cancer treatment in Europe.</p>
<p>The rebels insist a ceasefire can be declared only after negotiations have begun.</p>
<p>An Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit in Lome, Togo, on Wednesday and Thursday brought together representatives of the warring parties for the first time and they agreed on talks.</p>
<p>The summit closed by calling on both sides to hold immediate talks leading to a ceasefire -- a moral victory for the rebels.</p>
<p>The summit communique said on Thursday that a date for negotiations and a ceasefire would be announced after the two Zairean delegations had consulted their respective parties.</p>
<p>It urged all players to throw their weight behind a peace plan formulated by U.N. and OAU special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun.</p>
<p>Asked on Friday in Goma whether a simultaneous ceasefire and talks would be possible, Nyarugabo said: &quot;Our position remains that a ceasefire has to be negotiated.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The principle is the alliance would form the government, it is not a question of power-sharing. Mobutu's party has been in power for 30 years and the results are evident,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the northeast Zairean capital of Kisangani, aid workers said more than 75,000 exhausted, hungry and sick refugees were scattered on the sides of an 82-km (50-mile) stretch of railway line to the south.</p>
<p>Paul Stromberg, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said the Hutu refugees were found on Thursday by aid workers aboard a train carrying food south of the city.</p>
<p>&quot;There are perhaps 25,000 at Lula, seven km (four miles) south, and 25,000 at Kasea at km 25 (mile 15) and another 25,000 at Biaro at km 40 (mile 25) with groups in between,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are in progressively worse condition the farther you go from Kisangani. Besides those with malnutrition and exhaustion there are some wounded at km 40,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The tens of thousands of Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees on the railway route south of Kisangani are the remnants of 170,000 who fled Tingi Tingi and Amisi this month and have been trekking ever deeper into eastern Zaire for up to five months.</p>
<p>&quot;(At Kasea) I saw the most emaciated people I've ever seen in my life,&quot; said a representative of Refugees International on the train. &quot;Many of these people won't last another day without urgent medical attention.&quot;</p>
