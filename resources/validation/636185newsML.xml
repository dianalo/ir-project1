<title>UK: Metals cut losses on LME, markets end mixed.</title>
<headline>Metals cut losses on LME, markets end mixed.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-04</dateline>

<p>Base metal prices recovered from midsession their nadir during Wednesday afternoon LME trading mostly on shortcovering but a mixed close tended to favour the downside, traders said.</p>
<p>Copper was little changed, aluminium was firmer and the rest of the complex was comfortably above the lows but the rallies were little more than customary position squaring, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a bit of shortcovering around, but the funds are looking to sell at the moment, so the rallies are not really going anywhere,&quot; one floor trader said.</p>
<p>Copper's movements were typical of the day's action - an early rally which was snuffed out, then a midsession sell-off which was followed by a partial late rally.</p>
<p>By the close three months prices were little changed after recovering from a dip under $2,470, but spreads appear to be unravelling and there is little physical interest, so levels near $2,500 will be difficult to sustain at present, traders said.</p>
<p>Last business was at $2,478 a tonne, down just $1 from Tuesday's kerb close. The cash/threes backwardation was at $52/62.</p>
<p>Aluminium was steadier throughout the trading day, as the market had been caught short by the sell-off on Tuesday. However, the bounce did not recapture $1,600, and as physical availability is ample despite falling stocks, prices are seen heading lower in the short term. The market closed at $1,592, up $14.</p>
<p>Nickel staged an impressive rally during late trade, bolstered by the possibility of a long strike at Inco's Sudbury facilities, according to union sources.</p>
<p>Also, the market has settled down after the volatile movements seen earlier this week, and underlying support around $7,000 is looming. Last trade was at $7,200, up $20.</p>
<p>Zinc built on earlier trade buying that emerged on dips towards $1,330 and chased higher during late afternoon ring and kerb trading. Trends in copper assisted the tone and last trade was at $1,350, up $16.</p>
<p>By comparison, lead was sluggish throughout the session and once an earlier decline was checked business was mostly transacted around overnight levels. Prices closed at an unchanged $626.</p>
<p>Tin moved away from midsession lows, but still closed lower with the market fazed by recent talk of Russian stockpile metal moving westwards, as well as overhanging Chinese sales. Last trade was at $5,600, still down $80 from yesterday.</p>
<p>Alloy was quietly stable throughout, and closed $5 higher at $1,480.</p>
