<title>LUXEMBOURG: Court upholds Community controls systems on CAP aid.</title>
<headline>Court upholds Community controls systems on CAP aid.</headline>
<dateline>LUXEMBOURG 1997-07-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Court of Justice upheld on Thursday the European Commission regulation on Community agricultural aid schemes on set-aside arable land.</p>
<p>The National Farmers Union and 120 individual farmers initiated action against Britain's Minister of Agriculture in an attempt to challenge penalites imposed by the Ministry for abuses in arable and forage land set-aside.</p>
<p>But the court said Community rules, which preclude payment of aid to farmers whose set-aside land differs by more than 20 percent from the amount declared on their approved application, is valid.</p>
<p>The court also rejected arguments that the regulation violated principles of proportionality, legal certainty and non-discrimination.</p>

<p>EXCERPTS FROM THE JUDGMENT</p>
<p>C-354/95</p>
<p>Reference for a preliminary ruling from the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division (United Kingdom) in the case pending between</p>
<p>The Queen</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</p>
<p>ex parte National Farmer's Union and Others</p>
<p>on the interpretation and validity of article 9 of Commission regulation (EEC) No 3887/92 laying down detailed rules for applying the integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes (OJ 1992 L 391, p. 36)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>THE COURT hereby rules</p>
<p>1. Article 9(2) to (4) of Commission regulation (EEC) No 3887/92 laying down detailed rules for applying the integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes, prior to the entry into force of Commission regulation (EEC) No 1648/95 must be interpreted as precluding any payment linked to the arable areas when the difference between the area of set-aside land declared and that determined on inspection by the competent authorities exceeds 20 percent and there is no false intention or serious negligence. However, in the light of articles 1(2) and 2(2) of Council regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests, under which less severe penalties introduced by subsequent amendments to Community provisions must be applied retroactively, the amendments made to article 9(4) of regulation No 3887/92 by regulation No 1648/95 apply to circumstances whch occurred before its entry into force. Consequently, the calculation of the maximum</p>
<p>2. Article 9(2) to (4) of Commission regulation (EEC) No 3887/92 must be interpreted as precluding the payment of any premium for bovine animals from farmers when the forage area as actually determined is found to be more than 20 percent smaller than that declared in the area aid applcation and there is no false intention or serious negligence.</p>
<p>3. Consideration of article 9(2) to (4) of Commission regulation (EEC) No 3887/92 has disclosed no factors of such a kind as to affect its validity in the light of the principles of proportionality, legal certainty and non-discrimination.</p>
<p>4. Consideration of regulation (EEC) No 3887/92 has disclosed no factors of such a kind as to affect the validity of article 9(2) to (4) thereof in so far as it imposes the sanction of loss of the entire payment related to a specific area on a farmer when the area of land as actually determined is found to be more thqan 20 percent smaller than that declared in the aid application and there is no false intention or serious negligence.</p>
