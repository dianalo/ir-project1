<p>Bad debts plaguing Bangladesh's banking system stem largely from political pressure, analysts said on Thursday, but some played down official warnings that the sector was on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>Commercial banks had provided fat, long-term loans to entrepreneurs under political pressure which had resulted in the outstanding debts, the analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Patronisation by political leaders in (successive) governments has resulted in huge defaulted loans,&quot; said Sharif Mohammad Afzal Hossain, president of the Bangladesh Chamber of Industries.</p>
<p>Central Bank Governor Lutfar Rahman Sarkar said on Tuesday that the &quot;country's banking system was on the verge of collapse&quot;, a warning which was repeated the next day by a government banking division official, who said the nation's banks would not be able to survive with the huge debt burden.</p>
<p>Sarkar estimated the amount of outstanding bank loans at 130 billion taka ($3 billion) and said the country did not have appropriate laws to deal with defaulters. &quot;Defaulters are taking advantage of legal loopholes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The warnings rattled the banking sector and stock market.</p>
<p>The benchmark Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) index lost 57.98 points, or 5.21 percent, to close at 1,054.07 on Wednesday on heavy investor selling. Stocks opened lower on Thursday as small investors, worried about the banking industry, dumped shares.</p>
<p>But Atiur Rahman, a research fellow with the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, said he did not believe the financial sector would collapse.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the banks are firmly footed and they are trying their best to attract new deposits and offer fresh loans to genuine new entrepreneurs,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rahman said political influence had a role in the huge unpaid loans. &quot;The loans were given...on political consideration and without checking entrepreneural capability or economic feasibility,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hossain, also a director of the state-owned Agrani Bank, told Reuters that commercial banks had an average of 40 percent of their loans in bad debt.</p>
<p>He said 80 percent of such loans were owed by big borrowers and public sector companies.</p>
<p>&quot;They are the wilful defaulters and actions should be taken against them. An immediate privatisation of public companies could be one of the solutions to the problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bangladesh spends nearly $500 million annually in subsidies to the state-owned sector.</p>
<p>Bank officials said bad loans were mostly concentrated in the industrial sector, particularly in the leather industry where about five to six billion taka ($115-$138 million) worth of credit was outstanding.</p>
<p>But Abdul Hai, secretary general of Bangladesh Tanners Association, on Thursday said companies in that sector were paying interest on loans regularly.</p>
<p>M. Taheruddin, managing director of private-sector City Bank, said his bank was not in crisis. &quot;We have some loans outstanding with the leather sector. It's not alarming.&quot;</p>
<p>Wahiduddin Mahmud, a former government economic adviser, said the &quot;accumulating problem of defaulted loans was creating an unbearable burden in the banking sector&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a problem in the banking sector and that has to be sorted out. Financial sector reforms remain (the) main hurdle in our efforts to establish a market-oriented economy,&quot; he said.</p>
