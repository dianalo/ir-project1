<p>U.S. investment strategists pared outstanding gilt positions in the first month of 1997, spooked by Bank of England calls for a half-point interest rate rise and sterling's sharp rally to four-year highs.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a little bit cautious on that market, but not so much that we have completely gotten rid of our overweight position,&quot; said Michael Faust, global portfolio manager at Bailard, Biehl and Kaiser in San Francisco.  </p>
<p>&quot;We generally like the UK, but clearly in this type of environment there is some risk in the gilt market and in sterling,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Some economists warned of a continued exodus in the coming months ahead of Britain's general election which must be held before May 22. On Monday, Britain's cabinet decided that it would aim to hold the election on May 1.</p>
<p>&quot;We think offshore investors will take profits in sterling assets as the vote gets closer and then look for a safe haven until the dust settles,&quot; said Carl Weinberg, international economist and co-author of newsletter High Frequency Economics.  </p>
<p>However, the relatively high yield of gilts and the UK's isolation from the currency and economic risk associated with proposed European monetary union makes a buy-and-hold strategy somewhat appealing, money managers said.</p>
<p>&quot;What saves this market is the notion that the yield still looks attractive relative to most everywhere else,&quot; said Richard Koss, international economist at MFR Inc.</p>
<p>Investors' major impetus to book profits in January was sterling's impressive rally to a lofty four-year high of $1.711 on January 2, strategists said.  </p>
<p>However, a Reuter poll of 16 analysts surveyed last week showed sterling will rise to $1.6427 by the end of the first quarter and hold steady at around $1.6344 until the end of the year. In late trade on Wednesday, sterling traded at $1.6210.</p>
<p>Also worrying U.S. investors was the escalating battle between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George.</p>
<p>The release on Wednesday of the latest monetary minutes showed George took the opportunity at December's monetary meeting to warn that a half-point increase in base rates may be needed early this year.  </p>
<p>&quot;Clarke focuses on manufacturing and the strong pound doesn't favor manufacturing,&quot; said Brian Gendreau, international markets strategist at JP Morgan.</p>
<p>&quot;Clarke also doesn't think the UK economy is accelerating and, in addition, he probably has a shorter time horizon than George,&quot; Gendreau said, adding he has recommended an underweight position in gilts relative to the standard portfolio benchmark since October 1996.</p>
<p>All strategists interviewed expected at least one Bank of England rate hike this year, but none foresaw a rise at least until after the general election has ended.</p>
<p>&quot;George reports to Clarke so there isn't any question over who will win,&quot; Koss said.</p>
