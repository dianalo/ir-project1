<title>UK: NWE gasoline ends firm on Elf strike, arbitrage.</title>
<headline>NWE gasoline ends firm on Elf strike, arbitrage.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE gasoline prices ended firm on Tuesday due to the twin props of the arbitrage to the U.S. and the strike by Elf refinery workers in France, traders said.</p>
<p>A 30,000 to 35,000 tonne Eurograde cargo was heard sold out of NWE to the U.S. for loading December 15-20, traders said, but this could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>Elf was also rumoured to be a small buyer of superplus and leaded material but this also was not confirmed.</p>
<p>Eurograde barges traded as high as $219 fob ARA, up $4, before ending the day at $216/$218, traders said. Rotterdam running refinery material ended at $220/$222.</p>
<p>Regular unleaded ended $1 higher at $206/$208.</p>
<p>Traders also awaited the weekly American Petroleum Institute report. U.S. traders expected gasoline inventories to rise by about 700,000 barrels.</p>
<p>Unions and managers at Elf agreed on Tuesday to concrete negotiations over pay and working conditions to try to resolve the six-day-old strike. Talks will start on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's definitely underpinning the market,&quot; said one London trader.</p>
<p>The strike has crippled a quarter of French refinery capacity and the three refineries with combined capacity of 440,000 barrels per day make up three-quarters of Elf's European refining network.</p>
<p>Analysts said Elf produces about 100,000 bpd of gasoline and feeds 60,000 bpd of that to the French market, whose gasoline demand is about 350,000 bpd.</p>
<p>In Germany, demand is satisfied and has not been significantly hit by the French strikes, a barge trader there said.</p>
<p>&quot;The consumer is well supplied and refineries are running full blast,&quot; he said.</p>
