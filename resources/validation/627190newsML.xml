<p>The German government said on Friday it was determined to press ahead with its controversial plan to revalue Bundesbank assets and rejected claims by the powerful central bank that Bonn was undermining its vaunted independence.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel, desperate to fill holes in his budget so Germany can qualify for Europe's single currency, said the government would soon pass a law to turn billions of marks in reserves at the central bank into cash.</p>
<p>Waigel warned that the parliament, and not the central bank, would have the last say on the matter.</p>
<p>&quot;The question of the valuation of the reserves, even if the Bundesbank is of the view that this should be resolved in a European context, is after all a matter for lawmakers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result, there can be no talk about an invasion into the competence or the independence of the Bundesbank.&quot;</p>
<p>But cracks emerged in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government over the issue when one Christian Democrat deputy said he would not vote for a law which the Bundesbank opposes, and another party official raised doubts that Germany would adhere to a strict interpretation of the Maastricht criteria.</p>
<p>Juergen Augustinowitz, a mild Eurosceptic and member of parliament for Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), said he would not vote for the legislation against the Bundesbank's will.</p>
<p>&quot;I will not take part in any decision in the German Bundestag (lower house of parliament) which would impair the stability of the mark or the independence and credibility of the Bundesbank,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>And Peter Mueller, a leading young ally of Kohl and head of the CDU in Saar state, urged the cash-strapped government to calm down and take a relaxed view of the Maastricht Treaty's three percent budget deficit target.</p>
<p>&quot;We have manoeuvred ourselves into a situation the treaty does not require,&quot; he said. &quot;A reasonable look at the Maastricht treaty shows there is no obligation to have a deficit of 3.0 percent. There is room to manoeuvre and we should use it.&quot;</p>
<p>Other members of Kohl's government were groping for a face-saving compromise with the Bundesbank after the central bank on Wednesday firmly rejected Bonn's plan to revalue assets to help retire old debt and qualify for European economic and monetary union (EMU) next year.</p>
<p>Leaders from the CDU and the junior coalition partners the Free Democrats (FDP) stressed repeatedly on Friday the Bundesbank supported the basic plan to revalue the reserves towards market rates and opposed only the timing.</p>
<p>&quot;We should refrain from using the word 'conflict',&quot; government spokesman Peter Hausmann said. &quot;There is no dispute about the need to revalue the reserves or about their use. The only discussion we are having is about the timing.&quot;</p>
<p>Bonn's scheme, which the Bundesbank has condemned as &quot;interference&quot; which could undermine the euro, calls for a special profit transfer to be made this year and next on the basis of the higher valuation of gold and currency reserves.</p>
<p>EU nations wanting to join the first wave of monetary union must, according to the Maastricht Treaty, have a 1997 budget deficit of no more than three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and a debt of no more than 60 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>The row drove down share prices across Europe and gave the dollar a lift on Friday against the mark, but Friday saw some signs of compromise from the central bank too.</p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke said that one way out of the dispute would be for the government to drop its demand for a payout of a special profit and leave the matter to the Bundesbank.</p>
<p>Another Bundesbank council member, Reimut Jochimsen, said the most the Bundesbank could consider was a partial revaluation in 1998, once a decision had been reached on which states launch the euro.</p>
<p>But he stressed the central bank needed total freedom up until then. &quot;The Bundesbank needs complete freedom to manoeuvre in 1997 and 1998.&quot; he told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;The lasting damage which the realisation of the gold plans would bring is far greater than the short-term financial benefit it is calculated to achieve.&quot;</p>
