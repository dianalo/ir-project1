<title>MAURITANIA: Mauritania -- bridge between Arab and black Africa.</title>
<headline>Mauritania -- bridge between Arab and black Africa.</headline>
<dateline>NOUAKCHOTT 1996-10-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mauritania, arid, impoverished and occasionally pilloried as one of the last bastions of slavery in the world, bridges Arab and black Africa.</p>
<p>A member of the Arab League and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), it won independence from France in 1960 along with a string of other French colonies.</p>
<p>Tension between black Mauritanians -- resentful at what they called Arabisation of the West African nation -- and the dominant Moorish community have coloured politics since independence.</p>
<p>Ther are further strains because of tension with Morocco over the disputed former Spanish colony in the Western Sahara and problems with Senegal over the demands of the black minority.</p>
<p>President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, a French-trained army colonel, seized power in a bloodless coup in 1984. Taya launched a democratic transition in 1991. He and the pro-government Democratic and Social Republican Party (DSRP) won 1992 elections. Six opposition parties boycotted parliamentary polls.</p>
<p>Friday's legislative election is the first test of its fledgling democracy.</p>
<p>Mauritanians irritated Western and Gulf Arab partners during the 1991 Gulf War that ended Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, by expressing sympathy with Baghdad.</p>
<p>Many prominent Mauritanians have links with the pan-Arab Baath political movement that includes Iraq's ruling party. The government has since distanced itself from Iraq and mended fences with its erstwhile allies in the Gulf.</p>
<p>The economy is based on exports of fish products and minerals, notably iron ore. It has hopes of gold production, like many other nations bordering the Sahara desert.</p>
<p>Mauritania strongly denies the existence of slavery, which it officially outlawed in 1980.</p>
<p>Following are the key facts about Mauritania:</p>
<p>POPULATION: 2.2 million (1995 U.N. figure). Two-thirds are Arabic-speaking Moors, the rest African. About a third of the people are nomadic. The official language is Arabic.</p>
<p>AREA: 1.03 million square km (398,000 square miles).</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHY: The Atlantic Ocean is to the west. Its neighbours are the disputed territory of Western Sahara (north), Algeria (north-east), Mali (east and south-east) and Senegal (south). Mauritania is generally arid, even near the coast, but the climate is tropical in the south along the Senegal River.</p>
<p>CAPITAL: Nouakchott</p>
<p>ARMED FORCES: Army - 15,000-strong. Infantry, artillery, paratroop/commando battalions, camel corps. Navy - 500-strong, seven patrol craft. Air Force - 150-strong, seven combat aircraft, no armed helicopters. Gendarmerie - 3,000-strong. National Guard - 2,000-strong + 1,000 auxiliaries. National service, two years compulsory (Source: International Institute for Strategic Studies Military Balance 1995/96).</p>
<p>ECONOMY: Currency -- Mauritanian ouguiya ($1=137 ouguiya)</p>
<p>Mauritania is a poor, arid and largely agricultural nation. Its 1995 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was $1.2 billion, per capita Gross National Product $530. The economy, boosted in the 1960s by the discovery of iron ore and copper reserves, was crippled by drought and the Western Sahara conflict. Annual growth between 1991-95 was, however, 3.1 percent. Its foreign debt in 1994 was $2.3 billion, swallowing up the equivalent of 23.3 percent of exports (Source: U.N.). Mauritania's waters are rich in fish but a 1980s fishing boom tailed off the 1990s, blamed on over-fishing and the poor state of the fleet. Iron ore remains a mainstay of the economy. Agriculture, including millet, dates, potatoes and maize, is largely confined to the south in the Senegal river valley. Droughts often devastate livestock herds and hit farm output.</p>
<p>HISTORY: Mauritania won independence from France on November 28, 1960 against the will of Morocco which claimed sovereignty. The first president, Moktar Ould Daddah, proclaimed a one-party state in 1964. The Spanish Western Sahara was split between Morocco and Mauritania in 1976. Algerian-backed Polisario guerrillas raided Nouakchott in 1976. France helped Mauritania with air support. The war was unpopular at home. Mauritania relinquished any claim to the Western Sahara, one year after a bloodless military coup in 1978. Morocco took over its share. Lieutenant-Colonel Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla, who became president in 1980, recognised the Polisario Front's self-proclaimed Saharan Arab Democratic Republic in 1984. Taya, sacked as prime minister, ousted Haidalla in 1984 while he was abroad, accusing him of encouraging tribalism and corruption. He adopted a more neutral stance on Western Sahara. Ethnic divisions persisted and in 1989 led to friction with Senegal and killings of each other's migrant nationals. Mauritania accused Senegal of backing a coup. By 1991, relative calm had returned. Taya launched democratic reforms. He won a six-year term as president in 1992. The DSRP won 67 of parliament's 79 seats.</p>
