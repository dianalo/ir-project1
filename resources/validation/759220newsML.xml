<headline>UK's Blair - interest rate rises had been overdue.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-07-29</dateline>

<p>Prime Minister Tony Blair said &quot;serious inflationary problems&quot; had faced the British economy as a result of the failure of the previous government to act on interest rates.</p>
<p>Interest rates have been raised three times since Labour swept to power in a landslide election victory on May 1 but Blair pinned the blame for the rises on the former Conservative government.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rates have gone up because of what happened a year ago, not because of what's happening now, and that is very frustrating for us,&quot; Blair told The Mirror newspaper in an interview published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Labour government has given the Bank of England independence to set interest rates, which Blair said would prevent such problems in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rates have had to go up because the right decisions were not taken six or nine months ago and what is essential for the long-term strength of the country's economy is that interest rate decisions are not taken for short-term political expediency but for sound economic reasons,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Blair said higher rates had to be used to &quot;squeeze the inflation out&quot; of the economy. He said that Labour had &quot;solved&quot; Britain's budget deficit problem and that the country would be out of debt in two or three years.</p>
<p>Base rates stand at 6.75 percent and there is speculation that they could be raised again when the Bank of England's monetary policy committee meets next month.</p>
