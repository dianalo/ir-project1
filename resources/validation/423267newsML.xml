<p>Celtic knocked holders Rangers out of the Scottish Cup with a comprehensive 2-0 quarter-final win over their oldest and bitterest rivals at Parkhead on Thursday.</p>
<p>Celtic fully deserved the victory, their first in 10 Old Firm meetings, and are now favourites to extend their number of record victories in the final to 31. They last won the cup in 1995.</p>
<p>Roared on by the vast majority of a 50,000 crowd Celtic were on the offensive from the start.</p>
<p>The opening goal came after 10 minutes when defender Malky Mackay reached a Paolo Di Canio corner before Andy Goram and saw his header fly into the unprotected net.</p>
<p>It was the first goal Goram had conceded to Celtic in more than six hours' play.</p>
<p>Injury-hit Rangers, clearly missing the calming influence of stalwart defender Richard Gough, were disorganised at the back as Celtic continued to pour forward.</p>
<p>Celtic went 2-0 up after Portuguese striker Jorge Cadete raced Swede Joachim Bjorklund for a long Tosh McKinlay ball and went down theatrically to win a penalty which the Italian Di Canio calmly converted.</p>
<p>Two more penalty appeals were turned down as Celtic kept up the pressure.</p>
<p>Alan Stubbs headed over the bar from close range but it proved immaterial as Rangers were unable to muster any real threat.</p>
<p>The two sides meet again in 10 days in a league match that could go a long way towards deciding the destination of the premier division title.</p>
<p>Rangers, who did the double last season, currently have a five point lead in their bid to win the title for a ninth successive season to equal the record Celtic set from 1966-74.</p>
