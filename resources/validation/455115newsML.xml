<p>Little over a year ago Albania seemed a relatively safe bet in a Balkan region ravaged by war and political instability.</p>
<p>Now, Europe's poorest country is mired in political and economic chaos just as the hard-won peace in former Yugoslavia holds out a fragile hope of renewal for its neighbours.</p>
<p>Western investment in Albania, estimated at a modest $250 million from 1992 to 1996, has all but dried up since January when violent insurrections flared in the south, later spreading north and even briefly engulfing the capital.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously there has been a serious change in the distribution of power. This is just the beginning of a troublesome and unstable phase,&quot; said Vladimir Gligorov, Albania expert at the Vienna Institute for Comparative Studies.</p>
<p>Tirana's Rinasi airport, its single runway under reconstruction by Siemens AG with the aid of a 48 million mark ($28.3 million) soft credit from Germany, closed to traffic last week, forcing foreign nationals to flee by boat and military helicopter.</p>
<p>Even before the interruption to flights a steady trickle of would-be investors had been replaced by planeloads of journalists, arriving to report on the latest unrest.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a serious disturbance. The whole political system has to be reformed -- and not just by having an agreement. That is an interim solution,&quot; onr international analyst said.</p>
<p>The catalyst for the violence was the collapse of a series of fraudulent pyramid investment schemes at the start of the year.</p>
<p>Economists believe Albanians might have sunk up to $2 billion in the shady schemes. They say the state, strapped for cash, has no hope of repaying investors without printing money and in doing so stoking hyper-inflation.</p>
<p>Amid mounting tension, the ruling rightist Democratic Party agreed earlier this month to give way to a &quot;government of national unity&quot;, including the former communists. But insurgents, armed with looted guns, have set their sights on President Sali Berisha's resignation.</p>
<p>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK HAD BEEN IMPROVING UNTIL PYRAMIDS CRASHED</p>
<p>Albania's economic problems had been serious before the unrest, but the government was at least trying to implement reforms.</p>
