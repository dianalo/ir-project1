<p>The International Monetary Fund is still not happy with Russian revenue collections and plans to hold up another disbursement of its three-year $10 billion loan to Russia, retiring U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Thomas Pickering said Thursday.</p>
<p>Pickering, speaking to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said, however, that the Russian government is very serious about meeting the IMF targets and will make a major effort this month to do that.  </p>
<p>On Wednesday, Russian central bank head Sergei Dubinin told Reuters Financial Television in Paris &quot;Our chances to receive the new tranche are better in November than October.&quot;</p>
<p>Disbursements have been held up after Russia failed to meet IMF targets on tax collection.</p>
<p>Dubinin said the IMF was helping Russia solve what he described as a key problem and declined to confirm that negotiations with the IMF were particularly difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;The negotiations with any team from the IMF are professional. The idea is to increase the tax collection in Russia. This is a key problem,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Earlier he told a bankers' conference he was convinced tax collection targets would be met.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that the monthly examination in November will be passed and we will be able to met these objectives, and therefore the (IMF) tranches will be paid in time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said it was in Russia's interest to ensure good tax collection, adding &quot;We must ensure resources for our budget.&quot;</p>
<p>Moscow would make a major effort in the months ahead to improve tax collection, through administrative and police action if necessary. &quot;We are going to adopt much stricter rules on tax collection,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Pickering said &quot;I'm disappointed that an IMF mission which just finished an early examination -- the real major examination will come at the end of this month --  is still not satisfied witht the level of revenue collection so the revenue collection target has defeated the capacity -- at least for the moment -- for the IMF to disburse another important tranche in the long-term stabilisation fund loan on which Russia is counting.&quot;</p>
<p>He described this as &quot;agonizing&quot; for Russia's economy because there are serious arrearages in wages and pensions in many sectors.  </p>
<p>But Pickering said that &quot;my own view is the Russians are very serious about moving back to the IMF targets, that they are going to make a major effort to do that before the end of November, ... that the critical point that they must do that is before the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Pickering, who recently left his post in Moscow, predicted the IMF would be &quot;strict in keeping things on target but ... they are going to also work hard to try to assist the Russians with expert advice on precisely how to going about doing this.&quot;  </p>
<p>The dangers of Russia not getting the IMF loan &quot;are real in the sense that social dislocation for many people in Russia is just around the corner,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The good news is they have increased revenue collection. The bad news is -- not enough,&quot; Pickering said.</p>
<p>The economy is struggling with a paralysing shortage of cash -- the government is unable to pay its bills while firms are unable to pay taxes and bills to each other, leading to a huge secondary economy based on barter trade.  </p>
<p>The IMF has already delayed handing over one tranche of the loan because it was worried about low tax revenues.</p>
<p>Pickering, an avowed optimist on Russia, said that despite the problem, &quot;the economy looks pretty good in the long-term.&quot;</p>
<p>In Moscow Thursday, a top minister said Russia may have to run the risk of displeasing its international creditors in order to pay millions of dollars in overdue pensions.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation with debts for pensions is so serious that it seems we may have to go ahead with a decision that might not please certain international monetary organisations,&quot; First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Ilyushin said.</p>
<p>&quot;In principle, it's all the same to destitute pensioners whether inflation is one percent or three percent,&quot; he told the Federation Council upper house of parliament.</p>
<p>IMF representatives arrive in Moscow Thursday for talks on paying out the latest delayed tranche of the $10 billion loan.</p>
<p>The government has succeeded in bringing monthly inflation down to 1.2 percent a month in October. The annual increase in consumer prices slowed to a record low 27.2 percent in the year to October from 31.7 percent in the year to September.</p>
<p>But part of the cost of that austerity has been a failure to make budgeted payments to pensioners and state employees.</p>
