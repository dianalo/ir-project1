<p>A fragile truce between supporters of President Pascal Lissouba and his predecessor held in the Congo Republic capital Brazzaville on Wednesday ahead of possible peace talks, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Brazzaville residents and aid workers said the truce that began at midnight on Monday was &quot;more or less respected&quot; despite the occasional &quot;very, very sporadic&quot; burst of shooting.</p>
<p>Of numerous ceasefires declared since the bloody showdown between Lissouba and former military leader Denis Sassou Nguesso started June 5, not one has been strictly adhered to.</p>
<p>Mohamed Sahnoun, the U.N. and Organisation for African Unity special envoy who met both sides in Brazzaville on Tuesday, said afterwards representatives of both sides could meet in Gabon's capital Libreville late Thursday or early Friday.</p>
<p>Gabonese President Omar Bongo is the international mediator in the conflict, which began after soldiers surrounded Sassou's home as part of a crackdown on private militias.</p>
<p>Sahnoun has said the aim is to secure conditions to enable a presidential election, planned for July 27 but postponed, to be held within the next two months. Plans for a U.N.-sponsored mainly African peace force are taking shape.</p>
<p>Medical workers say the political and ethnic clashes have killed hundreds of people in the capital of the oil-producing former French colony, many of them civilians.</p>
<p>French troops evacuated almost 6,000 foreign nationals.</p>
