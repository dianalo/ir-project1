<headline>Strong U.S. data reignites dlr at European close.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-30</dateline>

<p>The dollar closed higher in Europe, boosted by U.S. economic data showing robust growth and an acceleration in prices in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Dealers scurried to buy dollars on news of a 5.6 percent rise in GDP in the fourth quarter, the fastest pace in over nine years and well above economists' forecast for a 4.1 percent increase. The dollar pushed above 1.73 marks and close to its overnight high at 127 yen after the release.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though GDP data are backward-looking this came as a surprise and the Fed will take notice,&quot; said Francis Breedon, foreign exchange strategist at Lehman Brothers in London.  </p>
<p>A 2.7 percent rise in the GDP price index, the highest since the first quarter of 1995, added fuel to the dollar's spurt.</p>
<p>&quot;The data gives the Fed a further reason to tighten credit,&quot; said Breedon.</p>
<p>Today's data added weight to speculation that the Fed would increase rates again at the next meeting of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee on May 20.</p>
<p>&quot;All it needs now is a set of strong jobs data on Friday, and the dollar is off to the races,&quot; said a senior trader at a German bank in London, referring to U.S. non-farm payroll data due for release on Friday.  </p>
<p>At 1630 GMT the dollar was at 1.7315/25 marks and 126.90/98 yen, up from 1.7225/30 and 126.71/81 in late Europe on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The GDP data showed a strong pick-up from 3.8 percent in the previous quarter but economists cautioned that a large chunk of the rise was due to an increase in inventories, which grew at $46.1 billion rate, compared with $17.4 billion in the final quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>The Irish pound slid to its lowest level against sterling since July 1992 after a run on the currency amid rumours that the Irish central bank stopped supporting the punt late on Tuesday after heavy intervention early this week.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the slide was one of the clearest signals yet that markets expect currencies starting European monetary union will be fixed at their central rates in the European exchange rate mechanism.</p>
<p>Even though the punt dropped over three percent against the mark on Wednesday, it is still over 18 pfennigs above its ERM parity of 2.4111 marks.</p>
<p>The Irish pound was at 2.5983/98 marks in late trading, off a low at 2.5748, and compared with 2.6705 in late Europe on Tuesday. Against sterling it was at 0.9230/70 versus 0.9485 at the previous close.</p>
<p>Sterling, meanwhile, kept to familiar ranges one day before the UK election. Sterling/mark was at 2.8060/70 marks from 2.8109/19 at the previous close here. Against the dollar it was at $1.6204/14 from $1.6290/00.</p>
