<p>The battle for China's beer market is brutal and will end in a bloodbath, Singapore's Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd (APB) said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;China competition is very intense with over 800 breweries and over 60 international beer joint ventures,&quot; chief executive officer Koh Poh Tiong told analysts and reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;There is going to be a bloodbath in China. Every major brewery is facing the problem of low contributions. It is going to be very difficult, very intense,&quot; Koh said at a briefing on APB's results for the six months to March 31, 1997.</p>
<p>It would be a long time before APB broke even on its investments in China, Koh said.</p>
<p>Losses before interest and tax from China for the first half sagged to S$6.68 million (US$4.7 million) from S$5.62 million loss in the same period of the previous year. The group's first half pre-tax profit was S$90.06 million,</p>
<p>APB posted a 14.4 percent rise in net profit to Singapore $49.46 million for the first-half 1997.</p>
<p>It said the earnings were boosted by good results in Singapore, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia and Thailand.</p>
<p>The gains were partly offset by lower profits in Vietnam due to higher depreciation costs and currency devaluations and the start-up losses in Cambodia where a new brewery was commissioned in October 1996.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement accompanying its results that said second-half profits would be significantly lower than the same period a year ago due to start-up losses at its brewery on the Chinese island of Hainan and one in Cambodia.</p>
<p>Koh said overhead costs from its US$34 million Cambodian investment could be &quot;easily recovered in a year or two&quot; but he was not too optimistic about Hainan, where APB invested US$64 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Hainan has a higher overhead. It will be more difficult to recover because of the intense competition from China and lower contributions from low retail prices,&quot; Koh said.</p>
<p>The group already has over 50 percent market share in Cambodia, where only one other brewery is operating. Cambodia's beer contribution is the group's third largest after Singapore.</p>
<p>US$1 = S$1.42</p>
