<p>The right of health care for all is written into South Africa's post-apartheid constitution, but the country's grand aims face serious problems -- and are making enemies.</p>
<p>Crippled by minimal investment during decades of white rule, many rural black areas and rundown shanty towns have only the most basic of facilities.</p>
<p>Now the country is free from the shackles of state-sponsored racism, the focus is on providing a basic level of primary health care for all.</p>
<p>The problem is paying for it.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't have enough money to deal with all of the problems that we want to address,&quot; said Health Ministry spokesman Vincent Hlongwane.</p>
<p>He pointed to the results of a recent forensic audit into the state of the country's hospitals.</p>
<p>A team of accounting detectives concluded that up to 10 billion rand ($2.22 billion) might be needed to repair or rebuild the hospitals. Added to that was another two billion rand needed for equipment.</p>
<p>&quot;This should be done within eight years. If we don't do it within eight years, then some of the hospitals in quite good shape now will not be in the future,&quot; Hlongwane said.</p>
<p>The current year's budget has pencilled in only 20.2 billion rand for the entire expenditure of the health department.</p>
<p>Apart from past neglect, South Africa is also not immune to the diseases that blight Africa more than any other continent.</p>
<p>Latest figures show that 2.4 million people in South Africa, including 14 percent of its pregnant women, are infected with the AIDS virus.</p>
<p>Coupled with this is a resurgence of the lung disease tuberculosis (TB) -- a potential killer that often goes in hand in hand with AIDS.</p>
<p>FIGHTING TB A NATIONAL PRIORITY</p>
<p>Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma has declared fighting TB a national priority, warning it could hit 3.5 million people in South Africa in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Money is needed to bear these burdens and Zuma has placed a strong emphasis on saving cash.</p>
<p>South African medical wages, especially in rural clinics, are much lower than in more developed countries and many locally trained doctors have moved abroad.</p>
<p>In order to combat the personnel shortage without raising costs, South Africa has imported more than 300 Cuban medics to staff its clinics.</p>
<p>The move has attracted controversy, with newspapers full of angry letters claiming the Cubans are not fully trained and may be more likely to harm than heal.</p>
<p>Zuma, a regular target of opposition resignation calls, has not helped her own cause with a series of gaffes.</p>
<p>About 10.5 million rand of European Union funding was spent on a flop Broadway-style AIDS awareness play and Zuma recently said AIDS spread faster because poor people could not afford forms of recreation other than sex.</p>
<p>DRUG MOVES ANGER GLOBAL INDUSTRY</p>
<p>But more serious political ripples have emanated from legislative reforms now before parliament that seek to change the way drugs are prescribed.</p>
<p>One concerns the promotion of generic substitutes over brand name drugs. Generics are cheaper versions of branded medicines whose patents have expired.</p>
<p>The draft legislation states: &quot;A pharmacist shall...dispense a therapeutically equivalent medicine instead of the medicine prescribed...unless expressly forbidden to do so.&quot;</p>
<p>The industry says that amounts to mandatory substitution of its branded products -- drugs that may have cost hundreds of millions of dollars to research and develop.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no problem with generic competition, but there should be choice. Why do you need to mandate it?&quot; said Mirryena Deeb, chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association.</p>
<p>But the health ministry says the patient has been given the right to know that a cheaper alternative exists.</p>
<p>&quot;We are putting in place legislation that will not make generic substitution compulsory, but will make people aware that there is a cheaper solution that is equally effective,&quot; Hlongwane said.</p>
<p>DRUGS INDUSTRY PREPARED TO SHOP AROUND</p>
<p>Another proposal is the &quot;parallel importation&quot; of drugs from overseas if they are cheaper.</p>
<p>The drugs industry says it has no problem with shopping around for medicines, but warns that drugs should be brought into the country only if they face the same strict safety tests and registration procedures as locally made products -- with the attendant extra costs.</p>
<p>The proposals now have cabinet approval and will move to be discussed in parliament.</p>
<p>Trade Minister Alec Erwin said the legislation reflected South Africa's &quot;very clear decision that it is our intention to be a country of best practice&quot; in the recognition of trademarks and intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>But Deeb, fresh from a European trip to meet pharmaceutical executives, warned that South Africa may still lose foreign investment as multinationals seek friendlier environments for their products.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a concern from the international pharmaceuticals community about the commitment of South Africa to market principles and my great fear is that they...will just leave. It could be a tragedy,&quot; she said.</p>
