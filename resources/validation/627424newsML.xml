<headline>Reuters to highlight key 37 French constituencies.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Several centre-right ministers and the mayor of Paris could lose their parliamentary seats in the decisive second round of a French election on Sunday, analysts say.</p>
<p>Reuters will carry highlight coverage of the results in 37 key constituencies involving party leaders, ministers or key outsiders.</p>
<p>Outgoing Prime Minister Alain Juppe, who faces a challenge from Socialist Gilles Savary in Bordeaux, is among ministers considered at risk by some experts. The extreme-right National Front has urged supporters to vote against Juppe.</p>
<p>The heavyweight champion belatedly put forward to succeed Juppe if the centre-right wins, outgoing National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin, should keep his seat without difficulty in Epinal, in eastern France.</p>
<p>Other government figures in trouble include Justice Minister Jacques Toubon, Employment Minister Anne-Marie Couderc and Environment Minister Corinne Lepage in Paris and Urban Affairs Minister Eric Raoult in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, where former security minister Robert Pandraud is also in difficulty.</p>
<p>The capital's Gaullist mayor, Jean Tiberi, under a cloud over sleaze scandals since taking over at city hall from President Jacques Chirac in 1995, could lose his parliamentary seat to Socialist challenger Lyne Cohen-Solal.</p>
<p>Tiberi, re-elected hands-down since 1968, may face pressure to resign as mayor if, as some experts predict, the Socialist party captures a majority of Paris seats. It only held two in the outgoing National Assembly.</p>
<p>One Gaullist who seems certain to hold his Paris seat is former prime minister Edouard Balladur. Centrist UDF general secretary Claude Goasguen should also win his constituency in the capital.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing suffered the indignity of being forced into a runoff for the first time by ecologist Danielle Auroi but is likely to retain his seat.</p>
<p>Among other coalition figures, Gaullist RPR party general secretary Jean-Francois Mancel has a fight to hold his seat in the Oise district, although the leaders of the UDF, the junior coalition party, Francois Leotard and Francois Bayrou are both expected to win re-election comfortably.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre seems sure of winning a seat in the Eure district west of Paris, as do free-marketeering former finance minister Alain Madelin and anti-Maastricht rightist Philippe de Villiers in the western Vendee region.</p>
<p>The likely candidate for prime minister if the left wins, Socialist party leader Lionel Jospin, is assured of an easy win in Cintegabelle, near the southwestern city of Toulouse.</p>
<p>Socialist spokesman Francois Hollande is hoping to capture a seat in Gaullist President Jacques Chirac's fief of Correze in central France. Other Socialists who seem sure of returning to parliament are economic expert Dominique Strauss-Kahn, former culture minister Jack Lang and outgoing Socialist floor leader Laurent Fabius, a former prime minister.</p>
<p>The Socialists hope to bring a bevy of women politicians into the Assembly, including Strasbourg mayor Catherine Trautmann, former labour minister Martine Aubry and former environment minister Segolene Royal.</p>
<p>One prominent Socialist, former European affairs minister Elisabeth Guigou, is far from certain of a seat. She is running against the Gaullist mayor of Avignon, Marie-Josee Roig, in a triangular race with a National Front candidate.</p>
<p>Communist party leader Robert Hue seems sure to enter the Assembly for the first time from the Paris suburb of Argenteuil, and Communist floor leader Alain Bocquet should keep his seat in the north.</p>
<p>Anti-Maastricht former defence minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, tipped by some sources for a cabinet job if the left wins, seems sure to keep his seat in eastern Belfort.</p>
<p>The environmentalist Greens, allied with the Socialists, seem set to win their first parliamentary seats. Party leader Dominique Voynet, spokesman Guy Hascoet and former television newscaster Noel Mamere are all in close races.</p>
<p>The extreme-right National Front won nearly 15 percent of the first round vote but is not certain of winning any seats.</p>
<p>Its best prospects appear to be the mayors of Toulon and Orange, Jean-Marie Le Chevallier and Jacques Bompard, the party's number two Bruno Megret, its number three Bruno Gollisch and party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen's daughter, Marie-Caroline, in the tough Paris suburb of Mantes-la-Jolie.</p>
