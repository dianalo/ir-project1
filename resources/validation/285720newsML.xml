<p>U.S. refiners seemed reluctant to take North Sea crude cargoes on offer Friday amid slim downstream margins, traders said.</p>
<p>The spread between February West Texas Intermediate and North Sea Brent was around $1.50-55 a barrel late Friday, up around five cents from late Thursday, maintaining the open trans-Atlantic arbitrage.</p>
<p>Several Wall Street players are offering Brent cargoes for early February arrival to the Gulf Coast at February West Texas Intermediate minus 25 cents, trade sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's got to be at least 40 cents (under WTI) to get our attention,&quot; one refiner said.</p>
<p>The open arbitrage and slim margins, meanwhile, have taken a toll on other regional crudes, such as Colombia's Cusiana.</p>
<p>British Petroleum sold a 550,000 barrel cargo of Cusiana to a Gulf Coast refiner for delivery January 23-24 at a premium of 10 cents to March WTI, traders said.</p>
<p>Before Christmas, Cusiana was fetching a premium of around 40 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>BP has a second cargo on offer for January 31 to February 1 at around the same price, trade sources said.</p>
<p>In other Latin American activity, Uruguay's state-owned oil company ANCAP bought asphaltic crude for delivery February 12-14 in a private spot transaction with Venezuela, trade sources said.</p>
<p>ANCAP bought BCF-24 crude from Lagoven, a unit of state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, they said.</p>
<p>The cargo of around 500,000 barrels will load between January 30 and February 2, they said.</p>
<p>Traders speculated that ANCAP paid around $5.00 a barrel under benchmark West Texas Intermediate for the cargo.</p>
<p>Uruguay normally buys around one million barrels a year of such crude for asphalt, and has previously bought heavy Saudi and Iranian crudes, traders said.</p>
<p>In the U.S. aftermarket, a series of partial February Brent cargoes changed hands at $24.18 and 24.20 a barrel, up nine to 11 cents from the IPE settlement.</p>
<p>Intermonth spreads were also stronger. Feb/Mar Brent traded at 52/53 cents, up four to five cents from the London close.</p>
