<title>USA: Great Lakes Aviation loss widens, sees charge.</title>
<headline>Great Lakes Aviation loss widens, sees charge.</headline>
<dateline>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. 1997-03-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Great Lakes Aviation Ltd said Monday its net loss for the fourth quarter and all of 1996 widened, adding it expects to take a substantial charge that will further impact that loss.</p>
<p>Based on preliminary information, Great Lakes said it had a net loss of $6.4 million or $0.84 a share, compared to a year-ago loss of $500,000 or $0.06 a share. Its loss for the year was $11.3 million or $1.49 a share, compared with a loss of $2.7 million or $0.35 a share in 1995.</p>
<p>The fourth quarter and full year of 1995 include a gain of $3.9 million on the sale of slots at Chicago's O'Hare Airport.  </p>
<p>Losses for the fourth quarter of 1996 were greater than anticipated due principally to flight cancellations because of severe weather conditions in the upper Midwest, increased fuel prices and unanticipated turnover in flight personnel stemming from hiring by a major carrier.</p>
<p>Great Lakes also said it expects to incur a substantial charge to write down to estimated net realizable value its spare parts inventory. This charge will increase the fourth quarter and full-year 1996 net losses.</p>
<p>During the 1996 fourth quarter, the company returned three Beechcraft 1900C aircraft as part of a fleet reorganization.  </p>
<p>Approximately $1.2 million was spent on early engine overhauls as a part of the lease return conditions, it added. In addition, the company said, it plans to return three additional aircraft in the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>The company believes it has spare parts inventory in excess of its requirements. Certain spares have been sold and efforts to reduce this inventory continue, it added.</p>
<p>Great Lakes Aviation said that, due to its recent losses, it is experiencing liquidity difficulties. It is in talks with its principal creditor, which is also its primary aicraft supplier, and certain other creditors.  </p>
<p>Discussions with creditors are ongoing, and there can be no assurance that such negotiations will be successful, the company said. It added it expects the report of its independent public accountants for fiscal 1996 will include a &quot;going concern&quot; qualification.</p>
<p>Great Lakes said these losses have resulted in a violation of a financial covenant contained in an agreement under which it leases two of its Brasilia aicraft. The company added it is not current on certain vendor accounts and scheduled lease and debt payments, and has received a notice of default concerning non-payment of obligations related to a short-term lease under which it operates two of its Brasilia aircraft.</p>
<p>Great Lakes said there are also disagreements about interpretation of certain terms continued in the latter agreement.</p>
