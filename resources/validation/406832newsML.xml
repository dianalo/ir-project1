<p>A British widow claimed victory in a lengthy legal battle by winning the right on Thursday to try to have a baby using her late husband's sperm.</p>
<p>Britain's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) decided to allow Diane Blood, 32, to export her husband Stephen's sperm, frozen since his death, to Belgium for treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;It must be right that people should control the destiny of their own genetic material,&quot; said HFEA chairwoman Ruth Deech.</p>
<p>Blood was delighted by the outcome of a case that became a cause celebre in Britain. &quot;This is obviously wonderful, wonderful news. I am very, very relieved,&quot; she told a news conference. &quot;I am sure that Stephen would be very happy.&quot;</p>
<p>The sperm, being stored in a hospital in northern England, will be taken to Brussels where doctors say they are willing to give her in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment.</p>
<p>The HFEA initially ruled in November that the sperm could not be used because Stephen Blood had not given his written permission before he died of meningitis in 1995.</p>
<p>The appeal court overturned the ruling earlier this month when three judges said that while insemination would be illegal in Britain, it could be carried out in Belgium.</p>
<p>The HFEA, which was then asked to rule that there were no public policy objections before the treatment could be carried out, said it would allow the export of the sperm.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the only way to resolve the tragic situation for Mrs Blood, one that will not arise again. It has never been the the HFEA's wish to upset her in any way and I'm sure she understands there were very important principles we had to uphold,&quot; Deech said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is now for the clinic storing the sperm to satisfy itself that the clinic in Brussels considers the welfare of any child that may be born.&quot;</p>
<p>HFEA officials said Blood would be treated at the Academish Ziekenhuis Universiteit, a part of the Brussels Centre for Reproductive Medicine.</p>
<p>The authority said it had always insisted on the principle of written consent and emphasised that &quot;this is an exceptional case which the court assured cannot recur.&quot;</p>
<p>In their ruling, the appeal court judges noted that a similar case would not be possible in future because under English law Blood's sperm should not have been preserved because he had not given his written permission.</p>
<p>Deech said the HFEA deliberated for 90 minutes before reaching its decision, but had already spent &quot;many months, many days, many hours on this. Every angle has been explored.&quot;</p>
<p>Under British law, Blood's dead husband will not be reagrded as the legal father of any child and there will be a blank space on the birth certificate where the father's name should be.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't imagine that that will be of much practical concern to her,&quot; said Deech.</p>
