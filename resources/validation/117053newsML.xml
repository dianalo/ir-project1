<p>Middle Eastern and North African countries (MENA) should sharply increase their infrastructure investments by raising private sector involvement to attain rapid growth, country ministers and officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ministers from MENA contries and officials from the World Bank and European Union gathered in Istanbul for a three-day seminar held by the World Bank on &quot;Growth and Public-Private Investments on Infrastructure in the Middle East and North Africa&quot; conference.</p>
<p>&quot;MENA region should aim to double its growth rate to an average of six percent a year over the years to 2010. To achieve this, there is a need for infrastructure,&quot; said Kemal Dervis, Vice President of the World Bank's MENA department.</p>
<p>Noting that current infrastructure endowment was currently inadequate, Dervis said the investment required to achieve this would need to be provided in part by domestic and overseas private companies.</p>
<p>&quot;Getting the private sector involved, requires new public-private partnership for this purpose, fostered by new roles for governments and their supporters in international financial institutions,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Abdelatif Al-Hamad, chairman of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, said socio-economic problems haunting MENA countries, like high deficits, population growth rates, migration from rural to urbanised areas and environmental pollution hindered infrastructure investments which were &quot;the wheels of the economic activity&quot;.</p>
<p>Ministers from Morocco, Palestine, Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, Tunisia and Algeria who attended the conference, shared views that infrastructure investments were key for future development in the region and the load should be transferred to the private sector from the public sector.</p>
<p>&quot;There are new realities in the region. Building peace involves a comprehensive cooperation. Cooperation cannot be succesfull unless we have infrastructure network not only in the country, but also among the neighbouring countries,&quot; said Rima Khalaf Hunaidi, Jordan's Minister of Planning.</p>
<p>Hunaidi said her country was pursuing private sector for infrastructure investments while keeping its leader role in planning and regulating them.</p>
<p>&quot;The governments must be transparent and consistent to cultivate a closer partnership with the private sector. But on the other hand, the private sector should stop relying on government support,&quot; she said.</p>
