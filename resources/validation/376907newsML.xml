<p>Swedish steel group SSAB said on Thursday low steel prices and a strong crown hit its 1996 result and future profit development would hinge on steel prices.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1997, prices were around the same level as during the fourth quarter of 1996 which was five percent lower than average prices in 1996, the company said.</p>
<p>Following the weak market and the stronger crown, the company reported a 45 percent drop in 1996 profit after financial items to 2.09 billion crowns ($282.2 million).</p>
<p>Sales fell to 17.41 billion crowns from 19.00 billion crowns. Operating profit after depreciation declined to 1.66 billion crowns, from 3.48 billion crowns and earnings per share fell to 11.60 crowns from 21.30 crowns.</p>
<p>Still, the company proposed an unchanged dividend of four crowns a share as its policy is to adjust dividends to earnings over an economic cycle.</p>
<p>In 1996, it invested 2.86 billion crowns, compared with 2.36 billion crowns a year earlier. Over three years, the company will invest around five billion crowns, mainly to strengthen its profile as a special steel company.</p>
<p>Steel operations' productivity improved last year with the number of man hours per tonne decreasing to 3.4 from 3.5. The company also cut costs.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite larger volumes in the steel operations the increase in manufacturing costs could thereby be limited to two percent,&quot; the company said.</p>
