<headline>Licht sees world, U.S. HFS output rising in 1996/9.</headline>

<p>World production of high fructose syrup (HFS) is expected to rise to 10.24 million tonnes dry basis in 1996/97 from 9.82 million in 1995/96, analyst F.O. Licht said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The United States, the world's leading HFS producer, would turn out 7.58 million tonnes in 1996/97, compared with 7.36 million the previous year.  </p>
<p>In the latest edition of its International Sugar and Sweetener Report, Licht said HFS production advanced by 22.3 percent from 1992/93 to 1996/97, compared with the 11.7 percent seen in the sugar sector.</p>
<p>But the solid growth rate could not conceal the fact that U.S. manufacturers were having a hard time after years of prosperity and success, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite growing three percent in 1996/97, the industry is in deep trouble,&quot; the Licht report said.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the star performer of the U.S. food industry, HFS production has lost its shine for many players and the industry is about to enter a decisive restructuring phase.&quot;  </p>
<p>Licht said Japan, the third largest HFS producer worldwide, would turn out 798,000 tonnes in 1996/97 and just up from the 789,000 reported for the previous year.</p>
<p>It added that the Asian HFS market seemed to have reached a high level of saturation in many countries of the region after a very promising start in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>HFS output in Asia's three leading producers -- Japan, South Korea and Taiwan -- had remained at a high level without stirring too much excitement, it said.</p>
<p>Mexican HFS production was expected to rise sharply, and output was pegged at 120,000 tonnes after just 25,000 in 1995/96.</p>
<p>In the European Union, where output was effectively constrained by production quotas, HFS production was expected to rise to 302,863 tonnes in 1996/97 from 297,766 in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Licht said HFS production was also making good progress in central and eastern Europe, noting new projects announced in Slovakia, Turkey and Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;Although small by U.S. standards, the new operations could mean increased competition for sucrose in the highly lucrative market for liquid sweeteners,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Given rapid growth for soft drink consumption in the region, the outlook for HFS production is rather favourable.&quot;</p>
<p>Hungary was one of the region's leading HFS producers and output would rise to 130,000 tonnes from 117,000.</p>
