<p>Prequalifier Ronnie McCann shot a seven-under-par 65 to lead the Dimension Data Pro-Am by two shots on Thursday, deflecting some attention away from the continuing struggles of Seve Ballesteros.</p>
<p>McCann, born in South Africa, but resident in the U.S., was one of six players who made the tournament the hard way, and he came in late in the day with a storming five under par 31 on the back nine at the Lost City to take sole possession of the lead.</p>
<p>In total contrast, former two-time Million Dollar Challenge winner Ballesteros found himself at the opposite end of the field after a disastrous 10-over- par round of 82.</p>
<p>At one stage Ballesteros' score looked likely to be two shots worse as he was among a group of players who were initially penalised for riding carts on the course.</p>
<p>But officials relented when they realised the players had been given lifts at the behest on on-course officials in an attempt to speed up play on a course noted for its long hauls between green and tee.</p>
<p>The tournament is being played over two courses for the first two days before the weekend cut of both amateurs and professionals.</p>
<p>McCann's score was made at the easier Lost City layout, where former world number one Nick Price carded a 67, but the round of the day probably belonged to Italian Ryder Cup player Costantino Rocca, whose 67 was two shots better than anyone else managed on the Gary Player Country Club course.</p>
<p>Rocca set up his score in his first five holes, four of which he birdied on his way to an outward loop of 33. He came home in 34 and has a distinct advantage over the field with his next round to be played at Lost City.</p>
<p>Defending champion Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe shot a one under par 71 at Country Club.</p>
