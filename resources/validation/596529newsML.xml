<p>Singapore gas oil swaps rose slightly at midday on Monday despite a large hike to crude prices on Friday as lacklustre regional demand kept a lid on any big gains, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market rose this morning because of crude but sentiment remains bearish. Regional demand is still not that strong,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>June swaps were last quoted at $25.60/$25.70 per barrel, up 30 cents from Thursday, while July was indicated at $25.25/$25.33, also up 30 cents.  </p>
<p>June swaps traded earlier in the day three times at $25.65, brokers said.</p>
<p>The swaps market was pushed up slightly after crude recorded another big increase on Friday with July Brent rising 86 cents to close at $20.35 per barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.</p>
<p>Traders said the market remains well supported at current levels and the firmer crude prices will give some traders a good base to raise their physical bids.  </p>
<p>On Friday, three 150,000 barrel cargoes traded, two at $25.20 and one at $25.70 per barrel, all on a free-on-board Singapore basis.</p>
<p>The $25.70 deal was the first time in about three weeks that physical gas oil traded above the $25.50 mark and is seen as an indication that the buyers may look to give the market a new push, traders said.</p>
<p>The May/June spread traded at about 10 cents this morning despite talks that there are some unsold prompt cargoes in Singapore.  </p>
<p>Traders said the May/June trade reflected market confidence that the prompt cargoes should be able to find a home without much difficulty.</p>
<p>Fuel oil was steady despite the crude surge with June quoted unchanged at $101/$102 per tonne.</p>
