<p>Mexico has posted a solid if not spectacular recovery from recesssion and broadened its basis for future growth, analysts said on Monday after a report that gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter rose by more than five percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>First-quarter GDP growth emerged in line with revised forecasts at 5.1 percent, after the goverment massaged expectations downwards late last week. The number also followed Thursday's disappointing 6.2 percent result for Q1 industrial output.  </p>
<p>&quot;Today's figure was in line with the lower expectations of last week...analysts had (previously) expected stronger growth but this is not a bad figure,&quot; said Enrique Ramirez, economist at Santander Investment in Mexico City.</p>
<p>&quot;We can see that the base of economic growth is becoming broader and this is positive,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But Denis Parisien, Vice President for Latin American Research at Bankers Trust in New York, was more bearish.</p>
<p>&quot;My impression is it's not terribly impressive,&quot; he said. &quot;The spectacular numbers of the second half of 1996 are no more.... Now we have to adjust our expectations.&quot;  </p>
<p>Seasonal adjustments, to remove the distorting base-year effect, painted a less rosier picture, he added. Last year's figures looked particularly strong but they themselves were compared against the 1995 recessionary year.</p>
<p>&quot;If you seasonally adjust 5.1 percent the quarter on quarter growth is about flat (from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the first quarter of 1997),&quot; Parisien said.</p>
<p>A Reuter survey of analysts' forecasts for Q1 GDP growth, compiled in the week ending May 9, showed predictions ranging between 3.9 and 6.2 percent, with the average at 5.12 percent.  </p>
<p>Last week Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz deflated expectations to between 4.5 and 5.0 percent.</p>
<p>Markets were also disappointed when growth in industrial production for March came out at 4.2 percent against market expectations closer to 7.65 percent.</p>
<p>Many analysts voiced scepticism at official explanations which said growth would have been closer to 11 percent if it were not for the fewer working days in March, mainly due to the Easter holy week.  </p>
<p>Gray Newman, chief economist at HSBC James Capel in Mexico City, said he calculated a level closer to 9.0 percent, while Parisian's estimate was closer to 6.0 percent.</p>
<p>Monday's GDP growth data was on balance neutral for the market, analysts said. But some saw reason for optimism in the 5.0 percent growth clocked up in the services sector.</p>
<p>Analysts at market consultants IDEA for one had forecast growth there of around 3.8 percent.  </p>
<p>The services component was itself boosted by a 5.6 percent year-on-year rise in the commerce, restaurant and hotel sector, a 7.3 percent rise in transport and communications and a still poor but greater than expected increase in financial sector services of 4.7 percent.</p>
<p>Some analysts took this to indicate a broader participation in the move out of recession.</p>
<p>&quot;Services are a reflection of the domestic market -- these figures show that the internal market is slowly recovering,&quot; Santander's Ramirez said.</p>
<p>Last year the industrial sector led Mexico's GDP growth, with greatest strength in manufacturing.</p>
