<p>Afghanistan's rebel Taleban Islamic militia said on Friday it had captured a government-held district in the eastern province of Logar after overnight fighting, a Pakistan-based Afghan news service reported.</p>
<p>The Taleban forces now control the whole of Azra district, the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) quoted a Taleban spokesman in the northwestern Pakistani town of Peshawar as saying. There was no immediate confirmation of the report.  </p>
<p>AIP said President Burhanuddin Rabbani's government had sent fresh reinforcements to the area on Thursday night and on Friday.</p>
<p>An Afghan government spokesman in Kabul said on Thursday that the Taleban had launched a major offensive on Azra. He added that it was an apparent move to reach the strategic town of Sarobi east of Kabul to control the main eastern highway to neighbouring Pakistan.</p>
<p>Both sides used artillery and tanks in the battle for Azra, AIP said. It quoted Taleban spokesman Maulvi Ahmad Jan as saying that nine government fighters were killed, including a commander.</p>
