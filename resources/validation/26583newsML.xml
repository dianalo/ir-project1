<p>Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tareq Aziz informed the United Nations on Sunday that Iraqi troops had received instructions to pull out from areas they captured in the northern Kurdish regions, the U.N. said.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in a statement, said Aziz had telephoned him to say the situation in the northern city of Arbil was calm and that &quot;Iraqi troops had received instructions to withdraw from the region.&quot; The Iraqi government earlier on Sunday had made a similar statement in Baghdad.  </p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Aziz further states that from its inception, the intervention in Abril was temporary and limited to preventing possible intervention from Iran on the side of one of the Kurdish parties,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali earlier on Sunday said he was delaying sending staff to Iraq who would be involved in implementing the oil-for-food deal, which allows Baghdad to sell $2 billion of oil over six months to buy food and medicine for its population under sanctions.</p>
<p>He did not say how long the delay would be but emphasised that his &quot;greatest concern is for peace in the region and the well-being of United Nations observers.&quot;</p>
<p>U.N. officials said the delay concerned 14 oil monitors from the Dutch-based Saybolt firm 32 customs inspectors from the British Lloyd's Register, who were hired by the United Nations to help implement the programme.</p>
