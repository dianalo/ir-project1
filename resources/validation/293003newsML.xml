<headline>CZECH HARVARD TO PAY RESTITUTION PLUS INTEREST.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1997-01-08</dateline>

<p>Viktor Kozeny, founder of the Czech-based fund manager Harvard Capital &amp; Consulting (HC&amp;C), said on Wednesday that more than 200 million crowns will be repaid to one of its funds, plus interest, for Harvard's improper trading activities.</p>
<p>In a statement issued by a Prague public relations firm, Kozeny said that an amount &quot;exceeding 200 million crowns&quot; in restituion for trading violations would be paid to Harvard's Guarantee and Multilple Fund, &quot;including 14 percent interest&quot; and would be repaid &quot;at the latest by the end of 1997.&quot;  </p>
<p>At the end of December, HC&amp;C, which became a symbol of Czech post-Communist capitalism, said it paid a one million crown fine for illegal trading practices from 1993 to 1995, after a ruling by the Finance Ministry in the summer.</p>
<p>Kozeny, the young Czech-born entreprenuer who founded HC&amp;C, which is not connected to the U.S. college where he once studied, confirmed from his base in the Bahamas that the fine was paid in June.</p>
<p>The violations, according to finance ministry officials included &quot;dealing with the assets of the fund with unprofessional care&quot;, and included using fund assets for advertising and promotion which should have come out of the hefty management fees it was charging.</p>
<p>In the statement on Wednesday, Kozeny said that Harvard had a different interpretation of the law on fund management than did the finance ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;That's how life is,&quot; he said in the statment, denying that he never authorised any illegal capital operation.  </p>
<p>The Finance Ministry decision, taken in the summer and still not published in full, was first revealed last month in the U.S. magazine Fortune. The ministry has not said why the decision was not published.</p>
<p>The magazine said the decsion included findings that Harvard was selling shares out of its funds' assets at &quot;knockdown&quot; prices to companies connected to Kozeny.</p>
<p>In his latest statement, Kozeny said the Fortune article was a &quot;gross attack&quot; on the massive Czech post-Communist privatisation process, and rejected criticism that Harvard shareholder had been damaged.</p>
<p>&quot;In every democratic management of a company, shareholders have enough room to express their will and are not dependent on criticism from above,&quot; Kozeny said.</p>
<p>&quot;(Share) prices are determined by the market and bourse. The bourse is responsible for formulating such rules that that the price of shares reflects their real market value.&quot;</p>
<p>He attributed some criticism aimed at him to &quot;traditional Czech envy&quot;.</p>
