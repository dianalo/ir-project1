<title>BELGIUM: Tax tactics to continue to boost Belgian bonds.</title>
<headline>Tax tactics to continue to boost Belgian bonds.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1996-11-15</dateline>

<p>Belgian linear bonds, moving higher in an illiquid market on Friday morning, are expected to continue their seemingly inexorable rise, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;This market is clearly bullish. There are many buyers and no one wants to sell so it will keep rising,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>A strong overnight performance in U.S. treasuries lifted German Bunds which in turn buoyed OLOs, but traders noted that for a variety of other reasons -- including not wanting to incur a large tax bill on capital gains -- operators were simply disinclined to sell.  </p>
<p>Traders said what little business there was on Friday was confined to the shorter maturities.</p>
<p>The yield of the benchmark 2006 OLO, which dropped below six percent for the first time on Thursday, edged lower again on Friday morning to 5.97 percent from Thursday's closing 5.98.</p>
<p>The spread over 10-year Bunds remained at an unchanged 16 basis points.</p>
<p>The December futures contract was 13 basis points up at 120.38.</p>
