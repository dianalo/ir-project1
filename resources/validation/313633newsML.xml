<p>China told the United States on Thursday not to link granting of permanent Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status to the way Beijing handles its takeover of the British colony of Hong Kong this year.</p>
<p>&quot;MFN status has nothing to do with Hong Kong issues,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;The American people need not worry about this,&quot; he said when asked to comment on a statement this week by visiting U.S. Congressman Jim Kolbe that China was unlikely to win permanent MFN status this year.</p>
<p>U.S. concerns over whether China will keep its promise to leave Hong Kong untouched after the British colony reverts to Chinese rule this year would slow Beijing's hopes of permanent MFN, the Arizona Republican told reporters.</p>
<p>China was unlikely to win permanent MFN status this year, Kolbe said, adding that the United States wanted to monitor the return of Hong Kong for about a year before looking at a change in the way MFN is granted to Beijing.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton would have to certify permanent MFN status in June, the same month as the transfer of power for the British colony. China recovers sovereignty at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>Shen repeated a frequent Chinese call to the United States to end its annual review process for the renewal of MFN, which grants China the same tariff treatment accorded to other U.S. trading partners</p>
<p>&quot;We think this matter should be resolved appropriately,&quot; Shen said. &quot;It should not be reviewed every year, this is meaningless. It will influence mutual trade.&quot;</p>
<p>China hailed Clinton's decision in 1995 to delink the annual renewal of MFN from China's human rights record and has since been pushing hard for Washington to end the whole annual review process.</p>
<p>Some U.S. senators have urged Washington to grant China permanent MFN status on grounds the annual review was a disadvantage to the United States and caused uncertainty to business.</p>
<p>Kolbe's doubts over Hong Kong were unlikely to interrupt a smiling campaign by Chinese leaders after President Jiang Zemin granted a rare meeting this week to the congressman and other members of the U.S. House of Representatives to try to boost ties to the American congress.</p>
<p>Beijing and Washington have been trying to mend ties that were badly strained by a series of disputes over the last two years ranging from Taiwan to trade and human rights.</p>
<p>Last November, Jiang and Clinton agreed on an exchange of presidential visits in 1997 and 1998, which would be the first since President George Bush came to China in early 1989.</p>
