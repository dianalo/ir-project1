<p>Radio Romania news headlines:</p>
<p>* President Emil Constantinescu held a news conference on Thursday to present a report on his first six months in office and the results of the presidency's four major programmes -- fight against corruption, bid for NATO and European Union membership, support to Romania's children and the development of infrastructure to serve the country's integration into Europe's main transport corridors.</p>
<p>* Constantinescu said the fight against corruption had been successful with fraud and tax evasion worth 1.57 trillion lei revealed over the past six months and an additional 517 billion lei recovered from smuggling and tax evasion.</p>
<p>* Romania has yet to solve its thorniest issue -- the nation's poverty, Constantinescu told the news conference. He said reforms were the only key to the country's prosperity.</p>
<p>The government should not give up reforms under pressure from trade unions, the president said.</p>
<p>* Constantinescu's electoral programme -- the 200-days &quot;Contract with Romania&quot; -- has been fulfilled, said government Secretary-General Remus Opris, who attended the news conference.</p>
<p>* Constantinescu denied rumours of a government reshuffle.</p>
<p>* Parliament's lower Chamber of Deputies voted to ratify Romania's political treaty with Ukraine. It then resumed debates on a bill to amend a 1991 land restitution law.</p>
<p>* President Constantinescu will start a visit to Germany on July 2, where he is due to meet Chancellor Helmuth Kohl, Bonn officials announced on Thursday.</p>
