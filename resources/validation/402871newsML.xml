<p>The board of directors of the Central Bank of Cyprus will decide on Thursday whether to approve a half a percentage point reduction in commercial interest rates, a bank official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The position of the central bank has been stated,&quot; a senior bank official told Reuters. &quot;It wants to see a reduction in interest rates by half a point, (concerning) interest on deposits and on loans.&quot;</p>
<p>Commercial bank interest rates are now 8.5 percent for loans and 7.0 percent for deposits.</p>
<p>Last month the central bank cut its lombard lending rate by half a percentage point to 7.0 percent and its overnight deposit rate to 4.0 percent from 5.0 percent.</p>
<p>Banking sources said a cut in commercial rates would help reinvigorate business activity and absorb excess liquidity accumulated due to low demand.</p>
<p>The central bank official said that reduced rates, if approved, would apply immediately for new loans. For outstanding accounts, deposit rates would be cut first and loan rates after a period.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been an estimate by the central bank that if both deposit rates and the loans interest rates were reduced at the same time there will be some eight (or) nine million pounds ($15.7 or $17.7 million) loss to the banks,&quot; said Takis Pantzaris, Chairman of the Association of Commercial Banks.</p>
<p>Pantzaris told Reuters commercial banks agreed with the reduction of rates. &quot;We have agreed with the central banks that the conditions are such, because of the excess liquidity, that are conducive to reducing the interest rates and the deposit rates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Interest rates were last reduced by commercial banks in two stages in 1994, with a 50 basis point cut in the deposit rate followed some months later by a 50 basis point cut in lending rates.</p>
<p>The government plans to deregulate interest rates and lift restrictions on capital flows in future in its drive to align legislation with directives of the European Union, with which it is due to start entry negotiations next year. ($= 0.51 pounds)</p>
