<title>UK: SHELL BACKERS SEE EVIDENCE OF COMING GROWTH.</title>

<p>Shell's second-quarter results gave little reason to be cheerful, but investors should not ignore clear signs pointing to brighter times ahead, several leading analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have given sufficient excuses for the disappointing results and our view is that the long-term growth story is intact,&quot; said Paul Spedding at Kleinwort Benson.</p>
<p>The pound's strength and one-off setbacks in the chemicals sector are holding back Shell now, but the oil giant's upstream activities should fuel profits in years to come, Shell's supporters said.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, it is a sharp 16 percent fall in Shell's capital expenditure which indicates the Anglo-Dutch group is on course, said Fergus Macleod at NatWest Markets.</p>
<p>Rather than fearing a weaker asset base, he saw the drop as evidence Shell's managers are spending their money more wisely.</p>
<p>He pointed to British Petroleum's recovery in the early 1990s which was also preceded by a sudden capital expenditure slowdown.</p>
<p>The same happened with Shell's U.S. unit Shell Oil, which in recent years has taken the lead in the group's drive to cut out fat.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly the drive to improve returns in downstream and chemicals is not yet evident,&quot; Macleod said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the fact Shell is undershooting its capital budget is clear evidence pressure is mounting on the operational management for better results,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>This argument, however, failed to convince every analyst in the industry. Several said Shell clearly underperforms its peer group in terms of return on capital employed.</p>
<p>They also believed investors will have to wait too long before Shell's sharper focus will start bearing fruit.</p>
<p>&quot;It's always jam tomorrow with Shell,&quot; said SocGen's Irene Himona, who has downgraded the share to a &quot;sell&quot; from a &quot;hold&quot;.</p>
