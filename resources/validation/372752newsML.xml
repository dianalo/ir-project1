<p>Recent factory employment data suggest bubbling U.S. industrial output at the end of 1996 was probably reduced to a simmer in January, economists said.</p>
<p>In part, economists based their forecasts on an 18,000 rise in manufacturing jobs, combined with a drop in the factory workweek in January. Experts polled by Reuters, on average, expect industrial production to rise a tame 0.1 percent on the heels of a 0.7 percent increase in December.  </p>
<p>&quot;Overall, we're talking about a modest gain following two pretty impressive increases in November and December,&quot; said Anthony Karydakis, senior financial economist at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc.</p>
<p>Industrial output rose 0.8 percent in November. The January numbers are due to be released by the Federal Reserve at 0915 EST/1415 GMT on Friday, February 14.  </p>
<p>Other anecdotal evidence reflecting a partial reading on January business activity -- such as initial jobless claims, consumer confidence, and the Business Week production index -- point to a respectable reading, said Gary Thayer, senior economist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.</p>
<p>But despite resonably good automobile sales in January, economists said car manufacturing during the first month of 1997 may have fallen a little short of expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the (industrial production) number could be pretty good, but there is the wild card on car production,&quot; Thayer said.  </p>
<p>Utilities' output could also be somewhat of a drag on the overall industrial yield in January, Karydakis said.</p>
<p>Regarding capacity utilization, released in tandem with the production data, economists predict a small drop in the rate to 83.4 percent from 83.5 percent in December.</p>
<p>Even though the rate edged up in recent months, the Federal Reserve probably sees little danger of higher prices from potential production bottlenecks, economists said.</p>
<p>The production data are likewise not expected to have any implications for Fed policy, they said.</p>
