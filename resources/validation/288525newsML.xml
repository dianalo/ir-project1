<text>
<p>A Peruvian mayor said on Sunday he had received a death threat from the same Marxist guerrilla group that is holding 74 hostages in Lima, local radio said.</p>
<p>Alcides Chamorro Valdin, mayor of the highland district of Chilca, received letters at his house threatening to kill him unless he improved his conduct and initiated an employment plan, Cadena Peruana de Noticias radio station said.</p>
<p>The letters were signed by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), it said -- the same group that stormed the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima on December 17.</p>
<p>One of the letters warned the mayor that he might be &quot;liquidated, or perhaps we will do to you what our comrades are doing in Lima at the Japanese embassy ... Be careful. MRTA.&quot;</p>
<p>The report could not immediately be confirmed with the mayor or the police.</p>
