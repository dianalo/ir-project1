<title>USA: OPTIONS - June T-bond volatility at contract low.</title>
<headline>OPTIONS - June T-bond volatility at contract low.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Implied volatility rates for U.S. Treasury bond options were at contract lows at midday, a reflection of how widespread is the sentiment that Federal Reserve policymakers soon will nudge interest rates higher, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's news is a given,&quot; said Brad Tyl, analyst for Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. &quot;The only news today is if they did nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Any action taken by the Federal Open Market Committee today was expected to be revealed at about 1415 EST/1915 GMT.  </p>
<p>June bond volatility at midsession was quoted at 9.2 percent, the lowest it has been since the options were listed last summer, according to Optima Investment Research. May volatility also was estimated at 9.2 percent. Both were down about 0.1 point from the previous session.</p>
<p>&quot;Vols have been crushed in Eurodollars, bonds and mid-curve Euros,&quot; said a bond floor trader. &quot;They're all unbelievably cheap.&quot;  </p>
<p>June bond futures were recently trading at 109-12, up 12/32, and have been wedged between the highest concentrations of open interest in options, at the 108-00 and 112-00 strikes. With futures priced in the middle of expectations, volatility typically trends lower, said Tyl.</p>
<p>In Eurodollar options, floor analysts said market participants have been liquidating put positions, pushing volume in puts to an even ratio with volume in calls.</p>
<p>The put liquidation most likely was the result of profit-taking after prices fell over the past month, said one floor analyst in Eurodollars.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe the market has priced in enough&quot; of a tightening, the analyst said.</p>
<p>Eurodollar volatility levels were holding fairly steady at midsession, at 9.5 percent in June, 12.1 percent in September, 13.6 percent in December, 15.3 percent in March, 16.7 percent in June 1998 and 17.4 percent in September 1998. --Chicago Derivatives Desk ((312 408 8750)) E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com</p>
