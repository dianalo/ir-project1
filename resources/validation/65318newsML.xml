<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-09-19</dateline>

<p>Dutch shares held their ground on Thursday to close slightly higher despite a slip on Wall Street on renewed interest rate hike fears.</p>
<p>The AEX index closed up 0.65 points at 563.81, off the day's high of 565.86.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was driven largely by options traders trying to keep the AEX below the key 565 point level ahead of tomorrow's options expiry.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is already playing the game for tomorrow and the options expiry,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;It looks like they want it to expire at this level.&quot;  </p>
<p>Earlier in the session, the AEX dipped briefly on stronger than expected August German M3 money supply data, but soon gained ground in line with bonds.</p>
<p>Dealers were split on the prospects for the AEX. Some said the market looked increasingly nervous at these levels -- just nine points or so off its record high.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is holding their positions, afraid to miss the move up,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;But with everyone in, I wonder where the new cash to drive it higher will come from,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>A number of dealers were bullish on the index in the longer term, looking for it to hit 600 points by the end of the year.  </p>
<p>A dearth of company news meant little in the way of individual company stock movements.</p>
<p>Unilever shares climbed to a new year high on what dealers said was strong buying interest from the U.S. and Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;It could still be the switching from Heineken to Unilever story but volumes in Heineken are pretty low and those at Unilever fairly high,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The stock closed up 3.70 guilders at 269.10 after earlier reaching a new year high of 270.80.</p>
