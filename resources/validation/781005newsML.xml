<headline>BASEBALL-PIAZZA HOMERS TWICE AS DODGERS EDGE EXPOS IN 10.</headline>

<p>Mike Piazza's second homer of the game, a solo shot leading off the 10th inning, gave the Los Angeles Dodgers a 5-4 win over the Montreal Expos Tuesday.</p>
<p>Piazza, who belted a three-run homer in the first, lashed an 0-2 offering from Expos closer Ugueth Urbina (3-8) over the centre-field fence for his 24th homer of the season to give the Dodgers their eighth win in 10 games.</p>
<p>&quot;He is a real tough guy, a tough pitcher,&quot; Piazza said. &quot;I fought a real tough slider, 0-2. It was a really nasty pitch. Fortunately, he challenged me in there again. I didn't try to do too much with it. I just pulled my hands in and got the barrel of the bat on it.&quot;</p>
<p>Piazza came into the game just 1-for-13 on the road trip before collecting three hits.</p>
<p>Montreal pinch-hitter Darren Fletcher hit his career-high 13th homer of the season off Todd Worrell (2-3) with one out in the bottom of the ninth, knotting the game at 4-4. Worrell got the win despite suffering his seventh blown save of the season for the Dodgers, who led 4-0 after five innings.</p>
<p>&quot;We battled back, but Piazza was a one-man wrecking crew tonight,&quot; Fletcher said. &quot;We tried to crowd him inside, because we don't like to let him extend his hands. He was able to extend through the zone, and he crushed it like a 3-iron.&quot;</p>
<p>Dodgers starter Pedro Astacio allowed three runs and eight hits over 6 2/3 innings with five strikeouts and no walks. In his last four outings, the right-hander has yielded just five runs over 29 1/3 innings.</p>
<p>The Dodgers trail San Francisco by 1 1/2 games in the National League West.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Jason Kendall and Jose Guillen homered in a four-run fourth inning and ex-Brave Jason Schmidt won his third straight game as the Pirates edged Atlanta 5-4.</p>
<p>Schmidt (7-6) allowed four runs and five hits over seven innings for his sixth win in his last eight decisions.</p>
<p>Rich Loiselle notched two of his three strikeouts in the ninth with a runner on third for his 18th save in 20 chances.</p>
<p>Tom Glavine (10-6) took the loss for Atlanta, whose lead over Florida in the N.L. East shrank to 4 1/2 games.</p>
<p>At Florida, Moises Alou's bases-loaded two-run single with one out in the bottom of the ninth lifted the Marlins to their third straight victory, 6-5 over the Houston Astros.</p>
<p>Alou fouled off three pitches from Astros closer Billy Wagner (7-4) before lining a 1-2 pitch into right, scoring Edgar Renteria and pinch-runner Kurt Abbott.</p>
<p>Closer Robb Nen (8-2) allowed one hit in a scoreless ninth as the Marlins won for the seventh time in eight games.</p>
<p>In New York, Edgardo Alfonzo's bases-loaded sacrifice fly with one out in the bottom of the 10th scored Bernard Gilkey as the Mets edged the St Louis Cardinals 5-4.</p>
<p>After the Mets rallied with a run in the bottom of the ninth to tie the game, the Cardinals had a pair of runners in the top of the 10th against closer John Franco. But steady rain turned into a torrential downpour and the game was halted for 95 minutes.</p>
<p>When play resumed, Corey Lidle (5-1) struck out Gary Gaetti to preserve the tie. Tony Fossas (1-4) took the loss.</p>
<p>New York's Pete Harnisch, in his first start of the season after a battle with depression, went six innings and yielded two runs on five hits with three strikeouts and a walk.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Bill Mueller snapped an eighth-inning tie with a three-run triple and Danny Darwin and two relievers combined on a five-hitter, leading the San Francisco Giants to their third straight victory, 8-2 over the Cubs.</p>
<p>Julian Tavarez (4-3) worked two scoreless innings for the victory and Roberto Hernandez pitched the ninth.</p>
<p>Cubs reliever Bob Patterson (1-5) took the loss.</p>
<p>In Cincinnati, Reggie Sanders had three hits including a three-run homer as the Reds defeated the reeling San Diego Padres 7-3.</p>
<p>Fill-in starter Mike Remlinger (4-4) struck out a career-high nine batters over five innings. Remlinger came out of the bullpen to make his second start of the season and allowed three runs, seven hits and three walks.</p>
<p>Scott Sullivan added three scoreless innings, striking out four, before Jeff Shaw finished up with a scoreless ninth. Cincinnati pitchers recorded 14 strikeouts.</p>
<p>Tony Gwynn went 2-for-4, raising his average to .390 for the Padres, who have lost six of their last seven games.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Eric Young's run-scoring double with two outs in the eighth capped a three-run rally and lifted the Colorado Rockies past the Phillies, 4-2.</p>
<p>The Rockies rallied from a 2-0 deficit against closer Ricky Bottalico (2-4). Darren Holmes (4-2) notched the victory with two scoreless innings in relief.</p>
