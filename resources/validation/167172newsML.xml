<p>A long-running corporate battle for control of Britain's Lloyds Chemists Plc flared anew Tuesday when German pharmaceutical wholesaler Gehe AG launched a fresh 650.6 million British pound ($1.08 billion) bid.</p>
<p>A verbal war between Gehe and its British rival for Lloyds, UniChem Plc, which has raged since both launched takeover bids early this year, heated up as they traded blows in an attempt to win over Lloyds shareholders.</p>
<p>The total value of Gehe's new all-cash bid was slightly lower than Unichem's rival $1.09 billion bid, which is composed of cash and stock.</p>
<p>Lloyds responded to the latest Gehe bid by advising its shareholders to take no action. UniChem said it believed that Gehe could obtain less value from Lloyds Chemists in cost savings and revenue benefits than UniChem.</p>
<p>&quot;The shadow boxing period is over. I am confident that when it comes to the line that Lloyds' investors will be interested in taking a stake in an integrated business like ours in the healthcare sector,&quot; UniChem Chief Executive Jeffery Harris said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Both Gehe's original bid, an all-cash offer pitched at 500 pence ($8.26) a share, along with a rival offer from UniChem, lapsed in March after being referred to Britain's competition authority, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>
<p>Unichem, which already owns 9.9 percent of Lloyds, launched another bid on Oct. 18 on the same terms as its offer that lapsed in March.</p>
<p>It is offering 16 new UniChem shares and 926 pence ($15.30) in cash for every 10 Lloyds shares, valuing Lloyds at 657.6 million pounds ($1.09 billion).</p>
<p>This time around Gehe, Europe's largest drug distributor, is offering 500 pence ($8.26) in cash for each share in Lloyds and 322.6 pence ($5.33) in cash for each preference share.</p>
<p>Gehe Chairman Dieter Kammerer said in a statement, &quot;This is a highly attractive offer because unlike Unichem's bid it is all cash and is therefore risk-free for Lloyds' shareholders.&quot;</p>
<p>UniChem's Harris responded by saying, &quot;I think there is an appetite for shares rather than cash in the London market generally at the moment. So I don't believe that is going to be a factor that weighs in their favour, quite the contrary.&quot;</p>
