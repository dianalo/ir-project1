<headline>SOCCER-ENGLISH F.A. ASK WRIGHT TO EXPLAIN &quot;PERVERT&quot; REMARK.</headline>

<p>The English Football Association said on Friday it would be asking Arsenal striker Ian Wright for his comments after an extraordinary attack on Sheffield Wednesday manager David Pleat.</p>
<p>Wright reportedly branded Pleat &quot;a pervert&quot; after Pleat protested to the F.A. for two alleged incidents involving the Arsenal forward in the recent Premier league game at Highbury which the Gunners won 4-1.</p>
<p>F.A. spokesman Steve Double said: &quot;We are writing to Ian Wright asking for his observations on the reported comments in today's papers.&quot;</p>
<p>The F.A. are believed to be keen to defuse the war of words between the two and Pleat said: &quot;Ian has been misled. His words aren't worthy of comment.&quot;</p>
<p>It now seems likely that the Wednesday manager will leave the matter in the hands of the F.A., rather than taking legal action.</p>
<p>Pleat called for an inquiry after Wright was caught on television pulling the dreadlocks of Wednesday's Dutchman, Regi Blinker, and stamping on Yugoslav defender Dejan Stefanovic.</p>
<p>Wright denies the accusations and is quoted in today's Daily Mail as saying: &quot;He (David Pleat) can do what he likes. He can report me to the FA, but I just ask why is he doing it.</p>
<p>&quot;But if I do have to appear at the FA, I'll have my say about David Pleat. He's a pervert -- and you can print that.&quot;</p>
<p>Wright was referring to newspaper revelations nine years ago that Pleat was cautioned by police three times for kerb-crawling. The publicity forced him to resign as Tottenham manager.</p>
<p>Wright was also reported to have said: &quot;He couldn't have had much petrol in his car because he was always driving around so slowly.&quot;</p>
<p>Pleat moved on to manage at Leicester, Luton and now Wednesday, who led the Premiership after the first few games this season. The 50-year-old has not been involved in any further scandal.</p>
<p>Wright, speaking after Arsenal's UEFA Cup exit at the hands of Borussia Moenchengladbach, has accused Wednesday of sour grapes after losing the game. &quot;For him to say I pulled Regi Blinker's hair out of malice is nonsense. It was just a joke. I have spoken to Regi since and he knows that. He hasn't a problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no way I deliberately stamped on Stefanovic. I might have caught him as I came down after jumping for the ball, but that's all. There was nothing at the time to suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>&quot;It just seems sour grapes by Sheffield Wednesday. We beat them 4-1, they had Des Walker sent off and now they're making all this fuss and accusing me.&quot;</p>
<p>Wright has frequently been in trouble with the English F.A. and been fined and suspended for various offences over the last five years.</p>
