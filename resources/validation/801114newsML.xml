<p>Taiwan was likely to bring forward a planned government reshuffle to August 21 with key figures in the new cabinet starting to unfold, a ruling Nationalist Party-owned newspaper reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Premier Lien Chan told the Central Daily News that his cabinet would tender its resignation on August 21 -- a week earlier than a planned August 28 resignation -- to avoid possible schedule conflict with the ruling party's August 24-28 party congress.</p>
<p>&quot;The party congress will have meetings until the afternoon on August 28, making it difficult to arrange a time for the cabinet to tender its resignation,&quot; Lien, who doubles as vice president and the Nationalists' vice chairman, said.</p>
<p>&quot;The cabinet may resign a week earlier on August 21,&quot; Lien said in an interview with the daily on Wednesday.</p>
<p>As the premier, Lien has been under fire for the perceived deterioration of law and order after the kidnap and murder of a television celebrity's teen-age daughter, but analysts and local media have said Lien is giving up the post mainly to pursue his presidential ambitions.</p>
<p>The resignation is a formality and does not signal difficulty for the ruling party.</p>
<p>The newspaper, quoting high-level sources, said President Lee Teng-hui was expected to nominate lawmaker Vincent Siew as the new cabinet chief and foreign minister John Chang as vice premier next week.</p>
<p>The new cabinet will start operation on September 1.</p>
<p>Government sources have told Reuters that the ruling party has settled on Siew as its choice to lead a new cabinet once Lien, who was elected vice president in 1996, gives up the post to pursue his presidential ambitions.</p>
<p>Siew has repeatedly declined to comment on such an appointment.</p>
<p>Lien said he would have more time to help the president handle national affairs after stepping down as the cabinet chief, but declined to discuss his future career plan.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important thing for me in the next two years is to do my best as the vice president. As for what I will do two years from now, to be honest, it's too early for any kind of planning at this stage,&quot; Lien said.</p>
<p>&quot;Life is full of unpredictable factors,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>When asked about Taiwan's relations with arch-rival China, Lien told the newspaper Beijing should put aside sovereignty issues and resume negotiations -- suspended since mid-1995 after President Lee's U.S. visit -- with the island.</p>
<p>Beijing saw Lee's trip as an attempt to promote Taiwan independence.</p>
<p>Beijing has regarded Taipei as a rebel-held province, that one day should be reunified with the &quot;motherland&quot;, since a civil war split them in 1949.</p>
<p>Taipei officially favours eventual reunification with the mainland, but maintains that reunification is impossible before the Communist Party drops its power monopoly and allows political liberalisation.</p>
