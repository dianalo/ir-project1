<p>Russia launched a larger-than-expected $1.0 billion five-year Eurobond Thursday, the country's first international bond offering since the 1917 revolution.</p>
<p>The offering will pave the way for other Russian borrowers to follow, such as the cities of Moscow, St Petersburg and the Sverdlovsk region.</p>
<p>Companies like Russia's RAO Gazprom, the world's largest natural gas producer, Russia's biggest oil group NK LUKoil and the Russian Railways Ministry are also likely to follow suit.</p>
<p>The Eurobond, which had been discussed for some two years, is expected to yield 3.45 percentage points more than five-year U.S. Treasury notes, which currently have a rate of 5.91 percent, joint lead managers J.P. Morgan and SBC Warburg said.</p>
<p>While the yield was in line with market expectations, the size of the Eurobond was a surprise. Originally, the market had expected up to $500 million. As recently as Wednesday, bankers were talking about a $750 million issue.</p>
<p>The increases followed a promotional extravaganza in which three teams of Russian bankers and advisers toured 14 cities in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>Investors and bankers flocked to a presentation in London last Friday where Russia's Finance Minister Alexander Livshits said he wanted the Eurobond to show the country was a respectable borrower.</p>
<p>The marketing campaign started in Tokyo and culminated in New York Wednesday.</p>
<p>A number of hurdles needed to be overcome before the issue could be launched. These included the Russian presidential elections mid-year, credit ratings from the key rating agencies and President Boris Yeltsin's recovery from recent heart surgery.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said he was in a &quot;fighting mood&quot; on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday Russian officials released some MinFin domestic bonds which had been frozen.</p>
<p>Russia is rated Ba2 by Moody's Investors Service and BB-minus by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., which are below investment grade but were at the top end of market expectations when assigned in October.</p>
