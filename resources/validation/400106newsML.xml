<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities sauntered lower on Tuesday as market players generally rested ahead of Wednesday's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, mortgage experts said.</p>
<p>At 1530 EST/2030 GMT mortgages were unchanged to 2/32 lower overall. Yield spreads held steady to just slightly narrower, as comparable Treasuries traded off 2/32 to 3/32.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been pretty quiet out there, but it is the end of the month, so some internal adjustments are going on,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Analysts described fixed-income trading activity as &quot;amazingly&quot; light, considering the Treasury was auctioning about $17.5 billion of two-year notes.</p>
<p>In key coupons, Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5 percent paper was 1/32 lower at 100-18/32, yielding 106 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note. Comparable Fannie Mae issues were off 1/32 at 100-12/32, while Freddie Macs were off 2/32 at 100-17/19. The 10-year note was off 2/32 to yield 6.4 percent.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will address the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday during the first leg of his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.</p>
