<headline>UK gas Network Code faces biggest shake-up.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Network Code, the rulebook governing trading on the UK's natural gas pipeline system, is facing its biggest shake up, the Code's Manager said on Thursday.</p>
<p>John Lockett, Manager of the Network Code at pipeline operator Transco, part of BG plc, told a news conference that three proposals for change to the Code have been put forward.</p>
<p>&quot;They could lead to the biggest changes since the beginning of the Network Code,&quot; if they are implemented, he said.</p>
<p>The problem with the current system, he said, was that it was too dependent on absolutely accurate information for each supply point, and this was becoming too expensive to administer.</p>
<p>Lockett pointed out that as many as 21 separate invoices were required for each supply point, and in some cases updates to these invoices were required within the day.</p>
<p>Given that there are shortly to be 19 million households with the right to choose different suppliers - but all of whom will have their gas carried by Transco - he said there could be &quot;tens of billions&quot; of items of data to reconcile every year.</p>
<p>&quot;The question for the industry is 'is it sensible?',&quot; Lockett asked, as this is such an expensive way of running the system.</p>
<p>Instead, Transco has put forward three proposals designed to reduce the cost and the administration. They were sent to the industry at the end of June and comments from interested parties are due back at Transco by Friday.</p>
<p>First, Transco has proposed establishing &quot;materiality levels&quot; for shippers making queries. This means, in effect, that shippers should only be able to query Transco - and so set in train an enquiry potentially tying up staff for two or three days - if their query is over a discrepancy which exceeds a certain, as yet undecided, amount.</p>
<p>At the moment, Lockett said, shippers can and do get Transco to launch enquiries over a discrepancy of a few pennies.</p>
<p>The second proposal is that certain data items should only be changed on a prospective basis, so that queries by shippers cannot have a retrospective impact. Transco says this is because such retrospective changes can have a knock-on effect and again tie up many people for long periods and have a disproportionate cost for relatively little benefit.</p>
<p>And the third proposed change is for the introduction of &quot;reconciliation by difference&quot; on the domestic gas market. This would allow Transco to avoid the expense of reconciling meter-point-by-meter-point, and instead to reconcile by eliminating all daily metered sites and all non-daily-metered (NDM) sites above 2,500 therms a year, and then reconciling in aggregate all NDM sites using less than this amount of gas.</p>
<p>&quot;This would greatly reduce the amount of invoice verification that would need to be undertaken,&quot; Transco said.</p>
<p>When shipper comments have been received, Transco will be holding an industry workshop on August 5 and 6. Some of the changes, for example on materiality and prospective data changes, could be implemented by the end of the year, Lockett said, if approved by shippers and industry regulator Ofgas.</p>
<p>Since the start of the Network Code a year and a half ago, changes have been made on a piecemeal basis as and when necessary by introducing modifications. The number of these is now well past 160 and rising all the time.</p>
