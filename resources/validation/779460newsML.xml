<p>Harried doctors treating Afghan opposition fighters wounded in a major battle near besieged Kabul said on Tuesday they had run out of blood for victims needing transfusions.</p>
<p>Sporadic shelling continued on Tuesday between the rebels and government forces at Sarai Khaja, the most advanced position of the so-called northern alliance, just two km (1-1/4 miles) from where Taleban troops were dug in on hills above them.</p>
<p>The exchanges followed Monday's bitter battle, in which tanks, jets and helicopter gunships were used as well as rocket and artillery fire backing ground attacks.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a big, big battle,&quot; commander Gul Haidar, who led the opposition troops, told Reuters. &quot;It was very important that we held them and we did.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the Islamic fundamentalist Taleban had thrown 12 tanks and ground forces into the failed, six-hour attack to break the alliance's two-week-old stranglehold on the capital.</p>
<p>A Taleban artillery shell landed 100 metres (yards) away as he spoke, sending Haidar and his bodyguards diving for cover.</p>
<p>Haidar said five of his soldiers had died and 23 had been wounded in fending off the Taleban attack in which he said at least 45 Taleban troops were killed and nearly 100 wounded.</p>
<p>Opposition wounded were taken to a crude and ill-equipped hospital in Charikar, eight km (five miles) behind the front line, where doctors said they were out of blood and vital medicine needed to fight off infection.</p>
<p>Omar Qasim, the only surgeon among the three doctors at the hospital, said he had operated virtually non-stop from three p.m. (1030 GMT) on Monday until four a.m. (2330 GMT Monday) on Tuesday on 15 victims with head, chest, leg and arm wounds.</p>
<p>&quot;Why doesn't the international community intervene to stop what is going on here?&quot; said the 29-year-old doctor, who studied at Kabul University before fleeing the capital to join the opposition when the Taleban captured Kabul in September.</p>
<p>&quot;We are out of blood, we are nearly out of plasma. We need medicine to stop infection, which kills so quickly in this heat,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Among those wounded in Monday's fighting was six-year-old Nabila, who suffered fearful head and face injuries from shrapnel from a Taleban air raid near her frontline village.</p>
<p>Fanned by a relative in the 45-degree (113 Fahrenheit) heat of a dusty hospital corridor, she moaned weakly in a near-coma.</p>
<p>Her parents and three brothers and sisters died in the raid and Qasim said her chances of survival were slight if she did not get advanced medical treatment.</p>
<p>Khodayar, a 16-year-old soldier wounded in the arm and leg on Monday, said he had been an apprentice carpenter in Kabul until he left to join the opposition four months ago.</p>
<p>&quot;My mother and father and brothers are still in Kabul,&quot; he said. &quot;I will give my life to get back to see them.&quot;</p>
<p>Khodayar was on an armoured personnel carrier hit by a Taleban rocket. &quot;My friend had his head blown off,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>All of the opposition commanders and victims interviewed on Tuesday blamed alleged Pakistani backing of the Taleban for the chaos in Afghanistan. Pakistan denies it supports the militia.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want sharia (Islamic law) courts in Afghanistan. We are already good Moslems,&quot; said commander Ibrahim Hassan, 27.</p>
<p>&quot;They need sharia courts in Pakistan where there are bad things happening,&quot; he said. &quot;We hear all about the sex and parties in Lahore.&quot;</p>
