<p>The new management of Marvel Entertainment Group Inc, led by investor Carl Icahn, has reached an agreement in principle with the company's banks and bondholders and the principal shareholders of Toy Biz Inc, a bank spokesman said Thursday.</p>
<p>The pact promises to end months of bitter legal battles and may enable Marvel to emerge from bankruptcy by autumn.  </p>
<p>Chase Manhattan Bank attorney Thomas Ambro told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Helen Balick that under the agreement, two Icahn entities will buy the $610 million in secured loans owed to Chase and other banks by Marvel.</p>
<p>The banks will receive $395 million cash, proceeds from the sale of Marvel subsidiaies Fleer Corp and Panini SpA, and warrants to buy 10 percent of a reorganized company that will merge Marvel with Toy Biz.</p>
<p>The estimated value of Fleer and Panini is $200-$215 million, and the estimated net equity value of the new company is $525 million, Ambro said.  </p>
<p>Under the agreement, the reorganized Marvel-Toy Biz will make a rights offering. Shareholders of Toy Biz, except for Marvel, will be allowed to buy 49 percent of the company. Shareholders of Marvel will be allowed to buy 51 percent. Marvel owns more than 70 percent of the shares of Toy Biz.</p>
<p>Marvel's newly installed president, Joseph Calamari, told Reuters, &quot;It's a great day for Marvel.  Marvel is now back with its movie 'Men in Black' and today's settlement with the banks.&quot;  </p>
<p>Calamari said most of the senior executives of Marvel resigned last week. &quot;I will be replacing them soon,&quot; he said. &quot;I've been with Marvel since 1971 and previously owned and ran the company with my partner Jim Galton.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he had spoken with Galton &quot;about doing certain projects&quot; for Marvel.</p>
<p>Fleer President Edmund Feeley and Marvel executive August Liguori were in Balick's courtroom but declined comment.</p>
<p>The agreement is expected to be made final on July 24, lawyers for the parties to the agreement said.</p>
<p>Balick has set August 28 for a hearing on the disclosure statement portion of the plan of reorgainzation.</p>
<p>An attorney for the bondholder trustee banks, James Spiotto, told Reuters, &quot;This deal still has to be finalized. Hopefully, all objections will be resolved.&quot;</p>
<p>Among the parties to the agreement are Isaac Perlmutter and Avi Arad, principal shareholders of Toy Biz.</p>
<p>The $395 million dollars to be paid to Marvel's banks will be provided to Marvel by the two Icahn entities.</p>
<p>Toy Biz shares were up 1-1/8 to 9-1/8.</p>
