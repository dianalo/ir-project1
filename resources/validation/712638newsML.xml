<p>France's junior minister for cooperation, Charles Josselin, preached greater transparency in dealings with Africa on Tuesday and said Paris would encourage African nations to stand on their own feet.</p>
<p>Speaking at the end of a 24-hour visit to Ivory Coast, France's main trading partner in Sub-Saharan Africa, Josselin said no decision had been taken on the future of French military bases on the continent, although the issue was under review.</p>
<p>But he said there was no question of France breaking its ties with Africa and rejected suggestions that trade could replace bilateral aid, saying this would harm many African countries -- even those often classed as emerging.</p>
<p>&quot;Our cooperation policies must become more transparent,&quot; Josselin told a news conference in response to questions about France's African policy under its new Socialist government.</p>
<p>Critics of past French governments accused them of maintaining devious relations with African leaders as a way of securing influence in the continent. Linking democratic and economic reforms, Josselin said France's relations with Africa should reflect modern realities -- a partnership between adults.</p>
<p>&quot;The new African elites do not have the same relationship with France...that their fathers did,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Josselin said France did not want to force itself on Africa. &quot;France wants to be in African only where it's wanted.&quot;</p>
<p>Breaking ties with Africa would be like cutting off a limb, he said, adding: &quot;That's not (going to be) the case.&quot;</p>
<p>Josselin said France was keen to see no backtracking on democratic reforms. &quot;We have our requirements as far as the march towards democracy is concerned,&quot; he said. &quot;There is a relation between emerging economies and emerging democracy.&quot;</p>
<p>He said those in power in Africa sometimes did not treat opposition parties as they should while opposition parties sometimes failed to play the role of proper oppositions.</p>
<p>&quot;The relationship between the economy and politics needs to be clarified,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Josselin, who also visited Senegal on his trip, said African nations had expressed a desire to take greater responsibility for security and peacekeeping. &quot;We plan to encourage them to assume their responsibilities,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said France was examining its military presence in Africa to take account of that, of broader reforms in the French armed forces and the fact that greater mobility meant it could protect its nationals in Africa differently.</p>
<p>&quot;No decision has been taken,&quot; he said, adding that he was concerned the issue was being overblown.</p>
<p>He said the idea of an African regional military organisation to ensure peacekeeping should be taken further.</p>
<p>Ivorian President Henri Konan Bedie, he said, had stressed a desire to maintain a French military presence in Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>On the cooperation front, he rejected the idea that trade could be a substitute for bilateral aid.</p>
<p>&quot;We refuse to set public aid against private investment,&quot; he said. &quot;Public aid remains necessary for most countries, even for those that are often classed among emerging countries.&quot;</p>
