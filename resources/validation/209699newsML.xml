<headline>Chilean blue chips tread water, end touch higher.</headline>
<dateline>SANTIAGO 1996-11-22</dateline>

<p>Chilean blue chips ended narrowly higher after a day of listless trading as the market awaited economic growth figures due to be released Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is in suspense until Monday. It was very inactive today,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Expectations that the Central Bank's restrictive policy will be in place until the end of the first quarter of 1997 or even later continued to drain the market, said others.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is going to be depressed until it sees a sign from the authorities that there will be a cut in interest rates,&quot; said Iva Longeri, research director at Larrain Vial.  </p>
<p>The selective IPSA index closed 0.1 percent higher to 95.75 points. The all-share IGPA ended 0.15 percent lower at 5211.10 points on paltry volume of 6.4 billion pesos.</p>
<p>All eyes were on Monday, when the Central Bank will issue the Imacec economic growth figure for September, and October foreign trade figures.</p>
<p>In the peculiar logic of the Santiago market, a high growth rate will actually mean lower prices on the bourse, not higher, because it will suggest the economy is still growing too fast for the Central Bank to relax interest rates.  </p>
<p>Anything below five percent growth in September, on the other hand, will have the inverse effect because it will signal a slowdown in growth, brokers said.</p>
<p>The figure to be released Monday known as the Imacec -- a Spanish acronym for Monthly Economic Activity Index -- is a kind of early barometer for GDP growth and has become a key market-moving indicator.</p>
<p>Electrical stocks, which set the pace for the market most of the week, ended mixed. Enersis ended 0.90 percent lower to 246.10 pesos, while Chilgener rose 2.1 percent to 2250 pesos.  </p>
<p>An Enersis-led consortium's purchase of Brazilian utility Cerj this week and a huge, $800 million Yankee bond issue by Enersis this week gave electrical firms a big boost. But the market is still concerned about the effects of severe drought in central Chile on their costs.</p>
<p>&quot;With the Cerj purchase, Enersis and Endesa have had some passing good news,&quot; said Longeri, but worries about the drought and interest rates continued to weaken them, she said.</p>
<p>Banking stocks did well, with all the Banco de Chile series rising and Santander up 0.2 percent to 26.35 pesos.  </p>
<p>Andina lifted 0.7 percent to end at 2180 pesos on what one broker described as a cyclical rebound from recent losses. The company said this week it sees stronger earnings in its Brazilian operations next year after a slack 1996.</p>
<p>Among decliners, winery San Pedro slipped 2.6 percent to 2.28 pesos and Invercap fell 4.7 pesos to 304 pesos.</p>
