<p>Australian international David Knox has been signed by champion South African province Natal as cover for both fly-half and centre, Natal Rugby Union chief executive officer Brian van Zyl said on Friday.</p>
<p>Knox, who was controversially overlooked for the fly-half berth by the Australian selectors for the first test against France on Saturday, is expected to arrive in Durban next week.</p>
<p>Van Zyl confirmed the 33-year-old Australian Capital Territory (ACT) player had been contracted by Natal until the end of October.</p>
<p>&quot;He has been contracted by us on a match-by-match basis so, if he doesn't play, he doesn't get paid,&quot; van Zyl told Reuters.</p>
<p>Van Zyl said a clause in the contract enabled Knox to return to Australia if he was recalled for international commitments.</p>
<p>Knox, who represented Australia in eight tests over an 11-year period, was widely viewed as the form player in this season's Super 12.</p>
<p>He ignited an exciting ACT back line with shrewd variations of play and is seen by Natal as the ideal replacement when fly-half Henry Honiball is away on international duty for South Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as our selectors are concerned, he (Knox) was first choice as back-up fly-half when Henry is away on Springbok duty. But he is very versatile and can also play centre,&quot; van Zyl said.</p>
<p>Natal, the defending Currie Cup provincial champions, have turned in some erratic performances this season with defeats at the hands of both Free State and the Gauteng Lions in the Super 12 competition.</p>
<p>Lack of depth at fly-half and lock was highlighted in last Saturday's 42-12 humbling by the British Lions but coach Ian McIntosh has also struggled to find the right combination at centre where Springbok Jeremy Thomson has failed to produce his form of last year.</p>
<p>The experienced Knox, who was overshadowed for most of his international career by Mark Ella and Michael Lynagh, is clearly seen by Natal as quality insurance for both the fly-half and centre positions.</p>
<p>With Springbok jumper Mark Andrews also set to miss much of the South African domestic season, van Zyl confirmed Natal were looking at signing New South Wales and Australia lock John Wellborn.</p>
<p>&quot;He is in the frame, along with a few others,&quot; van Zyl said.</p>
