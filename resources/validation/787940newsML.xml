<headline>CBOT SOY PRODUCTS END MOSTLY HIGHER, WEATHER CITED.</headline>

<p>CBOT soy product futures ended mostly higher on Friday, led by new crop on renewed worries that weekend rains would again bypass dry pockets of central Illinois and Indiana, traders said.</p>
<p>Weather Services Corp said in its afternoon update, that a storm would hit the U.S. Midwest on Saturday and Sunday, bringing 0.25 to 0.75 inch with 40 to 50 percent coverage. WSC said that storm would favor the Ohio Valley.</p>
<p>A second storm should hit on Monday with scattered to widely scattered showers and thunderstorms of 0.25 to 0.75 inch with 40 to 50 percent coverage.</p>
<p>That system would favor Missouri and the Ohio Valley.</p>
<p>The trade has fixated on weekend weather forecasts because soybeans need moisture as they set and fill pods, traders said. Rainfall amounts have been below normal in some central Illinois and Indiana areas.</p>
<p>WSC said rainfall in Peoria over the last 30 days totalled 0.92 inch, or roughly 25 percent of normal. In Indianapolis, the 30-day rainfall was 14 percent of normal.</p>
<p>Soymeal ended $2.40 per ton higher to $0.40 lower with December up $1.50 at $210.00 a ton. Soyoil closed 0.23 to 0.13 cent per lb higher with December up 0.14 at 22.36 cents.  </p>
<p>The market shrugged off bearish data from the Conrad Leslie-ADM Elevator survey Friday which put U.S. soy production at 2.713 billion bushels.</p>
<p>On the day, commercials were largely on the sell-side of both soyoil and soymeal. ADM sold 100 lots August soyoil, Cargill Inc, Farmers Commodities Corp and Term Commodities each sold 100 December and Produce Grain sold 200 December and bought 100 August.</p>
<p>Smith Barney was a key seller of 400 September and 100 December, traders said.</p>
<p>In soymeal, Lind-Waldock bought 200 December, Smith Barney bought 100 each September and December and Cargill sold 100 each September, October and December.</p>
<p>Soymeal volume was estimated by CBOT at 15,000 lots, against Thursday's 17,560. Soyoil volume was pegged at 18,000 lots, against Thursday's 20,807.</p>
