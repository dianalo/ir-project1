<p>U.S. credit markets will have quite a lot to chew on Thursday as the government releases the key August producer price index (PPI) and fresh weekly jobless claims figures, analysts said.</p>
<p>PPI data will be carefully scrutinized since inflationary concerns continue to mount and fears of a September interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve are rampant, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are anticipating that inflationary pressures are still present in the economy,&quot; said Gary Thayer, senior economist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.  </p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is slated to release the August wholesale inflation report at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT. In a Reuters survey, economists see the overall producer price index rising 0.1 percent in August.</p>
<p>The core index, which excludes food and energy price fluctuations, is also seen rising 0.1 percent. In July overall PPI was unchanged and the core was up 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said finished goods prices are likely to remain subdued in the August report. &quot;A lot of attention will be on the core rate and the crude and intermediate goods,&quot; said Lee Youngdahl, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.  </p>
<p>&quot;People want to see whether there is any kind of a turning there from recent very favorable reading to maybe something less favorable,&quot; the economist added.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the market will also get jobless claims for the week ended September 7. The number is expected to show claims rose to 329,000 against the 316,000 registered in the previous week. The data are due out at 0830 EDT/1230 GTM.</p>
<p>The market will also take in the release of the Atlanta Federal Reserve regional economic survey for the month of August at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT.  </p>
<p>Pundits said Treasuries are expected to remain rangebound on Thursday if the economic reports come in line with the market's forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;We're likely to see more of the same if the numbers, mainly PPI, come in as expected,&quot; said a trader at a U.S. investment bank.</p>
<p>The current trading range for the bellwether 30-year bond is seen between 7.0 and 7.25 percent. The security was off 1/32 at 95-16/32 in late trading on Wednesday to yield 7.11 percent.  </p>
<p>Analysts at consulting firm MCM MoneyWatch Inc cited a study forecasting the bond market would to have a trend change on September 13.</p>
<p>Bruce Kamich, MoneyWatch's senior vice president, said the study, produced by Parallax Financial Research of Redmond, analyses 70 years of bond data using a unique cycle technique to forecast market turns.</p>
<p>Kamich said the study does not forecast which direction the market will take. But Kamich said: &quot;I think the market is more prepared for a break to the downside.&quot;  </p>
<p>Analysts said some heavy issuance in the corporate debt market lately could also keep prices depressed.</p>
<p>&quot;We had some heavy issues on the corporate side, which tend to weigh us down,&quot; Aubrey's Youngdahl said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve added that reserves to the banking system via overnight system repurchase agreements when the federal funds rate was quoted at 5-1/4 percent, in line with the Fed's target.</p>
<p>Fed funds are seen opening at 5.31 percent on Thursday, the first day of a new two-week maintanence period.</p>
