<p>The Philippine National Bank (PNB) is likely to meet its 2.1-billion peso ($74.7 million) net income forecast this year despite missing its target in the first six months, officials and analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, analysts said PNB has to reduce its expenses, improve its services and bring down its past due ratio to face the growing competition in the industry.</p>
<p>PNB posted a net profit of 955 million pesos in the first six months compared with 701 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Senior vice president Emerita Diaz said the first-half figure was slightly below target. &quot;It's less than 100 million pesos below,&quot; she told analysts.</p>
<p>But PNB president Peter Favila said he remained confident PNB would meet its 1997 earnings target despite the recent de facto peso devaluation and the hike in interest rates due to prospects of higher remittances from overseas contract workers in the second half.</p>
<p>Remittances of Filipino workers overseas sent through PNB's branches are expected to increase to $3 billion this year compared with the previous $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>Historically, PNB derives 60 percent of its earnings in the second half, Favila said.</p>
<p>&quot;There were no surprises in PNB's first-half earnings. It's within our expectation,&quot; said Angping Securities analyst Rodolfo Antonio Pantillano. &quot;I expect them to achieve their forecast.&quot;</p>
<p>Some analysts, however, were not as bullish on its prospects. DBS Securities analyst April Bautista said she was recommending a &quot;hold&quot; on PNB shares, which ended one peso off at 147 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bautista said PNB's past due ratio of four percent as of June 30 compared to the industry's 3.3 percent remained a cause for concern.</p>
<p>Michael Ordinanza, analyst at PCIBank Securities, said PNB's cost-to-income ratio was also higher at 76 to 77 percent compared to the industry's 55 to 60 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the promise of a better PNB lies in its re-engineering programme,&quot; DBS Securities' Bautista said.</p>
<p>The five-year programme which started last year was envisioned to fortify the competitive edge of PNB by streamlining its operation through automation, improvment of bank services and reduction of its manpower. ($1 = 28.50 peso)</p>
