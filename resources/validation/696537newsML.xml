<p>India, whose freedom 50 years ago marked the beginning of the end of the British empire, has congratulated China before it takes back Hong Kong and ends colonial rule in Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;We, in India, having experienced a colonial past, fully understand the joyous sentiments of the Chinese people on this occasion, as the last remnants of colonial rule in Asia are ended,&quot; Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said in a letter to Chinese Premier Li Peng.</p>
<p>The letter, dated July 24, was released on Monday by the Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>Gujral said Hong Kong was a major international trade and financial centre that has played a unique role in promoting economic cooperation between India and China, which fought a brief border war in 1962.</p>
<p>&quot;The continued prosperity of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region would be of mutual benefit to our two countries,&quot; he said, referring to the separate political and economic system that China has pledged to protect.</p>
<p>Gujral said the Indian community was an integral part of Hong Kong and that he expected it to play a significant role in its future development.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to further strengthening our links with the Hong Kong Special Administration Region. This will also contribute to the growing relationship of constructive cooperation between our two countries,&quot; the Indian leader said.</p>
<p>India will celebrate its 50th anniversary of independence from Britain on August 15.</p>
