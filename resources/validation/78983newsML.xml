<p>French economic growth prospects look good for the third quarter of 1996 due to strong household spending but could retreat in the following three months with an end to car-buying incentives, economists said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The economic outlook for the third quarter was bolstered by strong household spending data released by national statistics institute INSEE on Thursday, with spending rising three percent in August after a dip of 0.6 percent in July.</p>
<p>INSEE highlighted that the August spending surge was largely due to an 18.1 percent rise in car sales, which have in turn been further boosted by a new-cars-for-old subsidy scheme which comes to an end on September 30.</p>
<p>But other spending areas were quite robust and a finance ministry official said expectations were for another strong figure in September.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, the other spending sectors did well and another high consumption figure is expected in September,&quot; a finance ministry official said.</p>
<p>This view was shared by investment bank economists.</p>
<p>&quot;We already knew car sales had been very strong in August so the surprise is not in car sales. There's a possible surprise in the sense that durables, white and brown products that is, have performed very well,&quot; said Eric Chaney at Morgan Stanley bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the full year, consumption will be much higher than anyone had expected, including the government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;That said, car sales in September will be even higher than in August. But the price will be a fourth quarter which will turn out negative in terms of consumption. 1997 will start with a negative,&quot; the Morgan Stanley economist added.</p>
<p>Philippe Brossard, economist at ABN Amro, said he expected one percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter, due to strong spending but also a rise in the number of working days in the INSEE data compared to the second quarter.</p>
<p>Chaney said he was &quot;now confident of 1.1 percent GDP growth in the third quarter&quot; and he was revising his expectations for third quarter household spending for the period to 1.2 percent from a previous forecast of 0.7 percent.</p>
<p>David Naude, economist at JP Morgan investment bank, also said he was expecting &quot;renewed weakness&quot; in the fourth quarter on the grounds car sales were the main third quarter factor.</p>
<p>Brossard said of spending in August: &quot;Ex-autos it's still up 0.5, so it's not just the big one-off factor. We may still see further progress in September. It all adds up to strong third quarter growth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's still the problem of how spending will behave as the (car buying) incentive disappears. There may be a decline (in spending) in the fourth quarter but maybe by then other factors will come in, like investment and stock building.&quot;</p>
<p>The industry ministry said on Thursday that the &quot;Juppette&quot; car incentive scheme -- which is named after Prime Minister Alain Juppe and offers a discount on new cars to buyers who return cars of 10 years or age older -- would not be renewed.</p>
<p>Juppe has been counting on a recovery in consumer spending and business investment to fire up the economy in the latter half of this year. Finance Minister Jean Arthuis has forecast economic growth of up to 1.3 percent in 1996 and produced a 1997 budget based on a growth target of 2.3 percent next year.</p>
<p>While the spending figures augur well, they could well be tempered by August unemployment figures due out on Friday.</p>
<p>A small drop of 20,000 in July unemployment was seen by many economists as a aberration after unemployment returned to a 12.5 percent record high in June, with jobless numbers up 22,800.</p>
