<p>Hungary's Labour Ministry said on Wednesday February's rise in the unemployment figure was caused by temporary factors and did not reflect an underlying growth.</p>
<p>Ministry data released earlier put Hungary's unemployment total at 498,080, or 11.1 percent, in February, compared to 474,500, or 10.6 percent, the month before and 530,592, or 11.6 percent, in February 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth in February is in line with the trend experienced in the same period over the past several years,&quot; the ministry said in a statement, adding that the figures had been boosted by the ending of some job creation programmes and new additions of those completing their military service.</p>
<p>&quot;Government job creation programmes have just finished with those taking part in mainly public works schemes now re-registering as unemployed,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The ministry said the number of registered school leavers rose 3,800 in February to 42,900 but was 11,000 less than in February 1996 and accounted for 8.6 percent of the jobless total, compared to 10.2 percent in February last year.</p>
<p>February also saw a rise in job vacancies of 9.4 percent over January and of 21.8 percent from a year ago, the statement added.</p>
<p>The only real rise in jobless rates was in the agricultural sector, the statement added.</p>
