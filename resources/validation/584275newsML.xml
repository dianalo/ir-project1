<p>-- BANK WARNS THAT RATES MUST RISE</p>
<p>In its first quarterly report since being given the responsibility of setting UK interest rates, the Bank of England has cautioned that rates will need to be brought up in coming months due to the growth in domestic spending, occurring at a rate too rapid to keep inflation under control. The 'Inflation Report' predicted that government would fail to meet its 1999 inflation rate target range if rates are not changed.</p>
<p>-- BOEING WARNS OF TRADE WAR IF MERGER IS BLOCKED</p>
<p>Officials at US aerospace group Boeing have declared that if any attempt is made by the European Commission to block its merger with McDonnell Douglas, it will consider beginning a trade war. Boeing believes that even if the estimated $48 billion merger is approved by US officials, the EC will impose a 10 percent fine on its revenues. The EC is expected to set out its objections to the proposed merger over the next two weeks.</p>
<p>-- HORLICK POISED TO SET UP NEW TEAM AT SOCIETE GENERALE</p>
<p>Nicola Horlick, the former fund manager at German bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, has been given the opportunity to take a position at French Bank Societe Generale. Horlick would join up with Mercury Asset Management senior fund manager John Richards to build a team to provide representation for the bank in the UK. SocGen has said Horlick, who resigned from DMG amid speculation she attempted to lure managers to a competitor, has chances of &quot;better than one in two&quot; of joining.</p>
<p>--'WAR PLAN' TO STIFLE CURRENCY ATTACKS</p>
<p>A 'war plan' has been prepared by Luxembourg to fend off reported attacks in the financial markets which pose a threat to economic and monetary union. The plan involves options such as future bilateral rates for currencies involved in Emu, and conversion rates which would be announced in 1998. The plan does not, however, cover conversion rates between national currencies and the euro, which would not be fixed until 1999.</p>
<p>-- BUILDERS POISED FOR SOCIAL HOUSING BOOST</p>
<p>Labour has made plans to allocate over five billion stg in local capital receipts over the next five years to the construction industry for use in areas where social housing projects need funding the most. The government will apparently go against the policy of allowing councils to spend their own receipts, and propose their own methods of distribution as some councils currently hold more in receipts than others. London, the south-east and the Midlands are the areas in most need of funding.</p>
<p>-- SOUTH WEST ORDERS 30 NEW TRAINS</p>
<p>Britain's South West Trains has ordered 30 new trains from GEC Alsthom for a total of 90 million stg, the fourth order by the Stagecoach-owned franchise since its privatisation. The order is a reflection of a re-growth in train orders following the recent three-year dip caused by the sale of British Rail. GEC Alsthom has also recently benefited from a 100 million stg contract with Gatwick Express, a 200 million stg order from Tilbury &amp; Southend and a 34 million stg order from Chiltern Railways.</p>
<p>-- INTEL IS SUED OVER CHIP PATENTS</p>
<p>US computer firm Digital Equipment is to sue Intel over &quot;willful and deliberate infringement&quot; of its microprocessor patents. Intel, the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, reacted with shock as it had previously had close business ties with Digital, who are claiming that Intel unlawfully used its technology to achieve high performance in its Pentium microprocessor chips. If the suit is successful, the world's computer industry faces much disruption through Digital's prevention of further use of the chips in Intel products.</p>
<p>-- SHELL DEFENDS ETHICS ON EVE OF GENERAL MEETING</p>
<p>Royal Dutch/Shell will hold its annual general meeting in London on Wednesday amid great controversy concerning its environmental policies. In a Shell report published on Tuesday, the company defended accusations of human rights violations and pollution in the Niger River Delta, by stating they were making significant environmental progress. At the meeting, shareholders will be urged to vote in support of tightened environmental and human rights policies, as introduced by investors and the pension fund advisory service, which will be passed on to an independent external review and audit.</p>
<p>-- ICI PAYS PREMIUM FOR LOAN</p>
<p>Imperial Chemical Industries will be paying the highest-ever syndicated loan in Europe to finance its acquisition of Unilever's chemical business due to an exceptionally high interest rate premium. The debt will initially be serviced at four times the initial negotiated level, a rate of 0.55 percentage points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). ICI reportedly agreed to such terms as a reflection of the scale of the deal and risks attached to it and the deal allows the sale of the ICI loan in secondary debt markets.</p>
<p>-- GLITCHES REVEALED IN CORTECS DRUG TRIAL</p>
<p>UK biotechnology company Cortecs International has reported a successful trial on its Macrotonin drug used in the treatment of osteoporosis, a report which has met with international praise. Company chief executive Glenn Travers said that he was confident the successful trial was a significant step towards the approval of the drug in Europe, but added that data would be evaluated externally before being handed over to regulators. Analysts, meanwhile, have introduced doubt through disclosing that patients in one centre who received the drug reacted as well as patients at the same centre who received a placebo.</p>
