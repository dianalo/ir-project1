<p>The president of Chechnya said Russia was continuing its &quot;war&quot; against the breakaway region by means of an economic blockade and he would not demobilise his guerrilla army until Moscow signed a lasting peace treaty.</p>
<p>In an interview screened on Saturday by ORT television, Aslan Maskhadov said he was pressing Russian President Boris Yeltsin to conclude a peace treaty that would clearly set out relations between the secessionist administration and Moscow.</p>
<p>Yeltsin pulled Russian troops out of Chechnya after Maskhadov's several thousand-strong guerrilla force recaptured the capital Grozny last August after 20 months of fighting.</p>
<p>The two sides agreed a ceasefire but Maskhadov, who was elected president in January, said last week that months of talks on a lasting peace and economic compensation for the mainly Moslem Chechens had run into a dead end.</p>
<p>Maskhadov has insisted on full sovereignty for Chechnya. Moscow is prepared to grant only autonomy within Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;They are holding us to ransom. First Cossacks, then checkpoints, now a blockade. This too is war,&quot; Maskhadov told ORT, saying he was proposing a treaty defining relations on the basis of the ceasefire reached last August.</p>
<p>Security forces and ethnic Cossacks in neighbouring regions say they have stepped up controls on passage in and out of Chechnya. Russian media said more than 100 Chechen pilgrims on their way to Mecca had been turned back at the border with the Dagestan region on Friday because of passport problems.</p>
<p>Of Chechnya's guerrilla formations, estimated by some local leaders at around 5,000 men, Maskhadov said: &quot;They will be disbanded if we dot the &quot;i&quot;s on the treaty, that the war is over. I can't do it for now, because they aren't dotted yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The Chechen leader renewed his accusation that Russian special forces may be behind a recent series of kidnappings of Russian and foreign journalists and insisted he had full control over the region's many armed men.</p>
