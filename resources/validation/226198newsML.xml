<p>Recent selling pressure on gold has eclipsed any support offered to the yellow metal by Asian physical demand, which remained cowed by sharp price drops, traders in Hong Kong and Singapore said on Friday.</p>
<p>An optimistic outlook for improved physical demand in the fourth quarter from the World Gold Council's Hong Kong and South China manager Emily Li was countered by physical buyers made jittery by gold's price erosion, particularly in November.</p>
<p>&quot;We're anticipating (demand in) the fourth quarter will perform better,&quot; Li said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>But swift price drops have made end-users wary and hesitant demand has failed to counter selling pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;Physical demand here has fluctuated in the past months,&quot; said one Hong Kong-based bullion trader. &quot;It's there, but it's just not enough to counter selling pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>Gold has dropped from about $381.25 per ounce at the beginning of the month to around $371.75 towards the end, and Asian traders said they expected a further drop to $370.</p>
<p>On Friday, Hong Kong gold was trading at $371.75/372.25 per ounce at 1230 (0430 GMT), pushed down from its opening price of $371.90/372.40 by Japanese traders selling gold on a stronger dollar/yen, bullion traders said.</p>
<p>Dealers also reported both producer selling and buying.</p>
<p>&quot;There's strong buying support at $370 (an ounce), but that's what we said when gold fell past $380,&quot; one Singapore dealer said.</p>
<p>Jewellers around Asia were reporting that sales were down, according to Singapore-based industry sources.</p>
<p>&quot;People are holding back on spending. The Christmas mood is simply not there,&quot; one bullion dealer said.</p>
<p>Gold demand in China in third quarter 1996 was 53.7 tonnes, down six percent from the same period last year, according to the latest World Gold Council report tracking gold demand.</p>
<p>Demand in India in the third quarter also softened to about 114.1 tonnes, down four percent.</p>
<p>But a third quarter demand downturn in the region could reverse itself before the end of the calendar year, some said.</p>
<p>Strong last quarter support for gold will push up 1996 demand for the precious metal to match the all-time high of 2,725 tonnes achieved in 1995, said George Milling-Stanley, gold market analysis manager for the World Gold Council.</p>
<p>He was speaking on Thursday at a gold conference in New Delhi, India.</p>
<p>A Singapore trader said current gold prices have prompted buying from some jewellers uncertain about the metal's next move, but optimistic about demand improving eventually.</p>
<p>&quot;I bought some gold to make sure I have enough stocks because I expect demand to pick up from the second week of December and into Chinese New Year (in February, 1997),&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>A strong Australian dollar and South African rand has made gold weaker in those currencies, triggering both buying and selling as mines struggle to adapt their different hedging strategies.</p>
<p>&quot;It really depends on the producer's goals and their individual needs, but overall, there has been more producer selling than buying,&quot; said a senior Hong Kong-based gold source.</p>
<p>Singapore gold premiums were quoted steady in a range between 40-50 U.S. cents an ounce over spot London prices, dealers said.</p>
