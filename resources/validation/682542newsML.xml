<p>South African industrial shares ended firm in active trade on Tuesday after recovering from an early slide spurred by Wall Street's slip on Monday night, dealers said.</p>
<p>Enjoying the bouyancy driven into the market by a steady rand and a slightly firmer local bond market were clothing firm Towles, Edgar Jacobs (TEJ) Ltd which ended at a new year high of 750 cents after the stock added 450 cents amid news of its planned restructuring.</p>
<p>&quot;The day has amounted to a reasonably good day with our market closing firm. We've had no effect from the fall on Wall Street,&quot; Tracey Ledger an equities trader at stockbroking firm BOE Natwest Securities told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Our relationship with Wall Street at the moment is very tenous,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The industrial index added 55.4 points to reach 8,624.2 at close and the all-share index was up 47.3 points at 7,333.6.  </p>
<p>The Johannesburg Stock Exchange said the all-share index was at an all time closing high. The industrial index was also at its highest since January 25, 1996 when it was at 8,739.2 points.</p>
<p>The Dow on Monday recorded its second-largest point decline ever on Monday, finishing down 192.25 points to 7,604.26 following comments from Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto that Japan could sell U.S. Treasuries and switch funds to gold.</p>
<p>But Japan's Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka on Tuesday tried to difuse the impact of Hashimoto's comments, saying the prime minister had been incorrectly reported.</p>
<p>Wall Street was last up 44.10 points at 7,648.</p>
<p>&quot;Industrials are holding up very well considering the Dow's plummet overnight. I think people expected them to correct slightly, but they've continued their pattern from yesterday afternoon,&quot; another dealer at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) added.</p>
<p>Gold failed to follow much of the positive trend of the industrials and continued on shaky ground to end steady as the bullion price remained weak, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The gold market is still under pressure. The gold price tried to test $340 an ounce level this morning and bounced right off it and subsequently the shares have come in under a bit of pressure,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The gold index finished at 3.5 points higher at 1,018.6.  </p>
<p>Dealers said also defying gloom was the market's financial sector which continued to roar to new territory on Tuesday as the financial index closed at an all-time high of 10,080.1.</p>
<p>The JSE said the previous high of 9,973 was recorded on Monday, June 23.</p>
<p>&quot;The banks (and the financials sector) just don't want to stop. This...sector has been firm for months now. I'm not entirely sure why, but I think it's possibly on the rate cut talk,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>But individual shares in the banking and financials sector finished mixed with Standard Bank ending up 650 cents at 216.50 rand, First National Bank down 20 cents at 40.75 rand and Nedbank down 50 cents at 99.50 rand.  </p>
<p>Granite producing firm Marlin Corp Ltd ended three cents higher at 60 cents  following a bookover deal worth around 7.5 million rand by stockbroking firm Martindale Stacey du Toit.</p>
<p>Alan Momberg, a dealer at Martindale Stacey, said the bookover deal had involved 12.9 million shares.</p>
<p>Furniture group Ellerine Holdings Ltd was unchanged at 31.25 rand with volume of 3.3 million shares valued at 103.6 million rand following an asset swap deal, Ledger said.</p>
<p>On the gold board Driefontein ended down five cents at 31.80 rand, Vaal down 150 cents at 234.50 rand and Kloof up 55 cents at 27.25 rand.</p>
<p>Dealers said South African share futures, which started softer on Tuesday after Wall St plunges overnight, had finished slightly firmer, off their early lows despite some profit taking.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is closing slightly firmer but not as strong as I though it would be given the run on the equities side. It's probably just jobbers just selling and taking off profits,&quot; one futures trader said.</p>
<p>The all-share September contract was last at 6,705/40 from 6,709 settlement, the gold contract at 709/11 from 730 settlement and the industrial contract at 8,390/97 from 8,335.</p>
