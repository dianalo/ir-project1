<headline>U.S. MUNI FOCUS--prices ease, outpacing Treasuries.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-21</dateline>

<p>U.S. municipal bonds at midday Wednesday were pegged from unchanged to down an eighth to a quarter of a point in spots, as the market resisted some of the downward pressure exerted by Treasury bonds.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say it's off, probably no more than a quarter of a point, probably an eighth to a quarter of a point on generic, dollar bonds,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>New York City, whose $739 million of general obligation bonds was the deal of the week, saw its debt priced with a top yield of six percent in 2016, according to Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>Traders said that while retail interest might have been dampened during the presale period by concerns about whether the Federal Reserve would raise rates when its policy-makers met on Tuesday, they expected the offering to go fairly smoothly. The central bank left interest rates unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought it (New York City) was priced right, I thought the adjustment on the insured (portion) was good, I put in for a lot of bonds,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Still, he cautioned that because the offering, a refunding, is made up of serial not term bonds, it might be a bit more difficult to trade in the secondary market.</p>
<p>A shortfall of municipal bonds was one of the main reasons cited for the market's recent ability to outperform Treasuries.</p>
<p>The Standard and Poor's Corp Blue List, a yardstick of secondary supply, stood at almost $1.1 billion, a fairly lean level.</p>
<p>Traders said the municipal market's resilience was working against it in at least one respect: individual investors, who expected to prices to be marked down as much as Treasury bonds displayed little interest at the present levels.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very hard to tell clients municipals are not cheaper when they see governments go down,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Treasury bonds firmed from lows after falling sharply when the U.S. trade gap came in much narrower than expected, sliding 19.3 percent to $8.51 billion. This was well below forecasts for a $10.3 billion gap seen in a Reuters consensus poll of economists.</p>
<p>A Chase Securities Inc economist, noting exports were higher than anticipated, said he now expected the first quarter Gross Domestic Product to be revised up, with a less unfavorable outlook for trade in the second quarter.</p>
<p>June municipal bond futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade slipped five ticks to 116-18/32, while the June U.S. Treasury bonds lost 11 ticks to 109-16/32. This left the MOB spread at a robust plus 226 ticks, roughly 10 ticks stronger than on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Alliance Airport Authority Inc Texas Special Facilities Revenues of 2021, which pay a 6-3/8 percent coupon, were bid at 101-3/8, up an eighth of a point.</p>
<p>And Dade County, Florida, Water and Sewer System Revenus of 2025, which have a 5-1/2 percent coupon, were bid at 5.70 percent, down two basis points.</p>
