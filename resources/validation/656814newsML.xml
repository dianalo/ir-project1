<p>U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said Thursday he expected Congress would pass a bill later in the day to provide disaster assistance for more than 30 states but said he had few details on the deal being worked out to clear the embattled legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's very likely that we will finish our work on this bill today,&quot; Daschle, of South Dakota, told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I&quot;m just an optimist.  It just seems to me we ought to get it done today,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>With tentative agreements to remove the two most contentious add-on items from the bill, Daschle said he did not expect haggling over funding -- which had not been an issue before -- would stall the bill further.</p>
<p>Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott Wednesday said there was tentative agreement among Republicans to strip political riders from the bill to prevent a government shut-down this fall in case of a budget impasse and to restrict the 2000 census to a house-by-house count.  </p>
<p>Democrats opposed those measures, saying Republicans were trying to boost their budget negotiating leverage and were pushing a census method that would undercount minorities and poorer people.</p>
<p>While Lott indicated the disaster bill would be about one-third smaller than the original $8.6 billion measure, Daschle said Democrats will insist that no money be cut from the assistance for his state and others that sustained floods and other disasters.</p>
<p>&quot;Not one dime of disaster assistance will be taken out of this bill,&quot; he said.  But he said Democrats were willing to look at proposals to roll some other funds into the next fiscal year in order to move the bill.</p>
<p>Daschle said Democrats would continue to hold up other Senate action until the disaster bill was passed.</p>
