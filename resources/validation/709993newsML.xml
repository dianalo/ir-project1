<title>SOUTH AFRICA: S.Africa rand/bonds closing report.</title>
<headline>S.Africa rand/bonds closing report.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1997-07-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>The bond market's 80-point freefall over the last three weeks came to a halt on Monday as the market consolidated its recent gains and local players took profits.</p>
<p>By 1400 GMT, the benchmark R150 loan had moved up to a 14.195 percent yield from 14.10 percent at Friday's close.</p>
<p>Since June 18, the yield has fallen from a high of 14.88 percent to a low of 14.05 percent on July 3, primarily on the back of expectations of a cut in official interest rates in the second half of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Today the market took a breather after its run over the last few weeks,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Selling appeared to come mainly from local jobbers, with New York and London-based players buying selectively as the market weakened, dealers said.</p>
<p>The market was also concerned about the rand, traders said, which weakened on the back of concerns about the ailing gold price.</p>
<p>It was last trading at 4.5355/5385 against the dollar from 4.5265/5295 late on Friday.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange traders said concerns about what impact the gold price would have on the South African economy triggered early importer dollar demand as well as short-covering, but that activity after that was muted.</p>
<p>&quot;We weakened on the back of the lower gold price. There was a quick flurry up but nothing after that,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Small offshore sales of dollars and technical factors provided resistance at the 4.54 level.</p>
<p>The gold price plumbed fresh 12-year lows on Monday as the market contined to feed off news that the Reserve Bank of Australia sold 167 tonnes of the metal in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>Bullion was fixed at $318.00 an ounce in London on Monday afternoon -- its weakest level since December 1985.</p>
<p>Economists said that while the fall in the gold price would trim both export earnings and the valuation of the country's gold reserves, the main impact would be on job creation.</p>
<p>&quot;Unemployment will suffer because if the rand/gold price stays at these levels, we could see job losses as a result of the closure of marginal shafts.&quot;</p>
<p>The randgold price was trading at a fresh 18-month low of 1,4445 in late trade.  </p>
<p>The rand was also under pressure against sterling on the day, as cable staged a fresh attempt at hurdling the 1.69 level.</p>
<p>In late trade, the rand was quoted at 7.6404/6500 against sterling from 7.6363/6459 late on Friday.</p>
<p>Against the mark, it was quoted firmer at 0.3842/3845 marks from 0.3872/3876 marks, but weaker against the Japanese currency at 24.7318/7702 yen from 25.0806/1193 yen previously.</p>
<p>Dealers said that on Tuesday both the rand and bond markets were expected to weaken further.</p>
<p>Bond yields could test 14.30 percent before resuming the bull trend which traders said remained intact, while forex dealers said the rand could stage an assault on the 4.55 level as concerns about the gold price lingered.</p>
<p>On the money market, three-month NCDs were steady at between 15.65 to 15.70 percent offered, while the 90-day BA rate was also unmoved at between 15.25 and 15.10 percent.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank quoted the money market shortage lower at 5.781 billion rand on Saturday from 5.797 billion rand on Friday.</p>
<p>Bond Exchange figures showed foreigners were net buyers of 1.02 billion rand's worth of South African bonds on Friday after buying 156.16 million rand's worth on Thursday.</p>
<p>Nominal cumulative volumes stood at 11 billion rand on Friday.</p>
