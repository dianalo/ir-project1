<text>
<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said the 28-day Exchange Fund bills tendered on Thursday were undersubscribed.</p>
<p>Bids for the HK$5.0 billion issue totalled only HK$3.25 billion against HK$5.72 billion in the previous tender, it said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the result was not surprising, although it was uncommon for government paper, since many market makers were still on holiday and the accepted yields looked unattractive.</p>
<p>The average accepted yield of the shortest bills at today's tender was 4.40 percent against the average accepted yield of 4.34 percent in the previous tender on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Dealers would rather buy bonds in the secondary market than making a bid as some participants believed that it's bad luck to take such low yield paper at the beginning of the year,&quot; one bond dealer said.</p>
<p>One-month HIBOR settled at 0330 gmt was 5.36979 percent.</p>
<p>The issue was the roll-over of the third batch of special one-month Exchange Fund bills issued to facilitate the implementation of the real-time settlement system in early December.</p>
<p>But the tender size had been trimmed down from HK$10 billion. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6369</p>
