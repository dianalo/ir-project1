<p>Ecuadorean President Fabian Alarcon said on Monday he had accepted the resignations of his ministers for health and public works.</p>
<p>He told reporters that Health Minister Guillermo Wagner would be replaced by Asdrubal de la Torre and Public Works Minister Estuardo Hidalgo by Homero Torres.</p>
<p>The changes were made to &quot;make the government more dynamic,&quot; Alarcon said.</p>
<p>The other cabinet members were confirmed in their positions, he said.</p>
<p>Following local tradition, the entire cabinet resigned last week after a referendum in which Ecuadoreans voted to confirm the presidency of Alarcon.</p>
<p>Alarcon was appointed interim president until August 1998 by Congress in February, after former President Abdala Bucaram was deposed on grounds of &quot;mental incapacity.&quot;</p>
