<p>Lifters of Nigerian crudes are complaining a build-up of unsold cargoes and slack demand will hit balance sheets hard in March as spot markets plummet sharply below contract prices.</p>
<p>Traders on Thursday estimated around 28 cargoes of West African crudes, including up to eight Nigerian Forcados and seven Qua Iboe, remained unsold for March, equivalent to about a million barrels per day of supply for the remainder of the month.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of stems of Nigerian that will not move at anywhere close to OSP (official selling price) and lifters are not happy,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of people trying to work a miracle on Forcados, which is really suffering,&quot; another said.</p>
<p>Forcados, priced by state Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC) at Dated Brent +47 cents for March, is currently valued on the spot market at anywhere between a 10 cent discount to a 10 cent premium to the international benchmark.</p>
<p>Assessments of a 20 cent discount to Brent were seen as a buyer's level but lifters still faced a half a million dollar loss for each 950,000 barrel cargo.</p>
<p>Bonny Light was assessed by several traders at around Dated +40 cents, around 18 cents adrift from its March contract price.</p>
<p>NNPC normally seeks to set crude contract prices at about 11 cents below spot market values to cover business costs and profits.</p>
<p>Nigeria sells some 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude through about 30 contracts with traders and refiners, adjusting prices every month according to NNPC's assessment of the spot market.</p>
<p>Traders said the March overhang consisted of up to eight cargoes of Nigerian Forcados, two Bonny Light, three of Brass River, two Escravos and seven Qua Iboe, including a combination cargo with a Guinean Zafiro. It also included four Gabonese Rabi and two Angolan Cabinda</p>
<p>Some lifters have said an approach might be made, either directly or indirectly, to NNPC to lower some contract prices.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a bit of lobbying going on to have the OPSs varied,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>But others said the most NNPC might offer in response was an undertaking to consider lowering April prices in due course to reflect any losses suffered by customers on March barrels.</p>
<p>NNPC in the recent past is not known to have revised contract terms.</p>
<p>&quot;Lowering prices in mid-stream is not totally without precedent but it has not happened in the recent past,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;If they do it at all they will do it in April, not March. If people get hurt in one month, they will give it back later.&quot;</p>
<p>NNPC was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Demand for West African grades has withered on a combination of factors, market analysts say.</p>
<p>These include a relatively mild winter in the United States which has led to a lower than expected demand for heating oil. This in turn has hit demand for distillate-rich grades such as Forcados.</p>
<p>There have also been incremental increases in crude production around the world, the most notable example being the resumption of limited exports by Iraq. And there has been a higher than normal programme of refinery maintenance on the east coast of the United States, the biggest consumer of Nigerian crude.</p>
<p>Traders recalled that NNPC resisted similar pressure for a reduction in contract prices that built in a weak market for December loadings.</p>
<p>But they added that NNPC's position then was assisted by the prospect of a stronger market ahead of the northern hemisphere winter. And prices had not slumped as far as they have now.</p>
<p>NNPC said in November that published price assessments showed margins for profits and costs over the previous year at about 13 cents a barrel for their main grades.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment there is no upside on the horizon and we are suffering now more than we did then,&quot; one contract holder said. &quot;And when April comes, NNPC will have to assess the market at that time, and how much they take account of the losses in March is open to question.&quot;</p>
<p>But another cautioned: &quot;What you want to be careful of is that the market gets so bearish that buyers keeping hanging on for the lower numbers, and one day you suddenly find the market turned upwards again.&quot;</p>
