<p>Belgian speech technology firm Lernout &amp; Hauspie Speech Products NV (L&amp;H) said on Tuesday it plans to offer an automatic translation service on the Internet by the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Internet wants to keep growing, the language problem must be solved,&quot; L&amp;H president Gaston Bastiaens said.</p>
<p>Bastiaens told a news conference that the number of Internet users is expected to mushroom from 27 million today to 170 million by the year 2000, but only if it becomes accessible to non-English language speakers.</p>
<p>He estimated that more than 90 percent of what is currently on offer on the net is in English.</p>
<p>The L&amp;H translator will allow users to enter searches in their own language. The translator, integrated in a browser application, will then provide a rough translation of the search result, accurate enough to render the meaning of the text.</p>
<p>&quot;Only few translation machines reach an accuracy level of more than 80 percent, but that is enough to see whether the source text is interesting,&quot; Bastiaens said.</p>
<p>Using a click button, users can then switch to L&amp;H's &quot;human&quot; translation unit Mendez to order perfect translations.</p>
<p>L&amp;H plans to charge customers a flat fee which will allow unlimited acces to machine translations. Asked about the cost, Bastiaens said: &quot;$10 per month would be a viable price.&quot;</p>
<p>L&amp;H bought Mendez Translations in September 1996 for $16.9 million and has since acquired three other translation firms.</p>
<p>Bastiaens said machine translations would dramatically alter the nature of the translation business, currently a &quot;scattered cottage industry ripe for consolidation&quot;.</p>
<p>Mendez, which had 1996 turnover of $32 million, is the world's second-largest translation company. Bastiaens estimated the translation market was worth $2.5 billion per year.</p>
<p>Bastiaens is the former CEO of Quarterdeck Corp , who joined L&amp;H in October.</p>
<p>Jo Lernout, one of L&amp;H 's founders, said that, for now, L&amp;H did not plan a speech interface on the Internet translator.</p>
<p>But he demonstrated various other L&amp;H speech technology applications, including one which allows users to have their computer read out e-mail. The application is steered by voice.</p>
<p>Lernout described how soon it will be possible to tell the mobile phone in your car to call the office, connect to the computer and have it read out your e-mail while you drive.</p>
<p>Bastiaens quoted Microsoft chairman Bill Gates as saying speech technology is the computer interface of the future.</p>
<p>&quot;Computers will not only be in our offices, but in our houses, our cars, our appliances. It will be impossible to know all the buttons and commands for all these tools. We need to be able to speak to the computer,&quot; Bastiaens said.</p>
<p>Last year Microsoft chose L&amp;H's text-to-speech technology as the linguistic standard in software development.</p>
<p>L&amp;H was founded in 1987 and now employs some 500 people.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq-listed group said earlier 1996 revenue quadrupled to $31.01 million. Pre-tax profit before write-offs rose to $24.33 million from $5.23 million. Group net loss narrowed to $7.94 million from $13.98 million.</p>
