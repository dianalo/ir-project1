<p>French financial futures markets tumbled in unusually heavy pre-session electronic trading on Monday after the combined left outpolled the centre-right coalition in the first round of France's parliamentary election on Sunday night.</p>
<p>The franc also fell, slipping to 3.3770 per mark, through its low of 3.3755 per mark reached late on Sunday night after first projections by polling institutes showed the left solidly ahead of the right.  </p>
<p>May CAC-40 stock market futures showed an equally sharp drop, indicating a Paris bourse opening as much as three percent lower. The bourse opens at 0800 GMT.</p>
<p>June PIBOR futures opened 17 basis points lower at 96.30 and kept falling, slumping as much as 25 basis points and staying weak. Bond futures were hit equally hard, with the June contract dropping as low as 128.28, 72 ticks off from its ending level on Friday. PIBOR and bond futures pit trading starts at 0630 GMT.</p>
<p>Traders said there was initial selling by domestic and foreign investors, but dealers positioned in advance for a fall were buying contracts to cash in profits and this was stabilising the markets for now.</p>
<p>Three major French polling institutions all put the combined Socialist, Communist and left-wing allies ahead in percentage of the vote and in projections of National Assembly seats after the first round. The second round of the election is set for June 1.</p>
