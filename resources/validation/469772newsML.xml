<p>One of Germany's top economic research institutes said on Wednesday it expected total tax revenues to fall short of target this year, but still revised down its forecast for the budget deficit ratio to GDP.</p>
<p>Economist Alfred Boss said the IfW expected tax revenues to fall 15 billion marks ($8.9 billion) below target. The next revenue estimates, compiled by an independent commission, are due in May.</p>
<p>But Boss told Reuters his institute was still revising down its forecast for the budget deficit to 3.3 percent of GDP from an earlier view of 3.5 percent.</p>
<p>That forecast exceeds the three percent goal set by the Maastricht treaty for countries to hit this year if they are to be judged eligible to join European monetary union in 1999.</p>
<p>Germany has insisted on a strict interpretation of the treaty, but Boss said he was sure European leaders would use the leeway written into its text allowing states to miss the target as long as they were moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>&quot;European monetary union will definitely not fail over the German deficit,&quot; Boss told Reuters.</p>
<p>Boss said that the IfW had revised its deficit forecast because of changes made by Germany's Federal Statistics Office to final figures for 1996. The total public sector deficit was 3.9 percent of GDP last year.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel warned last weekend that cuts in social security payments and even tax increases may be needed to help meet the government borrowing target.</p>
<p>But he said it would not be clear whether action would have to be taken until the independent forecasts which underpin budget forecasts are readied in April and the tax estimates are finalised a month later.</p>
<p>Last November's tax estimates revised down the revenue projections by 10 billion marks for this year, piling pressure on the government to pass reforms to the tax system designed to close dozens of loopholes which have hit the tax take.</p>
<p>A deficit of three percent of GDP would work out at 110 billion marks this year, based on official figures.</p>
<p>Separately, the Berliner Zeitung said in extracts from an article to be published on Thursday, that the DIW institute in Berlin expected tax revenues this year to fall five billion marks short of target.</p>
