<p>Monetary policy is the theme this week, with financial markets focused on the U.S. and Germany for further hints on the direction of interest rates.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testifies on the state of the U.S. economy on Tuesday, providing what analysts say will be the week's pivotal point for markets.</p>
<p>In the wake of a batch of strong economic numbers, bond investors will be wary of Greenspan's tone, fearing that upbeat comments may suggest an interest rate rise is looming.</p>
<p>&quot;If anything, he will hint at the possibility of a tightening somewhat earlier than some people had been expecting at the end of last year,&quot; said Adrian Schmidt, international economist at Chase in London.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of that is already priced into the market now, but people will still get a bit nervous.&quot;</p>
<p>In Europe, German M3 money supply data are likely to kick start data releases today, teaming up with Italian cities' consumer prices due today and Tuesday to ensure the focus there too is on interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;December's M3 is likely to lend further supprt to the view that monetary tightening is off the agenda this year -- and possibly next year too,&quot; said David Brickman, European econmoist at Yamaichi International in London.</p>
<p>Yamaichi is forecasting a fall in M3 headline growth,taking the rate to 7.6 percent from 8.0 percent in November -- a figure that would still leave M3 outside the 1996 Bundesbank target range of 4.0-7.0 percent and its 1997 target band of 3.5-6.5 percent.</p>
<p>The numbers are expected to support German Bund prices, dragging other European debt markets higher.</p>
<p>With the markets back on Bundesbank watch after Council member Hans-Juergen Krupp's remarks last week about the weakness in the German economy, the fortnightly council meeting should spark a little more interest than it has of late.</p>
<p>But Chase's Schmidt said that while Italy may well see an interest rate easing in the week ahead, the chances of a German easing were extremely slim.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bundesbank has made it clear that they expect money supply to weaken over the year as it is, and with the mark as weak as it has been recently, that is another reason not to expect a rate cut,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The December IFO survey of the German business climate is due for release on Tuesday and producer and import price data for December are expected later in the week.</p>
<p>In France, markets will digest housing data, consumer spending and prices, trade and industrial production numbers.</p>
<p>UK financial markets will be on their toes at the start of the week, handling M0 and M4 money supply, new construction orders and mortgage data as well as the Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) trends survey on Tuesday, followed by retail sales on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Analysts expect retail sales to be relatively subdued and say the CBI survey is likely to give a lively picture of economic growth in Britain but also show signs of the impact of the recent rally in sterling.</p>
<p>&quot;Our forecast is for December retail sales only up 0.1 percent on the month,&quot; said Rob Hayward, economic advisor at BankAmerica in London. &quot;People have started to perceive that the Christmas sales figures were not as strong as previously thought, and the market is starting to accept that perhaps interest rates will not have to rise at this point,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In a poll conducted by Reuters, analysts predicted retail sales will be up 0.3 percent on the month, after a 0.7 percent November rise. -- International Bond Unit +44 171 5428682</p>
