<p>Moslem rebels killed 34 people in southern Algeria and on Wednesday broke into a training school, shot dead a woman teacher and wounded five other people in a resurgence of violence in the North African country.</p>
<p>Algerian independent newspapers, in detailed accounts of the slaughter of the 34 on Monday night, said 20 were passengers on a bus, forced to get out. They were then slaughtered one by one by having their throats slit.</p>
<p>In the latest killing, Algerian security forces said a &quot;terrorist group&quot; broke into the vocational training school in the small community of Ouled Aich, near the garrison town of Blida, 50 km (30 miles) south of Algiers.</p>
<p>In a statement carried by the official Algerian news agency APS they said the woman teacher was gunned down at 2.10 p.m (1310 GMT) and that among those wounded was a girl pupil.</p>
<p>Monday night's ambush was carried out at a road block with Moslem guerrillas disguised as security forces. The official death toll given earlier for the attack was nine.</p>
<p>The slaughter, among the bloodiest reported in nearly five years of violence, took place south of the Saharan desert town of Laghouat.</p>
<p>It was near a turnoff for Hassi R'mel, Algeria's biggest gas field, where many foreign energy experts work and which is one of the &quot;no-go&quot; zones for which an official pass is needed.</p>
<p>Liberte newspaper said: &quot;A score of terrorists mounted a false road check for more than one hour near Bouterkfine, 50 km (30 miles) south of Laghouat...near the road leading to Hassi R'mel.</p>
<p>&quot;Passengers of a bus were told to get out for identity checks which turned into a nightmare. One by one their throats were coldly slit.</p>
<p>&quot;Some hostages tried to flee. Some were shot by the terrorists and then finished off and mutilated with knives.&quot;</p>
<p>Liberte also said the guerrillas stopped an ambulance, killing the driver, a nurse and the husband of a sick woman.</p>
<p>The civilian death toll was the highest reported in the region since an attack last year at Anfous in which 18 people were killed and 15 wounded.</p>
<p>Le Matin newspaper said troops had been sent to the region in a huge manhunt to search towns and villages.</p>
<p>Another independent newspaper, El Khabar, said 20 people on the bus were killed. Others were in a lorry and cars.</p>
<p>Road checks by troops, gendarmerie or police are a common occurrence in the North African country where an estimated 50,000 people have been killed since 1992.</p>
<p>According to Liberte, the guerrillas were acting under the orders of local guerrilla chief Mokhtar Mokhtari, a veteran of the Afhan war and deputy of Habbi Miloud, alias Abou El Walid.</p>
<p>Miloud broke away from the feared Armed Islamic Group (GIA) some months ago after a dispute with GIA leader Djamel Zitouni who was reported to have been killed in July.</p>
<p>The GIA has proved to be one of the most ruthless of the armed Moslem groups who have been trying to topple the authorities since they cancelled a general election in 1992 in which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had taken a commanding lead.</p>
