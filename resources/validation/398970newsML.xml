<p>The deputy director general of Indonesia's national atomic energy agency (Batan) said on Monday he was optimistic that the government would approve the construction of a nuclear power station in Java.</p>
<p>&quot;From the various studies constucted to date, it can be concluded that nuclear power has a very good prospect in Indonesia,&quot; Agar Djaloeis told a uranium conference here.</p>
<p>Djaloeis said rapid depletion of Indonesia's hydrocarbon reserves, together with environmental considerations, indicated that both nuclear and coal-fired power stations presented the country with an optimal solution to its long-term power needs.  </p>
<p>Political opposition to the nuclear plant was not seen as a serious matter, Djaloeis said. There were some strong voices against the nuclear plant by a &quot;very small minority,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But to a large extent, our people are not educated enough to assess the pros and cons of nuclear power,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said he believed that in the &quot;silent majority&quot; there was pratically no significant voice in opposition to nuclear power.</p>
<p>The nuclear plant, Indonesia's first, is proposed for the Ujung Lemah Abang area on the northern part of the Muria Peninsula in the northern coast of central Java, he said.  </p>
<p>Djaloeis said the nearby volcanic Muria mountain had been inactive for 320 years and posed no threat.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now waiting for a government assessment of the feasibility study,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The government will decide in consulation with the parliament on whether to give the green or red light,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's green then a share of Indonesia's power generation will go to nuclear,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Djaloeis said the plant, if approved, would require between 120 and 180 tonnes of uranium a year.  </p>
<p>It is foreseen that the nuclear power plant would have the capacity to generate 7,200 megawatts by 2015, he said.</p>
<p>at Westinghouse Electric Co, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd and Samsung Corp had started a feasibilty study to introduce a nuclear power station on a build/own/operate basis, Djaloeis said.</p>
<p>General Electric Co and Atomic Energy of Canada-SNC/Lavalin of Canada had arranged different studies, he added.</p>
