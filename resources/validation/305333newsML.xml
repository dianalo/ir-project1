<p>NARODNA OBRODA - Dealers said the central bank should make public its ideas on the level of interest rates on the interbank market to calm the current turbulent situation resulting in rates at over 20 percent.</p>
<p>- National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) spokesman Jan Onda said the current development in the interbank money market rates was in line with expectations in the central bank's monetary plans for this year.</p>
<p>- The Slovak government will discuss the strategy of restructuring the banking sector at its regular session on Tuesday. The plan should include long-awaited measures allowing exemption of interest income from classified loans from the banks' tax payments.</p>
<p>- The government is also scheduled to discuss creation of a national airline.</p>
<p>HOSPODARSKE NOVINY - The NBS said its primary aim was to control growth of the key money measure, M2, and its inflationary pressures. Present monetary plans, unlike in the recent past, require a closer look at quantitative rather than qualitative factors, which are interest rates, the NBS said.</p>
<p>- According to preliminary figures, Slovakia's income from tourism totalled $750 million last year, compared with about $560 million in 1995.</p>
<p>- Heavy-engineering company ZTS Sabinov will issue a 100 million crown tranche of five-year bonds on January 24. The coupon rate was set at 14 percent per annum in the first year and at the Bratislava Interbank Offer Rate (BRIBOR) plus 0.95 percent in the remaining four years.</p>
<p>SME - The government is expected to discuss the planned resignation of Transport Minister Alexander Rezes today.</p>
<p>- Jan Carnogursky, leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) said Slovakia should approach NATO membership at a slower pace in order to create more space for discussions about NATO enlargement both in the west and the east.</p>
<p>- Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar said Slovaks should decide on integration into NATO in a referendum. Meciar said the government would initiate a public discussion and information campaign on the question.</p>
