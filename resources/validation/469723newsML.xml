<title>FRANCE: French parliament committee adopts sex crime bill.</title>
<headline>French parliament committee adopts sex crime bill.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-03-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>A French parliamentary committee adopted a bill to reinforce existing legislation punishing sex crimes and the dissemination of pornography on Wednesday.</p>
<p>If finally approved, the legislation would force offenders to undergo treatment with the aim of preventing recidivism. It would also deprive sex offenders of routine prison sentence reductions.</p>
<p>France is in the grip of a wave of concern over sex crimes against children in the aftermath of high profile cases in Belgium and France, including the rape and strangulation last summer of 13-year-old British schoolgirl Caroline Dickinson while on a trip to France.</p>
<p>The bill, presented to the national assembly's (lower house) laws committee by Justice Minister Jacques Toubon, will be examined by the full assembly in a first reading from April 23.</p>
<p>It would establish a national database of information to make it easier to identify and find sexual offenders.</p>
<p>Adopted by the committee with many amendments increasing the severity of the centre-right government's original proposal, it stipulates a life sentence for rapists who murder or torture their victims, whatever their age.</p>
<p>Existing legislation demands a life sentence only when the victim is under 15. The bill would also provide harsher financial penalties for disseminating child pornography.</p>
<p>It would prohibit the establishment or force the closure of sex shops within 500 metres of schools, playgrounds or cultural centres.</p>
