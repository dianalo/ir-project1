<p>Sunday's deadly grenade attack has sent jitters though Cambodia's business community and could stall new foreign investment for months, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our economy is so fragile now, this is the last thing we needed,&quot; said Tep Rithivit, a Cambodian-Canadian business consultant whose firm represents foreign corporations here.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is very concerned it will have long-term repercussions. We're worried the story may not stop here.&quot;</p>
<p>At least 14 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in the attack on opposition demonstrators in front of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Police said four grenades were thrown into a crowd of up to 200 protesting against alleged corruption in the judiciary.</p>
<p>Protest leader and apparent target Sam Rainsy, who narrowly escaped injury, on Sunday blamed the attack on his bitter foe, co-Premier Hun Sen. But a spokesman for the Information Ministry said it was unclear who was responsible and that an investigation was under way.</p>
<p>For many investors, the attack was a reminder that four years into democratic and economic reforms, Cambodia remains a risky place to do business.</p>
<p>Security and political instability, exacerbated by the rivalry of co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, compound the challenges of an incomplete commercial code, corruption and war-scarred infrastructure, analysts said.</p>
<p>Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP) formed an uneasy coalition government with the royalist FUNCINPEC after U.N.-organised elections in 1993. The next general elections are due to be held in November 1998.</p>
<p>Political strains have already led to the annulment of three contracts with the country's largest investor, Ariston Sdn Bhd of Malaysia.</p>
<p>Diplomats and business representatives said they had received numerous phone calls from worried investors and prospective investors since Sunday's attack. Several delegations had cancelled trips to Cambodia and companies with expatriate staff were worried about security, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;People will be scared away for six months,&quot; said one Association of Southeast Asian Nations diplomat. &quot;But it's cyclical here, and people have short attention spans.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that while ASEAN would likely not delay Cambodia's expected entry this year, the incident would raise eyebrows among its neighbours.</p>
<p>&quot;I think what happened will generate a lot of questions,&quot; a second diplomat said.</p>
<p>ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The seven agreed last year that Cambodia, Laos and Burma would be admitted at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;We're concerned,&quot; said Edgar Chua, whose Shell Co of Cambodia Ltd has invested $50 million in Cambodia. &quot;But we're still assessing (to see) if it is an isolated incident or a sign of things to come.&quot;</p>
<p>Some analysts said it could take months to know the full damage to Cambodia, which is anxious to lure business to rebuild a economy with a per capita gross domestic product of less than $300 a year.</p>
<p>Richard Hines, national chief executive for Societe Generale de Surveillance of Switzerland, said the attack was &quot;the worst in a while&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It may be expected as elections (approach),&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone's obviously watching very closely.&quot;</p>
