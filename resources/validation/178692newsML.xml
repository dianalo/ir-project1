<p>The first-time sale of shares in telephone giant Deutsche Telekom AG this month is set to become Europe's largest-ever listing, worth some $10 billion, and has whipped up stock fever among normally cautious Germans.</p>
<p>When shares begin trading on stock markets around the world on November 18, Telekom's long, gruelling transition from a stodgy state bureaucracy to a dynamic multinational company in one of the fastest-growing industries will come to a close.</p>
<p>As many as 575 million Deutsche Telekom shares, expected to be priced at around 30 marks ($19.90), will be floated on stock markets in Germany, New York, Tokyo and could eventually be issued in Hong Kong, Singapore and elsewhere around the globe.</p>
<p>As the deadline for orders from private investors at special discounts passed, observers predicted the issue could be oversubscribed as much as five times.</p>
<p>&quot;The massive response from private investors, combined with the interest shown by institutional investors, convinces me that the flotation of Deutsche Telekom will be a genuine success,&quot; chief executive Ron Sommer said.</p>
<p>When Finance Minister Theo Waigel disclosed plans in 1992 to privatise Telekom, he said it could become &quot;the people's share of the '90s,&quot; in a reference to previousc flotations of industry giants Veba and Volkswagen in the heyday of Germany's post-war economic miracle.</p>
<p>Telekom resorted to a hard sell with a splashy television advertising campaign using actor Manfred Krug, the German &quot;Columbo&quot; of TV detectives, telling millions of prime-time couch potatoes it would be foolish to miss out on the offer.</p>
<p>The message hit home. More than three million private investors have shed long-held aversions to the risks of buying shares and registered with Telekom.</p>
<p>Thew company gave Germans plenty of reasons to get in on the act. Anyone who buys a &quot;T-share&quot; will get a dividend of 60 pfennigs for 1996 and 1.20 marks for 1997. Anyone who keeps shares for three years will get one new share for every 10 held.</p>
<p>More than twice as many Germans signed up for Telekom's flotation as Britons for British Telecom's hugely successful listing 12 years ago.</p>
<p>The listing could become the watershed event that Germany has longed for to yank its provincial stock markets on to the international stage. Just 5.5 percent of Germans own shares now, compared to 17.5 percent of Britons and 21 percent of Americans.</p>
<p>Broadening the base of share ownership would also benefit the economy as a whole and especially young, innovative start-up companies by making it easier to find financing.</p>
<p>&quot;The privatisation of Telekom is good for the whole share market,&quot; said Werner Seifert, management board chairman of the German stock exchange holding company, Deutsche Boerse AG.</p>
<p>The impact of the listing goes beyond Germany. It will probably be the largest-ever listing of a foreign company in Tokyo and the offer is already affecting European telecoms companies. Shares in some European carriers have risen as they are considered undervalued in light of Telekom's probable price.</p>
<p>And analysts say that a successful Deutsche Telekom flotation could bode well for issues to come later, such as France Telecom, which goes up for sale next year.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom's privatisation, some eight years in the making, has transformed the company from a rigid state bureaucracy with little concern for its customers to a company doing all it can to quickly modernise and hone services.</p>
<p>The Bonn government will continue to hold a majority stake until the year 2000, the first opportunity it will have by law to sell its shares.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to become the most customer-friendly company on the global telecommunications market so that our customers enjoy working with us and forget about the competition,&quot; said chief executive Sommer.</p>
<p>Sommer, now 47, was a &quot;whiz kid&quot; who received a doctorate in mathematics at the age of 22. He joined Telekom last year and has already had a huge impact on the company, setting out to bring about a shift in corporate culture and prepare the company for competition.</p>
<p>Only a small part of the company's activities face competition at present -- areas such as mobile phones and provision of corporate networks. The lion's share of revenues come from services protected by Telekom's 100-year-old monopoly.</p>
<p>But that will all change with the &quot;Big Bang&quot; in 1998, when Europe opens the doors to telecoms competition. After the listing, industry observers say regulators in Brussels and Washington will step up the pressure on Germany to curtail Telekom's enormous power in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Alliances between big German companies such as engineering group Mannesmann, energy group Veba and utilities RWE and Viag have teamed up with the likes of AT&amp;T, British Telecom and Cable and Wireless to challenge the local giant.</p>
<p>These companies hope to carve out a piece of Germany's telecommunications market for themselves. Valued at around 80 billion marks now, Europe's biggest telecoms market is expected to grow to 100 billion marks a year by 2000. ($1=1.5087 Mark)</p>
