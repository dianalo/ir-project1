<p>Shanghai copper futures ended down on Thursday on profit-taking despite overnight gains on the London Metal Exchange (LME), traders said.</p>
<p>Selling by big copper producers triggered follow-up short positions and profit-taking, and saw the local red metal move against the LME, they said.</p>
<p>The most actively traded September 1997 contract ended at an intraday low of 23,800 yuan ($2,870) per tonne, losing 120 yuan. It opened at 24,010 and hit a high of 24,050 yuan per tonne.</p>
<p>June fell 200 yuan to 23,150, July 90 to 23,410, August 110 to 23,600, October 80 to 23,830 and November 70 to 23,830.  </p>
<p>Combined volume rose to 36,270 tonnes from 19,890 tonnes.</p>
<p>LME copper ended Wednesday at $2,533 a tonne, and early trade on Thursday saw the price move around this strong level, supported by a stock drawdown of 3,550 tonnes.</p>
<p>Shanghai copper opened high but profit-taking and short-selling pushed prices down with most contracts closing at or near their intraday lows.</p>
<p>&quot;Copper failed to stand firm above the 24,000-yuan level, indicating heavy selling pressure at that level,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Big copper producers were seen building short positions above the 24,000-yuan level, which hurt buyers' confidence and encouraged profit-taking and follow-up shorters,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Nor did the current physical copper price provide any support to the futures market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The price of physical copper is around 23,300 yuan per tonne in the Shanghai area.</p>
<p>Producers were not likely to change their policy of building short positions above 24,000 yuan unless they heard some strong market-moving news, some traders said.  </p>
<p>But other traders said copper would rise again after the short-term correction.</p>
<p>Aluminium ended down across the board. June fell 50 to 15,300 yuan per tonne, July 50 to 15,500 and August 140 to 15,560 yuan per tonne.</p>
<p>Combined volume rose to 590 tonnes from 230 tonnes.</p>
<p>($1=8.2936 yuan)</p>
