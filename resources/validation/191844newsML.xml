<headline>S&amp;P assigns ratings to six Lazard bond funds.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-15</dateline>

<p>Standard and Poor's said on Friday it had assigned AAAf ratings to Lazard High Yield Bond Fund, Lazard US Dollar Bond Fund, Lazard Diversified Bond Fund and Lazard International Bond Fund.</p>
<p>It also said it assigned AA+f ratings to Lazard Sterling Reserve Fund and Lazard US Dollar Reserve Fund.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P said in a statement the six rated funds all invested in high quality, mainly liquid issues, primarily highly rated government and corporate debt. A number of funds were multicurrency, and hedging decisions wer based on the manager's views of currency direction.</p>
<p>Credit Quality Ratings, identified by the f' subscript, are assigned to funds or pools which exhibit variable net asset values. The f' subscripted rating is a current assessment of overall credit quality of the portfolio.</p>
<p>The rating reflects the level of protection against losses from credit defaults and is based mainly on analysis of the management of the fund and the credit quality of the funds' investments, eligible investments, and likelihood of counterparty default (including foreign exchange and derivative transactions and cash deposits).</p>
<p>The ratings do not address potential volatility of a fund's share price due to interest rate or currency risk.</p>
<p>The Lazard Brothers Global Bond Fund is an umbrella investment company with variable capital incorporated with limited liability in Ireland. The company qualifies and is authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland as a Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) for the purposes of UCITS regulations.</p>
