<p>The tiring Springboks badly need a rest but will be forced to cope with miserable weather and Frenchmen seeking revenge for the next two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;France is the most difficult of all tours and not only because of the cold,&quot; claimed winger James Small, looking ahead to five matches, including two tests, in 15 days. &quot;It's like being on another planet.&quot;</p>
<p>The world champions play the French Barbarians on Saturday in Brive and will then meet France twice, on November 30 in Bordeaux and on December 7 at Parc des Princes.</p>
<p>The visitors, who will also encounter a French selection in Lyon on November 26 and the French students in Lille on December 3, know their hosts will be eager to erase painful memories.</p>
<p>The last time the two teams clashed, in June 1995 in Durban, the South Africans narrowly won 19-15 after a tense encounter on a flooded pitch to earn a place in the World Cup final.</p>
<p>The Springboks went on to win the tournament before their elated fans while the French, who saw Abdelatif Benazzi narrowly miss a try in the dying moments of their semifinal, had to be content with beating England to take third place.</p>
<p>Hard times have followed for the South Africans, who experienced traumatic changes in personnel and lost a home series this year to the All Blacks for the first time.</p>
<p>Two resounding victories against the Pumas on their recent tour of Argentina have brought some consolation but they are still feeling their way under new coach Andre Markgraaf who has replaced Kitch Christie.</p>
<p>Now captained by Natal number eight Gary Teichman, they still rely heavily on some of their World Cup heroes such as scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen and elegant fullback Andre Joubert.</p>
<p>But they are now anxious to add a touch a modernity to the traditional values of South African rugby, despite an exhausting sseason.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a very long season with the Super 12, the Tri-Series and the Currie Cup,&quot; said Small. &quot;But we are well-paid professionals and we've got to cope with that.&quot;</p>
<p>France, who gathered at a training camp in Narbonne on Wednesday, have worries of their own as three of their best players, captain Philippe St Andre, gifted winger Emile Ntamack and powerful lock Olivier Merle, will all miss the first test through injury.</p>
<p>Even if France now clearly understand the importance of a strong pack, they still rely mainly on their flair and their ability to run the ball.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't believe there is a gap between the two hemispheres and if there is, it's not as wide as some people say,&quot; said French team boss Jean-Claude Skrela. &quot;But it's true that playing the Springboks will provide us with an opportunity of finding out where we stand.&quot;</p>
<p>The South Africans will want to show their victory in Durban was no accident and that they remain a formidable side.</p>
<p>&quot;What happened to us after the World Cup was caused mostly by a string of injuries,&quot; said Small. &quot;It will be tough because the French will be looking for revenge but I believe we are just as strong as when we won the World Cup.&quot;</p>
