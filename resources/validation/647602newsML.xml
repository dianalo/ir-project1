<p>Wall Street stocks are expected to open mixed to slightly lower Monday, based on lower futures numbers and a lack of major news from over the weekend, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;My guess is we are going to get a down opening.  The futures prices would suggest it and there was no news over the weekend to move it higher or lower,&quot; said Thom Brown managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures were off 1.20 at 861.30. The 30-year bond was down 5/32 at a 6.79 percent yield.  </p>
<p>Analysts said they expected to see some profit taking after Friday's rise to a new record high.  The Dow industrials rallied 130 points Friday, breaking through to 7436.</p>
<p>&quot;You might see some profit taking after Friday's moon shot, but after that it is anyone's guess,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, an analyst at Prudential Securities.</p>
<p>Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments, said he expected the early profit taking to yield to even more record highs.  </p>
<p>&quot;My guess is the psychological barrier of 7500 is going to be tested today,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the green light is on for a short-term pop up.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts added that Microsoft Corp's announcement that it would invest about $1 billion in cable television operator Comcast Corp may boost cable stocks.  </p>
<p>Japan's Nikkei-225 index finished off 2.40 points, or 0.01 percent, lower at 20,485.75.  In London, the FTSE 100 was up 13.9 points at 4658.9.  U.S. stocks were firm there as a weaker U.S. dollar attracted European investors.</p>
<p>The dollar was battered against the yen due to concerns about Japan's trade surplus, trading at 112.33/38 yen.  In Europe, it was at 1.7112/22 marks.  </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal said in its Heard on the Street column that leveraged-buyout funds have hit some snags recently in the competitive LBO market. With about $35 billion estimated for LBO funds this year, the players are facing high multiples and are saddled with some difficult companies.</p>
<p>The New York Times said in its Market Place column that mutual fund investors are less enthusiastic about technology stocks.  For the week ended last Wednesday, investors took $62.5 million out of technology funds, making it the worst week since October, the paper said.</p>
