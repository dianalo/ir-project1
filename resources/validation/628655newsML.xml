<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>An opposition candidate for the mayor's job of Mexico City, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, has consolidated his lead before the July 6 election, a poll released on Friday showed.</p>
<p>The poll by the Mexican Institute for Public Opinion (IMOP) showed Cardenas, candidate for the left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), would have received 37 percent of the vote, compared to 26 percent for the candidate of the right-wing National Action Party (PAN), Carlos Castillo.</p>
<p>The candidate for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Alfredo del Mazo, would have taken 19 percent of the vote, while 18 percent would have gone to smaller parties, the poll said.</p>
<p>This will be the first time voters will be able to pick a leader for Mexico City. Up to now, the president of the republic had decided who should run one of the world's largest cities.</p>
<p>In percentage terms, the PRD lead rose 16 percent since a similar poll was taken in late April. The PRI support has fallen 10 percent since then.</p>
<p>&quot;The victory of Cardenas is probably irreversible,&quot; the poll's author's said. Cardenas was the unsuccessful PRD candidate for president of Mexico in the last two elections.</p>
<p>The poll also showed that 55 percent of people believed the PRI would lose its majority in the lower house of Congress, where voters will chose new representatives in July.</p>
<p>The poll was taken between May 26 and 29 among 600 people. No margin of error was given.</p>
