<headline>UK's Dorrell joins Clarke's leadership campaign.</headline>

<p>Former health secretary Stephen Dorrell on Wednesday abandoned his flagging campaign for the leadership of the Conservative party, turfed out of office by Labour last month, and gave his backing to Kenneth Clarke.</p>
<p>Clarke, the former finance minister who fought a rearguard battle against right-wingers trying to hijack European policy before the British election on May 1, welcomed Dorrell's endorsement.</p>
<p>Clarke, now favourite to take over from former prime minister John Major, said that if he won the leadership race he would reward his former rival.</p>
<p>&quot;As leader I shall ensure that the Conservative party quickly reasserts its dominance of the policy agenda... Stephen Dorrell will have a central role in that process,&quot; Clarke told a news conference called to announce Dorrell's endorsement.</p>
<p>Dorrell's endorsement makes it even more likely that Clarke will come top of the first ballot for the party leadership on June 10. Both men are on the centre-left of the party.</p>
<p>The winner in the first ballot needs an overall majority of the 164 Conservative members of parliament -- the only people entitled to vote for the party leader -- plus a lead of 15 percent over his nearest rival.</p>
<p>This could open the way for Clarke's main rivals, former Welsh Secretary William Hague and former social security secretary Peter Lilley. Two other right-wingers, former cabinet minister John Redwood and former home secretary Michael Howard, are trailing.</p>
<p>In the second round on June 17, the winner needs a straight majority. But if no one succeeds -- and an outright winner is still unlikely -- the top two candidates go through to a straight fight on June 19.</p>
<p>Major, ousted as prime minister by Labour's landslide election victory, has refused to endorse any of the candidates, saying it is not up to him to influence MPs in their choice.</p>
