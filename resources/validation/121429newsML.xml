<p>Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti on Wednesday predicted a crisis if Israel failed to redeploy in the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>Kabariti was speaking to reporters in Cairo after talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on an Arab strategy towards the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on the redeployment, widely seen as a test of the Israeli government's peace intentions.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat went in to see Mubarak shortly afterwards to brief him on the latest developments in the negotiations, which have made little apparent progress despite weeks of vigorous U.S. mediation. He later saw Kabariti.</p>
<p>&quot;The way it looks right now is that there are differences and we hope that with the mediation of the Americans that these differences can be worked out,&quot; Kabariti said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am hopeful but without the redeployment in Hebron I think that we will be having a crisis in hand,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Direct formal talks between Israel and the Palestinians are expected to resume later on Wednesday in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, close to the Israeli border.</p>
<p>Israel, arguing that the 400 Jewish settlers in the town need more protection, is trying to renegotiate the Hebron agreement it signed with the Palestinians more than a year ago.</p>
<p>The Palestinians, backed by Israel's Arab neighbours, are opposed to any substantial changes which would dilute the powers of the Palestinian Authority in the town.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials said on Tuesday that King Hussein of Jordan was trying to arrange a meeting between himself, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>But Kabariti said he knew nothing of this. &quot;I have no idea whatsoever that we were trying to persuade President Arafat to meet with Bibi Netanyahu or that we are playing a mediating role at this moment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The prime minister said Netanyahu had again told King Hussein on the telephone that Israel was committed to the 1993 agreement which laid the foundations for Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;He reiterated his commitment (to) the Oslo agreement and said he will continue working towards reaching a solution to implement it in any way that will ensure security for both the Palestinians and the Jewish population living in the Palestinian areas,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe there is still a chance and I hope that it won't take long for the Israeli prime minister to be convinced of the need to implement these agreements,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the Palestinian side is showing all flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement. But all of us, in Egypt, Jordan and Palestine, agree that any agreement should not depart from the text that was signed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators worked late into Tuesday night to break the impasse over Hebron and the two sides offered sharply different views on whether they were making headway.</p>
<p>Arafat said talks had been fruitless, but Israeli officials said good progress had been made and dismissed Arafat's pessimism as a negotiating tactic.</p>
<p>&quot;Until now, there is no progress in any of the committees in the negotiations,&quot; Arafat told reporters in autonomous Jericho on Tuesday at a joint news conference with King Hussein.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told reporters in Jerusalem he hoped outstanding issues on Hebron could be resolved this week. &quot;We are advancing,&quot; Levy said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been very good progress in the talks,&quot; Netanyahu's media adviser David Bar-Illan told CNN television.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials in Washington made clear they believed Israeli officials were exaggerating the progress. &quot;Despite what the Israelis are saying, there's been no breakthrough in the talks,&quot; one official said.</p>
