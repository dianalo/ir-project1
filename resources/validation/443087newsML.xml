<p>Albanian gunmen fired at military helicopters on the ground and in the air on Friday as the United States and European nations rushed to rescue hundreds of citizens stranded in the lawless country.</p>
<p>With fearful Albanians fleeing across the Adriatic on ancient navy boats and cargo ships, helicopters swept in to pick up many of the more than 1,500 foreigners pulled to safety from the capital Tirana and the nearby port of Durres.</p>
<p>German and American troops returned fire in separate incidents after being shot at by gunmen while an Italian AB-212 combat helicopter was also hit by two bullets.</p>
<p>&quot;It was hit by small arms fire which entered the cockpit without any consequences for the crew,&quot; the Italian defence ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Italy, destination of most of the refugees fleeing across the sea and many of the foreigners being evacuated, announced earlier that it had completed a major operation to bring out around 1,000 foreigners of various nationalities.</p>
<p>While it was not clear whether the Italian helicopter had been hit by random fire, a trademark of the uprising in Albania following the collapse of the country's risky pyramid savings schemes, there was no doubt about other incidents.</p>
<p>The United States said it was suspending its operations after two Marine helicopters came under fire.</p>
<p>Defence Secretary William Cohen told reporters later in Washington that the evacuation from Tirana, which had started on Thursday, was suspended &quot;for the next several hours&quot;.</p>
<p>A Pentagon spokesman said a Marine Cobra helicopter was targeted by an SA7 shoulder-launched missile while another was fired at and shot back. All the helicopters involved had returned to their ships in the Adriatic.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said that 408 Americans had been evacuated from Tirana, where the sound of wild gunfire crackled in the air and armed looters stripped shops and plundered weapons from armouries, before the flights were suspended.</p>
<p>The U.S. and German military personnel were unscathed but a diplomatic source in Tirana said one Albanian involved in the German evacuation was slightly hurt.</p>
<p>German troops, flying in on six helicopters to pick up a group of foreigners, fired on gunmen who shot at the evacuees and their aircraft in Tirana.</p>
<p>Pictures from a Turkish television crew obtained by Reuters television showed the troops diving to the ground when the gunmen opened fire from a van and then shooting back.</p>
<p>The German foreign ministry said about 100 of its citizens and other foreigners were flown to Montenegro, bordering Albania to the north, and then on to Frankfurt.</p>
<p>While some countries flew directly to Tirana because the Balkan country's roads were no longer deemed safe, others organised vehicle convoys from the capital to the coast.</p>
<p>Italy did both, picking up a group of 93 foreigners from Tirana and also evacuating some 500 people, including 120 Britons, by helicopter and boat from Durres to navy ships where they joined another 400 flown to safety on Thursday.</p>
<p>France sent four helicopters to Durres to evacuate French nationals and those of several other countries. The Foreign Ministry said about 100 people were rescued and flown to the southern Italian port of Brindisi.</p>
<p>&quot;About half were French nationals and the others were from other countries,&quot; said a spokesman in Paris.</p>
<p>The armed forces had said earlier that Romanians, ex-Yugoslavs, Italians and Albanian spouses of French nationals were among those waiting to be taken to safety.</p>
