<headline>Turners and Growers 6-mth trading profit NZ$1.2mln.</headline>

<p>Turners and Growers Ltd said on Thursday its operating profit for the six months to December 31 was NZ$1.2 million.</p>
<p>To this it added $4.1 million from realised capital profits arising on the sale of two properties in downtown Auckland, giving a total six month profit of $5.3 million, against $2 million in the previous corresponding period.</p>
<p>Turners and Growers said its profit after tax and minority interests was $4.7 million.  </p>
<p>The company, which is 42 percent owned by Guinness Peat Group, said growth in operating profits over the remaining six months should continue, but at a reduced rate.</p>
<p>&quot;More importantly, the company will be better positioned to improve performance in the years ahead,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The board will look seriously at a capital reduction once all current debt is extinguished.</p>
<p>Turners and Growers said turnover continued to improve but the retail fruit and produce price index languished around the mid points. Trading profits in the company's &quot;Fresh&quot; sector were negligible for the first three months as a result of continued  </p>
<p>oversupply and poor prices for many core lines.</p>
<p>Imported fruit sales continued to be a valued contributor to the overall result.</p>
<p>Turners and Growers was reorganising its Fresh business, aiming to centralise its accounting services at one location in Auckland.</p>
<p>The company said fine-tuning continued in its auction operations, which looked set to post a convincing year-end profit.  </p>
<p>&quot;Some of these gains will be offset in the second half by the upfront costs of implementing the new Fresh sector strategies,&quot; Turners and Growers said.</p>
