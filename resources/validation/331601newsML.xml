<headline>Indonesian minister confirms Busang deadline.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA, Indonesia</dateline>

<p>Mines and Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana said Indonesia will seek investors in the huge Busang gold find if Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd and Barrick Gold Corp. fail to meet a February deadline.</p>
<p>&quot;Surely yes,&quot; he said Thursday night when asked if the government would look for other investors if Bre-X and Barrick failed to settle with local partners within the one month given by his ministry from Jan. 17.</p>
<p>Sudjana also did not dismiss the possibility of Placer Dome Inc. of Canada being involved in the development of the find, estimated by Bre-X to contain at least 57 million ounces of gold worth over $21 billion at current prices.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a possibility,&quot; he said when asked if Placer could be involved in developing the property.</p>
<p>Placer has proposed a $5 billion merger with Bre-X and offered up to 40 percent of the property to Indonesian interests, including the government.</p>
<p>Indonesian mining officials had earlier raised concerns over Placer's environmental credentials because of its involvement in the Marcopper copper mine in the Philippines, which suffered a major tailings leak in March, 1996, polluting a local river.</p>
<p>Placer wrote off its investment in Marcopper last year and took a $43 million charge to earnings for the accident.</p>
<p>The Mines and Energy Ministry wrote to Bre-X and Barrick on Jan. 17 telling them to settle with their local partners within one month or everything discussed previously would be cancelled.</p>
<p>A ministry official told Reuters Thursday that if the companies failed to meet the deadline, the government was prepared to take control of the property.</p>
