<p>Clint Eastwood, a man who needs no introduction, has lent his name and image to a new line of clothes designed for his passionate pastime, golf.</p>
<p>He made &quot;Go ahead, make my day&quot; a world-famous phrase, but these days Eastwood would rather take a swing at golf balls and does so whenever he's not making movies.</p>
<p>Eastwood is one of three equal partners in a new company, Prime Golf USA, based in Los Angeles, and is the spiritual guide to the men's wear side of the line.</p>
<p>Golf is to the 1990s what tennis was to the '80s, said Prime Golf USA Chief Executive and designer Nancy Haley.</p>
<p>Golf is taking off, she said from Denver where she oversees the design end of the business. She credits Tiger Woods, &quot;who is so classy and represents all the young kids coming up&quot; for today's surge. But golf has been on &quot;an incredible growth spurt. It's like tennis was 15 years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>What better time to introduce lines of men's and women's golf clothes, she said. However, these clothes leave the floral prints and loud plaids that typified golf wear of years past to someone else.</p>
<p>Other new entries into the golf apparel world are Tommy Hilfiger, Reebok's Greg Norman line and Ralph Lauren's Polo, all of which are providing an updated, younger look to the sport.</p>
<p>The clothes are &quot;my vision of who Clint Eastwood is -- a classy, classic icon.&quot; She said she makes clothes &quot;that would fit him.</p>
<p>&quot;I've taken the look of the '40s and tweeked it for the '90s -- 20th century classics. You feel this when you're with Clint. Class and good living.&quot;</p>
<p>Eastwood has not had a hand in designing any of the golfwear, but Haley said his influence is on every piece.</p>
<p>The men's line, called Tehema Clint, is named after the Northern California county that takes its name from an extinct American 1ndian tribe's word for beautiful mountains and streams. It's a name, she said, that Clint loves.</p>
<p>Haley calls the 100-piece men's line &quot;sophisticated, retail looking ... but you could wear it anywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>Many of the polo shirts and sweaters with baby cable knit designs harken back to the look of Bobby Jones, a golfer in the 1920s and 1930s who is often considered the greatest golfer who ever lived.</p>
<p>&quot;Clint has such a great sense of humour,&quot; Haley said, and thus V-neck sweaters will reflect &quot;more funky styles.&quot;</p>
<p>The men's clothes will be distinguished by an embroidered &quot;T&quot; on the centre back, just below the collar.</p>
<p>There will be no trademark on the women's collection, called Tehema by Nancy Haley. There are 100 different pieces, including shorts, skorts, tops and sweaters.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to dictate where the clothes can be worn,&quot; she said of the streetwear-inspired sportswear.</p>
<p>&quot;I put blinders on and do what I see is important,&quot; said Haley, who, not coincidentally, is also a golfer.</p>
<p>Both the men's and women's lines will have four colour schemes, incorporating subtler colour combinations than traditional colours often associated with golfwear, such as pastel pink and lime green.</p>
<p>Priced in the &quot;upper moderate&quot; category, Haley said 75 percent of the clothes are manufactured in the United States and the remainder, particularly the mercerized cotton knits, are manufactured overseas.</p>
<p>The third member of the Haley-Eastwood triangle, Mark Werts, will supervise internal operations and help design the men's collection from Los Angeles. He is the co-owner of American Rag Cie., retail stores in Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>
<p>Eastwood will wear Tehema fashions when he competes in golf tournaments and will be a model for advertisements and the Tehema catalogue.</p>
<p>He is also using the name Tehema (pronounced te-HAY-ma) for a new golf course he is building in Carmel Valley, Calif., not far from his luxury vacation resort. Haley said it will be an &quot;invitation-only&quot; course.</p>
<p>There will be very few consumer ads to start, Haley said, but advertisements will appear in trade magazines in late summer, coinciding with the August MAGIC men's wear trade show and September's PGA International Golf Show, both to be held in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Tehama Clint and Tehema by Nancy Haley clothes will be available in November at golf pro shops at selected clubs and resorts and at a few speciality and department stores such as Nordstrom, Nieman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.</p>
