<p>Vietnam's ruling communist party will press ahead with open-market economic reforms and expects early membership in both APEC and the World Trade Organisation, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Kiet told a business conference in the Indian capital that Vietnam, which first embraced open-door economic policies in the late 1980s, aimed to become an industrialised state by 2020.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue to further push forward our reform, sustain the pace of growth, maintain a balance between economic growth and social and environmental requirements, encourage foreign investors and help them to explore and exploit business opportunities in Vietnam,&quot; Kiet said.</p>
<p>Vietnam is striving to link its economy more tightly to those of the region, and has become a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) which also groups Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines.</p>
<p>&quot;Vietnam is now actively preparing the groundwork for and looking forward to her early membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the World Trade Organisation,&quot; Kiet said.</p>
<p>Vietnam is the only ASEAN member outside APEC. At the APEC summit last November in the Philippines, ASEAN members pressed other APEC states to reconsider membership for Vietnam. But the call to reconsider Vietnam prompted some leaders to demand similar consideration for Peru.</p>
<p>APEC has agreed to draft a set of conditions for new membership this year, announce successful candidates in 1998 and accept them as full members in 1999.</p>
<p>Vietnam initiated the formal process for entry into the WTO in early 1995, soon after the organisation's establishment.</p>
<p>The Hanoi government says membership would open access to international markets and support its economic reforms.</p>
<p>Kiet cited &quot;upsetting&quot; problems which have emerged as Vietnam opens its economy to trade and investment. He cited acute competition which was forcing developing countries &quot;to penetrate into the developed markets which are thoroughly protected under various new and sophisticated forms&quot;.</p>
<p>He said Vietnam could not ignore poverty in some segments of society, unemployment, income disparity, environmental concerns and the need to preserve the national culture.</p>
<p>While economic liberalisation unleashed private enterprise, the state must remain the &quot;multiplier of people's creative resources and the successful organiser of reforms&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>The state must also ensure political and social stability, which are prerequisites for economic restructuring, Kiet said.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese prime minister vowed to complete the &quot;unfinished elements of the market economy&quot; and to pursue difficult administrative reform.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese leader, who arrived in India on Friday, was scheduled to meet Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma and Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda on Saturday.</p>
<p>India and Vietnam were expected to sign trade and industrial agreements before Kiet leaves on Sunday, the Press Trust of India said.</p>
