<text>
<p>This small Quebec community anointed one of its residents the first &quot;mayor-king&quot; in North America on Tuesday.</p>
<p>More than 5,000 people flocked to participate in ceremonies for the coronation of Denys the First as &quot;king&quot; on Quebec's main annual holiday in this village of 1,300 people 186 miles (300 km) north of Quebec City.</p>
<p>The event coincided with a visit to Canada by its head of state, Queen Elizabeth, who was in Newfoundland on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The spoof coronation was the brainchild of mayor Denys Tremblay, a 46-year-old artist and tourism promoter. In January, residents voted 73 percent in favour of turning the village into a mock monarchy and making him &quot;king&quot;.</p>
<p>A year after flash floods destroyed the village, the coronation was a tongue-in-cheek opportunity for local people to celebrate a symbolic rebirth.</p>
<p>Tremblay said he hoped to attract tourists to L'Anse Saint-Jean. He also wants to raise C$1 million ($720,000) to landscape a nearby hillside, using trees and shrubs to fashion the likeness of St. John the Baptist, the Roman Catholic saint honoured on Quebec's holiday.</p>
<p>His first two achievements were more modest. A local brewery created a commemorative beer named &quot;La Royale&quot;, and he secured C$18,000 ($12,900) from the Canadian government's arts council for his crown and jewels.</p>
