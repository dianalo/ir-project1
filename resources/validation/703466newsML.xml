<p>September BTP futures on LIFFE will chop around in a range on Wednesday but could find the tug from the 134.84 record high too hard to resist, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking for further choppy, range-trading action between 133.75 and 134.84 ahead of a return to a bull trend,&quot; Robin Wilkin, senior technical analyst at MCM YieldWatch in London, said. &quot;Hourly studies are still bullish and we could see a push up into that area.&quot;</p>
<p>BTPs were quoted at 134.57 at 0729 GMT, up 16 basis points from Tuesday's settlement.  </p>
<p>BTPs reached an all-time high of 134.84 on June 26.</p>
<p>Wilkin said the contract would aim for 135.16 if it managed to pierce 134.84. That level represents a 61.8 percent retracement of the last move higher from 132.55 on June 19 to the high at 134.84, projected off the 133.75 low on June 27.</p>
<p>David Wood, independent technical analyst near London, said the contract could push higher.</p>
<p>&quot;It's quite constructive in that we've held 133.75 over the last couple of days,&quot; he said. &quot;As long as we hold above 134.30/15 that will keep up the short-term momentum as we try for the highs and 135.00.&quot;  </p>
<p>Both Wood and Wilkin said the main support level was at 133.75.</p>
<p>&quot;If we lost 133.75 we could see a pull back to 132.64,&quot; Wilkin said. That level was a 38.2 percent retracement of the rally from the June 10 low of 129.07 to the high at 134.84.</p>
<p>At the short end, September Eurolire were quoted at 93.52, unchanged on the day.</p>
