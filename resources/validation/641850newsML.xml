<p>Indonesia told all government institutions to buy Timor &quot;national&quot; cars, Planning Minister Ginanjar Kartasasmita was quoted by the official Antara news agency on Thursday as saying.</p>
<p>Ginanjar said the government had directed all government institutions, state and local government companies to buy national cars made by PT Timor Putra Nasional, headed by President Suharto's youngest son Hutomo Mandala Putra.</p>
<p>&quot;We have instructed all government institutions to buy national cars this year if they need operational cars which are not used commercially,&quot; Ginanjar said.</p>
<p>Indonesia's national car policy gives Timor tax and tariff breaks to produce a national car in association with Kia Motors Corp of South Korea.</p>
<p>Ginanjar said the rule did not violate free trade principles following recent disputes with Japan and other auto makers.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has the right to buy something according to its wish. It doesn't mean that other cars cannot be bought, it can be bought but not by government officials,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Japan, the United States and the European Union have said the policy discriminates against other manufacturers and have brought their complaint to the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>Indonesia has defended its policy, saying the national car programme is aimed at strengthening its domestic industry.</p>
