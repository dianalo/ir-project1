<p>NOTES (1) BELGIUM - Exchanges (bonds close to maturity for longer dated paper) for 1997 were set at 250.0 billion Belgian francs and at 346.1 billion Belgian francs for 1996. Debt tends to be financed around 95 percent in Belgian francs and about 25 percent in maturities of less than one year (Treasury bills). (2) DENMARK - No official central bank breakdown for 1997. For 1996 short-term T-notes (with a maturity of three to nine months) showed a deficit of 4.3 billion crowns, T-notes (with a maximum maturity of three years) were at 20.4 billion crowns, state bonds (maturiting 1999-2024) were at 84.8 billion crowns. (3) FRANCE - France's gross financing need (on top line) includes net budget deficit, redemptions and other state loans. In 1997, redemptions include 185.6 billion of OATs and 167.5 billion BTANs, while other state loans total 37 billion francs. In 1996, the financing need includes 51.5 billion of OATs and 201.9 billion of BTANs, while other state loans amount to 16.6 billion. Latest figure for 1996 budget deficit is from February 12 announcement. All other figures as of December 31, 1996. (4) GERMANY - UBS Global Research estimates gross funding requirement in 1997 will be 230 billion marks, made up of 167 billion marks of debt maturing and an estimated 62.5 billion marks net borrowing requirement -- above the government's own estimate of 53.3 billion marks.</p>
<p>The federal government issues about 10 billion marks of six-month T-bills, or Bubills, each quarter. It also issues eight to 10 billion marks of two-year T-notes each quarter. Such regular issues of short-term paper were started in 1996. The governement also issues eight to 10 billion marks of five-year Bundesobligationen bonds each quarter. (5) FINLAND - The 1997 gross funding figure includes a roll-over of T-bills. The net borrowing figure for 1997 does not include short-term funding. The 91 billion markka of redemptions includes 30 billion in foreign currencies. (6) IRELAND - The redemption total does not include any foreign currency redemptions. Stock being redeemed includes 95 million on April 1, 244 million on July 15, 956 million on July 27 and 90 million on November 15. (7) ITALY - Redemptions exclude BOT T-bills. Of the 1997 redemptions, 10.055 billion are in foreign currencies (4,262 billion of CTEs --Treasury Certificates in Ecu-- and 5,793 billion in foreign currency-denominated Italy loans). (8) NETHERLANDS - 1997 net funding figure excludes early redemptions. Finance ministry has said call on captial market this year will be reduced by 14.35 billion guilders. This cuts gross funding to 19.15 billion and net to 6.65 billion.</p>
<p>For 1997, the finance ministry has already issued a new 5.75 percent February 2007 bond for 7.5 billion guilders as the new 10-year benchmark. It said it would also reopen the January 2023 and January 2001 bonds (of 3.0 billion guilders each). (9) NORWAY - For 1996 there was an estimated budget surplus. During 1996 there were five bond auctions and 12 T-bill auctions. Estimated budget surplus which went to state Oil Fund 45.8 billion crowns.</p>
<p>For 1997 a government budget surplus is forecast at 55.4 billion crowns, which will go to the state's Oil Fund for investment. Finance ministry says state needs will be met by domestic borrowing and by drawing on cash reserves.</p>
<p>(10) SPAIN - The 1997 gross figure includes the six-month bills for 330 billion pesetas sold during January and maturing in July, but it does not include the six-month bills which will be issued in the first semester.</p>
<p>(11) SWEDEN - Swedish National Debt Office does not publish a gross figure for government funding. The net figure includes estimated one-off revenues from privatisation/selling of state-owned companies/assets. No net borrowing is planned in foreign currencies. Gross borrowing in foreign currency is estimated at 52.0 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Prior to 1997, the fiscal year ran from July 1 to June 30. Therefore the fiscal year 1995/96 was 18 months, running from July 1, 1995 to December 31, 1996. The NDO does not publish figures for the fiscal year 1995/96, only for the calendar year.</p>
<p>(12) SWITZERLAND - 1997 figures include borrowing for the state railways and PTT. The Swiss government has 34 federal bonds outstanding, with the next maturing in February and the longest dated 2014. The maturities are concentrated around the 10-year area. Total bonds outstanding total around 35 billion francs.</p>
<p>(13) BRITAIN - The UK operates on a fiscal year running from April 1 to March 31. Figures in the table for 1997 issuance are actually for the year ending March 31, 1998.</p>
