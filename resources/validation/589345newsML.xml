<headline>NBA BASKETBALL-SONICS HOLD OFF ROCKETS, FORCE DECIDING SEVENTH GAME.</headline>
<dateline>SEATTLE 1997-05-15</dateline>

<p>Shawn Kemp scored 22 points and Gary Payton 19, including a key left-handed scoop shot down the stretch, as the Seattle SuperSonics held off the Houston Rockets 99-96 Thursday and forced a decisive seventh game in their Western Conference semifinal series.</p>
<p>Payton also had 13 assists, eight rebounds and five steals, Hersey Hawkins scored 16 points and Kemp added 11 rebounds for Seattle, which has won two straight games, setting up Game 7 Saturday at Houston.</p>
<p>The SuperSonics are trying to become just the sixth team in playoff history to win a series after trailing 3-1.</p>
<p>Kemp scored 10 points and Hawkins added nine on 4-of-4 shooting as Seattle raced to a 30-13 lead in the first quarter and appeared still to have the game well in hand heading into the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>But the Rockets nearly erased a 22-point deficit, closing to 95-93 on a 3-pointer by Clyde Drexler with 31 seconds left before Payton reversed direction in the key to sneak past Charles Barkley and bank a left-handed layup that sealed the game with 12 seconds remaining.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just natural,&quot; Payton said. &quot;I like to go to my left and I can put it up with my left.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He made a hell of a play,&quot; Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. &quot;A left-handed scoop shot from the hip. He's a hell of a player, maybe the best point guard in the league.&quot;</p>
<p>Hakeem Olajuwon had 30 points and 11 rebounds and Barkley added 20 and 12 for the Rockets, who again struggled from 3-point range -- 6-of-23. Houston is just 11-of-50 in the last two games.</p>
<p>&quot;We can shoot the ball a lot better,&quot; said Drexler, who shot 3-of-14 from the field. &quot;We just need to make up our minds and shoot it with confidence. We will do that in Game 7.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to win Saturday,&quot; Barkley said. &quot;We're going to win Saturday. That's all I got to say.&quot;</p>
<p>The Rockets have never beaten the Sonics in five playoff series. Saturday's winner faces the Utah Jazz in the conference finals.</p>
<p>The Sonics built just enough of a lead early in the game to hang on at the end.</p>
<p>&quot;We just came out with a lot of energy,&quot; Payton said. &quot;If we could play like that all the time, I think it's the best we could play. I'm supposed to come out like that. When they see me D-ing the ball up, working hard, my teammates get energised.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The first quarter, they were running by us and you can't let a good team do that,&quot; said Rockets forward Mario Elie, who scored 18 points.</p>
<p>&quot;I was extremely surprised and disappointed at our lack of aggression at the beginning of the game,&quot; Tomjanovich said. &quot;We missed some point-blank shots. Their momentum was like a boulder coming down the side of a mountain and we were trying to hold it back.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sonics led 51-37 at halftime after forcing 13 turnovers. But the Rockets finally put together a surge and closed to 66-57 on a jumper by Elie with 3:42 left in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Seattle immediately responded with 11 straight points.</p>
<p>The Sonics led 78-61 entering the fourth quarter and still held a 92-82 bulge after a Payton basket with just over four minutes to go. But Olajuwon made three straight jumpers, cutting the deficit to four points with 2:32 to play.</p>
<p>Schrempf made two foul shots and Kemp added one before Barkley scored inside with 1:28 remaining, pulling Houston within 95-90 as the Rockets' press bothered Seattle. Barkley and Kemp each missed before Drexler's 3-pointer set up Payton's clinching shot.</p>
<p>&quot;Those were the slowest moments for a long time,&quot; Sonics coach George Karl said. &quot;I couldn't believe we could get that tired and that tentative. We had the lead, then they trapped us and that got them back close to single digits, and then we just got tentative.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was a dogfight to the end,&quot; said Kemp.</p>
<p>The Sonics ended the road teams' four-game winning streak in the series.</p>
