<p>Fractious Northern Irish peace talks came under new pressure on Tuesday when pro-British Loyalist parties warned they might soon founder on demands for guerrilla disarmament.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless there is substantial movement on the (arms) decommissioning issue, in all likelihood the multi-party negotiations...will collapse within days,&quot; said David Adams, a leader of the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP).</p>
<p>The warning came on the eve of important London talks between British Prime Minister John Major and representatives of the political wings of outlawed Loyalist gunmen operating a two-year-old truce in a battle with anti-British IRA guerrillas.</p>
<p>Amid tightened security against possible Irish Republican Army bombings, British and Irish ministers will hold a late night Wednesday meeting in Belfast to assess prospects of a new IRA guerrilla truce to win a voice in peace talks.</p>
<p>Police in Londonderry city thwarted preparations for a suspected IRA landmine ambush last weekend.</p>
<p>The incident threw a cloud over hopes of an early truce, Britain's bottom-line condition for Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, to get a seat in talks.</p>
<p>According to Loyalist sources, the disarmament issue that has long blighted political progress still blocks progress at multi-party talks chaired by former U.S.senator George Mitchell.</p>
<p>They say some mainstream Unionist parties, that are backed by members of the pro-British Protestant majority, are demanding surrender of Protestant weaponry for the PUP and UDP to remain in the talks process.</p>
<p>Adams said in a statement that the decommissioning issue &quot;is being deliberately manipulated by some participants merely to create a circumstances whereby loyalist parties will be excluded from playing any further part in negotiations&quot;.</p>
<p>The row is an escalation of a dispute that Sinn Fein maintains is being used by their Unionist political foes to keep them out of talks.</p>
<p>Both the IRA and Loyalist guerrillas have set their faces against unilaterly surrendering weapons in advance of a new political accord ending sectarian and political divisions.</p>
<p>The powerful Ulster Unionists Party (UUP) says that if the IRA calls a truce, a first tranche of republican guerrilla weapons should be given in before Sinn Fein gets to the table.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein is already barred from the Mitchell talks because the IRA ditched a 17-month truce in February and resumed a bombing wave aimed at ending British rule over Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Britain and Ireland say the IRA must declare a credible truce for Sinn Fein to get into the talks. Disarmament should occur parallel with negotiations, they say.</p>
