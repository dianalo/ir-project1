<title>FRANCE: Eramet board postpones decision, chairman stays on.</title>
<headline>Eramet board postpones decision, chairman stays on.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-10-08</dateline>

<p>French nickel producer Eramet said on Tuesday its board will conduct an in-depth study of a proposal by state-controlled ERAP to change the legal status of the company.</p>
<p>&quot;The board reviewed a proposal put forward by ERAP to turn Eramet into a company with a supervisory and a management board,&quot; Eramet said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The board expressed its interest in the project and decided to conduct an in-depth study on the issue,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Asked if this meant Eramet's management team would stay on, a company spokesman told Reuters &quot;Yes indeed&quot;.  </p>
<p>The spokesman could not say how long the review might take, suggesting it could be weeks or months before a decision was taken.</p>
<p>The board confirmed Eramet was ready &quot;if needed&quot; to lend support to plans for a (nickel) project in the north of New Caledonia, the statement said.</p>
<p>But the support must be &quot;compatible&quot; with Eramet's long-term interest and development plans in the French territory.</p>
<p>The French government said earlier on Tuesday that it had no intention of stripping Eramet's mining assets in New Caledonia.</p>
<p>Shares in Eramet hit a year low of 247 francs on Tuesday before rebounding after the government's statement. Eramet was up 14 francs at 280 at 1339 GMT.</p>
<p>Its shares had taken a beating on investors' concerns that the French state may force it to sell part of its mining assets in New Caledonia for political reasons.</p>
<p>The French government is said to be supporting a rival project in the north of the country spearheaded by local interests and Canadian group Falconbridge.</p>
<p>Investors also feared a change in the group's legal status might herald the ouster of chairman Yves Rambaud, who opposes plans to curb Eramet's expansion strategy in New Caledonia.</p>
