<p>Indonesia is expected to announce a moderate expansion in its 1997/98 budget to sustain an annual economic growth of just over seven percent, economists said.</p>
<p>President Suharto will deliver Indonesia's budget covering the year from April 1997 to March 1998 to parliament on Monday, starting around 0300 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe 15-16 percent budget growth is a fair number in the face of a 7-7.5 percent GDP growth target,&quot; Edmund Tang, economist at Chase Securities in Hong Kong, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Government sources said the 1997/98 budget was likely to grow by around 16 percent and it would be based on an average oil price of $16.50 a barrel, unchanged from the current budget.</p>
<p>Indonesia, Asia's sole member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), relied on oil and gas exports for about 16 percent of its 1996/97 budget revenues, down from over 50 percent 10 years ago.</p>
<p>The budget, which by law must be balanced, totalled 90.6 trillion rupiah ($38.4 billion) in 1996/97, a rise of 16.1 percent from 78 trillion rupiah ($33 billion) in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Mari Pangestu, head of economics at Indonesia's Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the government's new budget would not differ much from the last, and would remain conservative to stabilise the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The main government concerns remain the fast-growing economy, overheating and inflation,&quot; Pangestu told Reuters.</p>
<p>Planning Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita last week forecast economic growth in 1997 at between 7.6 and 7.9 percent. Inflation was seen at around six percent, compared with an estimate of 6.7 percent for 1996.</p>
<p>Suharto, a former army general in power since the mid-1960s, said in his year-end message the economy grew by around 7.8 percent in 1996, compared with 8.2 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>Pangestu said the current account deficit remained a key issue, but it was hovering in a still controllable zone.</p>
<p>&quot;Indonesia's current account deficit is indeed high and is showing signs of increasing. But as long as we can expect capital inflows, it's still okay and is controllable.&quot;</p>
<p>Pangestu said Indonesia was doing better than Thailand, whose current account deficit totalled 8.2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996 based on economic growth of 6.7 percent the same year.</p>
<p>She said Indonesia's economic growth was double its current account deficit of four percent of GDP.</p>
<p>But economists said the country's current account deficit would remain an issue because overall investment by Indonesians was higher than their saving capacity.</p>
<p>&quot;Our deficit was not due to poor export ability but because of investments being higher than our savings,&quot; Kwik Kian Gie, an independent economist wrote in the Kompas daily recently.</p>
<p>However, the government continues to rely on boosting its non-oil exports.</p>
<p>Indonesia introduced a major economic reform package last June which cut import tariffs on 1,497 items, simplifying trade procedures and offering incentives for export-oriented firms.</p>
<p>The central bank also moved to help stimulate the country's exports on Friday by cutting the bill of exchange discount rates for exporters by between one and 1.5 percent.</p>
