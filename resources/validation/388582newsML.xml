<headline>Protests as India pig heart transplant doctors freed.</headline>
<dateline>GUWAHATI, India 1997-02-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Three doctors charged with homicide for transplanting a pig's heart into a man who later died were released from prison on Wednesday and promptly faced protests from local residents.</p>
<p>Witnesses said a crowd of over 100 people gathered outside a jail in the northeastern state of Assam, shouting &quot;killers,&quot; &quot;butchers&quot; and &quot;murderers&quot; at the three doctors as they stepped out of the prison.</p>
<p>There was no violence, the witnesses said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-based surgeon Jonathan Ho and two Indian doctors were arrested in Assam on January 8, a day after a 30-year-old heart patient was declared dead.</p>
<p>The doctors had transplanted the pig's heart into Purna Saikia on December 15 in a private clinic 30 km (20 miles) west of the state capital Guwahati.</p>
<p>The transplant attracted international attention and widespread criticism on ethical grounds.</p>
<p>After Saikia died the three surgeons were charged with homicide and violation of a three-year-old law governing organ transplants. The maximum punishment under the law is five years in prison or a 10,000 rupee ($280) fine, officials said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday a two-judge bench of the Guwahati High Court ordered the three doctors released on bail, but impounded their passports and told them to report to police twice a week.</p>
<p>The judges also barred the doctors from performing any organ transplants without federal authorisation. No trial date has been set.</p>
