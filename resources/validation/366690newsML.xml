<p>Thousands of anti-government demonstrators rampaged through the Albanian port of Vlore on Monday, hurling stones and furniture at riot police and pinning them down in the main police station.</p>
<p>There was no official word on casualties. In mid-morning a nurse said Vlore hospital was overwhelmed, with at least 50 people, protesters and police, receiving treatment. Most had been hit by stones.</p>
<p>Protesters chased police out of the central square where they had gathered peacefully for five days to denounce President Sali Berisha and demand the return of savings lost in collapsed pyramid investment schemes.</p>
<p>They then dragged wrecked cars and oil drums through the streets to the police station, erected barricades and set them alight. Groups of young men raced periodically to the front door of the building, thew stones and retreated.</p>
<p>&quot;Police can only work here at night,&quot; shouted one protester. &quot;During the day it's ours. Berisha is finished.&quot;</p>
<p>The station was the theatre for initial clashes on Sunday night, when protesters threw stones at the building and police fired into the air. One demonstrator died, officials said of a heart attack but demonstrators blamed the police.</p>
<p>At least 23 people were hurt in Sunday's clashes.</p>
<p>In Tirana, 140 km (80 miles) to the north, senior members of Berisha's ruling Democratic Party met in parliament. The president's whereabouts was unknown.</p>
<p>Leaders of the opposition Forum for Democracy alliance also met and renewed demands for the dismissal of Berisha's administration and formation of a &quot;technocrat government'.</p>
<p>A government statement deplored the violence. The protests, it said, were &quot;a conspiracy of extreme leftist groups in Vlore&quot;.</p>
<p>The protesters accuse Berisha and his government of failing to warn investors of the pitfalls of the pyramid schemes, which have attracted the savings of virtually every family in post-communist Albania.</p>
<p>A convoy of seven large army trucks, each carrying several dozen soldiers, was seen moving down Albania's main north-south highway towards the port.</p>
<p>By Vlore police station, shots periodically rang out as the morning wore on. At least two cars raced past, coloured flags flying from windows, to evacuate wounded protesters.</p>
<p>Officers perched on nearby rooftops dropped chunks of concrete on the protest but never seemed to hit their targets.</p>
<p>Protesters had earlier routed riot police in Independence Square, forcing them to retreat to hills overlooking the city. Elderly men and women picked up paving stones and handed them to demonstrators.</p>
<p>Some officers, their uniforms torn off them, were left cowering in the street in their underpants for a time while others were taken into private homes. Captured uniforms were heaved on to two big bonfires, while protesters immediately donned helmets and riot shields.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want a war, just our money,&quot; shouted one elderly woman. &quot;The police are fascists!&quot; shrieked another.</p>
<p>Doctors had trouble coping with the flow of casualties.</p>
<p>&quot;I have counted myself more than 50 injured from both sides. People have been hit by stones,&quot; she said. &quot;More are coming all the time. It's a terrible situation. Doctors have no time even to talk.&quot;</p>
<p>Protests against the collapse of the schemes first erupted last month in Albania, Europe's poorest country. But a rash of arrests and the threat of long jail sentences had kept protesters off streets for a time.</p>
<p>The resumption of demonstrations last week in Vlore was sparked by the folding of one investment plan hugely popular in the volatile south of the country.</p>
<p>Riot police have prevented opposition protests in Tirana for the past two weekends, prompting the Forum to change tactics and urge residents to shut down shops, offices and schools for two hours every day.</p>
