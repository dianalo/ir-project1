<text>
<p>July 23 - U.S. stock index futures eroded again late, ended pit trading mixed. Sept S&amp;P 500s returned toward session low on long profittaking, including sales from a bank affililate, after morning runup to new all-time high at 949.25. Some said soft close could encourage more long profittaking Thursday.</p>

<p>&quot;We just were kind of floundering around,&quot; said one floor broker after the close, which he called &quot;mildly bearish.&quot;</p>
<p>He said S&amp;Ps could be shaping up for a repeat of last week's price action, in which the lead-month futures hit a peak on Wednesday and headed down for the balance of the week.</p>
<p>&quot;You might start to see some more (long) profit-taking tomorrow...unless something exciting happens in Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>Early in Wednesday's session, the contract had popped higher on followthrough buying from Tuesday's rally, strength in T-bond futures, some good corporate earnings plus a round of arbitrage buy programs taking advantage of a wide premium.  </p>
<p>Futures showed little response to the second day of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. His text on Tuesday eased fears of an imminent rate rise, helping U.S. asset markets snap sharply upward.</p>
<p>Fed Vice Chairman Alice Rivlin said Wednesday there seems to be little risk of the economy sliding into recession and that the risk of inflation seems higher.</p>
<p>She said Fed policymakers, in deciding whether to raise rates again after March's hike, also have to weigh the risk of slowing the economy unnecessarily against the risk of waiting too long and raising the threat of the economy overheating.  </p>
<p>Futures also again closely tracked swings in high-technology stocks, which rose early, then eroded.</p>
<p>Arb buy programs were activated near the outset, and then some apparently were unwound during the subsequent pullback to the day's low, when futures also hit sell stops, brokers added.</p>
<p>Blended fair value Wednesday was roughly 5.25 points over cash. Arb buy programs needed 6.05 points premium, and sell programs required about a 4.45-point spread over cash.</p>
<p>Sept S&amp;P 500s fell 1.00 pt to 941.25, Value Lines lost 1.10 to 826.00, Nikkei off 50.0 at 20,295.0, Midcap up 2.50 at 309.30, Russell up 1.25 at 411.60, NASDAQ off 3.00 at 1098.50. ((DerivativesDesk(312)408-8750)) E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com</p>
