<p>The bodies of Burundi's Catholic Archbishop Joachim Ruhuna and a nun have been found by soldiers in shallow graves, eight days after they were killed in an ambush by Hutu rebels, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Jean-Luc Ndizeye, spokesman for Tutsi military ruler Pierre Buyoya, said soldiers helped by local civilians found the bodies on Tuesday a few kilometres from the site of the September 9 attack in Gitongo district in central Burundi.</p>
<p>&quot;Church officials recognised the bodies of the archbishop and the nun,&quot; he said. The two are to be buried on Thursday in the city of Gitega where Ruhuna, a 62-year-old Tutsi, was archbishop.</p>
<p>Ndizeye told Reuters soldiers exchanged fire with rebels in the area before they found the bodies.</p>
<p>Ruhuna was seen by witnesses burning in his vehicle after the ambush but his body was later removed. Four people with him survived the attack, which the army and military government blamed on rebels of the Hutu majority.</p>
<p>Rebels said the Tutsi-dominated military was responsible.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 people -- most of them civilians -- have been killed in three years of massacres and a vicious civil war between the Tutsi-led army and rebels of the Hutu majority.</p>
<p>Hutu rebel leader Leonard Nyangoma on Wednesday accused the army of massacring 10,000 civilians since it seized power on July 25. He said that Burundi's neighbours should not be fooled by the lifting of a ban on parliament and political parties.</p>
<p>Nyangoma, a former interior minister who heads the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), said most parliamentarians were already in exile and the national assembly could not function without a return to constitutional rule.</p>
<p>&quot;CNDD demands all countries of the Great Lakes sub-region maintain their embargo against the putchist regime,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In Bujumbura, Burundi's foreign minister until the coup said stalemate would continue until the military-appointed government started talks with all political groups.</p>
<p>Venerand Bakevyumusaya said he returned home at the weekend from his refuge in the German embassy after Tutsi military ruler Pierre Buyoya lifted bans on parliament and political parties.</p>
<p>&quot;We should first do what we can to stop the massacres... then we intend that Buyoya should give power back,&quot; he told Reuters, adding that regional power was not enough.</p>
<p>Tanzania and Kenya said they had refused to ease sanctions against Burundi in return for Buyoya's concessions.</p>
<p>They said Buyoya failed to act on the most important demand by regional leaders: to agree to unconditional negotiations with all parties to the conflict both inside and outside Burundi.</p>
