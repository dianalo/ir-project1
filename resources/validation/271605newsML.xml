<p>The launch of Regent Pacific Group's $50 million Undervalued Assets Africa Fund, originally fixed for December 17, has been postponed until next month, the Botswana stock exchange (BSE) said.</p>
<p>&quot;The launch will be reviewed mid-January, when it is anticipated the fund will go forward,&quot; a statement said. &quot;The problem was getting decision-makers together ahead of the Christmas holiday.&quot;</p>
<p>The same problems had been experienced in Dublin and Nairobi where the fund was also to be listed, it added.</p>
<p>According to the prospectus, subscriptions totalling $20 million would have to be received for the fund to go ahead.</p>
<p>The fund would be Botswana's first pula hedge stock and was expected to be welcomed by domestic investors.</p>
<p>BSE stocks depreciated 25 percent over the past year against most hard currencies as the pula has followed the slide of the South African rand.</p>
<p>The fund, registered in the Cayman Islands, will be primary-listed in Dublin and dual listed on the Botswana and Nairobi exchanges.</p>
<p>The fund, 35.4 percent weighted towards investments in mining, would seek to obtain capital growth by investing in opportunities perceived to be undervalued, fund manager Joe Demby told a presentation in Gaborone on October 28.</p>
<p>In terms of the target asset portfolio, 2.5 percent of the fund would be invested in Botswana and 10.2 percent in Kenya.</p>
