<p>Long-term U.S. interest rates will continue to fall in coming months as the economy slows to a crawl, analysts said Wednesday.</p>
<p>By cutting the demand for capital, an expected economic slowdown could shave the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to 6.0 percent next year, a level not seen since last winter and only slightly higher than the record low of 5.77 percent from October 1993.</p>
<p>That would give consumers a big lift by lowering loan rates on major purchases like homes and cars.</p>
<p>The yield on the bellwether bond dropped to 6.64 percent early Wednesday, its lowest level in nearly seven months, before rebounding slightly in late trade.</p>
<p>The bond's price, which moves in the opposite direction, soared nearly two full points Tuesday, its biggest one-day gain in 16 months.</p>
<p>&quot;We are probably headed below 6.50 percent by the end of this year, and we could go as low as 6.0 percent by the end of 1997,&quot; said Michelle Colley Laughlin, Treasury market strategist at Prudential Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Analysts see slower economic growth ahead, which would allow interest rates to fall and bond prices to rise.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department Wednesday reported inflation-adjusted U.S. gross domestic product growth slipped to 2.2 percent in the third quarter after a 4.7 percent reading in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Prudential expects GDP growth to slow to a meagre 1.0 percent by the second half of 1997, lowering rates further.</p>
<p>&quot;It will mostly be very positive news (for the Treasury market) about the economy&quot; that drives rates lower, Laughlin added.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve could also nudge long-term rates lower by cutting the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, for the first time since Jan. 31.</p>
<p>Prudential sees the central bank lowering the funds rate from its current target at 5.25 percent sometime in 1997, Laughlin said.</p>
<p>Current monetary policy is too tight, especially with the White House and congressional leaders talking of cuts in federal spending to eliminate the federal budget deficit, analysts said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, consumer spending is slowing and a sharp rally by the dollar has made exports of U.S. goods more expensive, which could slow sales growth overseas.</p>
<p>History also shows GDP growth tends to slow in the year following a presidential election, Laughlin added.</p>
<p>&quot;All these factors could lead to a more sustained economic slowdown in 1997,&quot; she said. &quot;We could even raise speculation of a recession.&quot;</p>
<p>Michael Krauss, managing director and chief technical strategist at Chase Securities Inc., agreed with Laughlin that the T-bond will gain if the economy weakens further.</p>
<p>However, he said intermediate-dated Treasury paper could benefit even more than the bond. &quot;The bond is not the asset of choice right now,&quot; he added.</p>
