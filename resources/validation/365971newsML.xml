<p>The clouds of utility deregulation are going away at Public Service Enterprise Group Inc, chief financial officer Robert C. Murray told Reuters.</p>
<p>Noting industry changes &quot;are coming faster than many people thought possible,&quot; he said the transition &quot;will cause us some pain. But we're not being gored&quot; like many feared.</p>
<p>Although it is still to early to tell, the read on New Jersey's deregulation proposeals is pretty good, he continued.</p>
<p>The director of state governmental affiars at the company's utility subsidiary, Frederick D. DeSanti, said &quot;I am very pleased with the way the (various) coalitions are coming forward&quot; in support of needed tax changes and securitization of stranded assets during talks on deregulations.</p>
<p>The business community was &quot;very moderate&quot; at last week's initial hearings on the New Jersey Master Energy Plan, he pointed out in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been through (deregulation) on the (natural) gas side,&quot; Murray pointed out, noting the company is the largest natural gas distribution utility east of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>He also said the pressure off a negative debt rating change appears to be off following talks with Standard &amp; Poors and Moody's. Both agencies have the company on watch with negative implications.</p>
<p>Murray said Moody's has said it is not changing Enterprise's ratings, but the negative indicators will not be lifted until the Salem Generating Station comes back on line.</p>
<p>PSE&amp;G, which has a 42.59 percent interest in Salem, has said it expects the plant to be back in operation this summer.</p>
<p>In December, S&amp;P revised the outlook of PECO Energy Co, which has a similar Salem stake, to positive citing a Pennsylavania law allowing securitization of stranded costs.</p>
<p>Securitization has been proposed by New Jersey regulators, but the legislature has taken no action, DeSanti noted.</p>
<p>PSE&amp;G's &quot;real challenge&quot; under deregulation, according to senior vice president Alfred C. Koeppe, is changing the company's culture &quot;to offense from defense.&quot;</p>
<p>Stating the company's &quot;strength is our people,&quot; he said the stability of the six year contracts PSE&amp;G has reached with its unions means the utility has the potential of finding additional work for its field forces from others in need of quality help.
