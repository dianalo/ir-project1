<p>The U.S. Marine Corps said on Friday it was investigating two bloody and &quot;disgusting&quot; incidents in which medals were pounded into the chests of young paratroopers in a hazing, or initiation, ritual.</p>
<p>The 1991 and 1993 incidents at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, caught on videotape obtained and screened by NBC and CNN, showed Marines writhing as others pounded the spiked medals onto their chests through thin tee-shirts.</p>
<p>The ritual, marking completion of preparation for parachute duty, is the second recent controversy to cloud U.S. military training programmes. The Army is investigating widespread accusations by female recruits of harassment and rape by male drill instructors.</p>
<p>&quot;I am outraged that Marines would participate in such disgusting behaviour. There is absolutely no excuse for this type of behaviour,&quot; the Marine Corps commandant, Gen. Charles Krulak, said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>He said the corps, which prides itself on its military toughness, had learned of the videotaped incidents earlier this month and prompt action was taken to investigate and end any such practices.</p>
<p>Calling the hazing &quot;shocking and degrading,&quot; corps officials said the five-year time limit had expired for judicial punishment such as jail for trainers involved in the 1991 incident.</p>
<p>They said courts martial and even penalties of jail were still a possibility in the 1993 incident and any active trainers found to be responsible could be dismissed from the corps in either incident.</p>
<p>Most of the Marines on the 1991 videotape have been identified and an initial assessment indicates that nine remain on active duty, the Marines said. The service was still working on identifying those in the 1993 tape.</p>
<p>&quot;I am committed to ridding the corps of such heinous behaviour and to ensuring that Marines treat each other with dignity, care and concern,&quot; said Krulak, who designated Lt. Gen. Charles Wilhelm, commander of Marine forces in the Atlantic region, to head the investigation.</p>
<p>Corps officials said Wilhelm had authority to bring active Marines involved back to Camp Lejeune and to take whatever action was necessary.</p>
<p>Revelations of the hazing incidents come as former world heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe announced he would interrupt his career to join the corps.</p>
<p>Bowe said on Thursday he had enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve. He is due to train at Camp Lejeune.</p>
