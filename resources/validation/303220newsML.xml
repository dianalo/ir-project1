<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss defend wartime gold shipments to Iberia.</title>

<p>The Swiss National Bank ackowledged on Monday that it had sent around 70 shipments of Nazi gold to Spain and Portugal during World War Two, but defended the transfers as routine commercial payments.</p>
<p>SNB board member Jean-Pierre Roth told Swiss television the central bank was simply acting as a clearing house for trade between the three countries.</p>
<p>&quot;Portugal and Spain exported goods to Germany during the war and were paid in gold. The payments took place in Berne. The (German) Reichsbank made the payments to the two central banks in accounts they held there at the SNB,&quot; Roth said.</p>
<p>&quot;From time to time both countries asked the SNB to organise gold transfers to Spain and Portugal. We looked in our archives and found around 70 such transfers in 1943 and 1944,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Portugal and Spain paid for the transport, and the Swiss did not profit from the transactions, he added.</p>
<p>Roth was responding to allegations by U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato that Switzerland was actively involved in shipping gold for the Nazis.</p>
<p>On Sunday, he released a newly discovered 1946 memo from a U.S. agent in Berne that said the Swiss had sent 280 truckloads of looted Nazi gold to Iberia at the height of the war.</p>
<p>&quot;This document proves that the Swiss claim of neutrality was pure nonsense,&quot; send D'Amato, who as head of the Senate Banking Committee has been probing Swiss-Nazi wartime commerce.</p>
<p>The agent said the gold was worth up to two billion Swiss francs ($500 million) at the time. Looted gold likely came from the central banks of occupied Europe and concentration camp victims.</p>
<p>The Allies had warned Spain and Portugal that they would not tolerate Germany directly shipping gold to the two neutral Iberian nations, thus creating a role for neutral Switzerland to act as a conduit for such shipments.</p>
<p>Switzerland agreed in 1946 to pay compensation to the Allies for looted gold its banks handled.</p>
<p>Roth said the SNB had found no trace in its archives after 10 years of searching that the Swiss had ever asked Germany to melt down looted gold bars to disguise their origins, as critics have alleged.</p>
