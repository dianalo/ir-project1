<p>Kimiko Date said she had no regrets about leaving the tennis life behind following her straight-set defeat to rising star Martina Hingis on Friday at the season-ending Chase Championships.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not happy or sad,&quot; said Date, who waved cheerfully to the crowd of 12,116 at Madison Square Garden that saluted her after she fell 6-1 6-2 to Hingis in the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm free of everything. I'm just looking forward to many things I want to try. I'm just looking forward.&quot;</p>
<p>The 26-year-old Date had announced earlier this season that this would be the final tournament of her seven-year career, and the tour threw an on-court retirement party for her following her first-round match Tuesday.</p>
<p>But Date's life after tennis was delayed three days as she prolonged her career with a first-round win over second seed Monica Seles, who quit in the first set due to her injured shoulder.</p>
<p>Date was overmatched against the 16-year-old Hingis on Friday, but the Japanese star said she felt no disappointment since she had given her best.</p>
<p>&quot;Hingis has so much power I was kind of overwhelmed,&quot; Date said through an interpreter. &quot;There was nothing I could do.&quot;</p>
<p>Date said it was not relief she felt at the end of the match, but pride.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't feel that relieved,&quot; she said. &quot;I was just glad for what I accomplished.&quot;</p>
<p>The 26-year-old Date, currently ranked ninth after reaching a career-best number four last year, established a batch of firsts as Japan's greatest player.</p>
<p>Among her many achievements, Date was the first Japanese to reach the Wimbledon semifinals (1996) and the French Open semifinals (1995).</p>
<p>In 1994 she became the first Japanese in 21 years to appear in a Grand Slam singles semifinals when she advanced to the final four at the Australian Open, a feat last achieved by Kazuko Sawamatsu at the 1973 Australian Open.</p>
<p>Date said she was pleased that she could make her farewell appearance at the WTA Tour championships.</p>
<p>&quot;I was just happy that I was able to be on court at the year-ending tournament, as one of the top 16 players,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now is the beginning of the second stage of my life. This (tennis) career seemed very long, but in fact it was very short. I feel both ways.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked what she might miss about tennis, Date said: &quot;Playing under big pressure in important tournaments and travelling a lot. I won't be able to see that much of all the friends I made in my career.</p>
<p>&quot;But I'm looking forward to my future life much bigger.&quot;</p>
