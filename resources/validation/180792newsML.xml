<p>The head of the U.N.'s food agency stepped into a debate about intensive farming on Monday, saying farmers would be forced to boost production from existing land to match the world's soaring food needs next century.</p>
<p>Jacques Diouf, director general of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, said ahead of a global food summit that intensive agriculture, widely criticised by environmentalists, was the only way to reduce hunger as the world's population expands.</p>
<p>&quot;There is land, but what we are saying is that good land is not available for increased production,&quot; Diouf told reporters two days before the opening of the summit called to halve the number of hungry people in 19 years.</p>
<p>After two decades in which more and more land has come under the plough, barely any new soil is left for farming without damaging forests or threatening fragile ecosystems, he said.</p>
<p>But he insisted his call was not a charter to wealthy food-surplus nations to use ever greater amounts of chemicals.</p>
<p>&quot;The focus should not be on those who are already overproducing, using too much pesticide,&quot; he told a briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;We should go towards intensification of agriculture but in a sustainable way,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>World leaders have agreed in advance of the November 13-17 summit to work to reduce the number of people suffering chronic hunger or malnutrition to half the current 840 million by 2015.</p>
<p>It says the planet has to lift food production by 75 percent in the next three decades just to keep up with population rises.</p>
<p>U.N. experts predict three billion extra mouths to feed as population expands from 5.7 billion today to a projected 8.7 billion in 2030. That means the per capita area of land available for food production is officially forecast to shrink.</p>
<p>But environmentalists gathering on the margins of the summit criticised governments for neglecting new resources while banking on utopian increases in yields to come to the rescue.</p>
<p>Huge success in boosting yields during the &quot;green revolution&quot; of the 1960s, when pesticides, fertilisers and new varieties were all heavily promoted, are unlikely to continue, environmental newspaper Earth Times said in a summit edition.</p>
<p>Quoting findings by the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute, it said governments in almost every country had allowed productive land to be washed away by erosion.</p>
<p>FAO says the amount of land most suited to arable cropping is about 11 percent of the earth's total land surface.</p>
<p>With the possible exception of Africa and Latin America, expansion to less suitable soil means greater risk to the environment, higher fertiliser costs and increased threat of crop failure, the Rome-based agency said in a summit document.</p>
<p>Western analysts argue that while more needs to be done in the developing world to increase production, by far the biggest potential for basic commodities like grain lies in the industrialised exporting nations led by the United States.</p>
<p>The problem is less how to grow food than how to distribute it to where people need it most, one Europen food analyst said.</p>
<p>Organisers say that will be high on the summit's agenda as it makes pre-prepared pledges to fight hunger, though decisions on how to respond will be left to the FAO's 174 member states.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now, global food production is adequate. If there are 800 million hungry it is because the availability of food does not apply,&quot; Kay Killingsworth, secretary general of the summit, told reporters. &quot;But we also need to sustain production in countries where the need is greatest.&quot;</p>
