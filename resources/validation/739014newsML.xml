<p>Cambodia's powerful co-premier Hun Sen on Friday shrugged off increasing international efforts to solve his country's political crisis and told foreigners, including ASEAN, to stay out of the country's affairs.</p>
<p>As Hun Sen warned against meddling, First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the man Hun Sen ousted in a bloody July 5-6 coup, opened talks in Bangkok with three foreign ministers from the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
<p>The usually talkative Ranariddh was mobbed by reporters as he arrived for the talks with the foreign ministers of Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, but declined to speak.</p>
<p>Ministers meeting him were Prachuab Chaiyasarn of Thailand, Ali Alatas of Indonesia and Domingo Siazon of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Hun Sen, speaking to reporters in Cambodia, said earlier on Friday that he would meet the three ASEAN envoys in Phnom Penh on Saturday, but appeared weary of their diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>Cambodia, he said, could survive without ASEAN.</p>
<p>&quot;I will sit down and listen to them,&quot; he said of the envoys, but added, &quot;No foreigner can control Hun Sen. I will ask them to finish the problem tomorrow so they won't have to bother about Cambodia any more... Please don't interfere.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If they don't let us join ASEAN, we won't join. If we don't join ASEAN, it won't be the death of us,&quot; he said during a visit to a pagoda about 60 km (36 miles) south of Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>In Bangkok, a Ranariddh aide said royalist forces of the ousted first prime minister would only wage armed resistance against Hun Sen as a last resort.</p>
<p>&quot;The prince does not want to have bloodshed. The first solution is to negotiate and get Hun Sen to respect the Paris peace agreement and restore democracy,&quot; said Ahmad Yahaya, a royalist FUNCINPEC member of parliament in Ranariddh's group.</p>
<p>&quot;If we don't achieve this, as a final resort we would have to create a resistance movement. But it is still too early to say we want to create such a movement,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Ahmad Yahaya said FUNCINPEC was still in government although Hun Sen had violently evicted royalist forces from Phnom Penh and declared Ranariddh was no longer the first premier.</p>
<p>Therefore, it had to pursue peaceful negotiations first to find a political solution.</p>
<p>&quot;But ... if they attack us we have no choice but to fight back,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Ahmad Yahaya also said that Cambodian Foreign Minister Ung Huot, who has been nominated to replace Ranariddh as first premier by FUNCINPEC remnants and backed by Hun Sen, was not a popular party member.</p>
<p>The nomination was approved by Hun Sen's party but Washington has refused to recognise it, saying there was no evidence that Ung Huot's selection was on a free and democratic basis.</p>
<p>&quot;He should be ashamed of himself. He cannot do the job and he's not popular in FUNCINPEC,&quot; Ahmad Yahaya added.</p>
<p>In another move to end the Cambodian crisis, the U.S. State Department said on Thursday former congressman Stephen Solarz was being sent to Asia on a special mission to work with regional countries on Cambodia.</p>
<p>Solarz will leave on Friday or Saturday for a trip to Beijing, Tokyo, Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Phnom Penh, where he will meet Hun Sen, spokesman Nicholas Burns said.</p>
<p>&quot;During high-level meetings in those capitals he will discuss with those governments how best to uphold and restore the principles of the 1991 Paris peace accords so that all Cambodian parties can operate freely and free and fair elections can take place in 1998,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United States has been pushing for Hun Sen to recreate a coalition with Ranariddh's royalist party and recommit to democratic principles, including holding another round of elections, as already planned, next year.</p>
<p>Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab on Friday denied ASEAN was interfering in Cambodia's affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to see peace reported in Cambodia as soon as possible. But we have no intention to interfere in the internal matters of Cambodia. We will use the Paris agreement as our guideline in dealing with the issue,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>ASEAN was a co-signatory of the 1991 Paris accords which ended years of conflict and laid the grounds for U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993 which Ranariddh won.</p>
<p>ASEAN, which also includes Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam, decided last week to postpone Phnom Penh's admission in response to Ranariddh's overthrow.</p>
<p>Cambodia had been due to join ASEAN, together with Burma and Laos, at next week's annual foreign ministerial conference in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>ASEAN Secretary-General Ajit Singh said on Friday that Cambodia would still attend the group's foreign ministerial meeting next week as an observer with a delegation headed by Ung Huot.</p>
<p>Ung Huot appealed to ASEAN on Friday to admit the strife-torn country to the regional grouping at the foreign ministers' meeting.</p>
