<p>French bond futures recovered from a cautious start to climb on Tuesday with other European bond markets as hopes for a timely EMU start were given a lift after EU official Yves Thibault de Silguy was quoted as saying the three percent deficit target need not be strictly applied.</p>
<p>The September bond future broke out of its recent range as the European bond rally, led by Italian bonds, triggered stops in the French market, pushing the contract above 129.</p>
<p>The contract tracked movements in the Bund future closely and after a brief setback before the close, scrambled back above 129 during the GLOBEX session.  </p>
<p>French finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn knocked the contract and September PIBOR off their highs when he said an audit of French public finances, due to be ready by July 21, could show the deficit had worsened.</p>
<p>However analysts said most investors expected the audit to show a deterioration in the deficit and if anything the comments suggested the government was preparing the ground for some flexibility in sticking to its spending commitments this year.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that's the case, the government has been doing that deliberately,&quot; David Brickman, European economist at Yamaichi International said.  </p>
<p>The franc came under slight pressure after the remarks, falling to a low of 3.3767 against the mark, which was also Friday's low, on the back of selling by non-resident investors out of New York, traders said.</p>
<p>September PIBOR resisted the weakness in the currency and climbed to its highest level this week on the back of buying by two non-residents funds. They were said by traders to have bought about 10,000 lots between 96.58 and 96.60.</p>
<p>The short end of the French yield curve outperformed Germany with the two-year spread narrowing two basis points to 15.  </p>
<p>One trader said despite the bearishness of many in the market and the caution of end investors ahead of the public finance audit in July, the feeling that investors would need to put some of their cash into bonds before the end of June was helping to buoy sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;Traders are in the selling mood...but we know a lot of fund managers are underinvested in Europe and they must invest before the end of the June,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 10-year area of the French curve was little changed compared with Germany although five-year notes outperformed for the second successive day.  </p>
<p>There was little reaction to Bank of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet's remarks that France needed to keep trimming spending and continue with structural reforms to help boost employment.</p>
<p>&quot;It was all so familiar, he said what we expected,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Brickman said the fact Trichet declined to be drawn on stressing that the three percent deficit target needed to be hit was a sign of the shifting ground within Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;He's being pragmatic, to be fair he's not the only one who may have moved his stance. As the years have gone by, more and more people are saying there's no point in hitting three percent on the nose,&quot; he said.</p>
