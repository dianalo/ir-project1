<headline>DPEF going in right direction - Italy's Bertinotti.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-05-28</dateline>

<p>Italy's hard-left leader, the fiercest critic of any cuts in social spending, said on Thursday that the draft of the government's three-year economic plan appeared to be going in the right direction.</p>
<p>&quot;We're waiting to see the final text tomorrow,&quot; Bertinotti told Reuters at the Chamber of Deputies (lower house) after parliamentary party leaders from the ruling centre-left alliance met the government earlier for talks on the document.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there are, so to say, differences of approach, but we appreciate moves in the direction that we had hoped for, that is a different ratio between spending cuts and increased revenues and a greater focus on unemployment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Union sources say the document, called the DPEF, which the cabinet is due to approve on Friday, sets a 2.8 percent deficit-GDP ratio for 1998. Official sources say the government intends to make deficit cuts of 25 trillion lire next year.</p>
<p>Controversy has raged over how much of this should come from spending cuts, including on pensions and welfare spending.</p>
<p>Trades unions and Bertinotti's Communist Refoundation party, which ensures the government's parliamentary majority, are opposed to deep cuts.</p>
<p>Newspapers have reported that two-thirds of the 1998 deficit reductions would come from spending cuts and one-third from extra revenue but Maurizio Pieroni, Greens party Senate (upper house) leader, said on Thursday said the mix would be 60-40.</p>
<p>Bertinotti said the government forecast a fall in annual unemployment in the order of 0.7 percent. &quot;This shows a reversal of the trend but obviously more can be done.&quot;</p>
<p>He also called for &quot;a sign of a fight against tax fraud and above all to bring the question of pensions into the discussion on the welfare state without prejudicing the outcome&quot;.</p>
<p>But Bertinotti signalled no immediate softening of his opposition to welfare cuts. &quot;We are going into these discussions with the position that is already well known, that is that pensions should be defended,&quot; he said.</p>
