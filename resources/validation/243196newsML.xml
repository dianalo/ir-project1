<title>ROMANIA: Romanian crude oil output down in November.</title>
<headline>Romanian crude oil output down in November.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1996-12-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Romania produced 524,350 tonnes of crude oil in November, some 45,000 tonnes down from the previous month and 2.75 percent less than in November last year, the Industry Ministry said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Ministry's oil and gas department said gas output in November was 1.61 billion cubic metres, some 11 million up on October, but 9.9 percent down year on year.</p>
<p>Crude output this year is envisaged to stay close to the previous year's level of 6.7 million tonnes. To meet domestic demand and keep its 12 refineries going, Romania has to resort to imports, which in the first 10 months of 1996 amounted to 5.8 million tonnes, according to latest statistics.</p>
<p>In a bid to raise crude output -- which has been falling over the past 20 years from peaks of 14 million tonnes in the early 1970s -- Romania has launched a licensing round for 15 onshore and offshore prospective oil blocks.</p>
<p>The National Agency for Mineral Resources recently said it had received eight &quot;block-offers&quot; from companies bidding in the tender, which it considered a success.</p>
<p>Some 50 oil operators have bought packages of data on the 15 blocks. Offers will be evaluated by the end of January 1997 and successful bidders may start work on the blocks next June. -- Luli Popescu, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264</p>
