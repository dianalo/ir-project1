<p>U.S.-sponsored arms deliveries to Bosnia are being jeopardised by Moslem and Croat failure to cooperate in creating a unified army, a U.S. government spokesman said in Sarajevo on Thursday.</p>
<p>He denied reports that arms deliveries to Bosnia had been suspended but indicated that this could happen quite soon if compliance with U.S. conditions attached to the military assistance did not improve.</p>
<p>&quot;From the very onset of the Train and Equip programme we made it clear that there are a number of conditions which must be met,&quot; U.S. spokesman James Hutcheson said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is slippage in meeting those conditions. We have asked why and we have demanded that remedial measures be taken. We expect a response within a week to 10 days and at that time a decision will be made about whether to suspend deliveries.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States has pledged to provide Bosnia's Moslem- Croat federation with $100 million worth of arms and training to deter aggression and defend its territory.</p>
<p>But the condition of that award -- and of other equipment deliveries to Bosnian being arranged by the U.S. from countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Malaysia -- has always been the formation of a unified military force.</p>
<p>Hutcheson said implementation of a new defence law, agreed only after months of haggling, was lagging. Bosnian sources told Reuters little progress had been made in creating a unified command structure for the joint army.</p>
<p>The Croatian state news agency HINA on Wednesday quoted federation defence minister Vladimir Soljic as saying the U.S. government had suspended arms deliveries as a result of dissatisfaction over slow implementation of the defence law.</p>
<p>Hutcheson confirmed that the United States was unhappy and had made its feelings known to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and to federation President Kresimir Zubak.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be wrong to say deliveries have been halted but we have expressed very serious concerns and such a step could be taken if there's no satisfactory response,&quot; Hutcheson said.</p>
<p>He added that the U.S. government continued to have questions about the presence of foreign forces -- Islamic fighters left over from the 43-month Bosnian war -- which could also adversely affect the Train and Equip programme.</p>
<p>Only two plane-loads of arms have been delivered to Bosnia to date, both in late August.</p>
<p>U.S. officials at the time described that equipment -- mostly M-16 rifles, machine-guns, ammunition and tactical radios -- as a symbolic down-payment on what federation forces could expect if they cooperated with U.S. guidelines.</p>
<p>&quot;We anticipate that arms will be delivered only if and when the conditions laid down under our laws are met -- and I mean met continuously,&quot; Hutcheson said.</p>
<p>Bosnia's Moslem, Serb and Croat factions fought one another during the Bosnian war, which ended in December of 1995.</p>
<p>Moslems and Croats are now partners in a shaky federation, brokered and held together largely by U.S. diplomacy and controlling 51 per cent of the country.</p>
<p>A Serb republic, better armed and equipped than the Moslems and Croats, administers the other 49 per cent of Bosnia.</p>
