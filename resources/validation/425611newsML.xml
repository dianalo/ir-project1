<p>Taiwan's proposed 1997/98 budget pours major new funds into public works in a bid to rekindle its &quot;Asian dragon&quot; economy, but fortifying the island against muscular adversary China remains the top priority.</p>
<p>The cabinet on Thursday proposed to parliament a budget of T$1.2435 trillion (US$45.22 billion) for fiscal 1997/98 starting in July, seeking a 4.1 percent rise over 1996/97.</p>
<p>As always, the single biggest spending item is defence -- a reflection of Taiwan's nearly half-century rivalry with the communist People's Republic of China across the Taiwan strait.</p>
<p>The biggest increase goes to a special public-works budget dubbed &quot;economic development&quot;, which surges 12.4 percent in a reflection of the Nationalist government's goal of acting as handmaid to a slowly gathering economic recovery.</p>
<p>Taipei proposed that defence spending, budgeted separately from the main plan, rise by 3.1 percent to T$260.2 billion, equivalent to one-fifth of the total non-defence budget.</p>
<p>In addition, the cabinet proposed a special T$47.4 billion budget for purchase of advanced French and U.S. warplanes, part of a nine-year T$300.7 billion fighter procurement fund.</p>
<p>Taiwan says it needs the 60 Mirage and 150 F16 fighters to counter a steady modernisation of China's three-million strong People's Liberation Army, put its growing military clout on dramatic display during eight months of war games and missile tests near Taiwan in 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>Beijing said it mounted the manoeuvres to chill any ideas of establishing an independent Taiwan, especially as the island's people went to the polls in March 1996 for the first popular presidential election in Chinese history.</p>
<p>Yet despite its increase in dollar terms, the defence budget actually shrinks by 0.2 percentage points relative to the total budget, slipping to 20.9 percent from 21.1 percent.</p>
<p>Such was not the case for the economic development portion of the budget, which swells to T$132.3 billion, or 10.6 percent of total spending, up 0.8 percentage points from a year ago.</p>
<p>The category includes all but the biggest infrastructure projects such as superhighways and the high-speed railway.</p>
<p>&quot;In the present situation it's only natural that we have a bigger bite for defence spending relative to other cultural, social and welfare spending and economic development,&quot; said Chung Chin of the Chung-hwa Institution for Economic Research.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, we cannot afford to overlook the economic side continuously, year by year. I think this year's budget is a healthy increase in that direction,&quot; she added. &quot;The main drive for this year and coming years must on the economic situation.&quot;</p>
<p>The proposed budget, which will go to the Legislative Yuan on March 10 with an approval deadline of May 31, plans for a T$122.9 billion deficit, down an annual 20 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;This budget shows our government's improving financial condition and financial controls,&quot; said Wei Duan, head of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, which released the budget.</p>
<p>The proposal reiterates Taiwan's goal of balancing the national budget by 2000/01 and proposes issuing T$100 billion in construction bonds to help ease the deficit.</p>
<p>The directorate said the T$47.4 billion in extraordinary defence spending should be added to the nominal deficit to get a true picture of the spending shortfall.</p>
<p>At T$170.3 billion, this actual deficit still would mark a 47 percent reduction from the last budget, the agency said.</p>
<p>Major sectors of the budget include defence (20.9 percent); education, science and culture (15.3 percent); debt service (14.1 percent), social welfare (12.7 percent); pensions (12.6 percent); economic development (10.6 percent); and normal administrative expense (9.2 percent).</p>
<p>The cabinet earmarked only T$25.7 billion for Taiwan's 12 biggest infrastructure projects, but nevertheless plans to speed up infrastructure construction by mobilising some T$240.4 billion in funds left over from previous years due to delays.</p>
