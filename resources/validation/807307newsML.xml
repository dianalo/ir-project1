<p>Yen-based Tokyo gold futures ended mixed on Monday and platinum group metals (PGMs) finished lower, as prices shed some of their early gains due to the yen's recovery against the dollar, traders said. Activity was lacklustre.</p>
<p>A sharp slide in the U.S. stock market late last week was seen supportive for the gold market, although early gains were curbed by the yen's recovery.</p>
<p>Gold prices ranged from three yen per gram lower to two yen firmer. Benchmark June was up one yen at 1,318 yen.  </p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold was quoted at $326.45/85 an ounce at 0727 GMT, against $325.80/30 in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Activity in the bullion market was quiet due to holidays in the Hong Kong market. Renewed declines in the U.S. stock market may give a modest boost to gold, although the upside at $330 appeared hard to break through,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>In gold futures, traders said uncertainty over near-term direction in currencies is likely to cap further gains.</p>
<p>Traders said losses in PGMs were regarded as a continuing technical correction. Palladium futures were down five to 33 yen per gram. Benchmark June was off 18 at 703 yen.</p>
