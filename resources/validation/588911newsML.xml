<p>The Bundesbank on Thursday declined to comment on reports in a German newspaper that the Bonn government was considering using the central bank's gold reserves to cover budgetary shortfalls.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot comment on the report,&quot; a Bundesbank spokeswoman said in answer to a query.</p>
<p>In its Thursday edition the Handelsblatt newspaper wrote that Bonn's ruling Christian Democrat and Free Democrat coalition was considering using gold reserves to manage a mountain of debt.</p>
<p>The newspaper also wrote that sources close to the Bundesbank directorate had said they had received signals from Bonn that such a move might be considered.</p>
<p>The newspaper said that by revaluing its gold reserves, the Bundesbank could help free up hidden reserves. The paper wrote the Bundesbank currently holds 95 million ounces of gold which it has valued at 13.7 billion marks. The market value of the reserves however is seen at 57 billion marks, the paper reported.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry has said it has no plans to sell the gold.</p>
