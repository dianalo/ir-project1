<p>Poland's co-ruling Peasant Party (PSL), seeking to boost its ratings before parliamentary polls, said on Wednesday that the fight against unemployment and curbing the trade deficit were economic priorities.</p>
<p>&quot;We need new systemic solutions which would support the creation of new jobs,&quot; PSL president Waldemar Pawlak told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said the unemployment rate, one of the highest in Europe at 13.5 percent, could be substantially reduced only if the trade deficit was lowered.</p>
<p>&quot;Each $1 billion of imported consumer goods annually can be translated into 50,000 jobs,&quot; Pawlak said.</p>
<p>Last year, the trade gap soared to $8.2 billion from $1.8 billion in 1995 and analysts say it is likely to reach $12 billion in 1997.</p>
<p>Analysts say that in the short term the deficit does not pose a threat to the economy, because imports are dominated by investment goods but that in a longer perspective it may undermine currency reserves.</p>
<p>Pawlak said his party would propose new regulations stimulating exports and encouraging job creation.</p>
<p>He said the government should offer tax reliefs for exporters and improve the mechanism of providing credit guarantees for them.</p>
<p>He said the central bank should not allow the domestic currency, the zloty, to appreciate in real terms. Such appreciation in 1996 badly hit many exporters, he added.</p>
<p>But he said a one-off zloty devaluation, which some opposition politicians propose, was not necessary.</p>
<p>Pawlak said that to cut unemployment, local authorities should be allowed to keep the personal income tax of workers for whom they created jobs.</p>
<p>In selected cases, the treasury should also provide funds for topping up wages to the mandatory minimum for a worker whose employer cannot afford paying the full amount.</p>
<p>Pawlak said his party, in a coalition with ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) since 1993, would try to push through some of the measures before the polls scheduled around September.</p>
<p>But some would have to be addressed by the next government and parliament, he said.</p>
<p>Recent opinion polls show that the Peasant Party, which is trying to expand its electoral support beyond its traditional rural base, is backed by between 10 and 15 percent of voters.</p>
<p>Analysts say the party, which is ready to form a government after the elections with eityer the ex-communists or the opposition Solidarity electoral bloc, may hold a balance of power in the next parliament.</p>
