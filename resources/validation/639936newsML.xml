<p>Indonesian palm olein prices edged down in late trading on Thursday, with buying interest improving following a rebound in Malaysia, traders said.</p>
<p>They said palm olein was quoted at 1,395-1,400 rupiah/kg in Jakarta, down from 1,400 rupiah at the opening. Crude palm oil was done at 1,213 rupiah/kg at a 500-tonne tender in Medan.</p>
<p>&quot;The rebound in Malaysia saw buyers coming back into the market, but prices continued to suffer,&quot; one trader said. &quot;Buyers were making bids below the market range.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said the export taxes for crude palm oil and its products announced by the government were within expectations.  </p>
<p>The finance ministry said the tax on crude palm oil was reduced to $39.20 a tonne in June from $47.32 in May. The tax on RBD palm olein was down to $55.30 from $68.60 while that on RBD palm oil was cut to $42.64 from $53.04.</p>
<p>The tax on crude olein was reduced to $58.80 from $66.95.</p>
<p>&quot;The taxes are within market expectations, and will help to improve export competitiveness,&quot; one trader said.</p>
