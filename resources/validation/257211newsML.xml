<p>Marseille marked the start of a new era on Sunday with a 3-0 victory over Auxerre in the French first division -- their second win over the European Cup quarter-finalists in six days.</p>
<p>&quot;To beat the reigning French champions twice in the same week is an excellent performance. I could not have dreamed of a better start to my taking charge,&quot; said new chairman Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who officially took over the club on Friday.</p>
<p>Former French international Xavier Gravelaine put the 1993 European champions on course with a 39th minute goal, then fellow striker Marc Libbra and left back Hamada Jambay sealed the victory with two more in the last seven minutes.</p>
<p>Marseille, who became the only French side to have won the European Cup under disgraced former chairman Bernard Tapie, also beat Auxerre 3-2 at home to put them out of the League Cup on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Auxerre remain fifth in the standings, while Marseille climb from 13th to 10th, 15 points adrift of leaders Monaco but only five behind the defending champions after extending their unbeaten run in the league to seven matches.</p>
<p>Marseille, who went through a poor patch earlier in their first season back from enforced relegation in 1994 over a match-rigging scandal under Tapie, have played some of their best matches against their biggest rivals.</p>
<p>Their recovery began with a 3-1 home win over Monaco on November 6 and they came away from the visit to Paris St-Germain last month with a 0-0 draw.</p>
<p>Gravelaine took a through ball from midfielder Eric Roy, and slipped past Christian Henna into the penalty box on the left.</p>
<p>The striker shot diagonally across goal just before Franck Silvestre's lunging tackle to slot the ball inside the far post beyond the diving Fabien Cool for his sixth goal of the season.</p>
<p>Marseille survived Auxerre's push for an equaliser in the second half, then hit them on the break through Libbra, who looked marginally offside when he ran onto Italian defender Alberto Malusci's ball.</p>
<p>Auxerre coach Guy Roux said: &quot;It's a shame that the second goal which put an end to the match should have been offside. Our marseillaise week has been bad. We conceded six goals, two of them sullied by illegality. It's a custom we thought had disappeared in Marseille.&quot;</p>
<p>Roux believed one of Marseille's goals in the cup match should have been disallowed as well as Libbra's strike on Sunday.</p>
<p>Jambay, who scored Marseille's third on Tuesday, surged past defender Frederic Danjou onto a pass by substitute Ludovic Asuar to shot past Cool from the left four minutes from time.</p>
<p>Marseille coach Gerard Gili said: &quot;We managed to beat one of the European Cup favourites. We did so with a lot of aggression, especially in the duels. It was a good fight.&quot;</p>
<p>Auxerre might have gone behind earlier when Cool had to change direction to stop a free kick from Roy that was deflected by the wall in the fifth minute.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Cool twisted back in midflight to push out a shot from Gravelaine deflected by midfielder Christian Henna's backside.</p>
<p>Auxerre's best chances came in the second half when they took the game to Marseille.</p>
<p>On the hour, Algerian midfielder Moussa Saib brought a diving save from Andreas Koepke, who also kept a clean sheet for Germany against Portugal 24 hours earlier.</p>
<p>Three minutes later, Nigerian defender Taribo West broke through the defence with only Koepke to beat but he pushed the ball too far forward allowing the keeper to reach it first.</p>
