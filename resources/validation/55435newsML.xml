<title>BOSNIA: New pressure on Bosnian Serbs over elections.</title>
<headline>New pressure on Bosnian Serbs over elections.</headline>

<text>
<p>A senior independent scrutineer urged on Monday that crucial municipal elections in Bosnia should be delayed until the main Bosnian Serb party renounced its demand for independence.</p>
<p>The municipal elections have already been put off until November but the recommendation by Edward Van Thijn, who headed a team of international monitors, implied that they could be delayed even longer.  </p>
<p>Van Thijn told reporters the hardline SDS party which led Bosnian Serbs during the war should also be forced to endorse Bosnian unity before the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe certified the outcome of general elections held on Saturday.</p>
<p>He said voting at stations monitored by the OSCE was mainly satisfactory. But he criticised inadequate polling lists, the inability of some polling stations to cope with the number of voters and the low number of Moslem refugees who returned to vote in Serb territory.</p>
<p>&quot;Until problems afflicting the integrity of the elections and freedom of movement are resolved, I recommend that municipal elections should not be held,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Despite at least 45 protests to the OSCE election commission by voters and parties, Van Thijn said the elections were &quot;well prepared and carried out successfully&quot;.</p>
