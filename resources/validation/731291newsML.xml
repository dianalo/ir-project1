<headline>NY precious metals end mixed, silver slumps.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-16</dateline>

<p>COMEX gold and silver futures saw another intraday rally fade away into a lower close Wednesday, with silver the focus of attack from funds, but platinum group metals (PGMs) managed to end higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Silver in particular now looks like its heading south for the summer,&quot; FIMAT New York trader John Tyree said.</p>
<p>&quot;September silver broke down out of the range of the past week, under pressure from selling by funds and locals at the close, but gold did not follow to the same extent as it had already been sold off heavily last week,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>COMEX September silver ended down 11.2 cents at $4.185 an ounce, breaking down out of its $4.40-4.24 range of the past week, though it ended just above the contract's lows at $4.175. Volume was only moderate though at 13,000 lots.</p>
<p>COMEX silver open interest rose 999 lots Tuesday to 99,155 contracts, and remains near its highest levels since April.</p>
<p>Last week's CFTC Commitment of Traders data showed funds had been slowly increasing net short positions in the previous two weeks to 2,254 lots on July 1, but these postions were outweighed by commercial net shorts of 15,698 lots.</p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot silver ended quoted $4.21/23 an ounce, its lowest levels since November 1993.</p>
<p>The spot gold/silver ratio recovered further to 75.4 as a result, its highest levels since January.</p>
<p>Low silver prices appear to be increasing the shortfall of newly refined silver relative to fabrication demand, by keeping this metal affordable to most fabricators, CPM Group managing director, Jeffrey Christian said.</p>
<p>Japanese silver demand rose 4.4 percent during the first quarter 1997, compared to the same period last year, he noted.</p>
<p>U.S. demand meanwhile appears to be increasing at least four to five percent this year, while Indian silver demand in the first five months of 1997 was up 10 percent on the same period last year, he said.</p>
<p>Strong demand for high grade silver from jewellry manufacturers in South Asia and the Middle East continues to drain silver from European refineries also, he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, COMEX August gold ended down 30 cents at $318.70 an ounce, testing the bottom of its range of the past week, with the August/December spread narrowing further to 3.3 cents. Estimated COMEX gold volume was a healthy 42,000 lots.</p>
<p>COMEX gold open interest rose a further 2,483 lots Tuesday to 217,370 contracts, and remains at its highest levels since February 1996, when gold prices saw a seven year high.</p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold ended quoted $317.80/30, compared to the London Wednesday afternoon fix at $319.50 and the New York close Tuesday around $318.50/00.</p>
<p>Implied gold lease rates rose further Wednesday to around 2.60 pct for one month, up from 2.35 pct Tuesday, as hedge funds borrowed to fund short positions, traders said.</p>
<p>Gold fixed at a 12 year low last week at $315.75 in London, in the wake of news of a sale of 167 tonnes of gold by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still bearish on gold, as there's still little incentive for investors, given potential central bank and producer selling, and given that overall commodity markets still have an disinflationary tone,&quot; Paine Webber senior analyst Bernard Savaiko said.</p>
<p>In news Wednesday the U.S. CPI inflation for June was up 0.1 percent, while the seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.4 pct during the first six months of 1997 was the lowest since a 1.2 percent rise in the January-June period in 1965.</p>
<p>&quot;But the gold market is at a point where it could see some excitement, given the extent of open interest, but it would need a break of $325-327 on the upside to trigger a major shortcovering rally,&quot; Savaiko said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NYMEX platinum and palladium futures ended higher, with the physical market still highly backwardated, despite reports the first first shipment of Russian platinum in six months will arrive in Tokyo Thursday.</p>
<p>Shipments of palladium resumed last week and another palladium shipment is expected Friday.</p>
<p>NYMEX October platinum ended up $5.80 at $392.20 an ounce, while NYMEX September palladium closed up $5.35 at $157.65.</p>
<p>In the physical market, PGM lease rates eased a little though Wednesday to around 30 percent for one month platinum and 70 percent for one month palladium, refining sources said.</p>
