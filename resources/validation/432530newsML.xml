<p>French team boss Jean-Claude Skrela has urged his players not to squander the opportunity of completing what could be the first and last grand slam at Parc des Princes on Saturday.</p>
<p>Each of France's four previous grand slams have been completed on foreign soil and from next year they will play at the Stade de France. The new stadium is being currently built in a Paris stadium and will also be used for the 1998 World Cup soccer finals.</p>
<p>&quot;The players must not think that they've done the hardest part,&quot; Skrela said. &quot;The final was not against England, it will be against Scotland it will be tough.&quot;</p>
<p>Skrela, who played alongside Jean-Pierre Rives in a formidable back row when France completed the grand slam in 1977, retains clear memories of the triumph.</p>
<p>&quot;I had never won anything before that day and I realised that I had won a title at last, something nobody would forget,&quot; he said. &quot;I was right because people still talk about it now.&quot;</p>
<p>France, 80 minutes away from their first grand slam in 10 years, are confident despite the absence of several key players.</p>
<p>The morale was high at their training camp in a forest outside Paris even though dynamic prop Christian Califano has ruled himself out by punching an opponent in a league match at the weekend.</p>
<p>Scrum-half Philippe Carbonneau and fly-half Alain Penaud, both recovering from injuries, took part in Monday's training sessions and were confident they would start the match.</p>
<p>France's performance this season is all the more remarkable as 17 players have been sidelined for at least one match through injury or suspension. Twenty years ago the French were able to use the same 15 players throughout the campaign.</p>
<p>But adversity has brought the players more closely together and helped them beat Ireland and Wales before scoring their first win at Twickenham in 10 years on March 1 by overcoming England 23-20.</p>
<p>&quot;They can make history in many ways,&quot; said Skrela. &quot;Such things do not happen often in a player's career. I hope they understand what's at stake but I'm sure they do.&quot;</p>
