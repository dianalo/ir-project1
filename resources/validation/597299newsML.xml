<headline>LIFFE white sugar ends just firmer, thin.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>London's spot August white sugar contract held recent gains on Tuesday and managed to end just firmer in a thin market supported by talk of Russian buying.</p>
<p>&quot;The Russian offtake is the reason why the market is higher, supposedly...but people are a little dubious about selling and also about going short of August,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;I think being long of August/October is what most trade people would like to be.&quot;</p>
<p>August last traded 60 cents higher at $319.00 and October was up 40 cents at $308.60. Volume totalled a scant 743 lots, most of which was in August.</p>
<p>Since bursting higher by around $3 at the start of last week, August has been content to trade between $316 and resistance around $319.</p>
<p>Analysts said $323.00 could be another upside objective in the short term.</p>
