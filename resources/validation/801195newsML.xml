<p>TOP STORIES</p>
<p>- New Aspiration members of parliament have started jockeying for key ministerial posts amid indications of a cabinet reshuffle. The home of Sanoh Thienthong, the NAP secretary-general, has seen a steady flow of ministers desperate to keep their posts and newcomers eager to grab them in a shake-up. Chatichai Choonhavan, the prime minister's chief adviser on economic and foreign affairs, says he will ask the prime minister on Aug 21 about his decision on making changes to the cabinet line-up, and stresses that the image of the cabinet must be improved.

<p>- Cambodia's embattled Prince Norodom Ranariddh is awaiting the green light from Thailand to make a cross-border visit to about 33,000 displaced Cambodians who are taking refuge in territory controlled by troops loyal to him. The Cambodian first prime minister says he is willing to comply with whatever is decided by the Thai government and that he has no intention of exploiting his humanitarian visit for political reasons.

<p>- Major-General Charuek Arirajakaran has resigned from all Asiad panels citing his conflict with Sukhavich Rangsitpol, who chairs the Bangkok Asian Games Organising Committee. The move comes as the director-general of the Olympic Council of Asia is due here to fulfill a pledge to tell MPs, and the Thai people, what -or who- is threatening the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games.

<p>- Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh has bowed to tremendous lobbying pressure to guarantee all loans that local and foreign creditors have extended to the 42 failed finance companies - a pledge that could eventually cost taxpayers 100 billion baht. When the finance ministry on Aug 5 added 42 finance companies to the original list of 16 being shut down, the cabinet approved a bail-out package to calm public nerves about the shaky finance sector.

<p>- The government is likely to blame two former governors of the Bank of Thailand for approving huge loans to 58 ailing finance companies, although they provided the money under political pressure. Next Thursday, the government is expected to announce the findings of its inquiry into why the central bank pumped 430 billion baht into the troubled firms. (BANGKOK POST)</p>
