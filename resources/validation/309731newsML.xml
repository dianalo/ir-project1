<text>
<p>Arab Bank, one of the region's major financial institutions, reported on Wednesday a 18 percent rise in 1996 net profits to a record 95.7 million dinars ($135.2 million).</p>
<p>&quot;This is our best result since our founding and is due to better results in our branches in Europe, the U.S., the Far East and the Gulf states,&quot; Abdul-Majeed Shoman, chairman of Arab Bank plc, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The bank's total balance sheet rose by 4.3 percent to 13.481 billion dinars at end of December 1996 against 12.927 billion dinars in December 1995.</p>
<p>The results exclude subsidiaries and large holdings in Arab banks which are under the Arab Bank Group umbrella, with a total balance sheet of above $22.9 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Customer deposits rose by 10 percent to 6.396 billion dinars at end of 1996 from 5.797 billion dinars a year before. Loans rose 12 percent to 4.163 billion dinars against 3.711 billion dinars in 1995.</p>
<p>Total shareholders equity rose to 630 million dinars from 552 million dinars at end of 1995, the bank's balance sheet showed.</p>
<p>Long-term investments rose 58 percent to 727.6 million in 1996 from 450 million in 1995.</p>
<p>Shoman said Arab Bank, with over 300 branches globally, had expanded its international presence with two new representative offices in Shanghai, China and in Santiago, Chile.</p>
<p>The bank's shares, which account for over a third of the Amman Financial Market's capitalisation, have risen since the government unveiled late last year a package of reforms that include cancelling a 15 percent tax levied on companies' capital increases.</p>
<p>Shoman said the bank would keep a pledge to shareholders to distribute a bonus share once the tax is cancelled under new companies law due to be passed by parliament by April.</p>
<p>The bank, established in 1930, and the oldest Palestinian bank, also extended further its operations in Palestinian self-rule areas to a total of 16 branches in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>The bank joined in a 55 percent equity shareholding last year in the $15 million capitalised Arab Palestine Investment Bank which is due to begin operations soon.</p>
<p>Arab Bank has captured nearly 60 percent of the market share of a total $1.7 billion of bank deposits in the West Bank and Gaza since it began operations there two years ago.</p>
<p>Arab Bank was a latecomer to a banking boom that began after Middle East peace accords in 1993 allowed Jordanian banks to resume operations after a 26-year absence which followed Israel's seizure of the West Bank.</p>
