<p>Nasdaq shares skidded lower on Friday as U.S. stock markets capitulated in the face of a weaker dollar, concerns about corporate profits and widespread nervous volatility.</p>
<p>But while the Dow industrial average sank to its second biggest point loss ever, Nasdaq registered more modest losses in quiet trade dictated partly by the expiration of options.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite lost 24.66 points, or 1.55 percent, to close unofficially at 1562.03. It finally buckled under the blue chip decline, going back to levels last seen at the end of July after managing small gains the past two sessions.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an across-the-board decline but volume was relatively light,&quot; one trader said. &quot;It was a soft landing, with a lot of derivative action on the tape. Plus, it's a Friday in the summer, so there weren't many people around to stem the fall.&quot;</p>
<p>Larger-capitalization technology stocks tumbled as Dow blue chips fell. Bellwether Intel Corp lost 3-3/4 to 92-1/8 and Microsoft Corp shed 3-3/8 to 132-7/8.</p>
<p>The losses extended to nearly all segments of the composite and the technology sector, traders said. Dell Computer Corp was one of the few stocks to buck the widespread weakness, adding 1-1/16 to finish at 82-1/16.</p>
