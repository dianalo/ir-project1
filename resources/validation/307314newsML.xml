<headline>Thai stocks end lower, worries about property plan.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-01-14</dateline>

<p>Thai stocks finished 1.85 percent lower on Tuesday on mainly bank and finance issue selling linked to worries over whether banks would get involved in a government plan to help troubled property developers, brokers said.</p>
<p>The SET index retreated 15.22 points to 807.67 on 3.7 billion baht turnover.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors sold today as they believed banks which have problem loans extended to property developers may be unwilling to participate in plans by the government to help out property developers,&quot; said Samart Rusmeerojwong of James Capel Asia.  </p>
<p>The Thai cabinet decided on Tuesday to call on the state-owned Government Savings Bank and the Government Housing Bank to loan up to 20 billion baht of concessional mortgage loans to civil servants buying first homes.</p>
<p>In a property rescue package, the government said another 50 billion baht contributed by the government and commercial banks would be used for temporary takeovers of private property projects facing short-term financing problems.</p>
<p>&quot;It's also unclear where the government will get part of the 50 billion baht funds to help developers,&quot; Samart said.  </p>
<p>Brokers said another negative factor behind the fall of the index today had to do with continued investor worries that fourth quarter earnings, especially for bank and finance firms, would be poor.</p>
<p>Banks are to submit their balance sheets to the Bank of Thailand late this month. Investors usually assess banks' performance after they have submitted the balance sheets.</p>
<p>The finance sector dropped the most on Tuesday, falling 4.34 percent. The banking sector declined 2.34 percent. Bangkok Bank topped the active list, falling three baht to 182. National Finance dipped 1.75 to 44.50. -- Suthep Chawla (662) 652-0642</p>
