<p>Sporting goods retailer Forzani Group Ltd was unlikely to show much improvement this fiscal year from last year's loss after reporting deep third-quarter losses on Thursday, chief financial officer Hammie Hill said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it would be very difficult for us to improve our performance over the prior year at the year end,&quot; Hill told Reuters in a phone interview &quot;I think where we will see an improvement is in the fourth quarter alone.&quot;</p>
<p>Forzani lost C$0.66 a share in the previous fiscal year ended January 28. Its third-quarter losses rose to C$0.99 a share from year earlier C$0.36. The quarter ended October 27.  </p>
<p>Forzani shares dropped 0.75 to a year low of 1.75 in light trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>But November sales increased from the previous few months, demonstrating that the holiday sales season would be better than last year's dismal performance, Hill said.</p>
<p>&quot;Considering last year was bad, we don't expect a great Christmas, although (we see) a bit of improvement,&quot; Hill added.</p>
<p>Forzani's third quarter was hit by the cost of clearing excess inventory after poor sales during an unseasonably cold spring and summer.  </p>
<p>But gross margins were more robust than a year earlier, since stores now carried less inventory, Hill said.</p>
