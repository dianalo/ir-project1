<title>USA: NYMEX Palo Verde electricity up, off morning highs.</title>
<headline>NYMEX Palo Verde electricity up, off morning highs.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-17</dateline>

<p>NYMEX Palo Verde electricity futures were trading up but off morning highs on strength from expectations of air conditioning demand in the U.S. Southwest, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Psychologically, (warm Southwest weather) is having an impact because people are starting to say 'let's get ready for the warm (summer) blast,'&quot; one New York-based futures trader said.</p>
<p>As of 1200 EDT, May Palo Verde (PV) was trading 40 cents higher at $16.85 per megawatt hour (MWh) after trade as high as $17.50, while June was up 40 cents at $17.90 after reaching as high as $18.25 per MWh.</p>
<p>September PV was up 15 cents at $23.00 after exchange as low as $22.70 per MWh.</p>
<p>May California Oregon Border (COB) was down nine cents at $12.90 after reaching as high as $13.40, while June was steady at $12.55 per MWh.</p>
<p>The retrenchment from morning highs was typical of electricity futures trade over the past several days, under which the contracts move to highs then back off but close above previous settlements, the futures trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen (traders) blow it up and then bring it back down recently,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Strength in the power futures market was also seen drawing some upward momentum from natural gas futures.</p>
<p>As of 1200 EDT, May NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were up six cents at $2.065 per million British thermal units, following behind stronger physical gas prices.</p>
<p>But warm weather and expected cooling demand in the Southwest was the primary driver behind the rise in power futures, the sources said.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the Southwest were forecast to average three to 15 degrees Fahrenheit above normal through Sunday, with the greatest departures from normal expected across Nevada, Utah and Colorado.</p>
<p>Southwest temperatures were expected to return to more normal levels early next week with little or no precipitation through Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, temperatures were expected to be four to 10 degrees above normal through early next week under clouds, rain and high mountain snows Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>NYMEX said that as of 1145 EDT, an estimated total of 21 COB and 535 PV contracts had sold.</p>
<p>In California, the 1,080 megawatt (MW) San Onofre 3 nuclear power unit remained shut for refueling and maintenance, with an expected restart date near mid-June.</p>
<p>The 1,158 MW WNP-2 nuclear plant in Washington state was also shut for refueling, and was expected to resume power output in early July.</p>
<p>Over 10 coal, fuel and hydroelectric generation units were also said to be out of service in the West for unplanned repair work or spring maintenance.</p>
<p>Also, the 1,087 MW Diablo Canyon nuclear unit 1 in California was expected to begin a refueling outage on April 19 which was seen lasting about two months.</p>
