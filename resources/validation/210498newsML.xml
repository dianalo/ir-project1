<p>Britain urged Belarus on Friday not to fall back into &quot;the politics of confrontation&quot; after opponents in the former Soviet republic compromised over a controversial weekend referendum.</p>
<p>&quot;The compromise which seems to have been agreed is obviously a first step in defusing the tension but there's a way still to go,&quot; said a Foreign Office spokesman.</p>
<p>Earlier in Minsk, opponents signed a deal to resolve the standoff between President Alexander Lukashenko and parliament.</p>
<p>Lukashenko agreed that results of Sunday's referendum extending his presidential powers would not be binding. In return, parliament would not try to impeach him.</p>
<p>Russia has welcomed the deal but many in the West regard Lukashenko as a maverick and have effectively backed the parliament, where critics accuse him of dictatorial tendencies.</p>
<p>Friday's deal had done little to change that.</p>
<p>In line with plans it set before the deal, Foreign Office Permanent Under Secretary Sir John Coles met Belarussian ambassador Vladzimir Shchasny to voice Britain's worries.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir John set out our concerns at the deteriotiating situation in the run-up to the referendum and also drew attention to what we see as serious irregularities in the run-up to the referendum,&quot; said a spokesman.</p>
<p>&quot;He said we hoped there would be no reversion to the politics of confrontation and said we would pay close attention to further developments.&quot;</p>
<p>The Belarussian ambassador called the meeting cordial, even though diplomatic sources said it was quite rare for an envoy to be summoned in for a dressing-down.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr John Coles stressed the concerns of the United Kingdom and at the same time expressed hope that recent developments in Belarus will improve the situation,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Shchasny said trade ties with the European Union were also discussed at the meeting but refused to divulge details.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Foreign Office spokesman said events over the weekend could affect EU talks on Monday, when members who have not signed up to the idea of closer trade ties with Minsk &quot;will probably pause before doing so to wait and see how things go&quot;.</p>
