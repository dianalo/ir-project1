<title>USA: South Carolina executes man for 1983 murders.</title>
<headline>South Carolina executes man for 1983 murders.</headline>

<p>A man convicted of the murders of a South Carolina couple in 1983 was executed by lethal injection early on Friday, the fifth person to be executed by the state this year.</p>
<p>The execution of Cecil Lucas, 41, took place at Columbia's Broad River Correctional Institution at 1:28 a.m. EDT (0628 GMT), prison spokesman John Barkley said.</p>
<p>Lucas was the third South Carolina death row inmate this year to drop his appeals and ask to be executed. According to court documents Lucas, who had spent 13 years on Death Row, halted his appeals because he did not want to spend another 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>One person was executed in South Carolina in 1995 and only four others were executed in the previous 10 years. The last time five inmates were executed in one year in the state was in 1961. In 1947, the state executed 13, the most ever in a single year.</p>
<p>Officials have scheduled the execution of Frank Middleton, 33, a convicted rapist and murderer, for next Friday.</p>
<p>As many as 75 executions are expected to occur in the United States in 1996, topping last year's total of 56, a figure that was the highest so far since capital punishment returned to the country in 1977.</p>
<p>The death penalty was banned in the United States by the Supreme Court in 1972, but only four years later, the court ruled states could resume it -- and most promptly did.</p>
