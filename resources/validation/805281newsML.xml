<p>Polish shares extended Thursday's fall, dropping 2.9 percent, and analysts saw another dip on Tuesday as the market fell in profit-taking after its recent 14.5-percent, six-session surge.</p>
<p>Analysts said some smaller investors may have been unnerved by the Dow's plunge on Friday when the Polish bourse was closed for a holiday but that current falls should prove restrained.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a correction simply...turnovers are twice as low as they were a week ago,&quot; said Bogdan Kornacki, a trader at Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy (WBK) brokerage.</p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index fell 2.9 percent to to 16,428.7 points and turnover eased 5.1 percent to 159.4 million zlotys ($45.9 million) on all three markets. Losers led gainers by 97 to six with 11 stocks flat.</p>
<p>Analysts said Polish shares still looked relatively cheap compared to neighbouring bourses such as Hungary's which saw sustained gains this year as Poland faltered.</p>
<p>But they said uncertainty in the run-up to the September 21 parliamentary elections and the exhausted surge by large-cap banks should limit the market's upside as well.</p>
<p>Large-cap stocks such as aluminium firm Kety, bank WBK and steel trader Stalexport fell sharply in profit-taking in light to moderate trade after recent surges.</p>
<p>Analysts said Monday's loss leader, metals trader Impexmetal down 9.9 percent in light trade, was hurt by Thursday's news of a significantly lower July net profit.</p>
<p>They said stocks could be affected on Tuesday by the release by most firms of July earnings data after Monday's session.</p>
