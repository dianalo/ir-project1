<headline>Romania hails oil block tender as success.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1996-12-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Romania's National Agency for Mineral Resources (ANRM) said on Wednesday it had received eight &quot;block-offers&quot; from companies bidding in a tender for 15 onshore and offshore oil blocks.</p>
<p>&quot;We can say the tender was a success. We received eight block-offers for areas which are geologically interesting,&quot; Doru Badulescu, head of ANRM, told a news conference.</p>
<p>In April, ANRM put up for tender nine prospective oil blocks chain-linked along the eastern rim of the Carpathians, two near the northern border with Hungary and Ukraine, two in southern Romania and two on the Black Sea continental shelf.</p>
<p>ANMR sources said 47 companies had bought packages of data on the 15 blocks on offer.</p>
<p>Badulescu declined to identify the company or companies which submitted offers, or elaborate on &quot;block-offers&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;At this stage everything is confidential,&quot; Badulescu said, adding that the ANRM had set a January 31 deadline to evaluate the offers. Winning bidders would be able to start work on the blocks by next June.</p>
<p>Badulescu said the blocks chosen by the bidding companies covered &quot;interesting and complex geological areas&quot;.</p>
<p>Romania needs capital and modern technology to discover oil deposits in deep or difficult structures. Local oil companies can drill only to depths of 4,000 metres.</p>
<p>Agency sources said potential winners in the tender would invest a minimum $30 million and be able to drill at depths exceeding 4,000 metres. Technology transfer and training programmes were additional assets.</p>
<p>A Western oil expert was reluctant to describe the tender as a success but told Reuters it was a positive step to attract major investors to Romania's oil sector.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very unclear what those eight block-offers mean but its better than no offers at all,&quot; the expert said. &quot;The fact that they got offers at all is positive and could send encouraging signs to strategic investors.&quot;</p>
<p>Seeking an increase in oil output in 1991, Romania offered concessions to firms including Royal/Dutch Shell Group, Enterprise Oil Plc and Amoco Corp.</p>
<p>Romania is a mature oil and gas producing region. But frenzied exploitation of reserves by the former communists and poor equipment depressed crude output over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>Crude production was around 6.7 million tonnes (equivalent to about 134,000 barrels per day) last year, compared to a peak of 14.7 million tonnes (294,000 bpd) in 1986.</p>
<p>Under a new petroleum law, Romania puts local and foreign investors on an equal footing. The law covers concessions, taxes and royalties and includes a one-year profit tax exemption following the start-up of production. --Adrian Dascalu, Bucharest newsroom +401 312-0264</p>
