<p>The main association of Germany's commercial banks said on Monday it expects economic growth of &quot;a good one percent&quot; this year to be followed in 1997 by a rebound in exports, driven by a positive world economy.</p>
<p>Moderate exchange rates, low inflation and low interest rates should help strengthen German exports next year, said Karl-Heinz Wessel, president of the Federeration of German Banks, told reporters in Bonn.</p>
<p>The association, whose members include Germany's big three Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank, said the economy would grow 1.5 percent to two percent next year.</p>
<p>However, he added any recovery would be limited without increased business investment.</p>
<p>&quot;A jump start from the investment motor is still not in sight,&quot; he said. &quot;Without the support of the investment side, the economic recovery can lose power quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said he saw little relief for Germany's eastern region and its growing unemployment, which reached a seasonally-adjusted post-unification high of four million in October.</p>
<p>Next year's turnaround will not be strong enough to significantly cut unemployment, Wessel said.</p>
<p>The eastern part of Germany will also continue lagging due to the slump in its construction sector, he said.</p>
<p>These negative factors reflect structural weaknesses in the German economy that should be corrected through strict control of federal and state budget deficits, he said, adding that new union contracts were key to reducing unemployment.</p>
