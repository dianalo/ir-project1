<p>Russia's new young government, knuckling down to painful market reforms, will knock on the doors of some of the world's elite economic clubs this week seeking compensation for NATO expansion.</p>
<p>Faced with a critical budget crisis caused partly by widespread tax evasion, the cabinet plans to present parliament with a programme of spending cuts early this week and get tough on debtors at home and abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;The government's position is, debt restructuring -- yes, payment of property for debt -- yes, debt forgiveness -- categorically no,&quot; First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais told reporters on his way to the United States on Sunday.</p>
<p>Chubais, 41, who leads the reformist team appointed last month to try to kick-start stalled economic reforms, travelled to Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in combative mood.</p>
<p>In the most overt linkage yet by a Russian official between NATO expansion and economic concessions Moscow is hoping to win from the West, Chubais said the NATO plan was a &quot;pointless and dangerous attempt to isolate Russia from the civilised world.</p>
<p>&quot;To stop that danger materialising, we are obliged to work out with the respective leaders, including those of the United States, mechanisms to compensate for that danger and loss Russia will suffer on the world political arena from NATO expansion,&quot; said Chubais, quoted by Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>Chubais said he would discuss two loans with the World Bank and press Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organisation and Paris Club of government creditors as a quid quo pro for NATO's plans to take in former Soviet-bloc states.</p>
<p>The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is expected, at a summit in Madrid in July, to invite Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to begin entry talks.</p>
<p>Russia is fiercely opposed, saying the alliance's expansion into its former sphere of influence threatens its security.</p>
<p>NATO and Russian officials are urgently negotiating a treaty on relations between the two sides aimed at appeasing Moscow's fears but Russia also wants compensation on the economic front.</p>
<p>Chubais, who hopes membership of the Paris Club will help Russia recover funds lent by the Soviet Union under communism to Third World states, said he would get tough with some of the debtors when he meets their finance ministers in Washington.</p>
<p>Russia could get back around $300-500 million a year from around 27 debtor nations, Interfax quoted Chubais as saying on the plane on his way to the United States.</p>
<p>Once back in Russia later this week, he plans to turn his attention to firms owing taxes, starting by cracking the whip over &quot;debtor number one&quot; car manufacurer AvtoVAZ.</p>
<p>On Sunday a big defence plant in the Yaroslav region north of Moscow was declared officially bankrupt, a further sign of a new push towards economic restructuring after a long drift.</p>
<p>Chubais said the government would present its budget cutting plan to the communist-dominated parliament on Monday or Tuesday and was prepared for compromise with deputies, many of whom have said they will fight a squeeze on social spending.</p>
<p>&quot;Cutting the budget will strike a strong blow against corruption,&quot; he said. &quot;The situation where budget revenues are only 56 percent of planned levels allows unlimited room to manoevre funds on all levels,&quot; Interfax quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Chubais denied that he and the other new First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemstov, 37, who was appointed oil and gas minister last week, were at odds with longtime Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, 59, who used to run the gas industry.</p>
<p>All three of them had the same approach to restructuring gas, electricity and railways monopolies, Chubais said.</p>
<p>&quot;I categorically disagree with those who describe what is going on in the government as a tug-of-war between the 'elderly' Chernomyrdin and the 'young' Chubais and Nemtsov. Without Chernomyrdin we would not be in the government,&quot; Chubais said.</p>
