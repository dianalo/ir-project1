<p>Turkish Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan backed an army plan to sack scores of Islamist soldiers after months of military pressure that has brought his coalition government close to breaking point, newspapers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Milliyet daily said Erbakan signed documents approving the dishonourable discharge of 161 officers and non-commissioned officers at a meeting of the Supreme Military Council on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Ninety percent of the expulsions were for fundamentalism and the rest for extreme leftist activities,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Other papers carried similar reports from a marathon closed-door meeting of the Supreme Military Council, grouping the secularist top generals and the prime minister.</p>
<p>Army pressure on Erbakan to curb a rise in Islamist sentiment has exposed serious cracks in the coalition government.</p>
<p>The cabinet was set to meet for the first time in eight weeks at 1700 (1400 GMT) on Tuesday, a spokesman at Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's office told Reuters.</p>
<p>A scheduled ministers' meeting was postponed last week amid reports Ciller had demanded Erbakan hand over power to her to prevent the government collapsing.</p>
<p>Four anti-Islamist MPs from Ciller's True Path Party have resigned in recent days, reducing the government's majority on paper to only one, although vacant seats give it a larger margin.</p>
<p>Milliyet said the generals overruled an attempt by Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist prime minister, to postpone a decision on the expulsions until August.</p>
<p>The top brass warned that the small Islamist press was attacking secularists and setting them up as targets for Islamist violence, the paper said. &quot;They gave Erbakan a caution about these publications,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The generals have demanded restrictions on the growing Islamist media as part of a planned return to the strict secularism of the 1920s when republican Turkey was forged out of the ashes of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>Erbakan has so far stalled on army anti-Islamist directives, including plans to cut religious education and enforce bans on Islamic dress.</p>
