<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates closed down 110 basis points to 18.30 percent on Monday, their lowest rate since the peso devaluation crisis of December 1994.</p>
<p>Traders said rates fell due to ample market liquidity, despite the fact that U.S. investors were absent from the market due to Presidents Day.  </p>
<p>&quot;Although we were expecting a slow session due to the absence of U.S. dealers, the market was awash in liquidity again,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;A stable peso and the outlook for lower inflation still seem to be driving rates down,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Benchmark 48-hour peso contracts closed 2.5 centavos softer at 7.7930/7.7960 per dollar.</p>
<p>Lower secondary rates led several dealers to forecast falls of up to 100 basis points in bellwether 28-day Cetes rates at Tuesday's primary central bank auction. This would also take benchmark interest rates down to their lowest level since the 1994 crisis.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile fell 25 basis points to 20.35 percent.</p>
<p>A sign of surplus market liquidity was central bank participation in the session, where it drained 1.154 billion pesos from the system.</p>
<p>Liquidity of 204 million pesos was scheduled to return to the system on Tuesday. Nonetheless, traders said government spending estimated at three billion pesos would increase liquidity considerably.</p>
