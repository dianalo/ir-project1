<p>French luxury goods flagship LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton said on Thursday its profit rose in the first half of 1996 but the struggle to keep its prestigious perfumes off the grey market drove down operating income.</p>
<p>The group said profit excluding exceptional items climbed 5.4 percent to 1.54 billion francs ($299.3 million) on sales of 13.37 billion, but operating income fell more than 10 percent to 2.61 billion francs in the first half.</p>
<p>The fall was due to a slump in operating income of the perfumes division to 70 million francs from 380 million as the group battled to keep Christian Dior perfumes out of the gray market which supplies discount outlets via independent distributors.</p>
<p>Investors, disappointed by the mixed results at one of France's most successful companies, hammered LVMH's stock. It closed 3.9 percent lower at 1,058 francs after having fallen 2.8 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The company, whose brands range from Pommery champagnes to Hennessy cognacs and Louis Vuitton luggage, said operating income in its luxury leather goods, cognac and champagne divisions rose in the first half.</p>
<p>Cognac sales stabilised in Japan after a long decline, luggage sales were brisk in the summer and champagne sales were raised by recent price increases.</p>
<p>The company said the perfume division's results should improve in the second half of the year, helped by the launches of the Givenchy perfume Organza, Champs-Elysees from Guerlain and Magic from Celine.</p>
<p>It has campaigned against grey market sales by being more selective in supplying distributors to tighten control over selling prices and protect its fat profit margins.</p>
<p>LVMH said it maintained its objective for sales and profit growth for the full year, but several analysts said they would reduce their 1996 and 1997 profit forecasts for the group.</p>
<p>Cedric Magnelia at investment bank CS First Boston said he would lower his 1996 earnings estimate from 4.4 billion francs to close to last year's profit excluding exceptionals of 4.05 billion.</p>
<p>Analyst Sylvain Massot at Morgan Stanley said he was cutting his 1996 profit growth estimate to five percent from 10 percent and would trim his 1997 forecast to show growth of about seven percent, instead of 10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Previously we had a letdown with the (sales) volumes. Now it's the margins that are disappointing despite currency hedging,&quot; Massot told Reuters.</p>
<p>The company's results have been pressured recently by weak consumer spending in France and Germany, sluggish sales in Japan, one of its biggest markets, and the adverse effects of the franc's strength against other currencies.</p>
<p>Massot said the solid first-half performance of the luggage and drinks divisions was largely due to the company's shrewd currency hedging which will not cover next year's results. ($1=5.145 French Franc)</p>
