<p>Centrica Plc executive Brian Murphy warned on Tuesday there could be calls to delay the next phase of trials for UK household gas market competition unless lessons are learned from earlier phases including that suppliers should act reponsibly when door-step selling.</p>
<p>Murphy, director of customer operations for British Gas Trading, told a conference it was clear that some suppliers were better prepared than others, adding that, &quot;This industry succeeded in making (switching suppliers) a demanding and stressful process for many customers in the south west (England) trial area, and a costly business for many in the companies involved.&quot;</p>
<p>He said British Gas, the former monopoly UK gas supplier from which Centrica was spun off this year, undertook extra work in phase one and incurred extra costs &quot;in order to help others out of a predicament.&quot;</p>
<p>British Gas has now stopped this, and the industry would now be able to establish the extent of the problems and costs, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is essential in establishing the robustness of the process in order that any changes can be agreed and made before the further roll-out of competition.&quot;</p>
<p>The former British Gas has lost about 85,000 customers in the south west pilot, he added.</p>
<p>He said the opening of electricity and gas markets should be phased to a similar timetable.</p>
<p>But he said his chief concern remained the need for &quot;effective ownership of the end-to-end process&quot;, and he was &quot;pleased to see that Ofgas are beginning to take a significant role in this area.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Phase one was developed and implemented with neither a formal programme manager nor any obvious sign of comprehensive ongoing risk assessment and mitigation. Phase two has opened with the same glaring omissions,&quot; he said, but added that there were now signs of activity in this area.</p>
<p>Ofgas, the UK gas market regulator, had he said taken the initiative to carry out an in-depth review of the options for the extension of competition and the associated risks.</p>
