<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-09-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch shares closed mixed on Wednesday, spiralling off from midday highs after news of fresh Iraq/U.S. tensions and a profit warning from Motorola which looked set to send Wall Street lower at its opening.</p>
<p>Shares climbed at the outset on the firmer dollar, led later by gains in cyclicals and a strong rise in heavily weighted Philips, responding to positive semiconductor industry figures for August out of the U.S. late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The AEX share index closed 0.19 points off at 562.07, having first risen to a session high of 565.51, before dipping to a low on the day of 559.56 after the Iraq and Motorola news.  </p>
<p>Dealers said news Iraqi forces fired one or two missiles at U.S. warplanes flying over northern Iraq caused a knee-jerk retreat from the highs but the market quickly regained its composure as the incident was seen as relatively minor.</p>
<p>&quot;The Iraq thing gave some downward pressure on the market but it didn't look like it had that much impact,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>A dip on news U.S. semiconductor and telecoms equipment Motorola said its third quarter earnings could lag those of the second quarter proved equally temporary. Market watchers had anticipated Wall Street would lurch lower on the warning but in the event the U.S. market had a fairly tame early session.  </p>
<p>Philips, which closed 70 cents higher at 56.20, had earlier ridden to a day's peak of 57.10 guilders -- boosted by news late yesterday of a positive August book-to-bill ratio.</p>
<p>&quot;Philips has been disappointing for quite a while so people were reminded of the value in the stock by the book-to-bill number,&quot; said one dealer. The ratio, which measures new orders against shipments, rose to 0.90 in August from 0.86 in July.</p>
<p>The shares tailed off on worries about industry trends raised by the Motorola profit warning, although these were alleviated later by the U.S. company's prediction that the semiconductor industry would return to a &quot;growth mode&quot; in 1997.  </p>
<p>Akzo and DSM closed with pared gains, rising strongly at the opening as the market re-examined the cyclicals sector following recent remarks by Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer that second quarter data pointed to a cyclical upturn in Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Tietmeyer's remarks that cyclical businesses are picking up was moving Akzo and DSM,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>Akzo closed 1.70 guilders higher at 192.90, while fellow chemicals producer DSM finished 2.60 guilders up at 160.50, back from a session high of 163.20. Metals business Hoogovens also latched onto the wave of interest in cyclicals, finishing 60 cents higher at 62.00 guilders.  </p>
<p>Financials were under the weather with ING down 70 cents to 51.50 guilders and ABN AMRO off 20 cents to 91.80 guilders.</p>
<p>Other leaders saw Royal Dutch up 1.20 guilders to 260.70 and Unilever 0.50 guilders up at 254.20. -- Keiron Henderson, Amsterdam Newsroom +31 20 504 5000</p>
