<title>THAILAND: Thailand to institutionalise currency controls.</title>
<headline>Thailand to institutionalise currency controls.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-06-11</dateline>

<p>Thailand is working on measures to permanently institutionalise recent capital controls to fend off future speculative attacks on the Thai baht, a senior Bank of Thailand official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The move is set to widen the gap for the baht in the offshore and onshore markets, the official told Reuters. But he did not provide a time frame for when the formalisation of the controls would take place.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are working on permanent measures which will institutionalise existing controls and more,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;(The measures,) if anything, will widen the existing differentials between onshore and offshore baht,&quot; he said, adding that there would be no convergence of the two markets.</p>
<p>&quot;We aim to keep a tight rein on the currency. Genuine capital flows for investment will not be affected. We are only clamping down on speculators in the baht with these measures,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The central bank launched currency control measures in mid-May after the latest speculative attack on the baht.</p>
<p>It cut off baht supply to foreign speculators from local sources and the action created an informal two-tier baht market -- one offshore and the other onshore.</p>
<p>The baht has been trading at around 13-year highs against the dollar in the offshore market given strong demand from foreign players in need of baht funds to cover short positions taken during the speculative attack last month.</p>
<p>The differential between the value of the baht offshore and onshore has been wide.</p>
<p>The central bank official's remarks matched comments made by Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan earlier on Wednesday, but there were also contrasts.</p>
<p>Amnuay said more permanent currency control measures would be announced soon but added that he expected the wide spread between the onshore and offshore baht values to narrow when the situation normalised.</p>
<p>The central bank official had said this would not be the case.</p>
<p>Analysts have speculated that the central bank will impose capital controls, similar to those used by South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, before another attack on the baht arrived.</p>
