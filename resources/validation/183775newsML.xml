<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on Tuesday the Middle East will only benefit from economic integration after there is peace in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;Our economies have grown closer... yet this is not close enough, for as long as comprehensive peace on all tracks is not firmly and irreversibly established among us, we will not reap the full benefits of our economic integration,&quot; Mubarak said.</p>
<p>He was addressing the opening session of the third Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference in which businessmen and officials from 92 countries are taking part.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope this conference will help bring about an era of economic cooperation which will see the full utilisation of resources, but this needs a full and balanced peace,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The conference was originally aimed at integrating Israel in the region's economy but the May election of right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has changed its purpose.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's refusal to trade occupied Arab lands for peace -- a basic principle of a 1991 accord signed in Madrid -- has slowed the peace talks considerably.</p>
<p>He is also trying to renegotiate an Israeli troop redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron for security reasons. The Arabs and Palestinians refuse point blank any changes to the 1993 agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us build a peace that is just, build a prosperity that is for all,&quot; Mubarak told the conference, which Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy is also attending.</p>
<p>&quot;For it shall be said, centuries from today, that our countries had peace within their grasp and squandered it.&quot;</p>
<p>The conference opened amid a flurry of diplomatic activity on the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>Mubarak met Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and held talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.</p>
<p>Arafat and Christopher met on Monday night, but U.S. state department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the meeting had not made any progress on the American-sponsored peace process.</p>
