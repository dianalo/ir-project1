<p>Heavy rains were expected in central Illinois Wednesday, compounding flooding problems on the Illinois and Rock rivers, meteorologists said.</p>
<p>&quot;We do have another rain storm moving in and it looks like it's taking aim right at the Illinois River,&quot; said Joel Burgio, meteorologist with Weather Services Corp. &quot;We're projecting 0.50 to 2.00 inches with locally heavier. The heaviest rainfall will be between Peoria and Springfield.&quot;</p>
<p>Freese-Notis meteorologist Craig Solberg said central Illinois can expect up to two inches of rain in the next 24 to 36 hours.  </p>
<p>&quot;It (flooding potential) looks pretty severe,&quot; Solberg said. &quot;The weather pattern looks active for the next 10 days with above-normal rainfall expected.&quot;</p>
<p>Burgio said runoff can be more severe at this time of year because there is less vegetation to soak up ground moisture and cold temperatures limit evaporation.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost all of the rain that falls goes into the rivers,&quot; Burgio said. &quot;In the summertime a good portion of it is either absorbed into the soils and used by the vegetation or evaporated because of the hotter temperatures.&quot;  </p>
<p>Mid-range forecasts suggested storms would move across Illinois about every third day, said Fred Gesser, chief forecaster with Weather Express Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;The models show another storm system Saturday, bringing another 0.50 to 2.00 inches of precipitation to Illinois,&quot; Gesser said. &quot;It looks like it will be in the form of rain.&quot;</p>
<p>He added, &quot;Temperatures are going to be mild enough with these systems that where there is snow, it's going to be melting. It's (flooding) going to be worse before it gets better.&quot;</p>
<p>National Weather Service's six- to 10-day outlook updated Tuesday predicted above-normal temperatures for Illinois with above-normal precipitation in the eastern half of the state.</p>
