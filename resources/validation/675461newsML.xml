<p>Britain's new opposition leader William Hague on Friday began the task of reuniting his battered Conservative party by appointing four of his rivals to key posts in his shadow cabinet.</p>
<p>Hague, keen to heal the splits which helped sink the party at the May 1 election, held out an olive branch to the four right-wingers, three of whom challenged him for the leadership of the party. All four took what was on offer.</p>
<p>The most important acceptance was that of right-winger John Redwood, who clashed with Hague during the leadership race but has now evidently decided to bury his pride and accept the job of shadow trade and industry secretary.</p>
<p>&quot;He asked me to do a senior job in the shadow cabinet (and) it would be churlish to refuse. We must put the interests of the party first and so I'm doing it for the sake of party unity and so that I can work hard for the team,&quot; Redwood told BBC radio.</p>
<p>&quot;The party has made its decision about who is the leader and it's now the job of all of us to get behind the leader and to help him when he asks.&quot;</p>
<p>Peter Lilley and Michael Howard will respectively become shadow finance and foreign affairs spokesmen while Stephen Dorrell -- who quit the leadership race before the first ballot -- will become shadow education and employment secretary.</p>
<p>Conservative sources had originally said Dorrell would become shadow environment spokesman.</p>
<p>But there was no job for former chancellor of the exchequer Kenneth Clarke, the pro-European who lost to Hague in the final round of the party leadership race on Thursday. He had made clear he was not prepared to serve unless he won.</p>
<p>The appointments strengthened the strong right-wing flavour of the party's new leadership, since all four shadow ministers belonged to the so-called Eurosceptic wing of the party which opposes further integration with the European Union.</p>
<p>Hague had earlier surprised everyone by appointing veteran politician Cecil Parkinson to the job of Conservative chairman -- a post crucial to rebuilding the party's grass roots support after the crushing election defeat by Labour.</p>
<p>Officials later said Hague planned to travel on Saturday to Scotland, a part of the country which did not elect a single Conservative member of parliament on May 1.</p>
<p>After presenting Parkinson to applauding workers at the party's London headquarters, Hague said: &quot;He is going to be taking on this role to put the party into new fighting shape...</p>
<p>&quot;I think he will combine the youth of the new leadership with the experience of politics for many years and bring great heart to the Conservative party across the country.&quot;</p>
<p>Parkinson -- a close ally of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher -- made clear his appointment as party chairman was only for around two years while he helped Hague rebuild Conservative support.</p>
<p>Parkinson was party chairman more than 14 years ago, playing a key role in Thatcher's 1983 election victory.</p>
<p>But just months later he quit the cabinet in a blaze of publicity after making his secretary pregnant. He returned to the cabinet four years later but the scandal dogged him.</p>
