<p>Lebanon's construction industry stagnated in 1996 with the number of construction permits issued falling by 60.2 percent compared with 1995 and cement deliveries dropping 4.4 percent, Banque Audi said in its latest economic report issued on Monday.</p>
<p>Construction permits were issued for 13.14 million square metres compared with 33.06 million in 1995 and cement deliveries fell to 3,802,433 tonnes from 3,977,794 tonnes in 1995, the bank said in its report for the final quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The decline in the building sector reflects that in private investment which, according to our estimates, suffered a severe decline of 14 percent in 1966 when compared with 1995,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It cited general economic sluggishness and &quot;the precarious state of the Lebanese mortgage market and the absence of any organised form of housing loans&quot; for the decline.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time, very high real interest rates on the pound, affecting assets, reduce investments and increase financial savings, and as an indirect consequence reduce purchases,&quot; the report added.</p>
<p>However, it said the industry's prospects were not worrying when comparing the unsold stock with the annual need for housing units over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand has been helped considerably by the launch of housing loan programmes by several banks in 1996,&quot; it added.</p>
