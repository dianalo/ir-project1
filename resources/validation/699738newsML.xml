<p>The dollar may soon account for half of all international bond issuance after a strong performance in the first half of the year, bankers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar has regained its momentum and has become the major currency for issuance and the main currency investors want to buy,&quot; said Takeo Sumino, associate director of debt syndicate at Nomura International.</p>
<p>International bond issuance just topped $400 billion in the first half of the year, up 13.4 percent on the same period in 1996, Capital DATA Bondware said.</p>
<p>Dollars took a 48 percent share of issuance, compared with 40 percent in the first six months of 1996.</p>
<p>Bankers said this reflected the strength of the dollar in the currency market and the higher yields available there, in turn a consequence of the booming U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The dollar has been rallying against the mark for the last two years, rising to the 1.75 marks area from an all-time low at 1.38 marks in May 1995.</p>
<p>The yield spread between 10-year German and U.S. government bonds was about 90 basis points. A year ago, yields were reversed, with Germany offering about 35 b.p. more than U.S. bonds.</p>
<p>At the same time uncertainty about preparations for European economic and monetary union (EMU) have contributed to a shift away from European currencies towards the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;The major European currencies are less appealing because of low interest rates and uncertainty about the future of the single currency,&quot; Sumino at Nomura said.</p>
<p>Issuance of mark-denominated Eurobonds fell by 19.7 percent in the first half of 1997 relative to the same period last year, to $50 billion equivalent.</p>
<p>Guilders and French francs were also less active.</p>
<p>Yields in Europe have continued to converge, reducing the incentive for investors to take on currency risk in an effort to boost portfolio returns.</p>
<p>&quot;Convergence means there is not enough arbitrage to justify taking currency risk, there is not enough yield pick-up,&quot; a syndicate manager at SBC Warburg said. &quot;People buy at home, or they buy dollars. The dollar has become the currency for Europe in the last six months.&quot;</p>
<p>As the search for yield continues, European investors have become bigger buyers of corporate bonds.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1997 companies raised $68 billion in the international bond markets, compared with $56 billion in the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The types of borrowers coming to the market are evolving quite dramatically,&quot; David Tory, head of syndicate at Merrill Lynch said.</p>
<p>&quot;U.S. single-A rated corporates, for example, are successfully coming to the market in big size in a way they have not been able to do before,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Investors are increasingly focusing on credit in anticipation of the introduction of the single currency in 1999, when it will no longer be possible to make money with currency plays.</p>
<p>As part of this trend, the first high-yielding corporate bonds, or junk bonds, were launched in European currencies this year. So far marks, sterling and French francs have been tapped, and this market is expected to develop further.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rates are lower, supply of sovereign paper has gone down, and people are waking up (to the fact) that there are good credits which offer tremendous value without taking on much more risk,&quot; Tory at Merrill Lynch said.</p>
<p>&quot;European investors are revising their guidelines. Historically they have been able to buy just double-A rated paper, now this is single-A and over the next 18 months they may go down to treble-B,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The SBC Warburg official said: &quot;In the coming months there will be less and less bank paper, and more corporate paper launched. The semi-junk bonds issued in Europe have all gone very well.&quot;</p>
<p>Demand for emerging market debt has also boomed, with the sector raising $58 billion in the first half of the year, nearly double the amount issued in the first six months of 1996.</p>
