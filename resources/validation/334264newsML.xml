<p>Ingersoll-Rand Co said on Monday it was making a recommended cash offer for British building products group Newman Tonks Group Plc, valuing the firm at about 230 million pounds ($376 million).</p>
<p>Ingersoll-Rand is offering 175 pence a share in cash for Newman, which is fighting a hostile bid from British engineering group FKI Plc. Ingersoll said its offer, which came with a forecast dividend of 4.4 pence, represented a premium of 28.1 percent over FKI's bid launched in December.  </p>
<p>Ingersoll said its offer, including the 4.4 pence Newman Tonks forecast dividend, would give shareholders a total of 179.4 pence per share.</p>
<p>The U.S. engineering firm said its bid had the unanimous backing of the Newman Tonks board.</p>
<p>Newman Tonks chairman Christopher Hughes said, &quot;The cash offer from Ingersoll-Rand represents a premium of 28 percent over the cash alternative value of FKI's unsolicited and hostile offer.&quot;</p>
<p>Newman also said it expected profits before tax, exceptional items and bid costs for the year to December 31 1996 would be not less than 18.0 million pounds ($29.42 million), up 5.3 percent on the previous year. It expected to pay a dividend of 4.4 pence for the year.</p>
<p>FKI mounted its 195.7 million pound hostile bid for Newman in December, which Newman told shareholders to reject.</p>
<p>Separately on Monday, FKI said it had acceptances for its offer of some 20.6 percent of Newman Tonks shares, and said it owned or had agreed to buy further shares totalling 0.4 percent. FKI's offer, which was scheduled to close on February 7, has been accepted by fund management groups M&amp;G and Britannic Assurance, who control some 13.37 percent of Newman Tonks shares. ($1=.6119 Pound)</p>
