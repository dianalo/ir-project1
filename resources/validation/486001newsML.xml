<p>Czech shares continued to slide on Thursday in a session dominated by rumours and a strong official denial of heavy 1996 losses at one of the country's biggest banks, IPB a.s .</p>
<p>IPB is due to release audited 1996 results in the next few days and rumours swept the share and bond markets that the bank would post large losses.</p>
<p>At one point IPB had fallen 25 crowns, 7.6 percent, on the bourse to 305 but after a high ranking IPB spokesman told Reuters that the rumours were &quot;nonesense&quot; it recovered to close down just one crown to 329.</p>
<p>&quot;In the morning there was genuine panic as there were several people selling at very low prices in the bond and the share. Then this story came out and said it was a bunch of nonesense,&quot; said John Vax, director of capital markets at ING Barings.</p>
<p>Vax added that most traders would probably wait for the actual results before making further buy or sell decisions.</p>
<p>Overall, the PX50 index fell 6.2 points, 1.12 percent, to 547.2 dragged down by losses to most major issues</p>
<p>SPT Telecom fell 65 crowns, 1.9 percent, to 3,325 while Komercni Banka lost 55 crowns, 2.3 percent, to 2,350.</p>
<p>Traders said the mood in the market had not been helped by the IPB rumours.</p>
<p>However, they added that sentiment was generally bearish anayway because of worse than expected results from some major issues and the long standing problem of inadequate capital market regulation which has frightened away foreign investors.</p>
<p>&quot;We are advising anyone not to enter right now and depending on what they hold, either to hold on and in some scenarios even to sell out,&quot; said Radek Vavra of Citicorp Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very, very, very, quiet..they (traders generally) don't buy definitely...but they don't sell as well which perhaps is the reason why the market did not drop as dramatically as I expected it to do,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Vavra said the decline of the PX50 below 550 was not a partuclarly important psychological barrier in the Czech market.</p>
