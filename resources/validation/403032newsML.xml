<p>China's financial markets paused on Tuesday in a show of respect for Deng Xiaoping, the revolutionary leader who inspired them with his market-style economic reforms.</p>
<p>Trading came to a brief halt on all 14 commodities exchanges as the funeral service for the Communist Party patriarch began in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.</p>
<p>The two stock markets maintained normal trading hours, but brokers said turnover was thin in the morning as many of their customers took time out to watch the nationally televised memorial rites.</p>
<p>On the Beijing Commodity Exchange, traders shut down their computer terminals and stood with heads bowed as a huge electronic screen overhead flashed the words, &quot;Dearly Beloved Comrade Deng Xiaoping, You Will Live Eternally&quot;.</p>
<p>A portrait of Deng was placed in the centre of the trading floor draped in black and yellow ribbons in a sign of mourning.</p>
<p>Deng died last Wednesday, aged 92.</p>
<p>&quot;He was a great man,&quot; said 29-year-old floor trader Qing Wenjin. &quot;It is a great loss for the country.&quot;</p>
<p>Jiang Hui, a trader of green bean futures, said he owed a personal debt to the man whose reforms in 1978 started the opening to the West and let China adopt free market ideas.</p>
<p>&quot;Deng gave the economy direction. I wouldn't be in this business if it weren't for him.&quot;</p>
<p>It was Deng's pragmatic policies that allowed private enterprise and eroded the Stalinist command economy of his predecessor, revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.</p>
<p>Deng's catch-all phrase, &quot;socialism with Chinese characteristics&quot;, permitted all sorts of capitalist-style innovations, from stocks and bonds to pawn shops and night clubs, as long as they created wealth and raised living standards.</p>
<p>In the financial centre of Shanghai, the nation's premier stock exchange remained open as usual, but business was thin.</p>
<p>In southern Shenzhen, one of the special economic zones that Deng used as a laboratory to test his market theories, office workers turned on their televisions to watch Deng's hand-picked successor, President Jiang Zemin, eulogise his political patron.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading was very light,&quot; said a stock trader with Guotai Securities in Shenzhen. &quot;Many offices, including those of some our customers, held special ceremonies to pay their respects.&quot;</p>
<p>Across the street from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, wreaths were propped up at a makeshift shrine where passers-by placed yellow chrysanthemums or bowed in respect.</p>
<p>Many people in Shenzhen, bordering capitalist Hong Kong, had another reason to remember Deng with gratitude.</p>
<p>It was there in 1992 that he launched a tour of southern China, in effect saying this was a model worth copying. His visit, given prominence in the nation's media, was seen as a signal from the very top to go out and make money.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, after their brief pause, traders around the country were getting ready to go back to doing just that.</p>
<p>But in Beijing, futures trader Jiang said he was happy to take time out to show his respect.</p>
<p>&quot;A few minutes of our time wasn't too much to give.&quot;</p>
