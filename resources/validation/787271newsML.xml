<p>A series of price deregulations spurred Czech July consumer inflation to its highest level in a year, but both analysts and the central bank said they expected little fallout from the data since core inflation still appears under control.</p>
<p>The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) released CPI figures on Friday showing that month-on-month inflation for July was 3.5 percent -- the biggest rise since 1993 -- putting the year-on-year rate at 9.4 percent.</p>
<p>July's year-on-year rate is the highest since August 1996, when inflation reached 9.6 percent.</p>
<p>The CSU said liberalisation of rents and energy prices was at the heart of the increase, accounting for 3.252 percent points of the month-on-month figure. Core inflation for July was 0.366 percent, the bureau said.</p>
<p>While the July data was somewhat higher than expected -- a Reuter survey of analysts had predicted a CPI increase of 2.4 percent on average, though estimates among the nine experts canvassed ranged between 1.7-3.8 percent -- most analysts said they did not expect to change their annual forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;Deregulation is responsible for about 90 percent of the July figure...but core inflation played only a minor role in the growth of prices so the result is not so bad,&quot; said Martin Kupka, an economist at Patria Finance.</p>
<p>Jiri Pospisil, a board member of the Czech National Bank said the month-on-month rise in July was slightly higher than the bank's forecast of 3.2 percent, but that the CNB's policy would not change since the rise was due to price deregulation.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that the influence is one-time, and will not have a further influence on the development of prices,&quot; he told the CTK news agency.</p>
<p>&quot;The same as in the past, our approach is the same; in the direction of lowering rates with care not to increase inflationary pressure,&quot; Pospisil added.</p>
<p>Since December, the year-on-year rate steadily dropped from 8.6 percent to a record low of 6.3 percent in May, but in June the trend reversed as the year-on-year rate rose to 6.8 percent.</p>
<p>Housing prices rose 18.9 percent, month-on-month, on the heels of a 50 percent rise in rents for state housing on July 1. Prices in the leisure sector also jumped markedly, rising 5.9 percent, month-on-month.</p>
<p>The CSU said that as of July prices have risen 31.0 percent from the average level for 1994 while the sliding average in July using a 1993 base was 7.9 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the influence of deregulations, and that to the end of the year there are no others planned, inflation for the year should end at between 8-9 percent,&quot; said Jan Urban, an analyst at Union Banka.</p>
<p>At the end of June, the CSU changed its average 1997 inflation forecast to between 8.5 and 9.5 percent from 8.2 to 8.8 percent. It did not say whether the July figures would force further revisions to its estimate.</p>
<p>The Czech crown was little changed on the release of the data. Dealers said a liquidity shortage and market expectations of higher inflation were keeping the currency steady.</p>
<p>At 0850 GMT, the crown was trading at 18.374 to the mark just after the figures were published from 18.486 before the announcement, while the crown/dollar was trading at 34.375 after 34.474 before the data.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically inflation is quite high. The expectation was between 2.0 and 3.5 percent so it's at the upper level of what we expected,&quot; said Breta Tichanek of ING Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking just at inflation you might expect the crown to get weaker...but the market in general it seems is short of Czech crowns,&quot; he added.</p>
