<p>Physicians Resource Group Inc said Wednesday it expects attractive growth in 1997, but will not achieve the previously expected gains from acquisitions.</p>
<p>This will affect its ability to achieve analysts' expectations, the company added.  </p>
<p>Physicians Resource said it closed on a $90 million credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by NationsBank of Tennessee, which replaces an existing $55 million facility with the NationsBank Corp unit.</p>
<p>Borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a pledge of the stock of, and guaranteed by, all subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Interest will be at rates ranging from NationsBank's prime lending rate to prime plus 1.125 percent, or LIBOR plus 1 percent to 2.125 percent, depending on financial ratios.</p>
<p>The company said it has no borrowings outstanding under the facility which provides a three-year revolving credit.  </p>
<p>In addition, the company said chief executive Emmett E. Moore purchased 200,000 convertible preferred shares at $11.125 per share with funds provided by the company in the form of a loan.</p>
<p>Moore has the right to convert the preferred stock into common, at any time, at a one-to-one ratio. This $2.2 million loan is secured by the stock, will bear interest at about 6 percent and will be repayable over a four-year period.</p>
<p>The issuance of the preferred stock will be submitted for approval by stockholders at the next annual meeting in May.  </p>
<p>Summarizing first quarter acquisition efforts, the company said it acquired two eye care practices in addition to the four previously announced. Consideration for the two practices consisted of cash of $160,000 and 329,498 common shares valued at stock prices ranging from $16.6 to $17.5 per share.</p>
<p>About 169,347 of the shares will be restricted as to resale for one year. Total consideration for all six acquisitions made during the quarter was about $10.8 million.</p>
<p>Moore said, &quot;The high level of acquisition activity in the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole ... has exceeded our original practice growth plan for 1996.  </p>
<p>&quot;However, the recent movement of our stock over the latter part of 1996 and early 1997 has created a negative impact on the ability of PRG to maintain that acquisition pace.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, PRG will not achieve the previously expected level of accretiveness from its acquisitions in 1997 and this change in pace and accretiveness may have an impact on PRG's ability to achieve analysts' current expectations in 1997.</p>
<p>Moore said the company has focused more of its resources on market integration and managed care contracting and is &quot;encouraged.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, we firmly believe we will experience an attractive growth in 1997 as a whole over our 1996 results.&quot;</p>
<p>Moore further stated, &quot;Our new bank loan, along with existing cash resources, gives us flexibility and a profitable alternative to using our stock in future acquisitions.</p>
