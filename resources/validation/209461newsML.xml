<dateline>KASESE, Uganda 1996-11-22</dateline>

<p>Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, saying Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko was ailing and unaware of events along their common border, pledged to pursue &quot;dissidents and invaders&quot; back to their bases in Zaire.</p>
<p>Museveni visited the southwestern border region of Kasese on Thursday, a day after the government flew diplomats there.</p>
<p>His visit followed an &quot;invasion&quot; from Zaire last week.</p>
<p>Museveni, dressed in full military uniform and accompanied by 300 soldiers, walked to Lubiriha Bridge, a border crossing, where he declared that dissidents or invaders who attacked Uganda would be pursued to their bases in Zaire or elsewhere.</p>
<p>At Lubiriha, Museveni said: &quot;If the rebels dare attack the country again, they will be crushed and followed up to their bases in Zaire. We will go into attack.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;Mobutu must find a solution to this problem&quot;.</p>
<p>Museveni said that although the rebels and Zairean troops operated from Zairean territory, their logistics and funding came from the Sudan.</p>
<p>&quot;Sudanese financiers are using local commanders to organise these rebels to try to destabilise us,&quot; Museveni said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Museveni said 230 invaders were killed and 30 taken prisoner in fighting in the southwest last week.</p>
<p>He told residents and displaced people at Bwera trading centre that his army had killed many of the rebels involved in the attack and remnants of the attackers fled back to Zaire.</p>
<p>At Bwera, which hosts a military post, he met Zairean soldiers and Uganda dissidents taken prisoners during fighting between the army and the rebels.</p>
<p>Museveni visited Mpondwe customs post to see the damage done by the attackers and was briefed at Lubiriha Bridge about an attack there.</p>
<p>He said he had talked to President Mobutu and exonerated him from any involvement in the recent fighting in which at least 10 Ugandan soldiers were killed and some 70,000 to 75,000 people forced to flee their homes.</p>
<p>Museveni's soldiers made a great show of attempting to cross the border into Zaire but were &quot;restrained&quot; by the president, journalists on the presidential tour said.</p>
