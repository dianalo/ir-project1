<p>Israel and the PLO blamed each other for the collapse on Monday of a three-week U.S. bid to win accord on an army pullout from the West Bank town of Hebron, but insisted that talks will go on in an effort to break a deadlock.</p>
<p>&quot;The thing that's causing the delay at this moment is the absence of a decision or the absence of an order from the highest level on the Palestinian side for the delegation to complete this thing,&quot; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, maintaining that the deal could have been done days ago.</p>
<p>Senior Palestinian official Tayeb Abdel-Rahim countered: &quot;The Israelis are trying to show they are sincere about reaching an agreement, when quite the opposite is happening.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross said he was heading home, having failed in another all-night effort to get the sides to agree on details of the pullout promised by Israel's previous Labour government more than a year ago.</p>
<p>Abdel-Rahim said Palestinians could not acccept Israeli demands to renegotiate elements of the original agreement.</p>
<p>The impasse raised fears of fresh violence in the West Bank and Gaza, a month after unprecedented gun battles claimed the lives of 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis. The bloodshed spurred U.S. President Bill Clinton to order the Ross mission.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the past three weeks we have made substantial progress,&quot; Ross said. But differences remained, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In view of the fact that Chairman Arafat is departing today for scheduled stops in Europe, I am returning to Washington for consultations,&quot; Ross said, in a reference to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's three-day European swing.</p>
<p>Arafat, arriving in Oslo on the first leg of the tour, rejected Israeli charges he was stalling on an agreement for Hebron, the last of seven West Bank towns the Jewish state agreed to hand over to Palestinian self-rule.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sorry to say that still the Israelis are making new conditions every day,&quot; Arafat said. He said agreement could still be reached on Hebron before U.S. elections on November 5.</p>
<p>Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan said Arafat was holding out on granting approval until after the U.S. poll. &quot;He apparently thinks that after elections in the U.S. administration will tend to pressure Israel more,&quot; Bar-Illan told Israel Television.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, both sides said talks would continue.</p>
<p>Hebron, cradle and rallying point of Jewish and Islamic militancy, was tense but quiet on Monday, but violence threatened to resume in other areas.</p>
<p>Arab anger was stirred by the death of a 10-year-old Arab boy, who succumbed in hospital on Monday after being beaten in the West Bank by a Jewish settler who suspected he had thrown stones at Israeli cars, the boy's father said.</p>
<p>Israel's ties with its Arab neighbours have plunged to crisis levels since the hardline Netanyahu defeated Shimon Peres last May with a promise to go slow and get tough in peace talks.</p>
<p>Security sources said Netanyahu's defence chiefs have told him the army needed more than $1 billion because of an increased chance of war with Syria.</p>
<p>But Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, appearing to depart from Netanyahu's unbending line, hinted Israel might cede some of the Golan Heights to Syria in return for peace.</p>
<p>The European Union moved to bolster its role in the peace process, naming a Middle East envoy and pointedly joining with Egypt in urging Israel to pull out of Hebron.</p>
<p>Israelis and Palestinians have logged scores of negotiating hours this month trying to come to terms on the Hebron pullout.</p>
<p>Clinton urged both Arafat and Netanyahu in separate telephone calls on Sunday to seal the deal.</p>
<p>In Hebron, where 400 heavily guarded Jews live amidst 100,000 Arabs, Jewish settlers opened fire near Palestinians on Sunday after their vehicle was pelted with stones.</p>
<p>Palestinians accuse Israel of trying to dictate new terms for the Hebron redeployment, delayed since March. Israel has said adjustments are necessary to safeguard the Jews in Hebron.</p>
<p>Palestinians said the differences centred on Israel's demand for the right to pursue militants into parts of Hebron it hands over, and what arms PLO police would be allowed to carry.</p>
