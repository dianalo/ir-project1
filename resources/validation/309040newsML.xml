<p>Sears, Roebuck and Co. said Wednesday it will donate more than $1 million to establish the Centre of Education and Research in Retailing at the Indiana University School of Business.</p>
<p>Sears said the new centre, the first it has ever endowed as a founding sponsor, is designed to stimulate interest in retailing and sponsor research projects in this area. The centre also will help faculty develop state-of-the-art materials and teaching methods, Sears added.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a natural fit for Sears and Indiana, both being in the Midwest,&quot; Bob Wery, director of college relations for Sears, said by telephone.</p>
<p>He added Indiana University has a strong reputation in business education, ranked highly for graduate and undergraduate programmes.</p>
<p>&quot;Retailing has a long tradition of excellence at Indiana University, but the increased sophisticaton of retail management makes it imperative that business schools develop closer ties to the industry,&quot; Dan Dalton, interim dean of the Indiana University School of Business, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Sears, the nation's second largest retailer with annual revenues of more than $34.0 billion, said the new centre at Indiana University also may help recruitment efforts for it and other store chains.</p>
<p>The donation will be made over coming years.</p>
