<p>Cambodian strongman Hun Sen on Saturday rejected efforts by the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to find a solution to Cambodia's political crisis, Indonesian Foreign Mnister Ali Alatas said.</p>
<p>Hun Sen rejected the regional association's mediation efforts as his forces made advances against troops loyal to ousted First Prime Minster Prince Norodom Ranariddh in the north of the country. The United States meanwhile reiterated that it was not willing to accept his bid for power.</p>
<p>Alatas, who arrived in Phnom Penh on Saturday with Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn and Domingo Siazon of the Philippines, said ASEAN's effort to promote dialogue would cease.</p>
<p>&quot;We were given quite a clear indication that...Hun Sen believes that ASEAN at this stage should not contribute to any solution, that they themselves would find a solution,&quot; Alatas told reporters after talks with Hun Sen. &quot;Clearly as of this moment our efforts will stop.&quot;</p>
<p>The three envoys met King Norodom Sihanouk in Beijing on Thursday and had talks with ousted First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Sihanouk's son, in Bangkok on Friday.</p>
<p>Alatas said both Sihanouk and Ranariddh were in favour of ASEAN's help in finding a solution to Cambodia latest political problems but Hun Sen was not.</p>
<p>&quot;We just hope that things will move peaceably without prolonged tension and instabiltiy not only in Cambodia, but spilling over into south east Asia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hun Sen, who overthrew Ranariddh during street battles earlier this month, was due to hold a news conference on Saturday afternoon but later cancelled it.</p>
<p>On Friday Hun Sen dismissed international efforts to solve his country's political crisis and told foreigners, including ASEAN, to stay out of the Cambodia's affairs.</p>
<p>Cambodia, he said, could survive without ASEAN.</p>
<p>&quot;No foreigner can control Hun Sen ... Please don't interfere.&quot;</p>
<p>ASEAN postponed Cambodia's entry to the grouping indefinitely in response to Ranariddh's ouster. The group also said it still recognised Ranariddh as first prime minister.</p>
<p>Alatas said ASEAN was not interfering in Cambodia's affairs because it was consulting all parties to the conflict. He said he hoped elections scheduled for May would go ahead. Hun Sen has said he wants the poll to be kept.</p>
<p>Alatas said he and his two colleagues would report to foreign ministers from the other four ASEAN countries -- Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam -- on Cambodia, at their annual meeting in Kuala Lumpur on July 23.</p>
<p>Ranariddh told reporters after three hours of talks with the ASEAN trio in Bangkok on Friday he wanted to avoid a new civil war in Cambodia.</p>
<p>Fighting broke out between forces loyal to the rival co-prime ministers on July 5 in Phnom Penh. Hun Sen ousted First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh the following day after Hun Sen took complete control of the capital.</p>
<p>Hun Sen's forces and those loyal to Ranariddh began fighting in northern Cambodia, but the royalists were swiftly pushed back towards the town of Samrong near the Thai border.</p>
<p>Hun Sen's troops moved into Samrong, the last town held by the royalists, on Friday, officials in Phnom Penh said.</p>
<p>The troops arrived peacefully and negotiations with royalist forces were under way, the government officials said.</p>
<p>The United States said special envoy Stephen Solarz will try to develop a &quot;coherent initiative&quot; on the crisis with Asian nations when he visits the region starting on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not willing to concede that the status quo ante cannot be returned to. We are not willing to concede that we should do nothing, when democracy has been flouted so brazenly by Hun Sen in Cambodia,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said on Friday .</p>
<p>&quot;We are not willing to concede that Prince Ranariddh is no longer first prime minister of Cambodia.&quot;</p>
<p>Solarz is a former long-time chairman of the House of Representatives subcommitee on Asia and the Pacific and a key player in U.S. policy leading up to the 1991 Paris treaty that brought a brief peace to Cambodia.</p>
