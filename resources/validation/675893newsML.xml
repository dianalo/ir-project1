<title>MEXICO: Mexican police find new Raul Salinas aliases.</title>
<headline>Mexican police find new Raul Salinas aliases.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-06-20</dateline>

<p>Authorities have unearthed 53 properties, 36 bank accounts and four aliases  belonging to Raul Salinas, jailed brother of ex-president Carlos Salinas, Mexican newspapers reported on Friday.</p>
<p>A deputy attorney general, Jose Luis Ramos Rivera, said the aliases were used by Raul Salinas on falsified passports, birth certificates and other documents &quot;to take money out of the country.&quot;</p>
<p>Raul, who is being held in a maximum-security prison outside Mexico City on murder and illicit enrichment charges, has been accused of stashing more than $100 million in foreign bank accounts while he was on a public servant's salary.</p>
<p>He has pleaded innocent to all the charges against him. His brother, Carlos, is in voluntary exile in Ireland.</p>
<p>Ramos Rivera said authorities had also found 53 houses allegedly owned by Raul and 23 bank accounts abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;Raul Salinas' justification for having taken out the money is that he planned to create a fund to help Mexican workers...I reckon he also wanted to give them houses, because he had more than 50,&quot; he was quoted as joking in the Reforma newspaper.</p>
<p>The announcement came after a two-day search for documentary evidence against Raul in a luxury Mexico City residence owned by the family of Alfredo Diaz Ordaz, with whom Raul Salinas' wife, Paulina Castanon, was previously married.</p>
<p>The search attracted widespread media attention as the house was once the property of another ex-president, Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, whose term of office ended in 1970.</p>
<p>Ramos said Castanon would be called to the Attorney General's Office to explain the discovery of 39 unregistered firearms during the house search.</p>
<p>An irate Castanon told local television earlier in the week that the firearms were collectors items. They had belonged to the bodyguard of former president Diaz Ordaz, and were about to be donated, she said.</p>
