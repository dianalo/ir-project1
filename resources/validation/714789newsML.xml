<p>Shanghai copper futures ended down at intraday lows on Tuesday, dragged down by fresh speculative sales and selling by hedgers triggered by overnight losses on the London Metal Exchange (LME), traders said.</p>
<p>The most actively traded November 1997 contract ended at an intraday low of 21,180 yuan ($2,554) per tonne, losing 400 yuan. It opened at a high of 21,400 yuan per tonne.</p>
<p>July fell 210 to 21,080 yuan per tonne, August 300 to 21,150, September 300 to 21,200, October 440 to 21,150 and December 400 to 21,200 yuan per tonne.</p>
<p>Combined volume rose to 66,660 tonnes from 62,930 tonnes.  </p>
<p>Copper opened lower but mostly at intraday highs and fell further with all contracts closing at lows.</p>
<p>Traders said overnight LME losses depressed the confidence of Shanghai's long position holders and copper was likely to drop further in the next few days.</p>
<p>&quot;New speculative selling, stop-loss orders and selling by hedgers combined to depress today's market given the extremely weak sentiment,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Copper will find it hard to shake off this pessimistic mood in the short term,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Physical prices in the Shanghai area continued to fall, hitting 21,200 yuan from the 21,350-21,400 yuan per tonne indicated on Monday after the poor futures market performance.</p>
<p>Traders said the LME would be an important factor in deciding the future direction of Shanghai copper in the absence of domestic market-moving news.</p>
<p>&quot;Shanghai copper is unlikely to remain steady if the LME does not stop falling in the next few days and further falls on the LME could trigger a new round of panic selling in Shanghai,&quot; a second trader said.  </p>
<p>Most traders said they expected copper to dip further but said it was hard to judge where the bottom line was.</p>
<p>Aluminium ended down. July fell 40 to 13,550 yuan per tonne, August 340 to 13,310, September 160 to 13,720 and October 120 to 13,880 yuan per tonne.</p>
<p>Combined volume fell to 1,000 tonnes from 1,680 tonnes.</p>
