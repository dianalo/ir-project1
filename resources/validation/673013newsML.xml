<p>Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has given Romania encouragement that its bid for NATO membership will succeed if it continues reforms, a State Department statement released on Thursday said.</p>
<p>At a meeting on Wednesday with Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Talbott sought to soothe Bucharest's disappointment over U.S. rejection of Romania's bid for NATO membership this year.</p>
<p>Albright &quot;stressed the importance to the United States of its relations with Romania,&quot; according to the statement issued by acting spokesman John Dinger.</p>
<p>Talbott &quot;expressed full support for Romania's goal of integration into Euro-Atlantic structures,&quot; Dinger said.</p>
<p>Talbott also &quot;expressed his confidence that Romania is on track and will succeed if it continues with political and economic reform,&quot; the spokesman added.</p>
<p>The statement did not define Euro-Atlantic structures but the United States has long touted NATO as the lynchpin of the transatlantic security system it is taking the lead in building in the post-Cold War era.</p>
<p>Also, Washington has insisted that NATO membership remain open to any European country into the indefinite future.</p>
<p>Dinger said later that despite the encouraging words, the statement does not mean the United States has decided to back Romania in a second-round of NATO expansion. &quot;That's a decision that has not been made yet,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United States last week said it favoured including only Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic when NATO announces its first post-Cold War expansion at a July 8-9 summit in Madrid.</p>
<p>That is at odds with France, Italy and others who want to also include Romania and Slovenia in the first wave. Since the alliance operates by consensus, the Clinton administration is confident its stance will prevail.</p>
<p>During Wednesday's meeting at the State Department, Talbott and Ciorbea agreed on the importance of developing a &quot;meaningful U.S.-Romanian strategic partnership&quot; that will include exchanges of official visits, Dinger said.</p>
<p>This would be &quot;based on a recognition of Romania's strategic position in southeastern Europe as well as a commitment to shared values and a common interest in stability and democratic progress,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ciorbea is spending a week in Washington to try to persuade U.S. officials to reverse their decision to oppose early Romanian membership in NATO. He also met on Wednesday with Vice President Al Gore to press his country's case.</p>
