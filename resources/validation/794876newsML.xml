<p>U.S. choreographer Mark Morris, the &quot;enfant terrible&quot; of dance, and American fashion wonder boy Isaac Mizrahi combined to provide the Royal Opera Covent Garden with a sensational comeback at the Edinburgh International Festival.</p>
<p>Morris, 40, brought his talent for fun and extravagance to a little-known 18th century French opera-ballet and turned it into a riot of colour that is likely to prove the hit of the three-week festival.</p>
<p>With Mizrahi, 35, designing the costumes for Jean-Philippe Rameau's &quot;Platee&quot;, the pair transformed the stage into a giant glass terrarium populated by dancing frogs, exotic birds, copulating terrapins and slithering snakes.</p>
<p>Morris, seen as one of the greatest choreographers, was making his debut as a director with the prestigious Royal Opera, which returned to the Edinburgh festival on Monday for the first time since 1961.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an opera that no one has ever heard of. It is a fabulous ballet bouffant. You can really strut your stuff,&quot; he told a news conference ahead of Monday night's premiere. &quot;Isaac and I have worked together several times before and this seemed the perfect thing to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Platee&quot;, an amalgam of song, dance and spectacle, was originally created for the French court at Versailles in 1745. The story features a cast of Greek gods who play a trick on a spectacularly ugly amphibian who lives in a a swamp.</p>
<p>Morris turns the already surreal plot into a dazzling visual joke, populated by a cast of animal dancers as fabulous as they are freakish.</p>
<p>Scotsman newspaper critic Christopher Bowen said the opera was the perfect vehicle for Morris and Mizrahi, the designer dubbed the &quot;boy wonder&quot; of fashion after launching his own label in 1987 at the age of 25.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the choreographer who seamlessly melds irreverence with a musical sensitivity so innate it can make you weep,&quot; wrote Bowen.</p>
<p>&quot;He can move from formality to slapstick in a single dance yet he has no qualms about letting singers just stand and sing unencumbered by the directorial business so frequently imposed on them by lesser 'enfant terribles'.&quot;</p>
<p>Mizrahi, whose imagination has already led to several  forays into the world of theatre and film, said he had jumped at the chance to work with Morris on &quot;Platee&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;What made me so excited about it was that it is so silly. It is almost like vaudeville. Your fantasy just reels, there is no end to what you can do.&quot;</p>
