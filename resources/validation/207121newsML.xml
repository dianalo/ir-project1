<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss bond market closing report.</title>
<headline>Swiss bond market closing report.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1996-11-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Swiss bond prices were lower in late trade but ended slightly above day session lows.</p>
<p>The December Swiss confederate bond futures contract repeatedly hit 114.90 to the downside in the afternoon, and dropped to just below that level in the final minutes of trade.</p>
<p>The day session low of 114.76 was roughly in the 114.80 area which has been the low in four other sessions since the contract moved into a higher range on November 11.</p>
<p>Swiss prices showed little reaction to new data. The Philadelphia Fed November index was slightly higher than expected. U.S. bond prices fell after the index came out.  </p>
<p>The index was reported at 6.4, compared with an average forecast for the index of 5.0 in November.</p>
<p>This compared with 5.3 in October.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, inflation in the city of Basle fell 0.1 percent in November from October for a year-on-year inflation rate of 1.0 percent, down slightly from the year-on-year rate of 1.1 percent recorded in the previous month.</p>
<p>The Swiss National Bank, as expected, left interest rates unchanged after its regular weekly policy-setting committee.</p>
<p>Swiss sight deposits were also down by 346.8 million Swiss francs at 3.142 billion in the 10-day period ended November 20.  </p>
<p>An increase in sight deposits at the end of the last 10-day period was seen as a sign that the SNB was willing to keep banks supplied with liquidity to keep money market interest rates from rising.</p>
<p>The spread between Swiss and German 10-year federal bond yields also continued to narrow to at times 188 basis points compared with 190 late on Wednesday  YLDS3. Earlier in the year the spread was closer to 210 basis points.</p>
<p>Activity was generally thin with activity seen slowing down before Christmas.  </p>
<p>-- Thursday closing prices as follows:</p>
<p>Dec Conf futures down 20 at 114.85.</p>
<p>Dec Comi medium-term bond down five at 109.70</p>
<p>Dec Euro Swiss francs off one at 97.70.</p>
<p>4-1/2 Apr 2006 bond 104.20/30 yield 3.939 pct</p>
<p>(Close Wednesday 104.45/55 yield 3.91 pct)</p>
<p>4-1/2 Jun 2007 bond 104.00/10 yield 4.013 pct</p>
