<p>Australia's telecommunications industry could represent the largest sector on the local share market in the next few years with a swag of planned floats that are eagerly awaited by investors, analysts said.</p>
<p>The initial focus will be on Optus Communications Pty Ltd which is expected to raise up to A$1.5 billion in a share market float by the end of 1996, followed by the huge but now-troubled partial sale of the government's carrier Telstra Corp.  </p>
<p>About A$8 billion is expected to be raised from the one-third sale of Telstra, but this is not likely until the 1997/98 year and first requires legislative approval in the upper house where the government does not have a majority.</p>
<p>A few other telecom industry floats are expected over the next five years.</p>
<p>&quot;The feeling is Optus is going to go very, very well,&quot; said one Sydney-based industry analyst, who forecast solid demand for teleom-related issues as the industry is one of the fastest growing sectors of the Australian economy.  </p>
<p>Its growth rates are likely to remain high in the forseeable future, the analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are not many sectors that are attractive at the moment, manufacturing looks pretty tough and building materials are not so great.&quot;</p>
<p>Investors are attracted to shares in telecom carriers as they are likely to have a high dividend payout.</p>
<p>&quot;Telecommunications stocks have been seen as a utility, which is a yield stock, and they would probably move more in line with bonds,&quot; a second Sydney-based analyst said.  </p>
<p>Analysts said Telstra would be a top five company on the Australian Stock Exchange, and the planned partial sale of the carrier would represent three percent of the market.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) said the ASX was considering a telecommunications index due to the planned floats of Optus and Telstra, but he could not say when it would be introduced. A telecommunications index could be a very significant part of the overall market, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Within three to four years, assuming that all of Telstra and all of Optus are in the index, you are looking at about 20 percent of the All Ordinaries,&quot; a third analyst said.  </p>
<p>&quot;By the time you put in Vodafone Australia, as they are going to float half of that at some stage, you are looking at another one percent and by the time you get a couple of Internet service providers in there and a few other bits and pieces you could be up to 25 percent of the (All Ordinaries) index.&quot;</p>
<p>The local banks and finance sector makes up about 18 percent of the All Ordinaries, making it the largest sub-indice.</p>
<p>Vodafone Australia, a unit of Vodafone Plc of the United Kingdom, has an option to float locally by the year 2002.  </p>
<p>Analysts also tipped the nation's third largest telecom carrier, AAPT Telecommunications Pty Ltd, as another potential float candidate.</p>
<p>Others included potential telecom consortiums that are established after the Australian market is fully deregulated on July 1, 1997.</p>
