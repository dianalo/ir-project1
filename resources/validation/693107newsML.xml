<headline>OPTIONS - BTP vol up, Bunds down amid EMU tensions.</headline>

<p>BTP volatilities edged higher and Bund vols eased as investors continued to pile into puts amid single currency nervousness, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>Investors had been buying downside put options in Bunds and liquidating BTP put portfolios as the prospects for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) brightened over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>But that trend was less pronounced on Friday after Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen said Germany was unlikely to meet the debt-to-GDP goal.</p>
<p>He also said Germany would have difficulty in meeting the deficit target.</p>
<p>On Friday, Bund options traders were frustrated about the market's reluctance to jolt from a narrow range.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is sitting on a range, if there is no change the vol will be hit again,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Some 3,000 lots of the September 101.50-102.00 straddle and 3,000 August 100.00 puts were exchanged.</p>
<p>Implied volatility of the September 102.00 straddle hovered just above 5.0 percent, down two ticks from Thursday, traders said. The August 102.00 straddle fetched 4.80-4.90 percent.</p>
<p>About 6,000 puts between 101.50 and 99.00 strikes were also traded, they said.</p>
<p>By 1300 GMT, September Bund futures were quoted 0.03 lower on the day at 101.85.</p>
<p>In BTPs, the main activity was on September where at-the-money vols inched higher to 7.5 percent from 7.3.-7.4 on Thursday, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The vol is still pretty well supported,&quot; said one trader in Italy, adding that a higher vol stemmed from a fall in futures prices following the market's record-breaking streak in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>September BTP futures stood 12 basis points lower at 134.18.</p>
<p>Downside puts at 130.00, 131.50 and 132.00 strikes traded about 2,000 lots, outpacing calls.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past few days the skew in the upside calls has steepened while the skew on the downside put has flattened,&quot; said the trader, adding that call offers were more aggressive.</p>
<p>The vol on downside puts plunged, he said.</p>
<p>Traders saw upside potential for BTPs if EMU news improved, and vols could go even higher. In recent days, upside calls around 140.00 and 136.00 attracted significant interest.</p>
<p>But the risk was still on the downside for BTPs.</p>
<p>&quot;People are still fearing that the whole thing can collapse. The vast majority of traders are still long of the puts and they will hold on to this position for the time being,&quot; said the Italian trader.</p>
<p>German Chancellor and Finance Minister Theo Waigel rushed to defend euro prospects saying the single currency would start on time and would not be soft.</p>
