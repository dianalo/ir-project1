<p>A shadowy figure in the controversy over President Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election fundraising practices regularly used business facilities of an Arkansas investment firm while employed as a senior Commerce Department official, informed sources said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The activities of John Huang, whose fundraising efforts on behalf of Clinton and the Democratic Party during last year's campaign is already a matter of embarrassment for the president, will be a prime topic of Senate hearings on campaign financing abuses set to open on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A secretary in the Washington office of the Little Rock- based Stevens Company named Paula Green is prepared to testify that Huang, who held a top-secret security clearance while on the government payroll, frequently visited the office to use the telephone and fax machine, the sources said.</p>
<p>They described Green's testimony as potentially explosive because it follows Republican charges that Huang passed classified information to the Lippo Group, an Indonesian conglomerate with close ties to China.</p>
<p>The hearings will focus in part on allegations, denied by the parties, that Asian business interests and the government of China tried to gain U.S. influence by funnelling money into Clinton's campaign for a second term and other American political contests.</p>
<p>They are expected to compete for attention with Clinton's eight-day trip to Europe to help with the birth of an expanded NATO. The president and his wife Hillary on Saturday began a holiday in this Mediterranean island resort before the July 8-9 NATO summit in Madrid.</p>
<p>Representative Gerald Solomon, a New York Republican who heads a House committee looking into the fundraising controversy, said last month that &quot;government sources&quot; had told him there were electronic intercepts showing that Huang had breached national security by passing secrets to his former employer.</p>
<p>&quot;If he (Huang) misused his position of trust, the president will not defend that,&quot; a White House official said. This individual added that the allegations were unproven, and cautioned against a rush to judgment.</p>
<p>Before Huang joined the Clinton administration in late 1993 as a deputy assistant Secretary of Commerce, a position that gave him access to classified briefings on U.S. trade policy and strategy, he was the top U.S. representative of Lippo, which also has ties to the Stevens Company.</p>
<p>Huang moved to the Democratic National Committee in December, 1995 and began raising millions of dollars from Asian-Americans. The DNC has since had to return some $1.5 million of the money he collected because of suspicions it came from foreign sources, which is illegal under U.S. law.</p>
<p>Huang has refused to cooperate with the various investigations that are now underway, citing his Fifth Amendment constitutional protection against self-incrimination.</p>
