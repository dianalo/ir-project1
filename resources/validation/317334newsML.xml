<p>Six people were killed and one U.S. citizen was seriously wounded when Hutu militiamen attacked an aid workers compound in the northern Rwandan town of Ruhengeri, a western diplomat said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The dead in the Saturday (corrects from Sunday) evening attack included three Rwandan soldiers, the diplomat said. A senior U.N. source said the three others killed were local employees of the medical charity Medecins du Monde.</p>
<p>&quot;U.N. people were told to stay put and not go out. And as soon as we have talked to the army we will be discussing whether or not to suspend operations.&quot; the U.N. official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The fighting appeared to have started in the slum areas of town among returnees who have come back from Zaire. There were two other incidents during the night during which a grenade was thrown into an aid workers house, a senior U.N. official said.</p>
<p>The attack was the latest in a series involving expatriates in the area, which is near the border with Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an attack on a compound Housing Medecins Sans Frontieres, Medecins du Monde and Save the Children,&quot; said the western diplomat. The compound is 225 km (140 miles) northwest of the capital, Kigali.</p>
<p>The diplomat would not identify the American: &quot;The U.S. citizen has already had his leg amputated, is unconscious and will be medevaced today,&quot;</p>
<p>The United Nations had warned on Saturday that escalating violence in Rwanda could force suspension of humanitarian operations in some areas.</p>
<p>&quot;I am surprised at the violence. I'd rather not put people in danger and if this violence continues then I have no option but to suspend operations in some areas,&quot; Omar Bakhet, U.N. Rwanda coordinator, told Reuters.</p>
<p>On Monday and Wednesday at Giciyi, in southern Gisenyi prefecture, two United Nations vehicles were attacked with gunfire and hand grenades and two expatriate staff were beaten by Hutu militia, according to U.N. officials.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, grenades were thrown at a road construction lorry run by a Chinese company. The same day, 12 Rwandans were killed by militiamen outside Giciyi.</p>
<p>Last week three Rwandan civilians were shot dead and three others wounded when 60 suspected Hutu militiamen attacked a hospital in northwestern Rwanda. Two doctors from Medecins Sans Frontieres there were threatened with death by militiamen.</p>
