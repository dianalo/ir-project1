<p>Rising stock prices helped nudge a key gauge of national economic activity modestly higher in October, the private Conference Board said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Index of Leading Indicators, which is supposed to forecast economic trends six to nine months ahead, rose 0.1 percent in October after a revised 0.2 percent September gain.</p>
<p>It was the ninth consecutive month in which the broad-based index increased, suggesting the 5-1/2-year-old economic expansion will carry on into 1997.  </p>
<p>The leading index measures a basket of economic indicators ranging from unemployment benefit claims to building permits. Six of its 11 components strengthened in October while five showed some deline from September.</p>
<p>The signals of rising activity in October were led by strong gains in stock market prices and a brisker pace of new orders for consumer goods. In addition, there were higher order backlogs, fewer new claims for unemployment pay, slower deliveries by busy vendors and a gain in commodity prices.</p>
<p>The indicators that weakened during October included a shorter factory workweek, fewer new plant and equipment orders and reduced applications for building permits. Two measures -- money supply and consumer expectations -- were unchanged from September.</p>
<p>The change in the monthly index was in line with Wall Street economists' forecasts and was consistent with other indications that the economic expansion that began in the spring of 1991 continues on a steady but modest upward track.</p>
<p>Two reports on Monday initially rattled financial markets that favor slow but steady growth rather than a robust pickup that could cause inflation risks to flare.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said that October construction spending had climbed a surprisingly strong 1.8 percent when analysts were looking for a slowdown. And the National Association of Purchasing Management said the manufacturing sector strengthened in November for a sixth consecutive month with strong new orders and production.</p>
<p>But the purchasing managers' report contained little sign of rising prices, which calmed markets later. Similarly, the steady string of gains in the leading index that started last February have mostly been of modest size, suggesting ongoing growth but not a surge in the ecconomic pace.</p>
<p>Much current attention is focused on retail sales leading up to Christmas, with expectations that shoppers will spend more this year and so add economic stimulus. But the October leading index provided little guidance since it showed consumer expectations unchanged from September following a lackluster pace of spending in the third quarter.</p>
