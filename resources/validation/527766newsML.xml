<title>BRAZIL: Brazil Justice suggests suspension of CVRD auction.</title>
<headline>Brazil Justice suggests suspension of CVRD auction.</headline>
<dateline>BRASILIA 1997-04-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brazil's Supreme Court Justice Marco Aurelio de Mello suggested that the April 29 privatization of state mining firm Cia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) be suspended as a result of a court injunction, local news agency InvestNews said.</p>
<p>The agency quoted Mello as saying the new court injunction would not allow the government to include 411,000 hectares of CVRD's huge Carajas iron mine in the sale.</p>
<p>Mello said the injunction did not require a suspension of the auction, but made the sale pointless.</p>
<p>&quot;If the (National Development Bank) had any sense, the auction should be suspended,&quot; the Justice was quoted as saying.  </p>
<p>The injunction, sought by opposition lawmakers, was granted by Mello on Tuesday, but still needs to be approved by the full Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF). The date for a hearing by the high court has still not been set.</p>
<p>In a statement, the STF said that, under the constitution, Congress must approve any concession of over 2,500 hectares by the president.</p>
<p>The 411,000 hectares of the Carajas mine were transferred to CVRD in a presidential decree signed by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on March 6, the same day tender documents for the sale were published.  </p>
<p>The Planning Ministry, however, said it is too early to determine if the auction should be suspended.</p>
<p>Carajas, the biggest iron ore deposit in the world with reserves of 15 billion tonnes, is Vale's main mining asset.</p>
<p>An expected bidder on CVRD declined to comment on the ruling or the possibility the auction will be suspended.</p>
<p>&quot;We are waiting to see the details of the (justice's) statement on the injunction,&quot; an official at private Brazilian steelmaker Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN), which is leading one of two consortia planning to bid at the auction.</p>
<p>The government plans to sell a maximum 45 percent stake in CVRD and has set a base price of 3.0 billion reais ($2.83 billion). The government hopes to take in at least $5 billion.</p>
