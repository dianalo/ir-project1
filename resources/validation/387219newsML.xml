<p>Springbok rugby manager Andre Markgraaff said on Wednesday the South African Rugby Football Union (SARFU) had accepted his resignation, tendered after he admitted making racist remarks.</p>
<p>&quot;I have tendered my resignation to SARFU. It was accepted, they did not fire me,&quot; he told a news conference in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been crucified and I have lost all emotional energy, I need time to resettle and think what is important in my life right now but I reiterate I am not a racist.&quot;</p>
<p>Markgraaff announced his resignation on Tuesday, a day before a SARFU inquiry into allegations that his was the voice making insulting racist remarks about blacks in a secretly taped conversation, broadcast on national television on Monday.</p>
<p>Acknowledging he had made the comments, Markgraaff said he was stepping down in the interests of South African rugby and apologised to the country's blacks.</p>
<p>The incident has brought fresh embarrassment to a game trying to shake off claims that it is still living in the old apartheid South Africa.</p>
