<p>SUGAR - SUGAR: World market for August 18, 1997</p>
<p>White sugar futures in London closed lower across the board following a weaker New York market. October lost $2.20 to close at $326.40 per tonne, while December gave up $1.70 to close at $323.70 per tonne.</p>
<p>Raw sugar futures in New York closed lower in a technical reaction to Friday's sharp gains. October lost 4 points to close at 11.82 cents/lb, while March ended 5 points lower at 12.00 cents/lb. The trade was a light seller of the October/March spread, which closed at 18 points, unchanged from Friday. Otherwise the market was quiet with the latest European beet test results painting a promising picture of this year's crop.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>UKRAINE - The latest beet test result of August confirmed that the beet crop in Ukraine is on good course. Beet weight per ha reached 17.71 tonnes, sharply up on last year's 14.40 tonnes, while sugar content amounted to 11.40 per cent, compared to 12.50 per cent in 1996. This resulted in a theoretical sugar weight of 2.02 tonnes, white value, per ha, 12.2 per cent up on the 1996 result. The high number of beets per ha (82,000 vs 77,000 units) suggests that the potential for further improvement is good.</p>
<p>RUSSIA - The beet tests taken on August 10 confirmed that yields are likely to be up on last year's although it seems unlikely that the rise will compensate for the sharp fall in the area drilled. Root weight reached 270 grams, up from 234 grams in 1996, while sugar content amounted to 11.60 per cent compared to 12.00 per cent in 1996. This resulted in a sugar weight per root of 31.32 grams, 11.5 per cent up on the 1996 result. However, the figures are not very revealing, as no data on root yields or number of plants per ha are available.</p>
<p>GERMANY - The latest beet test results of August 15 reflect the sunny and dry weather of recent weeks which resulted in a considerable rise in sugar content while the gain in root weight was less impressive. Root yield now stands at 41.68 tonnes per ha against 40.35 tonnes in 1996 and the five-year average (1992/96) of 42.14 tonnes. Sugar content was 15.0 per cent, unchanged from the 1996 result, but down on the average of 15.60 per cent. This resulted in a theoretical sugar weight of 6.26 tonnes, white value, per ha, 3 per cent up on the 1996 result, but 4.7 per cent down on the five-year average. An above average weight of foliage and number of roots per ha indicate that there is further room for improvement.</p>
<p>SWEDEN - Sugar exports in May 1997 amounted to 13,310 tonnes, raw value, up from 1,465 tonnes in May 1996. This brought cumulative exports in the first three quarters of 1996/97 (September/May) up to 47,327 tonnes against 17,481 tonnes in the like period the previous year. Total exports in 1995/96 amounted to 32,574 tonnes against 17,610 tonnes in 1994/95. Major countries of destination in 1996/97 were Norway with 14,735 tonnes whites against 1,328 tonnes, Denmark with 12,169 tonnes against 178 tonnes and Uzbekistan with 6,999 tonnes, up from 3,250 tonnes.</p>
<p>TENDERS</p>
<p>Syria's General Foreign Trade Organization for Chemicals and Foodstuffs (GEZA) issued a buying tender for 26,000 tonnes of white and 26,000 tonnes of raw sugar for October delivery. The tender amends GEZA's August 7 tender which requested the purchase of 13,000 tonnes of white and 13,000 tonnes of raw sugar. GEZA said the new amount should be delivered in two equal shipments each of 13,000 tonnes of white sugar and two others each of 13,000 tonnes of raws.</p>
