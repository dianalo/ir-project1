<title>UK: High grade cobalt main focus of minor metals.</title>
<headline>High grade cobalt main focus of minor metals.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>A bouyant high grade cobalt market was the main feature of European industrial metals trading during the past week.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Russian cobalt climbed with its counterpart, while antimony firmed. Molybdendum, on short-covering, moved higher as recent downside pressure bottomed out.</p>
<p>Traders said extremely low global stocks aided the spike in high grade cobalt, sparking a mid-week flurry of buying from consumers fearful of even higher prices.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been covering emerging in the market as people eye the low stocks of good grade material,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Several traders suggested inventory of global high grade material currently stands at under 100 tonnes.</p>
<p>Other traders agreed world stocks were low but said an upcoming DLA sale could help to alleviate the tightness.</p>
<p>&quot;I agree the stock levels are low but I also believe there is enough material around to balance the supply/demand,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>&quot;The DLA are a regulator of prices and supply,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>There was unconfirmed market talk that France may be interested in selling some of its stockpiled material. Traders noted news on Thursday that that producer Falconbridge's Kristiansand smelter in Norway was running at full capacity after production problems in October. &quot;We had problems in late October and we had to reduce production for a few days but we have been running at full speed since early November,&quot; a company spokesman told Reuters. Falconbridge declined to comment on how much output was lost during the period. The facility has an annual capacity of 3,700 tonnes of super-high-grade cobalt.</p>
<p>It also produces 39,000 tonnes of copper and 69,000 tonnes of nickel.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe they lost upwards of 60 tonnes production,&quot; one trader said. Others said the loss of production could be higher, but were unable to confirm tonnages.</p>
<p>On Monday, Falconbridge said its inventory of cobalt was lower than normal.</p>
<p>&quot;If we're tight in anything it would be cobalt,&quot; Shelton Yip, Falconbridge's director of market research, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Falconbridge also confirmed market talk of a recent theft of 10 tonnes of high grade cobalt worth almost $500,000 stored in Rotterdam, though several London traders believed 20 tonnes were stolen.</p>
<p>Antimony firmed as sellers backed off.</p>
<p>Traders said there was market talk of a gathering of Chinese producers recently which may have set a floor above current market levels.</p>
<p>They also noted consumer buying. Fresh short-covering and trade buying drove molybdendum higher. &quot;Its a correction to a recent oversold condition,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>He explained that shorts had to cover when they discovered prices were unlikely to fall further. &quot;Its the run-of-the-mill bounce when we see a market oversold,&quot; he added. Available oxide material was scarce and probed higher levels.</p>
<p>Several traders said the molybdendum market in general had the potential to climb further against the background of interest from the steel industry.</p>
<p>Other minor metals remained slow at little chnaged levels. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8075</p>
