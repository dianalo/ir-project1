<p>As President Clinton prepares to host the annual summit of leading industrial democracies this week in Denver, he is blessed with an economy that is the envy of the world.</p>
<p>Unemployment is at its lowest level in nearly 24 years, the federal government budget deficit is small and shrinking, and inflation is low and stable.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in what is going to be viewed in retrospect as one of the really golden eras of the U.S. economy,&quot; Robert Dederick, consulting economist to Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, said.</p>
<p>The contrast with America's industrial nation partners could not be starker. Japan is just now righting itself after five years of near-recession conditions while much of Europe remains saddled with sky-high unemployment.</p>
<p>&quot;The summit is a bad place for the United States to take other nations to school, but on this issue it has the right to do so,&quot; said Everett Ehrlich, a former U.S. official who nows heads ESC Co. consultants in Washington.</p>
<p>The June 20-22 summit will bring together the leaders and top ministers from the so-called Group of Seven -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. Russian President Boris Yeltsin will also attend much of the meeting.</p>
<p>U.S. officials and analysts attribute America's economic success to a variety of factors.</p>
<p>&quot;The great credit for this remarkable economic turnaround goes primarily to American businesses and workers, to small businesses, and entrepreneurs, to those on the cutting edge of research and development,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>Free of many of the government regulations that hamper their rivals overseas, big U.S. companies downsized and restructured their operations in the 1980s and are now well-positioned to compete worldwide.</p>
<p>Budding entrepreneurs are also better off in the United States than in other industrial nations, thanks to the depth and breadth of America's financial markets.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the only country in the world where people who don't own a suit but who are very good at some aspect of commercial development science, can raise $100 million, $200 million or a billion dollars on dreams,&quot; Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said.</p>
<p>The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve also deserve some of the credit for the stellar American economy, analysts said. The U.S. budget deficit has fallen steadily over the past five years, freeing up resources for use by the private sector and helping to spark an investment boom.</p>
<p>Under Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, the U.S. central bank has kept inflation in check without throttling the economy, allowing the expansion to continue and unemployment to fall.</p>
<p>Another key factor: the rapid spread of computers and other technology in the workplace, which has helped hold down corporate costs. In addition, the globalization of the world economy has made it harder for companies to raise prices due to increased competition from overseas, helping keep inflation in check.</p>
<p>&quot;Our economy has done so well that it is really the envy of most of our trading partners,&quot; White House chief economist Janet Yellen said. &quot;We have a combination of low inflation and low unemployment.&quot;</p>
<p>But that does not mean that the United States is without economic problems. The U.S. savings rate is low, income inequality is wide and the population is ageing, threatening to put severe strains on social services in the next century.</p>
