<p>Russia's hard-pressed economy shrank further in 1996 and Moscow must work hard to reverse the long and painful decline this year, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole of 1996 was a year of stagnation,&quot; said Jochen Wermuth, head of the Finance Ministry's Economic Expert Group. &quot;Some painful decisions will have to be made in 1997 and 1998 to get the economy on track by 2000.&quot;</p>
<p>The State Statistics Committee said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by six percent last year, after a decline of four percent in 1995 and 13 percent in 1994.</p>
<p>It was the fifth year of falling GDP, making a mockery of repeated forecasts that the economy would soon begin to grow.</p>
<p>Industrial output, which has halved since Russia launched its market reforms in January 1992, contracted by five percent.</p>
<p>Russian data tend to underreport a growing private sector, although officials have made efforts to improve their figures.</p>
<p>&quot;This economy probably did not decline by six percent last year, but it is clearly not booming,&quot; said a Western economist.</p>
<p>&quot;If they can consolidate macroeconomic stabilisation, cut tax evasion and push ahead with structural reforms the economy could grow this year.&quot;</p>
<p>Hard-hit sectors include defence, where the cash-strapped military can barely afford new equipment, and cars and consumer goods, which face tough competition from imported goods.</p>
<p>&quot;Output has halved, but it's not really that disconcerting,&quot; said Wermuth. &quot;It's mostly tanks and things like that.&quot;</p>
<p>Economists said a lasting turnaround would depend to a large extent on the Russian government adopting painful decisions to restructure the economy, raise prices for heavily subsidised housing and declare ailing firms bankrupt.</p>
<p>Such decisions were put on ice last year during President Boris Yeltsin's costly campaign for re-election, they said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, suffering first from heart problems and now from pneumonia, has spent most of the first seven months of his new term away from the Kremlin. He has been in hospital for much of this month, but was leaving for a country residence on Monday.</p>
<p>Yields on GKO Treasury bills rose to almost 200 percent during the election campaign, diverting domestic and foreign cash to the lucrative government market and freezing investment.</p>
<p>Yields have now fallen to around 35 percent and cash is leaving government securities for Russia's booming share market, where prices hit new record highs on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock market...is driven by the weight of investment, by money,&quot; said Martin Diggle, director of Brunswick brokerage in Moscow.</p>
<p>The World Bank's International Finance Corporation in Washington said earlier this month that Russia was the world's best-performing emerging stock market in 1996, with a return of 155.9 percent in dollar terms.</p>
<p>Other problems facing the economy include widespread payment delays and sluggish tax collection last year.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund withheld two tranches of a $10 billion three-year loan to Russia in the final quarter because it was concerned about the low tax revenues.</p>
<p>But Wermuth said revenue collection had risen sharply in December. &quot;We could see 45 trillion roubles ($8 billion) of revenue in December, compared to 13 trillion in September,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts say another bright spot in the economic picture is a steep fall in inflation, which tumbled below 22 percent in the year to December, from 131 percent in the year to December 1995.</p>
<p>The government expects 1997 inflation of around 12 percent. ($1=5612 Rouble)</p>
