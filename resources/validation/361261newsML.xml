<p>The winds of change have been blowing more than a draft through local British electricity networks, making Britain the fourth largest user of wind energy in Europe.</p>
<p>Britain's 34 wind farms doubled their output in 1996 to 505 million kilowatt hours -- enough to meet the average needs of over 120,000 households, according to latest figures released by the British Wind Energy Association (BWEA).</p>
<p>But Britain still ranks behind Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands in its use of wind resources, despite the fact its potential is more than twice as large as these countries combined.</p>
<p>The BWEA plans to be supplying more than a light breeze in the future. The association's long-term aim is to supply 10 percent of the national electricity output by 2025.</p>
<p>BWEA chairman Peter Edwards said the association currently had 152 new projects under government consideration.</p>
<p>&quot;Delivering electricity into the local network saves on the costs of high voltage transmission and avoids electrical losses, bringing economic and environmental benefits,&quot; Edwards said.</p>
<p>He said wind energy was cheap, producing electricity at under four pence per unit, equivalent to oil-fired power. Only natural gas produces electricity at a lower cost, he said.</p>
<p>Wind energy is widely seen as one of the cleanest and safest commercial methods of generating electricity, as well as being a renewable and sustainable source.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief wind energy does not kill birds, rarely causes interference on televisions and makes very little noise, Edwards said.</p>
<p>&quot;People's biggest objection is that they don't like the look of the wind farms, but in fact 80 percent of people asked said they preferred to look at them than any other power station,&quot; Edwards said.</p>
<p>Leading environmental groups are vigorously supporting wind power developments, citing wind as leading the way for other renewable energy forms.</p>
<p>&quot;The thing about all the renewable technologies, not just wind power, is that they don't cause climate change or create radioactive waste -- developing wind power is an environmental imperative,&quot; said Dr Patrick Green of green lobby group Friends of the Earth.</p>
