<p>The Belgian who leads mercenaries fighting for the Zairian government said on Sunday that rebel forces currently held the upper hand.</p>
<p>Christian Tavernier also accused Uganda of supporting the rebels, fighting to overthrow Zaire's president of 31 years, Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>&quot;There are well-organised armed units coming from Uganda who carry out an operation, attack a position, and then retreat,&quot; Christian Tavernier told Belgian radio RTBF.</p>
<p>&quot;That means...the balance of strength is currently against us,&quot; he said on the telephone from eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>He added: &quot;The Zairean army is in a tangle, like the rest of the country, with almost no logistics.&quot;</p>
<p>The rebels have advanced quickly from the east on several fronts, blunting an army counter-offensive launched from Zaire's third city of Kisangani on January 20.</p>
<p>Zaire defence ministry officials said on Sunday it was likely the eastern town of Kalima, about 400 km (250 miles) south of Kisangani, had been overrun by rebels.</p>
<p>Colonel Willy Mallants, a former adviser to President Mobutu who is now on the rebels' side, told RTBF that Kisangani was not a target as such. Mallants, who is now a political and military adviser for the Alliance of Democratic Forces of rebel leader Laurent Kabila, also accused the Zairean government of employing war criminals.</p>
<p>&quot;Kisangani will not be a military target unless it is used as a base for criminal raids against civilians who have already suffered enough from aeroplanes commanded by Serbo-Croats and others from foreign countries who, if my information is correct, should be before the international tribunal in the Hague which must try war criminals,&quot; Mallants told RTBF in Brussels.</p>
