<headline>Israeli shares end sharply higher.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1997-01-05</dateline>

<p>Israeli shares closed sharply higher on Sunday following a rise in Israeli stocks traded in New York, particularly Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 3.75 percent, or 8.04 points, to 222.19 on high all-share turnover of 109 million shekels against 82 million shekels on Sunday, the last day of trading before the Israeli weekend.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index climbed 3.55 percent to 229.96.</p>
<p>&quot;The session opened with high demand of 200 million shekels as against a supply of only five million shekels,&quot; said a trader at Bank Leumi.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all in sympathy to movement in the United States,&quot; said Jonathan Ross, vice-president at Nesuah Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The Maof index broke the key resistance barrier of 223 points today for the first time after a very long time. The breaking of this barrier, together with the sharp rise of Teva set the market on fire,&quot; said Julien Assous, an analyst at Sahar Securities.</p>
<p>Traders said Teva accounted for a rise of 1.2 percent in the Maof. Teva, the most active share, surged the maximum 10 percent to 1,770 on volume of 10.8 million shekels after rising nearly 10 percent in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>Ross said the rise came after a U.S. brokerage set a very high end-1997 target price on the stock.</p>
<p>&quot;On the technical side for the past three years, there's been a hard ceiling of 223-244,&quot; Ross added.</p>
<p>Danny Scharia, of Capital Holdings, ascribed part of the rally to the new year optimism that began last Thursday, the first trading day of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the main reasons for the rise is that there are simply no sellers in the market,&quot; Assous said. &quot;Maof shares rose sharply but the main gainers were the medium - and small-capitalisation stocks,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Arbitrage stocks closed higher with Discount Investments rising 4.5 percent to 22,718 and IDB Development Corp gaining 4.5 percent to 6,332 following a 10 percent rise in their Nasdaq-traded affiliate Scitex Corp in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>Clal Electronic Industries, which also owns a big block of Scitex, was up 5.0 percent to 32,782.</p>
<p>Other active shares included Koor Industries, which rose 3.25 percent to 29,041 on turnover of 8.0 million shekels, and Bank Leumi, which climbed 3.0 percent to 469 on volume of 5.3 million shekels.</p>
