<title>ROMANIA: Romania stops striking miners flooding Bucharest.</title>

<p>Romanian authorities stopped trains and deployed busloads of riot police on Tuesday to keep striking coal miners from advancing on the capital Bucharest, where they went on the rampage twice in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Thousands of miners in the miners' main stronghold of the Jiu Valley, 400 km (250 miles) west of Bucharest, held noisy rallies at coal board offices to press demands for big pay increases and increased job security.</p>
<p>But trade union leaders later pledged not to descend on the capital, prompting ministers negotiating with the strikers to restore train services within hours.</p>
<p>The state news agency Rompres quoted the Transport Ministry as saying that all services had resumed to Petrosani, the focal point of the stoppage. It said protesting miners had dispersed pending the outcome of negotiations in Bucharest.</p>
<p>Some miners had been demanding the release of trade union leader Miron Cosma, standing trial on charges of undermining state authority. Cosma is alleged to have led the second of the two miners' upheavals in Bucharest in 1991.</p>
<p>The Bucharest Court of Appeal on Tuesday rejected Cosma's petition to be released from custody during proceedings.</p>
<p>Earlier, the head of Romania's state-run railway said 16 trains in the Jiu Valley had been cancelled and six rerouted.</p>
<p>The independent Mediafax news agency said several busloads of police had been moved into position in the southern part of the Jiu Valley, some distance from the strikebound mines.</p>
<p>Furious miners converged on Bucharest in June 1990 and September 1991, ransacking political party and government offices and beating up liberal students and activists.</p>
<p>Four people were killed in the first incident, when miners attacked students and government opponents staging protests against the ex-communists who took control of Romania in the aftermath of the December 1989 anti-communist revolution.</p>
<p>Three died in the second wave of violence, which culminated in the dismissal of Romania's first post-communist government.</p>
<p>The current strike is aimed at securing 45 per cent pay rises and guarantees against job losses. The centrist government, elected last year, wants to close uneconomic mines.</p>
<p>Government negotiators have rejected the pay demands and said that planned tax cuts would give the miners the equivalent of pay increases of up to 20 per cent.</p>
<p>Miners earn twice the average monthly pay of $80 when production bonuses and communist-era privileges like rent, electricity and transport discounts are taken into account.</p>
