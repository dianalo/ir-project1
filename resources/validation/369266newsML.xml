<p>Poland's banking climate index &quot;Pengab&quot; fell 8.3 points to 43.4 in February from 51.7 in January and was 0.7 point lower than in February 1996, a poll released on Tuesday by the private Pentor intitute showed.</p>
<p>The monthly survey showed the index fell due to worse expectations among bank managers concerning deposits, credits and the economic situation in the bank's branches after the central bank increased obligatory reserves.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the main causes of the cooler climate...is a negative reaction by banks to higher mandatory reserves,&quot; Eugeniusz Smilowski, Pentor's director told a news conference. @</p>
<p>Smilowski also said that February's dip was partly seasonal and that he expected the index to rise to 49 points in March.</p>
<p>Late last month the central bank said it would increase mandatory reserves on zloty call deposits to 20 percent from 17 and obligatory reserves on foreign currency deposits to four percent from two percent, effective on February 28.</p>
<p>Some 27 percent of bank managers said increased mandatory reserves would cause credit rates to rise, 24 percent expected an increase in credit rates along with a fall in deposit rates, and 13 percent only expected a fall in deposits.</p>
<p>Some 36 percent were not sure of the effect. @</p>
<p>The index, based on a scale of minus 100 to plus 100, rose 11 points to 51.7 in January after a 11 point drop in December and a record high of 52.5 in October 1996.</p>
<p>The Pentor survey, which polled 207 bank managers, is commissioned monthly by the Polish Banking Association (ZBP).</p>
