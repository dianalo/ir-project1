<headline>Mayor of Warren, Mich., charged with assault, bias.</headline>
<dateline>WARREN, Mich. 1996-11-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The mayor of Michigan's third-largest city was arraigned on ethnic intimidation and assault charges Wednesday stemming from his altercation with a black teenager Sept. 11.</p>
<p>Warren Mayor Mark Steenbergh was released on $25,000 personal bond after appearing in 37th District Court to hear the felony ethnic intimidation charge and misdemeanor assault charge filed against him.</p>
<p>Steenbergh, who his white, has acknowledged that he drove to 16-year-old John Harris' neighborhood and confronted the youth after he was told Harris had punched a teenage girl who is a friend of Steenbergh's daughter.</p>
<p>The young man told police Steenburgh choked him, threw him to the grownd and held him. A racial slur was also allegedly used.</p>
<p>Warren, a Detroit suburb with 146,000 residents, is in Macomb County. But Macomb County Prosecutor Carl Marlinga plans to ask St. Clair County prosecutors to handle the matter because he is a long-time friend and supporter of Steenbergh.</p>
<p>Steenbergh could be forced to resign his post if convicted of the felony ethnic intimidation charge, which carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison. The assault and battery charge is punishable by 90 days in jail.</p>
<p>Steenbergh said at a news conference Sept. 13 he would not step down, adding, &quot;I welcome the investigation into this incident. I have nothing to hide.&quot;</p>
