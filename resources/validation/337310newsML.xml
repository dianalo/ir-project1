<p>Russian shares edged down on Tuesday on slim volumes in a correction from recent record highs, and dealers said the market's near-term direction was uncertain.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System (RTS) 24-equity index slipped 3.26 percent to close at 268.37 from Monday's 277.40 on total volumes of $39.9 million, the NAUFOR brokers' association said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to explain what's going on,&quot; said Martin Diggle, director at Brunswick Brokerage. &quot;Today started with about a 3 to 4 percent drop and thin volumes. But in the past few hours it has gone up very strongly.&quot;</p>
<p>Irkutskenergo  rose to $0.259 from Monday's close of $0.246. LUKoil  wavered throughout the day, but was down to $14.10 after $14.17 on Monday.</p>
<p>UES  closed at $0.153, up from $0.150, and Gazprom  slipped to $0.427 after $$0.444.</p>
<p>Operators said President Boris Yeltsin's television appearance on Tuesday afternoon should help boost the market on Wednesday.</p>
<p>An alert Yeltsin, recovering from pneumonia, was shown in a Kremlin meeting, the first new pictures of him since January 6.</p>
<p>&quot;It will certainly help sentiment, but I don't think the correction was triggered by the president's health,&quot; Diggle said.</p>
<p>Dealers said most buyers were Russian, in contrast to the Western funds that drove last week's red-hot buying.</p>
<p>Brokers said shares would be jittery as buyers become accustomed to new, near-record price levels, but said buyers should look forward to a profitable year.</p>
<p>&quot;Gazprom has been cyclical since the years...It was at $0.49, and now is at $.42. I see a lot of Gazprom back orders. I don't see it going below $0.40 again,&quot; said Dan Rapoport, institutional equity sales director at CentreInvest Securities.</p>
<p>Megionneftegaz  rose 7.76 percent to $5.20 from $4.90 after the oil producer announced it planned to issue level-one American Depositary Receipts in the first quarter of this year.</p>
