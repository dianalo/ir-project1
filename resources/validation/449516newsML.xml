<p>India's bowlers need an inspired final day to prevent West Indies grinding their way to an increasingly predictable draw in the second test at Queen's Park Oval.</p>
<p>Monday's fourth day saw a steady home recovery as West Indies, 140 behind on first innings, battled to 118 for one at the close on a slow, low pitch which tested the patience of all involved.</p>
<p>It represented a disappointing day for India who resumed on 367 for three with high hopes of putting the West Indies under pressure in the best-of-five series.</p>
<p>Despite the epic efforts of Navjot Sidhu, who reached 201 to become only the third Indian batsman to take a double hundred off West Indies, the touring team were instead bowled out for 436 by early afternoon.</p>
<p>Sidhu's vigil of more than 11 hours, which included 19 fours and a six, ended when he was bowled by Curtly Ambrose who profited most from the lack of bounce to finish with figures of five for 87.</p>
<p>He was well supported by debutant Mervyn Dillon who took three for 92, including the wickets of Abey Kuruvilla and Venhatesh Prasad with consecutive deliveries.</p>
<p>It left the Indians on 420 for nine at lunch but Anil Kumble, who retired hurt after being struck a painful blow in the groin by Dillon, returned after the interval to help his side add a further 16 runs.</p>
<p>Kuruvilla soon made a much-needed breakthrough in West Indies' second innings by removing Sherwin Campbell lbw for four with the score on 25 but it was to prove a solitary success.</p>
<p>Stuart Williams and Shivnarine Chanderpaul survived the odd moment of alarm against Kumble in an unbroken second wicket stand of 93 and Williams took the opportunity to register only his second test fifty.</p>
<p>It was scarcely a spectacular effort, occupying 201 minutes and 142 balls, but it ensured West Indies ended the day just 22 runs behind and in a much less precarious position than they might have feared.</p>
<p>Chanderpaul, whose fine diving catch in the covers to remove Saurav Ganguly started the Indian slump, was unbeaten on 39 at the close, allowing fellow left-hander Brian Lara to preserve his energy for the final day.</p>
