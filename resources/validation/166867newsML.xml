<p>French President Jacques Chirac sent a get-well-soon message to Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday and got a telephone update on the Russian President's heart surgery from Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>In a message addressed to &quot;Mr President, Dear Boris&quot;, Chirac said: &quot;I was very pleased to learn that your operation took place in the best conditions&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I send you my warmest wishes for a quick recovery and hope you have a very good convalescence,&quot; Chirac said in the message, released by his office. He said he hoped to have &quot;the pleasure&quot; of talking to Yeltsin soon.</p>
<p>Chirac's office said Chernomyrdin, acting head of state in Yeltsin's absence, called Chirac to brief him on Yeltsin's multiple bypass operation. The Kremlin said the seven-hour surgery was successful.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Chernomyrdin gave the president good news about the health of Mr Yeltsin,&quot; a French official said. &quot;The president said he was very happy to see that Mr Yeltsin had overcome his medical difficulties.&quot;</p>
<p>Chirac asked Chernomyrdin &quot;to pass on his most friendly greetings to President Yeltsin and also asked him to pass on his warmest congratulations to all members of the medical team,&quot; the French official said.</p>
<p>Chirac and Chernomyrdin are due to meet on November 26 in Paris.</p>
