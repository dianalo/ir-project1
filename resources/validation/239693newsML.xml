<title>LITHUANIA: Lithuania litas to ease as dlr peg ends - Deutsche.</title>
<headline>Lithuania litas to ease as dlr peg ends - Deutsche.</headline>
<dateline>VILNIUS 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Leading German bank Deutsche Bank on Friday forecast only a slight depreciation in the Lithuanian currency if the Balic state carries out its plan to unpeg its litas unit from the dollar.</p>
<p>But Deutsche sounded a note of caution over possible future exchange rate speculation although it noted that local financial markets were calm.</p>
<p>The new right-wing government of Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius has pledged to set up a freely-floating currency regime for the litas no earlier than 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;As a working hypothesis we assume the peg to the USD will be abolished in roughly six months and there will be a managed floating as a result of which the litas will depreciate slightly against the USD,&quot; Deutsche said in a research note on Lithuania.</p>
<p>The litas is set at four to one dollar. It is controlled by a currency board, by which the central bank has to hold enough reserves in its vaults to back the litas at the pegged rate.</p>
<p>But the central bank is also reduced to a shadow of the normal central bank and has no control of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Vagnorius said he wanted to end the peg at the start of next year but backtracked after a mini-run on the litas.</p>
<p>Deutsche said Lithuanian financial markets were not currently showing too many worries over the ending of the peg.</p>
<p>&quot;The exchange rate speculation and with it the danger of the reemergence of an exchange rate risk has not been reflected in the development of interest rates in recent months,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It said that rates on the domestic T-bill market have continued to fall due to lower government demand for cash.</p>
<p>&quot;Renewed exchange rate speculation with a corresponding impact on interest rates cannot however be ruled out as the decoupling of the litas from the US dollar approaches,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The bank also said the new government should take more advantage of its low external debt to make more borrowings abroad to fund what is likely to be a growing trade deficit but that the export sector should also be strengthened.</p>
