<headline>Dlr retains gains vs mark, yen in US after Rubin.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-31</dateline>

<p>The dollar rose against the German mark and the Japanese yen on Thursday amid fresh signs of healthy U.S. economic growth coupled with scant evidence of looming inflation.</p>
<p>The dollar, which had already trimmed its overnight losses, took off on news that the U.S. Gross Domestic Product was up 2.2 percent in the second quarter versus up 4.9 percent in January-March. The GDP's inflation components fell.</p>
<p>&quot;Fundamentally the data were very good with very low inflation,&quot; said Tom Benfer, director of foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal.</p>
<p>The dollar got an added boost in late trading from U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin who reiterated his support of a strong dollar which helps keep inflation low.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always said we believe a strong dollar is in our interest,&quot; Rubin told Reuters in an interview while adding it was unclear whether demand in Japan was helping the expansion.</p>
<p>Commenting on Thailand's economic crisis that weakened its currency, the baht, Rubin said the United States backs the International Monetary Fund's efforts to help that country.</p>
<p>But he stressed this would not require any U.S. aid as did the Mexican financial crisis in 1995.</p>
<p>In late trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8375/85 marks versus 1.8315/25 at the open, and at 118.60/70 yen vs. 118.15/25.</p>
<p>Some dollar/yen volatility resulted from further apparent disagreement between U.S. and Japanese carmakers regarding appropriate exchange rate levels.</p>
<p>A senior official at the Japanese Automobile Manufacturer's Association said a dollar above 120 yen would cause concern in his industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Everytime we get close to 120 that's going to resurrect the trade issue,&quot; acknowledged Bank of Montreal's Benfer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, American Automobile Manufacturer Association (AAMA) President Andrew Card presented a very different view, saying the yen was too weak and should be at 95.00/105.00.</p>
<p>Incidents of official jawboning have increased in recent days, along with the dollar's latest push to a 2-1/2-month high of 118.95 yen on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Separately, traders said players were not eager to set up long dollar positions ahead of the July employment report.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just exhaustion, but the dollar is poised very nicely going into tomorrow,&quot; said Kevin Lawrie, global foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank.</p>
<p>Lawrie did not expect the employment data to deliver the kind of &quot;surprises that would get Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to change his outlook on rates.&quot;</p>
<p>In a Reuters survey, the consensus calls for payroll increase of 193,000 in July versus 217,000 in June, while the unemployment rate would edge down 0.1 percent to 4.9 percent.</p>
<p>Jobs data have been the focus of Wall Street lately due to fears that tight labor markets would drive wages higher, fuel inflation, and prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten credit.</p>
<p>U.S. stocks and bonds are pricey and would be vulnerable to any rate hike which may hurt the dollar, traders said.</p>
<p>A rebound in sterling/mark helped dollar/mark. Meanwhile, the mark/yen recovery continued, contributing to dollar/yen's gains, traders said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the dollar could retest on Friday 119.00 yen, a key resistance level, and 1.8490 marks, the highest level since November 1989 made on Monday.</p>
<p>The dollar closed at 1.5115/25 Swiss francs vs. 1.5090/00 at the open, in a range between a high of 1.5262 and a low of 1.5076. It ended at Canadian $1.3780/85 vs. C$1.3804/09.</p>
<p>Cable ended at $1.6400/07 vs. $1.6398/08 while the Australian dollar finished at $0.7475/80 vs. $0.7432/37.</p>
