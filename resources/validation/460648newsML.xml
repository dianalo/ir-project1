<headline>Allied pilots' board meets on new American offer.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-03-21</dateline>

<p>The board of the Allied Pilots Association started meeting on Friday to consider whether to support a new contract offer by American Airlines and settle a bitter labour dispute with the country's No.2 carrier.</p>
<p>But even if the 18-member board backs the preliminary agreement reached on Wednesday, it must still be ratified by the APA's 9,300 pilots, which proved a stumbling block to an earlier attempt to settle with American, a unit of AMR Corp. .  </p>
<p>The negotiating committee started briefing the Board on the tentative contract reached with the airline,  pilots union spokesman Matthew Field said. &quot;Yeah, they've started,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>An accord reached last September got the backing of the board by 10-8, but 61 percent of the pilots turned it down.</p>
<p>Union officials say the pilots are ready to strike on April 28 if no new agreement is reached, with the critical issues being pay and the right to fly the new small jets American plans to buy.</p>
<p>The pilots briefly went on strike at midnight on Feb. 14, but President Clinton immediately set up an emergency board, which sent the pilots back to work for 60 days while mediators drafted a proposed settlement.</p>
