<p>Firebrand leader Umberto Bossi will try to breathe new life into Italy's flagging Northern League when he pitches for endorsement of his separatist agenda at a party congress this weekend.</p>
<p>But many wonder whether the man who has been the scourge of Italy's south, which he calls corrupt and mafia-ridden, has lost his touch.</p>
<p>The League, which rose to prominence on a wave of public disgust with political corruption, won a solid eight percent of votes at a general election last April on a federalist platform built to appeal to Italians in the affluent north.</p>
<p>But a declaration of independence for the movement's self-styled northern &quot;republic of Padania&quot; fell flat last September, suggesting Bossi had misjudged the popular mood.</p>
<p>&quot;The political leadership is in trouble and there is no great sense of initiative,&quot; said political commentator Gianfranco Pasquino. &quot;They have not recovered from the September (independence) declaration which was a failure.&quot;</p>
<p>Since then Bossi, a master at grabbing headlines, has found it a struggle to draw media attention. His attempts to seize the initiative have either flopped or made only a small ripple.</p>
<p>The League made an abortive attempt in October to frustrate passage of the 1997 budget by presenting 1,800 amendments.</p>
<p>Last week the party pulled out of a new parliamentary commission on constitutional reform because the body was not prepared to give its proposals to split the country a hearing. The commission will go ahead regardless.</p>
<p>Nonetheless Bossi's verbal barbs against the political establishment in Rome have lost none of their sting.</p>
<p>&quot;I would be wary of saying the League is in decline,&quot; said Renato Mannheimer, a polling expert based in Milan. &quot;Bossi's style is to make sure he appears in the papers and to show he is different. He then reaps the benefit at election time.&quot;</p>
<p>Bossi continues to play on deep-seated resentment in the north, particularly among the self-employed, with high taxes, inefficient social services and a remote bureacracy in Rome.</p>
<p>Asked in a recent newspaper interview whether he intended to invite representatives of Italy's other major political parties to the three-day League congress, which opens in Milan on Friday, Bossi gave a characteristically scathing reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Invite the leaders of the other parties? For the love of God they are Italians. If they were to come we would have to watch our wallets,&quot; Bossi told Milan's Corriere della Sera.</p>
<p>He said he is sticking unswervingly to his separatist message, which he embraced last year after ditching federalism.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in no doubt that independence will save Padania and will also save the south,&quot; said Bossi.</p>
<p>Irene Pivetti, a former leader of the movement who was expelled last year for dissent, said she believed Bossi's decision to adopt the cause of separatism had sealed his fate.</p>
<p>&quot;The beginning of the end for Bossi has been the decision to pursue secession,&quot; said Pivetti, who served as speaker of the lower house of parliament from 1994 to 1996.</p>
<p>But so long as Italy's main political parties failed to reform the country's creaking state machinery there was space for Bossi to make political capital, Pivetti said.</p>
<p>&quot;From his point of view there is room (to manoeuvre). As long as the state is not reformed there is room,&quot; Pivetti told Reuters.</p>
