<p>British investment bank BZW on Thursday showed it had gone some way to recovering from a poor showing in the second half of 1996, despite a 20 million pound ($32 million) derivatives loss.</p>
<p>Its parent Barclays Plc revealed it had made an operating profit of 124 million pounds for the first six months of 1997, a sharp recovery from the second half of 1996 but still short of the 148 million pound profit for same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Bill Harrison, BZW's chief executive, told Reuters BZW's recovery has if anything &quot;a bit ahead of schedule&quot; and he was not disappointed by the figures.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no short term fixes in this business. You have got to put in place what you think is a firm foundation for the future,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Barclays' admission BZW had lost money as a result of mis-judging the British stock market ahead of the May election and the Labour government's first budget early in July followed intense market speculation BZW had sustained significant losses.</p>
<p>&quot;In the context of what was swirling around the market place, I was pleased that we actually came up front with that. There were some very wild stories flogging around,&quot; Harrison said.</p>
<p>But he declined to comment on the exact size of a second equity derivatives loss, which followed the budget, except to say it was &quot;smaller&quot; than the 20 million pounds already accounted for.</p>
<p>Harrison said the loss was directly related to uncertainty over ACT (Advance Corporation Tax) and had occurred on BZW's long-term FTSE index book.</p>
<p>BZW has come under intense scrutiny over the 16 months since the death of its previous chief executive David Band in March 1996. Harrison was poached from British independent investment bank Robert Fleming and took over the reins in September of last year.</p>
<p>He immediately began a major overhaul of the business, resulting in the departure of many old hands and the arrival of a new breed of managers, including the widely-respected Bob Diamond from CSFB.</p>
<p>But the hiring and firing has been a costly exercise and has at times given the impression of a merry-go-round.</p>
<p>Some of this movement can be put down to a generally fluid jobs market in the City but many old-hands appear to have left the firm disgruntled while others have not welcomed a move to the Canary Wharf development in London's Docklands.</p>
<p>Harrison said the move, which brings all BZW's business under one roof, had gone well and was two-thirds completed. But he admitted the move and the restructuring of BZW had been a challenge.</p>
<p>A recurring rumour this year has centred on the possibility of Barclays either gearing up to sell BZW or to spin it off as a free-standing investment bank.</p>
<p>But Barclays' chief executive Martin Taylor told Reuters on Thursday the bank had no intention of selling BZW, a line he and chairman Andrew Buxton have always maintained.</p>
<p>BZW's total income for the first six months was 692 million pounds, this was 13 percent ahead of the previous six months and six percent ahead of the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>Harrison said BZW had gone some way to addressing one of its biggest challenges, revitalising its markets business. This had been a big weakness and needed to be improved, with encouraging results.</p>
<p>He said the division was gelling well internally and with BZW's other arms, an integral part of his belief that integration was crucial to success.</p>
<p>While Harrison was keen to point out BZW has &quot;a useful pipeline of business going forward&quot;, fees and commissions for the period of 220 million pounds were in line with the second half of 1996 but below the 275 million pounds achieved in the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>Costs of 561 million pounds were similar to the second half of 1996 and reflected the continued commitment to a programme of upgrading people and systems, BZW said.</p>
<p>Harrison said there was still upgrading to be done, particularly of IT. While encouraged by what had so far been achieved, however, he stressed &quot;you can never relax&quot;.</p>
<p>And he could not guarantee there would not be further movement of personnel, given the fluid nature of the business and the amount of choice available.</p>
<p>But the people hired over the last year at BZW were now acknowledged to be very good, not only as role models but for their positive impact on the business, Harrison said.</p>
