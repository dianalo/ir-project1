<p>Italy said on Monday the privatisation of telecoms holding Stet would be postponed to late 1997 and that Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi had instructed state holding company IRI to merge Stet with telephone operator Telecom Italia.</p>
<p>The Treasury issued a statement after a meeting between Ciampi and Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert in Brussels.  </p>
<p>The statement said Van Miert was disappointed at the delay in the Stet sell-off, initially due by March 31 next year, and had insisted that Stet shares be transferred as soon as possible from IRI to the Treasury.</p>
<p>The statement also said that Italy expected the sale of yellow-pages publisher Seat to proceed in early 1997 and that of motorway company Autostrade to go ahead by June next year.</p>
<p>The Stet sale is conditional on the creation of a telecommunications watchdog to oversee the privatised sector. Approval has been held up for months in parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;The present stage of the parliamentary debate...rules out a possibility to privatise by March 1997. Realistically this has to be postponed to the autumn of 1997,&quot; the statement quoted Ciampi as saying.  </p>
<p>The statement said Stet shares should be transferred to the Treasury from IRI, which would also take up some of IRI's debt, to ease the heavily-indebted holding company's position during the transition to the Stet sale.</p>
<p>It did not specify how much IRI debt would be taken up.</p>
<p>The statement also said IRI had also been instructed to sell off either controlling or minority stakes such as those in navigation group FINMARE and in Banca di Roma.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Van Miert welcomed the progress acheived by the Italian government on the privatisation front and took note with satisfaction of its plans for IRI's asset sales in 1997,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Van Miert however expressed his deep regret that the privatisation of Stet is not taking place within the foreseen schedule, i.e. the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore he insisted that privatisation of Stet should take place rapidly anyway and that in the meantime and in any case as early as possible Stet shares be transferred from IRI to the Treasury,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>It quoted Ciampi as saying the government would decide on the issue during &quot;the next few days&quot;.</p>
