<p>South Africa planned to set up a one-stop information centre in a bid to attract local and foreign investment in mining, Minerals and Energy department promotion chief director Nchakha Maloi said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Maloi told the National Council of Province's economics and foreign affairs committee that the main motivation was the fact that mining's contribution to state revenue had fallen from 12 percent to 1.6 percent while employment had plunged from more than 800,000 to just over 100,000.</p>
<p>This was despite South Africa's vast mineral wealth and the lack of new development could partly be attributed to the fact that information about mineral resources was scattered in various institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;This is also intended to promote investment in state-owned mineral rights,&quot; Maloi said.</p>
<p>The one problem with this would be the fact that there was no clear picture of the extent of state-owned minerals, although it was suspected to be about a third of all mineral rights.</p>
<p>&quot;The one-stop service is also intended to resolve that problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The service would be allied to an investment promotion strategy to attract both local and foreign investors.</p>
<p>Other priority areas this year included promoting the beneficiation of raw materials and legalising and regulating small scale mining, which could have adverse environmental effects if left unchecked.</p>
<p>Some of the more controversial issues being examined included whether or not there should be a mineral rights tax and an investigation into the extent of transfer pricing in the mining industry.</p>
<p>He said views on these were deeply divided and the pros and cons had to be carefully considered.</p>
<p>Maloi said the department was also considering the introduction of an early warning system to monitor marginal mines that would need downscaling so that it could take action on time to reduce the impact.</p>
<p>It had also started an audit of mineral leases on state-owned mineral rights to ensure that royalties due were being paid.</p>
<p>&quot;Towards the end of last year we started this and we managed to recover about 15 million rands,&quot; he said.</p>
