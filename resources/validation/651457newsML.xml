<p>--------------------------(JUNE 10)-----------------------------</p>
<p>* NZ yields rise further at close in face of weak TWI</p>
<p>* Higher U.S. yields rub off onto local market</p>
<p>* Dealers remain glued to screens for any RBNZ statement</p>
<p>New Zealand debt softened further during Tuesday's session, with the 90-day bank bills weakening five basis points to 7.12 percent in the face of a soft currency Trade-Weighted Index (TWI).</p>
<p>The TWI, which shed around 20 points on Monday, lost another seven on Tuesday to close at 67.17.  </p>
<p>The June futures contract finished four basis points weaker at 92.90 ahead of its close-out on Wednesday, with 1,999 contracts traded. Volumes were very strong in its successor -- the September contract -- which was down eight to 92.90 and saw 2,379 contracts traded.</p>
<p>&quot;There is good volume pretty much wherever you go. Three or four points away from the previous night's closes (the) good bids or offers start to stack up,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile bond yields also rose in line with U.S. Treasuries, with the 02/00 maturity up six pips to 7.02 percent and the 11/06 up seven to 7.28 percent.  </p>
<p>The Reuters Monetary Conditions Index fell through -1.0 again during the session, meaning conditions were more than 100 basis points (in interest rate terms) easier than the Reserve Bank's desired level. The index came back to end at 0.99.</p>
<p>Dealers said they were keeping a nervous eye out for any ticking off from the Reserve Bank, but the market seemed happy to hold conditions 100 points too easy.</p>
<p>&quot;If it goes too much further I'm not sure -- I would imagine they (the Reserve Bank) are more likely to say something just on a technical basis rather than let it run,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>He predicted conditions would remain at current levels until the RBNZ monetary policy statement on June 27, but added that most people saw interest rates heading lower in the longer term.</p>
<p>&quot;The general position does seem to be that once the statement is out of the way, if they were to condone maybe a 75 point easing (from the conditions they assumed in March) or even out to 100 where we're sitting now, then interest rates could go another 50 or 60 points,&quot; he said.</p>
