<title>USA: Mississippi judge may drop out of tobacco case.</title>
<headline>Mississippi judge may drop out of tobacco case.</headline>
<dateline>LAUREL, Miss 1997-04-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Mississippi state judge in a $650 million wrongful death case is weighing a tobacco industry request that he step down after twice meeting a plaintiff attorney without the presence of a full contingent of tobacco lawyers.</p>
<p>Circuit Court Judge Joe Landrum, who has presided over the case since it was filed in 1994, gave no timetable for a ruling after a hearing on Tuesday. No ruling had been issued on Wednesday, a Jones County court official in Laurel said.  </p>
<p>Tobacco lawyers said the meetings held in late March were improper and raised questions about Landrum's impartiality.</p>
<p>Gloria Butler Baldwin, a member of the family that filed the suit, said the request for the judge to step down was a tactic to delay the trial, which is scheduled to begin August 18.</p>
<p>The case is part of a broad legal and regulatory assault on U.S. cigarette makers. The family's lawsuit claims that the death of Burl Butler, a Laurel barber who did not smoke, was caused by decades of exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke in his shop.  </p>
<p>A plaintiff lawyer called by tobacco attorneys at Tuesday's hearing said the meetings with Landrum revolved around the receipt of papers from Liggett Group, a cigarette maker, for possible use at the trial.</p>
<p>The judge summoned plaintiff lawyer Cynthia Langston and Thomas Cook, a lawyer for Liggett, to ensure that all the documents were in place, Langston said.  </p>
<p>The papers are still largely secret and were made available to anti-tobacco lawyers by Liggett, a unit of Brooke Group Ltd, as part of a settlement with state attorneys general suing tobacco companies to recover government costs in treating people with smoking-related illnesses. The agreement made Liggett a pariah among tobacco companies, even as it continues to defend itself with other cigarette makers in smoking-related lawsuits.</p>
<p>Anti-tobacco lawyers say the papers show an industry conspiracy to hide the dangers of smoking.  </p>
<p>Cook, the Liggett lawyer, said he met the judge delivering copies of the Liggett documents on March 20 and again on March 24, when he checked at the judge's request that all the papers were there. Cook said he felt no obligation to tell the other tobacco defendants of the meetings.</p>
<p>&quot;The judge is accused of having ex parte communications with the plaintiffs,&quot; Langston said on Wednesday. &quot;That simply is not the case, since Liggett has not settled (with us) and is still a defendant.&quot;</p>
<p>An appeal of the judge's ruling is highly likely.</p>
