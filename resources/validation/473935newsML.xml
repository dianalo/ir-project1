<p>No place has seemed safe enough for Gottfried Wagner -- the great-grandson of the 19th century German composer Richard Wagner -- since he started giving lectures in Israel denouncing his family for their &quot;unrepentant anti-Semitism&quot; and close friendship with Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p>He has been subjected to death threats in Germany, blacklisted by Swiss-based right-wing extremists and his music seminars in U.S. universities have been disrupted by heckling neo-Nazis denouncing him as a &quot;traitor&quot;.</p>
<p>Some of Wagner's Israeli hosts asked him to speak from behind a bullet-proof screen in case of extremist attacks, he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He declined this offer and that of a bullet-proof vest, but the music colleges nonetheless hired security guards.</p>
<p>Wagner's talks focus on the music festival which his great-grandfather founded in 1876 in the Bavarian town of Bayreuth, and which he argues became the cultural centre for Hitler's Third Reich because of its history of deeply-rooted anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>After World War Two the Wagner family relaunched a new &quot;de-politicised Bayreuth&quot; which has become one of Germany's most elegant society venues, hosting a cult festival that draws thousands of Wagnerians every year.</p>
<p>But in a new book 50-year-old Gottfried argues that his family, who have run the festival since the composer's death in 1883, have never faced up fully to their dark past and still refuse to for fear of scaring off sponsors and harming a lucrative business.</p>
<p>He says the festival should be more critical of Richard Wagner's epic works depicting Germanic legends, which Hitler used to support his vision of Aryan supremacy.</p>
<p>NEW BOOK REVEALS WAGNER FAMILY'S &quot;DARK PAST&quot;</p>
<p>In &quot;He who does not howl with the wolf&quot;, launched last month in Frankfurt, Wagner recalls an unhappy childhood after World War Two and the &quot;traumatic experience&quot; of discovering just how closely his family were involved with Hitler's Third Reich.</p>
<p>He says that Hitler proposed marrige to his grandmother and that his father, Wolfgang Wagner, 77, who has run the festival since the late 1960s, regarded the Nazi leader as a &quot;substitute father&quot;.</p>
<p>Some critics say the book has little new to offer about Richard Wagner's well documented anti-Semitism and Bayreuth's dark past. Others have dismissed it as &quot;fanatical self-analysis&quot;.</p>
<p>But the publishers describe it an important work bound to cause controversy -- and sure enough its publication has fuelled a family feud.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Wagner said it was a subjective book which contained factual errors, and attacked one passage depicting him as a closet anti-Semite as &quot;libellous&quot;.</p>
<p>A festival spokeswoman said Wolfgang Wagner was not ruling out suing his son over the offending passages.</p>
<p>Hitler saw himself as Richard Wagner's cultural heir and tried to achieve in politics what Wagner had strived for in art -- a pure Germanic form &quot;uncontaminated by Judaic ideas&quot; outlined in his notorious anti-Semitic pamphlet &quot;Judaism in Music&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bayreuth festival was founded as a strongly anti-Semitic counter-cultural centre against Paris and the opera of (Jewish composer) Giacomo Meyerbeer,&quot; Gottfried said.</p>
<p>&quot;When Hitler wrote his manifesto 'Mein Kampf' he mentioned very few people. One of them, a very important influence on him, was my great-grandfather. The first time Hitler came to Bayreuth was on a pilgrimage and he wept at the foot of Wagner's grave.&quot;</p>
<p>Hitler went to Bayreuth to visit the composer's son-in-law, the English philosopher Houston Chamberlain, whose racist texts helped him form his theory of an Aryan super race.</p>
<p>Hitler also met the composer's English daughter-in-law Winifred in the early 1920s and became a regular guest at the Villa Wahnfried, the Wagner family home.</p>
<p>After his first visit to Israel in 1990, Gottfried Wagner fell out with his father, who banned him from Bayreuth.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was growing up, the Nazi past was taboo and my father did not want to talk about it. My disagreement with him is that the moment Hitler entered Villa Wahnfried it became public and part of German history,&quot; Gottfried Wagner said.</p>
<p>Winifred was one of the first Nazi party members and became a devoted activist. When Hitler, to whom she was sexually attracted, was jailed in 1924 she smuggled in Wahnfried headed writing paper on which he wrote &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.</p>
<p>In his book Wagner recalls how even after the war she remained a diehard Nazi, inviting the wives of convicted Nazi war criminals for tea, and how as late as the 1970s she declared her undying devotion to the Fuehrer in a television interview:</p>
<p>&quot;If Hitler were to walk through the door today, I would be just as glad to see him as I ever was,&quot; he quoted Winifred as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;She opened the doors of German high society for him (Hitler),&quot; Gottfried Wagner said of his grandmother. &quot;Before, he was an outsider, a radical. She was absolutely convinced this was the future leader, the redeemer of Germany.&quot;</p>
<p>Wagner says his family tried to conceal their Nazi ties by hiding old film reels of Hitler's visits to Bayreuth, and is convinced they destroyed documents linking them to the Third Reich which he argues belong in the public domain.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to open up a dialogue, to stop the falsification and repression of the past. This is a very dark family tradition and I'm not proud of it.&quot;</p>
