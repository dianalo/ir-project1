<title>UK: LIFFE coffee ends off lows after sellers withdraw.</title>
<headline>LIFFE coffee ends off lows after sellers withdraw.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Robusta coffee futures came under pressure all day but ended off lows after origin sellers retreated from falling prices, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The general perception of the market is not very friendly,&quot; one said, referring to sentiment that further falls are likely.</p>
<p>But a better-than-expected performance from the New York market helped LIFFE futures to recoup some of their losses later on.</p>
<p>Origin sellers moved to lock in prices in early trading, but pulled back later in response to lower prices, traders said.</p>
<p>Part of the market's weakness was a result of the expectation that New York would fall sharply, traders said. &quot;But in the event it held on a bit,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Arabica futures were mostly firmer in rangebound dealings earely in the session, as a round of local short-covering erased early losses.</p>
<p>London traders were satisfied with the total LIFFE volume. &quot;It's not too bad in recent terms,&quot; one said. &quot;A fair amount of switch activity has boosted volume,&quot; he said. Total volume was 6,067 lots.</p>
<p>Front month January last traded at $1,323, down $16, having reached a low of $1,316 earlier in the day. Volume for January was 2,703 lots.</p>
<p>March, the most active month, last traded $20 lower at $1,272, having seen a low of $1,268. March volume was 2,772 lots.</p>
