<p>Israel and the PLO have removed the main obstacle to a deal on the West Bank town of Hebron, Israeli and Palestinian officials said after a lightning mediation mission to Gaza and Tel Aviv by Jordan's King Hussein.</p>
<p>Both sides agreed on Sunday to compromise on mid-1998 for the completion of three Israeli troop withdrawals from mostly rural areas of the West Bank, the officials said.</p>
<p>A timeframe for the pullbacks, originally scheduled to be completed by September this year, has been the main stumbling block to sealing a deal on implementing a long overdue Israeli troop redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>&quot;King Hussein, U.S. envoy Dennis Ross and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu telephoned Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and told him Netanyahu has accepted the formula,&quot; said a PLO official who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>&quot;I think because of the important initiative that His Majesty took we have made considerable progress and I think we can envision the end of the negotiations in sight,&quot; Netanyahu said after meeting the monarch late on Sunday.</p>
<p>Israeli and Palestinians negotiators planned to meet in Jerusalem on Monday to work out the final details and a summit between Netanyahu and Arafat could be held within 48 hours, officials from both sides said.</p>
<p>The PLO had been reluctant to sign an accord on Hebron, where some 400 Jewish settlers live amid more than 100,000 Palestinians, without a commitment from Israel to carry out the additional West Bank pullbacks agreed in previous peace deals.</p>
<p>Israel had proposed to complete the West Bank pullbacks by May 1999 and the United States has suggested mid-1998. The PLO had demanded Israel stick to a peace deal under which the withdrawals were to have been completed by September this year.</p>
<p>King Hussein discussed the mid-1998 compromise during talks earlier on Sunday in Gaza with Arafat and by telephone with Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak. The king then flew to Tel Aviv to see Netanyahu.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there was significant progress on the subjects that are not connected with Hebron,&quot; Netanyahu said in a clear reference to the three West Bank pullbacks.</p>
<p>&quot;As you know, the Hebron agreement is effectively complete and this evening, I think with the important help of King Hussein, we have made another advance,&quot; Netanyahu told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still details which we have to care of. With the help and goodwill of all the sides, Jordan and Egypt, I believe we can complete the negotiations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A PLO official said Israel and the Palestinians had agreed to start the first of the three West Bank rural redeployments on February 28.</p>
<p>King Hussein told the Tel Aviv news conference: &quot;I believe...we are on the verge of the completion of a long road and as far as I'm concerned, I leave here confident that everything will move in the right direction.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, who had planned to return home on Sunday after the latest three-week round of talks, said President Bill Clinton had asked him to remain in the region &quot;because of the progress that was made today&quot;.</p>
