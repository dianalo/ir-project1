<p>Seton Hall University named young Duke assistant Tommy Amaker as the successor to fired head coach George Blaney on Wednesday in a guaranteed six-year deal worth a reported $350,000 per season.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old Amaker was an assistant coach at Duke under Mike Krzyzewski the last nine seasons and served as an associate head coach the last two seasons.</p>
<p>University President Monsignor Robert T. Sheeran said the decision to hire Amaker, who became available when the Blue Devils were eliminated from the NCAA Tournament on Sunday with a loss to Providence, did not take long.</p>
<p>&quot;Within two hours of shaking hands, I was convinced he was the right man at the right time for Seton Hall,&quot; Sheeran said.</p>
<p>Amaker, who has no previous head coaching experience, was the starting point guard at Duke for four seasons (1984-87) and led the team to a Final Four appearance as a junior, when the Duke lost to Louisville in the 1986 championship game.</p>
<p>During his overall tenure as a player and coach, Duke went to the Final Four five times and won two national titles.</p>
<p>Amaker was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in 1987, but was cut in training camp and returned to Duke to pursue a graduate degree.</p>
<p>&quot;I had one of the best assistant jobs in the country,&quot; Amaker said. &quot;I've had the opportunity to move on before, but nothing as unique as Seton Hall.&quot;</p>
<p>Seton Hall dismissed Blaney on March 10 after the school's first back-to-back losing seasons in a decade.</p>
<p>Blaney came to Seton Hall in 1994 after 22 seasons as head coach at Holy Cross. He took over for P.J. Carlesimo, who led the Pirates to the 1989 NCAA Championship game.</p>
