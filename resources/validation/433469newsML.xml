<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets were at a standstill for most of Tuesday, with extremely light sales reported late at $68.00 per cwt, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>One pen, or about 200 heifers, that will likely grade select and choice sold at $68.00 in the Texas Panhandle, steady with last week, USDA said. There were no sales reported in Kansas.</p>
<p>Packer buyers and cattle owners were at a stalemate most of the day, with bids at $65.00-$66.00 passed by owners pricing cattle at $69.00-$70.00, the feedlot sources said.  </p>
<p>Prices were expected to be underpinned by expectations that packers would be in the market Wednesday or Thursday to refresh live cattle inventories, they said.</p>
<p>The demand for cattle was expected to offset possible pressure from increased showlist supplies this week, cattle sources said.  The lists were expanded by a carryover of unsold cattle from last week, sources said.</p>
<p>Support in fed cattle prices could be limited, however, if beef values continue to weaken. Heavyweight choice beef at midday was quoted at $104.92, down $1.05 per cwt from Monday and down $2.87 from last Tuesday, USDA statistics showed.</p>
