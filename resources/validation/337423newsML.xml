<title>RUSSIA: Pragmatic Maskhadov makes unlikely Chechen leader.</title>
<headline>Pragmatic Maskhadov makes unlikely Chechen leader.</headline>
<dateline>GROZNY, Russia 1997-01-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Aslan Maskhadov, who was heading for victory in Chechnya's presidential election on Tuesday, seems an unlikely president among a people known for fiery pride and a love of weapons.</p>
<p>A modest man who swapped camouflage fatigues for a suit and tie during the election campaign, Maskhadov, 45, was commander of Chechnya's guerrillas during the 21-month war against Russian troops who swept into the tiny region in 1994.</p>
<p>His determined rag-tag army outwitted Russia's ill-trained forces.</p>
<p>Russian troops took the capital Grozny early in the war. But Maskhadov's guerrillas kept striking time after time, and Russia was forced to pull its soldiers out.</p>
<p>Early in the war, Chechens grew used to Maskhadov's nightly briefings on televison broadcasts from the ground floor of the presidential palace, the centre of rebel resistance, in which he offered the Chechen view of news from the front.</p>
<p>As the bloody conflict came to an end he led peace talks with Russian officials and, quietly, calmly and pragmatically, steered the Caucasus region to what he describes as de facto independence.</p>
<p>Moscow insists Chechnya remains in the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Many in the Kremlin see Maskhadov as the most acceptable of major Chechen political figures that it may have to deal with in future talks to resolve relations with Grozny.</p>
<p>His task now will be to rebuild Chechnya, much of which was devastated in the fighting.</p>
<p>Maskhadov was born in Kazakhstan, a member of one of tens of thousands of families exiled to the remote steppelands in 1944 by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who accused the Chechen people of collaberating wwith Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>He is married and has a son and a daughter.</p>
<p>During the campaign for president of Chechnya, Maskhadov, like the other 15 candidates, invoked the name of the late separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev and stressed a need for Islamic values in the region, which had a population of about a million before the war began.</p>
<p>He shares with Dudayev a career as a high-ranking officer in the Soviet army, in which he was an artillery colonel.</p>
<p>This was rare for ethnic Chechens, who were not viewed in the Soviet system as politically reliable enough for leading military positions.</p>
<p>But similarities between Maskhadov and the volatile Dudayev end there.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Dudayev) was rigid and loved emotion, while I always said we shouldn't rush to war. But on the question of Chechen independence, I don't differ one iota from him.  We are a sovereign state,&quot; Maskhadov told Reuters recently.</p>
