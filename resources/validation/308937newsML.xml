<p>Spot bulk electricity prices in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) were mostly steady Wednesday although sources said talk of a unit outage pushed weekend discussion higher.</p>
<p>ERCOT firm, peak power for a 16-hour block for Thursday delivery was discussed steady at $37.00-41.00 per megawatt hour (MWh), the brokers and marketers said.</p>
<p>ERCOT non-firm peak power was talked at $33.00-35.00 per MWh, the sources said.</p>
<p>Firm peak power for weekend delivery was said to be offered as high as $55.00 per MWh, pushed up by a cold Saturday and Sunday forecast and talk of a possible weekend generation unit outage, sources said.</p>
<p>However, a weekend Texas outage was not confirmed.</p>
<p>Texas Utilities said its nuclear plants were at full operation with no weekend outages expected. Houston Light and Power would not comment on the status of its generation plants or the possibility of a weekend outage.</p>
<p>Firm off-peak ERCOT deliveries for Thursday were talked steady at $24.50-28.50 per MWh.</p>
<p>February ERCOT peak power was said to have been talked over a wide range of $33.00-36.00, while August ERCOT peak power was talked higher at $26.00-26.25 from $25.50-26.00 per MWh on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Temperatures in Texas were expected to drop late Thursday and through Friday to 12 to 24 degrees Fahrenheit below normal with some moderation through the weekend and early next week.</p>
