<p>Sara Lee Corp, which named a president and vice chairman Thursday, is laying the groundwork for a successor to Chairman John Bryan, analysts said.</p>
<p>The food and consumer products company appointed C. Steven McMillan to the post of president and Donald Franceschini as vice chairman in a move the company said would begin an orderly management transition for the short and long terms.</p>
<p>&quot;They've been right below Bryan for some time now, and they've both done incredible jobs for Sara Lee,&quot; Sally Schaadt, an analyst at Fourteen Research, said.  </p>
<p>Several industry analysts praised the jobs McMillan and Franceschini have done in the food and personal products operations, respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;Both have good track records and both are held in high regard,&quot; Ellen Baras, an analyst at Nesbitt Burns, said.</p>
<p>&quot;McMillan is clearly being tested,&quot; she added. &quot;Looking at the two of them, McMillan is age-appropriate for the appointment (to eventually succeed Bryan). He'll also be involved in all aspects of Sara Lee's businesses,&quot; Baras said.</p>
<p>William Leach, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, also believes McMillan is likely to succeed Bryan.  </p>
<p>&quot;McMillan is a good executive. John Bryan is 60 years old, and he's not going to live forever,&quot; Leach said.</p>
<p>John McMillin, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said he was not surprised at all by McMillan's appointment.</p>
<p>&quot;The question for me was not whether Steve McMillan would be named president, but when he would be named president,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;He's done a wonderful job developing Sara Lee's food business, and he's had experience working with some of the products,&quot; McMillin said.</p>
<p>Sara Lee shares were off 1/8 at 42-3/4 in late trading on Thursday.</p>
