<p>The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) continued to offer no power during peak demand hours on Tuesday, the agency said Monday.</p>
<p>BPA had pulled out of the on-peak market on Wednesday, citing power line restrictions, outage of a hydroelectric turbine at the Grand Coulee dam, and curtailments at the WNP-2 nuclear plant.</p>
<p>BPA continued to offer firm and non-firm power during off-peak hours on Tuesday at prices unchanged from Monday's preschedulings.</p>
<p>Tuesday non-firm power during off-peak blocks was offered at $12.50 per megawatt hour (MWh) for both Northwest and California-Oregon border (COB) deliveries, while weekend prices were $11.50.</p>
<p>Non-firm prices for hours ending 0100-0500 and 2400 were unchanged at $12.50 for all deliveries, while power during hours ending 0600 and 2300 was offered at $13.50.</p>
<p>BPA also continued to offer displacement power for hours ending 0100-0600 and 2400 PST at $9.00 per MWh and at $7.00 for Northwest buyers only.</p>
