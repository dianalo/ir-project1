<p>Traders pushed NYMEX oil prices lower Friday in what some called a &quot;breather&quot; to recent sharp gains, and just like on the way up, crude oil and gasoline followed heat back down, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market took a little breather today, said Thomas Blakeslee, analyst at Cargill Investor Services in New York.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is going to look very closely at heating oil, and will be very sensitive to weather,&quot; he said referring to the cold snap in the Northeast that fueled the latest move.</p>
<p>Heating oil for November delivery ended Friday 0.26 cent lower at 74.43 cents a gallon.  </p>
<p>The trading session was characterized by profit taking tempered by views the bull run was not over.</p>
<p>&quot;Heating oil is just like a runaway train. It's holding everything up,&quot; one trader in the heating oil ring said Friday afternoon ahead of the close.</p>
<p>Crude oil for November delivery meanwhile shed eight cents, settling at $24.73 a barrel, with no news in the market to give crude much influence in the trading rings, traders said.</p>
<p>Gasoline, with little or no influence on the market's tone, lagged the downward move, as November unleaded lost just 0.05 cent and settled at 63.63 cents a gallon.  </p>
<p>The duration of the cold snap was the subject of some disagreement among forecasters, with some saying the cold would barely last through the weekend, but others, like the National Weather Service, saying &quot;below normal&quot; temperatures would last through next week all along the East Coast.</p>
<p>Technically, November heating oil's resistance was pegged at 75.25 cents a gallon, Friday's intraday high and the latest of many post-Gulf War highs set this week, traders said.</p>
<p>November crude, plagued by views it wasn't up to the task of matching heat's gains point-for-point, was seen encountering resistance at Friday's intraday high of $24.95 -- below the $25.08 contract high made Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Beyond those levels, traders pointed to resistance for the November contract on the crude spot continuation chart at the 1996 summer and springtime highs of $25.35 and $25.70 a barrel respectively.</p>
<p>Resistance on November gasoline was meanwhile pegged at 64.00 cents a gallon, traders said.</p>
