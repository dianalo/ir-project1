<p>South African golds ended softer on Tuesday after the bullion price failed to escape its weak levels, while industrial shares finished firm after a slow start, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said sentiment in industrials was initially hit by the gold price but started to recover around noon.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a softer start weighed down by golds. It has started to pick up in industrials with Barlows and some tech stock making the running,&quot; James Scott, equity marketing manager at Societe General Frankel Pollack, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Some offshore buying was seen during the day and volumes were moderate with a few big deals in some shares.</p>
<p>Gencor traded over seven million shares, boosted by a bookover of five million shares, taking up about 17 percent of total market volume of 819 million rand.</p>
<p>Profurn saw around five million shares change hands in a foreign purchase worth over 11 million rand. Profurn ended up four cents to 200 cents as South African furniture sector continues strong in anticipation of an interest rate cut.</p>
<p>PPC also saw large volumes with over 17 million rand worth of shares changing hands. It was last up 250 cents to 71.50 rand.</p>
<p>The industrial index gained 43.2 points to 8,885.7 points, the gold index lost 23.3 points to 976.3 points and the all-share index dropped 10.1 points to 7,390.7 points.  </p>
<p>In the broader market, advancers led decliners by 195 to 179 with 29 issues reaching new highs compared to 10 which hit new lows.</p>
<p>The market was seen continuing in the same vein on Wednesday in a moderately optimistic mood and as players kept hoping for a long awaited interest rate cut. Economists polled last month by Reuters said a one-point cut may be possible by the end of the third quarter and a certainty by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Gold shares were seen nervous on the rollercoaster bullion price.</p>
<p>Hicor fell to a new year low of 54 cents after posting lower earnings per share for the 15 months ended March 31. It ended down a cent to 60 cents.</p>
<p>Tempora gained 40 cents to a new year high of 28.20 rand after the company posted a slight improvement in earnings for the year ended June 30, dealers said.</p>
<p>Near-term futures recovered most of their morning losses with the gold share contracts steady as the bullion price was about a dollar firmer from the start and the industrial futures firmer on a recovery in local bonds.</p>
<p>Dealers said there were no real sellers in the market and trade was seen positive on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The September all-share contract was last at 6,712/17 from 6,716, the industrial contract was at 8,580/88 from 8,568 and the gold contract was at 687/693 from 700.</p>
