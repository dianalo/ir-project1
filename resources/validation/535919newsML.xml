<p>By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent</p>
<p>International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus declared himself exuberant Thursday about the outlook for the world economy and voiced satisfaction with the current constellation of currency rates.</p>
<p>&quot;There are good reasons for us to be in a state of rational exuberance,&quot; the IMF chief told reporters ahead of the start of the semiannual meeting of the IMF and World Bank here.</p>
<p>The comment was a playful reference to remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who shook global stock markets in December when he warned of investors' &quot;irrational exuberance.&quot;</p>
<p>The IMF said Wednesday it expects the world economy to rack up its highest growth in nearly a decade this year, expanding by 4.4 percent after rising by 4 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Camdessus said the dollar's steep rise of the past two years -- it has appreciated by more than 50 percent against the Japanese yen alone -- has been good for the world economy.</p>
<p>The strong dollar has helped to dampen inflationary pressures in the United States by holding down import prices. Meanwhile, the economies of Japan and most countries in Europe have benefited from the weakness of their currencies, which has bolstered growth by making their exports more competitive.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not exceedingly nervous about foreign exchange markets at the moment,&quot; Camdessus told Reuters Financial Television in an interview.</p>
<p>The same cannot be said for speculators and investors in the world currency markets, who remain fearful that major nations will take action to push down the value of the dollar against the yen by selling greenbacks.</p>
<p>The dollar's strength, particularly against the yen, is among the topics expected to be discussed by finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the Group of Seven industrial nations at a gathering Sunday on the fringes of the IMF/World Bank meeting. The G7 comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.</p>
<p>Camdessus, who will attend part of the G7 meeting to brief the policy-makers on the world economic outlook, seemed to play down the chances of dollar-selling intervention by the group.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see intervention by monetary authorities to be the first order of priority,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Instead, major nations need to focus on the pursuit of appropriate economic policies, he said. Currency rates would then change in response.</p>
<p>For Japan, that means keeping interest rates low and being prepared to loosen its budget stance if its economy falters, he said.</p>
<p>That is much the same point that has been made by U.S. officials, who have voiced concern that Japan's 1997 budget squeeze will sap demand at home for its products and prompt its firms to look abroad for growth, boosting the trade surplus.</p>
<p>Camdessus welcomed last month's increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve and made clear that a further rise would be justified to prevent the economy from overheating.</p>
<p>&quot;It's clear that they (investors) expect some further tightening to take place sometime down the road during the year, and I would be surprised if in this occurence the markets were wrong,&quot; the IMF chief said.</p>
<p>The U.S. central bank last month raised short-term interest rates for the first time in more than two years, nudging them up by a quarter percentage point. Wall Street stock prices swooned in response, although they have since recouped much of those losses.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, Camdessus seconded comments made by his chief economist Wednesday that U.S. stock prices looked to be on the &quot;rich side&quot; now. But he did not express any particular concern about that.</p>
<p>As he has done before, Camdessus urged European Union member nations to press ahead with plans to launch a single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>He welcomed France's decision to hold an early two-round parliamentary election in May and June as potentially strengthening momentum to European monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;Elections are an essential element of democratic life. They are always a good thing. I do not see a negative factor in this domain,&quot; the IMF chief said.</p>
