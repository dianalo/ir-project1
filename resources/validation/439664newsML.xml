<p>The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday proposed to allocate additional airwaves for geostationary and non-geostationary fixed-satellite services, a move the agency said would help foster competition.</p>
<p>The agency also sought comment on whether other operations could be accommodated in the proposed satellite bands.</p>
<p>The satellite proposals would offer a variety of services, including cellular backhaul and &quot;personal communications services&quot; backhaul, as well as backup and disaster recovery.</p>
<p>The FCC said it wanted to give companies that propose such services the chance to make them available to the public.  </p>
<p>The FCC proposed to add a fixed satellite allocation to the 37.5 to 38.5 and 40.5 to 41.5 gigahertz bands. These bands would be used for geostationary and non-geostationary downlinks.</p>
<p>The agency also proposed to designate the 48.2 to 50.2 gigahertz band for corresponding satellite uplinks.</p>
<p>To protect terrestrial operations, the FCC proposed to upgrade, from secondary to primary, the fixed and mobile service allocations throughout the 40.5 to 42.5 gigahertz band.</p>
<p>Finally, the agency proposed to add a fixed allocation to the 46.9 to 47.0 gigahertz band.</p>
<p>The FCC also provided an overview of its band segmentation plan for the 36 to 51.4 gigahertz frequency band. The agency said the plan would allow both satellite and wireless communications services &quot;the best opportunity to succeed.&quot;</p>
