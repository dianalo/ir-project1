<p>U.S. liquefied petroleum gas prices were largely stable in quiet trade late on Wednesday with much of the market already wrapped up for March, players said.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people have already closed up their positions,&quot; said one Houston-based trader. &quot;It's going to be quiet here until next week.&quot;</p>
<p>The upcoming Easter holiday will also dampen trade since many players said they plan to take Thursday as well as Friday and possibly Monday off.</p>
<p>In the U.S. Gulf Coast, Mont Belvieu, Texas, spot propane remained between 37.50 cents and 38.00 cents a gallon, with deals done in the range.</p>
<p>Conway, Kansas, in the Midwest, also stayed unchanged.</p>
<p>The butane market was also reported quiet but still hanging on to weaker values following reports that Enterprise signed a contract with Algerian state oil company Sonatrach for two cargoes of butane each month from May through October.</p>
<p>Enterprise would neither confim nor deny the report. But, traders said the company was in the market Wednesday selling propane, perhaps as a possible hedge against against the cargoes.</p>
<p>The butane markets were stable in quiet activity. ((--Laney Salisbury, New York Energy Desk 1212 859-1631))</p>
