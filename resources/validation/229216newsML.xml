<headline>UK fund sellers see rule changes after DMG affair.</headline>

<p>Two thirds of independent financial advisers (IFAs) expect new regulatory changes in the UK after the Morgan Grenfell funds affair but only three percent say it will damage the sector long term, an industry survey shows.</p>
<p>The 24th Unit Trust survey, conducted by Gavin Anderson &amp; Co among 200 IFAs in September and October said 34 percent of IFAs expected &quot;closer monitoring of funds&quot;, 22 percent saw &quot;tighter control by regulators&quot; and 14 percent predicted &quot;a stronger role for trustees&quot;.</p>
<p>The views of IFAs, the financial intermediaries between large investment houses producing financial products and the retail public who buy them, are critical to the industry.</p>
<p>Some 74 percent saw only relatively minor and short term damage to the industry in the wake of the scandal, which forced Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's parent Deutsche Bank to stump up 200 million stg to bail out three funds, and led to the sacking of two top fund managers.</p>
<p>A significant 24 percent of those polled said there would be &quot;no serious consequences at all&quot; from the affair.</p>
<p>But the proportion of IFAs who are optimistic about the prospects for unit trusts generally has fallen to 64 percent from 82 percent in a similar survey six months ago.</p>
<p>Forty-two percent of IFAs say their own unit trust and PEP (personal equity plan) business has remained static, up from 13 percent six months ago.</p>
<p>Only 13 percent say their business has increased, down from 50 percent six months ago.</p>
<p>Commenting on the finding, analyst James Wood at Gavin Anderson said the reaction was interesting. &quot;I look forward to comparing their reaction with that of unit trust investors in our survey which comes out in January 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Among IFAs who believe there will be no serious consequences, the most popular reason was that &quot;people have short memories&quot;, followed by the belief that &quot;Deutsche Bank rescued the situation&quot;.</p>
<p>Wood also noted that markets are at an all-time high. &quot;Although this does not technically represent an over-valuation, this may account for the significant decrease in IFA optimism over prospects for unit trusts for the rest of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the decreased optimism from IFAs, figures released by the industry body AUTIF, the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, for October show that unit trust sales actually increased by 50 percent to 310 million stg.</p>
