<p>The union spearheading a Spanish truckers strike may start its first talks with the government on Saturday to end the action which has crippled commerce and cross-border traffic.</p>
<p>Representatives of the union Fedatrans were in contacts with officials on Saturday morning to discuss the possibility of negotiations that could begin later in the day, a union spokswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;At this moment, they are in contact with the government but not negotiating yet,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Fedetrans has so far boycotted negotiations between an interministerial committee and transport associations, demanding the government meet with it separately. The government agreed to the separate talks late Friday night.</p>
<p>The 10-day-old strike to demand better labour conditions and lower fuel prices has caused major disruptions and been peppered with violence. One striker was killed on Thursday when he ran out in front of a passing French truck to try to stop it.</p>
<p>French truckers said on Friday Spanish pickets had attacked them.</p>
<p>European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock condemned the outbreaks of violence and urged Madrid on Friday to protect drivers from harm.</p>
<p>Like a French truckers strike last year which disrupted much of Western Europe with a 12-day blockade, Spanish drivers are demanding an overhaul of their sector.</p>
<p>They want retirement age lowered to 60 from 65, recognition of professional illnesses and curbs on surging fuel prices among other demands.</p>
<p>The cabinet introduced deregulatory measures on Friday aimed at lowering fuel costs in a bid to appease strikers. Fedetrans welcomed the step cautiously but did not call off the strike, saying it was not enough.</p>
<p>The government warned on Friday the strike was causing grave damage to the Spanish economy and promised neighbours France and Portugal, the two countries most affected by the strike, it would ensure unimpeded movement on the roads.</p>
<p>The strike has choked roads in northern Spain, blocked ports and forced domestic and foreign carmakers to cut back or halt production at some factories.</p>
<p>Under government orders, security forces have been escorting trucks to ensure supplies of essential goods to areas where supplies had been cut off.</p>
<p>Thousands of striking trucks are lined up on the hard shoulders of main roads and pickets were intimidating any drivers who dared to pass.</p>
<p>They have also blockaded border crossing with France and Portugal, trapping hundreds of foreign drivers at the frontiers.</p>
<p>If no solution is reached at the weekend, the strike looked set to escalate with taxi unions calling on members to join the truckers on Monday.</p>
<p>The Economy Ministry has warned a continuation of the strike would cause a steep increase in fish and produce prices.</p>
<p>The agriculture sector alone has lost some 30 billion pesetas so far, Spanish newspapers said on Saturday. Dairy, meat, fish and produce were worst hit.</p>
