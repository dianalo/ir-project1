<p>Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar on Tuesday expressed disappointment over the course of the country's bond privatisation scheme introduced last August, blaming Privatisation Minister Peter Bisak for the poor start.</p>
<p>Speaking at a news conference after the regular weekly government session, spokeswoman Magda Pospisilova conveyed Meciar's disappointment with the plan to date, calling the current levels at which the bonds are trading a crime.</p>
<p>&quot;The Premier said trade with the bonds at 3,500, or even 2,500 crowns, can only be called daylight robbery,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The government had guaranteed a minimum price for trading at 7,500 crowns, but Pospisilova noted they are now changing hands in large volumes at prices significantly below the minimum.</p>
<p>Trading of the bonds kicked off to much fanfare but little else in August as thousands of citizens lined up to sell the paper, issued by state privatisation agency NPF. The paper is also redeemable for shares in firms to be privatised.</p>
<p>As of September 30, only 1,590 bonds were traded in anonymous over-the-counter auctions and 70,515 bonds were sold directly, mostly at a price equal or close to 7,500 crowns.</p>
<p>The bonds, which can only be redeemed in five years, hold a nominal value of 10,000 crowns and were issued to some 3.3 million Slovaks in place of the cancelled voucher privatisation.</p>
<p>The bonds have a floating coupon equal to the discount rate, currently 8.8 percent.</p>
<p>But difficulty selling the bonds and lack of trust in the scheme has pushed people to sell the bonds at almost any price.</p>
<p>&quot;The Premier strongly urged minister Bisak to devote increased attention to this problem, to consult with the NPF and propose further action to the government,&quot; Pospisilova said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the consultations...do not result in immediate improvement, the government will draw political conclusions,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Bisak is a member of the junior governing coalition partner, the leftist Slovak Workers Party (ZRS).</p>
