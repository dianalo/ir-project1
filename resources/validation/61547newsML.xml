<p>Abraxas Petroleum Corp said on Wednesday it has agreed to repurchase its interests in two Texas oil and gas fields from an undisclosed investment partnership for $27.5 million after selling a portion of them for $15.6 million earlier this year.</p>
<p>&quot;At the time of the sale, Abrazas believed that Portilla and Happy were mature properties and chose to monetize its investment in these fields in order to provide capital for other higher return projects,&quot; Robert Watson, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Of the $27.5 million, Abraxas said the purchase price includes repayment of $20.6 million of the partnership's indebtedness.</p>
<p>Abraxas acquired 100 percent working interest in the Portilla Field in San Patricio County and a 12 percent working interest in Happy Field in Garza County, plus a 100 percent stake in a natural gas processing plant at Portilla.</p>
<p>Abraxas sold in March 1996 a 50 percent working interest in the Portilla Field in San Patricio County and a 12 percent working interest in the Happy Field in Garza County for $15.6 million, it said.</p>
<p>Portilla and Happy fields have aggregate reserves of 4.3 million barrels of oil equivalents with 65.7 percent of that in crude oil, Abraxas said.</p>
<p>The gas processing plant has a capacity of 20 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and processed an average of 18.2 million cubic feet of gas a day for the first six months of 1996, the company said.</p>
<p>Abraxas said it was able to find 18 additional possible exploration projects with significant reserve potential after a horizontal well was drilled at Portilla.</p>
