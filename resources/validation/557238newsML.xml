<p>Veteran British war correspondent Martin Bell swept to a stunning victory in the Conservatives' fifth safest seat on Friday in a further humiliation of the ruling party.</p>
<p>Standing reluctantly as an independent anti-sleaze candidate and wearing his trademark &quot;lucky&quot; white suit, the former BBC journalist beat ex-minister Neil Hamilton, who failed to shake off allegations of parliamentary corruption.</p>
<p>Bell was supported by the Labour Party and Liberal Democrats and won the prosperous Tatton constituency in northwestern England by an astonishing 11,077 votes.</p>
<p>Throughout the campaign, Hamilton denied allegations that he took money from Mohammed al Fayed, owner of the Harrods luxury department store, to ask questions in parliament.</p>
<p>Bell said standing for election was more frightening than dodging bullets in Sarajevo's &quot;Sniper Alley&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a proud moment for Tatton and humbling one for me. I believe you have lit a beacon which will shed light in some dark corners and illuminate the mother of parliaments itself,&quot; said an emotional Bell after his victory was announced.</p>
<p>&quot;It is strong signal to the rest of the country which will be heeded. What you have accomplished here is some kind of political miracle. I shall remain independent, serve for one term only&quot;</p>
<p>He then quoted from the English author G.K. Chesterton: &quot;Smile at us, pay us, pass us but do not quite forget. That we are the people of England and we have not spoken yet.&quot;</p>
<p>A drained Hamilton, jeered by sections of the crowd after the result was announced, said he was &quot;devastated&quot;. But he said he was confident he would be vindicated.</p>
<p>Bell's election fight was a gesture against what newspapers called &quot;sleaze&quot; -- allegations that members of parliament had taken cash in return for asking questions.</p>
<p>Bell's campaign sparked a media frenzy which also engulfed his glamorous daughter Melissa, who took leave of absence from her job in the marketing department of the Reuters office in Brussels to act as her father's campaign manager.</p>
<p>She and her chic young friends were contrasted to Hamilton's wife and chief defender Christine, whose aggressive tone towards the media pursuing her husband led her to be dubbed &quot;the Tory (Conservative) wife from hell&quot;.</p>
