<p>BOFORS CASE DOCUMENTS BROUGHT TO COUNTRY</p>
<p>The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) brought back the much-awaited Swiss bank documents related to controversial Bofors gun deal from Berne. The documents, detailing the transactions of five Swiss bank accounts into which an estimated 650 million rupees in kickbacks were allegedly deposited, were brought in a sealed box by a CBI team led by its director. The CBI director said the scrutiny of the documents would start immediately and the agency would definitely give a final shape to the case by April-May this year.</p>

<p>APEX COURT DIRECTS HIGH COURT TO SHOW RESTRAINT</p>
<p>The Supreme Court asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to refrain from reporting the progress of investigations in the Animal Husbandry scam in Bihar to higher authorities. It laid down broad guidelines for the CBI as well as the Patna High Court monitoring the investigations. The apex court cautioned the High Court against making any observation on the merits of accusations made in the case. The court observed the nature of proceedings before the High Court was somewhat similar to those pending in the apex court in the hawala (illegal money transaction) and godman Chandraswami cases.</p>

<p>RELIANCE SCRIP RISES 3.5 PCT ON BOMBAY BOURSE</p>
<p>Reliance Industries' stock continued to hold centrestage for the third consecutive day on the back of renewed domestic speculative interest and purchases from US-based funds. The Reliance share price rose by 8.75 rupees, or 3.53 percent, in hectic trade to 256.50 rupees on the Bombay bourse even as most other pivotals ruled easy. Reliance clocked a volume of 8.42 million shares valued at 2.15 billion rupees. On the National bourse, the Reliance counter topped the list with volumes of 4.77 billion, accounting for 32.32 percent of the total traded volume of 14.67 billion rupees.</p>

<p>DIESEL, LPG PRICES TO BE HIKED TO BRIDGE DEFICIT</p>
<p>The government proposes to bridge the oil pool account deficit through a combination of three measures. These are by marginally increasing price of diesel and liquified petroleum gas (LPG), by deregulating the price of diesel and LPG in the current year, and by partially paying up the accumulated diesel and kerosene subsidy to the Indian Oil Corporation. It is said there is all-round agreement on this among the United Front constituents, including the Left parties. The government is planning to bridge the oil pool deficit roughly by 50 percent in fiscal 1996/97 (April-March) and to wipe out the entire deficit over a period of two to three years.</p>

<p>GE CAPILAL BUYS 47 PCT SRF FINANCE STAKE</p>
<p>Delhi-based SRF Finance was sold off to GE Capital, the world's largest finance company. Under the agreement, GE Capital acquired the entire 47 percent stake held by the SRF group at a price of 54 rupees a share, aggregating 500 million rupees. This was the largest ever acquisition of an Indian finance company by a multinational. The acquisition would make GE Capital a financial powerhouse, giving it a vehicle to ride into leasing and hire purchase activities. GE Capital would also get the benefit of SRF Finance's distribution network.</p>

<p>CABINET CLEARS CIVIL AVIATION POLICY</p>
<p>The cabinet cleared the domestic civil aviation policy. It laid down that foreign investment up to 40 percent would be allowed in domestic airlines. However, the issue of allowing foreign airlines to pick up stake in domestic airlines was referred back to the Civil Aviation Ministry for further consideration. Sources said the fate of the $600 million Tata-SIA proposal for domestic airlines would become clear only after receiving the ministry's opinion on the issue of foreign airlines acquiring stake in domestic airlines. However, no time frame was set for the ministry to clarify its mind on this issue, sources added.</p>

<p>GUJARAT STATE FINANCIAL CORP GOING PUBLIC</p>
<p>The Gujarat State Financial Corporation (GSFC) is going public with a 470 million rupee issue at a premium of 10 rupees. Lead managed by ICICI Securities and Lloyds Finance, the issue of 23.5 million rupee equity shares at 20 rupees each is slated to open on February 1, 1997.

<p>DETAILS SOUGHT ON TOP TEN VOLATILE SCRIPS</p>
<p>The recent bullish fervour witnessed on the Bombay bourse (BSE) has alerted the taxation department and the stock market regulator (SEBI). Both SEBI and income tax authorities have sought broker-wise details from the BSE of the top 10 volatile scrips on January 16 and 17. Information sought include names of both buyers and sellers involved not just in official deals, but even off-market deals which are normally pushed through in the official system the following day. The BSE index had shot up to 3,673.91 points after an intra-day low of 3.487.27 on January 15, 1997. Speculator hammering in the next two days saw the index touch an intra-day low of 3,342.89 on January 17, a 146.03 points</p>

<p>MONOPOLY VOICE CARRIER'S GDR ISSUE PROSPECT IMPROVES</p>
<p>The price-sharing pact between the Department of Telecommunications and Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) improved the prospect of VSNL's much-awaited $600 million global offering. The price-sharing formula insulated VSNL, a thinly traded stock, from business vagaries over the next four to five years. Analysts said VSNL, the monopoly voice carrier, could now hope to get a 15-20 percent premium over the domestic price. Kotak Securities said the new revenue sharing agreement would quell fears of the impact of low accounting rates on VSNL.</p>

<p>FIAT-PREMIER TIEUP APPROVED</p>
<p>The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) recommended clearance of Fiat Auto's 20 billion rupee proposal for a 74 percent stake in a joint venture with the promoters of Premier Automobile Ltd (PAL), the Doshi family, to the Industry Ministry for approval. The joint venture would manufacture the Palio, the Siena and the Station Wagon car models from the Fiat stable, slated for a late-1999 launch in the domestic market.</p>

<p>FISCAL DEFICIT EXPECTED TO TOUCH 5.2 PCT OF GDP</p>
<p>The fiscal deficit for the current fiscal year may average 5.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) against a target of five percent, a Finance Ministry paper said. This was on account of the government being forced to accommodate in addition to the 21.7 billion rupee supplementary grant, 12 billion rupees for defence, 6.5 billion as special plan assistance for Kashmir, 1.5 billion on the space programme and 1.7 billion as additional budgetary support for railways. Budget deficit, as on December 27, 1996 was 68.39 billion rupees compared to 102.01 billion for the corresponding period in 1995/96 (April-March), the note said.</p>

<p>PARTIES TURN POPULIST, SHRINK FROM HARD DECISIONS</p>
<p>With the spectre of mid-term polls looming large, all major political parties indicated populism taking precedence over economic decisions. Events signalled the government would be forced to defer crucial economic decisions like fixing the growing oil pool deficit and liberalising norms governing foreign direct investment. For the first time, a political body discussed and decided issues that were to go before the cabinet. Decisions on Suzuki's stake in Maruti Udyog and Tata-Singapore Airlines tie-up were taken by the ruling party's core group of senior leaders. In tandem with the ruling party's stand, the Congress party expressed reservations about the two proposals, adding they were ag</p>

<p>PHONE SERVICE OPERATORS' TIFF WITH MINISTRY</p>
<p>Private telephone service operators and the Finance Ministry do not agree on external commercial borrowing (ECB) norms and method of project cost accounting. The cash-strapped telecommunication services sector has become more vociferous in its demand for changes after the ministry denied permission to ABN Amro to lend to JT Mobile. The ministry denied permission because the sanctioned loan amount exceeded 35 percent of the project cost in violation of ECB guidelines. However, the bone of contention was the ministry's method of estimating project cost. The problem for private operators was compounded with the finance ministry deciding to bar foreign banks from providing loans and foreign</p>

<p>TUSSLE BETWEEN BROADCASTING, TELECOMMUNICATION MINISTRIES A tussle between the broadcasting (I&amp;B) and telecommunication ministries delayed the introduction of the draft broadcasting bill in parliament. The draft bill stipulations limits cable operators to broadcast channels licensed by the government. Licences to satellite channels would involve a considerable sum as licensing fee. The telecom ministry wants a share in the licensing process and the resulting revenue on the grounds that cable operators were currently registered with it under the Cable Network Regulation Act. The I&amp;B ministry, opposing the telecom ministry, said controlling and monitoring of airwaves being their conce</p>

<p>SIAM ALLOWED TO ACQUIRE STAKE IN CATHOLIC SYRIAN</p>
<p>The Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment (CCFI) permitted the Siam Vidya Group of Thailand to acquire an equity stake of up to 40 percent in the Catholic Syrian Bank Ltd. The CCFI also approved Gujarat Alumina and Bauxite Ltd to set up a plant for the manufacture of alumina and its compounds, metallurgical coke, power and desalinated water in Kutch district of Gujarat. In another approval, Central India Power Company Ltd, which had been permitted to set up a 1,000 MW coal-based thermal power project at Chandrapur in Maharashtra, was allowed changes in plant capacity, capital cost, foreign equity amount and foreign debt.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>DECISION ON CUTTING AVIATION FUEL PRICE DEFERRED</p>
<p>The cabinet deferred a decision on lowering aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices for domestic operations. While approving the domestic aviation policy, it decided to skip the discussion on the issue of offering ATF at international prices to domestic airlines saying it was part of the larger fuel pricing issue. Since aviation fuel accounts for 30-35 percent of total operational costs, domestic airlines have been demanding ATF at price levels at which international carriers buy it in the country. Domestic operators pay nearly 40 percent more than international carriers for ATF.</p>

<p>GOVERNMENT BACKTRACKS ON FOODGRAIN PRICE HIKE</p>
<p>The ruling coalition backtracked from its earlier decision to hike the price of foodgrain for the public distribution system (PDS) from February 1, 1997. Coming under pressure from the Left parties, the cabinet chose to defer the issue of price hike to a later date. This was the first time in its eight-month tenure that the government revoked a decision intended to prune the additional food subsidy burden the exchequer would incur by supplying foodgrain at subsidised rates to those below the poverty line. The Civil Supplies Ministry, which had recommended the hike alongwith its proposal to restructure the PDS, piloted a fresh proposal to postpone the increase in issue prices, sources sai</p>
