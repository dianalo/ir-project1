<title>USA: Bulgaria debt dives on rising default fears.</title>
<headline>Bulgaria debt dives on rising default fears.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bulgarian debt took center stage when President Petar Stoyanov shocked the market with remarks in Brussels that the country may have to default on its debt repayments if no international aid is forthcoming.</p>
<p>Bulgarian Brady bonds, which had already weakened on technical delays in its coupon payment due January 28, tumbled. Bulgaria FLRB lost 1-3/8 to 34-1/8 and IAB plunged 2-1/8 to 46-3/8.</p>
<p>&quot;With what the president said, people came to sense that the resolution to the political stalemate would be protracted,&quot; said an analyst.  </p>
<p>Unless a new government was formed to implement the currency board, the international multilateral agencies would not extend help, he said.</p>
<p>Traders said a major European bank stopped making market in Bulgarian debt, sending further panic through the market. Sources from the bank's New York office  declined to comment.</p>
<p>Latin debts were mostly weaker, taking a respite from the rally of the past two says, traders said.</p>
<p>In Brazil, the passage of the presidential re-election amandment vote in the lower house late Tuesday came as expected but the debt prices eased.  </p>
<p>&quot;It was built into the prices so people saw the opportunity to take some profits,&quot; said a trader. &quot;I think it bodes well for future votes.&quot;</p>
<p>Ingrid Iverson, debt strategist at UBS Securities, said Tuesday's vote was a vote of confidence in President Henrique Cardoso.</p>
<p>&quot;Cardoso's major achievement has been to eliminate hyperinflation,&quot; she said. &quot;It looks like he could win and that is good for reform.&quot;  </p>
<p>Iverson expected &quot;a little bit of noise over the next few weeks&quot; as political parties look at all the amendments and prepare for the second vote, but she did not see major obstacles.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the next one to three months, Brrazil will be one of the better performers,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Brazil C eased 1/8 to 76-1/8.</p>
<p>On the heel of its $2 billion 20-year global bond last week, Argentina issued 500 million peso-denominated Eurobond.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand is good,&quot; said a syndicate manager. &quot;It was two times over-subscribed.&quot;  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Moody's Investors Service assigned a B1 rating on Argentina's local currency debt, the same as its foreign currency debt.</p>
<p>Argentina FRBs was 1/4 lower at 89.00 bid.</p>
<p>Mexico is about to price a 10-year lira-denominated eurobond. Market sources said it would be 500 billion lire, or about $370 million. Mexico raised $1 billion in a 10-year global bond on January 9.</p>
<p>Latin issuers rushed to the market for fear global interest rates might trend higher later in the year, said Carlos Asilis, chief Latin America economist at Oppenheimer, Inc.</p>
<p>But more importantly, he said, the early infusion of capital into the economy could boost consumer confidence and speed the recovery.</p>
