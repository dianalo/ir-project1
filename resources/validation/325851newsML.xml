<p>Competition among British electricity generators is increasing but is still inadequate, Stephen Littlechild, director general of electricity supply, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not satisfied with the present extent of competitiveness either in the (wholesale electricity) pool or in generation,&quot; Littlechild told parliament's Trade and Industry Select Committee.  </p>
<p>Littlechild said he welcomed a steady decline in the combined share of the electricity generation market held by National Power Plc and PowerGen Plc. This had declined from 80 percent when they were privatised to 57 percent in 1995 and about 45 percent now.</p>
<p>&quot;More needs to be done but it's moving in the right direction,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Littlechild predicted that the generators' market share would come under increasing pressure in the next year or two as new capacity came on stream.  </p>
<p>In addition to 6,000 megawatts of generating capacity already installed by new entrants to the market, 1,250 kw of plant was being tested and should be on stream within a month and a further 2,000 mw was under construction and should be in operation by 1998 at the latest, Littlechild said.</p>
<p>A further 1,000 mw of capacity would be available once a new Scottish power interconnector was linked up, he added.</p>
<p>Generating prices fell five percent in real terms last year, and Littlechild said he expected further declines. Market expectations, he noted, were for a 5-10 percent fall in the next two or three years.  </p>
<p>As generating capacity increased, the ability of National Power and PowerGen to set wholesale pool prices would decline further over the next year or so, Littlechild predicted.</p>
<p>Martin O'Neill, the chairman of the cross-party panel of MPs, said the two firms still held the whip hand and set pool prices about 65 percent of the time. The figure in late November for the latest six-month period was 78 percent, O'Neill added.</p>
<p>&quot;You're going to get increasing competition in that area, as I think prices will fall and that will be a more competitive part of the market,&quot; Littlechild said.  </p>
<p>Littlechild said he had no market share &quot;target&quot; in mind for National Power and PowerGen, which he said currently had about 22 percent each of the market.</p>
<p>The two firms were able to exercise market power now, but the regulator said he did not know at what threshold of market share this power would ebb.</p>
<p>He rejected as &quot;unconvincing&quot; the argument that the two generators needed a substantial share of the British market as a springboard for international expansion. &quot;You don't need a large, cushy home base to compete abroad,&quot; Littlechild added.</p>
<p>He said he could envisage the threshold for supply price controls (already scrapped for customers buying more than 100 kilowatts of electricity) being lowered further.</p>
<p>Controls for Britain's 20 million household customers would have to stay, at least for now, but Littlechild said the position should be reviewed after 1998 when that segment of the market is opened up to competition.</p>
