<title>YUGOSLAVIA: Serbian students turn out for renewed protest.</title>
<headline>Serbian students turn out for renewed protest.</headline>
<dateline>BELGRADE 1996-12-10</dateline>

<p>Tens of thousands of students took to the streets of Belgrade on Tuesday in what has become a daily ritual of mass protests against the socialist rule of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, eyewitnesses said.</p>
<p>The 23rd day of mass demonstrations against the reversal of the results of a November 17 municipal election which the opposition said it won, coincided with the Yugoslav federal parliament's first session since the disputed poll.</p>
<p>Opposition parties, which were due to stage their own daily protest march later on Tuesday, boycotted the session and vowed to stay away until Milosevic admitted he cheated them of their election victory in the capital and 14 other Serbian towns.</p>
<p>The legality of the election results is currently under examination by the federal supreme court after the Serbian supreme court rejected opposition appeals over the weekend. The decision of the federal court was expected later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Students said they had deposited a copy of Serbia's constitution at the republic's supreme court. &quot;Today is World Human Rights Day and that is why we are reminding Serbia's supreme court of the law which they should respect,&quot; a student leader told Reuters.</p>
<p>Reports of the alleged beating of an opposition supporter who was arrested last Friday for carrying the effigy of Milosevic in prison garb have fuelled the student's anger.</p>
<p>The pro-democracy rallies have posed the most sustained challenge to Milosevic's nine-year rule during which he has kept a tight grip on state institutions.</p>
<p>Belgrade has come under a barrage of western criticism for its handling of the elections. On Tuesday NATO &quot;strongly deplored&quot; the cancellation of election results and called on Milosevic to reverse the decision.</p>
