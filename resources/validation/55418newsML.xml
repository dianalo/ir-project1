<p>Police in southern Russia were searching on Tuesday for a lone hijacker who held dozens of people hostage on a bus in the ethnic region of Dagestan, which neighbours Chechnya, before releasing them unharmed and fleeing.</p>
<p>The man seized the bus in the Dagestan capital Makhachkala at around 6.30 p.m. (1430 GMT), news agencies said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the interior ministry in Moscow initially said there were 35 people aboard but chief ministry spokesman Alexander Furs was quoted by ORT state television as saying there were 48 hostages.</p>
<p>After about an hour, the hijacker fled with three of the hostages and a local politician, who had offered himself as a substitute, in the politician's car.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted interior ministry officials in Dagestan as saying the hijacker released the remaining hostage near the town of Khasavyurt, 100 km (60 miles) from Makhachkala, and walked across the border into Chechnya.</p>
<p>It said the man said he was a Chechen.</p>
<p>The interior ministry had at first said there were two or three hijackers and that they were seeking $100,000 ransom and had demanded a helicopter.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency, citing a source in one of Russia's &quot;power ministries&quot;, said it was unclear where the hijacker had gone. By one version, he had fled to Chechnya, by another he was hiding in Dagestan. His nationality was also unclear.</p>
<p>Initial reports stirred memories of last January's bloody raid on the Dagestan town of Kizlyar when Chechen guerrillas led by Salman Raduyev took hundreds of hostages.</p>
<p>They then withstood days of Russian air and artillery bombardment in the village of Pervomaiskoye, near Khasavyurt, before escaping back across the Chechen border.</p>
<p>However, later reports indicated the bus seizure was unrelated to the conflict in Chechnya, where a fragile ceasefire has held since the end of last month.</p>
<p>Russian security chief Alexander Lebed and Chechen rebel military commander Aslan Maskhadov signed a peace deal on August 31, halting nearly 21 months of fighting.</p>
<p>Lebed was due to fly to Chechnya on Tuesday, where he would seek to resolve problems relating to the withdrawal of Russian forces from the region, his press spokesman told Tass.</p>
<p>Monday's hijacking was the latest of several in the volatile North Caucasus region in recent years.</p>
<p>On September 20, 1995, two hijackers demanded $1.5 million and a helicopter after seizing a bus in Makhachkala. The next day police stormed the vehicle, arresting the men and freeing all 18 hostages.</p>
<p>In May 1994, four Chechens were arrested after hijacking a school bus near Vladikavkaz and flying four of the hostages by helicopter with them back to Chechnya. A month later, three gunmen were captured as they tried to flee with their ransom after holding a busload of passengers near Mineralniye Vody.</p>
<p>In December 1993, police arrested four men in Makhachkala, freeing teenagers seized at a school in the southern Russian city of Rostov and flown by helicopter across the region.</p>
