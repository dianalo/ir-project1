<title>SINGAPORE: Pressures grow for mergers of oil giants in Asia.</title>
<headline>Pressures grow for mergers of oil giants in Asia.</headline>

<p>Mega-mergers between oil giants are the flavor of 1996 in North America and Europe and pressures are growing that could lead to similar deals in Asia.</p>
<p>The benefits of merging may not seem so obvious to producers operating in Asia, as they have been elsewhere, because demand forecasts for the region are so bullish.</p>
<p>&quot;The difference between Asia-Pacific and mature markets is very much the way in which most of the major corporations view their futures,&quot; said a strategist for a major oil company.</p>
<p>&quot;They are viewing Asia-Pacific with fantastic growth potential. So there is more reluctance and less of a drive to get into bed with others.&quot;</p>
<p>But some analysts said Asian refining margins are increasingly weak, smaller but growing oil companies are taking market share and state oil companies are becoming more and more aggressive as energy deregulation sweeps the region.</p>
<p>These may be the elements, they say, that will eventually prompt mergers between major producers even in Asia -- the region which many executives view as the future for their companies.</p>
<p>Cooperation on exploration and production projects is common in the global oil community. Mergers with state oil companies as a gateway to individual markets are also a regular feature.</p>
<p>Multi-billion dollar mergers between integrated companies are less common. But this year, Mobil Corp. and British Petroleum Co. Plc  agreed to merge their refining and marketing operations in Europe into a $5 billion joint venture.</p>
<p>Texaco Inc. and Shell Oil Co. confirmed  this month that they were talking about a possible merger of their refining and marketing operations in the United States. The merger would take 15 percent of the huge U.S. market and control assets of $17 billion. It would be in partnership with Saudi Arabia, through a Texaco/Saudi joint venture, so guaranteeing crude supplies from the world's biggest crude exporter.</p>
<p>Stuart Saint, vice president of consultants Arthur D. Little Inc., said, &quot;The joint ventures in the USA and Europe are driven by weak profitability, flat demand and a desire to cut costs. In Asia, the situation is different except in Japan where there may be increasing recognition that weak margins are here to stay and improving profitability is essential.&quot;</p>
<p>Japanese oil groups have already started merging some operations, most noticeably in distribution, in a bid to cut costs in the post-deregulation era.</p>
<p>Some analysts say mergers between entire companies are not far off in Japan.</p>
<p>A government survey this month showed profits at 12 leading companies slumped 54.1 percent to 28 billion yen ($249 million) in the April-September half year.</p>
<p>Analysts say elsewhere in Asia, refinery profit margins are under pressure and could remain so heading into the next century as supply overtakes demand.</p>
<p>In the much longer term, however, demand is expected to become a stronger factor and outpace supply.</p>
<p>Since mid-year basic refinery margins for swing producer Singapore have fallen several dollars per barrel into the red at times and currently stand around 50 cents into losses.</p>
<p>Traders said margins were negative in the growing South Korea refining industry, but refiners there are concerned more with maintaining market share than producing maximum profits.</p>
<p>At the same time, exploration and production successes have not matched expectations, said Trevor MacMurray, senior director at business consultants McKinsey &amp; Co.</p>
<p>&quot;The realism of getting a good return from investments is setting in. A few years ago people were quite euphoric about prospects here,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts estimated more than $40 billion would be needed in refinery investments in the next 15 years to meet projected demand growth of 6 percent per year.</p>
<p>But many Asian grassroots refinery projects involving major producers are stalled, most noticeably in China. Domestic policy changes and haggles over allowing foreign access to China's domestic markets have delayed five projects involving  industry leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;In China, many companies have spent a lot of money and have been left frustrated,&quot; said one analyst, who requested anonymity.</p>
