<p>Royal Bank of Scotland said on Wednesday a strong performance from its British banking operations helped it achieve a 23 percent rise in first half profits.</p>
<p>The Edinburgh-based bank reported pre-tax profits of 369 million pounds ($603.3 million) for the six months to March 31, up from 301 million pounds the previous year. It will pay an increased interim dividend of 6.2 pence.</p>
<p>&quot;A key issue is the excellent performance from the UK bank,&quot; Royal Bank's chief executive George Mathewson told Reuters.</p>
<p>Mathewson said a 24 percent increase in pretax earnings, market penetration on the corporate side, good growth in retail savings and &quot;excellent credit card performance&quot; made for &quot;a very satisfactory outcome&quot;.</p>
<p>Analysts had forecast pre-tax profits of between 345 and 383 million pounds. They said that although UK banking profits were strong, overall results were no better than expected.</p>
<p>Royal Bank's shares down 3.5 pence at 582p at 1012 GMT but some dealers said this was due to profit-taking.</p>
<p>There had been some doubts about the performance of the bank's Direct Line insurance arm which showed a small profit increase to eight million pounds, from five million pounds.</p>
<p>Mathewson played down concerns about Direct Line, pointing out that predictions of &quot;Doomsday scenarios&quot; were off the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;Direct Line Insurance has retained profitability and we see signs in the market place that prices are beginning to recover and we expect our results this year we to be better than last year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He would not be drawn on just how much better this would be but said that Direct Line Financial Services' mortgage business was expected to move into profit &quot;some time over the next two years or 18 months&quot;.</p>
<p>Royal Bank's U.S. retail banking arm Citizens had performed well following its successful acquisition of First New Hampshire. Mathewson said Citizens had achieved natural growth of around eight percent in addition to this.</p>
<p>&quot;The franchise continues to improve and we think we will continue to generate a lot of profit there,&quot; Mathewson said.</p>
<p>He expects some further expansion through acquisition but this will be involve deepening the franchise rather than widening it, sticking within areas the bank already operates in.</p>
<p>Mathewson said there are no immediate plans to increase Royal Bank's holding of Spain's Banco Santander but he hinted that Royal Bank would be expanding its operations in Europe beyond the project finance it currently offers.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking at one or two other things that we're not quite free to talk about yet but we are not into acquiring networks or anything like that,&quot; he said, adding the bank's strategy was to sell the specialist expertise it had developed in other markets.</p>
<p>Royal Bank's bad debt provision rose 32 million pounds to 77 million pounds but Mathewson said this was not an underlying trend because a year before it reflected a big write-back from Citizens and it now included formula driven provisions from the bank's credit card business.</p>
<p>And while the UK banking operations cost/income ratio, which fell by four percentage points, would continue to come down &quot;in the fullness of time&quot;, the bank's custody business would increase it in the short term.</p>
<p>At the branch level rationalisation would continue, with the trend being towards fewer people working in branches but expansion in other areas, but no plans to cut branches.</p>
<p>Mathewson also dismissed any suggestion that Royal Bank might be taken over by a larger bank or merge with Bank of Scotland.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it(a takeover) is out of the question. Firstly our performance is such that it does not merit takeover. Secondly a hostile bid would be immensely expensive and of doubtful value because of the effect it would have on our customers,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>And while co-operation with Bank of Scotland where the result was financially beneficial to both parties was both logical and sensible, Mathewson said any suggestion of a merger was &quot;fairyland&quot;, not least because the government would never allow such a concentration.</p>
