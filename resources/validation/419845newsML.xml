<title>UK: London precious metals seen in narrow range.</title>
<headline>London precious metals seen in narrow range.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-04</dateline>

<p>Precious metals prices were forecast to move in fairly narrow ranges on Tuesday but dealers warned that last week's volatility could return.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been quiet yesterday and today but the volatility will return although it may take a couple of days,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $361.75 per ounce following $362.15 on Monday afternoon having received little impetus since the close.</p>
<p>New York spot closed lower at $361.70/$362.20 after gold and silver hit early highs and Tokyo and Hong Kong finished just above the U.S. closing figure influenced by the weaker yen, short covering and late profittaking.</p>
<p>Testimony from U.S. federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was expected to cover issues touched last week, dealers said.</p>
<p>Continuing fund short covering looked like the best chance gold had to climb through the $360s, dealers said.</p>
<p>Since bullion bottomed at its 3-3/4 year low on February 12 at $336.90 it has climbed to within $5.00 of its opening year level (the Jan 2 fix was $367.80, the 1997 high to date).</p>
<p>Meanwhile Comex's &quot;large trader&quot; net short positions fell to 21,241 contracts by February 25 from 46,650 two weeks earlier, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p>
<p>&quot;Fund short covering will dominate the market. The producers may see the rise and sell into it so we could have a volatile price,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the fund-driven momentum could take gold prices through the $370s, the dealer said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile gold was seen in a $358.00-$364.00 with physical support holding the downside.</p>
<p>Silver was largely ignored at $5.28/$5.30 having seen most of its action late on Monday in New York when it was bought up to about $5.40 and promptly sold into.</p>
<p>On Monday the gold-silver ratio was about 68 having gone from 65 to 70 mid February before being sold off.</p>
<p>&quot;If it goes below 64, it could be heading for 57.30,&quot; said technical analyst Karen Jones at Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
<p>Palladium was steady at $150.00/$151.00, $4.50 down on Monday's close which was inflated by a brief bought of buying.</p>
<p>&quot;Palladium is probably supporting the whole complex,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Mixed reports on the severity and impact of a strike at Russia's Norislk plant this month and the still delayed start to Russia-Japan supply talks underpin the price, dealers said.</p>
<p>Platinum was $2.50 easier at $386.50/$387.50.</p>
