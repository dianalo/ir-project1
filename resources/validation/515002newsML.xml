<p>Philippines President Fidel Ramos said on Wednesday he had full confidence Indonesia would unravel the mystery surrounding the death of a Filipino geologist who helped discover the controversial Busang gold property.</p>
<p>He said he was sure Indonesian authorities would transmit to the Philippine government the full results of their investigation into the fall from a helicopter last month of Michael de Guzman, chief geologist for Canadian firm Bre-X Minerals Ltd.</p>
<p>Some Indonesian officials have said de Guzman's death appeared to be a suicide but his family in Manila said they doubted he would take his own life.</p>
<p>&quot;We are awaiting the official report of the Indonesian government in which we have full confidence in unravelling mystery,&quot; Ramos told his weekly news conference.</p>
<p>Asked if the government had received any report that would suggest de Guzman's death was other than suicide, Ramos said: &quot;None yet because the investigation by the Indonesian government is not complete.&quot;</p>
<p>De Guzman helped discover in the Busang jungles on Borneo island what Bre-X at first said were gold reserves estimated at 70.95 million ounces, worth $25 billion at current prices.</p>
<p>That would make the discovery the biggest gold strike in the world this century.</p>
<p>De Guzman's plunge from a helicopter flying him to the gold site and a statement by Bre-X that it was possible the amount of gold at the property had been overstated shocked the mining world.</p>
<p>Bre-X has a 45 percent stake in Busang, while its partner, Freeport McMoran Copper and Gold Inc of the United States holds 15 percent. Indonesian interests hold the rest.</p>
<p>Indonesian and Philippine investigators have carried out two separate autopsies on de Guzman's remains.</p>
<p>A brother of de Guzman said on Monday the family had not yet received the results of the investigation but promised to make them public.</p>
