<p>The mass suicide by the Heaven's Gate cult in California has left America's New Age devotees shocked but unshaken in a host of quirky beliefs, from the existence of angels to the impending onset of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Angel Times magazine was so concerned by the 39 deaths in Rancho Santa Fe, outside San Diego, this week that it rushed out a press release decrying an early media report saying cult members saw themselves as angels leaving their earthly forms.</p>
<p>&quot;My position is that God's angels can materialise in human form, to deliver a message or for your protection as a guardian angel. But then they dematerialize instantly,&quot; Linda Vephula, the Atlanta-based quarterly's editor-in-chief, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, if these guys (in California) were truly angels, they would not leave their bodies behind. So I disagree with them referring to themselves as angels.&quot;</p>
<p>Aside from the magazine, Vephula's staff produces a directory of dealers in angel paraphernalia. It is known as &quot;The Angel Yellow Pages&quot; and is available through the Internet.</p>
<p>Like Vephula, ardent subscribers to New Age beliefs lamented the Heaven's Gate suicide but argued it could have been avoided had cult members believed in the true spiritual realm.</p>
<p>&quot;This certainly is a tragic incident,&quot; said Gail Armstrong, spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology, a U.S.-based international religion. (Corrects to delete reference to suicide and bankruptcy).</p>
<p>She ascribed the Heaven's Gate suicide to &quot;a view of the world in which one is searching to attain an afterlife. Were people to have a greater understanding of themselves and what surrounds them, you would not see this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's sad that these things happen and that people are so misguided,&quot; said the Rev. James Love, an independent minister who believes the Germanic and Celtic races to be the lost tribes of Israel. &quot;People don't realise that there is evidence in Scripture about supernatural powers. The concept of space travel is not unscriptural or unbiblical at all, though whether there's a spaceship hiding behind a comet I don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>Cult experts believe there are as many as 3,500 groups in the United States promoting beliefs from unidentified flying objects (UFOs) to astrology, Eastern transcendentalism, white supremacy, the power of crystals and the intelligence of plant life.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is trying to get a nose-count of how many people are in these groups. There's no consensus on that. Some guess it's as high as 2.5 million people and some say it's less,&quot; said Hal Mansfield, who heads the Religious Movements Resource Centre in Fort Collins, Colorado.</p>
<p>And even an accurate count of cult members would not include the untold number of people drawn to paranormal subjects through supermarket tabloids and television shows such as &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;Touched by an Angel.&quot;</p>
<p>By far the fastest-growing feature in the firmament of the American cult movement is millennialism, a belief that the year 2000 is in some way a harbinger of great turmoil for humankind if not the end of time itself, the experts say.</p>
<p>Millennialism spans a host of otherwise incongruous New Age groups from UFO enthusiasts and neo-Christians to citizens' militiamen who fear a U.N. takeover of the United States.</p>
<p>Bomb investigators in Atlanta believe those responsible for three bombings over the past nine months could be part of the white supremacist Christian Identity movement, which sees itself embroiled in a final battle between Good and Evil.</p>
<p>Astrology has an answer for anyone wondering why so many unusual beliefs have come bubbling to the surface now: the Earth is being hit with giant stress waves generated by astronomic events such as the movement of the planet Pluto inside Neptune's orbital path.</p>
<p>Joan Schleicher, executive director of the Anodos Foundation, a group dedicated to the cosmologist teachings of the late Arthur Young, said she and her colleagues do not believe in a coming apocalypse. But astrological forces confronting the human race could help propel people toward the next stage of evolutionary development -- if they are of the right mettle -- she said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some chaos going on inside individuals who are unable to take advantage of the opportunity and rise up out of themselves and grow quickly,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;With these folks who commit suicide or just flip out it's fear and then it becomes greed and then it's, well, we'll just seize control. And the ultimate control to seize is to kill yourself and everybody around you.&quot;</p>
