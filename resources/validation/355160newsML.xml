<p>A massive container ship carrying 800,000 gallons (3 million litres) of fuel ran aground in a fragile marine sanctuary south of the Florida Keys on Monday, U.S. Coast Guard officials said.</p>
<p>The vessel, on its way to spain from New Orleans, damaged coral reefs but did not leak any of the fuel it was carrying, officials said.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard said booms were not set up around the grounded ship, owned by the Strachan Co of Louisiana, because there was no indication the vessel's hull had been holed. Tug boats were at the scene to attempt to refloat the vessel at high tide.</p>
<p>The 600-foot (200-metre) Liberian-flagged Houston was stuck 12 miles (19 km) southeast of Key West in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, a protected area surrounding the small islands on Florida's south end.</p>
<p>The grounding came less than a week after Florida's governor and Cabinet gave its approval to the federal sanctuary, which was first proposed following a series of ship groundings off the Keys in 1989.</p>
<p>Initial assessments by divers indicated the vessel had damaged corals in the area.</p>
<p>&quot;Coral life that took hundreds of years to develop got wiped out in a matter of moments,&quot; Nature Conservancy marine biologist Paul Dye said.</p>
<p>Coral reefs, created by tiny creatures called coral polyps, grow slowly, at a rate of only a couple of inches (5 cm) a year, scientists say, and ship damage can take decades to regenerate.</p>
<p>The ship, travelling at about 16 knots, hit the reef about 5:30 a.m. (1030 GMT) Monday several miles (km) inside a shipping exclusion zone that bars vessels longer than 155 feet (50 metres), officials said. A freighter bound for Europe from New Orleans typically would have been far out to sea while passing Florida.</p>
<p>The zone was established by the U.S. government after three ship groundings in the Florida Keys in an 18-day period in 1989.</p>
<p>The ship's bow was embedded in sea bottom comprised of sand and about 20 percent hard and soft corals, Ben Haskell, science coordinator for the sanctuary, said.</p>
<p>The incident proved a close call for the Western Sambos ecological reserve, several miles (km) to the southwest. The 9-sq-mile (23-sq-km) area of teeming sea life is considered the heart of the lower Keys reef system.</p>
<p>Jack Sobel, ecosystems director for the Centre for Marine Conservation in Washington, said the sanctuary protection offered the chance to force ship owners to pay for the damage their vessels cause to coral reefs.</p>
<p>&quot;Vessels this size are not supposed to be running in that area,&quot; Sobel said. &quot;They are now liable for large civil fines for having done that.&quot;</p>
