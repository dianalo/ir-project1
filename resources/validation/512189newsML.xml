<headline>Angell questions if Fed will hike rates May 20.</headline>

<p>Former Federal Reserve Board Governor Wayne Angell said Wednesday that he had doubts that the Federal Reserve would raise rates again when it meets on May 20.</p>
<p>Speaking briefly with reporters prior to remarks before a trade conference, Angell said, &quot;I'll have to admit, that there is one chance in three that they will do so.&quot; He said it was more likely that the Fed would move in July or August.  </p>
<p>Angell, chief economist at Bear Stearns and Co Inc, said he believed that the recent retreat of the stock market may have satisfied, at least for now, Fed concerns that too much liquidity was being added to the system.</p>
<p>He said that he believes three conditions have to be met before the Fed would find it necessary to increase rates when the Federal Open Market Committee meets next month.</p>
<p>First, he said, the economy would have to remain very strong. There also would have to be visible evidence of inflation and the stock market would have to be revived to a point that the Fed found troubling.  </p>
<p>The strong dollar, which Angell said he saw continuing, reflects the vibrant U.S. economy and interest rates differentials between the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>He said that one effect of this was that it produced significant corporate discipline on U.S. companies that hoped to compete overseas.</p>
