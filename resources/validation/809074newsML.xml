<p>Swedish mining and rubber company Trelleborg on Tuesday posted a sharp rise in first half profits due to a 1.46 billion crown capital gain from the sale of 55.1 percent in mining unit Boliden.</p>
<p>Trelleborg posted a pre-tax profit of 2.00 billion crowns against 657 million crowns a year ago.  </p>
<p>The market had expected a profit of 2.16 billion crowns, including a capital gain of about 1.5 billion crowns.</p>
<p>But Trelleborg said its operating profit including associated interests but disregarding capital gains or restructuring income or costs, rose by 170 million crowns to 733 million crowns during the six-month period.</p>
<p>It repeated its forecasts for a better result in 1997 than a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;We estimate that the full year result for 1997, excluding restructuring costs, will be better than in 1996,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Trelleborg's share price was flat at 127.5 crowns in mixed trade in the lead up to the report.</p>
<p>Trelleborg reported sales of 11.82 billion crowns for the six months against 10.54 billion crowns a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;For comparable units sales were largely unchanged,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>Sales revenue from Boliden fell during the six months to 4.02 billion crowns from 4.28 billion, largely due to lower metal prices which were not fully compensated by higher currency rates.</p>
<p>In July this year, Trelleborg sold a 55.1 percent stake of wholly-owned mining unit Boliden through an initial public offering in Canada that raised CA$878 million.</p>
<p>The offering, which allowed investors to pay for the stock in two instalments, comprised 54.9 million shares at $16 each. Boliden has since been listed as an 'instalment receipt' in Toronto.</p>
<p>Trelleborg reported a capital gain of 1.46 billion crowns from the sale which was included in restructuring credits of 1.30 billion crowns on the first half balance sheet.</p>
<p>Sales from its rubber division, Trelleborg Industri, rose 44 percent  to 3.33 billion crowns from 2.31 billion crowns as a result of acquisitions and favourable exchange rate movements.</p>
<p>Sales from the company's distribution unit, Trelltrade, were largely unchanged at 3.74 billion crowns against 3.72 billion crowns a year ago.</p>
<p>Trelleborg posted earnings per share of 13.40 crowns from 4.05 crowns a year earlier.</p>
