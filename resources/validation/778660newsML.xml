<p>Mexico may face an impasse during thorny negotiations over the 1998 budget and other issues when its divided Congress meets for the first time, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Tuesday.</p>
<p>During a two-day visit to Mexico, Summers said he was pleased with Mexico's progress in moving toward a true multiparty system, after the country's landmark July 6 elections stripped the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of a seven-decade majority in the lower house.  </p>
<p>Mexican financial markets have surged since the elections, but some analysts fear that the country's inexperience with multiparty rule may bring deadlock or backsliding on reform after Congress convenes in September.</p>
<p>&quot;Multipartisanship obviously offers opportunities to cement consensus more formally around sound policy, but it also carries with it the risk of impasse,&quot; the senior Treasury official said when asked whether protracted congressional negotiations, such as over Mexico's 1998 budget, might loom as a potential stumbling block for the markets.  </p>
<p>&quot;Markets will obviously be watching developments in Mexico very closely,&quot; Summers said at a media briefing. &quot;(But) it would be a serious error to suppose multipartisanship was inherently more risky or divisive than we've seen elsewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>Based on U.S. experience, he said there was no reason why a divided Congress could not have a vigorous debate on the economy, nor why that should undermine economic stability.</p>
<p>He conceded that markets often changed course abruptly, but he said Mexico had taken measures to help protect itself against the volatility of capital flows.  </p>
<p>&quot;Markets over time do tend to move with fundamentals, but you have a lot of swings reflecting changes in judgment,&quot; he said. &quot;The important fact is that Mexico has lengthened the maturity of its debt and accumulated substantial international reserves, and it has worked down its short-term liabilities coming due.&quot;</p>
<p>Summers -- who played a key role in constructing the U.S. aid package that helped bail Mexico out of its 1994 devaluation crisis -- said his two-day visit came at an important political moment for Mexico.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is a juncture when the political environment in Mexico has been profoundly altered to one requiring multiparty decision-making, and at a juncture where Mexico is creating long-term and substantial growth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>To be sure, he conceded the recovery was taking time to filter down to the pockets of ordinary Mexicans, whose impatience with the pace of economic improvement and the depth of recession hurt the PRI at the polls last month.  </p>
<p>&quot;The shock in 1994 and 1995 was a profound one, and I think the financial system and its problems have tended to make it difficult for smaller businesses to attract capital on a large scale, and that has tended to slow the economy down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he said Washington was encouraged by Mexico's growth rate, which would soon allow the benefits of recovery to be felt more widely.</p>
<p>Summers said on Monday in a speech there was no reason why Mexico's economy should not grow by five percent or more, as the government has targeted.</p>
<p>Still, he warned that Mexico needed to remain on guard, even though the economy has enjoyed substantial capital inflows amid positive sentiment characteristic of the middle of Mexico's six-year presidential term.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly the challenge for policy will be to remain vigilant to any imbalances that arise, and be prepared to adjust to any shocks that come rapidly and be conservative given the fact that sentiment can change quickly and brutally,&quot; he said.</p>
