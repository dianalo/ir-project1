<title>USA: TCF Financial authorized shares increased.</title>
<headline>TCF Financial authorized shares increased.</headline>
<dateline>MINNEAPOLIS 1997-04-23</dateline>

<p>TCF Financial Corp said Wednesday that shareholders at the annual meeting approved an increased in the number of authorized shares to 140 million from 70 million.</p>
<p>At the end of the first quarter, the bank holding company had 35.2 million diluted shares outstanding.</p>
<p>The company said it has not earmarked a specific use for the increased shares.  </p>
<p>William Cooper, chairman and chief executive, was asked by a shareholder during the meeting if he had been approached to sell the company.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be inappropriate for me to answer if anybody's been around,&quot; Cooper said, adding, &quot;But TCF is not for sale. We could probably get a 20 percent boost were we to sell the company. But it doesn't make any sense to take a one-time jump and then get mediocre returns with other people running our money.&quot;  </p>
<p>Before the meeting, Cooper told Reuters that consumer loans would continue to grow as a proportion of total loans. &quot;Our consumer loans are growing at about 10 or 12 percent (per year). So they'll be a couple percent higher of total loans by the end of the year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However, Cooper said consumer loans would not be as high as 40 perent of total loans. In the first quarter of 1997 --and in all of 1996--consumer loans accounted for 36 percent of total loans, up from 30 percent in 1995.  </p>
<p>Cooper said the provision for credit losses would be significantly less in 1997 than in 1996. &quot;Our provision (for credit losses) in the first quarter is lower than it's going to be in subsequent quarters, with the acquisition of Bank of Chicago in the first quarter boosting our reserves. But I'm confident that our provision for the year is going to be substantially lower than last year,&quot; the executive said.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, the provision for credit losses was $1.09 million versus $2.8 million a year ago. In all of 1996, the provision was $19.8 million.</p>
<p>Cooper said non-interest income would continue to assume a larger portion of total revenues. &quot;I think that (non-interest income) will grow between 10 and 15 percent for the year (as a share of total revenues). I wouldn't be surprised to see it up at the 25 percent level by the fourth quarter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the 1997 first quarter, non-interest income was 22 percent of total revenues versus 21 percent in 1996.</p>
