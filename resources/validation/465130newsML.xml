<p>Dutch shipbuilding and engineering group Royal Schelde, with its eye on energy and waste disposal projects, says it expects Southeast Asia to account for 25 percent of its sales and net profits by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>&quot;Southeast Asia should account for 25 percent of our activity and net profits in three to four years' time,&quot; the chairman of the board of management, Robert van den Heuvel, said on Monday.</p>
<p>The company, 90 percent held by the Dutch government and 10 percent by the Zeeland provincial administration through two foundations, had its roots in shipbuilding, he told Reuters. Over the past 15 months, however, it had reshaped its philosophy and given each of its sectors responsibility for its own expansion and marketing.</p>
<p>The sectors cover shipbuilding, with the aim of a 60 percent commercial and 40 percent naval mix, the systems division including the design, engineering and manufacture of boilers and installations for energy and waste plants, and a plant construction division.</p>
<p>Van den Heuvel said Royal Schelde saw opportunities in the region in the energy sector, waste management, and possibly shipping and shipbuilding.</p>
<p>In the energy sector, he said, &quot;the growth in the world is rather in Southeast Asia than anywhere else.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Royal Schelde, which opened an office in Jakarta on Monday after a gap of about 10 years, had identified a particular opportunity in Indonesia in the energy sector for the provision of plants producing 20 to 40 megawatts of power.</p>
<p>He said big industry supplying massive power plants in the 600 megawatt range were already well represented.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an open field between, let's say, 10 megawatts and 250 megawatts. In that area, you are talking about 20-to-30-to-40 megawatt installations which are able to power large factories or industrial estates, or units...like office blocks.</p>
<p>&quot;That's an area which has come in our mind as one that Royal Schelde could expand in, given the right partner and given the right strategy,&quot; van den Heuvel said.</p>
<p>Talks with prospective partners were already under way.</p>
<p>He said waste management was another area for potential expansion, and Royal Schelde already had experience in this in Europe, including producing energy from household waste.</p>
<p>While waste disposal might not be a top priority for the burgeoning and congested cities in the region today, &quot;they will have...in 10 years time an enormous waste problem -- you can't dump it all in the sea or put it in land fills&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;And also, those countries will come to a level like in Western Europe where everybody is looking for alternative ways to resource energy, not only by coal and natural gas and resources that could be limited in 50 years from now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Royal Schelde chairman noted that the group had supplied the Indonesian navy with four corvettes and six frigates, and could provide patrol craft of between 600 and 1,400 tonnes that could be of use in the region.</p>
<p>He also said the group was producing fast, light ferries that could be used through the Indonesian archipelago and along coastal Malaysia.</p>
<p>&quot;We are talking to both ship owners and industrial groups, and also yards -- also in Singapore and Malaysia -- about how to set up this in Southeast Asia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Royal Schelde has a 36 percent interest in Malaysia's KNM Steel Construction Sdn Bhd.</p>
