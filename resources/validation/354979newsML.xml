<headline>FOCUS-Euro stocks mixed amid interest rate anxiety.</headline>

<p>European stocks closed mixed on Tuesday as investors faced an anxious wait for news on U.S. interest rates, the issue which has haunted this year's bull runs.</p>
<p>The dollar held firm in tight ranges, with dealers likewise transfixed by a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-making arm starting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>With the United States apparently enjoying low-inflation economic growth, logic dictates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should leave rates unchanged when it meets.</p>
<p>But markets face a long wait to hear whether logic will prevail as no announcement on rates is expected until the two-day meeting ends late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, the DAX index actually closed at a record high of 3,067.06. But that was a rise of 4.77 points or just 0.16 percent and across the continent turnover was low.</p>
<p>French shares failed to sustain an early rise and the CAC-40 closed down 5.48 points at 2,503.07.</p>
<p>London tried to cling on to its early gains, but a lower Wall Street -- the Dow Jones industrial average was down 21.71 at 6,783.46 as Europe closed -- took its toll.</p>
<p>The FTSE-100 index had slipped from morning highs to close up a scant 3.1 points at 4,260.9.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very dull. People want to get the FOMC out of the way before doing anything,&quot; one market maker said. &quot;It would be a nasty shock if the Fed put up rates this week.&quot;</p>
<p>But three years ago to the day, the Fed delivered just such a nasty shock, raising interest rates just when the market least expected them.</p>
<p>Stock prices plunged around the globe in response and this time nobody wants to get caught out.</p>
<p>In London, investors have their own worries as British monetary authorities are scheduled to hold a regular meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Economists expect finance minister Kenneth Clarke to continue resisting a rate rise so close to the election which must be held by the end of May. But Bank of England governor Eddie George has called for higher interest rates to nip inflation in the bud.</p>
<p>&quot;If anybody is looking for a change in rates it will probably be here rather than in the U.S.,&quot; said one London dealer. &quot;But neither looks very likely.&quot;</p>
<p>Stocks have stormed ahead this year but any interest rate rise, which would make investments other than shares more attractive, could throw markets both side of the Atlantic into reverse.</p>
<p>The approaching results season in the Britain is also keeping investors sidelined as worries persist over whether sterling's strength will hit exporters.</p>
<p>The story was much the same on foreign exchange markets. The dollar was muted, its movements small as the market awaited the FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;We're unlikely to hear anything from the FOMC today and chances are pretty slim of a rate rise this week anyway,&quot; said Michael Burke, economist at Citibank.</p>
<p>Yet Burke believed the dollar was just taking a breather before pushing higher again.</p>
<p>A weekend meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven industrial nations was unlikely to put obstacles in the way of recent trends, whatever its opinion of the pace of dollar gains, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the day, the U.S. still seems fully committed to its strong dollar policy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.6425 marks and 122.28 yen at the European close, down from its late Monday European level of 1.6436 marks but up from 121.83 yen.</p>
<p>Gold showed some unaccustomed strength in the morning with dealers saying it had been oversold.</p>
<p>But as so often, it did not last long. By the close bullion was at $346.25 an ounce from a morning fix at $346.30 and unchanged from Monday's close.</p>
