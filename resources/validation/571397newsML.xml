<headline>OPINION - POLISH NOBE MACROECONOMIC FORECAST.</headline>
<text>
<p>NOBE Independent Centre for Economic Studies</p>
<p>Quarterly forecasts of the economic development of Poland</p>
<p>The Polish economy was growing by more than 7 percent</p>
<p>during the last two quarters. However, the fast growth was</p>
<p>accompanied by a rapid deterioration of the current account</p>
<p>balance and the growing trade deficit. The level of the current</p>
<p>account deficit is still acceptable but the negative trend</p>
<p>should be stopped over the next 6-12 months to avoid more</p>
<p>serious economic perturbations. The growth of domestic credit</p>
<p>and consumption should be slowed down to stabilise the curent</p>
<p>account deficit at the level below four percent of GDP. In our</p>
<p>view no drastic policy measures are necessary to achieve this</p>
<p>target. However, some policy moves are unavoidable and likely</p>
<p>to take place despite the coming general elections.</p>
<p>Four main factors influenced the economic performance of</p>
<p>Poland in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Firstly, the dynamics of domestic consumption remained very</p>
<p>high both due to a fast growth of wages and consumer credit as</p>
<p>well as because of the continuing investment boom. Total growth</p>
<p>of domestic consumption exceeded 11 percent compared to the</p>
<p>same period year ago.</p>
<p>Secondly, the rapid growth was accompanied by even faster</p>
<p>increase in imports (above 20 percent), in a large part due to</p>
<p>purchases of capital goods.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the growth rates of exports started to pick up</p>
<p>slowly. Nevertheless, as the dynamics of imports remained still</p>
<p>significantly higher than the dynamics of exports, the external</p>
<p>balance deteriorated considerably. The balance of payments</p>
<p>trade deficit increased during the last six months by almost $6</p>
<p>billion and the current account deficit by $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>Fourthly, inflationary pressure kept falling despite the</p>
<p>fast demand growth and a relatively expansionary monetary</p>
<p>policy.</p>
<p>The observed growth pattern is not sustainable over the</p>
<p>longer period. The deterioration of the external balance has</p>
<p>not reached dangerous levels yet, could cause problems 4-5</p>
<p>quarters from now if it countinues to worsen. However, we are</p>
<p>relatively optimistic, as there are reasons to believe that the</p>
<p>situation may improve without drastic policy measures.</p>
<p>1. The trade deficit is growing rapidly, but its level is</p>
<p>still acceptable. A trade deficit is a normal phenomenon in a</p>
<p>fast growing economy importing foreign capital. The current</p>
<p>account deficit was about one percent of GDP in 1996 and is</p>
<p>likely to grow to 3.5-3.8 percent in 1997. This is still a</p>
<p>level that can be comfortably financed by capital inflows.</p>
<p>However, any further deterioration in 1998 may be</p>
<p>dangerous. That means, that although Poland has got some room</p>
<p>for manoeuvre to accomodate the unavoidable deterioration of</p>
<p>the external account in 1997, the trend of the rapid</p>
<p>deterioration should be stopped over the next four quarters.</p>
<p>2. We expect some improvement in exports to take place</p>
<p>mainly due to the faster growth in Western Europe and despite</p>
<p>the weak German Mark. Such an improvement will not be enough to</p>
<p>restore the external equilibrium of Poland, but may help to</p>
<p>curb the growth of the deficit.</p>
<p>3. Under these circumstances current growth rates of</p>
<p>investment and consumer demand (over 20 percent and almost 8</p>
<p>percent respectively) are not sustainable over the longer</p>
<p>period. Our assessment is that the growth of investment should</p>
<p>gradually cool down to 12-15 percent over the next four</p>
<p>quarters and the growth of consumption to about five percent.</p>
<p>4. No drastic policy measures are necessary or desirable to</p>
<p>achieve this target. Monetary policy is the key here. As growth</p>
<p>of domestic credit should be curbed, there is no room for</p>
<p>interest rate cuts. To the contrary, NBP may slightly increase</p>
<p>the basic rates in the coming months, or continue using other</p>
<p>instruments that increase the price of money. Probably no</p>
<p>one-off devaluation will be necessary, and the crawling peg</p>
<p>will continue at its present rate of one percent a month.</p>
<p>The crawl is unlikely to be be cut below 0.9-1 percent a</p>
<p>month over the next four quarters. Finally, as the budget</p>
<p>deficit is still under control, we do not see reasons for</p>
<p>fiscal adjustment. With a slowdown in GDP growth, and low</p>
<p>inflation, the budget may find itself under some pressure in</p>
<p>the second half of 1997. The deficit, even if the target is</p>
<p>exceeded, should not reach three percent of GDP.</p>
<p>As the outcome of current trends and policy changes we</p>
<p>expect the growth rate of domestic consumption to slow down to</p>
<p>seven percent in the last quarter of 1997 on lower investment</p>
<p>growth and lower private consumption.</p>
<p>The growth rate of exports is not likely to exceed that of</p>
<p>imports before 1998. GDP growth will fall to about five percent</p>
<p>in the last quarter of 1997. The annual growth rate in 1997</p>
<p>will be about six percent, very similar to GDP growth in 1996.</p>
<p>GDP growth may start picking up only after the trend of current</p>
<p>account deterioration is stopped.</p>

<p>Table 2 shows projected inflationary developments in the</p>
<p>next four quarters. Weakening indexation mechainsms, more rigid</p>
<p>monetary policy, and possible slow growth of food prices will</p>
<p>result in the continuous slowdown of consumer prices. The</p>
<p>process of the general fall of inflationary expectations may be</p>
<p>significantly disrupted if devaluation expectations due to the</p>
<p>lack of a transparent exchange rate policy.</p>
<p>Producer price growth will stabilize around 11 percent. The</p>
<p>fall of PPI will resume in 1998 (to a one-digit level) after</p>
<p>the crawling peg devaluation of the zloty is slowed down below</p>
<p>0.9 percent in a month.</p>
