<p>The Zimbabwe dollar closed Monday's interbank session easier on the U.S. dollar but dealers said normality seemed to be returning to the market after the local currency went on a free-fall stretching over a week on the back of import pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates are still high but the situation seems to be returning to normal though it hasn't completely normalised as yet,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The Zimbabwe dollar lost some 10 cents in little over a week on the back of import pressure compounded by central bank governor Leonard Tsumba's statements published in a financial newspaper twe Fridays ago that the unit was overvalued against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>At some point during the period dealers were quoting bid/offer spreads as wide as 20 points to protect their foreign currency reserves.</p>
<p>At Monday's close, the Zimbabwe dollar was quoted at 11.6350/6550 on the U.S. dollar, weaker compared to Friday's 11.5700/6700 but a point away from the normal one-point spread.</p>
<p>On the crosses, it was quoted firmer against sterling at 18.9500/9780 from 19.0170/0230, tracking a stronger U.S. dollar overseas and was at 6.2300/2380 from 6.3130/3175 versus the mark and at 2.4980/5020 against South Africa's rand from 2.5290/5325.</p>
