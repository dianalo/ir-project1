<p>The crew of the troubled Russian space station Mir spent most of Monday repairing a malfunctioning oxygen system as a two-man relief crew prepared to blast off, officials said.</p>
<p>The Elektron oxygen generating unit aboard the 11-year-old station was shutting down when activated, perhaps because of air trapped in one of its pumps, NASA reported on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;They're still working on the Elektron,&quot; NASA spokeswoman Kathleen Maliga said on Monday evening from Mission Control outside Moscow. &quot;They spent most of the day working on that.&quot;</p>
<p>The Mir is running on partial power after the worst accident in its history when it collided with a supply ship on June 25.</p>
<p>It has two oxygen systems but the back-up is in the Kvant-2 module, which was shut down to preserve energy, Maliga said.</p>
<p>The crew was planning to release some oxygen from canisters on board, and engineers at Mission Control were studying the matter.</p>
<p>Asked if the oxygen situation on board was a problem, Maliga said: &quot;Not yet...Eventually you obviously need it to work.&quot;</p>
<p>As the current crew focused on the latest troubles that have plagued the ageing Mir, veteran commander Anatoly Solovyov, 49, and flight engineer Pavel Vinogradov, 43, prepared to blast off from Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1532 GMT on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is going according to schedule,&quot; said Boris Kryuchkov, deputy director of Russia's Star City cosmonaut training centre outside Moscow. &quot;They are undergoing a final check of documents, physical tests, and they will also rest.&quot;</p>
<p>After they dock on Thursday, the two cosmonauts will undertake vital repairs that will determine the future of the world's only space station.</p>
<p>On August 20, they are scheduled to don spacesuits and enter Mir's punctured and airless Spektr module, which was hit in the June accident, to try to reattach interior cables linked to the solar panels outside.</p>
<p>Vinogradov, who is flying in space for the first time, will open the hatch to the module. Space officials say he may face dangerous floating chemicals or debris, and a puncture in his space suit could mean a swift death.</p>
<p>Solovyov said on Sunday he was &quot;absolutely sure&quot; he and his crew mate would be able to restore power to the stricken craft.</p>
<p>U.S. astronaut Michael Foale, the third member of the crew, will wait in the Soyuz escape vehicle during the repair. He is due to leave Mir in late September.</p>
<p>On September 3 the two cosmonauts plan to make a spacewalk to inspect the puncture from the outside. They will return at a later date to make the repair.</p>
<p>NASA's Maliga said the current crew -- whose Russian members have been in orbit since February -- had decided to give up trying to repair two of the 12 &quot;gyrodynes&quot; which control the station's orientation automatically. Instead, two new ones will be brought on board.</p>
<p>When the two Russian cosmonauts now on board, commander Vasily Tsibliyev and engineer Alexander Lazutkin, return to Earth on August 14, they will also bring samples of water from the ship's urine recycling system for analysis, NASA said.</p>
<p>The system has been turned off to save energy, and officials want to make sure that water recycled earlier is still drinkable.</p>
