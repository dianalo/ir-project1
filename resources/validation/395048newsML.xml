<p>The judge in the Oklahoma City bombing trial on Thursday denied a defence request to have key eyewitness testimony excluded from the upcoming trials.</p>
<p>&quot;The test is -- is it unreasonable for fair-minded jurors to believe their testimony. I can't say it is,&quot; the judge said when he announced his decision in court.</p>
<p>The judge's ruling came at the end of a 2-1/2 day pre-trial hearing on whether to admit the eyewitness testimony.</p>
<p>Defence attorneys argued that the memories of the eyewitnesses were tainted by pre-trial publicity and that it appeared that some of them had changed their accounts after speaking with prosecutors.</p>
<p>Timothy McVeigh and former army buddy Terry Nichols are charged in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in April 1995, which killed 168 people.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Richard Matsch said the question was whether fundamental fairness to the defendants required him to suppress the testimony.</p>
<p>He said none of the eyewitnesses was expected to place McVeigh at the Murrah building, and that their testimony would instead be used by the government to establish a chain of circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p>In the end, Matsch said, the jury will &quot;judge the credibility of all the witnesses.&quot;</p>
<p>McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, told reporters the judge's decision was a &quot;disappointment&quot; but said it was not significant.</p>
<p>Among the eight eyewitnesses prosecutors are expected to call is an auto mechanic who identified McVeigh as the man who allegedly rented a Ryder truck believed to have been used in the bombing.</p>
<p>On Thursday prosecution witness Frederick Schlender, a manager of an agriculture cooperative in McPherson, Kansas, testified that he was &quot;better than 50 percent&quot; sure that a man he sold ammonium nitrate to was Nichols. The government has said the ammonium nitrate, a fertiliser, was used to make the bomb.</p>
<p>But Schlender came under heavy questioning from Nichols' attorney, Ron Woods. Schlender has changed or added to his account of the sale on several fronts, including the description of a truck used to pick up the fertiliser.</p>
<p>Woods, a former U.S. Attorney in Houston, said Schlender had been &quot;manipulated&quot; by prosecutors.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect that behaviour from the FBI ... I don't expect that kind of behaviour out of federal prosecutors,&quot; Woods told the judge.</p>
<p>Schlender had said in his grand jury testimony that the purchase of 2,000 tons of ammonium nitrate was not unusual, but now says that it was.</p>
<p>Also, Schlender said the fertiliser customer, who went by the name Mike Havens, told him he was farming near Durhan, Kansas, but Schlender had not told that to the grand jury in 1995. Durhan is near Herington, Kansas, where Nichols lived.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Scott Mendeloff denied in court that Schlender had been unduly influenced. &quot;There is no evidence in the record (to show manipulation) and that is not what happened. He (Schlender) was not led,&quot; Mendeloff said.</p>
<p>In a separate pre-trial hearing on Thursday afternoon, defence lawyers argued that FBI laboratory examiners should not be allowed to testify on explosives residue from the bomb because improper methods were used.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, who said the FBI examiners can testify that explosives residue was found on two shirts and one pair of pants belonging to McVeigh, denied that there was systemic contamination in the FBI lab.</p>
