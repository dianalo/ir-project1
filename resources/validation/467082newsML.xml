<p>Istanbul shares sank in sharply lower volume on Tuesday as renewed political concerns and higher yield in the Treasury's bond auction annoyed the market, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100 closed at 1,577, down 74 points, or 4.48 percent from Monday when it eased 0.18 percent after last week's 10.34 percent surge prompted by privatisation hopes after the fading of political tension.</p>
<p>Trade volume plunged to 26.15 trillion lira from Monday's 40.73 trillion.  </p>
<p>The index had lost 3.09 percent in morning sales prompted by political jitters which flared ahead of a National Security Council (MGK) meeting expected next week.</p>
<p>&quot;The market focused on political events and the upcoming MGK meeting in the absence of moving expectations. The bond auction results also showed that the yields are on the rise,&quot; said Cem Baycan from Delta securities.</p>
<p>The coalition government's Islamist wing opposes a plan to raise compulsory education to eight years from five as part of measures put forward at the military-dominated MGK's February 28 meeting to clamp down on rising Islamist activism.</p>
<p>The proposal almost completed by the education ministry has drawn protest from supporters of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's Islamist Welfare Party, who fear it will spell the end of religious schools.</p>
<p>The yield in the Treasury's 399-day bond auction jumped to 114.71 percent from 106.77 percent in last week's 399-day bond sale. The Treasury alloted 344.5 trillion lira of a total 377.3 trillion lira demand.</p>
<p>The results were in line with previous expectations that demand in the auction would be weak because of a persistent liquidity shortage and the paper's long maturity.</p>
<p>Bankers said the Treasury was forced to accept higher yields to meet its 189.3 trillion lira redemption on Wednesday after using all of the central bank cash advances available for 1997.</p>
<p>Banks will pay 145.6 trillion lira for the auction on Wednesday and cash in 189.3 trillion lira of maturing bills.</p>
<p>Of the 239 shares traded, falls sharply outdid rises by 203 to 17 and 19 finished stable. The IMKB Industrial shed 3.17 percent to 1,586, the IMKB Services dived 4.87 percent to 1,465 and the IMKB Financial plunged 5.36 percent to 1,677.</p>
<p>Leading actives were T.Isbank's C series, down 2,500 lira at 45,500, leading car maker Tofas, down 300 lira at 8,800 and readywear exporter EGS Dis Ticaret, down 2,500 lira at 26,500. They made 24 percent of the total turnover.</p>
