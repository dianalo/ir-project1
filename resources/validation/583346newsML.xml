<p>Imation Corp, the imaging and information products company spun off by Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co last year, said Wednesday it agreed to acquire software developer Cemax-Icon Inc for $30 million.  </p>
<p>In addition to the $30 million cash payment, Imation said it has agreed to pay an additional $49 million in cash or Imation stock over the next two years if certain milestones are met.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Imation plans to write off about $40 million in costs for research and development that already is in progress, it said. The acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase.</p>
<p>Without this one-time expense, Imation does not expect the deal to have any material impact on its revenues, income and earnings per share in 1997, the company said.  </p>
<p>But Cemax-Icon is expected to add to Imation's earnings in 1998 and beyond and to &quot;contribute positively to the company's economic profit improvement,&quot; Imation said in a statement.</p>
<p>Fremont, Calif.-based Cemax-Icon develops visualization and picture archiving software and systems. The company, which has 135 employees, was formed by the merger of Cemax Inc and ICON Medical Systems in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;By leveraging Cemax-Icon's proven technology platforms and integrating them with our global sales and service capabilities, Imation is uniquely positioned to deliver a completely integrated digital solution that includes capturing, viewing, printing, managing and storing images and clinical information, said Bill Monahan, chairman and chief executive of Imation.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close in the third quarter, Imation said. It is subject to state and federal regulatory approvals and Cemax-Icon shareholder approval.</p>
<p>&quot;This proposed transaction will extend the successful business partnership our two organizations have enjoyed over the past three years,&quot; said Terry Ross, Cemax-Icon's chief executive.</p>
