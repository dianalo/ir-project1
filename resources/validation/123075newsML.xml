<p>The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, pledged support on Thursday for a reduction of Mozambique's $5.5 billion foreign debt.</p>
<p>The debt was not sustainable and should be brought down &quot;to levels where it will not be an obstacle to the sustainable growth of the economy&quot;, Camdessus told a Maputo news conference at the end of a two-day visit.</p>
<p>He said money owing to multilateral bodies, notably the IMF and the World Bank, was a very substantial part of Mozambique's debt, but the IMF had nothing for which to apologise.</p>
<p>There were times in the past when the IMF and the World Bank were &quot;the only institutions prepared to take the risk of lending money to this country, to help overcome apparently insurmountable difficulties&quot;.</p>
<p>He added: &quot;We are proud to have done this. It helped to bring the country back on track.&quot;</p>
<p>Mozambique is regarded as one of the world's poorest countries following a protracted guerrilla war against Portuguese colonialists, which led to independence in 1975, followed by civil war which ended in 1992.</p>
<p>Camdessus said the IMF and the World Bank ...&quot;will agree to make important loans or grants in order to reduce what is owed to us to a sustainable level, provided all other creditors take a similar initiative&quot;.</p>
<p>In particular, Camdessus wanted the Paris Club of Western creditors to go beyond the &quot;Naples Terms&quot; of 67 percent debt reduction and offer 90 per cent reduction.</p>
<p>&quot;Where heavily indebted poor countries have demonstrated that they are doing all they can to adjust and reform their economies, we will make our contribution to debt reform.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that at a meeting of the IMF's interim committee in September there was &quot;universal consensus&quot; to back these ideas.</p>
<p>Mozambique embarked on a structural programme in 1987. Camdessus said he was sure that because of the government's commitment to this programme, the IMF's executive board would decide next year to make Mozambique eligible for &quot;this special debt initiative&quot;.</p>
<p>Camdessus gave no figure for multilateral debt reduction. &quot;The objective will be to bring the debt of each individual country down to a level of sustainability,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One guideline that might be used, he suggested, was that debt servicing should not amount to more than 20 or 25 percent of export earnings.</p>
<p>He said he had been impressed by the achievements of the Mozambican government. Data showed that structural adjustment was working.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth is there, at a continuously high level, exports are increasing at an impressive rate, the currency is very stable and the latest news on inflation is encouraging,&quot; he said.</p>
