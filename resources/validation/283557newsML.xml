<p>Last minute panic among British retailers about Christmas sales may have been unjustified, with the season of good cheer for store owners finally living up to expectations, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The surge in sales came late as Christmas fell in the middle of the week, allowing shoppers to leave their gift buying until Christmas eve if necessary.</p>
<p>Although the flood of Christmas trading statements from retailers has not started yet, analysts' verdict was that trading was reasonable, but not exceptional.</p>
<p>&quot;Christmas was fine, but not a bonanza,&quot; said one retail analyst who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Analysts said a clearer picture would emerge on Friday, when department store John Lewis Partnership publishes its latest weekly sales figures, a key indicator for the retail sector.</p>
<p>Last minute nerves hit retail stocks before Christmas, on fears that sales had slowed in December, after a buoyant November.</p>
<p>Britain's biggest clothing retailer Marks and Spencer Plc said it was happy with its performance. &quot;We traded to our expectations,&quot; said a spokeswoman, who added that January sales had started very well.</p>
<p>M&amp;S is due to publish a trading statement in the second or third week of January.</p>
<p>Fashion retailer Next Plc is expected to report by mid-January.</p>
<p>Department store group House of Fraser, also due to report on Christmas trade by mid-January, said it had had a very good start to its January sale.</p>
<p>Dixons Group Plc, is due to give its verdict on the festive season on January 8, when it publishes first half results.</p>
<p>Sears Plc and Argos Plc both report on January 10. A spokeswoman for Argos, the catalogue retailer, said its January sale had got off to a strong start, with sales better than expected. Top sellers included duvets, televisions, videos, child car seats, computer printers, as well as new lines of Barbie and Action Man.</p>
<p>Boots Co Plc reports on January 13, Body Shop International Plc and Kingfisher Plc on January 15, and Storehouse Plc on January 17.</p>
<p>Burton Group Plc will reveal how it fared over Christmas at its annual meeting on January 23.</p>
