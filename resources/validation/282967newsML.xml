<p>Race and housing are key issues in Thursday's general election in Singapore after a campaign that featured tough words and a row between the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) and the United States.</p>
<p>The campaign peaked with a war of words between Workers' Party candidate Tang Lian Hong and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, whose PAP is guaranteed a majority with 47 uncontested seats in the 83-member parliament.</p>
<p>Goh accused Tang of threatening racial harmony in Singapore -- nearly 80 percent ethnic Chinese, with minorities of Tamils and Malays -- with views Goh described as &quot;Chinese chauvinism&quot;.</p>
<p>Tang has said he would take legal action against Goh and others in the PAP over their charges, but not until after the election. Goh and PAP leaders say they will sue Tang if he does not apologise ahead of the election for remarks he has made about them.</p>
<p>There were brief racial riots in Singapore in 1965, shortly before the country split from neighbouring Malaysia, and Goh raised the stakes by pitting his personal prestige in the battle to keep Tang out of parliament.</p>
<p>The race row is an extension of the character card being played strongly by the PAP.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't take chances. Vote for an honest, reliable and capable MP,&quot; the party has said in a letter to voters.</p>
<p>Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) leader, Chee Soon Juan, has been targeted by the government as &quot;a proven liar&quot; and being &quot;guilty of deceit&quot;.</p>
<p>Goh got into a row with Washington over his message to voters that they would lose out on subsidised housing renovation schemes if they voted for the opposition.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department criticised him for that and Goh, along with his colleagues, fumed at what they called interference in Singapore affairs.</p>
<p>While Goh has established the main issues, opposition leaders hope that with the PAP already guaranteed power, voters feel bold enough to choose alternative voices in parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;We want the basic freedoms, to have the right to question our government, to have it be accountable to us, to have a say in how our country is run,&quot; Chee said in an interview.</p>
<p>First-time voters in a country where voting is compulsory for all over the age of 21 appear to be responsive to this view, even if they back the PAP.</p>
<p>&quot;For me, I still believe in the PAP. There is more stability and there is already a sense of trust,&quot; said Wixy Song, a 23-year old student.</p>
<p>But, she added: &quot;I still think the opposition is necessary, for only if there is competition would there be improvement.&quot;</p>
<p>Personal well-being and the desire to raise living standards are the main factors driving electors. While working people complain Singapore is an increasingly expensive place to live in, they also say they are better off than 10 years ago.</p>
<p>The SDP says between 1988 and 1993, income rose seven percent while household spending jumped 76 percent, but the parliamentary cost review committee says prices were only 14 percent higher over the period.</p>
<p>The committee said the increase in spending was a result of people buying more expensive luxury items. It also said that household incomes had risen 48 percent over the period.</p>
<p>Public spending on health care, the elderly, pension funds and vehicle taxes are also on the agenda.</p>
<p>In the weeks running up to the election, the government unveiled a Singapore $500 million (US$357 million) Senior Care Fund to pay the running costs of community-based health care services for poor elderly patients.</p>
<p>The Workers' Party is campaigning for a comprehensive public health insurance scheme, in the mould of Britain's National Health Service, and the National Solidarity Party said the state should bear rising health care costs.</p>
