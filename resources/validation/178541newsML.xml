<p>A European troika delegation headed by Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring left Damascus on Sunday after talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on reviving Arab-Israeli peace.</p>
<p>Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara termed the meeting a success and said the EU and Arabs had similar views on how to proceed with peace negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very successful visit and we are happy with the results of the visit...the EU position is identical or very close to the Arab one,&quot; Shara told reporters before the delegation left Damascus.</p>
<p>Presidential spokesman Joubran Kourieh said Shara was at the troika's meeting with Assad in the capital's presidential palace.</p>
<p>The visit by the delegation, which includes envoys from Netherland, Italy and Ireland, was part of a regional tour to advance Middle East peace and discuss the appointment of a proposed EU envoy to the talks.</p>
<p>&quot;They agree that it is important to resume the peace talks from the point which they reached and that it is necessary to honour all the agreements made with the previous Israeli government and the talks should resume on the same principles they were based on,&quot; Shara said.</p>
<p>Spring said his talks with Assad were &quot;very useful&quot; and urged Israel to honour its previous agreements. He said Assad assured him Syria was committed to peace.</p>
<p>Syrian-Israeli peace talks have been suspended since before the May election of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who rejects the principle of returning occupied Arab lands for peace.</p>
