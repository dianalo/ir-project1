<title>USA: Cerplex Group violates debt covenants.</title>
<headline>Cerplex Group violates debt covenants.</headline>
<dateline>TUSTIN, Calif. 1996-10-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Cerplex Group Inc said Thursday it is currently in violation of certain covenants of its senior and subordinated debt agreements and is in talks to amend the loan deals.</p>
<p>It said it has received waivers through November 30 from lenders and added it previously disclosed the violations in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Cerplex also said it's tangible net worth has fallen below the minimum requirements for listing on the Nasdaq National Market, and it is talking with the NASD about the subject. </p>
<p>Earlier, Cerplex reported a $0.96 per share loss for the third quarter ended September 30 versus a loss of $1.91 a share one year ago.</p>
<p>In a statement Cerplex, a provider of service outsourcing, parts and logistics services, said third quarter losses reflect charges for asset write downs, higher interest expense and &quot;a variety of other factors.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;During 1996, we began refocusing our operations on providing services which were less inventory intensive while downsizing or closing unprofitable operations,&quot; said William Klein, chief executive.</p>
<p>Cerplex also said collection problems with one bankrupt client and several other customers caused it to tighten credit standards and revise its target customer profile.</p>
<p>&quot;Operational issues based on our former business model and other factors have impacted, and will in the near term continue to impact, our financial condition and results of operations,&quot; Klein said.</p>
<p>However, he noted in the last quarter the company has put its our new Ontario, Calif., hub on line. At that facility, Hewlett-Packard is the company's anchor customer. Cerplex also has begun operations at a new Louisville, Ky., hub.</p>
<p>It signed a work agreement with Digital Equipment Corp and is negotiating several other agreements with high quality customers that could provide over $25 million in business in fiscal 1997.</p>
