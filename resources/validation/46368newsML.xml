<p>Armed motorcyclists freed two prisoners in Cyprus from a police car on Wednesday by cutting off their handcuffs with clippers before fleeing through a U.N. checkpoint to the Turkish-held part of the island.</p>
<p>A police spokesman said Abi Biton, 21, and Shuki Samana, 24 -- both Israeli nationals from Haifa -- escaped with their two accomplices after a police car taking them to court on charges of handling forged bills was intercepted in central Nicosia.</p>
<p>Cyprus police identified the accomplices as Israelis Amor Shimon, 28, and David Biton, 24.</p>
<p>Eray Merturk, police chief of the Turkish-held sector of Nicosia, said all four surrendered and authorities were in contact with the Israeli embassy.</p>
<p>A Turkish Cypriot court ordered the two men be held in custody for three days, Turkish Cypriot police sources said. A Turkish Cypriot news agency said the order would give police a chance to investigate.</p>
<p>&quot;Two armed motorcyclists intercepted the police car, cut the suspects handcuffs off with clippers and put them on the back of their bikes,&quot; Cypriot police spokesman Stelios Neofytou said.</p>
<p>&quot;They left the bikes at the checkpoint and ran into the occupied areas,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The northern part of the island has been inaccessible to Cyprus police since Turkey invaded in 1974 in the wake of a brief coup engineered by the military regime ruling Greece at the time.</p>
<p>Abi Biton and Samana were being taken to court in the coastal town of Larnaca from Nicosia's central prison where they were to stand trial on charges of possessing $7,000 in counterfeit bills. The two were arrested on August 30.</p>
<p>Before speeding off, the motorcyclists cut the radio in the police car and took the car keys, leaving the two officers stranded. The motorcycles were rented from Larnaca.</p>
<p>Later both policemen were put on suspension pending a disciplinary inquiry, police said.</p>
<p>Two British U.N. soldiers at the Ledra Palace checkpoint tried to stop the four by closing a gate leading to the other side. All four climbed over the gate, ringed with barbed wire, and threatened the peacekeepers with a knife, a U.N. spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.N. has launched a request for their return... they stormed a U.N. obstacle and threatened U.N. personnel,&quot; spokesman Waldemar Rokosewski said.</p>
<p>Turkish Cypriot police sources said the four had asked to be sent to Turkey or Israel.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses told Reuters the four -- two of them with the remains of the handcuffs dangling from their wrists -- walked over to the Turkish Cypriot checkpoint, saying they were tourists who wanted to visit the Turkish-held north.</p>
<p>&quot;They were not mickey mouse guys. The whole thing looked very professional,&quot; said another U.N. source.</p>
