<p>Cuban Ivan Pedroso put his worries behind him by setting the second best indoor long jump performance ever with an effort at 8,60 metres in an international meeting on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pedroso, who struggled last year after undergoing surgery on his right thigh in March, proved he was back at his brilliant best by becoming the second indoor performer behind Carl Lewis, who set the world record in 8.79 metres in 1984.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew I was fit but I'm surprised, I didn't expect to do so well,&quot; said Pedroso after boosting his confidence ahead of next month's indoor world championships in Paris, where he will defend his title.</p>
<p>The Cuban has often been unlucky in the past few years, setting a would-be outdoor world record in 8.96 metres in 1995 in Sestriere, Italy. Allegations were made of interference by an official standing in front of the wind gauge and the record was not recognised.</p>
<p>Last year, he struggled to recapture his best form after his operation and ended a disappointing 12th in the Olympics in Atlanta.</p>
<p>High hurdles Olympic champion Allen Johnson narrowly beat Briton Colin Jackson in a 60 metres hurdles in one of the other highlights of Sunday's meeting.</p>
<p>American Johnson and Jackson, warming up for their duel in Paris, both thought they had won after crossing the line.</p>
<p>Johnson was declared the winner in 7.53 seconds with Jackson second in the same time as his rival.</p>
<p>Jackson, gradually recapturing his best form after a disappointing season last year, had set a world class time of 7.46 last month in Suttgart and was looking forward to beating Johnson.</p>
<p>But the American said he would not be happy with anything else but first places this season.</p>
<p>&quot;I want my opponents to realise that when they're running against me, they're fighting for second place,&quot; said Johnson, adding he would go for Jackson's 110 metres hurdles world record of 12.91 seconds this year.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's possible for me to run in 12.78, maybe even less,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Indoor specialist Irina Privalova of Russia warned she would be one to watch in Paris by setting the year's best times in both events she entered, 7.02 seconds in the 60 metres and 22.52 in the 200 metres.</p>
<p>&quot;I really like it here, the track is fast,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm pleased with my times and I'm looking forward to being in Paris for the world championships.&quot;</p>
