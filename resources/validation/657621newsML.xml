<p>CBOT soy complex and grain futures Thursday were expected to be torn by perceptions of bearish ammo from a USDA supply/demand report against bullish fuel from weekly export data, analysts and traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Soybeans will be significant this morning. They (USDA) increased imports by 10 million bushels, but unless we see another major commercial import more beans I don't think we're out of the woods,&quot; said Jerry Gidel, Senior Grain analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>Gidel and Anthony P. Danielak, Vice President for Harris Futures Inc appeared early Thursday at a CBOT press conference following the 0730 CDT release of the government's June supply/demand report and weekly export sales report.</p>
<p>Calls for the futures markets were variable with the USDA supply/demand data viewed bearish and the export sales report bullish.</p>
<p>Soybeans were called to open three to five cents lower, corn one to two cents lower and wheat two to four cents lower. But some opined the export numbers would override the government S/D data and futures would open higher.  </p>
<p>&quot;They increased old crop carryover (soybeans) but in beans the drop in new crop (carryout) is pretty significant this early and when you look at exports that is very impressive for new crop sales,&quot; Danielak said.</p>
<p>USDA Thursday boosted to 130 million bushels its estimate for 1996-97 U.S. soybean carryout from the previous 125 million bushels, but put 1997-98 U.S. soybean carryout at 240 million bushels. The 240 million bushel tally is a low level for soybean carryout estimates this early in the season, the analysts said.</p>
<p>The analysts took note of new crop soybean export sales.  </p>
<p>USDA said Thursday U.S. net export sales of soybeans for the 1997-98 marketing year, which begins on Sept 1, totaled 572,400 tonnes, above expectations for 200,000 to 400,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll be higher on the export sales,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The market also took note of USDA's increase in its estimate for 1997 U.S. winter wheat production to 1.604 billion bushels, above the government's estimate in May for 1.561 billion.</p>
<p>But, as in the soybean complex, wheat export data will mute the bearish effect of the wheat production tally.  </p>
<p>USDA's weekly export sales report Thursday pegged net export sales of wheat for 1997-98 at 562,500 tonnes, above expectations for 200,000 to 450,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Also, the CBOT panel pointed out the U.S. winter wheat crop is just now beginning to be harvested and there are significant weather problems which could scrub the government's wheat production estimate.</p>
<p>&quot;The wheat market is focused on quality and the volume of the crop in the Plains,&quot; Gidel said. Persistent rainfall in the harvest areas could trim yields and volume of the hard red winter crop, Gidel said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The longer we have rain down there the more quality concerns,&quot; Gidel said, referring to the showers currently underway in the Southern Plains harvest region.</p>
<p>USDA Thursday trimmed to 460 million bushels its estimate for 1996-97 U.S. wheat carryout from the previous 465 million bushels, a move expected to be only mildly supportive to wheat prices.</p>
<p>USDA left unchanged at 909 million bushels its projection for 1996-97 U.S. corn carryout.</p>
<p>But U.S. net export sales of corn for the 1996-97 marketing year at 626,200 tonnes were above expectations for 300,000 to 500,000 tonnes. Also USDA pegged net export sales of 1997-98 U.S. corn during the week ended June 5 at 474,900 tonnes, above expectations for 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes.</p>
