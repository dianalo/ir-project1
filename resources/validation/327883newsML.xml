<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Thursday that he expected President Boris Yeltsin, who is recovering from pneumonia in his country home, to return to work in the next few days, Itar-Tass news agency said.</p>
<p>Tass quoted Chernomyrdin as telling a meeting of senior ministers he was sure Yeltsin would &quot;resume his duties in full in the next few days.&quot;</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin said he had met Yeltsin on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The president went to the Kremlin briefly on Wednesday, two days after he was released from hospital, his press office said. But no pictures have been released of Yeltsin since he fell ill.</p>
<p>A spokesman said on Thursday that Yeltsin was working on documents in his Gorky-9 residence and no meetings were planned.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's personal doctor Sergei Mironov said on television on Wednesday that recovery from pneumonia normally took between two and three weeks and doctors were advising Yeltsin not to try to rush the recovery process.</p>
