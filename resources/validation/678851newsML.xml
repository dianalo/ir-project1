<headline>Australian Grain-El Nino sceptics gather strength.</headline>

<p>The threat of an El Nino drought was virtually written off by the grains trade in Australia by the end of last week, despite a big cut in forecast new wheat production by the government's official commodities analyst.</p>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) on Tuesday reversed its prediction just two weeks earlier of a 19.2 million tonne 1997/98 crop to one of just 16.2 million tonnes, based on the prospect of El Nino drought.  </p>
<p>Sydney Futures Exchange wheat contracts responded perversely by falling on Tuesday and continuing to fall throughout the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Cash prices for 1997/98 crop wheat were also unimpressed by the ABARE forecast, holding steady at best.</p>
<p>&quot;Every time they start talking about the El Nino it starts raining again,&quot; Guy Allen of NSW grains handler and trader GrainCorp said on Friday. &quot;I'm a real sceptic on that El Nino.&quot;</p>
<p>Allen is not alone in this.  </p>
<p>Queensland farm services group Farmarco is among those taking a cautious line on El Nino, disbelieving the ABARE view that yields will be seriously hit.</p>
<p>It does agree that Australia faces dry weather but not full-scale drought.</p>
<p>Another El Nino sceptic on Friday quoted a farmer's opinion about whether Australia's wheat crop was about to be decimated by drought.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll let you know when it dries out enough to let me finish planting,&quot; the industry official quoted the grower as saying.</p>
<p>The Australian Wheat Board is another El Nino sceptic.  </p>
<p>Earlier last week the AWB, unmoved by the ABARE forecast, stood by its unofficial forecast of 18 million tonnes.</p>
<p>In its latest market report, AWB said new crop conditions overall in NSW, Queensland and Western Australia looked good and that reasonable sub-soil moisture levels were in place.</p>
<p>Addressing the International Grain Council's annual conference in London, AWB chairman Trevor Flugge reinforced the AWB's optimistic view on Friday by saying that with growers intending to plant 11 million hectares to wheat, Australia was capable of producing a crop of up to 20 million tonnes.  </p>
<p>Another centrally-placed grains indusdtry executive, who asked not to be named, put the crop closer to 19 million tonnes or 20 million tonnes than ABARE's 16.2 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Allen on Friday pointed out that timely rains had fallen around NSW during the week as harvest of the current crop reached about 95 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;(It's been) a very good start to the season,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Allen expected the market to drop more than it did last week because of Chicago's decline and the European crop's better than expected showing. The weaker Australian dollar was the main bullish factor in the market, he said.  </p>
<p>Cash prices were steady over the week, with new crop about A$164.00 delivered Newcastle. Old crop prices finished the week on A$182.00-A$184.00 a tonne in very light trade.</p>
<p>Sorghum prices fell about A$5.00 a tonne to about A$158.00-A$160.00 on lack of end user demand, he said.</p>
<p>The Australian Wheat Board's multi-grade cash bids for NSW wheat fell by A$3.00 over the week.</p>
<p>SFE wheat futures closed down by about A$5.50 over the week with market leader January 1998 ending on A$168.50 on Friday. Brokers' views were divided on Friday, with broking houses such as Ord Minnett Jardine Fleming and Bell Commodities believing  </p>
<p>the market was ripe for an upturn. The unanswered question was whether it would. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800</p>
