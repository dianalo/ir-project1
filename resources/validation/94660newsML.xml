<p>Trade in exotic currencies will increase with the advent of European economic and monetary union (EMU) but analysts warn the disappearance of common European forex trades will not ensure a shift to emerging markets.</p>
<p>An EMU-led fillip to exotic currency volumes is likely to be relatively small and only a minor boost to the already growing trend to trade markets like the Czech koruna or the Thai baht, foreign exchange experts say.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a shift of resources of traders, salespeople and banking infrastructure to trade these currencies but obviously that cannot run ahead of end-user demand for foreign exchange products,&quot; said Peter von Maydell, senior currency economist at UBS in London.</p>
<p>Investor demand for these markets is growing, with foreign investors and commercial lenders set to put a record of around $225 billion into emerging market economies this year, according to the Institute of International Finance in Washington.</p>
<p>However, many obstacles still remain in turning this growing investor demand into currency market growth.</p>
<p>Liquidity is a major problem. Few of the exotic forex markets approach the depth of the major cross currencies, like the U.S. dollar, the German mark, and Japanese yen.</p>
<p>While traders are focusing on opportunities in the new markets, the positions being taken are tiny compared to what is seen in the major currencies.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, there just isn't the liquidity,&quot; said a corporate dealer at a Swiss bank in London.</p>
<p>&quot;If you try to do a $10 million order in these markets, particularly in central Europe, people do take notice. You must get more participants and then only those that will have a long-term commitment...to make it worth while.&quot;</p>
<p>Liquidity is also hampered by underdeveloped operational and settlement processes as well as greater credit risk. Currency analysts say only those who have invested in building up local expertise will be able to negotiate the fundamental problems individual to each country.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to look at the opportunity and what it is expected to return,&quot; said Nigel Whittaker, head of local currency, fixed income at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London.</p>
<p>&quot;Then you have to work out how much it will cost to investigate the accounting, tax treatment, custody and credit process, and then you look at the bid offer spreads.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Suddenly this great rosy idea doesn't look so good in cold light of day.&quot;</p>
<p>Liquidity constraints are also partly a by-product of restrictive exchange controls adopted by most emerging market central banks.</p>
<p>James Montier, Latin American economist at Kleinwort Benson in London, does see opportunities in these markets but is cautious about the present trading environment.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of these countries operate some form of capital control like fixed or pegged exchange rates, restrictions on shorting money or taxes on transactions, which could dampen some enthusiasm of the foreign exchange market.&quot;</p>
<p>Furthermore, analysts say these controls are in place to fulfill some economic objective by these countries' governments and are not likely to be altered to suit the foreign exchange market's appetite for new, exciting markets.</p>
<p>Whether in place to reduce exchange rate volatility, beat domestic inflation or increase international competitiveness, these currency regimes are likely to be fiercely defended by their respective central banks.</p>
<p>&quot;These central banks are aware of the potential power of the markets if they let the markets get the upper hand,&quot; said Chris Tinker, chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;People will be looking at high-yield plays globally, in Latin America, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, for example. But none of these are markets where central banks will be pleased to see their currencies pushed around by speculative yield players.&quot;</p>
<p>Demand for exotic currencies will largely be driven by trade flows and portfolio flows. Analysts say trade flows are growing rapidly but portfolio flows will also have to increase to ensure higher currency volumes.</p>
<p>&quot;None of the emerging markets has a highly developed capital market,&quot; said UBS' von Maydell.</p>
<p>&quot;Except for a few equity markets here and there, there are no liquid bond markets, no liquid money markets and these currencies are very trade dominated rather than from portfolio flows.&quot;</p>
<p>Central European currencies, particulary the Czech koruna, are now attracting volumes of trade on a par with the relatively more mature Asian currencies.</p>
<p>Analysts say this is due to the proximity of these countries with Europe and the growth of trade flows with Europe as well as the aspirations of some Eastern and Central European countries to joining the European Union.</p>
<p>As a result, trade in the euro against these currencies is expected to grow faster than against other exotic currencies.</p>
<p>When -- or if -- EMU happens, analysts note the process may turn into a non-event as far as foreign exchange is concerned.</p>
<p>The latest forex survey by the Bank for International Settlements estimates that European cross trades only comprise six percent of total currency turnover in London, home of the world's biggest foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>EMU is also coming at a time when the foreign exchange market is tightening its belt as technology advances and trading margins shrink. As a result, banks will be very selective on which currencies can support dealing operations.</p>
<p>&quot;While banks are looking into other markets, dealing rooms are being pared back with only the largest of operations able to survive as market makers,&quot; said the Swiss bank dealer. &quot;With or without EMU, I think it will be &quot;goodbye' to a lot of traders and dealing rooms getting smaller.&quot; -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 6745</p>
