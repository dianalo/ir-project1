<p>Personal incomes rose at the strongest rate in eight months during February, the Commerce Department said on Monday, while spending posted a smaller rise in a fresh sign of the economy's momentum.</p>
<p>Total income from wages, salaries and all other sources jumped 0.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $6.71 trillion -- the biggest gain since a matching 0.9 percent rise last June and more than double the 0.4 percent gain in January.</p>
<p>Spending increased by just 0.3 percent to $5.33 trillion a year following a 1 percent increase in January. It was the smallest rise since a 0.1 percent increase last September as consumers socked more into bank accounts and other savings.</p>
<p>Most analysts said the report, especially the gain in incomes, pointed to continued strong economic growth in the January-March quarter, which was likely to keep Federal Reserve policymakers on edge.</p>
<p>The possibility of higher interest rates weighed heavily on financial markets. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 141 points in morning trading and was off 93 at 6,647 in early afternoon. Bond prices weakened moderately.</p>
<p>The Fed last week boosted short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point, its first increase in more than two years, and cited the risk that strong demand might fire up inflationary wage and price rises.</p>
<p>Costlier credit -- the central bank's primary means of controlling the economy's pace -- eventually tamps down growth by making it more expensive for companies and consumers to borrow.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly there is a lot of momentum,&quot; said Robert Dederick, economic consultant to Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. &quot;Two-thirds of the economy is on a roll, that's the whole household sector.&quot;</p>
<p>Consumer spending on goods and services fuels about two-thirds of national economic activity. It was a major force driving growth at a sturdy 3.8 percent annual rate in last year's final quarter, and analysts now anticipate growth exceeding 3 percent in the quarter just ended.</p>
<p>Dederick said first-quarter expansion almost certainly was &quot;too fast for comfort&quot; from the Fed's viewpoint, since it considers growth around 2 percent to 2.25 percent a year is more likely sustainable without causing destabilizing price rises and wage demands.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost certainly there is more Fed action coming (in the form of higher rates),&quot; Dederick said. &quot;The question is the timing and the degree.&quot;</p>
<p>The central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets next on May 20.</p>
<p>Consumers used some of their extra earnings in February to bolster savings, rather than to spend, as savings climbed to 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned from 5.1 cents in January.</p>
<p>Department officials said it was the highest savings rate in five months, since 5.6 cents out of each dollar earned was put into bank accounts or other forms of savings in September.</p>
<p>Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, cited the slower spending as a sign that there was a greater risk of an abrupt economic slowdown than of accelerating inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;The danger is not inflation, but anemic growth,&quot; Jasinowski said, predicting that consumer spending for all of 1997 was unlikely to exceed real income growth because levels of consumer indebtedness were too high to permit it.</p>
<p>The big jump in February incomes clearly flowed from strong job creation. &quot;Employment, average hourly earnings and average weekly hours all increased in February,&quot; the Commerce Department noted.</p>
<p>There were 339,000 new jobs created in February, the government reported at the beginning of March. The Labor Department is scheduled to release employment figures for March on Friday amid expectations another 182,000 jobs were generated by a rising economic tide.</p>
<p>Separately on Monday, Chicago purchasing managers reported their Chicagoland Business Barometer rose to 57.5 in March from 56.2 in February on a pickup in new orders and production as well as increased hiring.</p>
<p>Economist David Orr of First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C., said there was a good chance that consumer spending would moderate in late spring and summer.</p>
<p>The Fed has &quot;staked themselves out as wanting to curb the demand side of the economy,&quot; Orr noted, and it has the means to do so through more interest-rate rises if needed.</p>
<p>Spending on durable goods, which includes cars, rose 0.1 percent in February to an annual rate of $652.4 billion. Spending on nondurable products grew 0.3 percent from January to a rate of $1.60 trillion while spending for services increased 0.4 percent to $3.09 trillion in February.</p>
