<p>Welfare workers have found a jilted Iranian who has lived as a caveman since his wife left him 30 years ago, a newspaper reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old half-naked man, found in a remote area in the central Isfahan province, had lost most of his his ability to speak but was able to tell welfare workers that he turned to living in a cave after his wife left him, the daily Kayhan said.</p>
<p>Welfare authorities decided to provide the man, known only by his first name Darab, with basic necessities in his cave while they looked for his relatives after he escaped from a clinic and returned to the cave.</p>
