<p>Indian call money rates opened steady at 5.25-5.75 percent and eased to 4.25-4.75 percent in late morning trade on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>The call rates are expected to be in the 5.0-7.0 percent range in the new fortnight despite large outflows on account repo auction and advance tax payment, they said.</p>
<p>At the June 19 repo auction, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised 45.5 billion rupees, a sharp jump from 11.0 billion rupees raised at the June 16 auction.</p>
<p>State-run banks are actively lending in the call market as they are flush with funds and credit offtake has been poor.</p>
<p>An official at the state-run Bank of Baroda said tax outflows have not left the banking system.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks can collect upto June 30,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>RBI's dollar purchases from the inter-bank foreign exchange market has also been adding to domestic liquidity, dealers said.</p>
<p>RBI was active throughout last week, buying dollars at 35.82 level, to arrest the rupee's rise against the U.S. currency.</p>
<p>Security prices were quoted higher in early Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>The RBI is conducting an auction of four day repos on Monday evening.</p>
