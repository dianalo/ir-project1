<p>Hurricane Fran's fierce winds and relentless rain stunned residents of central North Carolina, who said they had expected their inland locale to at most be glanced by the storm that ravaged instead.</p>
<p>But when Hurricane Fran finished raging through the Piedmont overnight on Thursday at 120 mph (193 kph) winds, it had taken lives, destroyed homes, devastated farms, caused widespread power outages and deprived a hospital of water.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the meteorologists anticipated it coming in like this. They were saying by the time it got here there would be diminished winds,&quot; construction worker Henry Benjamin said. &quot;Well about 8 p.m. the rain picked up, and at 12 all hell broke loose.&quot;</p>
<p>The state lost 15 residents to the storm, most in flash floods after nearly 10 inches (25.4 cms) of rain that night.</p>
<p>Residents of the state capital here said they have made it through several other hurricanes and were not too worried by forecasts of Hurricane Fran because of projections that it would follow the path of so many others and hit the coast.</p>
<p>But they now admit that Fran was nothing like the others.</p>
<p>&quot;Fran is a little unusual in that she has been so large and so devastating,&quot; said Sara Kempin, a spokeswoman for the State Emergency Response Team.</p>
<p>David Britt, a state employee who stood ankle-deep in tree debris on the courtyard of his apartment building complex, described neighbours' reactions: &quot;At 4 o'clock Friday morning everybody was walking around stunned. We just didn't expect nothing more than a lot of heavy rain because Raleigh is about two hours from the beach.&quot;</p>
<p>The storm cut a swath from the southeastern end of the state on Cape Fear, where it came ashore, and continued wreaking havoc northwest through the state.</p>
<p>Residents recounted the deadly hurricane throughout the day and into the late night on Saturday as chainsaws cut away uprooted trees and limbs that had snapped utility lines, broken natural gas lines and crushed cars.</p>
<p>At Wilson's Outdoor Equipment, lines for chainsaw parts and other supplies snaked around the corner store. Customers were admitted up to nine at a time -- one for each clerk in the store -- in order to maintain order.</p>
<p>&quot;We started watching Fran on Wednesday and started making moves to get our supply up. We probably sold well in excess of 400 saws since Thursday,&quot; John Sturchiro said.</p>
<p>National Guard soldiers were brought in to provide security, generators, water and help with debris removal. Originally 750 troops were activated but that number has since increased to 1,200, and still more may come.</p>
<p>&quot;We have over 1,200 soldiers and airmen actively committed to mission support and another 350 in reserve for future requirements,&quot; said Maj.-Gen. Gerald Rudisill.</p>
<p>The area was focusing on public health concerns. Residents were urged to stay out of inland waters because of sewage overflows and other hazards.</p>
<p>&quot;In Raleigh, a power outage at a sewage lift station caused the bypass of more than 50 million gallons of untreated sewage,&quot; a public health official said.</p>
<p>Additionally, flood waters may hide downed trees or power lines.</p>
