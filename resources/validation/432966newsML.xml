<p>Mexican authorities on Monday jailed two Jesuit priests on charges of leading a peasant attack in which two policemen were killed in the southern state of Chiapas.</p>
<p>They were arrested on Saturday with two Mayan Indian leaders after a gunbattle near Palenque, the site of famous Mayan ruins. Police said the priests led the attack on Friday.</p>
<p>Washington-based Human Rights Watch said the arrrests were unjustified and the men were held incommunicado for 20 hours.</p>
<p>In a letter to the government of Chiapas, the group said the detainees should be freed immediately because &quot;the only information presented by authorities thus far to justify the arrests falls far short of Mexican legal standards.&quot;</p>
<p>The Catholic Church said the charges were fabricated and part of a campaign to discredit it. Relations between the church and the government have been sour since a Zapatista peasant uprising in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that we're dealing with a political question to drain confidence in...the work of the diocese,&quot; Bishop Raul Vera of San Cristobal de las Casas said after visiting the two Mexican priests, Geronimo Hernandez and Gonzalo Rosas.</p>
<p>The bishop told reporters the priests had been tied and beaten after their arrest in what he described as &quot;an agression against the Catholic Church.&quot;</p>
<p>The trouble started after police dislodged Indian squatters from two farms. The Indians blocked a highway to protest the evictions and they were confronted by police.</p>
<p>Police said they peacefully moved the protestors and were then ambushed by four armed men, including the two priests. The protestors said police fired first and they fired back.</p>
<p>Church officials denied the two priests were even in Palenque at the time, saying they were in San Cristobal de las Casas, having attended a religious conference.</p>
<p>Chiapas Attorney General Jorge Hernandez denied there had been any beatings, and said the two priests were clearly identified by officials as having taken part in the killings.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church in Chiapas has long had a difficult relationship with the government, which accuses it of having links with the Zapatista rebels who launched an uprising for Indian rights in the state in January 1994.</p>
<p>One of the jailed priests, Hernandez, served as an advisor to the Zapatistas in peace talks until they were suspended in March last year. He was also charged with the federal offence of carrying an unlicensed gun.</p>
<p>The Zapatistas have barely fired a shot in anger since the early days of their uprising when some 145 people were killed in less than two weeks of fighting.</p>
