<p>After a hectic year for new British share issues this year, 1997 looks like being no quieter, with a stream of smaller stocks coming to the market as well as three large building societies.</p>
<p>However, brokers said the key factor affecting the number of new issues will be a general election, which must be held by mid-May.</p>
<p>Interest rate levels and the ability of the stock market to avoid volatility will also be factors, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;Next year the election will be the determinant factor and new issues will probably cease altogether around the time of the general election,&quot; said one broker active in new issues.</p>
<p>But even if issues did falter around then, they would pick up again in the second half, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Next year will depend on what happens as a result of the election, whether the new government has a clear majority, what happens with interest rates and how the market settles down after the (recent) market volatility,&quot; said one corporate finance executive with an investment house.</p>
<p>Brokers said new issues had been stimulated in 1996 by the bullish stock market as companies took advantage of relatively high share prices to issue stock. Issuers included companies in the so-called sunrise sectors in biotechnology and electronics.</p>
<p>In 1996, the flow of new issues seemed unstoppable until December when Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments about exuberant stock prices swung markets into reverse and brought British new issues to a halt.</p>
<p>&quot;The new issues market has been pretty good but it has been a bit trickier over the last month or so, particularly for smaller companies,&quot; said another broker.</p>
<p>In the wake of Greenspan's comments and the market turbulence which ensued, three flotations were called off and one new listing in the biotechnology sector was hit badly.</p>
<p>A long-awaited float of gene therapy developer Oxford Biomedica was delayed by two days. When it did come to the market, the share quickly slumped below its issue price.</p>
<p>But markets have stabilised after the Greenspan blip and new issues are set to return.</p>
<p>In addition to three large building societies the Halifax, the Woolwich and the Alliance and Leicester -- traditional mortgage lenders turning themselves into banks -- a variety of smaller companies plan to list next year, with leisure-related companies predominating.</p>
<p>The first new issue of 1997 will be Sanctuary Music, a music production company raising funds to finance expansion. It will float at 65 pence, valuing it at 7.0 million pounds ($11.7 million).</p>
<p>Also in the entertainment field, film equipment hire firm VFG plans to list in January. It will raise 3.0 million pounds and have a market capitalisation of 7.0 million.</p>
<p>One growing stock market presence in the traditional leisure industry is football. Several soccer clubs listed in 1996, including Sunderland in late December. In 1997 West Bromwich Albion, Birmingham City and Newcastle, one of the leading clubs, plan to float.</p>
<p>Telecom-related stocks will also feature in 1997. Interactive Media Services, which provides automated telephone services, plans to float in the first quarter of 1997 with a 45.0 million tag.</p>
<p>In a more unusual sector, nursery school operator Creme de la Creme plans to list on the junior Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in January or February. With a tag of 5.0 million pounds, the company plans to raise 2.0 million for expansion.</p>
<p>The AIM saw a particularly lively year in 1996, its first full year in operation, not least because listing requirements there are more attractive to new companies and can offer a cheaper source of funds than venture capital, brokers said.</p>
<p>London Stock Exchange statistics showed new issues, including listings on the AIM, raised 1.91 billion pounds in the first nine months of 1996 against 1.49 billion in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Most of 1996's new issues were on AIM -- 97 against 34 for the full market.</p>
<p>&quot;AIM is growing with the realisation among smaller firms that it is possible to get on to it without a three-year track record,&quot; said John Hardy, head of corporate finance at broker Durlacher. ($1=.5977 Pound)</p>
