<p>Japanese rescue workers joined German and Egyptian teams on Thursday to search for survivors in the rubble of the collapsed Cairo apartment building in which at least 31 people died.</p>
<p>Many more people are feared buried in the ruins of the 11-storey building, which crumbled into a mountain of dust and concrete slabs on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know if there are still people alive or not,&quot; a grim-faced Ismail Osman, chairman of Arab Contractors in Cairo, told the Japanese as they arrived before dawn at the site in the suburb of Heliopolis.</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Kunio Kazakura told Reuters his country's team would use sound and breathing detectors.</p>
<p>&quot;We will do as much as we can to assist the rescue work,&quot; he said. &quot;We have experience in this kind of thing.&quot;</p>
<p>The Japanese, wearing blue and orange jumpsuits with &quot;Disaster Relief Team&quot; sewn on the backs, were briefed in a nearby office on the rescue operations so far at the collapsed apartment block, which Egyptian newspapers have called the &quot;building of death.&quot;</p>
<p>Some of the Japanese leaned out of the office window with cameras to take pictures of the devastated site before joining the other rescuers swarming over the hill of rubble.</p>
<p>Under the glare of floodlights, exhausted workers combed the rubble with pick-axes and their hands, pulling out children's clothing, flattened toys, torn mattresses and other debris of people's lives.</p>
<p>The Japanese International Cooperation Agency has sent a 24-strong team to join the German Red Cross and Egyptian workers.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the teams began searching a corner of the building which did not fully crumble.</p>
<p>&quot;These are spots where we can find people living,&quot; said Assad Salama, who was sent by London's Imperial College to help in the rescue operations.</p>
<p>German workers and sniffer dogs began the delicate task of examining the unstable corner. A crane lifted them up in a swaying basket so they could peer into crevices with torches. At one point an avalanche of rubble came pouring down, sending officials and journalists running for cover.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; German Red Cross worker Freider Shafer told Reuters after the search. &quot;Only places, holes where we can search for people. There might be people inside.&quot;</p>
<p>Bulldozers scooped up debris as weary relatives looked on, covering their mouths and noses from the dust and stench of decomposing corpses.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, rescuers pulled out two women alive but they said the chances of finding more survivors were receding.</p>
<p>Authorities said the building had been illegally heightened. Officials have promised tougher punishments for unlicensed buildings and parliament is expected to discuss drafting a law banning people from renovating flats without expert permission.</p>
<p>Soaring property prices have encouraged landlords to add extra floors illegally. Several buildings have collapsed beneath the extra weight and recent earthquakes have also taken their toll on poorly constructed buildings in the crowded Egyptian capital.</p>
