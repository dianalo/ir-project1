<p>Tamil Tiger separatists attacked a police checkpoint in Sri Lanka's eastern Trincomalee district on Friday, killing two policemen and some civilians, military officials in the east said.</p>
<p>They said Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) attacked the Thoppur bridge checkpoint in Muttur in Trincomalee early on Friday, but no details on the attack or the number civilians killed were immediately available.</p>
<p>A Defence Ministry spokesman in Colombo said he did not have information about the attack.</p>
<p>The LTTE, who are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east, have stepped up attacks in the eastern parts of the island in past weeks.</p>
<p>Police have blamed the LTTE for a grenade attack last week in which a Tamil parliamentary deputy and three others were killed.</p>
<p>Military officials have accused the rebels of kidnapping 41 people, most of them Moslems, from the coastal Erakkandi village near Trincomalee earlier this month.</p>
<p>They said the men were abducted because the rebels suspected they had disclosed information to the military about some separatists who had escaped when the Sri Lankan navy engaged them in a battle in the seas off Trincomalee.</p>
<p>A Defence Ministry statement meanwhile said on Friday that eight rebels were killed on Wednesday when the guerrillas attacked a route-clearing patrol in northeastern Nedunkerni, which the army captured in the early days of &quot;Operation Jayasikuru&quot;, or &quot;Sure of Victory&quot;.</p>
<p>Some 20,000 troops launched the operation in May to open a strategic highway linking northern Jaffna peninsula with the rest of the island.</p>
<p>But the offensive slowed after early gains for the military when the rebels mounted two fierce counterattacks last month. Scores of rebels and soldiers were killed in the attack.</p>
<p>Deputy Defence Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte told parliament on Thursday that 19 officers and 359 soldiers have been killed in the offensive since it started. Seventy-six officers and 1,674 soldiers have been wounded.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war, now in its 14th year. The LTTE say the toll is higher.</p>
