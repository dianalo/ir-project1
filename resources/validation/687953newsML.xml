<p>Suzie Wong has straightened out her life and is studying for a business degree.</p>
<p>As capitalist Hong Kong prepares for a new dawn under communist China, she is being consigned to history along with the rickshaw, the pigtailed coolie and the opium den.</p>
<p>The little harbour hotel where she plied her trade with American sailors has been replaced by a marble skyscraper and the waterfront has retreated under force of reclamation.</p>
<p>Suzie's place in the girlie bars of Hong Kong's Wanchai district has been taken by Mimi from Manila, a surly 20-year-old, and Doi from Bangkok, who is worried about the immigration police. &quot;No money, no talk!&quot; the bargirl's cry immortalised in Richard Mason's 1950s classic, &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot;, has become a more threatening, and far more desperate: &quot;You buy me one more ladies' drink!&quot;</p>
<p>Suzie would be 60 if she was still around today. A few relics from her era in the brothel-bar of the Luk Kwok Hotel survive in the trade as hard-bitten mama-sans.</p>
<p>They crouch on low stools outside neon-lit entrances to clubs with names like Superstar and Waikiki, springing up to tug at the sleeves of passing tourists and businessmen, who have replaced sailors as the area's best customers.</p>
<p>&quot;Ai Ya!&quot; exclaimed the 40-something topless barmaid in the Crazy Horse, the one Chinese face among a dozen or so Filipinas working behind the bar and dancing in leotards on stage.</p>
<p>&quot;Hong Kong girls don't like to do this work. They like to go to college and study business.&quot;</p>
<p>The truth is that Wanchai's sex-for-sale bars are now grim, half-empty shelters for lonely expatriates and the odd sailor on a shore pass. And they're expensive, too.</p>
<p>These days it would cost Robert Lomax, the English hero of &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot;, US$500 or more to pay Suzie's &quot;take-out&quot; fee and escort her to a hotel room for an hour or so of &quot;jig-a-jig&quot;.</p>
<p>A couple of beers and enough ladies' drinks to keep the peace could easily set him back $100.</p>
<p>Budget brothels are now clustered together across Victoria Harbour in seedy tenements that line Temple Street in Mongkok.</p>
<p>Here Mrs Wang, a recent immigrant from Beijing, delivers a bruising massage and -- for those too battered, or too drunk, to resist -- a furtive &quot;special&quot; on a padded bench in the Everlasting Virtue Sauna Palace.</p>
<p>Mrs Wang is a former factory hand, hates communism and its regulated drudgery and is proud to announce that in her new line of work among the whorehouses of Kowloon &quot;I can earn more in one month than in one year in Beijing&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nowhere in the world like Hong Kong,&quot; she enthuses.</p>
<p>Many of the Mongkok prostitutes have been smugled in from China by &quot;snakeheads&quot;, the Triad gang-controlled smugglers who shuttle girls and contraband by speedboat into quiet bays in the remote New Territories.</p>
<p>Prices of these mainland hookers are openly displayed on yellow neon signs, ranked in order of age, skin tone and beauty. A 15-year-old peasant girl from Shenzhen costs just $90.</p>
<p>While Suzie Wong's life had a happy ending -- a fresh start with Lomax in Japan -- the illegal immigrants are often snared in police raids and bussed home across the border.</p>
<p>Back in Wanchai, the Luk Kwok hotel has long been demolished. A glittering glass-and-marble replacement now bears its name, but Suzie would never have got past the security guards hovering by the high-speed elevators.</p>
<p>The old Star Ferry, where Lomax first spotted Suzie in pigtails splitting melon seeds with her teeth, still plies the harbour, although its berth in Wanchai is now on reclaimed land far from the bars.</p>
<p>Double-decker trams still clang through the district.</p>
<p>But the rickshaw pullers who once padded barefoot along Lockhart Road have given way to red Toyota taxis, yellow minibuses and, below ground, the Mass Transit Railway.</p>
<p>&quot;Like every other business in Hong Kong -- and this is undoubtedly one of the biggest -- the sex industry caters for every pocket,&quot; writes Kate Whitehead in her new book, &quot;After Suzie&quot;, co-authored with Nurie Vittachi.</p>
<p>&quot;And it's tax free.&quot;</p>
