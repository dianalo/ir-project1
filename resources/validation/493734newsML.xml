<p>ING Barings on Tuesday warned investors against buying on the stock market in Thailand as it was vulnerable to macroeconomic and political factors.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors should continue to underweight the SET (Stock Exchange of Thailand) as Thailand's stock market will largely be dictated by macroeconomic factors and political developments, none of which are conducive to buying now,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;We recommend even long-term investors to delay their decisions to accumulate till third quarter 1997 when more facts will be available,&quot; the firm said in a statement.</p>
<p>By the third quarter, banks would have disclosed information on non-performing loans and listed companies their second quarter results, while rating agencies, like Moody's, will also have had their say, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;ING Barings does not expect Thailand's economy to stage a sustainable turnaround till the first half of 1998,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It said a recovery depended on whether the government manages to trim domestic interest rates to stir the economy.</p>
