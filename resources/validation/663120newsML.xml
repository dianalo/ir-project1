<p>Belgium's Tractebel S.A. won a repeat tender on Monday for the right to manage Kazakhstan's natural gas pipeline network for 15 years in a deal worth $630 million, the government said.</p>
<p>The deal sees the company increase its presence in the republic, having bought several power stations around the Kazakh capital Almaty for $250 million last year. It has pledged to invest a further $340 million over the next decade.</p>
<p>Tractebel already supplies heat and electricity to Almaty.</p>
<p>&quot;The negotiations have been long and hard,&quot; Tractebel's senior vice president, Nicolas Atherinos, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Argentinian independent Bridas Energy Corp had at one time been announced winner of the troubled tender. A consortium comprising Enron Corp of the United States and Gaz de France also competed for the tender.</p>
<p>Foreign companies lining up for the spoils of a fire-sale of state enterprises, unprecedented for a former Soviet republic, often complain that a deal is not always a deal in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Undeterred, Tractebel have taken on two gas delivery networks in the west and south of the country comprising 9,000 km (6,000 miles) of pipelines which will carry about 65 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas annually.</p>
<p>The company will invest about $600 million in the network and will pay the Kazakh government, anxious for cash to tackle unpaid wages and pensions, a $30 million bonus.</p>
<p>Tractebel, at the insistence of the Kazakh government, has taken on the unattractive southern network, Alaugaz, which delivers fuel to clients in the Almaty region.</p>
<p>The company has promised to build a $100 million pipeline to import gas from Uzbekistan and to replace existing pipelines through neighbouring Kyrgyzstan, an energy hungry republic which has siphoned off gas on its way to Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>But by taking on Alaugaz Tractebel has ensured its grip on the western Batystransgaz network -- the most profitable, as it carries around 60 bcm of Turkmen gas annually on its way to Russia and markets in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;The networks are not only delivering gas in Kazakhstan but are a pivotal point, a crossroads for Central Asia,&quot; Atherinos said.</p>
<p>Turkmenistan's deliveries of gas to Ukraine have been under a cloud in recent months over the latter's large debts. Turkmenistan is looking in the long term to re-route its gas exports south via Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey.</p>
<p>&quot;We remain reasonably optimistic on the renewal of an agreement (on gas supplies) between Turkmenistan and Ukraine,&quot; Atherinos said.</p>
<p>The Kazakh government is clearly hoping that Tractebel will extend the existing pipeline network. One proposed route takes gas to neighbouring China while another would transport gas from the west of the country to the planned new capital Akmola, which suffers from a serious lack of infrastructure.</p>
<p>Tractebel will also have to keep in mind that once major oil fields in western Kazakhstan being developed by foreign companies come on stream, land-locked Kazakhstan will have huge volumes of gas and few means to send it anywhere.</p>
<p>Dyusenbai Duysenov, Kazakhstan's deputy prime minister in charge of industry, eyed the gas as a potential source of cheap fuel for the republic's energy-starved metallurgical plants.</p>
<p>&quot;Our metallurgy industry requires huge amounts of gas,&quot; he told the news conference. &quot;We are in talks with Siemens on constructing gas-turbine power stations,&quot; he told the news conference.</p>
