<p>The Security Council censured Iraq on Monday for refusing to allow more than 100 missile engines to be taken abroad for examination by experts, and reminded Baghdad of its obligation to comply with Gulf War disarmament resolutions.</p>
<p>Council President Paolo Fulci of Italy read out a statement at a formal council meeting saying the council &quot;deplores the refusal by Iraq to allow the special commission to remove approximately 130 missile engines from Iraq for analysis by a team of international experts under the special commission.&quot;</p>
<p>The statement was a follow-up to an oral report earlier this month by chief U.N. weapons inspector Rolf Ekeus that he had again been unable to secure permission to remove Scud missile engines and other components which Iraq destroyed and buried without U.N. supervision soon after the 1991 Gulf war.</p>
<p>The U.N. special commission (UNSCOM) in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction weapons had first tried to remove the unearthed missile parts in November to obtain a definitive accounting of any remaining stocks.</p>
<p>This would be done by comparing identifying numbers on the engines with documents showing the export of missiles by the then-Soviet Union and data confirming their import by Iraq.</p>
<p>Calling for a full accounting of Iraq's missiles with a range greater than 95 miles (150 km), the council reminded Iraq of &quot;its obligation to comply with the provisions of the relevant resolutions and the need to cooperate fully with the special commission.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In this perspective, the council affirms that Iraq is required to allow the special commission to remove the missile engines from its territory,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>When Ekeus reported to the council on Dec. 18 he said he believed Iraq still had &quot;a significant number of operational missiles which could constitute a complete missile force,&quot; but gave no specific number.</p>
<p>He said the question of removing missile engines would again be dealt with when he next met Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz in February.</p>
<p>The Security Council issued its statement the day before it was due to conduct a 60-day review of sanctions imposed on Iraq since its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions are certain to remain unchanged, as they have been since they were first enacted.</p>
<p>A prime condition for an easing of the sanctions is a report to the council by the special commission that Iraq has fulfilled all obligations calling for the scrapping of its nuclear, chemical, biological and ballistic missile potential.</p>
<p>Monday's council statement has no effect on an &quot;oil-for-food&quot; deal that went into force earlier this month permitting Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies to help offset the effects of sanctions on Iraqi civilians.</p>
<p>Ambassador Edward Gnehm of the United States told reporters later he was pleased the council demonstrated its unanimity by issuing the statement on &quot;continuing efforts by Iraq to obstruct UNSCOM and its activities.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Ekeus's report that Iraq was maintaining an operational missile capability was &quot;an extremely serious concern.&quot;</p>
<p>Iraq was continuing to try to &quot;obstruct, through manipulation and deception, the activities of UNSCOM,&quot; and the United States, with its allies, would do everything possible to support Ekeus, Gnehm added.</p>
