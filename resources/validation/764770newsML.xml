<title>IRAN: Tehran municipal officials accused of corruption.</title>

<p>Iranian police have arrested four senior officials of the Tehran municipality for alleged financial corruption, Iranian newspapers reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The English-language Iran News and Iran Daily said among those arrested were Tehran municipality's financial and administrative director, its security chief and the mayor of a Tehran suburb.</p>
<p>They did not say who the fourth official was.</p>
<p>&quot;Those arrested face accusations of financial corruption in connection with their duties,&quot; Iran News said.</p>
<p>Iran Daily said the arrests followed recent calls by senior clerics and supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declaring &quot;war on financial corruption and illegally acquired fortunes&quot;.</p>
<p>Iranian leaders have called for tough action against corruption following a series of trials for embezzlement and fraud at state agencies and banks in recent years.</p>
<p>Khamenei earlier this month called for stepping up the fight against corruption in Iran and rejected suggestions that tough action might discourage investors.</p>
<p>One of Iran's leading clerics, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, on Friday called for swift trials for people who had amassed legendary wealth overnight. He said conventional court procedures took too long.</p>
<p>The anti-corruption drive has taken a political turn with hardline and conservative Islamic newspapers and parliament deputies calling for investigations into moderate officials close to outgoing President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and President-elect Mohammad Khatami, who takes over on August 3.</p>
<p>Iran News said Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi was a supporter of Khatami and had been accused of mismanagement by hardline conservatives defeated in the elections.</p>
