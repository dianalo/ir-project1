<title>BELGIUM: Belgium freezes missile sale to Turkey.</title>

<p>Belgium has frozen plans to sell surface-to-air missiles to Turkey, partly due to increased tension over Cyprus, the defence ministry said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that the problem will be reviewed,&quot; said defence ministry spokesman Colonel Ronny Vandenbroele, who had earlier confirmed reports that French defence company Thomson-CSF was negotiating the sale to Turkey of surplus Belgian and Dutch missile systems.</p>
<p>&quot;There are two new important elements, first the current situation in Cyprus and on the other hand that the Netherlands announced it was abandoning the project. That's why (Defence) Minister Poncelet decided to fully re-examine the case...,&quot; he told BRTN radio.</p>
<p>The Dutch defence ministry said earlier on Tuesday it had no plans to sell missiles to Turkey and added that media reports to that effect were incorrect.</p>
<p>Talks on the sale coincided with renewed tension between Turkey and Greece over the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus where the Greek Cypriot government in the southern half plans to deploy S-300 anti-aircraft missiles bought from Russia.</p>
<p>Vandenbroele noted that talks on the sale had started under the previous government. &quot;This is the result of something that has been going on for two years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Thomson-CSF was seeking to acquire the missiles from Belgium and the Netherlands before selling them on to Turkey and the Belgian Defence Ministry was not in direct talks with Turkey, Vandenbroele said on Monday.</p>
<p>Belgium wanted to sell the U.S. Raytheon-made HAWK missile systems as part of major cutbacks to its armed forces and a freeze on new defence spending.</p>
<p>But as well as requiring domestic approval, any sale would also have to be cleared by the U.S.</p>
<p>Belgium has previously sold other surplus defence equipment through commercial intermediaries. In 1995 Belgian defence firm Sabca refitted and sold to Chile 20 Mirage jet fighters it bought from the air force.</p>
