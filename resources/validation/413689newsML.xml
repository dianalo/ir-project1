<headline>Italy calls for EU to discuss Albanian crisis.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-03-02</dateline>

<p>Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said on Sunday he had called for a European Union meeting to discuss Albania, where a state of emergency has been declared.</p>
<p>Dini said he had asked the Dutch, who hold the rotating EU presidency, to arrange a meeting at the level of foreign ministry political directors to assess the situation either &quot;tomorrow or at the latest the day after&quot;.</p>
<p>The former Italian prime minister told reporters on the margins of an exhibition in northern Italy that he was attending that he also wanted international financial organisations and the United States to take action.</p>
<p>&quot;A financial rescue plan has to be drawn up as soon as possible, then political action is needed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;On the latter level, we must appeal to all the forces present in Albania, both the government and the opposition, to unite, open a dialogue and respect democratic principles.&quot;</p>
<p>The Albanian opposition called on Sunday for an urgent meeting with President Sali Berisha to find ways to end the crisis after armed rioters went on a rampage in the Adriatic town of Sarande, looting shops and torching buildings.</p>
<p>Berisha removed the right-wing government of Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi on Saturday.</p>
<p>The wave of unrest has been triggered by the collapse of risky, high-yield pyramid investment schemes that deprived some Albanians of their savings.</p>
<p>The European Union has recommended that the Albanian authorities quickly call in international experts to help them identify measures to clean up the financial sector.</p>
<p>Italy, within sight of Albania across the Adriatic, is particularly concerned about the situation because it fears a new wave of illegal immigrants from the country.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that the acts of violence and the rebellion that we have seen do not cause further migratory waves,&quot; said Dini. &quot;We must stay alert because we cannot accept illegal flows.&quot;</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry in Rome warned Italians not to visit Albania unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Catholic Caritas charity in the southern port of Brindisi called on the government and local authorities to prepare for the possible arrival of immigrants fleeing the violence in Albania.</p>
