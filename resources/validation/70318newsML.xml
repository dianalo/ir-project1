<p>New Zealand production statistics for the June quarter present a mixed picture, Statistics New Zealand said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>While the quarter saw falls in production of cigarettes and tobacco, beer, footwear, petrol refining and livestock slaughtering, there were significant rises in coal sales, softdrink, and gas and crude petroleum production.</p>
<p>Marginal rises were also seen in electricity production and sawn timber.</p>
<p>The volume of cigarettes available for consumption in the quarter fell 6.6 percent when compared to the year-ago quarter, while tobacco was 23.6 percent lower.</p>
<p>Beer production was 3.3 percent lower than a year ago, while footwear production was down 11.3 percent.</p>
<p>Total petrol production in the June quarter was 8.9 percent less than a year ago. Production of regular petrol rose by 9.2 percent, but this was offset by a decline in premium petrol production of 32 percent.</p>
<p>There were 10.4 percent fewer livestock slaughtered in the June 1996 quarter than in the June 1995 quarter.</p>
<p>Coal sales were up nine percent compared to a year ago.</p>
