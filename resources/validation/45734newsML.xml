<p>Mediterranean oil products were firmer on Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>Gasoline was firmer with futures and the market was broadly in balance. Avails were seen out of Italy and southern France in the second half of the month, even though some barrels earlier offered on the cargo market were thought to have been placed in the internal market.</p>
<p>Naphtha was firmer too, although more barrels were seen emerging with the award expected tomorrow of a tendered Alexandria third decade cargo, as well as of a similarly timed Ras Lanuf piece. Skikda and Greek supplies were still on offer.  </p>
<p>Gas oil was strong. At least four parties were looking for cargoes of low sulphur. Premiums on 0.05 percent were assessed at Oct IPE +$19, cif Genoa.</p>
<p>Traders said the U.S./Europe arbitrage window had enticed at least three low sulphur cargoes across the Atlantic into the Mediterranean -- due to be delivered into Spain, Syria and Italy second half September and first decade October.</p>
<p>But they said the amount of transatlantic material would be limited by the fact few U.S. refiners produce the correct specification for Europe.  </p>
<p>A French refiner was long in Algerian material but traders said it would probably go into its own system.</p>
<p>The fuel oil market was firmer, taking support from the bullish energy complex. The Turkish tender to buy 50kt of low sulphur fuel was won by a trader at mean fob +$9.50-10 cif Izmit for Oct 1-5 dates. Some dealers thought the material would be sourced from outside Europe, but there was no confirmation. The main Med buyer was seen quiet today after activity earlier in the week and before the weekend.</p>
<p>Offers were understood to have been made around $120 cif Italy. An NWE high viscosity cargo went for $120 cif U.K.</p>
