<p>CSCE world sugar futures closed higher after the benchmark October contract failed to erode support and attracted short-covering and fund buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>The front month eased to the recent low of 11.55 cents amid aggressive origin pricing. Short-covering by the trade blocked further losses and brought in speculative buying in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone got a bit too short, the selling dried up and the specs took it higher,&quot; a sugar broker said.</p>
<p>The October contract is seen trading in a range from the contract high of 11.78 to 11.55 cents a lb in the near term, but Friday's Commitment of Traders report could give traders an incentive to break out of that range.</p>
<p>The market expects the report to reveal that the speculators are holding a more than 50 percent net long position.</p>
<p>&quot;It would shake a lot of nerves if the net long position is smaller,&quot; the broker said.</p>
<p>The next downside target was pegged at 11.40-11.20 cents basis October.</p>
<p>The October contract closed 0.10 cent higher at 11.68 cents a lb, having ranged from 11.70 to 11.55 cents. The outer months settled 0.02 to 0.10 cent higher.</p>
<p>An estimated 15,494 lots changed hands on the day compared with Wednesday's official 19,510 lots.</p>
<p>Open interest in October fell by 704 lots to 112,280 lots as of early Wednesday.</p>
