<p>German drugs group Schering AG on Monday said it will still reach its 530 million mark ($352.6 million) 1996 sales target with multiple-sclerosis drug Betaferon despite competing drugs in the U.S. and a difficult product launch in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;We stick by our sales target of 535 million marks for 1996 and expect we can catch up now that France has agreed the pricing issue,&quot; Schering chief financial officer Klaus Pohle told a news conference.</p>
<p>During the first nine months of the year Betaferon sales jumped 36 percent to 395 million marks. The increase is below earlier expectations dashed when problems began cropping up with insurance companies in the U.K.</p>
<p>Schering reduced its sales prediction of 600 million marks for the whole year when U.K. insurance companies declined to free up funds to pay for the expensive treatment.</p>
<p>In France Schering encountered problems with pricings.</p>
<p>&quot;We had forecast 65 million marks worth of sales in the U.K. and we will have had one million marks of sales this year,&quot; Pohle said, explaining why Schering cut its initial forecast and why it was very careful about making very specific predictions for the future.</p>
<p>The group still looks for strong growth in the coming year.</p>
<p>Apart from problems in the U.K. and France however, Schering chief executive Giuseppe Vita said sales in Spain, Italy and Germany were progressing well, leaving the company mostly satisfied with developments.</p>
<p>In the United States, where the drug is sold under the name Betaseron and had no direct competition for several years, Schering said it has felt the impact of newly launched rival drugs.</p>
<p>But Vita was optimistic that patients who had switched to U.S. rival Biogen's Avonex product may soon return to the Schering drug &quot;as we feel the dosage in Avonex is too low.&quot;</p>
<p>Some patients may have switched to the other product as side-effects, including flu-like symptoms, experienced with Betaferon are said to be less with Avonex, Schering said.</p>
<p>Biogen received Food and Drug Administration approval for Avonex this spring and Israeli group Teva has received preliminary approval for its product Copaxone this fall.</p>
<p>Betaferon, making up 11 percent of Schering's total sales, is the group's biggest single selling product but Vita stressed Schering also had other very promising products.</p>
<p>&quot;Betaferon is a very important product for us but we are not just Betaferon, we have other pillars too.&quot;</p>
