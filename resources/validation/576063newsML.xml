<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan dollar ends at 11-month low on stock tumble.</title>
<headline>Taiwan dollar ends at 11-month low on stock tumble.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-05-12</dateline>

<p>The Taiwan dollar tumbled to its lowest close in nearly a year on Monday, as a big politically inspired stock-market tumble triggered strong outflows of funds to better-performing markets overseas, dealers said.</p>
<p>The local unit sank steadly through the day, dipping as low as T$27.775 to the U.S. dollar before ending at T$27.759 against Saturday's T$27.660 close.</p>
<p>It was the Taiwan dollar's lowest close since a T$27.790 finish on June 8, 1996.  </p>
<p>Turnover through dealers was a hectic US$348.5 million.</p>
<p>Taiwan's stock market, beset by political jitters ahead of a planned cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday, plunged 3.72 percent or 307.55 points on Monday to close at 7,966.64 -- the index's lowest level since March 25 -- as support at 8,000 evaporated.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock market plunge prompted many investors to withdraw their funds and invest them elsewhere, like in Hong Kong where the market is hot,&quot; said one dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The political jitters have more direct impact on the stock market than forex, but the indirect impact is the same.&quot;</p>
<p>Hong Kong's share index soared to a record close on Monday.  </p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar has been on a slow downtrend for most of 1997, with the central bank pledging a hands-off policy for the domestic foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>An even stronger statement of laissez-faire intent one year ago -- the central bank's decision to junk a decade-old defence of the Taiwan dollar at T$27.5 -- that sparked a significant, albeit temporary, depreciation to within a few cents of T$28.</p>
<p>Within weeks it had rebounded to stabilise around T$27.5.</p>
<p>Dealers said bank intervention this time is unlikely.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank is letting the Taiwan dollar fall because the fall is purely market-driven,&quot; the foreign bank dealer said.  </p>
<p>The central bank steadfastly defended the currency at T$27.5 in early 1996 when political and military tensions with rival China triggered a wave of capital outflow and a stock selloff.</p>
<p>It openly renounced intervention in May 1996 as tensions eased and has reaffirmed the hands-off policy many times since, most recently after a board meeting on Thursday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the central bank was allowing a depreciation in a strategy aimed at boosting exports, the island's lifeblood.</p>
<p>Taiwan in April posted a US$203.5 million trade deficit as exports slipped a year-on-year 2.5 percent to US$9.84 billion.</p>
