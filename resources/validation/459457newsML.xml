<p>U.S. Midcontinent diesel fuel prices were seen firming in the coming weeks on seasonal agricultural demand during the spring planting season, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>The seasonal demand was expected to draw down stocks in the regional pipeline system and provide support for spot prices in the near term, particularly in the Midwest's Group Three market.</p>
<p>&quot;That's going to pull out some of the diesel in Williams,&quot; one trader said of the key regional pipeline system.  </p>
<p>The Williams pipeline system ended the week with a 33-day supply of low sulphur diesel and 25-day supply of unleaded gasoline stocks on hand.</p>
<p>The Midwest markets on Friday wrapped up a lackluster week of trading with a fifth straight day of thin trade. &quot;The market has been extremely quiet,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Low sulphur diesel was talked 4.25/4.50 cents a gallon over the print in Group Three and 3.75/4.00 cents over the print in Chicago for all March timings, traders said.</p>
<p>Winter-grade unleaded in Chicago was talked 7.06.75 cents a gallon under the print ahead of a seasonal changeover in specifications next month.</p>
<p>Group Three unleaded gasoline firmed to bids 2.75 cents a gallon under NYMEX April unleaded for prompt and later deliveries, traders said.</p>
