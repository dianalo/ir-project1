<headline>UK stocks outlook--eyeing 5,000 level on FTSE 100.</headline>

<p>A week of successive record highs for London shares, with some blue chip stocks hit by violent price swings, means market watchers are reluctant to call the top of the current bull market.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 shied away three times from the 5,000 level and a move through that resistance point in the coming week could be the cue for a further push into record territory, analysts said.</p>
<p>Yet some believe the FTSE has shot its bolt in the past week and fresh gains may be hard to come by in the next five sessions.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not surprised by the rebound we've seen but I would be surprised if the market really takes off from here,&quot; said Gary Dugan, London-based investment strategist at U.S. investment bank JP Morgan.</p>
<p>Dugan said UK shares looked relatively good value compared with other continental European markets, yet the backdrop of strong sterling and rising interests favoured gilts over shares.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is cheap but I think it has to get cheaper still before there is a strong case to buy,&quot; Dugan said.</p>
<p>Others however were less pessimistic over the near-term outlook, despite the FTSE 100's 20 percent rise so far this year. The index hit a record 4,998.1 early in Friday's session before slipping back later in the day.</p>
<p>The market's recent strength, despite expectations that the Bank of England will add to its quarter-point rate rise earlier this month, has sparked renewed debate about the valuation of the market and the reasons for recent strength.</p>
<p>UK economic reports in the coming week, including retail sales figures for June and GDP for the second quarter, were seen as unlikely to disturb the picture of funds flowing into equities as bearish factors are discounted and fade away.</p>
<p>&quot;Short rates are going up but gilt yields are likely to converge with the rest of Europe, and the valuation case (for UK equities) is strong,&quot; said Richard Davidson, investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, &quot;and I think GDP is strong enough to help earnings and stock markets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have been in a fairly frenzied situation,&quot; said Davidson, &quot;it has been akin to Japan in the late 1980's, but then the market was overvalued for three and a half years before it blew up.&quot;</p>
<p>Meantime attention next week may switch back to the U.S., where Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan on Thursday delivers his second Humphrey-Hawkins testimony of the year on the state of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>As usual, any hint from Greenspan of a risk of rising growth in the second half and upward pressure on interest rates could spook markets on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Yet in his last Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in March, Greenspan sparked a sharp Wall Street rise with comments that he was not out to deflate equities through rising interest rates.</p>
<p>Greenspan had previously briefly rattled world markets by warning of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in stock markets. Yet in March Greenspan acknowledged: &quot;You cannot affect the broad level of equity values by jaw-boning... there is not way you can talk down or talk up prices or interest rates.&quot;</p>
<p>Another concern across Europe in the coming week could come with a French budget audit, due on Monday, that will decide what action is needed in preparation for European monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see why the French are having an audit unless there is bad news to be told and they want to push back EMU,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;It could make for a bullet through the heart of the ECU and that will impact on sterling.&quot;</p>
<p>Companies reporting next week include Reuters Holdings Plc, Imperial Chemical Industries Plc and SmithKline Beecham Plc.</p>
