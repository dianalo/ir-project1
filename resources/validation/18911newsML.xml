<p>North Sea spot crude premiums edged lower on Wednesday as sellers struggled to place prompt barrels and the U.S. arbitrage narrowed further, traders said.</p>
<p>Most North Sea grades with prompt loading dates were suffering from a lack of local refinery demand and the absence of a workable arbitrage to the U.S.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to have stalled a bit but maybe the buyers will start to come out at the lower numbers,&quot; said a North Sea seller.</p>
<p>Statfjord, Oseberg and Gullfaks were the weakest but Ekofisk was gaining some support from talk of production problems.  </p>
<p>Some loadings of Ekofisk crude in September have been delayed by a day due to lower than expected production.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ekofisk programme has been deferred by a day for cargoes loading September 10-17,&quot; said a trader familiar with the system's operations.</p>
<p>A cargo loading Sept 23 fetched Dated Brent +35 cents a barrel, which traders described as a strong premium compared to other grades.</p>
<p>Prompt Oseberg traded at Dated Brent +15 cents, with late pricing, while Statfjord moved at around Dated Brent +15/+18 cents, traders said.  </p>
<p>Oct Brent paper was nearly 50 cents stronger at $20.50 a barrel on Wednesday afternoon, pulled higher by strong products markets in the United States.</p>
<p>Paper spreads were steady from early levels with Sept/Oct at +43/+46 cents, but Dated Brent was mired around 25/30 cents below September with two or three cargoes available, traders said.</p>
<p>CFDs were marked slightly softer to reflect the bearish spot market sentiment, dealers said.</p>
