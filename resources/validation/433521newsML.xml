<p>Venezuela's $2.2 billion Petrozuata oil joint venture between state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela subsidiary Maraven and Dupont Co's Conoco is winning approval among bankers who are being asked to fund more than half the deal.</p>
<p>But there are still concerns that Venezuela won't be able to hold up its end of the deal, banking sources said.</p>
<p>Petrozuata, a 50-50 joint venture, would produce, upgrade and export Venezuelan extra-heavy crude from the vast Orinoco Tar Belt. It is likely to pump about 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) of extra-heavy crude and upgrade it into 104,000 bpd of 21 API gravity &quot;synthetic&quot; crude for export.</p>
<p>Investors are keeping a close eye on the financial fortunes of Petrozuata as a barometer for the success of five other Orinoco upgrading deals with top U.S. and European companies worth an estimated $15 billion.</p>
<p>The project is likely to win an investment-grade rating (Triple-B or better) from at least one of the top U.S. credit-rating agencies, sources say.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a very good possibility that this project will get an investment grade rating,&quot; a financial source said. &quot;It's a good project.&quot;</p>
<p>The rating will determine how much of the $1.3 billion debt portion of the project can be tapped from the capital markets.</p>
<p>Maraven and Conoco are now courting commercial banks to complement a proposed bond offering. But with or without a strong rating, many bankers are jittery over Venezuelan sovereign risk.</p>
<p>&quot;If this project was in Canada, I can say unequivocally it would be a slam-dunk,&quot; one banker said. &quot;If there's any credit risk at all, it's with Venezuela.&quot;</p>
<p>Another banker echoed that concern: &quot;There's a very recent history of exchange controls. For us, that's a very big concern. There are also political concerns, just listen to the talk of coup rumors...Looking at a 10-year window, we don't know what's going to happen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's all going to boil down to how we view sovereign risk,&quot; another banker said.</p>
<p>Venezuela has a sovereign credit rating of Single-B from Standard &amp; Poor's and Ba2 from Moody's, both below investment grade.</p>
<p>But Venezuelan risk isn't the only concern among bankers. Some worry what could happen if Dupont spins off Conoco, as Dupont officials have suggested in the past.</p>
<p>&quot;What roles will Conoco and Dupont play? Who will sign the contract?&quot; one financial source asked, alluding to the possibility that Conoco might not have the means to guarantee the loan without Dupont's financial muscle behind it.</p>
<p>One banker insisted that Dupont would be obliged to guarantee the debt even if it sold off Conoco.</p>
