<p>Eight elderly veterans, pretending to be musical missionaries, lured more than 10 school children into their homes and raped them repeatedly over two years, Taiwan authorities alleged on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The island's central Taichung district court has detained seven of the veterans, all over 70 years old, and released the eighth on bail, a Taichung prosecutor said by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;The veterans would tell the children they wanted to bring them home to teach them gospel music, and instead would sexually abuse or rape the children before releasing them,&quot; prosecutor Wu Tsui-fang said.</p>
<p>The veterans offered candy or petty cash to lure the children, all of them primary school pupils, into returning for more abuse, Wu said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the children even went back with classmates because of the candy and money,&quot; Wu said.</p>
<p>She said there was one boy among the more than 10 pupils raped over two years before the activities were discovered.</p>
<p>Police were tipped to the case after school teachers began noticing physcial signs of sexual abuse on the children and discovered that some of the poorer children were carrying unusually large sums of money.</p>
<p>Wu said the veterans would be charged with statutory rape and illegal sex solicitation, and could be sentenced to five years or more if found guilty.</p>
