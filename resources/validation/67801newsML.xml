<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch shares nudged higher by Wall Street at close.</title>
<headline>Dutch shares nudged higher by Wall Street at close.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-09-20</dateline>

<p>Dutch shares ended higher in a thin Friday's trading, Wall Street offering a helping hand at the close.</p>
<p>The AEX index was up 1.89 points at 565.70, just down from a late afternoon high of 566.41.</p>
<p>Main features of the session were gains for Philips Electronics and chemical group DSM, moderate losses for airline KLM and the expiry of September options contracts.</p>
<p>Philips firmed an initial 1.10 guilders as the market caught up with gains made in New York on Thursday. The stock closed up 1.40 to 59.30 guilders.</p>
<p>DSM hit a session high of 171.40 in the morning, before backing down to 168.00 at the close, a gain of 2.00 guilders.</p>
<p>The company ended its two days of presentations to analysts and traders offered a mixed bag of explanations for the reversal of Thursday's losses.</p>
<p>Some said the strength was the result of the company's announcement on Thursday that it expected product price rises. Others said the growth of the company's polycarbonate activities held the key.</p>
<p>KLM dropped one guilder to 43.40, but traders were increasingly inclining to buy.</p>
<p>&quot;We're thinking of picking it up. The stock has gone down much too fast. Maybe the news of cuts at British Airways had a negative effect (on KLM),&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Friday's close also marked the expiry of September options. Traders said there was little market vigour apart from essential position squaring. However, Friday's modest gains and the expectation of a firm Wall Street opening led to demand for AEX call options at 565.00 which subsequently came into the money.</p>
