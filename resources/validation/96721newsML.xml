<p>An Irishman who was badly injured by an IRA bomb in London earlier this year and then came under suspicion as an accomplice of the bomber has died in hospital after an asthma attack, Irish television said on Friday.</p>
<p>Brendan Woolhead, 33, suffered a fractured skull, pelvis and leg when a bomb exploded on a London bus in February.</p>
<p>He was kept under armed guard in hospital because police suspected he was with the bomber, who was killed when the bomb he was carrying exploded prematurely.</p>
<p>Police later pronounced Woolhead innocent and he left hospital a few weeks later.</p>
<p>Ireland's state-owned RTE television service said that during a visit to London this week, Woolhead suffered an asthma attack and was taken to hospital where he died.</p>
<p>Woolhead's parents could not be reached at their Dublin home Friday evening.</p>
<p>However, the London Evening Standard newspaper quoted his mother as telling it: &quot;He died of natural causes. I can't blame anyone for this. I don't think he would have done.&quot;</p>
