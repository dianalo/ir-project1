<p>Volatility in Micron Electronics Inc options spiked higher Tuesday as the shares dropped sharply on heavy volume, traders said.</p>
<p>Micron Electronics ended down 5-3/8 at 18-5/8 on turnover of about 7.7 million shares.</p>
<p>Traders said the stock fell on rumors of disappointing news from the company after it cancelled a presentation at a Smith Barney technology conference.</p>
<p>The company later said it expected its third quarter results would be hurt by personal computer price cuts and start-up costs for international operations.  </p>
<p>Micron also said it expected gross margins for the period to be two to three percentage points below its second quarter and personal computer sales to be 10 percent below second quarter sales.</p>
<p>In the options, traders said volatilities in the June series rose to around 85 percent from 65 percent.</p>
<p>Volatilities in the May series, which expires at the end of the week, rose well over 100 percent, traders said.</p>
<p>Jon Najarian, president of Mercury Trading, said that as the stock declined, investors were almost exclusively buying May puts for protection in the remaining days of the May cycle.  </p>
<p>At the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Micron Electronics May 20 put traded 790 contracts, the May 22-1/2 put traded about 425 and the May 17-1/2 put traded 400.</p>
<p>The busiest Micron Electronics option overall was the May 22-1/2 call, which traded a total of 4,612 contracts.</p>
<p>Micron Electronics options trade on the CBOE, the Pacific Exchange and the American Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>At the Pacific Exchange, the May 20 call traded about 1,500 contracts, the May 22-1/2 call traded 1,245 and the May 20 put traded 880, rounding out the top three.</p>
