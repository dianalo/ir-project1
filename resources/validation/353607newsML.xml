<p>South Africa suggested on Tuesday it would take a tougher line on nuclear waste shipments past its coast, saying a British-registered ship carrying radioactive material had broken a promise over its planned route.</p>
<p>Pallo Jordan, minister of environmental affairs and tourism, said in a statement the Pacific Teal came within 90 miles of the South African coast on Sunday despite assurances that it would not enter the 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ).</p>
<p>&quot;It is the considered judgment of this ministry that undertakings given to us by the operators of the Pacific Teal have been broken,&quot; Jordan said.</p>
<p>&quot;The experience...will inform South Africa's future response to the shipment of radioactive waste,&quot; he said without elaborating.</p>
<p>The ship is carrying vitrified plutonium waste back to Japan from France where it was reprocessed. The shipment is among the first of about 30.</p>
<p>The shippers have faced opposition from several countries with coastlines along possible routes, including New Zealand, Argentina and Portugal.</p>
<p>Jordan said a joint team representing the French, British and Japanese companies involved had told his ministry in December the craft would sail &quot;well clear of South Africa's EEZ&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We would have expected the operators of the Pacific Teal to exercise greater sensitivity in this matter, especially in the light of the concerns South Africa had expressed in our earlier exchanges,&quot; he said.</p>
