<p>Tractors began rolling across Russian fields on Monday, starting a harvest campaign which may barely improve on last year's mediocre record and which could see farmers protesting against the sector's collapse.</p>
<p>Russia is facing its third poor grain harvest in a row, forecasting net output of around 70 million tonnes, which would number among the worst results in three decades.</p>
<p>The collapse of the farm sector, once heavily subsidised by the government but now struggling to scrape by on minimal handouts, has outraged farmers, and Interfax news agency said labour disruptions were possible.</p>
<p>Alexander Davydov, chairman of the farm lobby's main trade union, was quoted as saying he could not rule out a wave of peasant reaction if there is not more evidence of government support.</p>
<p>He criticised the head of the government, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, for releasing only half of the 12 trillion roubles ($2 billion) budgeted for the sector for the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Farmers, hoping to improve on last year's drought-hit total harvest of 69.3 million tonnes, had started gathering winter grains in the fertile Krasnodar region in the south, Interfax said, quoting the Agriculture Ministry's Ivan Gridasov.</p>
<p>The State Statistics Committee put total grain sowings at 53.45 million hectares, down one percent on last year's levels.</p>
<p>Total wheat plantings were flat at 25.7 million hectares. But the feed grain sowings total slipped nine percent on last year to 32 million hectares, with maize plantings down by one million hectares.</p>
<p>Interfax said sugar beet sowings fell 12 percent to 944,000 hectares from 1996's 1.07 million hectares. Plantings of sunflowerseeds, a crop Russian farmers find t attractive, fell 10 percent to 3.55 million hectares.</p>
<p>SovEcon, an independent agricultural consultancy, estimated Russia's wheat imports, not including wheat flour, from July 1996 to June 1997 at just 1.55 million tonnes, 50 percent down on the previous season.</p>
<p>Russia once produced crops of 115 million tonnes and more in the Soviet era but output has contracted by around 40 percent, and the 1995 harvest, at 63.5 million tonnes, was the single worst in three decades.</p>
<p>But consumption has also changed, with farmers raising fewer livestock, growing increasingly smaller amounts of feed grain and people eating less bread.</p>
<p>Imports now make up around half of Russia's entire food market -- a sore point with farmers whose products, even when manufactured in adequate quantities, cannot compete. ($ = 5767 Russian Roubles)</p>
