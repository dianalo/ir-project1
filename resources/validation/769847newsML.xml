<p>Nearly half of senior German economists expect the dollar to continue recent gains in coming weeks with only a small minority looking for a weaker U.S. currency, a survey published on Thursday said.</p>
<p>According to a survey of 27 economists polled by Boerse Online magazine, 46 percent said they expected the dollar to continue climbing while many believed the Bundesbank would not step in to check its advance by intervening in the open market.</p>
<p>Some 42 percent of those contacted said they expected the dollar to at least remain at current levels and only 12 percent said they expected it to fall.</p>
<p>The magazine provided a summary of the survey ahead of its official publication.</p>
<p>The dollar has climbed steadily in recent months to its highest level against the mark for more than seven years. It traded near 1.8400 marks late on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Asked where the dollar would stand a year from now, the economists said on average the currency would retreat somewhat to 1.77 marks.</p>
