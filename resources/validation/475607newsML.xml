<p>Relief workers are racing against time to move thousands of exhausted Rwandan Hutu refugees away from Zaire's third city of Kisangani after rebels extended a deadline until Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;They have to move, otherwise there is a risk they could be pushed back by the military,&quot; Kilian Kleinschmidt of the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said by telephone from the city, which rebels captured on March 15.</p>
<p>The rebels, who include many ethnic Tutsis, have stopped the U.N. World Food Programme and other relief agencies from feeding 20,000 Hutus at Lula, seven km (four miles) south of Kisangani.</p>
<p>They say relief agencies must move the refugees, who fled west with Hutu hardliners blamed for the 1994 genocide of minority Tutsis in Rwanda, to a site 25 km (15 miles) further south.</p>
<p>The refugees reached Lula, heading for Kisangani, after a four-month trek through the jungle to escape Zaire's rebel war. They were first ordered to leave Lula by Sunday, but U.N. officials won an extension of the deadline.</p>
<p>U.N. officials said they were doing all they could to help the refugees to comply with the rebel order by providing transport and other facilities.</p>
<p>The rebels gave no reason for their ultimatum. Hutu hardliners have in the past used refugees as human shields and Red Cross officials say rebels have killed about 100 armed Hutus in clashes since taking Kisangani.</p>
<p>Relief workers are using a train to deliver food, water and medicine to up to 40,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees gathered at a point on a railway line 40 km (25 miles) south of Kisangani.</p>
<p>Witnesses have said that bodies litter the rain forest in the area and that thousands more of the refugees could die without emergency help.</p>
<p>The rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL) control about a quarter of Zaire after taking up arms in October to topple President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>Mobutu, who seized power in 1965, has been ailing since undergoing prostate cancer surgery in Europe last August and appears to be losing his grip on the sprawling Central African nation.</p>
<p>Zaire, potentially one of Africa's richest countries,  has been impoverished by rampant official corruption and administrative inefficiency.</p>
<p>Rebels spokesmen say negotiations with Mobutu envoys  and other politicians, agreed on the sidelines of an Organisation of African Unity summit in Togo, could start as early as this week, probably in South Africa.</p>
