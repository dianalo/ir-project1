<headline>LME copper stops short of $2,300, others mixed.</headline>

<p>LME copper rebounded from a test near the psychological $2,300 per tonne level on Wednesday afternoon, giving a late boost to several other metals.</p>
<p>Successive waves of selling, largely fund liquidation, pressured three month copper prices, which bottomed out at $2,305 before prices bounced on short-covering and trade buying.</p>
<p>The market finished with pared losses of $8 at $2,325, but remained mired below the 30-day moving average of $2,331.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still a bearish close and suggests that we'll come down to fill a gap that extends to $2,295,&quot; said analyst Robin Bahr of broker Brandeis.  </p>
<p>Nickel joined copper in a modest rally, bouncing off a low of $7,870 to finish the day back above the 30-day moving average and within striking distance of the $8,000 mark.</p>
<p>The market ended with a gain of $80 at $7,985, but needs to move convincingly back above $8,000 before the bearish tone can be dispelled, Bahr said.</p>
<p>&quot;Until we regain the $8,000 level, any rallies will be sold into,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Aluminium also got a minor boost from copper's rebound, prying itself loose of the $1,640 level it had held most of the day to close at its high of $1,647, a gain of $5.</p>
<p>The market was still ensconced between the 10-day and 30-day moving averages, the latter which should offer support at $1,634.</p>
<p>Zinc woke up on the afternoon kerb and marched towards the $1,300 level, topping out $2 shy of the psychological target after earlier in the day extending as low as $1,282.</p>
<p>Last business on the kerb was near the highs at $1,296, up $6.</p>
<p>The market seemed to be consolidating before re-attacking Monday's fresh peak of $1,307, chartists said.</p>
<p>The rallies in the others, however, failed to stimulate lead, pressured by Far Eastern selling after stalling at peaks of $710 for the past two days.</p>
<p>The market, however, clawed off its low of $686 to end $17 weaker at $691.</p>
<p>The move above $700 had been largely option-inspired ahead of Third Wednesday pricing, but now the March date has passed, prices could slide further, Bahr said.</p>
<p>&quot;There may not be anything to hold it up now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tin tested the $6,000 level, but managed to remain above it and the 10-day moving average of $5,993.</p>
<p>The afternoon's last trade was at $6,035, a gain of $5.</p>
<p>Alloy ended $5 weaker at $1,540.</p>
