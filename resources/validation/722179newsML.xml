<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates opened up 90 basis points at 18.10 percent on Friday on what dealers said was mainly a technical correction after a late dip during the prior session.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is very firm, the increase we're seeing is no more than an adjustment from yesterday's closing rate, which was very low,&quot; a trader said, who added he did not expect rates to gain further during the session.</p>
<p>&quot;The market looks good, with trade and inflation figures, and just look at the exchange rate, that tells you everything,&quot; the trader added.  </p>
<p>Banco de Mexico announced on Wednesday that consumer inflation for June was 0.89 percent, the lowest monthly figure since the December 1994 peso crisis. The Finance Ministry on Thursday revised May's trade surplus up to $220 million, from a deficit of $88 million.</p>
<p>Benchmark 48-hour peso contracts were meanwhile 1.95 centavos stronger at 7.8510/7.8555 per dollar.    Overnight</p>
<p>rates on bank paper were down 10 percent to 18.50 percent.</p>
<p>Liquidity of 973 million pesos was due to return to the system from prior central bank operations.</p>
