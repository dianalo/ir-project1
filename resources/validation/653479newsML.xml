<title>USA: CBOT soymeal ends sharply up on exports, El Nino.</title>
<headline>CBOT soymeal ends sharply up on exports, El Nino.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-11</dateline>

<p>July soymeal futures ended sharply higher Wednesday on talk of Chinese demand and worries over a developing El Nino weather pattern, traders said.</p>
<p>Soyoil futures also ended with solid gains, boosted by a rally in nearby soybeans.</p>
<p>Concerns that an El Nino weather pattern will cause drought in some oilseed and grain growing regions helped rally most CBOT soy complex prices, traders said.</p>
<p>El Nino has the potential to reduce monsoon rains in India and affect that country's oilseed production, according to the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World.</p>
<p>&quot;Due to El Nino, monsoon rains in India could be weaker and more erratic than usual,&quot; Oil World said, noting that an El Nino-inspired-drought in 1987 caused major production losses.</p>
<p>China was also seen buying 60,000 tonnes of soymeal from South American sources overnight for July/August delivery, traders in Asia said.</p>
<p>CBOT July soymeal settled up $7.40 per ton at $274.10 a ton, and other months were $2.00 to $5.20 higher. July soyoil settled up 0.22 cent a lb at 23.17 cents and other months ended down 0.02 to 0.19 higher.  </p>
<p>On the day in soymeal trade, Continental Grain bought 400 lots December, LIT bought 400 July and Smith Barney sold 500 July, pit traders said.</p>
<p>In soyoil trade, ADM sold 300 lots August and bought 100 lots July, traders said.</p>
<p>Soymeal futures volume was estimated by CBOT at 30,000 lots, compared with Tuesday's actual volume of 28,862 lots. Soyoil volume was pegged at 16,00 lots against Tuesday's 18,640 lots.</p>
