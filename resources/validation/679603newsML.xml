<p>British conglomerate Lonrho Plc, which is in the throes of a major shake-up, Monday reported lower first-half profits and made clear the end of its planned overhaul is not in sight.</p>
<p>Lonrho's first-half pre-tax profit fell to 38 million pounds ($62.9 million) from 61 million ($101.0 million), coming in exactly as analysts had expected.</p>
<p>Revenues slipped to 1.01 billion pounds ($1.67 billion) from 1.04 billion ($1.72 billion).</p>
<p>The results exclude a net profit on the disposal earlier this year of Lonrho Sugar for 129 million pounds ($213.6 million). This was used to repay debts, Lonrho said.</p>
<p>Lonrho's talks to merge its mining business with South Africa's JCI Ltd continue, but the British group emphasised that the negotiations, first announced last month, were still in a preliminary stage.</p>
<p>&quot;It is too early to say whether a merger is possible or likely. Talks are continuing, but there is no commitment,&quot; Chief Executive Nick Morrell told Reuters.</p>
<p>A Lonrho-JCI merger would create a global mining powerhouse with a market capitalisation around $3 billion.</p>
<p>Morrell said he expected the sale of Lonrho's Princess hotels to be completed by end-September after negotiations began last year.</p>
<p>The planned split off of the company's African trading business was complex, but Lonrho expects it to be &quot;well advanced&quot; by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The ongoing merger, split-up and divestment talks are part of Lonrho's strategy, devised in 1995 and frequently adjusted afterwards, to streamline its operations.</p>
<p>Pre-tax results were hit by depressed precious metal prices in the six months to March 31, the strength of the pound and subdued trading in its African business, Lonrho said.</p>
<p>A lower contribution of Ghana's Ashanti Goldfields Co. Ltd, in which Lonrho has a 41 percent interest, also depressed profits.</p>
<p>South African mining giant Anglo American Corp. of South Africa and, most recently, its rival Gencor Ltd, are said to be interested in acquiring the Ashanti stake. But Lonrho wants to hold onto it. &quot;Ashanti is a very important asset and we have no plans at this stage to divest it,&quot; Morrell said.</p>
