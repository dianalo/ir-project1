<p>French President Jacques Chirac arrived in Tokyo amid tight security on Sunday to start a six-day visit to boost economic ties and restore relations damaged by French nuclear tests in the South Pacific last year.</p>
<p>In case of nuclear protests, police were on duty on roads around the luxurious and prestigious Hotel Okura where Chirac has chosen to base himself rather than the government-run State Guest House where foreign leaders normally stay.</p>
<p>Small anti-nuclear groups have vowed to demonstrate during the president's visit.</p>
<p>Chirac will spend four days in Tokyo as a state guest and then spend Thursday and Friday in Fukuoka in southwestern Japan, on an unofficial visit. He plans to see a sumo wrestling tournament during his unofficial stay.</p>
<p>Chirac has been in Japan 42 times in the past on official and private visits but this is his first visit since he became president in May last year.</p>
<p>In a Japanese newspaper interview on the eve of his arrival, Chirac said France wanted Tokyo to play a more active role in international affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;In a period of world crisis, France looks to Japan as an important player to consult with,&quot; Chirac told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.</p>
<p>The Franco-Japanese summit is intended to &quot;restore&quot; bilateral relations, according to Japanese officials, after Japanese public outrage over France's South Pacific nuclear tests which began in September last year.</p>
<p>Since the end of the Mururoa undersea blasts, France has been promoting the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). It has vigorously advocated nuclear disarmament and opposed developing nations' attempts to create their own nuclear arsenals.</p>
<p>Economic talks are expected to focus on French demands that Japan open its insurance, construction, aircraft and car manufacturing industries to French companies.</p>
<p>In talks with Japanese premier Ryutaro Hashimoto on Monday, Chirac is expected to ask for Japanese help in handling the refugee crisis in Zaire.</p>
<p>Chirac recently called for intervention by a &quot;politically neutral&quot; multinational force to deliver food and medical aid to hundreds of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees now heading home from eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>On Monday, he will attend a welcoming ceremony at the Akasaka State Guesthouse, have an audience with Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko at the Imperial Palace, and hold talks with Hashimoto.</p>
