<p>The European Union called on Friday for greater international market access for its textile products, saying major world exporters were preventing European goods from competing fairly.</p>
<p>A spokesman for EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said an appeal for meaningful proposals to cut tariffs and quotas had met with little or no response from major textile exporters.</p>
<p>The European Commission -- the EU's executive -- is currently finalising its position for the second phase of a three-stage process by which global textile and garment agreements will be absorbed by the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>The thorny question of textiles and garments was considered under a separate agreement when the WTO took over the work of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade last year.</p>
<p>Under an Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ACT) of 1995, barriers are supposed to be rolled back within 10 years. Textile exporting nations are due to complete the second phase by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The EU is obliged to allow a further 17 percent of the volume of 1990's textile and garment imports to be liberalised next year, and is appealing for similar liberalisation in reciprocal markets -- chiefly in Asia.</p>
<p>Peter Guilford, spokesman for Brittan, said the Commission was very disappointed with the response so far.</p>
<p>&quot;Really, there has been nothing of note,&quot; he said. &quot;Time is running out if our partners hope to see movement.&quot;</p>
