<p>The World Bank has asked Bangladesh to reduce import tariffs and relax controls on investment and foreign exchange, to lift economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Bangladesh must act quickly to remove remaining hurdles to trade, in order to move the economy firmly on to the path of export-oriented development,&quot; the bank said in a report made available to Reuters on Monday.</p>
<p>It said Bangladesh had been pursuing reforms, but the pace of change remained slow.</p>
<p>The bank said the current corporate tax system and some controls on investment and foreign exchange increased the cost of doing business in Bangladesh, and also reduced the incentives for foreign invetsment.</p>
<p>Bangladesh must gear up its recent trade reforms for industrial production to expand as needed to keep economic growth high, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The government should commit to (a) pre-announced programme of across-the-board reform and move away from a made-to-measure approach of special exemptions and compensations,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The report said that the pre-announced programme was essential to reduce uncertainty in the business community.</p>
<p>The World Bank, a major Bangladesh donor, asked Dhaka to reform its tariff structure by introducing &quot;a three rate schedule of 10, 20 and 35 percent in the next budget, with zero rates only for imported inputs used by exporters.&quot;</p>
<p>Bangladesh's fiscal year begins on July 1.</p>
<p>The Washington-based bank said the government should also announce low rates between zero to 20 percent for 1999/2000. &quot;A maximum rate of 20 percent would retain some protection for domestic industry against any alleged foreign dumping.&quot;</p>
<p>It said Bangladesh must ensure exporters access to adequate and dependable power, telecommunications and other infrastructures.</p>
<p>The country must also increase port facilities to speed up clearance of goods. It should consider private participation in inland container depots and leasing of container berths to private operators.</p>
<p>The bank said despite policy change, cross-border illegal trade between Bangladesh and India persisted.</p>
<p>A survey of cross-border flows between Bangladesh and India found that illegal imports from India into Bangladesh was worth $519 million in 1994 which greatly exceded Dhaka's official exports of $126 million.</p>
<p>&quot;This trade has been facilitated by the different pace of trade liberalisation in the two countries. Bangladesh has liberalised its import regime faster than India, but border price differentials (are) still significant enough to ensure the profitability of illegal trade,&quot; it said.</p>
