<headline>S.Korean won ends higher on intervention worries.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1997-03-12</dateline>

<p>The won closed stronger versus the dollar on Wednesday as fears of a central bank intervention froze dollar buying sentiment, dealers said.</p>
<p>The won closed at 877.30 after opening at 878.80. It traded in a range of 876.40 to 879.10.</p>
<p>Dealers said the local unit's sharp fall this week has prompted talks of possible intervention.</p>
<p>Moreover, inflow of foreign funds for equity investment in the Seoul bourse also heightened the won's demand, they said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is likely to fall to the 875 won level before rebounding due to heavy dollar positions,&quot; said one local bank dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar could be kept at the 880 won level until the end of March with the central bank intervening once or twice,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The dollar has surged more than nine won this week on the back of growing import deals and speculative buying.</p>
<p>Dealers said the won was expected to move in a range of 876.50 to 879.50 on Thursday with the base mid-rate at 877.80. Today's mid rate was pegged at 877.70.</p>
