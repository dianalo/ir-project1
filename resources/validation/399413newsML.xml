<title>TURKEY: British envoy in Turkey for Cyprus talks.</title>
<headline>British envoy in Turkey for Cyprus talks.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-02-24</dateline>

<p>Britain's special envoy for Cyprus, Sir David Hannay, met Turkish officials in Ankara on Monday for talks on the future of the divided Mediterranean island, a foreign ministry official said.</p>
<p>&quot;He arrived yesterday and talks began this morning,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>State-run Anatolian news agency quoted Hannay as saying he hoped to bring Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot officials together for direct talks in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Tension on Cyprus increased last month in a row over Greek Cypriot plans to install Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles on the island. Turkey has threatened military action if the deployment takes place.</p>
<p>A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman said Ankara did not back Turkish far-rightist plans to storm the abandoned Cypriot resort town of Varosha at a demonstration on March 2.</p>
<p>&quot;A demonstration is one thing but factually, physically forcing the opening of Varosha is another thing,&quot; spokesman Omer Akbel told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Varosha lies empty on land between the Turkish Cypriot north of the island and the Greek Cypriot south. The United Nations holds Turkey responsible for the maintenance of the status quo there.</p>
<p>Rauf Denktash, the head of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state, has threatened to open Varosha to Turkish Cypriot settlement if the government brings the missiles from Russia.</p>
<p>The island has been divided since Turkey invaded in 1974 in response to a brief Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia that was backed by Athens.</p>
<p>The international community, except Ankara, recognises the Greek Cypriot administration as the island's only government.</p>
<p>A Greek Cypriot spokesman said on Monday that his government would complain to the United Nations about Turkish reconnaissance flights over the island.</p>
