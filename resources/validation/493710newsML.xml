<p>--------------------------- April 8------------------------</p>
<p>* Central Bank sells $56.0 million at 26.37 pesos</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Philippine peso closed a shade lower on Tuesday at 26.369 from 26.368 as the market remained cautious of possible outflows from the stock market, dealers said.</p>
<p>The day's average was at 26.368 from 26.365, with volume rising to $157.7 million from $127.1 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people are very cautious because of the selldown in the equities market,&quot; a dealer said.  </p>
<p>The threat of a possible outflow of stock market investments had prompted the Central Bank late on Tuesday to offer reverse repos maturing on April 10 at an increased rate of 10 percent, a dealer said.</p>
<p>Slower inflows for fixed income securities prodded the Central Bank to increase its rate, dealers said.</p>
<p>Despite the rate hike, the Central Bank still had to sell about $14 million at 26.37 in afternoon trades. For the whole day, it sold a total of $56 million at 26.37, dealers estimated.  </p>
<p>But a foreign bank dealer said the Central Bank's move on rates had already lured foreign funds to come back in the afternoon.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the peso is expected to be capped by the Central Bank at 26.37 if there would be outflows from stock market investments, dealers said.</p>
<p>One dealer said those foreign funds are believed to be currently parking short-term placements with banks.</p>
<p>Philippine financial markets are closed on Wednesday for a public holiday.</p>
