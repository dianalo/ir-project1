<p>A mid-reporting season malaise descended over the New Zealand share market with most leading stocks ending significantly lower on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 20.28 points down at 2,310.00 as investors struggled to find good reasons to buy. Turnover, at NZ$33 million, was relatively light.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing is jumping out and saying 'buy me' at this stage,&quot; Nigel Scott at BZW said. &quot;Overall sentiment is still pretty poor on very moderate to low volume,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Leading the pack among the top five was brewer Lion Nathan which lost 12 cents to NZ$3.61.  </p>
<p>Brokers said Lion was suffering after its main competitor, Foster's Brewing, reported robust earnings from its unit, Carlton and United Breweries, on Monday.</p>
<p>Fosters also reported it had 55 percent of the Australian beer market, indicating Lion had made little progress there.</p>
<p>Carter Holt Harvey's 53 percent plunge in nine-month profit to NZ$171 million was worse than forecast.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was little in the short term commodities outlook for investors to get enthused about.</p>
<p>Fletcher Challenge &quot;letter&quot; stocks also failed to garner support.  </p>
<p>Telecom, which made up a quarter of the volume, lost four cents to NZ$6.94 with one broker still as a still a net seller before its third quarter result on February 18.</p>
<p>Steel and Tube lost 10 cents after its result, but on very light volume. The company earlier reported a slight dip in first half earnings and said the current year's outcome was likely that for 1995/6.</p>
<p>Brierley Investments was the only leader to gain, rising one cent to NZ$1.32 in line with John Fairfax in Australia. BIL owns about 20 percent of the Australian publisher.</p>
