<p>The European Union's plans for new euro coins have hit a series of snags, forcing a high-level experts group to go back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>EU finance ministers have told the group -- made up of senior officials from national mints across the 15-nation bloc -- to reconsider both the shape of one of the proposed new coins and the metal content of two others.</p>
<p>Euro coins are due to enter circulation in 2002 in countries participating in the EU's economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Designs for the coins are currently being presented to a jury. The winning designs are expected to be unveiled at a summit of EU leaders in Amsterdam in June. The designs for notes were shown to EU leaders in Dublin in December.</p>
<p>The experts group has been dealing with the technical aspects of the coins, such as their shape, size and metal content.</p>
<p>EU officials said one of the main snags had arisen with the planned half-euro coin, the value of which against other currencies will not be known until 1999.</p>
<p>In order to help blind consumers differentiate between coins, the experts group has been suggesting that the half-euro coin be made with seven edges.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is that some parts of the vending machine industry, in particular some parts of the German industry, feel this could...introduce technical challenges,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>Several EU countries, including Britain and Ireland, have multi-edged coins. Some try to differentiate between coins by putting holes in them or adding special surfaces.</p>
<p>Another glitch has occurred in the plans for the 10- and 20-cent euro coins.</p>
<p>Urged on by Sweden, the finance ministers have ordered the experts to consider reducing the nickel content of the coins on health grounds.</p>
<p>Officials in Stockholm have expressed concern about protecting people who are allergic to nickel.</p>
<p>The experts group had wanted to make the content of euro coins the same as for most existing world currencies in order to facilitate recycling.</p>
