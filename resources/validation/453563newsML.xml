<headline>Clinton, Yeltsin should take it easy at summit.</headline>

<p>Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin may be squaring up for a tough fight at this week's summit meeting, but they would be well advised to pull their punches or risk doing themselves serious harm.</p>
<p>For this is potentially the summit of the invalids, with neither leader at 100 percent fitness.</p>
<p>The Helsinki summit was originally moved from Washington closer to Russia for the sake of 66-year-old Yeltsin, who underwent heart bypass surgery in November. Pneumonia set back his recovery even further.</p>
<p>But then Clinton, in a freak accident, lost his footing at the Florida home of Australian golf champion Greg Norman last week and tore a tendon in his knee.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad to see President Yeltsin up and around and healthy, and I appreciate, in light of my condition, that he agreed to move the meeting...to Helsinki so it will be a little closer to me,&quot; Clinton joked on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Clinton's injury, which required surgery, is temporary. He has generally been seen as brimming with good health since taking office, despite his self-confessed love of fast food.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, on the other hand, has suffered major health problems, following a long line of Soviet leaders who have wheezed and limped their way through major summits. Reports he has or had a drinking problem have been denied by the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Yeltsin hit the peak of his power and personal vitality in August 1991, when he defied a hardline coup against Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p>Film of Yeltsin clambering aboard a tank to speak to protesters -- his shock of white hair a symbol of action -- spread an image of a vital leader around Russia and the world.</p>
<p>But Yeltsin, fighting to reassert himself as leader, has fought back this year and now appears to be close to his old bouncy personality, teasing the U.S. president gently this week about his health problems.</p>
<p>&quot;You see nobody is insured against illness. Bill Clinton suddenly also got ill. They said that a sick Yeltsin and a healthy Clinton would come to Helsinki and it turns out the other way around,&quot; he said in Moscow.</p>
<p>While Yeltsin travels to Helsinki without any real problems, a Finnish doctor said Clinton risks suffering blood clots by flying to Finland so soon after an operation.</p>
<p>&quot;The president will definitely be given anti-coagulant medicines to prevent that risk,&quot; said Jerker Sandelin, deputy head physician of the orthopaedic department at Helsinki's Orton hospital.</p>
<p>Doctors said Clinton was likely to use a combination of crutches and a wheelchair during this week's Helsinki summit.</p>
<p>The image of an American president in a wheelchair evokes images of Franklin Roosevelt, president during World War Two, who was confined to a wheelchair for most of his life.</p>
<p>At the time Americans were kept in the dark about Roosevelt's illness.</p>
<p>The White House press corps is unlikely to be so generous towards Clinton this week and White House officials may be concerned about potential publicity disasters at the summit.</p>
<p>U.S. and Finnish officials declined to give any details of changes made to adapt buildings or accommodation to suit Clinton's temporary disability.</p>
<p>Sandelin said Clinton would not be able to put any weight on his bad leg and would need a footstool during his talks with Yeltsin.</p>
