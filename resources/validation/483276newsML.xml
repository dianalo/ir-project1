<title>CANADA: Bre-X can't explain test differences - CP.</title>
<headline>Bre-X can't explain test differences - CP.</headline>

<p>The head of Bre-X Minerals Ltd urged shareholders on Tuesday to be patient but found it hard to explain different test results from its Indonesian gold deposit, the Canadian Press news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;To the people that have been able to maintain their position, I say have patience,&quot; Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh said in an interview from Calgary with Canadian Press.</p>
<p>&quot;And for the people who were forced to sell, I feel for them. It's a tragedy but it's not of Bre-X's making.&quot;</p>
<p>Bre-X has been under heavy fire since last week when its partner in Indonesia, Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc, said its early drilling samples on the Busang gold property turned up &quot;insignificant&quot; amounts of gold. This led to a sharp drop in Bre-X's stock and shook the Canadian stock market.</p>
<p>Bre-X, which had previously stated the property could hold up to 71 million ounces of gold, publicly said on Tuesday it needed more time to study a report from engineering firm Kilborn SNC-Lavalin related to a check assay programme at Busang.</p>
<p>It also has hired the Canadian consulting firm Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd to audit drilling, sampling and assaying of the Busang project.</p>
<p>CP reported that Walsh said he did not believe anyone could have inflated test results by adding gold to the thousands of samples Bre-X pulled from underneath the Indonesian jungle: &quot;There's nothing impossible, but I'd say impossible.&quot;</p>
<p>He voiced confidence in the Bre-X exploration team in Indonesia and said discrepancies might come down to different testing techniques used by Bre-X and potential partner Freeport-McMoRan.</p>
<p>&quot;That is the only thing that comes to my mind, some kind of difference in assaying procedure,&quot; he was quoted as saying. &quot;That's the only possible explanation that I personally can think of.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't mean to be trite about this (but) we here at Bre- X... have one word for the discrepancies, and the word is mind- boggling.&quot;</p>
<p>Walsh said the answer should come in about a month from the Strathcona audit, CP reported. Walsh said he wanted to correlate that information with that of Kilborn's.</p>
<p>Asked if he could understand why some people were questioning the deposit, Walsh said: &quot;I don't know why they have the doubts that they have. Since we started this in 1993, we have consistently in one form or another been berated.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;It's human nature, people who want to be negative are going to be negative.&quot;</p>
