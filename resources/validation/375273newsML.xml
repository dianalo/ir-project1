<p>New President Fabian Alarcon assumes power under intense pressure to bring order to Ecuador's public finances but any attempt at austerity could fuel unrest of the kind that toppled his predecessor.</p>
<p>Alarcon was sworn in on Tuesday after the flamboyant former President Abdala Bucaram was dismissed by Congress on the grounds of &quot;mental incompetence&quot; following popular protests against austerity measures.</p>
<p>But political analysts say Alarcon will immediately face the same gaping budget deficit -- estimated by some at between five percent and six percent of gross domestic product -- which led Bucaram to swap populist policies for austerity.</p>
<p>&quot;He gained power riding a wave of protest against the economic reform programme, and it is going to be extremely hard to to make an about-turn and say, 'Well, we really need those policies after all',&quot; said Santiago Nieto, manager of private pollsters Informe Confidencial.</p>
<p>The threat, economists say, is resurgent inflation unless the budget deficit is reduced.</p>
<p>Bucaram's unpopular austerity measures, which included steep hikes in the cost of public services, have been suspended and Bucaram's plan to tie the sucre currency to the dollar was scrapped. But Alarcon, who was speaker of Congress before becoming president, has already begun to admit that something has to be done to improve national finances.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation in which we have received the country according to the first information we are receiving is really catastrophic,&quot; Alarcon told reporters, &quot;We have been on the verge of collapse, especially economically and socially.&quot;</p>
<p>Nieto noted that reducing the budget deficit is one of the targets agreed with the International Monetary Fund and failure to do so would put the country's access to international credit at risk.</p>
<p>&quot;(Alarcon) is going to be under intense pressure from the business sector to stabilise the economy, &quot; Nieto said, &quot;Business has already gone through two years of instability and they think that that's enough.&quot;</p>
<p>But the protesters who helped to throw Bucaram out warn they could take to the streets against Alarcon if necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;We will keep ourselves alert so that he responds to the demands of the people,&quot; Fausto Dutan, president of the United Workers Front labour group, told Reuters. &quot;The people do not want to make any more sacrifices right now.&quot;</p>
<p>Native Indian groups, who played a big role in the protests against Bucaram, have made similar statements.</p>
<p>The alliances which Alarcon had to make to become president have also worried analysts.</p>
<p>Officials close to the new president have said he will try and put together a broad coalition grouping several parties, and seek to pass policies by consensus.</p>
<p>But some fear the coalition may be wracked by argument.</p>
<p>&quot;They're putting dogs in together with rats and cats,&quot; said one analyst who reqeusted anonymity, &quot;There isn't going to be any consensus. The most likely thing is that one group is assigned management of the economy, and that another group gets control of social issues.&quot;</p>
