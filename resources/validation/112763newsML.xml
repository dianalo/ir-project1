<p>Political leaders voiced outrage on Saturday at what they dubbed &quot;Italy's Watergate&quot; after former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi announced he had found a bugging device hidden in his office.</p>
<p>Berlusconi, head of the centre-right opposition bloc, told a news conference on Friday that a small radio microphone was discovered on Wednesday in a window recess behind his desk in his central Rome headquarters.</p>
<p>&quot;Experts have told me it was in perfect working condition and capable of transmitting across a range of 300 metres,&quot; the media tycoon told reporters, holding up a black microphone the size and shape of a cigarette box.</p>
<p>Italian magistrates have used hi-tech bugging devices in a number of recent corruption investigations including the latest case involving alleged graft in some state-controlled firms.</p>
<p>Berlusconi, who is standing trial for alleged bribes paid by his Fininvest business empire in return for lenient audits, said his lawyers had assured him that magistrates were not allowed to use such devices against parliamentarians.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very serious situation, which is even more serious given that we are dealing with the leader of the opposition,&quot; Berlusconi said, adding that he had informed judicial authorities about the discovery.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to denounce this as a violation of my person, of my position as a parliamentarian and as leader of Forza Italia,&quot; added Berlusconi, premier for seven stormy months in 1994 after triumphantly entering politics with his new Forza Italia party.</p>
<p>Leaders across the political spectrum voiced indignation at the news of the bugging.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi, whose centre-left coalition defeated Berlusconi's conservative alliance in elections last April, said he wanted more details but would call for a full investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;Bugging devices are a totally indecent and uncivil matter for a respectable country,&quot; Prodi told reporters at a conference in the central city of Bologna on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously, I will ask for a complete investigation and demand that we get to the bottom of this,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Rome prosecutor Giuseppe Volpari said on Saturday his office was studying the possibility of opening a probe.</p>
<p>Rocco Buttiglione, head of a small Roman Catholic party allied with Berlusconi, compared the incident to the Watergate scandal, which involved spying on political adversaries and led to the resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1974.</p>
<p>&quot;If it turns out that this bug was planted by organs of the state, then we will be faced with a scandal not inferior to Watergate,&quot; Buttiglione told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a grave violation of the right of privacy, and it is even more serious given that it involves a member of parliament who is also head of the opposition,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Newspapers entertained a range of theories on who may have planted the bug, including political opponents, magistrates, corrupt members of the secret service or even the possibility that the media tycoon was a victim of industrial espionage.</p>
<p>Roberto Maroni, a member of the secessionist Northern League and interior minister in Berlusconi's cabinet, pointed the finger back at the former premier.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Berlusconi planted the bug himself,&quot; Maroni was quoted as saying in Rome's La Repubblica daily.</p>
<p>&quot;He wanted to create a stir. Nowadays the only one who uses bugs like that is James Bond. Real spys plant microphones that can work from hundreds of metres away.&quot;</p>
