<p>France said on Wednesday it had made no final decision on issuing a postage stamp commemorating president Charles de Gaulle's fiery 1967 visit to Quebec, an idea which has prompted an official protest from Ottawa.</p>
<p>De Gaulle cheered Quebec separatists but outraged the federal Canadian government with an impassioned Montreal speech supporting the province's independence with the cry &quot;Vive le Quebec libre&quot; (Long live a free Quebec).</p>
<p>He had to curtail his visit to Canada because of the furore caused by the speech.</p>
<p>Asked about reported plans for the stamp, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt told reporters: &quot;The Canadian authorities have expressed their concern.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a plan. If it is a plan that means no decision has been taken,&quot; he said, adding that France wanted relations with Ottawa to be as warm as possible.</p>
<p>De Gaulle's call is credited with having boosted separatist sentiments in Quebec just as Canada was celebrating its centennial, and it remains a sore point in diplomatic relations between Canada and France.</p>
