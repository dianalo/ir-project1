<p>British banking giant National Westminster Bank Plc Monday issued a profit warning and announced that the chief executive of its investment banking unit, NatWest Markets, had resigned.</p>
<p>NatWest said in a statement Martin Owen had resigned with immediate effect and would be replaced by NatWest chief Derek Wanless until a replacement could be found.</p>
<p>Owen's future has been under question since late February when NatWest Markets disclosed it had sustained multi-million dollar losses in its derivatives division over a sustained period. The value of derivatives are based on an underlying security or commodity.</p>
<p>His departure coincides with a major shift in focus by NatWest Markets, which had aimed to be one of the top 10 global investment banking firms.</p>
<p>The bank did not say why Owen was leaving but paid tribute to his &quot;considerable contribution.&quot; Owen has been head of the investment bank since 1992.</p>
<p>The group also disclosed the full impact of the interest rate options losses uncovered in February by warning profits for the whole group for the first half of the year would not exceed 770 million British pounds ($1.3 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;This incident has had a knock-on effect on the profits at NatWest Markets,&quot; NatWest said.</p>
<p>Banking analysts had expected a considerably better figure for the six months to the end of June, with one forecasting pre-tax profits in the region of 900 million ($1.47 billion) pounds before the warning.</p>
<p>NatWest made it clear the revision was entirely due to the problems at NatWest Markets. The bank is due to report its results for the first half of the year in August.</p>
<p>NatWest said an independent probe into what went wrong in its interest rate options business was nearing completion, adding an announcement on the report's main findings would be made by the end of June. This was originally due by the end of May.</p>
<p>The report, by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and law firm Linklaters &amp; Paines, has already been passed to the Bank of England and financial markets watchdog the Securities and Futures Authority, bankers said.</p>
