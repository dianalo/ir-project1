<headline>FORECAST-M&amp;S to ring up big profit rise.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-01</dateline>

<p>Britain's biggest clothing retailer Marks and Spencer Plc, which reports first half results next Tuesday, is set to cheer the retail sector with an estimated near 20 percent jump in profits.</p>
<p>Strong clothing sales will help boost first half pretax profits to between 420 million and 465 million stg from 387.1 million last year, analysts said. The dividend is forecast to rise to around 3.5 from 3.0 pence a share.  </p>
<p>Marks still makes most of its profits from Britain, but has expanded overseas with stores in France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Hong Kong and franchises in continental Europe and Asia. It also has outlets in Canada, plus Brooks Brothers and Kings Supermarkets in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;A recovery of clothing in the UK and Brooks Brothers producing a good performance will help the results,&quot; said one retail analyst. &quot;The Far East is doing well and (so are) financial services, but they will probably be restrained by Europe and Canada,&quot; he said. He recommended the shares as a hold.  </p>
<p>Analysts believe upbeat consumer confidence in Britain and a cool Autumn will have tempted shoppers to buy Marks Autumn/Winter ranges.</p>
<p>They expect clothing sales to have gathered momentum since July, when Marks reported a nine percent increase in non-food sales for the first quarter.</p>
<p>There are few worries on costs because of the group's well-known ability to keep a lid on expenditure, analysts said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717</p>
