<p>Dollar Eurobond issuance was set to continue unabated this week, with a handful of large dollar deals already in the pipeline on Monday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Toyota Motor Corp is due to launch a $1.0 billion five-year Euro-Asian bond via Credit Suisse First Boston and Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Spread talk for the triple-A rated deal was around 10 basis points over U.S. Treasury notes. The bonds will be listed in London, Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
<p>Also in the coming days, Argentina is due to issue a $750 million seven-year global bond, via CSFB and SBC Warburg. Bankers said spread talk ranged between 175 and 200 b.p. over U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>Argentina is rated B1 by Moody's and BB by Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
<p>Issuance of jumbo dollar bonds has surged in recent months on the back of a strong dollar and uncertainty about the single currency in Europe.</p>
<p>Last week, Canada issued a $1.0 billion five-year bond at eight b.p. over Treasuries, which was quoted at 8/7.5 over on Monday.</p>
<p>Also, Philip Morris launched a $1.0 billion eight-year bond at 78 b.p. over, where it was still trading. Philip Morris is rated A2 by Moody's and A by S&amp;P.</p>
