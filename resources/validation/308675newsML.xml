<p>Chinese soyoil buyers who have been selling cargoes back to the market are unlikely to unleash a flood of supplies originally destined for China, traders in the Far East said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>And soybeans and soybean meal have been flowing into the country, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;It's logical,&quot; a Hong Kong trader said of the Chinese sell-backs. &quot;It's not easy to sell in China and they immediately make a profit of US$10 a tonne that they definitely would not get in China.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. exporters told Reuters in Chicago on Tuesday that China had resold between 25,000 and 50,000 tonnes of Argentine soyoil to two trading houses in recent days.</p>
<p>Uncertainty over Chinese government plans for issuing import quotas for soyoil could be behind the sell-backs, traders in the Far East said.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect they are scared the quotas won't be issued,&quot; a source in Singapore said, adding that market sentiment had swung violently from bullish to bearish in a matter of days.</p>
<p>&quot;Buyers (in China) commit without downpayment, so you don't know what is going to happen about your money until the cargo arrives,&quot; another veteran China trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said little oil was actually on its way, and it was unlikely that washouts would become a feature of the market.</p>
<p>Soybeans and soybean meal were a different story, with trading sources reporting huge quantities of both commodities on the way to Chinese ports this month.</p>
<p>One trader in Singapore put the amount of soybean meal due to arrive in China this month at &quot;way, way above half a million tonnes... and closer to one million tonnes&quot;.</p>
<p>The meal was coming from India, the U.S., Brazil and Argentina, he said without elaborating.</p>
<p>Another trading house source chipped in with 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes of soybean meal due to land in China this month.</p>
<p>He also said 430,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans would be arriving at Chinese ports in January.</p>
<p>Domestic soybean meal prices had already begun to soften as the imports arrived, sources said.</p>
<p>One source quoted meal in the southern province of Guangdong, bordering Hong Kong, at 2,700 to 2,800 yuan (US$325-337) a tonne, down from closer to 3,000 yuan just weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;With so much (meal) arriving and discharging, the price has already been impacted,&quot; the Hong Kong trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;End-users are not very keen to talk about prices, they're going to buy on a hand-to-mouth basis because they're thinking if they buy now they have to pay cash and then pay storage.</p>
<p>&quot;So he'll push the seller to the wire to get as good a price as possible,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>China's premier annual Spring Festival vacation, this year beginning on February 6, is traditionally preceded by a few weeks of extremely slow business and extremely tight cash.</p>
<p>Importers of soybeans were more than likely to have secured deposits from their buyers and &quot;should be fairly safe,&quot; a Chinese source said.</p>
