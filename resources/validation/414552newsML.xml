<p>Finland's Oy Nokia Ab sees strong growth in the Latin American telecommunications market due to steady economic development and deregulation of the sector, a top official said Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Two important trends are coinciding in Latin America: solid and stable economic development and deregulation and liberalization of the telecomms market,&quot; Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, president of unit Nokia Inc and executive vice president of affiliate Nokia Americas, told Reuters.  </p>
<p>&quot;This obviously is a very interesting combination and will mean that the telecommunications sector will grow strongly in the years to come in Latin America.  Nokia is very interested in supporting this trend.&quot;  Kallasvuo was accompanying Finland's President Martti Ahtisaari on a visit to Argentina to promote trade between the two countries.</p>
<p>Nokia's operations in Latin America started at the beginning of the 1990s and the company, which is Europe's largest and the world's second largest mobile phone producer, now has sales offices in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, where it also has an assembly plant.  </p>
<p>In Brazil Nokia phones are produced under license by Gradiente Electronica SA.</p>
<p>Kallasvuo would not divulge whether the company has any specific investment plans but noted the Argentine market is important because of Nokia's position as the market leader in mobile handsets.</p>
<p>&quot;We are basically active in all the countries in the area,&quot; he said, adding that participation in the building of telecommunications infrastructure is increasing.  </p>
<p>In this sense, he said the introduction of new wireless telephone networks known as personal communications services (PCS) is an important development.</p>
<p>He said the operation and building of PCS networks is a &quot;very important new trend...as a part of the liberalization and deregulation process&quot; in Latin America.</p>
<p>Operating and building PCS networks &quot;is certaintly something that will give a boost to the market place in the years to come and will continue to mean that this market will be very interesting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>PCS systems are seen as the second generation of mobile phone networks using digital technology rather than the widespread cellular networks based on older analog technology.</p>
<p>&quot;We look very positively at Latin American all in all and we are certainly committed to this market and increasingly supporting its development,&quot; Kallasvuo said.</p>
