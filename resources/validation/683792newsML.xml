<p>President Bill Clinton will set 50-year goals for reducing global warming when he addresses the U.N. Earth Summit later this week, Under Secretary of State Tim Wirth said on  Tuesday.</p>
<p>With the United States under pressure, especially from Europe, to set clear short-term targets for cutting pollution from fossil fuels, Wirth sought to shift the focus to the longer term.</p>
<p>&quot;He's going to say what he thinks the long-term goal should be,&quot; Wirth said at a briefing, adding he meant stabilising levels of greenhouse gases over the next 30 to 50 years.</p>
<p>&quot;If people don't understand the issue of long-term concentrations, and then aren't willing to make a commitment to long term concentrations, we're not going ot make any progress whatsoever,&quot; Wirth said.</p>
<p>Clinton, who addresses the Earth Summit on Thursday, will discuss the &quot;enormously challenging long-term solutions&quot; involving &quot;a whole new approach to how the world fuels its economy,&quot; Wirth said.</p>
<p>The United States rejected European pressure at a Group of Seven summit of industrialised nations in Denver last weekend to set short term goals for cutting greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>Negotiations on the issue culminate in a climate conference in Kyoto, Japan in December.</p>
<p>But Wirth downplayed the current talks and said the United States will not announce its targets and timetables for emissions reductions until late summer or early fall.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever we do in Kyoto doesn't solve the problem. It is a step toward the...very sharp reductions that are going to be necessary if we are going to stabilise the concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>To stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations at twice their pre-industrial concentrations by 2050 would require a 70 percent reduction in in emissions &quot;by all carbon producing countries, us in particular,&quot; Wirth said.</p>
<p>The United States is the largest single source of carbon dioxide pollution.</p>
<p>Wirth said ways to reduce pollution without hurting the economy could involve complex tradeoffs of fuel taxes offset by reductions in other taxes.</p>
