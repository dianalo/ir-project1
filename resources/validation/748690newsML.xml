<p>African leaders are pushing their case at high-level African-American talks in Zimbabwe for increased U.S. investment in the world's poorest continent.</p>
<p>The leaders, who include Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, Botswana's Ketumile Masire and Senegal's Abdou Diouf, are to meet top business executives from some of the Fortune 500 companies on Thursday to discuss investment opportunities in Africa.</p>
<p>In a plenary session, the African leaders are expected to outline in greater detail the specific areas in which they want to see more investment.</p>
<p>Several of the chief executives, whose delegation is led by U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, have indicated that they would be increasing their investments as Africa was slowly becoming ripe for business.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the prospects for growth are excellent in Africa. We are encouraged by the stabilisation we see being achieved and we are encouraged by the new environment for business that we see developing,&quot; Glen Hiner, chairman and CEO of glass fibre company Owens Corning, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The president of soft drinks giant Coca-Cola said Africa was engaged in political and economic reforms attractive to foreign investment, particularly in relaxing foreign exchange controls and providing incentives to promote private industry.</p>
<p>He told Reuters that the corporation was looking to double its business on the continent in the next five years through aggressive investments.</p>
<p>At the meeting's official opening on Wednesday, Mugabe and Organisation of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim stressed that African was serious in moving towards democracy and economic reform.</p>
<p>&quot;The time is over for the soldier-come-soldier-go system of government,&quot; Mugabe told the 1,000 delegates. &quot;We are therefore resolute in our determination to see the blossoming of sustainable democratic systems of governance on the continent.&quot;</p>
<p>Mugabe's government has banned public protests to stop Zimbabwe war veterans from disrupting the meeting by demonstrating for pension payouts.</p>
<p>The war veterans' association decided late on Wednesday to suspend demonstrations to give the government time to meet their demands.</p>
