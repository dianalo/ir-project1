<title>INDONESIA: Jakarta shares end higher on big-caps.</title>
<headline>Jakarta shares end higher on big-caps.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1996-10-23</dateline>

<p>Jakarta shares ended higher on Wednesday on the back of active buying of some heavyweight stocks and secondaries despite a late wave of profit-taking in automobile manufacturer Astra International, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Composite Index rose 3.60 points, or 0.63 percent, to close at 575.40 points after reaching 576.44 points in early trade. Gainers led losers by 57 to 50, with 59 unchanged.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was likely to continue being active on Thursday with the listing of fishery firm PT Daya Guna Samudra seen buoying sentiment and possible rises in Astra.  </p>
<p>Daya Guna Samudra will float 100 million shares issued at a price of 1,950 rupiah.</p>
<p>Brokers said sharp rises in Astra International and tobacco firms Sampoerna and Gudang Garam in the morning had helped sentiment despite relatively slow trading.</p>
<p>&quot;But there was better market sentiment and more active trading in the later session,&quot; a local broker said.</p>
<p>Astra topped the active list with 9.4 million shares changing hands on the local board but closed unchanged at 4,250 rupiah after soaring to 4,600 in early trade.  </p>
<p>Astra rose sharply in early trade on excellent nine-month results and a raised company forecast of net profit for 1996, brokers said.</p>
<p>But the market grew nervous following State Secretary Murdiono's comments that the government wanted to see that the company remained widely-held with no single group or person gaining control, they said.</p>
<p>One foreign broker said a block deal of some 30 million Astra foreign shares at a price of 4,000 rupiah just before closing also added to the nervousness.  </p>
<p>Medco Energy, involved in oil and gas exploration and services, was actively traded with 6.3 million shares changing hands, rising 9.43 percent to 2,900 rupiah.</p>
<p>Brokers said it was due to market talk that the firm had signed an agreement with a London-based firm.</p>
<p>Company officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>Bakrie Brothers was also actively traded following news that its motorcycle unit had signed an agremeent with a Singapore firm. It rose 325 rupiah to 3,575 rupiah on a turnover of 4.1 million shares.  </p>
<p>Cigarette maker Sampoerna rose 5.31 percent to 21,825 rupiah on a volume of 813,500 shares on what brokers said was positive reaction to a company announcement that it would sell its 2.85 percent stake in Astra International.</p>
