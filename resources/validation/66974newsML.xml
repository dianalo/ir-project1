<p>Colombia's Congress elected diplomat Carlos Lemos Simmonds as the country's new vice president on Thursday amid continuing calls for embattled President Ernesto Samper to step down.</p>
<p>The extraordinary election by both houses of Congress, which is dominated by Samper's Liberal Party, was scheduled after former Vice President Humberto de la Calle resigned last week, citing Samper's alleged ties to drug kingpins and what he described as the government's deepening credibility crisis.</p>
<p>Samper, who shrugged off De la Calle's demand that he resign also, has been widely applauded in the aftermath of the new blow to his prestige for tapping Lemos, ambassador to Britain and widely respected as a tough, honest politician, to fill the post.</p>
<p>But the leader of the opposition Conservative Party said Lemos' election would fail to pull together a country torn by political crisis and growing lawlessness.</p>
<p>&quot;From the outset we said Samper and De la Calle's election was invalid because of the huge funds from drug trafficking that were poured into their campaign,&quot; Sen. Jaime Arias said. &quot;Lemos' election is an agreement by Liberal currents to solve internal disagreements but cannot be seen as a step toward national reconciliation.&quot;</p>
<p>Claudia Blum, legislator for the New Democratic Force, whose candidate lost to Samper in 1994, pressed the president to resign &quot;in the shortest time possible&quot; and allow Lemos to lead Colombia out of its prolonged political crisis.</p>
<p>Political analysts say rumours are beginning to circulate that Lemos, who accepted Samper's nomination with a pledge of loyalty, has already struck a deal that will see the president handing over the full reins of power.</p>
<p>Samper, who was cleared of any wrongdoing in connection with his campaign in a congressional trial in June, has insisted repeatedly that he will see out his full term of office.</p>
<p>Even in his largely ceremonial role as vice president, which will be conducted for the time being from London in tandem with his diplomatic posting, Lemos is tipped by political analysts to bridge the divide between warring factions of his own Liberal Party.</p>
<p>That in-fighting has been fuelled by the accusations that Samper knew the Cali drug cartel pumped millions of dollars of cocaine cash into his 1994 campaign and exacerbated by a three-week-old spiral in leftist guerrilla violence.</p>
<p>The post of vice president, created in a package of constitutional reforms in 1991, is ill-defined and confers few specific responsibilities except that of replacing the president should he not fulfil his four-year term.</p>
