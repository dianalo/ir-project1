<p>Asian dollar deposit rates were quietly steady in lacklustre trade, dealers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said most traders were sidelined ahead of the second leg of the U.S. Treasury's quarterly refunding package.</p>
<p>The treasury will offer the market US$39.75 billion at its refunding auction package this week. The sale will be made up of $17.75 billion in three-year notes on Tuesday, $12.0 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday and $10.0 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates were steady to higher in the morning on some position adjustments,&quot; a local dealer said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market was traded with narrow ranges today amid uncertainty over the outcome of demand for tonight's 10-year note sale, despite fairly good response to Tuesday's three-year note sale,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In day-to-day rates, Wednesday/Thursday and Thursday/Friday rose 1/16 percentage point each to a common 5-7/16 5-5/16 percent. Week-fixed was unchanged from Tuesday's 5-3/8 5-1/4 percent. Among longer dates, two-months was unchanged from Tuesday's 5-7/16 5-5/16 percent, four-months unchanged at 5-1/2 5-3/8, six-months unchanged at 5-9/16 5-7/16 and twelve-months unchanged at 5-13/16 5-11/16 percent. - P.Theseira (65-870-3085)</p>
