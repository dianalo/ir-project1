<p>An official Syrian newspaper on Monday told U.S. secretary of state-designate Madeleine Albright not to appease Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Mohammed Khair al-Wadi, Director-General of the official daily Tishreen said Albright would not find problems in dealing with Syria if she worked for a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East based on trading land for peace.</p>
<p>&quot;Appeasing the government of Netanyahu will undermine what has remained of the peace process. It will encourage this government to commit more foolish actions and aggressive adventures, and will plunge the region into a cycle of violence, terrorism and terrible wars,&quot; Wadi said.</p>
<p>His comment is the first Syrian reaction on the nomination of Albright and other members of the U.S. National Security team announced by President Bill Clinton on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a front-page comment Wadi scorned Netanyahu for phoning Clinton's nominees, saying the Israeli premier wanted &quot;to show the new changes would lead to dramatic adjustments in the U.S. policy and efforts which America might exert to activate the peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;In an unusual move, Netanyahu was quick to phone personally the new faces in the American adminstration to congratulate them. The aim of this quick and acrobatic move is to cover up his anti-peace position,&quot; Wadi said.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who ends his four-year term in January, paid numerous visits to Syria and Israel during the last four years but no breakthrough was achieved in Damascus's peace talks with Tel Aviv which opened in Madrid in 1991.</p>
<p>The talks were stalled over the fate of the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Damascus wants full a Israeli pullback from the strategic plateau.</p>
<p>Syria strongly condemned Netanyahu for refusing to swap the occupied Arab lands for peace and no talks were held with his government since he took office in June.</p>
<p>&quot;The new persons in the American adminstration will find no problem with Syria or Arabs if they want to reactivate the peace process within the basis on which it was based in Madrid...&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Tishreen director-general said U.S. efforts to reactivate the stalled Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations would be fruitless if no pressure was put on the Israeli government.</p>
<p>&quot;U.S. efforts will not advance even an inch if Netanyahu's government was not forced to accept the spirit of the U.S. peace initiative,&quot; Wadi said.</p>
<p>He concluded by saying: &quot;Syria welcomes every constructive effort by the U.S. adminstration to build a real peace that would end aggression and take the region into a new era of stability and prosperity.&quot;</p>
