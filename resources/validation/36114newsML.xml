<p>The foreign exchange market continued to force the Bank of France's hand on Thursday with sustained franc selling, but the central bank set about defending the franc's old ERM floor of 3.4305 per mark with gusto.</p>
<p>Another round of intervention on Thursday followed a push to within a whisker of the old lower limit on the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), with the franc sagging after a strong set of second-quarter German growth data.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically the BoF's policy is to cross their fingers and wait,&quot; said one Paris dealer. &quot;It's the Micawber policy...you just hope the future will provide.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said this round of intervention was far more public that previously, as if the Bank of France wanted to advertise its actions.</p>
<p>&quot;We were being asked in Singapore in some quite chunky amounts by French banks who don't normally deal,&quot; said one trader. &quot;Spraying it around in Asia is a bit of a giveaway, they wanted it to be visible. They are there and there is size.&quot;</p>
<p>With over $25 billion in foreign exchange reserves the Bank of France has plenty of ammunition, but traders pointed out that in 1992 the Bank of England spent over $40 billion on what was eventually unsuccessful intervention.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't run away the first time the Bank of France says it's got a stick behind its back,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The Bank of France's shadowing of the old ERM limits would seem to confirm what the market has been thinking for some time.</p>
<p>&quot;It is consistent with the belief that agreement was reached at the Verona EU summit in April to shadow narrower bands in the two year period prior to EMU, to fulfill the strict interpretation of the Maastricht exchange rate criteria,&quot; said Joe Prendergast, Foreign Exchange Strategist at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>European economic and monetary union (EMU) is due to be launched in 1999 but EU countries intending to take part must fulfill economic conditions in 1997 to join.</p>
<p>If the market pressure continues beyond the French budget on September 18, Prendergast said broader policy options may have to be considered like permitting the perceived fuzzy bands within the formal 15 percent bands to get fuzzier, and allow mark/Paris to spend some time above 3.4305.</p>
<p>This would be done in the belief that Franco-German political commitment to EMU and &quot;correct&quot; domestic policies would secure exchange rate stability in the medium term.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, there is little the Bank of France can do but continue to intervene and hope something turns up.</p>
<p>A much improved set of French economic statistics would help but can effectively be ruled out, as can surprise weakness in German data.</p>
<p>In the background is the possibility that a much stronger dollar would take the pressure of mark/franc but the dollar looks unlikely to firm of its own accord.</p>
<p>&quot;Given that you can rule out most of the alternatives you have to look at the likelihood of concerted central bank intervention on dollar/mark,&quot; said Nick Parsons, forex strategist at Banque Paribas in Paris.</p>
<p>This would include the Bundesbank and send a clear signal to the market about the commitment to European monetary union (EMU) and that the intervention was designed to ease EMS tensions.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got 845 days to a single currency, time is running out and they need something to turn up fairly quickly,&quot; Parsons said. &quot;Intervention would buy them time and time is the one commodity that is not in their favour and they can't control.&quot;</p>
