<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates closed down 58 basis points at 21.15 percent on Wednesday, substantially below the session average of 22 percent, due to a late surge in demand from dealers who rushed to close positions, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders pointed out that for most of the session, overnight rates actually trended upwards, and reached highs of 22.70 percent, in response to pressure on the peso in the foreign exchnage market. In a similar move, term rates on government paper closed up.</p>
<p>&quot;We felt the floor rate for the 28-day paper was 23 percent, but the fall in real returns following the latest primary falls is excessive and is discouraging investment in peso-denominated paper,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico assigned bellwether 28-day Cetes at 22.74 percent at Tuesday evening's primary auction.</p>
<p>&quot;A sign of this is that the peso weakened in the foreign exchange market and that term instruments were in supply today,&quot; the trader added.</p>
<p>In the term market, 28-day and 91-day Cetes both rose 25 basis points, to 23.00 and 25.25 percent, respectively, compared to current primary rates of 22.74 and 25.11 percent.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso closed 4.1 centavos weaker at 7.5850/7.5890.</p>
<p>Money market analysts and traders expected primary rates to rise next week, due to recent pressure on the peso and uncertainty ahead of the renewal of the Alliance for Economic Recovery (ARE), a package of economic measures agreed between the giovernment and labor and business leaders.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile closed up 85 basis points at 24.30 percent.</p>
<p>Total credit maturities for Thursday were estimated at 2.002 billion pesos, but traders pointed out that consequent liquidity shortages would be increased by an oversupply of 1.179 billion pesos carried over from the primary auction.</p>
