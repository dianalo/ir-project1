<p>The New Jersey agency in charge of new hospital bond issues has given tentative approval to four hospital systems in the state that want to sell a total of $71 million of negotiated bond deals.</p>
<p>Steve Fillebrown, deputy director at the New Jersey Health Care Facilities Financing Authority, said the largest issue is a $44 million deal proposed by the Kennedy Health System.</p>
<p>Kennedy, a four-hospital system, is hoping to sell about $34 million in a forward refunding and about $10 million of new money in a bond sale later this year, Fillebrown said.</p>
<p>New Jersey regulations require bond deals to be sold by competitive bid whenever possible, but the agency told Kennedy and three other systems to proceed with plans for negotiated deals because of special factors.</p>
<p>The forward component of Kennedy's deal qualifies it for negotiated sale.</p>
<p>The agency's move is not a formal approval of the bond sale, which must come at a future board meeting. It only authorizes the facilities to secure investment bankers for their proposals and to take other actions necessary to get the deals underway on a negotiated basis.</p>
<p>Also approved for a possible negotiated bond sale was Bayonne Hospital, which proposed selling $10 million of bonds later this year.</p>
<p>Bayonne is in affiliation talks with Christ Hospital in Hudson County and Palisades General Hospital in West New York. Those talks complicate Bayonne's credit picture, which warrants the special attention a negotiated offering provides, Fillebrown said.</p>
<p>The agency also advanced a plan by Christian Health Center in Wyckoff to sell $9 million. That deal qualified for an exception to the competitive bid rule in part because it may include variable-rate debt.</p>
<p>Southern Ocean County Hospital in Manahawkin won authorization to use the negotiated route for between $7 million and $8 million of negotiated bonds later this year. If given final approval, the bonds would be used to build a maternity unit and for other capital projects.</p>
<p>The hospital qualified for a negotiated sale because the sale may include a taxable component, and the facility is small and not as well-known in the market as other hospitals, Fillibrown said.</p>
