<p>Britain will present a progress report to the farm Council on Monday on steps taken to curb mad cow disease but will not seek to exempt certified disease-free herds from a global export ban, EU officials said.</p>
<p>Under a deal struck at the Florence European Council in June, Britain agreed to slaughter more cattle at risk of developing the fatal brain disease and to tighten controls on feed and animal movements in return for a phased lifting of the ban.</p>
<p>The EU imposed the ban in March after Britain disclosed a possible link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and its fatal human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), triggering a sharp drop in beef sales.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't expect any British request or proposal,&quot; one EU source said.</p>
<p>British officials confirmed that no move to exempt certified BSE-free herds would be made next week. &quot;There's no working document,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>A Commission spokesman said the issue was being discussed but Britain had not made a specific demand on certified herds.</p>
<p>Irish farm minister Ivan Yates, whose country holds the EU presidency, said last month that a majority of EU member states were sypathetic to a certified herd scheme in Northern Ireland, where there is a computerised system for tracing animals.</p>
<p>But he stressed it was up to London to make a move.</p>
<p>British officials said the government was waiting for the advice of EU veterinary scientists on whether a selective cull of up to 147,000 extra cattle was necessary.</p>
<p>The cull, which would supplement the annual slaughter of one million animals over the age of 30 months, was part of the Florence summit deal.</p>
<p>British officials said nearly 900,000 animals have been killed and the backlog in the programme would be cleared by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler, backed by member states, has insisted that Britain carry out the extra cull before the ban can be eased.</p>
<p>The scientists, who had been expected to advise on the cull by mid-November, are now only expected to do so early next year.</p>
<p>Farm ministers are also due on Monday to adopt measures to implement an agreement last month to cut beef output in line with a sharp drop in sales due to the BSE health scare as well as an extra 500 million Ecus aid for farmers.</p>
<p>But France, the main benificiary, is pressing the European Commission to speed up proposals on how this aid would be found.</p>
<p>Proposals for beef labelling and cattle passports will be discussed but a decision is only possible in December after the European Parliament has given an opinion.</p>
