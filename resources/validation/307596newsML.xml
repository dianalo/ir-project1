<p>Iran is expected to earn $18 billion in oil revenue in the next Iranian year, starting March 21, Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh was quoted on Tuesday as saying.</p>
<p>Aghazadeh told the English-language Iran News newspaper that estimated earnings were based on a budget price of $17.50 a barrel from the sale of 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and additional exports of refined products.</p>
<p>Oil is Iran's largest single earner, contributing 41 percent to state budgeted revenue.</p>
<p>He also stressed the importance of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and issued an indirect warning to producers outside the group.</p>
<p>&quot;OPEC is an important organisation to establish oil prices and the absence of this organisation would create disorder in the world oil market,&quot; he told Iran News. &quot;If OPEC saturates the market with its surplus, oil prices would fall sharply. And therefore we expect all non-OPEC members to recognise this fact and also realise that OPEC members will not continue their sacrifice indefinitely.&quot;</p>
<p>The minister said U.S. sanctions targeted against Iran's oil industry had been unsuccessful with Tehran being able to find markets for oil previously lifted by American firms and that Iran was manufacturing equipment.</p>
<p>&quot;Iran has many long-term agreements with foreign companies and therefore we have been very successful in our endeavours,&quot; Aghazadeh said.</p>
<p>&quot;With the diligent activities of Iran's various industries we have tried to manufacture our own parts domestically. And in line with this policy we have saved $200 million in the past two years.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton imposed a unilateral but sweeping trade and investment ban against Iran in 1995 for Iran's alleged sponsorship of international terrorism and its nuclear weapons programme. Iran denies the charges.</p>
