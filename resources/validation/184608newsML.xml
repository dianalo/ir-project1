<p>Sumitomo Metal Mining Co is considering acquiring part of Sumitomo Corp's minority stake in the $1.6 billion Batu Hijau gold and copper mining project in Indonesia, a company spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He denied a Japanese media report this morning, however, that the two companies had already agreed that Sumitomo Metal would take a share of several percent in the project.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, Sumitomo Corp has been talking to us for some time (about taking a stake in the project),&quot; he said. &quot;But it is not true that we have reached agreement.&quot;  </p>
<p>He said he expected that any Sumitomo Metal stake in the huge project, if agreed to, would be small in percentage terms.</p>
<p>He added the company would base any decision on Batu Hijau solely on business considerations and not on the financial state of Sumitomo Corp, the trade house of the Sumitomo group that earlier this year announced an estimated $2.6 billion in losses from alleged unauthorised copper trades.</p>
<p>&quot;This is strictly a mining business matter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also noted that Sumitomo Metal and Sumitomo Corp already jointly own minority stakes in Phelps Dodge Corp's Morenci mine in Arizona and Candelaria mine in Chile.  </p>
<p>Those Phelps Dodge mines combined produce more than half a million tonnes of copper per year.</p>
<p>Sumitomo Corp and U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corp reached an agreement earlier this year to develop Batu Hijau, which has estimated reserves of about five million tonnes of copper and 14.7 million ounces of gold.</p>
<p>Newmont holds a 45 percent stake and Sumitomo Corp 35 percent, with the rest in the hands of an Indonesian partner.</p>
<p>Construction of the project, estimated to cost $1.6 billion, is expected to begin next year with production scheduled to start in 2000.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have expertise in mine development, so of course we are prepared to be able to help in that regard if requested, but everything is still under review,&quot; the Sumitomo Metal spokesman said.</p>
<p>One concern for his company, he said, was the sharp drop in copper prices this summer after Sumitomo Corp announced its massive copper trading losses.</p>
<p>&quot;The copper price has fallen,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;This is of course an issue.&quot;</p>
<p>The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported this morning that Sumitomo Metal had agreed to buy a several percent share in Batu Hijau from Sumitomo Corp.</p>
<p>It also stated that one reason Sumitomo Metal had decided to assist Sumitomo Corp in the project was to preserve the credibility of the Sumitomo group in the wake of Sumitomo Corp's copper market losses.</p>
