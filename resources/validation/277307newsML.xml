<p>An expected rise in foreign demand propelled share prices sharply higher on Thursday at the National and Calcutta bourses, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said anticipated fresh allocations by foreign funds in early January triggered speculative buying.</p>
<p>&quot;The rally was due to anticipated demand,&quot; said Salil Ramesh Chandra at Rolta Share and Stock Brokers. &quot;The action was also aided by the holiday at the BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange).&quot;</p>
<p>He said firming prices in the global depositary receipts of Indian stocks listed overseas was another factor that sparked the rally at home.  </p>
<p>The 50-share NSE index finished 27.75 points, or 3.14 percent, higher at 911.80 after hitting 913.35.</p>
<p>Dealers said speculative buying was heavy at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) because the Bombay bourse was closed for Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a trader's market,&quot; said Mehul Patel at brokerage Mukesh Babu Securities Ltd. &quot;There were few retail investors or mutual funds.&quot;</p>
<p>The net traded value was 7.84 billion rupees in 38.31 million shares at the NSE.  </p>
<p>Patel said the state-owned Unit Trust of India, the country's biggest mutual fund, sold at higher levels.</p>
<p>Automobile shares firmed on November production and sales figures. Sales of trucks rose to 22,838 units in November from 22,661 in October and of cars to 29,027 from 27,707, the Association of Indian Automobile Manufacturers said.</p>
<p>But two-wheeler sales were down to 241,809 units in November from 243,970 in October, it said. TELCO rose 15 rupees to 348, Bajaj Auto 37.65 to 906.15 and M&amp;M 9.50 to 337.50.</p>
<p>SBI firmed 9.65 rupees to 235.60, ITC 7.95 to 331.95, Reliance 7.65 to 208.65, L&amp;T 8.40 to 225 and BSES 10 to 218.50.</p>
