<p>U.S. computer network communications company Fore Systems expects revenue from Asia to double in its current fiscal year, a company official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking at doubling revenue (from Asia) this year,&quot; Magdelene Wong, Fore's area manager for Singapore, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>She said Asia operations contributed about 20 to 25 percent of worldwide sales.  </p>
<p>For the financial year ended March 31, 1997, Fore recorded a revenue of US$395.3 million.</p>
<p>Wong said Asia had continued to chalk up higher revenue in the first quarter of the year despite a difficult period for the company worldwide.</p>
<p>Fore's revenue in the first quarter had increased to $95.4 million compared to $83.4 million previously, but net profit fell to about $5 million from $11.4 million.</p>
<p>Wong said Fore was aggressively promoting its Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology for networks in Asia this year and would be having roadshows in the region every quarter.  </p>
<p>It is also holding industry-specific seminars to help businesses understand the benefits of ATM technology.</p>
<p>In Singapore, Fore was riding on the city-state's island-wide high bandwidth multimedia network called Singapore ONE.</p>
<p>&quot;We foresee a lot of the business from Singapore will be based on Singapore ONE,&quot; Wong said.</p>
<p>She saw the number of companies, either content providers or companies providing access to the Singapore network, doubling in 1998 compared to 1997.  </p>
<p>Besides Singapore, Fore sees South Korea and China as strong markets for its products.</p>
<p>Wong said Fore had been reducing the cost of using ATM technology to the extent that it was now equivalent to the cost of using the more traditional Fast Ethernet technology.</p>
