<p>Sri Lanka's struggling tourist industry has started to take off after witnessing a 25 percent drop in arrivals in 1996, government and industry officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;January and February recorded a 15 percent increase in tourist traffic and according to the reservations, the rest of the season looks just as good,&quot; H.M.S. Samaranayake, chairman of the Ceylon Tourist Board, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There is definitely a recovery,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Industry officials said the recovery had been fuelled by the absence of Tamil rebel violence in the capital Colombo, which has been placed under tight security since the separatist group blew up the Central Bank in January 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;All this industry needs is peace, at least in most parts of the country, if not the whole country,&quot; said Dirk Flamer-Caldera, a director of Connaissance de Ceylan, one of the Sri Lanka's main inbound tour operators.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that there haven't been bombs going off in the capital has fuelled this revival. Actually, we can't keep up with the inquiries.&quot;</p>
<p>Tourism earnings plummeted to $175 million in 1996 from $225 million the previous year, reducing Sri Lanka to a low-budget destination and drawing to a halt new investment in the industry.</p>
<p>&quot;As arrivals dropped, hotels began to undercut each other for the existing business,&quot; said Nihal Perera, general manager of the 94-year-old Hotel Suisse in the central hills of Kandy, 120 km (72 miles) east of Colombo.</p>
<p>&quot;We are selling what is essentially an $85 room for $40 and less,&quot; Perera told Reuters.</p>
<p>Tourist arrivals began to fall in late 1995, soon after the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) blew up Colombo's main oil depot in October, Samaranayake said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank bombing, which killed 100 people and levelled part of Colombo's financial district, badly hit whatever was left of the 1995/96 winter season, he said. No tourists were hurt in the blast.</p>
<p>Then in July, just when foreign tourists began booking their 96/97 winter vacations, the rebels exploded bombs in a crowded train in a Colombo suburb, killing some 100 passengers.</p>
<p>The LTTE are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in predominantly Sinhalese Sri Lanka. The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed since the war began in 1983.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the train bombing, there have been no incidents in the city. That has set the stage for the current recovery,&quot; Samaranayake said.</p>
<p>He said the tourist board planned to drum up some positive publicity in an attempt to change the international travelling public's perception of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, their perception is that Sri Lanka is a country at war. That is not true,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the fighting was contained in the north and east and away from tourist attractions such as the southern beaches, the central hill country and the ancient kingdom sites in the northcentral region.</p>
<p>Those who have dared to visit the island seem to have no regrets.</p>
<p>&quot;The tight security all over reminds us of the war, but at the same time it is comforting,&quot; said German tourist Cornelia Hanner. &quot;I think it is a brilliant place to visit.&quot;</p>
