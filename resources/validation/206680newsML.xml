<title>USA: Philadelphia pension fund to sell Texaco stock.</title>
<headline>Philadelphia pension fund to sell Texaco stock.</headline>
<dateline>PHILADELPHIA</dateline>
<text>
<p>The board of Philadelphia's pension funds voted to divest $5.5 million worth of Texaco Inc. stock, citing tapes of alleged racial slurs by executives at the nation's third-largest oil company.</p>
<p>&quot;People are very offended as to what was revealed on the Texaco tapes and we don't want to be part of that corporate culture,&quot; pension board Chairman Ben Hayllar said at the board's meeting.</p>
<p>The move comes a week after the Philadelphia City Council voted in a non-binding resolution to boycott Texaco and divest itself of all holdings in the oil company.</p>
<p>Pension board member Charles Johnson said the sale of the stock should send a message to other companies. &quot;People are not to be taken for granted, especially minorities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The board is to review the move after a year to see if the oil company has made progress in minority hiring and promotions. It would then consider purchasing Texaco stock again.</p>
<p>Texaco last week reached a $176 million settlement of a 1994 lawsuit brought by a group of black employees accusing the company of systematically discriminating against blacks and denying them promotions. It was the biggest settlement of a discrimination case in the United States.</p>
<p>A former Texaco executive was charged on Tuesday with obstructing justice by destroying documents sought in the racial discrimination case.</p>
<p>White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco, meanwhile, faces an ongoing consumer boycott due to the allegations of discrimination.</p>
<p>Texaco's stock lost 37.5 cents to $99.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
