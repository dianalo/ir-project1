<p>Mafia families in the Northeast United States are shifting increasingly to white collar crime, The New York Times quoting law enforcement officials reported Monday.</p>
<p>It said the new Mafia focus was mainly in the areas of health insurance, prepaid telephone cards, an industry that grosses about $1 billion a year, and small Wall Street brokerage houses.</p>
<p>&quot;They are analagous to companies in Chapter 11 bankruptcy,&quot; Lewis Schiliro, chief of the FBI's criminal division in New York, told the paper. &quot;They are still in business but many of their old moneymaking bases have dried up and they are moving into new industries to fill the void.&quot;</p>
<p>The paper said federal and local law officials were investigating efforts by the Genovese, Gambino and Colombo crime families to coordinate frauds through initial public offerings in the over-the-counter market handled by small brokerage firms.</p>
<p>A Long Island businessman who asked not to be identified told the paper that mobsters offer loans to brokers, forcing them in exchange to sell low-priced shares of a company before its stock is offered to the public.</p>
<p>The report also said 12 men accused of being members of the Genovese family were arrested in August after setting up a New Jersey company that investigators said was used to extract excessive payments from health plan administrators.</p>
