<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The partial indicators of GDP this week should give the markets a fair idea of what to expect for next Wednesday, and Friday's data will give an indication of whether the early strength in retail spending this year has carried into the second quarter.</p>
<p>CAPEX - Private new capital expenditure is expected to have posted a March quarter rise after the fall in December but more important will be the second estimate for spending in 1997/98. With the help of three rate cuts in the second half of last year, and strong growth expected, conditions are seen favourable for investment, which is expected to remain a key driver of growth.</p>
<p>STOCKS/INVENTORIES - A detraction from first quarter growth is expected as the pace of the stocks increase slows. A strong first quarter in the retail sector may have helped unwind some built up stocks, and the early signs of a housing recovery may also have helped make inroads into some manufacturing stocks.</p>
<p>BALANCE OF GOODS AND SERVICES - A rebound in exports after a weak performance in March is expected to push the balance back into surplus. Markets are still adjusting to this figure, and economists said abstracting from the volatility the balance is probably running in surplus, but with pressure from the import side building as 1997 progresses.</p>
<p>BALANCE OF PAYMENTS - The first quarterly current account deficit data since the scrapping of monthly data is expected to show a deficit of A$4.5 to A$5.0 billion -- or roughly A$1.5 to A$1.7 billion a month. This is a improvement on the December quarter and economists said given that the monthly trade balance showed a A$137 million surplus over the first quarter, it will help reinforce the underlying net debt problem Australia faces. After being a detraction in the December quarter, net exports are expected to make a small positive contribution to GDP.</p>
<p>RETAIL TRADE/MOTOR REGISTRATIONS - The data will give an idea of how retail spending has held up into the second quarter, and will be especially interesting in light of the RBA's rate cut on Friday. Retail spending began the year very strongly, but has since showed some signs of softening. The fact the Easter period fell totally in March may also be a risk that the April data may be weak, economists said. After three strong monthly rises, economists expect registrations to be flat but said the trend would still be quite strongly positive.</p>
