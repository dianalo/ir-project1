<p>Taiwan reiterated on Tuesday that it can never accept reunion with China under the local autonomy scheme being pioneered in Beijing-ruled Hong Kong and promoted by China's communist leaders for the estranged island.</p>
<p>&quot;The Republic of China government (on Taiwan) will never accept such a formula,&quot; government spokesman David Lee said after mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin hailed the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; concept as a model for Taiwan.  </p>
<p>Taipei has consistently rejected the scheme, saying the Republic of China has never lost sovereignty despite losing a civil war to the communists in 1949 and fleeing to Taiwan, that it can still defend itself and has 30 diplomatic alliances.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides, we are a democratic country. Any actions taken by us must be based on public opinion and I don't think the public will ever agree to accept such a formula,&quot; Lee added.</p>
<p>Jiang and Premier Li Peng, in speeches in Hong Kong and Beijing, hailed Beijing's pledge that Hong Kong could keep its capitalist system under communist sovereignty as a model for Taiwan's eventual &quot;reunification with the motherland&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The 'one country, two systems' formula works for Hong Kong and Macau,&quot; Li told a reception in Beijing. &quot;It can also work for Taiwan.&quot;</p>
<p>Taiwan Vice President Lien Chan, speaking minutes after Hong Kong's midnight handover, said Taiwan could never accept rule by communists. Reunification was possible only if all China, like Taiwan itself, adopts multiparty democracy -- a scheme Lien dubbed &quot;one country, one good system&quot;.</p>
