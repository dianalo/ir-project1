<p>The following stories appeared in Monday's Daily Variety:</p>
<p>* Columbia's jungle thriller &quot;Anaconda&quot; rose to the top of the weekend box office chart with a $16.5 million studio-estimated debut and Universal's &quot;Liar Liar&quot; dropped to second place.</p>
<p>* Castle Rock Entertainment will lay off more than half its employees over the next few weeks, or as many as 80 jobs, the company said. Cuts are seen in departments that overlap with Warner Bros., now Castle Rock's parent studio.</p>
<p>* Live Entertainment reported a $3.4 million loss in 1996 after a $7.1 million reserve for back taxes and confirmed it had been approached about the possible sale of the entire company.</p>
<p>* Networks are deciding which new shows they will run. The dilemma for networks is whether to bring back a show that has yet to distinguish itself or to risk trying something new.</p>
<p>* Imagine Television, the new TV arm of Brian Grazer and Ron Howard's Imagine Entertainment, has tapped veteran Creative Artists Agency agent Tony Krantz as a partner and CEO of the startup.</p>
