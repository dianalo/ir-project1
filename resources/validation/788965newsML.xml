<title>USA: Stocks slide on weaker bond market.</title>
<headline>Stocks slide on weaker bond market.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Stocks fell for the second straight day Friday, pressured by weakness in the bond market and profit-taking after a rally earlier in the week.</p>
<p>At midmorning, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 64.11 at 8,123.89. In the broader market, losing issues beat gainers by a 4-1 margin on volume of about 156 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, the Dow traded as low as 8,080.92, a decline of 107.08.</p>
<p>&quot;The market took 100 points so fast we hardly had time to look at it, but this was obviously a little extreme,&quot; said Alfred Kugel, Stein Roe &amp; Farnham senior investment strategist.</p>
<p>&quot;The weakness in the bond market is hurting stocks but stock market fundamentals really haven't changed that much,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>High-tech issues also were under pressure, with the tech-laden Nasdaq down 11.75 points at 1,612.43</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Dow industrials slid 71 points to finish at 8,188, posting losses as bond prices fell. Analysts said a rise in the yield on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond to above 6.50 percent gave investors a reason to sell.</p>
<p>Bonds and stocks saw selling pressure on Thursday after a mixed market reaction to the U.S. Treasury's auction of $10 billion in 30-year bonds.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange's active list was led by Electronic Data Systems, which released disappointing second-quarter earnings after the close of trading Thursday and warned that its 1997 income would fall short of previous expectations.</p>
<p>EDS, a computer services company, was was down 7-1/16, or 15 percent, at 36, with 3.9 million shares traded.</p>
<p>America Online, which reported a 42 percent gain in second quarter revenue after the market closed Thursday was down 7/8 at 70-1/8.</p>
<p>On Nasdaq, Apple Computer Inc. was down 1-1/2 at 27-11/16, retreating from the steep gains that followed the announcement Wednesday of its agreement with Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>Informix, which reported a second-quarter loss of $120.5 million after trading ended Thursday, was down 7/8 at 9-7/16.</p>
