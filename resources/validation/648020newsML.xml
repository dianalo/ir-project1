<p>Spanish inflation is seen hitting a new low in May at 1.4/1.5 percent, giving the central bank scope for monetary easing which it may not use it, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Consumer Price Index, due on Friday, is expected to decline to an average 1.47 percent, according to a Reuter survey of economists, from 1.7 percent in April.</p>
<p>The more stable core rate was seen almost unchanged at around 1.8 percent year on year versus 1.9 percent the month before.</p>
<p>But market fears of possible delays in European economic and monetary union (EMU) project will take their toll on Spanish assets and may, as a result, keep the Bank of Spain cautious.</p>
<p>&quot;If May CPI is around 1.5 percent as expected by the market consensus, I think the Bank of Spain, in the middle of Amsterdam's meeting, would leave the key rate where it is,&quot; said Valentin Fernandez economist at Credit Lyonnais in Madrid.</p>
<p>With CPI out on Friday, the first opportunity to cut the official rate is at the central bank's repurchase agreement auction on Monday, the first of a key two-day European Union summit in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>&quot;After that, their stance will depend a lot on the results of all the summits we are going through,&quot; Fernandez added.</p>
<p>Analysts have interpreted the latest remarks from the governor of the Bank of Spain, Luis Angel Rojo, as a shift toward more caution after a period of aggressive reductions.</p>
<p>The central bank cut its key money market rate twelve times in 17 months to 5.25 percent from 9.25 in December 1995.</p>
<p>In a recent speech, Rojo said that tensions in the markets in coming months were suggesting prudent monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;..we need to keep some scope to manoeuvre interest rates because we cannot rule out extraordinary events,&quot; Rojo told a parliamentary commission.</p>
<p>But domestic reasons were also seen behind that prudence.</p>
<p>&quot;The time for prudence has arrived now,&quot; said Marco Pianelli at Nomura Research in London.</p>
<p>&quot;At other times the Bank of Spain has shrugged off foreign tensions, but now they also have domestic reasons for being less aggressive. The economy is picking up while inflation, especially at the core, is bottoming out,&quot; said Pianelli.</p>
<p>But long term the trend remains positive, with analysts still betting on a fifth rate cut sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>For if the moderation in inflation that analysts' expect materialises, real short-term rates would be left at an unusually high 3.75 percent, far higher than the 3.05 percent hit in December.</p>
<p>And, if euro convergence continues, Spanish short-term rates must close the gap to the German repo rate at three percent.</p>
<p>&quot;If uncertainty over the euro fades away and the inflation rate falls to 1.5 percent, I think that the Bank of Spain, with its usual prudence, will cut its official rate again,&quot; said Fernando Fernandez Menendez, economist at BCH.</p>
<p>With one Central bank repurchase auction on June 16 and the following on June 24, some economists said the Bank of Spain could simply delay the next monetary easing for eight days.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that the Bank of Spain will hold its key money market rate until Amsterdam's summit,&quot; said Maria Victoria Nunez, economist at Societe Generale in Madrid.</p>
