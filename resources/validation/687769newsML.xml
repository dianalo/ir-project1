<p>The Korea Stock Exchange said on Wednesday the foreign stock ownership ceiling was due to be raised to 25-26 percent in the second half of the year from 23 percent. The exchange made the forecast in a statement reviewing major changes taking effect in the second half, but a public information official said by telephone the finance ministry had yet to decide on the issue.</p>
<p>The finance ministry has promised to raise the ceiling this year but has not said by how much.  </p>
<p>South Korea also plans to open stock index options trading on July 7, the statement said.</p>
<p>From July 1, underwriters of initial public offerings would be allocated 40 percent of the total amount, compared with 20 percent at present, while public subscribers would be offered 40 percent of the total, against 60 percent at present.</p>
<p>Employees of the company making the offering would continue to be allocated 20 percent.</p>
<p>Brokerage firms would be allowed to issue corporate bonds and to underwrite, deal and broker commercial papers.  </p>
<p>Brokerage fees would be liberalised in the second half from the current ceiling of 0.6 percent for share trading and 0.3 percent for bond trading.</p>
<p>The statement also said the Seoul stock market would be fully computerised by September 1.</p>
