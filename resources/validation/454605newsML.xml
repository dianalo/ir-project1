<p>Australia on Wednesday rejected as counter-productive calls that it should cut aid payments to Papua New Guina to punish the South Pacific nation for its hiring of foreign mercenaries.</p>
<p>&quot;To retaliate now would be to end our chances of persuading Papua New Guinea to abandon their plans. And in our judgment, that would be wrong,&quot; Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told parliament.</p>
<p>Australia's Liberal-National government is under pressure from the Labor opposition and aid groups to cut aid over Port Moresby's decision to employ mercenaries to help fight secessionist rebels on Bougainville island, 800 kilometres (500 miles) from Port Moresby.</p>
<p>Australia's total aid payments to Port Moresby are around A$320 million (US$253 million) a year.</p>
<p>&quot;We've made our concerns on a number of occasions now ... about the Papua New Guinea government's decision to employ mercenaries,&quot; Downer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, it is true that some people ... have argued that Australia should move immediately to take retaliatory action against Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe we should continue doing what we are doing already, and that is seeking strenuously to persuade Papua Nrw Guinea not to use mercenaries.&quot;</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan, defying opposition within his own military, has struck a A$36 million (US$28 million) contract with a British-based mercenary company to train his under-equipped and poorly-trained troops.</p>
<p>Chan has said the foreign soldiers would travel to Bougainville, but only as trainers.</p>
<p>Australia has led international protests against the use of foreign hired guns in any capacity.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea armed forces commander Jerry Singirok on Monday demanded that Chan quit over the mercenary plan. Chan responded by sacking the rebel general -- a move rejected by many in the army rank-and-file.</p>
