<headline>BASEBALL-ORIOLES, RANGERS MOVE CLOSER TO POST-SEASON SPOTS.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1996-09-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Orioles and Rangers moved closer to securing post-season spots on Thursday as the Red Sox were eliminated and the Mariners were hanging by a thread heading into the final weekend of the season.</p>
<p>In Toronto, rookie Rocky Coppinger came within two outs of his first shutout and Brady Anderson and Cal Ripken homered as the Orioles widened their lead in the American League wild-card race by defeating the Blue Jays 4-1.</p>
<p>The win moved Baltimore 2 1/2 games ahead of Seattle and eliminated Boston from the wild-card chase.</p>
<p>Coppinger (10-6) allowed one run and five hits over 8 1/3 innings with no walks and seven strikeouts.</p>
<p>&quot;Going to bed last night I knew it was important. This is the biggest series of the year for us,&quot; Coppinger said. &quot;I was nervous going out at the beginning and then Cal's three-run homer really made me relax. In your first season in the big leagues, to get a win like this is big.&quot;</p>
<p>Anderson tied Bobby Bonds' major-league record by leading off a game with a homer for the 11th time this season. It was the 48th homer of the year for Anderson, who had three hits to break out of a 3-for-21 slump.</p>
<p>Ripken became the fourth Oriole this season to collect at least 100 RBI, breaking the team record. Ripken has 12 RBI in his last five games.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of things happened so fast, we won the World Series in my second year and I think I took it for granted,&quot; said Ripken. &quot;I've been through rebuilding and now I can see the World Series.&quot;</p>
<p>In Boston, Rudy Pemberton's two-run single capped a four-run first inning and three relievers as the Red Sox scored a 5-3 victory over the New York Yankees.</p>
<p>The Yankees had clinched the American League East title on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Texas, Will Clark capped a four-run third inning with a go-ahead sacrifice fly and the Rangers took advantage of some shoddy defence to stand on the verge of the A.L. West title with a 6-5 victory over the California Angels.</p>
<p>The Rangers, who began as the Washington Senators in 1961 and moved to Texas for the 1972 season, are still looking for their first post-season berth. The next Rangers win or Seattle loss gives Texas the Western Division title.</p>
<p>If the Rangers, 3 1/2 games up on Seattle, lose their last three games and the Mariners win their last four, a one-game playoff will be held at Seattle on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Rangers benefited from two key California errors to overcome a 3-0 deficit in the bottom of the third.</p>
<p>Mark McLemore led off with a walk off Angels starter Jim Abbott (2-18). One out later, Darryl Hamilton singled before Ivan Rodriguez delivered an RBI double. Rusty Greer hit a flyball to centre field that Darin Erstad dropped, scoring Hamilton to pull Texas within 3-2.</p>
<p>Juan Gonzalez hit a smash to third baseman Randy Velarde, who let the ball skip through his legs, tying the game and sending Greer to third. Clark followed with a sacrifice fly.</p>
<p>In Oakland, Tony Batista delivered a two-run single and Mike Bordick drew a bases-loaded walk and scored on a wild pitch in a four-run eighth inning as the Athletics rallied for a 7-5 win over the Mariners, damaging Seattle's playoff hopes.</p>
<p>The A's took their first lead in the sixth on an inside-the-park home run by catcher Terry Steinbach.</p>
<p>Steinbach's long fly to right eluded Jay Buhner and caromed back to the infield. The slow-footed Steinbach was able to race around the bases before second baseman Joey Cora could retrieve the ball.</p>
<p>It was the first inside-the-park homer for the A's since Felix Jose's in 1990 at Minnesota.</p>
<p>&quot;When I got to third and I saw (third base coach) Duffy Dyer still waving, I was thinking 'this isn't a good time to be experimenting,'&quot; Steinbach said. &quot;When the second baseman has to go into right field to make the play, that does a lot of explaining right there.&quot;</p>
<p>Steinbach's 33rd home run tied Carlton Fisk for the American League record for home runs in a season by a catcher.</p>
<p>Ken Griffey Jr hit his 49th home run for Seattle.</p>
