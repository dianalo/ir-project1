<p>Bangladesh, heavily dependent on foreign aid, may relax price controls on agricultural inputs and petroleum products to raise revenues, Finance Minister S.A.M.S. Kibria said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;They (donors) have expressed serious concern at controlling the prices of these commodities. They say the control distorts the market and strains government revenues,&quot; Kibria told a new conference at the end of a two-day review of Bangladesh's economic performance by international donors in Dhaka.</p>
<p>Kibria said his government also realised the effect of price controls on commodities, which is putting a strain on revenue needed to finance development.</p>
<p>&quot;We noted their concern. There has been massive loss of revenue because of the controls. Their (donors') suggestions will be placed with the cabinet for consideration,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Finance ministry officials said Bangladesh granted big fertiliser subsidies, and controlled prices of natural gas and petroleum products.</p>
<p>Kibria said the government's revenue collection in the six months to December fell more than two percent short of target. He blamed shrinking petroleum product revenues for the shortfall.</p>
<p>Some 30 donor countries and funding insitutions including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the United States, Canada, Germany and Britain attended the review meeting, the officials said.</p>
<p>Donors asked the government to speed up the pace of economic reforms, curb infation, cut expenditure and raise internal resources by levying fresh taxes and expand the tax base.</p>
<p>Finance ministry officials said donors made it clear that Bangladesh must implement reforms and properly utilise aid before it could seek increased assistance.</p>
<p>Bangladesh receives around $1.7 billion worth of international aid annually to finance development and imports.</p>
<p>Kibria rejected fears that the country's economy was in danger. &quot;It is far from alarming,&quot; he said. &quot;However, some areas like expenditure and revenue obviously need special attention.&quot;</p>
<p>The finance minister claimed the eight-month-old government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has scored significant macroeconomic successes such as keeping inflation at 2.71 percent over the 12 months to December 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign exchange reserves remained stable and have been hovering around $2 billion since July,&quot; Kibria said.</p>
<p>Kibria added the government was firmly committed to reform and implementing it &quot;at a speed which was feasible&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;But reform is not an easy process and there is always a price that has to be paid for it...we are tring for a broad political consensus,&quot; he said.</p>
