<title>FRANCE: European market shrugs off shock US wheat report.</title>

<p>A plunge in U.S. winter wheat sowings, which sent shockwaves through grain markets on Friday, changes little for the immediate outlook which remains subdued by southern hemisphere crops and spasmodic demand, grain traders and officials in Europe said on Monday.</p>
<p>French wheat, which rose in a knee-jerk reaction to the surprise U.S. government sowing report on Friday, lost its gains on Monday to focus on the bumper Australian crop and patchy import demand during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>&quot;The rally quickly ran out of steam,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Traders and officials said the U.S. report, showing winter sowings of 48.2 million acres compared with private forecasts of 51 million, might tighten the wheat market balance from the middle of the year but experience showed weather and demand for other grains could skew the figures well before then.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, the sowings are lower but what matters most is the harvested area which is often quite a lot lower,&quot; said Bill De Maria, assistant executive director of the London-based International Grains Council.</p>
<p>Records show harvested acres of U.S. winter wheat were 24 percent below the area sown last year at 39.7 million acres.</p>
<p>The gap was 16 percent in both 1995 and 1994, European analysts said.</p>
<p>Factors affecting the harvest area include winterkill and the area used for grazing in parts of the United States, notably in Texas where wheat is partly used as forage, De Maria said.</p>
<p>&quot;Into this volatile mix you now have to add the question of producer choice,&quot; he said, referring to the freedom given to U.S. farmers to make their own planting decisions by a major reform of U.S. farm policies passed into law last year.</p>
<p>Another unknown is the degree to which farmers will respond to any increase in prices triggered by the low winter wheat sowings to boost their sowings of spring grades.</p>
<p>The drop in winter wheat sowings was partly caused by farmers turning their backs on prices which have fallen sharply from their peaks of April 1996, U.S. analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to see the U.S. spring sowings before we can draw real conclusions,&quot; a senior French grains trader said. &quot;Usually when there is less winter wheat people sow more spring wheat.&quot;</p>
<p>For the time being, European exporters said they were focusing on competition from what looks like a record Australian wheat harvest, much of which is reckoned to be still unsold.</p>
<p>An Australian grain official said earlier on Monday the 1996/97 crop could come in at up to 24 million tonnes, smashing a 1983/84 record of 22 million tonnes.</p>
<p>A European source with a multinational trading firm said his company had projected a harvest of 22.5 million tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the heavy unknown in our calculations. Australian figures just keep rising,&quot; a senior French grain official said.</p>
<p>While U.S. sowing indications might help to brake the wheat market's nine-month decline, there was little chance it would force the market to go sustainably higher, he said.</p>
<p>European farmers' concerns about southern hemisphere wheat are seen likely to increase pressure on the European Union to go back to a strong export pace last seen in December.</p>
<p>Last week's release of 260,000 tonnes of EU wheat was a &quot;good gesture to the market&quot; but the EU is handicapped by relatively firm internal prices and the lack of a major buying campaign by the big importers, a European grain official said.</p>
<p>Analysts said demand may not be as flat as official data suggests, citing strong buying from Poland and the appearance of rarer importers like India, with poor crops. Iraq is also a factor if complex United Nations paperwork can be ironed out.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen a few people appear who weren't there before but generally in Ramadan things are quiet. These two things might just offset each other,&quot; a French grains analyst said.</p>
<p>Exporters hope French wheat sales to Iraq under a special deal with the U.N. will get a new boost from the arrival of Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz for talks on general issues with the French government from Monday.</p>
<p>But traders said execution of deals and the availability of letters of credit were both dogged by U.N. bureaucracy. France is waiting for U.N. approval of 200,000 tonnes of wheat sales.</p>
