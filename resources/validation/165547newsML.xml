<headline>IMM currency futures close mixed, as dlr rallies.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-11-05</dateline>

<p>IMM currency futures closed mixed, as the U.S. dollar rallied with booming U.S. asset markets and pushed mark, Swiss franc and yen futures further into negative territory, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bonds and stocks are happy that the status quo will be maintained,&quot; one currency trader said about expectations that Democratic President Clinton will win a second term, while Congress will remain in the hands of Republicans.</p>
<p>December marks fell through support at $0.6618 and $0.6596, as the dollar hit buy-stop orders at 1.5150 and 1.5200 spot. December set a low at $0.6587, about 1.5215 spot.  </p>
<p>Marc Chandler, analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said the 3.6-percent drop in German September industry orders contributed to weakness in mark futures.</p>
<p>The weakness in the Germany economy helped push rates on German bunds lower, and sparked a fresh shift overnight into high-yielding currencies like the French franc and Sterling.</p>
<p>Sterling futures ended only marginally higher after setting a fresh contract high of $1.6526 in December. Traders said Sterling futures were supported by cash Sterling's gains against marks and yen. The cash Sterling/mark cross rose above 2.50 this afternoon.  </p>
<p>Some analysts are looking for the cross rate to rise to 2.52 in the near term.</p>
<p>Cash mark's weakness against the dollar indirectly contributed to a sell-off in Swiss franc futures, traders said. In addition, early reports that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's heart bypass operation was successful caused some investors to unwind long Swiss franc positions.</p>
<p>Several analysts said sentiment regarding the U.S. elections shifted due to various polls and surveys indicating the Congressional Republicans would stay in control.  </p>
<p>&quot;If the House goes to the Democrats, people will be afraid of more protectionist trade policies, in which case you should see people increasing long yen positions,&quot; Chandler said. &quot;But you aren't seeing that.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar soared through 114.00, pushing December yen through the initial support level of $0.008820, and tested 114.30 spot, which roughly corresponds to the December yen's daily low of $0.008794.</p>
<p>December yen closed above $0.008806, or 114.20 spot yen, as December marks held above $0.6574, or the pivot point of 1.5250 spot marks.  </p>
<p>At the end of pit trade, December yen lost $0.000021 at $0.008812, marks fell $0.0033 at $0.6604, Swiss francs were down $0.0058 at $0.7869, sterling was up $0.0008 at $1.6452, Canadian dollars rose $0.0026 at $0.7533, Australian dollars were steady at $0.7861 and Mexican pesos were down $0.000100 at $0.123050. -Derivatives desk 312-408-8750;E-mail derivatives@reuters.com</p>
