<p>Spain said on Tuesday it had</p>
<p>signed an agreement to sell state-owned aluminium group Inespal to U.S.-based Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) for 61.5 billion pesetas ($400 million).</p>
<p>Alcoa has also pledged to invest an additional 65 billion pesetas in the group, which has shown losses of more than 67 billion pesetas since 1990 despite turning a profit in the last two years.</p>
<p>Inespal workers -- whose jobs are secured under the plan -- had protested a preliminary deal, staging a series of short strikes this month amid fears of job losses.</p>
<p>&quot;A key part of the deal is the industrial plan which I consider very appropriate from both the labour side, as it ensures jobs, and more investments than Inespal had planned,&quot; Industry Minister Josep Pique told reporters.</p>
<p>The operation, which involves Inespal's four main business divisions and a total of nine industrial plants and central services in Madrid, must be approved by the Spanish government and the European Commission, the Brussels-based European Union executive.</p>
<p>&quot;SEPI (Spain's state holding group) considers that the Alcoa offer supposes a guarantee of viability for the Inespal industrial project,&quot; a statement from the holding group said.</p>
<p>Inespal will represent 50 percent of Alcoa's European revenue. It will represent 100 percent of Alcoa's European aluminium production, 67 percent of its primary aluminium and 52 percent of its laminates.</p>
<p>In addition to Inespal, Spain resolved the future of steel-producer Corporacion Siderurgica Integral (CSI) on Tuesday, agreeing to sell a 35 percent stake to Luxembourg steel maker Arbed.</p>
<p>Pique said Spain's process of aggressive privatisation would continue.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the process has picked up pace. We're are going to continue down this road because I think it's what this country needs and it has been well-received by the markets,&quot; Pique said. ($ = 154.8 Spanish Pesetas)</p>
