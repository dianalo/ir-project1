<p>Norway's Statoil broke new ground on Thursday by streamlining its North Sea production profile via a complex clutch of asset swaps instead of through cash deals with rivals, analysts said.</p>
<p>Den norske stats oljeselskap AS (Statoil) swapped a batch of U.K. and Norwegian assets with oil giants British Petroleum Plc and Chevron Corp, and exchanged interests in Norwegian exploration licences with Norsk Hydro SDB, Elf Aquitaine and Total SA.</p>
<p>Some 21 licences were involved in the deals, codenamed &quot;Rubicon&quot;, with a total value of between five and six billion crowns ($700-$830 million), the Norwegian state oil company said.</p>
<p>&quot;The main reason we have done this is to focus our attention on two core areas in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and in two selected areas in the U.K.,&quot; said Wencke Skorge, spokeswoman for Statoil.</p>
<p>The deals are part of a recent trend for larger oil companies in the North Sea to sell their older assets to small, nimble companies with lower overheads, and to concentrate on core production areas, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a slight decrease in our oil production but an increase in gas output but these are really side effects,&quot; Skorge said.</p>
<p>The asset re-arrangement would help Statoil hit its output target of a million barrels per day of oil by 2005, she said.</p>
<p>Philip Lambert, head of oil and gas at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in London, who advised Statoil on the deals, said that this was the largest and most complex asset swap ever attempted in the North Sea.</p>
<p>&quot;This deal will alert other people to the fact that it can be done. It is a constructive way for the oil industry to move forward,&quot; said Lambert.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there will be many more of these types of deals,&quot; he added. &quot;The asset swap concept is one that companies should be looking at.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The restructuring of portfolios are best done with assets changing hands like this, rather than through cash auctions -- cash is a commodity that is not of such great interest to a number of oil companies at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To a great extent there is a capital surplus in this business,&quot; Lambert said.</p>
<p>Steve Scullion, oil and gas analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said that the deal did not represent a geographical shift by Statoil, or a preference for one form of hydrocarbon over another.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a tinkering with the tail of Statoil's portfolio and is using that tail to trade into other assets which offer greater value. Even in value terms it's relatively significant but it's not a real company maker,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Statoil has been traditionally been focused in Norway but is now a truly global player,&quot; Scullion said.</p>
<p>For U.S. oil giant Chevron the deal helped in the revamp of its British businesses, underway for a couple of years, and served as a springboard to broaden its portfolio in Europe, said Scullion.</p>
<p>Chevron sold interests in four mature fields in the British North Sea a year ago to relative minnow Oryx Energy Co and to Ranger Oil Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;There were major upheavals and Chevron is now a fairly lean operator in the U.K., with a young portfolio of assets,&quot; Scullion said.</p>
<p>&quot;Chevron can use this deal to get back into the Norwegian sector and develop a European presence, now that it has sorted out its U.K. base,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>BP wanted the deals to strengthen and consolidate the company's near term production profile around an existing core area, said Lambert.</p>
<p>Elf Aquitaine and Norsk Hydro SDB also said on Thursday they were swapping interests on the Norwegian continental shelf in a separate bilateral deal.</p>
<p>&quot;This is probably all part of the restructuring of portfolios that is going on at the moment,&quot; Lambert said.</p>
