<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures were expected to open steady to lower Wednesday after news surfaced that Transco had completed repairs on its offshore Louisiana gas line, traders said.</p>
<p>August over-the-counter trade ranged from $2.105 to $2.12 after settling to the upside Tuesday at $2.116 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>August climbed to a high of $2.142 on ACCESS when news of a gas leak seeped into the market, but Transco said today that the 400 million cubic feet per day of gas shut in Tuesday night was back in the market.  </p>
<p>The leak occurred on a small line out of Ship Shoal block 214 off the Louisiana coast. Before the company's announcement that repairs were complete, traders speculated the gas would likely be shut in two to four days.</p>
<p>Technical traders said support in August was at $2.08-2.10 and then at Tuesday's low of $2.051 and $2. Resistance was seen at $2.15 and then along the down trendline at $2.25-2.26.</p>
<p>In Tuesday's cash, Gulf Coast prices held around $2.10. Midcon pipes were unchanged to one cent higher at $1.99-2.00, while New York city gate gas was quoted little changed in the high-$2.30s.</p>
<p>Cash prices at the Henry Hub were talked early Wednesday two to three cents higher at $2.14-2.18.</p>
<p>Injection estimates for today's weekly AGA storage report range from 70 to 100 bcf versus a 90 bcf build for the same week last year.</p>
