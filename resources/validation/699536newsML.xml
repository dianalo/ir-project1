<p>Corporate bond new issue activity will continue at a sluggish pace as a two-day meeting of Federal Reserve policy-makers and a shortened holiday week keep players sidelined, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The tone in the market is the same as yesterday for investment grades ... we won't see much activity until next week,&quot;  said one high grade syndicate source. &quot;Most issuance is expected to come from the junk side.&quot;</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee convenes in Washington today to discuss U.S. monetary policy.  </p>
<p>In a Reuter poll, U.S. economists predicted the FOMC would keep the federal funds rate steady at 5.50 percent.</p>
<p>Players also kept a watchful eye on the National Association of Purchasing Management index for June, which slipped to 55.7 from May's 57.1.</p>

<p>Also on today's calendar is Sun Healthcare Group's $250 million in 10-year senior subordinated notes via Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities. Price talk on the issue is seen between 275 and 300 basis points, players said.</p>
<p>Another $200 million in 144a debt is expected to come from Citadel Broadcasting Co. The deal includes $100 million in 10-year senior subordinated notes and $100 million of an exchange pik preferred issue due 2009, sources said.  </p>
<p>Players said talk on the 10-year notes is seen between 10 percent and 10.25 percent. Spread talk on the pik preferred issue is seen in at 12.75 percent to 13 percent, they said.</p>
<p>Price Communications Wireless Inc will set $200 million in 10-year senior subordinated 144a notes. Price talk is seen around 11.50 percent, sources said.</p>
<p>Also, Price Communications Cellular Holdings is expected to sell $50 million in 10-year discount notes, also via DLJ.</p>
<p>Price Communications Wireless and Price Communications Cellular are units of Price Communications Corp.  </p>
<p>Another $200 million in 144a 10-year notes is expected from Calpine Corp via Credit Suisse First Boston. Spread talk is seen between 212 and 237 basis points, sources said.</p>
<p>Nine West Group will bring to market its $325 million two-part 144a debt offering via Merrill Lynch. The deal includes $175 million in eight-year senior notes and $150 million in 10-year senior subordinated notes, sources said.</p>
<p>Price talk on the Ba2/BB rated eight-year issue is seen in the 187.5 basis points area. Talk on the Ba3/B-plus rated 10-year paper is seen at 50 basis points, they said.</p>
<p>Another $110 million in seven-year 144a debt is expected to come to market from West Coast Entertainment via Credit Suisse First Boston. Players said price talk on the issue was seen between 10.625 percent and 10.875 percent.</p>
<p>As the week progresses, the pace of issuance will slow ahead of a shortened trading session on Thursday and the U.S. Independence Day holiday on Friday.</p>
