<title>NORWAY: Norway commission probes FIBA Nordic Securities.</title>
<headline>Norway commission probes FIBA Nordic Securities.</headline>
<dateline>OSLO 1996-09-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Norwegian Banking, Securities and Insurance Commission said on Friday it had launched an investigation into Oslo-based FIBA Nordic Securities AS and its cooperation with Fiba Nordic Securities (FNS) of London.</p>
<p>Broker FNS is involved in the storm over holdings of three temporarily-suspended Morgan Grenfell European funds.</p>
<p>Eystein Kleven, an official of the commission, told Reuters a letter had been sent to broker FIBA Nordic Securities AS, a subsidiary of FIBA ASA, asking for a full report.</p>
<p>He said the commission was aware that the Oslo broker carried out back-office functions for business struck in Norway by London-based FIBA.</p>
<p>&quot;The commission, as a result of this, wants a full report on the cooperation between the Norwegian and English FIBA, including how the tasks were carried out legally and how they were done in practise,&quot; the letter said.</p>
<p>It gave FIBA in Oslo until 1 p.m. (1100gmt) on Monday to respond.</p>
<p>Asked if any legal consequences would result from the probe, Kleven said: &quot;It all depends on what information we get, to what extent FIBA Nordic (in Oslo) has been involved in this. We must first find out what has actually happened.&quot;</p>
<p>The letter said the commission assumed that FIBA Nordic Securities AS &quot;knows about the investments and issues reported to have been made by FIBA London in Norway on behalf of Morgan Grenfell funds, possibly on behalf of the company Morgan Grenfell itself&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In this connection an explanation is sought for which trade/issues that FIBA London has carried out in Norway in 1996 for Morgan Grenfell and the funds administered by this company,&quot; the letter said.</p>
<p>The commission said it also wanted to find out the circumstances around the purchase of shares in the Norwegian software company Sysdeco AS.</p>
<p>It also was seeking to find out who paid and who received payment for this and other transactions in Norway by FIBA.</p>
<p>Kleven said the commission was not going to investigate FNS &quot;because that is the responsibility of the British authorities&quot;.</p>
