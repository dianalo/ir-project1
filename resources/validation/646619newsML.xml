<p>A major Bulgarian shipyard in the Black Sea port of Bourgas, 450 km (280 miles) east of Sofia, went on strike on Monday demanding higher wages and replacement of the current management, company officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;More than half of the 1,200 workers stopped working today demanding higher wages... Their demands are unrealistic and cannot be met,&quot; the shipyard's executive director, Todor Georgiev told Reuters, by telephone from Bourgas.</p>
<p>The shipyard's trade union leader, Velichko Evtimov, said the workers shut down production after the management failed to meet pledges for a 150 percent wage rise, failed provide sufficient work load, and did not show a 1997 work plan.</p>
<p>Evtimov said they were determined to go on with the strike until their demands were met. He added that a meeting with the industry ministry, supervising the shipyard, was scheduled for Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Industry Ministry in Sofia declined comment.</p>
<p>&quot;The shipyard is a fully state-owned company and raising wages would violate the government's latest wage payment regulations,&quot; said Georgiev.</p>
<p>In a bid to curb budget spending as part of introducing an IMF-prescribed currency board system in July, Bulgaria's cabinet issued a decree two weeks ago imposing severe fines on state companies paying higher wages then regulated.</p>
<p>The average wage in the Bourgas shipyards was around 120,000 levs ($72), said Georgiev.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no possibility to fulfil workers' demands to raise salaries to $120, even though they were agreed end-January,&quot; said Georgiev.</p>
<p>Month-long mass protests and strikes in January toppled a Socialist government two years ahead of its term for leading the country into an unprecedented economic crisis.</p>
<p>The Bourgas shipyards, one of the country's three shipbuilders, has 12,000 tonnes output capacity, said Georgiev. At the moment it was repairing one ship.</p>
<p>&quot;With this strike we are losing clients' confidence,&quot; said Georgiev.</p>
<p>The Bourgas shipyard, due to be privatised this year, posted 99 million levs profit for the first quarter of 1997 compared to a 32 million levs loss in the same period of the previous year, Georgiev said. ($=1.667 levs)</p>
