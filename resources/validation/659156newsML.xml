<p>Cuba's central bank chief Francisco Soberon on Friday defended the communist-ruled island's currency system, saying Cubans live better than their average salary of $10 per month would suggest.</p>
<p>&quot;If we really earned $10 a month we wouldn't be here,&quot; he told a conference of Latin American economists.</p>
<p>Soberon, president of the Banco Nacional de Cuba, said state-subsidised food rations, low rent and electricity bills, free health care and free education all help to offset the financial disparity.</p>
<p>Cuba's average monthly wage of 203 pesos, converted into U.S. dollars at the street exchange rate of 20 pesos, results in the $10 per month figure. Critics say the state subsidy system often fails to meet the needs of the average Cuban family, which must negotiate in a confusing marketplace where both Cuban pesos and U.S. dollars are in circulation.</p>
<p>At unsubsidized farm markets, a small banana costs one peso, and some goods such as canned food, soap and cooking oil are available only in hard currency stores, where prices are in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>Soberon acknowledged that having both pesos and dollars in circulation was not satisfactory and said Havana eventually aimed to have a single currency again. He did not say when or how this might be achieved but he said it would be &quot;extremely complicated&quot; and would have to be managed with &quot;exquisite care.&quot;</p>
<p>Dollars were legalised in 1993 at the height of Cuba's economic crisis as the government, which has a state monopoly on hard currency retail sales, sought to pull in hard currency circulating in the country. The move led to huge wealth disparities between the average peso wage earner and Cubans who have dollars through remittances from family abroad or because they work with foreigners.</p>
<p>The gap has eased somewhat since the peso recovered from a low of 150 to the dollar in mid-1994 to 20 to the dollar.</p>
