<title>RUSSIA: Krasnoyarsk hydro to separate from power utility.</title>

<p>Shareholders in Russia's Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric station, which supplies 75 percent of the power of regional electric company Krasnoyarskenergo, voted to separate from the structure of the power utility, shareholder Rossiisky Kredit Bank said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Shareholders voted for leaving the structure of Krasnoyarskenergo,&quot; Vladimir Zhadan, chief specialist in the bank's corporate finance department, told Reuters of the meeting that took place on June 17. No comment was available immediately from Krasnoyarskenergo.  </p>
<p>&quot;Krasnoyarskenergo itself did not vote against the move, although it has a blocking stake,&quot; Zhadan said. &quot;Krasnoyarsk hyrdoelectric station produces 75 percent of Krasnoyarskenergo's capacity,&quot; he added. Hydro station officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>Zhadan said the change in the company's charter separating it from Krasnoyarskenergo would in practice mean a separation from national power utility UES, which owns majority stakes in most of Russia's power companies.</p>
<p>After last year's general shareholders meeting Krasnoyarskenergo held a 51.9 percent stake in the hydroelectric station. It retained a 27.9 percent stake in the hydroelectric station after the sale of a stake comprising several percent of shares and the transferral of 20 percent stake to the regional company TONAKO.</p>
<p>Zhadan said the station was continuing to sell its electricity to Krasnoyarskenergo for the time being. &quot;Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric station is for now selling its electricity to Krasnoyarskenergo. By all appearances the head of (Krasnoyarskenergo) hopes that this will continue,&quot; Zhadan said.</p>
