<p>Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen has warned that plans for European monetary union (EMU) are being threatened by a lack of political integration and fundamental differences between France and Germany.</p>
<p>Jochimsen told reporters at a dinner on Wednesday evening that monetary union &quot;hangs in the balance&quot; because last week's Amsterdam summit of European Union leaders failed to provide a solid basis for further political integration.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not against the euro. It can be a good thing if the political and economic preconditions are right. They are not at present,&quot; Jochimsen said.</p>
<p>EU leaders in Amsterdam agreed on the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; without mapping a clear path for integration or outlining a political vision for Europe, he said.</p>
<p>Jochimsen said they failed to agree on the issue of majority voting, on the future distribution of votes in the Council of Ministers, on reducing the size of the European Commission and on improving EU coordination on foreign and defence policy.</p>
<p>The stability and growth pact designed to ensure budget discipline after monetary union did not guarantee the success of the euro, he said.</p>
<p>The pact lacked teeth in practice and was no substitute for the absence of political coherence and of confidence by EU states in each other.</p>
<p>Jochimsen warned that France and Germany urgently needed to resolve fundamental differences over French calls for a political counterweight to the European Central Bank and for EU-wide policies to create jobs.</p>
<p>That dissent had placed a &quot;heavy burden&quot; on European integration, Jochimsen said.</p>
<p>He supported the German view that job creation measures were a matter for national governments and that there could be no &quot;European solution to unemployment&quot;.</p>
<p>The Amsterdam summit approved the pact together with a resolution on boosting employment and growth, included at French insistence.</p>
<p>Jochimsen said he was concerned debate in the coming months would focus on speculation that the Maastricht Treaty's convergence criteria would be softened because of fears France no longer wanted to, and Germany no longer could, fulfil them strictly.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very worried that the commitment to fiscal discipline before and after monetary union has not really been accepted,&quot; Jochimsen said.</p>
<p>He said the EU should stick to the scheduled January 1, 1999 start date for EMU even if only a small number of countries were able to qualify.</p>
<p>But asked if he saw a danger of a postponement, Jochimsen said: &quot;Yes, very much so, very much so.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that a postponement would not necessarily lead to a sustained appreciation of the mark on foreign exchanges.</p>
<p>Jochimsen said the choice of EMU members should depend more on their ability to maintain lasting fiscal discipline than on exact adherence to the deficit and debt reference levels.</p>
<p>The Maastricht Treaty states a nation's budget deficit must not exceed three percent of its gross domestic product and that its public debt must not exceed 60 percent.</p>
<p>Jochimsen said the treaty gave &quot;stability-oriented leeway&quot; for interpretation, allowing an overshoot of the reference levels in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>&quot;The debate about decimal points is not the real issue, long-term adherence is,&quot; he said.</p>
