<title>USA: US debt managers boost corporate allocations - MCM.</title>
<headline>US debt managers boost corporate allocations - MCM.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>A majority of U.S. fixed-income managers overweighted corporate debt positions on their U.S. debt portfolios over the past week, an MCM MoneyWatch Inc survey said.</p>
<p>&quot;Cash positions dropped sharply ... as money was put to work in last week's rally,&quot; said MCM MoneyWatch vice president Astrid Adolfson, who conducts the weekly survey.</p>
<p>Adolfson said the buying seemed to have been in corporates with 75 percent of the respondents showing an overweighted position.  </p>
<p>The survey showed durations as a percentage of benchmark slipped to 108.1 percent in the week ending June 9 from 108.2 in the prior week.</p>
<p>A duration reading above 100 percent indicates the group of investors polled is mostly long on the market.</p>
<p>A portfolio's duration represents its average maturity and is used by portfolio managers to calculate exposure to risk.</p>
<p>In the &quot;next likely move&quot; category, portfolio managers representing 32 percent of total assets in the survey said they would &quot;buy,&quot; compared with 37 percent the prior week.  </p>
<p>Strategists leaning toward &quot;sell&quot; held steady at 12 percent.</p>
<p>Fifty-six percent of managers said they were &quot;neutral&quot; on the market.</p>
<p>Cash as a percentage of assets fell to 2.89 percent from 3.09 percent registered the previous week.</p>
<p>The survey showed 36 percent of investors polled overweighted the 10-plus years duration sector, higher from the 30-percent in the previous week, while 8.0 percent underweighted it. The remaining 56 percent were &quot;neutral.&quot;  </p>
<p>In the five- to 10-year duration sector, 43 percent of investors polled said they overweighted the securities and 11 percent underweighted them.</p>
<p>The survey included 38 domestic participants who manage about $110 billion in fixed-income assets. The poll is conducted weekly by MCM and usually is released on Tuesday.  </p>
