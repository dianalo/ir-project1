<p>German sportswear maker Adidas AG said on Tuesday that it expected &quot;further steady growth&quot; after reporting record third-quarter sales and earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;Our business outlook, based on a 30 percent increase in our order backlog, is very positive,&quot; Adidas chief executive Robert Louis-Dreyfus said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We are expecting further steady growth for Adidas.&quot;</p>
<p>Adidas, best known for its three-stripe logo, said net sales for the third quarter rose 35 percent to 1.47 billion marks ($984.8 million) from 1.09 billion in the year-ago quarter. Net income rose 17 percent to 140 million marks from 120 million marks.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased with our latest results which confirm the continuing success of the brand in the marketplace,&quot; he said. &quot;It is another step forward towards realising our mission to become the best sports brand in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Adidas, which is based in Herzogenaurach, said its apparel sales rose 45.5 percent while overall footwear sales rose 24.2 percent year-on-year growth.</p>
<p>Europe was still the engine behind Adidas' growth, with sales topping one billion marks for the first time in company history to 1.01 billion marks.</p>
<p>Sales in North America grew by an above-average 44 percent to 314 million marks from 218 million marks in the 1995 third quarter.</p>
<p>Net sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew to 119 million marks from 98 million marks, a year-on-year gain of 22 percent, while turnover in Latin America rose 17 percent to 28 million marks from 24 million marks.</p>
<p>For the first nine months of the year, Adidas said European sales rose to 2.53 billion marks from 1.91 billion marks in the year-ago period, while sales in North America rose by 27 percent and in Asia by 30 percent.</p>
<p>Adidas said its trade receivables rose 36 percent to 953 million marks as of September 30, which was slightly above the sales growth of 35 percent for the third quarter.</p>
<p>The company said almost one-third of the growth was due to the inclusion of the Italian joint venture on 1996 results.</p>
<p>Inventories rose by 36.2 percent to 828 million marks.</p>
<p>&quot;The major reasons behind this increase are an increase in open orders and, to a lesser extent, the inclusion of new subsidiaries,&quot; Adidas said in a statement.</p>
<p>Order backlog remained strong, with the level as of September 30 for deliveries scheduled from October 1996 to March 1997 up 30 percent over year-ago levels.</p>
<p>In addition, Adidas said about 500,000 pairs of its new &quot;Feet You Wear&quot; shoes launched in the 1996 third quarter had been sold by the end of September.</p>
<p>It said future sales in different categories were up by a double-digit growth rate.</p>
