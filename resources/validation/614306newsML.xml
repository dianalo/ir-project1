<p>SUGAR - World market for May 23, 1997</p>
<p>White sugar futures in London ended mixed in quiet dealings. August added 70 cents to close at $321.00 per tonne, while October lost 20 cents to close at $310.40 per tonne. There was no fresh news to influence prices. The markets in the UK and the United States are closed on Monday. Raw sugar futures in New York finished firmer in near session highs, but activity remained thin ahead of the holiday weekend. Many players started their memorial day weekend early, which left volume slim. Thai raw sugar premiums were slightly higher as the market expected more buying by China on the back of strong whites premiums. With the white sugar premium at almost $100 per tonne, China is expected to speed up its tolling business especially as Thailand has no more white sugar left in stock. Thailand sold out of white sugar earlier in the season because of strong demand, mostly from Indonesia. July added 5 points to close at 11.11 cents/lb, while October closed 4 points higher at 10.91 cents/lb.</p>

<p>The first contingent of sugar (16,574 tonnes of French white sugar) bought by Iraq under its oil-for-food deal with the United Nations, reached the country. Iraq began in April distributing food to its citizens under the oil deal, which lets Baghdad sell $2 bln worth of oil over six months to meet urgent needs of Iraqis hit by UN trade sanctions since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
