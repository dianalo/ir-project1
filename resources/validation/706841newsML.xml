<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair is to hold a reception for the British Lions later this year to mark their test series victory over South Africa, team officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Blair contacted Lions manager Fran Cotton by fax, saying: &quot;On my return from Hong Kong I wanted to send my congratulations to you and the Lions squad on your magnificent triumph at the weekend. To the great Lions team of Willie John McBride of 1974 mut now be added the team of '97.</p>
<p>&quot;I shall be holding a sports reception at Downing Street later this summer and would be delighted if you and the Lions squad were able to come. Well done again. Now go and make it three-nil. The whole country is behind you.&quot;</p>
<p>In other Lions news, injured Scottish lock Doddie Weir has returned to South Africa just in time to cheer the team on at Ellis Park. Weir's active part in the tour ended when he was stamped on by Mpumalanga lock Marius Bosman.</p>
<p>His career seemed threatened but the player has subsequently been told an operation is not necessary and he should be able to resume light training in two months.</p>
<p>England centre Jeremy Guscott wins his eighth Lions cap on Saturday, joining Irishman Mike Gibson as the most capped Lions centre.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a great honour just to be mentioned in the same breath as Mike Gibson because he was a great player,&quot; Guscott said. &quot;But I don't want to detract from the other players on this tour because it's been a team effort all along&quot;.</p>
