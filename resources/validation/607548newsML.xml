<text>
<p>The Philippine Central Bank said on Thursday it cut its overnight rates by two percentage points each.</p>
<p>Its overnight borrowing rate is now down to 18 percent from 20 percent and overnight lending to 20 percent from 22 percent.  </p>
<p>Traders said they had expected the Central Bank to lower its rates as the currency market calmed after recent speculation against the peso following the Thai baht's problems.</p>
<p>The move to cut rates by the Central Bank came a week after it was forced to raise rates by 8.75 percentage points to protect the peso.</p>
<p>&quot;He (the Central Bank) has started to lower his rates gradually. That's what we had expected him to do,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Traders said the Central Bank would likely see how the peso would react to the new rate cut before bringing down rates further.</p>
