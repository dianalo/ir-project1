<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on Wednesday he and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori plan to meet in Toronto on Saturday to discuss ways to end the six-week-old Lima hostage crisis.</p>
<p>In a sign of growing worry that negotiations to free the 72 captives at the Japanese ambassador's residence were stalled, Hashimoto said Fujimori wanted the meeting as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;President Fujimori has told us he wants to discuss the Peruvian situation with me as soon as possible,&quot; Hashimoto told reporters.</p>
<p>Hashimoto, who this week indicated Japanese concern that Fujimori is taking chances with the captives' lives by stepping up psychological pressure on the hostage-takers, said he planned to leave on Friday and return to Tokyo on Sunday.</p>
<p>Under the Japanese constitution he needs to go through the formality of getting parliament's approval before making any overseas trip but this is regarded as a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Diet (parliament) permits, I want to leave for the meeting Friday night,&quot; Hashimoto said.</p>
<p>Government sources said Canada was chosen as a site for the meeting because Canadian Ambassador to Peru Anthony Vincent was on a so-called peace panel which it was hoped would be the forum for negotiations between the guerrillas and Peru's government.</p>
<p>Both sides have accepted the panel's role in the crisis.</p>
<p>The other members of the panel are Michel Minnig, the Lima head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and Lima's Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani.</p>
<p>In the past two days, Hashimoto has urged Fujimori in telephone calls to be careful about stepping up pressure on the leftist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) guerrillas.</p>
<p>Isaac Velazco, the MRTA's international spokesman, told Reuters by telephone from Hamburg, that Hashimoto in his meeting with Fujimori should demand a &quot;political solution&quot; to the siege.</p>
<p>&quot;If Japan really wants to guarantee the safety of its nationals held at the residence, it should use its influence and economic power so that Fujimori respects what is Japanese territory and it should demand a political solution to the occupation,&quot; Velazco said.</p>
<p>Efforts to start talks with the guerrillas have stalled over the main rebel demand of freedom for about 400 jailed comrades, which Fujimori has refused to discuss.</p>
<p>The MRTA rebels seized hundreds of guests when they stormed a garden party at the ambassador's residence on December 17.</p>
<p>They have kept captive ones they consider the most important bargaining chips, including two Peruvian ministers, generals, security chiefs and about two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats, including the Japanese and Bolivian ambassadors.</p>
<p>The rebels fired several bullets on Monday at police aboard a convoy of armoured cars after officers made obscene gestures toward the residence while parading by.</p>
<p>&quot;We recognise the need to tighten the guard around the residence but want you to take sufficient care that nothing unexpected occurs,&quot; Hashimoto told the Peruvian president in a telephone call on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In an apparent reaction to the call, the Peruvian government on Tuesday announced it was considering closer cooperation with Tokyo to help end the siege peacefully.</p>
<p>Fujimori, whose brother Pedro is among the captives, has insisted the police moves are not a prelude to an assault but a tightening of security prior to talks and a negotiated exit.</p>
