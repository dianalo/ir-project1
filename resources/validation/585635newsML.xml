<p>The head of U.S. investment bank Dillon, Read &amp; Co Inc will take a pivotal role in the corporate finance activities of SBC Warburg when the two combine, it emerged on Thursday.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the surprise $600 million acquisition of Dillon Read by Swiss Bank Corp, Franklin &quot;Fritz&quot; Hobbs will become head of corporate finance world-wide for the new group, to be called SBC Warburg Dillon Read, Dillon executives said.</p>
<p>Hobbs, currently president and chief executive officer of Dillon Read, will be based in London while George Feiger, who was global corporate finance head, will move to Switzerland to be chief strategist and advisor to SBC chief executive Marcel Ospel.</p>
<p>Feiger joined SBC Warburg from management consultancy firm McKinsey to assist the merger and integration of British investment bank SG Warburg with Swiss Bank Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;Dillon Read will be managing world-wide corporate finance,&quot; one banker told Reuters. The firm has a list of blue-chip clients and has advised on deals including the $4.3 billion recapitalisation of Levi Strauss &amp; Co and the $13.1 billion sale of Rockwell International Corp aerospace division to Boeing Co.</p>
<p>Dillon Read, which was founded in 1832, had been expected to be taken over by Dutch financial services giant ING but talks between them collapsed on Wednesday and the SBC deal surfaced overnight.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously everyone was betting on ING. We were very surprised about SBC,&quot; said one Dillon Read insider who declined to be named. Others close to the deal said talks between SBC and Dillon Read had been going on for only two-and-a-half weeks.</p>
<p>Precise details of the terms of the acquisition, which gives SBC a firm foothold in corporate advisory work on Wall Street, are unlikely to be revealed.</p>
<p>But analysts said it was important that Dillon Read partners, who own 75 percent of the firm and have an option to buy the remainder at book price from ING, would remain in the new group.</p>
<p>Not only has Hobbs been given the important corporate finance role but Francois de Saint Phalle, Dillon Read vice chairman and chief operating officer, was named as deputy head of equity capital markets world-wide and co-head of U.S. equities, Dillon chairman John Birkelund said.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal Dillon Read's partners, who will make huge gains as a result of the buy-out, have signed restrictive deals keeping them at the merged firm, banking sources said.</p>
<p>In addition payment for Dillon Read will be staggered over two-and-a-half years, benefiting the partners in the privately owned firm.</p>
<p>&quot;They were rich before they started and now they are even richer,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>It was not immediately apparent what would happen to Dillon Read's London operation, where it employs around 45 people and has two main business lines.</p>
<p>Dillon Read &amp; Co Inc sells U.S. equities to European institutions while Dillon Read Securities, which has been operating for about 10 years, covers the European markets and sells to UK institutions as well as U.S. and continental European clients.</p>
<p>The firm also has a small corporate finance operation in London working from the offices of ING Barings, but this only employs around five.</p>
<p>Banking sources said SBC Warburg, as a pre-eminent European brokerage, already covered the markets serviced by Dillon Read in London, making the future of the operation here uncertain.</p>
