<p>Snow and ice stranded about 10,000 rail and road travellers in southern France overnight, forcing them to camp out in trains, cars or in emergency centres such as schools and sports halls.</p>
<p>An 86-year-old German, caught in a bus with other tourists, died of heart failure caused by the cold in Malataverne in the southeast, police said. His death raised the toll in France from the cold snap to 23, France Info public radio said.</p>
<p>About 30 trains were halted by ice on overhead power lines and freezing points in southern France, forcing more than 5,000 people to sleep in trains, stations and about 15 special centres including barracks and schools, rail officials said.</p>
<p>Train services between the Mediterranean port of Marseille and France's second city Lyon were cancelled on Friday morning because of the cold. SNCF guaranteeed only routes between Paris-Lyon, Paris-Grenoble and Paris-Savoie.</p>
<p>Police said up to about 5,000 motorists were also trapped overnight on roads in the Rhone Valley, where the A7 motorway, the main north-south artery, was blocked by black ice and snow over a distance of about 100 km (60 miles).</p>
<p>The army, Red Cross, police and other emergency workers were called out to help stranded drivers and recommended people to avoid travelling. The A7 partly reopened to traffic on Friday morning in both directions, restricted to a single lane.</p>
<p>Slightly higher temperatures and rain spreading up from the Mediterranean might help clear some of the snow during the day.</p>
<p>Smaller airports ranging from Avignon and Valence in the south to Cherbourg in the north were closed by the icy conditions. France's biggest airports were open but operating with frequent delays.</p>
<p>Ice blocked many canals and chunks of ice cut off river traffic on the Loire river in western France.</p>
<p>Oyster farmers, meanwhile, worried that that their produce could freeze to death on the way to market.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Siberia!&quot; the daily Le Parisien said. But it noted France was still far from the cold snaps of 1709, when more than a million people died of famine and epidemics, or 1880 when the Seine froze and the Invalides bridge collapsed into the river.</p>
