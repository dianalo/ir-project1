<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures mostly ended lower Thursday in fairly active trade, with Augu sources said.</p>
<p>August inched up 0.1 cent to close at $2.175 per million British thermal units after rallying early to $2.225 on the storm hype. September settled 2.6 cents lower at $2.132. Other deferreds ended down by 1.1 to 1.9 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a lot to deal with with the weather today, but the market didn't react that much. We seem to be looking for something that changes the fundamentals, but we didn't get it today,&quot; said one New York-based futures trader, noting August failed to pierce key resistance despite the stifling heat and concerns about U.S. Gulf production cuts due to the storm.</p>
<p>The following pipelines reported production cuts today because of Tropical Storm Danny:</p>
<p>- Columbia Gulf - 90 mmcfd</p>
<p>- ANR Pipeline - 140 mmcfd</p>
<p>- Transco - 50-100 mmcfd</p>
<p>- Tennessee - 200 mmcfd</p>
<p>Danny's center was 115 miles southwest of New Orleans and moving northeast at about 5 mph with winds of up to 60 mph. The eye of the storm was expected to make landfall in Louisiana late Thursday or early Friday.</p>
<p>Separately, the National Hurricopical Depression 5, located 12.4 north, 53.4 west or about 475 miles east of the Windward Islands, could become a tropical storm (Erika) later today or tomorrow. TD5 was moving west northwest at 14 mph with sustained winds of 35 mph.</p>
<p>But with more moderate weather expected by the weekend and next week, most agreed further gains could be difficult though few wanted to aggressively sell futures with cash carrying a 10-cent premium and the potential for more storm-related cuts.</p>
<p>Chart traders still pegged key August resistance at the down trendline at $2.23, with most agreeing only a close above that level would turn the technical picture bullish. Further resistance was seen at $2.29 and $2.36. Support was pegged at $2.15 and then at last week's low of $2.051.</p>
<p>In the cash Thursday, Gulf Coast prices firmed four to five cents to the low-to-mid $2.20s. Midcon pipes were up a few cents to the $2.15 area. New York city gate gas firmed two to three cents to about the $2.60 area.</p>
<p>The NYMEX Henry Hub 12-month strip slipped 1.3 cents to $2.21. NYMEX said 45,701 contracts traded, up from Wednesday's revised tally of 31,368.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, August finished unchanged at $2.08, while deferreds ended narrowly mixed. The East/West spread widened by 0.1 cent to 9.5 cents (NYMEX premium). KCBT said 486 contracts traded, up from Wednesday's total of 365.</p>
