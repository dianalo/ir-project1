<p>Reigning Super 12 champions the Auckland Blues stamped their authority on the competition at the weekend with a confident 39-17 win over 1996 finalists Natal Sharks, while ACT showed they are the main Australian threat.</p>
<p>The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) side humiliated New South Wales 56-9 with eight tries in a sparkling display at Canberra's Bruce Stadium.</p>
<p>Auckland's win keeps the side at the top of the tri-national table with 35 points, four ahead of ACT, and the champions appear assured of a semi-final place.</p>
<p>ACT are also well-positioned to earn the right to host a semi-final but the Sharks and Wellington's Hurricanes are just four points, or one win, behind them on 27 points.</p>
<p>The Hurricanes, sporting a better score difference than Natal, have a game in hand over ACT and showed they could well chase the leaders right into the final by pounding a patchy Otago Highlanders side 60-34 on Saturday.</p>
<p>Wellington scored more than 50 points for the second week in a row, with All Black fullback Christian Cullen providing solid support with his kicking while robust winger Tana Umaga led the charge on the ground, scoring three dazzling tries.</p>
<p>The Natal Sharks can be reasonably proud of their performance in Auckland, chasing the home side hard for the first hour before being overwhelmed, but not so the other South African team in New Zealand at the weekend, the Gauteng Lions.</p>
<p>They took a cold bath in Christchurch, going down 23-0 to the Canterbury Crusaders on a waterlogged Lancaster Park.</p>
<p>Canterbury fly half Andrew Mehrtens made much of the play for his side but limped off towards the end with a groin strain that puts him in doubt for the Crusaders' next game against Northern Transvaal in Pretoria on Sunday.</p>
<p>The New Zealanders will then go on to play Free State as part of a two-match South African trip.</p>
<p>Other All Blacks on the injury list now include backs Alana Ieremia and Auckland's Adrian Cashmore, as well as long-term patient Jonah Lomu.</p>
<p>Wellington's Ieremia may be out for six weeks after breaking his collarbone on Saturday.</p>
<p>Injuries were the least of the worries for the other New Zealand side in the competition, the Waikato Chiefs, whose 27-13 loss to Free State in Bloemfontein on Sunday was their fifth in eight matches.</p>
<p>Free State recovered well from first half pressure by the visitors and their four tries earned them maxiumum points, leaving them as one of a trio with an outside chance of a semi-final place, the others being Canterbury and Gauteng.</p>
