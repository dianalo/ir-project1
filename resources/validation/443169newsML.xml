<p>OVER 20 KILLED IN BLAST NEAR PUNE</p>
<p>Over 20 people were killed and 50 injured in an explosion, triggered reportedly by gelatine sticks kept in a warehouse, in western Maharashtra. The blast, which took place in the evening, destroyed many houses within 100 meters of the ravaged warehouse. Most of the victims were farm labourers in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The Hindustan Times</p>
<p>MOTION ALLOWED ON UTTAR PRADESH CENTRAL RULE EXTENSION</p>
<p>The speaker of the lower house allowed the government to move a statutory resolution for extending President's Rule in Uttar Pradesh by six months beyond April 17. He overruled the Bharatiya Janata Party's objections and rejected their demand for summoning the Attorney-General to give his opinion on the constitutional validity of the measure. Following the ruling, the home minister moved the resolution.</p>

<p>INSTITUTIONS SEEK CAP ON ESCROW ACCOUNTS</p>
<p>Financial institutions have sought a cap on the escrow accounts being opened up by state governments to facilitate payments by the state power utilities (SEBs) to power developing companies. Since most SEBs have cash losses, private power companies are given first charge on fresh cash flows accruing to the SEBs through the escrow account.</p>

<p>ANNUAL CESS ON AGRICULTURAL LAND HOLDINGS PROPOSED</p>
<p>Farmers will be asked to pay an annual cess on their land holdings for the first time. Under the Agricultural Labour Bill, to be placed before parliament in April, all farmers owning more than one hectare of land would be eligible to pay the cess. The proceeds would be pooled into a welfare fund for farm labourers. The bill is expected to benefit more than 100 million agricultural labourers across the country.</p>

<p>The Economic Times</p>
<p>RELIANCE PAYS TAX FOR FIRST TIME</p>
<p>Reliance Industries (RIL) paid 500 million rupees to the income-tax department as tax for fiscal 1996/97 (April-March), for the first time in the 20 years since it went public. Reliance had surprised market watchers by not providing for tax in its six-monthly results, and generated a feeling that the company would somehow avoid paying tax for the current financial year. Company sources said the only objective behind paying the tax was to project RIL as a good corporate citizen.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>RAILWAYS TO LEASE OUT LAND, MAKE BOLT MORE ATTRACTIVE</p>
<p>The railways have proposed to lease out land, while retaining ownership rights, in a bid to overcome its resource constraints. There was also a proposal to give sops to attract private investments to the build-operate-lease-transfer scheme. This was indicated by the railway minister in parliament.</p>

<p>LENDERS GET CRUCIAL LEEWAY IN TELECOM VENTURES</p>
<p>The new tripartite agreement for basic telecommunications services operators has given lenders crucial powers. They will look for new licence holders if the original licence was cancelled, irrespective of whether default had taken place. Moreover, they would be compensated by the government for any such termination of licence. In the case of termination of a licence, the extent of unpaid dues would be determined by the lender itself, thus securing the chances of recovery almost completely.</p>

<p>ITDC WANTS SLOWDOWN IN DIVESTMENT</p>
<p>The India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) has urged the disinvestment panel to go slow on the proposed plan to further dilute government equity in the firm. The ITDC, in a presentation to the panel, said shares of ITDC hotels could fetch much higher prices if it was allowed to tie up with internationally renowned hotel chains. The panel also proposed selling stakes to the international hotel chains themselves, once they attracted disinvestment from international players in some select ITDC properties for upgradation and management.  </p>
<p>INDIAN PAPERS PLUMMET IN WORLD MARKET</p>
<p>Prices of Indian papers in the global market have crashed over the last fortnight. Global investment bankers believe the fall in prices was due to the Federal Reserve chairman's announcement that central bankers were ready to increase interest rates. Yields on three major papers have gone up 7-11 basis points since February 27. But the fall in prices of Indian debt papers in the secondary market was not a fallout of Moody's decision to put the country on its credit watch list.</p>

<p>RELIANCE BID FOR MUMBAI-PUNE EXPRESSWAY REJECTED</p>
<p>The Maharashtra government has rejected Reliance Industries' (RIL) 24 billion rupee Mumbai-Pune expressway bid. The expressway, with a lower projected investment of about 13 billion rupees, would now be completed by the State Road Development Corporation. The RIL-led consortium comprised Carter and Burgess of the U.S., Canadian Highway International Corporation, and Britain's DAR Consultants. The RIL proposal had sought a 12 billion rupee contribution from the state government for real estate development.</p>

<p>ITOCHU TO PICK UP PART OF NTT STAKE IN BASIC TELE SERVICES</p>
<p>Nippon Telephone &amp; Telegraph (NTT) will offload part of its 49 percent stake in Basic Tele Services Ltd (BTSL) in favour of Japanese trading giant Itochu Corporation, a minority partner in the consortium. BTSL holds the letter of intent for basic telephone services in Tamil Nadu. Itochu was expected to increase its stake in BTSL to more than 20 percent from 10 percent, with the RPG group retaining its 50 percent stake through holding company RPG Telephony.</p>

<p>ICICI PLANS GUARANTEE CORPORATION FOR CORE PROJECTS</p>
<p>The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) plans to set up a specialised corporation for providing guarantees to major infrastructure projects to enable them to source overseas debt funds. ICICI was in discussions with several players for the business. It has also sought the government's permission to set up the firm. The proposed non-banking finance company would be launched with a 500 million rupee share capital which could go up to one billion rupees.</p>

<p>FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR PHASED CONSOLIDATION OF ACCOUNTS</p>
<p>Financial institutions (FIs) want group companies to consolidate their financial statements and plan to implement the consolidation in phases. The FIs were forced to take an active stance on the issue as the working group redrafting the Companies Act recommended that consolidation of group accounts be at the option of the companies. FIs had recommended that companies with investments in other corporates at 35 percent and more should be consolidated into the parent company.</p>

<p>SERVICES IN JEOPARDY, SAY OPERATORS</p>
<p>Fixed-line telephone subscribers calling cellular phones in places other than the four metros would not need to dial a long distance code. This was a result of the recent negotiations between cellular phone operators and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). However, cellular operators considered it a small mercy which did not alter the fast-deteriorating situation. Cellular operators reported losing customers within months of commencing services in many states, after DoT ordered long-distance charges for fixed-line to cellular calls, even when these calls were made within the same city.</p>

<p>TORRENT POWER VENTURE WITH U.S. COMPANY</p>
<p>The Torrent group tied up with MCN Energy Group of the United States to form Torrent Power -- a project estimated to cost five billion rupees. MCN Energy would hold 40 percent of the firm's equity with a $56 million investment, while Torrent's equity of 60 percent would give it managerial and operational control in Torrent Power. The Torrent group's equity share would not come as currency investment, but would be in the form of assets it holds in three companies -- Ahmedabad Electricity Company, Surat Electricity Company and Gujarat Torrent Energy Corporation.</p>
