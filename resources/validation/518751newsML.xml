<p>Italian shares closed lower on Thursday after comments on EMU by Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer pushed bonds lower and were seized on as an excuse to take profits on stocks after a week of solid gains.</p>
<p>The all-share Mibtel index closed just above the day's lows at 12,332, a fall of 0.32 percent on the day while the Mib30 blue chip index ended 0.33 percent lower at 18,377.</p>
<p>Olivetti closed 3.11 percent lower at 502 lire, propelled downwards as some investors switched into the more buoyant Telecom Italia Mobile. Fiat and ENI both underperformed the index, closing 0.89 percent and 0.5 percent lower at 5,800 and 8,800 lire respectively.</p>
<p>Ambroveneto closed 6.61 percent higher at 4,359 lire, lifted by a flurry of speculation that savings bank group Cariplo may subscribe to a capital increase planned by Ambroveneto for later in the year.</p>
<p>Mediobanca and BCI rebounded after yesterday's sell-off prompted by a joint denial of plans to merge their operations.</p>
<p>&quot;People still believe in this because they reckon that a merger between the two banks would make a lot of sense,&quot; said a Milan-based stockbroker. Mediobanca closed 1.07 percent higher at 10,929 lire with BCI ending stable at 3,595 lire, below a session high of 3,630 lire.</p>
<p>Stefanel soared on rumours that textiles and publishing group HPI could be planning a bid. The casual clothes maker ended 9.57 percent higher at 3,287 lire.</p>
<p>Sentiment was helped by  confidence among investors that a tie-up with Calvin Klein will help boost business.</p>
<p>Edison ended 1.66 percent lower at 8,866 lire. The company announced a 38 percent jump in consolidated net profit to 370 billion lire just after the market closed.</p>
