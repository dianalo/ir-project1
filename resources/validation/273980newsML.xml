<p>France has medium-term growth potential of 2.5 to three percent, Bank of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet said in an interview published on Monday with afternoon daily Le Monde.</p>
<p>The government is forecasting growth this year of 1.3 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that we have the capacity to do better in the medium term -- 2.5 percent to three percent on average, per year, given the possible catch-up in growth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Trichet told a news conference last week that he believed France's medium-term growth potential was 2.5 percent or more.</p>
<p>Trichet repeated a call to French businesses to invest now as the best means of contributing to non-inflationary, job creating growth.</p>
<p>France also needed structural reforms to bring down unemployment, he said. &quot;We need structural reforms to make our growth richer in employment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some countries are doing better than us as regards unemployment, and there are lessons to be drawn in the United States and in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;But my personal feeling is that, in the end it is in continental Europe, in the Netherlands and Denmark, that we can draw the most lessons, because these countries have the same values as us...&quot; he said.</p>
<p>As regards the switch to the single European currency, Trichet said he did not expect any last-minute jostling to try to get a favourable exchange rate against the euro for national currencies.</p>
<p>&quot;For the future, I do not believe in the slightest bit in a parity war,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>This would have no sense and be counter to the Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;To join the single currency, you have to show you have had a stable currency in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Stability is measured in relation to the central rates in this mechanism.</p>
<p>&quot;All governments and all central banks believe that these central rates are in line with the fundamentals in the economies involved. Under these conditions, fixing parities will be done, in my opinion, in a perfectly natural and non-conflictual way,&quot; he said.</p>
