<p>Craig Consumer Electronics Inc said Monday that, on a preliminary basis, it had net income of about $56,000, or $0.02 cents per share, for the year ended December 31, 1996.</p>
<p>Net sales for the year ended December 31, 1996, were about $81 million, on a preliminary basis, the company said.  </p>
<p>Operating results for the year were adversely impacted by unusually high costs associated with the company's joint venture, the company said. This expense, it said, was due primarily to interruption of the venture's operations and other costs related to the start-up of the Chinese operations.</p>
<p>The company also said it experienced a greater-than-anticipated redemption rate attributable to fourth-quarter revenues associated with its consumer rebate programs.  </p>
<p>In connection with its annual audit for 1996, the company said it reassessed its accounting policy with respect to capitalizing certain costs in its Chinese production operations, undertaken through a joint venture with a People's Republic of China partner.</p>
<p>The company restated its quarterly results for the quarters ended June 30 and Sept. 30, 1996, as presented below.</p>
