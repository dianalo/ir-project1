<text>
<p>The Turkish parliament on Tuesday dropped an opposition censure motion against the troubled Islamist-led government.</p>
<p>&quot;Putting the censure motion...on the agenda has been rejected,&quot; deputy speaker Yasin Hatiboglu said after a vote.  </p>
<p>Deputies voted 272 to 265 in favour of dropping the motion brought by the leading opposition Motherland Party, which charged the government with giving civil servants unequal pay rises.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's coalition has faced mounting pressure after a warning from the military about increasing Islamists activities and signs of discontent from the conservative wing of the alliance led by Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.</p>
<p>However, Ciller earlier told reporters she would not abandon the coalition.</p>
<p>MPs were to vote later on whether to launch an inquiry into Justice Minister Sevket Kazan, a close aide of Erbakan and a member of his Welfare Party, over his Islamist activities.</p>
