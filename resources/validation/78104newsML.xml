<p>Gambians vote on Thursday in presidential elections intended to restore democracy in the West African state, but the young army officer who shot his way to power two years ago looks set to win the poll.</p>
<p>Military leader Yahya Jammeh is expected to vote early in the capital Banjul when polls open at 7.00 a.m. (0700 GMT). They close at 6.00 p.m. when the just over 440,000 registered voters are expected to have cast their ballots in 582 polling stations.</p>
<p>Jammeh toppled an elected government in a 1994 coup but international pressure forced him to speed up a transition to democracy, resigning from the army last month to seek election in a field including three civilian challengers.</p>
<p>If Jammeh wins, the military would have placed themselves in a position to shape the destiny of the West African nation of one million people for some time, political analysts say.</p>
<p>He is still the head of the military ruling council, some of whose members are the driving force of his party, the Alliance for Patriotic Orientation and Construction (APRC).</p>
<p>Jammeh has banned the main opposition parties and politicians close to the civilian leader he overthrew -- veteran president Sir Dawda Jawara, since exiled in Britain, which ruled Gambia until independence in 1965.</p>
<p>He has won praise from many Gambians for implementing visible social and infrastructure projects such as television, non-existent in Gambia until Jammeh took power. Jammeh has also improved electricity supply and built schools and hospitals.</p>
<p>Many Gambians expect the race to be close between him and prominent lawyer Ousainou Darboe of the United Democratic Party (UDP), who is backed by the a much larger tribe -- Jawara's Mandinka people forming 40 percent of the population.</p>
<p>Jammeh's Jola tribe accounts for only 10 percent.</p>
<p>But Jammeh appears to have made up for this with effective use of state power, including virtual monopoly of state media, notably television.</p>
<p>He gets about four hours of television exposure daily -- probably longer for state radio. Darboe and the two other opposition candidates are virtually excluded from state media.</p>
<p>The government justified this by saying they had misused their broadcast time by abusing Jammeh.</p>
<p>The other presidentianl contenders are Sidia Jatta of the small People's Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism, who stood against Jawara in 1992, and hotel manager Amath Bah of the National Reconciliation Party (NRP). Neither is expected to make a serious impact on the election.</p>
<p>The runup to election day has been marked by violent clashes between supporters of the two main rivals, during which the army and police were accused by Darboe of beating up his  supporters.</p>
<p>Electoral commissioner Gabriel Roberts issued a statement after the worst clashes last Sunday, calling on the army to show neutrality.</p>
<p>&quot;We repeat our call, issued at the beginning of the campaign for all soldiers to remain politically neutral,&quot; he said.</p>
