<p>Options on shares of Conrail Inc took the spotlight Thursday as the takeover battle between Norfolk Southern Corp and CSX Corp drew one small step closer to a finish.</p>
<p>The Conrail December 95 call was most active, with nearly 4,800 contracts changing hands. The December 105 call traded 3,450, the December 90 call about 2,750 and the December 100 call about 2,345.</p>
<p>Call premiums fell as the railroad operator's stock dropped 2-3/8 to 94-1/2 by 1400 CST (2000 GMT). Consolidated volume was roughly 11.5 million shares.  </p>
<p>The decline reflected the expiration of CSX's cash tender offer for the first 20 percent of Conrail's shares at $110 per share. The second part of the takeover is a stock swap.</p>
<p>Options traders said the successful tender also pushed call premiums lower.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a U.S. Court of Appeals denied Norfolk Southern's request for an emergency injunction blocking CSX's tender offer, which expired at midnight.</p>
<p>The appeals panel, however, agreed to consider Norfolk Southern's request for an expedited appeal of a federal court ruling on Tuesday rejecting its request to block the deal.  </p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon, Norfolk withdrew its motion for the expedited appeal.</p>
<p>Norfolk is pursuing a hostile $10 billion cash offer for Philadelphia-based Conrail. CSX's cash-and-stock offer is valued at $8.5 billion.</p>
<p>Conrail shareholders must now approve a key measure that would allow CSX to buy another 20 percent of Conrail.</p>
<p>Approval is necessary because Pennsylvania corporate law prohibits a company from buying more than 20 percent of another company in a cash tender offer.  </p>
<p>Many investors have expressed preference for the all-cash bid from Norfolk Southern, and options traders said Thursday the Conrail options activity indicates that some are expecting a sweetened offer.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like CSX is the winner, but it also looks like they're going to have to pay a higher price,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>He said the Conrail December 100 and 105 calls -- bought on the hope that Norfolk Southern's $110 per share bid would win out and drive the stock higher -- fell on CSX's successful tender offer.</p>
<p>CSX said the offer was oversubscribed.  </p>
<p>Active January calls also declined, led by the 95, which fell 7/8 to 3-3/8 on volume of about 680 contracts. The January 100 call fell 3/8 to two. It traded 380.</p>
<p>Among Conrail puts, the December 90 traded about 3,270 contracts. The option fell 9/16 to 13/16. The December 95 put traded 1,655 contracts and the December 85 put traded 1,220.</p>
