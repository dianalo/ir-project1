<p>A private Lebanese watchdog group denounced on Monday the &quot;high level&quot; of infractions and irregularities reported in the third round of Lebanon's parliamentary elections in Beirut.</p>
<p>The Lebanese Association for the Democracy of Elections (LADE), an independent group established in March to monitor the elections, said its monitors reported hundreds of violations in Sunday's round including buying votes for government candidates.</p>
<p>&quot;LADE denounces the continuingly high level of infraction and irregularities and intervention in the election process,&quot; the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>Campaigners at an electoral office of billionaire Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri -- heading a list of 17 candidates -- were seen by a Reuters reporter bribing voters.</p>
<p>Hariri's office denied the incident and accused rival candidates' supporters of making the payments.</p>
<p>&quot;The vote for the government list was being purchased at 100,000 Lebanese pounds (approximately $64),&quot; LADE reported.</p>
<p>LADE said official monitors of the main opposition list headed by ex-premier Selim Hoss were kicked out of some polling stations.</p>
<p>&quot;Also reported were thousands of omissions from the voters lists, long delays in the processing of corrections for these lists and hundreds of cases in which voters arrived to voting stations to find that someone else had already voted in their place,&quot; LADE said.</p>
<p>However, the group said that most of the infractions in Beirut were administrative and the level slightly lower than in previous rounds of voting in Mount Lebanon and North Lebanon.</p>
<p>Opposition candidates and LADE had alleged wide abuses in the first two rounds, when pro-government candidates swept aside all but three opposition candidates.</p>
<p>Christian opposition leaders seeking a political comeback were crushed in the first round of polling in Mount Lebanon.</p>
<p>But Sunday's bribery incident was one of the most serious of all alleged violations in the five-stage polls in which south Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa valley will vote on the two following Sundays.</p>
