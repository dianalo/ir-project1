<p>U.S. rail freight traffic rose modestly in the week ended October 19 from the same week a year ago, the Association of American Railroads said Thursday.</p>
<p>AAR said carloads in the week totaled 360,393, up 1.4 percent from 355,529 in the year-ago week. Intermodal traffic, which does not include carloads, stood at 171,779 trailers and containers, a 4.4 percent increase from 164,477 a year ago.</p>
<p>Ton-miles in the week also rose 2.3 percent to 26.9 billion from 26.3 billion last year. A ton-mile is equal to one ton of freight hauled one mile.  </p>
<p>Harvey Levine, AAR chief economist, noted that intermodal loadings were having a &quot;continued recovery&quot; from their slowdown in 1995.</p>
<p>Levine also said that grain loadings, which were up 2.5 percent from a year ago, saw &quot;the first increase from year-earlier weekly figures since the week ended April 13.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There have been predictions of a strong corn crop, and this could be a reflection of that,&quot; he added. Grain loadings totaled 28,179 in the October 19 week compared with 27,484 a year ago.  </p>
<p>AAR also noted that carloads of farm products other than grain rose 17.8 percent to 2,434 loadings from 2,067 a year ago, while petroleum increased 13.2 percent to 5,791 carloads from 5,114. It also said lumber loadings rose eight percent to 5,282 carloads from 4,890 last year.</p>
<p>The biggest decreases were in primary forest products which fell 11.3 percent to 7,663 carloads from 8,636 a year ago, and in food and kindred products which were down 7.5 percent to 8,572 carloads from 9,272 carloads in the same 1995 week.</p>
<p>In the first 42 weeks of 1996, AAR said ton-miles rose 1.9 percent from the same period last year. Intermodal traffic also rose 1.2 percent, but carloads fell 0.8 percent, AAR said.</p>
