<p>Hungarian farmers said they will restart roadblocks on Wednesday if the finance minister refuses to attend talks in Kiskoros, south Hungary.</p>
<p>Official news agency MTI reported that the leader of the protesters, Gyula Kosa, said the government did not keep its promise to continue talks in Kiskoros if necessary.</p>
<p>The farmers have blocked roads throughout the country with tractors, ploughs, harvesters and other equipment for most of last week.</p>
<p>They were protesting at the end of an exemption from social security contributions as of January 1 and new requirements to provide documentation for tax purposes.</p>
<p>After a preliminary agreement last Tuesday, the government sent its written proposal to the farmers on Thursday, accepting most of their claims.</p>
<p>On Friday, in reply to the government's letter, Kosa invited a government delegation for &quot;further talks&quot; in Kiskoros.</p>
<p>On Monday, Finance Minister Peter Medgyessy sent a letter to Kosa, president of a farmers' association formed last Friday, inviting him to interest coordination talks on Wednesday in Budapest, but a ministry official said neither Medgyessy, nor a government delegation will go to Kiskoros.</p>
<p>&quot;There is neither the possibility nor the time for separate talks with each interest group,&quot; Medgyessy said in his letter.</p>
