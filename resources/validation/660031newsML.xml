<p>Britain's new Labour government on Friday offered to mediate in peace talks between India and Pakistan, but only if both countries so desired.</p>
<p>&quot;If it is wished by the parties, we are willing to help in whatever way possible,&quot; Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett said on the third day of a five-day visit to India.</p>
<p>Fatchett said he had discussed Kashmir and human rights with Indian officials, and made clear Britain welcomed the resumption of talks between the South Asian arch-rivals.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that the recent initiatives of prime ministers I.K. Gujral and Nawaz Sharif will soon bear fruit,&quot; Fatchett said, referring to the leaders of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>The two leaders met last month in the Maldives. The fourth round of bilateral talks since negotiations resumed in March, this time between senior Foreign Ministry officials, will be held in Islamabad between June 19 and 23.</p>
<p>&quot;I have also repeated our offer of our good offices if that will assist the talks, and it is wished by the parties,&quot; he told a news conference, reading from a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;This in no way undermines our view that talks between the two governments offer the best way of resolving all the problems between India and Pakistan, including Kashmir.&quot;</p>
<p>The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan since they won independence from Britain in 1947. Two of the three wars the neighbours have fought have been sparked by differences over divided Kashmir.</p>
<p>India controls two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest.</p>
<p>Indian officials had expressed concern before Labour won Britain's recent election that it might press for outside mediation in the quarrel, which New Delhi says is entirely a bilateral matter.</p>
<p>Pakistan, citing a 1948 United Nations resolution, wants an internationally supervised referendum of Kashmiris to determine whether the region is folded into India or Pakistan.</p>
<p>Indian Foreign Ministry officials expressed relief after Fatchett held talks with junior Foreign Minister Kamla Sinha on Wednesday, saying Kashmir had not been high on his agenda.</p>
<p>Fatchett, asked if Labour was beholden to pro-Kashmiri separatist groups that backed the party at the polls, said the results showed &quot;Kashmir did not determine votes in the UK&quot;.</p>
<p>He said Britain would try to help India and Pakistan settle their differences only if they so wanted. He cited talks this week in London over the Western Sahara involving Morocco and the Polisario Front movement. &quot;What we are not saying is that we are imposing ourselves,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The British junior minister said Labour had consistently held that any long-term solution to the Kashmir dispute would have to have the consent of &quot;the peoples of Kashmir&quot;.</p>
<p>Delhi strongly opposes a proposal by Kashmiri separatists that they take part in tripartite talks with India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>He also said a solution would have to take into account U.N. resolutions as well as the 1972 Shimla accord in which India and Pakistan vowed to resolve differences through bilateral talks.</p>
<p>Fatchett said he had decided not to go to Jammu and Kashmir, mostly Hindu India's only Moslem-majority state, on this trip.</p>
<p>&quot;We are at a sensitive stage,&quot; he said, referring to the talks between India and Pakistan. &quot;It would be wise to help the negotiations to leave these matters to the bilateral discussions between India and Pakistan. We in no way wanted to make the issue more difficult. It's difficult enough.&quot;</p>
<p>Fatchett thanked India for its help in trying to trace four Western hostages kidnapped in Kashmir nearly two years ago, including two Britons, but said they were still missing.</p>
<p>The British minister was scheduled to go to Bombay later on Friday and to Pakistan on Sunday.</p>
