<headline>Jamaica orders arrest of singer Sade.</headline>

<text>
<p>A Jamaican court has ordered the arrest of popular singer Sade if she returns to the island.</p>
<p>The warrant was issued when the singer failed to appear in court on Monday to face charges of dangerous driving.</p>
<p>The Nigerian-born Sade, whose real name is Helen Folasade, failed to appear in court on June 25. When the case was recalled on Monday, she had a new attorney who explained she was in London caring for her sick daughter.</p>
<p>But the judge said there was nothing to indicate from the report provided by a London hospital when her daughter was admitted or underwent surgery for a dog bite, and he was not satisfied the singer was unable to attend court on June 25.</p>
<p>The singer, famous for jazz-tinged ballads such as &quot;Smooth Operator&quot;, was charged on Feb.27 in Montego Bay after she failed to obey a policeman's stop order. Another officer gave chase and she was arrested and released on J$5,000 (US$140) bail.</p>
<p>Sade has lived in the Ocho Rios area since last year.</p>
