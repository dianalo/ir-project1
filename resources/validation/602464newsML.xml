<p>Canada's merchandise trade surplus expanded in March to C$3.12 billion from C$2.45 billion in February (revised from C$2.19 billion), Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The agency said exports to the world and to the United States hit records in March.</p>
<p>    MERCHANDISE TRADE   Mar 97  Feb 97   Mar 96</p>
<p>    Exports		 23.71    23.62    21.66</p>
<p>    Imports		 20.60    21.16    18.72</p>
<p>    Trade balance	 +3.12    +2.45    +2.93</p>
<p>Note: Figures in billions of current Canadian dollars, on a balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of economists had forecast a surplus of C$2.3 billion in March, with exports of C$24.2 billion and imports of C$21.9 billion.</p>
<p>    YEAR-TO-DATE TRADE		1997	1996</p>
<p>    Exports			     70.88     65.30</p>
<p>    Imports			     63.18     57.07</p>
<p>    Trade balance		     +7.70     +8.22</p>
<p>Statistics Canada said exports to the world were at a record high in March at C$23.71 billion, surpassing a record set just a month earlier in February, at C$23.62 billion. Exports to the United States also set a record at C$19.49 billion, surpassing the previous record in February 1997 at C$19.40 billion.</p>
<p>The trade surplus was well below the record set in May 1996 for C$3.80 billion, Statistics Canada said.</p>
<p>The federal agency said exports of industrial goods and agricultural products made solid gains in the month. But growth in total exports, up a modest 0.4 percent in March, was tempered by reduced sales of energy products and automobiles, especially to the United States.</p>
<p>So far in 1997, exports have increased to all of Canada's amjor trading partners except the European Union, the federal agency said.</p>
<p>Increased demand from U.S. manufacturers helped boost industrial goods exports by 13.2 percent in March, as 21 of 27 commodity groupings showed improvement over February, StatsCan said.</p>
<p>In agricultural exports, up 6.2 percent, gains were posted for most commodities, led by Japanese purchases of canola and sales of meat and vegetable products to the United States.</p>
<p>Exporters of forestry products increased their shipments for a second consecutive month in March, up 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>Imports declined for the second consecutive month in March, dipping 2.7 percent to C$20.6 billion. The decline reflected weaker imports for most commodity sectors, StatsCan said.</p>
<p>However, total imports remained 3.2 percent above the most recent low in December, the agency said. While imports from the United States and Japan advanced during this period, there were declines from all other trading partners.</p>
<p>Imports of machinery and equipment fell marginally in March, down 1.9 percent, following two months of sustained high levels, Statistics Canada said.</p>
<p>Energy imports fell for a second consectuvie month in March as purchases in all major commodity groupings lost ground, the agency said.</p>
<p>Industrial goods and consumer imports both retreated from record highs in February, with 10 of 17 product groups declining.</p>
<p>Automotive procucts helped offset some of March's import slippage, moving ahead 0.6 percent, StatsCan said.</p>
