<p>Avenor Inc said on Tuesday it expects asset sales totalling C$850 million after completion of its proposed takeover of Repap Enterprises Inc.</p>
<p>Avenor plans to make the divestitures of certain assets to reduce debt after its all-stock offer for Repap, a transaction that will be put to a vote of Avenor stockholders on March 12.</p>
<p>&quot;Avenor expects that the gross proceeds from all planned dispositions will be realized within 18 months and will exceed C$850 million,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>Detailed information is contained in a management circular filed jointly by Avenor and Repap on Monday on the offer.  </p>
<p>Avenor said plans to proceed with divestitures of non-core assets and realize cost savings from operating and tax synergies.</p>
<p>Planned non-core asset divestitures include the Repap Manitoba kraft paper mill and Repap and Avenor operations in British Columbia, Avenor said. Repap's Alcell and Atholville operations will be divested as part of the initial transaction.</p>
<p>Avenor will apply the proceeds from divestitures, increased profits from the realization of synergies and all other free cash flow towards debt reduction, it said.  </p>
<p>Avenor plans to integrate Repap's coated paper operations in Miramichi, New Brunswick and Kimberly, Wisconsin with its Dryden and Thunder Bay, Ontario mills. Overall operating synergies are estimated at C$128 million per year, once fully implemented by the end of 1998, it said.</p>
<p>Avenor plans to limit its capital spending to ongoing maintenance and high return projects, and plans to reduce working capital by an estimated C$50 million over two years.</p>
<p>Avenor said its prime strategic goal is to progress from being a commodity producer operating in mature markets to a flexible producer of high value grades targeted at growing market segments.</p>
<p>Repap's coated paper business provides Avenor with immediate access to competitive modern production capacity, technical expertise and established customer relationships in a market that has higher profit margins, less volatile pricing and better growth prospects, Avenor said in the circular.</p>
<p>The acquisition will give Avenor the opportunity to generate more value from its northern softwood fibre base in Eastern Canada, the company said.</p>
