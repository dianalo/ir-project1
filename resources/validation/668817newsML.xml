<p>European Union leaders, buoyed by success after resolving a potentially explosive row over unemployment, on Wednesday faced tough negotiations on a new treaty to open the way for the bloc's eastern expansion.</p>
<p>Ministers said much of the treaty, which is designed to streamline the EU's complex decision-making process, had already been agreed but some sensitive issues still had to be settled, such as defence and foreign policy commitments.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still a number of differences...the devil is in the detail,&quot; Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo told reporters. &quot;But things are going forward in an extremely optimistic atmosphere.&quot;</p>
<p>EU leaders appeared in ebullient mood after patching up a huge policy divide between Germany's desire for strict budget discipline ahead of the launch of the single European currency, and France's demand for job-creation schemes.</p>
<p>In a classic EU deal, leaders issued a resolution putting economic growth and employment at the top of their political agenda while at the same time sticking to plans demanding fiscal austerity for European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>They also indicated they would hold a special summit in Luxembourg later this year to study ways of putting some of Europe's 18 million unemployed back to work.</p>
<p>&quot;There are only winners. No losers,&quot; Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm said after the resolution was agreed.</p>
<p>With the row behind them, EU leaders immediately returned to work on the new treaty, which has been under discussion for 15 months, racing against the clock to strike an agreement before the two-day summit ends on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>&quot;Many things are having to be decided at the 11th hour and there are worries that we won't be able to do it all in time,&quot; Greek Deputy Foreign Minister George Papandreou said.</p>
<p>The EU has promised to open negotiations with a host of central and eastern European states eager to join the powerful trading bloc within six months of the new treaty being signed.</p>
<p>Ahead of the planned expansion, a number of states are pressing for greater flexibility -- the EU buzzword for the concept of allowing some countries to forge closer ties at a faster rate than others.</p>
<p>Britain, worried that this might create a two-speed Europe, says it wants individual member states to have a veto over such plans, but the Germans are adamantly opposed to this.</p>
<p>One of the most contentious issues still to be confronted was demands from a number of countries, including the major continental powers, to merge Europe's fledgling defence arm, the Western European Union, into the EU.</p>
<p>Pitted against them are the British, who want NATO to remain the cornerstone of the West's military operations, and neutral states such as Ireland and Sweden.</p>
<p>&quot;These are largely irreconcilable positions,&quot; the Dutch foreign minister warned.</p>
<p>Problems were also expected over planned changes to EU voting procedures, with some governments fighting to limit the ability of single states to veto EU projects and introduce instead a majority voting system.</p>
<p>&quot;If we perform like this today with just 15 countries in the union, imagine what it would be like with 20 countries. It would be utter paralysis,&quot; Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi told a news conference.</p>
