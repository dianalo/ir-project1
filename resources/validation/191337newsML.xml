<p>New York precious metals futures ended off the day's lows Friday as silver recovered late in the session, after the complex opened lower for the second day in a row.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been some more producer selling in gold today, as well as some fund selling,&quot; Credit Suisse New York vice president Ian MacDonald said.</p>
<p>&quot;Your're likely to see more producer selling on the way back up, and the funds don't have much reason to reverse their record short positions yet,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;But on other hand gold doesn't seem to want to go much below $378-380, so we may be going to trade a range for a while,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>COMEX December gold closed down 70 cents at $381.10, after recovering partially from intraday lows at $379.80.</p>
<p>Spot gold in the bullion market ended quoted $380.05/380.55, compared to the London afternoon fix Friday at $379.25 and the New York close Thursday around $381.00/381.40.</p>
<p>Gold sold off Thursday, bringing to an end a six day recovery from 18 month lows at $376.80 seen in late October.  </p>
<p>Open interest in the December gold contract, along with total COMEX gold open interest, fell heavily again Thursday, suggesting funds were covering some of their record net short positions on dips toward $380, or fabricators were lifting some of their large long hedge positions, analysts said.</p>
<p>Total gold open interest fell 7,290 lots Thursday to 174,038 contracts, the lowest level since early September.</p>
<p>The spot gold/silver ratio slipped to 76.94 at the close from 78.58 at Thursday's close as silver recovered faster than gold late in the day on trade buying, analysts said.</p>
<p>COMEX December silver closed up 9.8 cents unchanged at $4.938, after recovering from a session low at $4.820.</p>
<p>Total COMEX silver open interest fell 892 lots Thursday to 93,093 lots.</p>
<p>NYMEX January platinum closed unchanged at $389.50 an ounce, after trading in a $387.50-389.50 range.</p>
<p>December palladium ended up 15 cents at $120.50.</p>
