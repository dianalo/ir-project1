<title>USA: No Christmas shopping for U.S. astronaut.</title>

<p>U.S. astronaut John Blaha will spend Christmas away from his family on Russia's Mir space station -- but at least he's avoided shopping for presents.</p>
<p>&quot;This year I haven't had to worry about getting Christmas presents for anyone down on the planet,&quot; Blaha, 54, said in a satellite news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p>His wife Brenda helped by finding gifts for his two Russian crewmates, Valeri Korzun and Alexander Kaleri.</p>
<p>&quot;A couple of days before launch, I asked her to run down and get me a couple of Christmas presents,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>As Blaha spoke from space with reporters in Florida and Texas, a spacesuit glove clutching a miniature Christmas tree floated in the Mir cabin.</p>
<p>Blaha, who is three months into a fourth-month stay on Mir, received a batch of gifts from his family last month, delivered to the station by an unmanned cargo craft.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, the 54-year-old astronaut will talk with his family in a video linkup and will tuck into an international Christmas dinner.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to have an outstanding menu,&quot; Mir commander Valeri Korzun said. &quot;A menu that will include both Russian and American products. We will have traditional cakes, lamb, pork and a wonderful desert as well as Italian food -- macaroni cheese.&quot;</p>
