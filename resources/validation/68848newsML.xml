<p>The TWA jet that erupted in flames in July over the Atlantic was used for a bomb training operation that could have left traces of explosives found by investigators, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Packages containing explosive chemicals were put on board the Boeing 747 in the past year as part of a training exercise for bomb-sniffing dogs, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement.</p>
<p>The test packages were removed from the Boeing 747 when the training exercise ended, sometime in the past year, the FBI said.</p>
<p>Those explosives would not have caused an explosion to destroy the plane, said Shelly Hazle, a spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is leading the investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;They only used bomb-making materials,&quot; she said. &quot;They weren't planting bombs and didn't leave one on board.&quot;</p>
<p>The Paris-bound TWA Flight 800 exploded without warning in midair on July 17 off the coast of Long Island, New York, killing all 230 people on board.</p>
<p>Investigators seeking the cause of the deadly crash have found microscopic chemical traces of two types of explosives in the wreckage but have said they lack sufficient evidence to declare that a bomb destroyed the plane.</p>
<p>They have been puzzled by the lack of physical evidence of a bomb, such as distinctive scarring or so-called pinging, on the wreckage.</p>
<p>&quot;This could discount the traces that were found,&quot; the NTSB spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The FBI did not say what types of explosives were used in the dog-sniffing tests or precisely when they were carried out. Investigators have said privately that the chemical traces they found in the wreckage were of PETN and RDX, both prime ingredients in the plastic explosive Semtex.</p>
<p>Investigators maintain there are three possible explanations for the crash -- a bomb, a missile or a mechanical failure -- but this latest revelation could diminish the possiblity that it was a bomb.</p>
<p>TWA spokesman John McDonald said from the airline's headquarters in St. Louis that the airline could not confirm that the plane was used to test bomb-detection dogs.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't received information that in fact that's what happened,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy and Coast Gaurd have been recovering the plane's debris from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, and investigators have been reassembling the wreckage in an old aircraft hangar in Calverton, New York.</p>
<p>Investigators also have travelled to London to look at a mock-up of Pan Am Flight 103, which blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 killing 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground.</p>
<p>The bodies of 213 of the 230 victims on Flight 800 have been recovered.</p>
