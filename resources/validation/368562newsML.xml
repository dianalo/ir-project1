<p>Texas Instruments Inc said that by targeting higher growth markets with a range of new products in the coming year, the company can drive operating profit margins into the high teens in its core &quot;differentiated&quot; semiconductor business from its current level in the low-teens.</p>
<p>&quot;That's our target over the next year or so,&quot; Bill Aylesworth, chief financial officer, said of his &quot;high-teens&quot; operating margin target.  </p>
<p>Aylesworth was referring to comments he made during a question and answer session before an audience of money managers attending the Goldman Sachs Technology Symposium here Tuesday afternoon. An audience member had asked what the company's goals for operating profit margins were looking out toward 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of TI is really going to be driven by our differentiated semiconductor business,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The higher profit margin goals apply to TI's core digital signal products (DSPs) and related businesses, or two-thirds of its semiconductor sales, which in turn account for 80 percent of total corporate revenues, he said.</p>
<p>He cautioned that operating profit margins will continue to vary in its other businesses and that its Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) computer memory chip will continue to act as a drag on overall corporate profit margins.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's pretty hard to forecast what the DRAM cycle is going to be,&quot; and its impact on TI's own memory chip business, he said.</p>
<p>He declined to offer a forecast for profit margins for the company as a whole.  </p>
<p>Aylesworth said TI's DRAM business remains in a significant loss position due to the widely noted industry collapse in memory chip pricing in 1996, when DRAM pricing fell roughly 80 percent.</p>
<p>He said a return to profitablity in memory chips, Texas Instruments' second largest contributor in terms of revenues, will not occur until demand once again outstrips supply, driving up DRAM product prices.</p>
<p>Noting the historic bust-to-boom cycle of the industry, he said the scarcity of investment in new plant capacity already is hastening the return of supply shortages.  </p>
<p>Reflecting the historic volatility of the memory chip market, Aylesworth argued that the DRAM business can not be expected to have stable operating margins. He said the company has attempted to share the risks and rewards of its DRAM business through a series of joint ventures with key customers.</p>
<p>He said that as part of a program to introduce greater financial stability in its overall results, the company is working with partners to &quot;refine&quot; these ventures to further reduce TI's exposure to DRAM pricing declines.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our objective is a return on invested capital that is much greater than our cost of capital in our DRAM business,&quot; he explained.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs semiconductor analyst Rajiv Chaudhri said he was pleased with the company's comments about expanding margins in its core semiconductor operation.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a very agressive forecast,&quot; he said, referring to the operating margin growth goal in the &quot;high-teens&quot; for TI's core semiconductor business. &quot;We are not budgeting that into our models right now.&quot;  </p>
<p>Texas Instruments stock is currently listed on Goldman's U.S. recommended list. Chaudhri has projected the company will see $3.25 per share in earnings for the 1997 fiscal year rising to $4.50 per share in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;What really pleased me about what (TI officials) said in their presentation is that they are setting ambitious goals for the company once again,&quot; Chaudhri said.</p>
<p>He attributed the new aggressiveness to senior management changes in the past year and accelerating new product introductions, especially in its high-growth digital signal processor business.</p>
