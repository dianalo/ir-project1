<p>Dutch consumer spending will probably slow down in 1997 from the robust rates seen this year, but GDP growth will continue at a steady clip as a recovery in other European countries stimulates exports, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;We think there will be a slowdown in consumer spending to around 2.25 percent next year,&quot; said Nico Klene of ABN AMRO.</p>
<p>But this would be offset by a strong contribution to growth from investment and exports, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a recovery in Europe, mainly in Germany, and therefore we think Dutch exports will grow more quickly.&quot;  </p>
<p>Data released on Thursday showed a real increase of 3.0 percent in Dutch gross domestic prouct (GDP) for the third quarter of 1996 compared with the same period of 1995.</p>
<p>Third quarter consumer spending rose 3.2 percent, with the durable goods component rising 7.0 percent.</p>
<p>Klene said consumer spending for the whole of 1996 would show a real increase of around three percent.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO had estimated real Dutch GDP growth for 1996 at 2.5 percent but was considering raising this figure in the direction of its 1997 GDP growth forecast of 2.75 percent, he said.  </p>
<p>Paul van de Ven of Rabobank said he expected real Dutch GDP growth of 2.75 percent this year and a 1997 figure not much lower. &quot;The fundamentals are very good. We expect a substantial contribution from exports next year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chemicals would probably be one of the first sectors to benefit from a recovery in Germany and other European countries and was often a leading indicator for other sectors, he said.</p>
<p>Employment growth was set to slow but would pick up again in the second half of 1997, helping to support consumer spending. But overall consumer spending was likely to grow at around two percent in 1997 versus three percent in 1996, Van de Ven said.  </p>
<p>Both Klene and Van de Ven noted that growth of consumer spending in 1996 had outstripped the modest rise in real disposable incomes this year.</p>
<p>They said consumer spending had been propped up in 1996 by a mix of factors including postponement of purchases from last year, lower savings ratios this year and increased borrowing as consumer confidence had gradually recovered.</p>
<p>Van de Ven said the surge in spending on durable goods was due in part to purchases of home furnishings financed through mortgage loans, adding that consumer confidence had risen in tandem with an improvement in the Dutch labour market this year.</p>
