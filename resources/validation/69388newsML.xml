<title>USA: Consumers and refiners squeezed by high oil price.</title>
<headline>Consumers and refiners squeezed by high oil price.</headline>

<p>Oil companies may again come in for criticism as gasoline prices turn up, but refiners are also being punished by the surge in oil prices in recent weeks, analysts say.</p>
<p>Though the major integrated oil companies make up on high oil prices what they lose on the refinery margins, those in the industry specialising on the &quot;downstream&quot; or refining and marketing end of the market are feeling the pinch.</p>
<p>&quot;These are not the worst gasoline margins, but they are certainly one of the worst,&quot; said David Zinamon, director of refining and environmental affairs at consultants Petroleum Industry Research Associates.</p>
<p>Some of those companies heavily skewed toward gasoline refining are Chevron Corp., Valero Energy Corp., Diamond Shamrock Inc., Sun Co. and Tosco Corp., analysts said.</p>
<p>The margin squeeze can be seen on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), where gasoline futures prices have lagged badly behind the 16 percent rise in crude oil prices since early August.</p>
<p>This week, gasoline's premium above the U.S. benchmark crude oil West Texas Intermediate fell to $2.25 a barrel -- the lowest level since October, 1994. The premium has averaged around $5 over the past two years.</p>
<p>The reasons for the dismal gasoline margins is that refiners have been increasing their overall runs to produce more heating oil, which has seen its premium skyrocket to nearly $5 as inventories dwindled to historically low levels ahead of winter.</p>
<p>&quot;They are going to try to lean toward making distillate (mainly heating oil) as much as possible but ... for gasoline output this will be hard,&quot; said Linda Abramo, analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc.</p>
<p>United States refineries generally are geared up to produce twice as much gasoline as heating oil from a barrel crude oil.</p>
<p>The pressure on gasoline margins is likely to remain in place for some months, made worse by the fact that Europe is facing a similar situation.</p>
<p>With heating oil stocks there also running well below typical levels, European refineries also are producing a larger surplus of gasoline.</p>
<p>&quot;We see maybe a little blip up in October or November due to tensions between Iraq and the U.S. dying down, but we don't expect it to improve that much after that,&quot; said Abramo.</p>
