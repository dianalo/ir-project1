<p>Cedenco Foods Ltd on Thursday said it had virtually completed its major restructuring and was forecasting a return to profitability in the year to September, 1997.  </p>
<p>Managing director Dean Witters said the establishment of Cedenco Australia and the restructuring of Cedenco's remaining operations had resulted in significant one-off costs and a substantial revision to its balance sheet for the financial year to September 30, 1996.</p>
<p>Cedenco expects a full year loss of NZ$6.1 million for that year, including an operating loss for the final six months of $1.8 million (before tax) and the effect of the one-off restructuring costs and associated write downs.</p>
<p>As a result fixed asset values and debt levels are both expected to fall significantly.  </p>
<p>As Cedenco began its new financial year, however, restructuring left it better placed to capitalise on its technical expertise in the growing, processing and industrial marketing of specialist food products.</p>
<p>Witters said the establishment of Cedenco Australia gave the company a secure base in its principal market, Australia, alongside its major customers.</p>
<p>Cedenco Australia, a joint venture with Cerebos Australia, will be Australasia's largest tomato processing operation.  </p>
<p>Cedenco's state-of-the-art tomato paste and dice processing plant, being erected on site in Victoria after shipping to Australia, will be ready to process its first tomato crop in early 1997.</p>
<p>Cedenco Australia will supply 40 percent of the Australian tomato paste market and has already entered into contracts with customers covering the majority of its expected production.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, Cedenco plans to expand and diversify its Gisborne operations, including the production of vegetable powders, fresh vegetables and its nursery operations.</p>
