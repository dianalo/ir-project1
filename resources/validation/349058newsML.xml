<p>The new Central Depository Company of Pakistan Ltd (CDC), which will computerise share deals, is expected to boost activity by overseas investors, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said the CDC, established in an ordinance issued by President Farooq Leghari earlier this week, would eliminate much of the grumbling by overseas investors over delays in registering transfers.</p>
<p>Analysts said it should cut the transfer of share ownership to just a few days, if not less. Under the current system, it takes around 45 days.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a good news to foreign investors, who used to grumble over delays in the transfer of names on actual share certificates,&quot; said one analyst who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>&quot;The greatest benefits of the CDC are efficient delivery, settlement, transfer of securities and transactions through the computerised book entry system,&quot; Arif Habib, chairman of the CDC told Reuters.</p>
<p>The necessity of the CDC was felt after a sharp rise in trading of stocks among foreign and local investors on the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE), said Habib, who is also president of the bourse, Pakistan's biggest.</p>
<p>Turnover on the KSE has risen to 40 million shares a day from just one million a few years ago, said an analyst at Kausar Abbas Bhayani Securities.</p>
<p>Software for the CDC's system has been installed and should be operational by the end of March. It should be functional for transfer of securities by May 1, Habib said.</p>
<p>The CDC works on an electronic book entry system to record and transfer securities and it changes ownership of securities without any physical movement of certificates or the necessity for the execution of transfer deeds.</p>
<p>The CDC would eliminate the current need to count, verify, store and transport countless certificates.</p>
<p>Habib said 25 companies would be included in the CDC in the first phase and more would be added later. He did not say how many or over what period.</p>
<p>The government had also reduced the stamp duty on transfer of shares to the CDC to 0.1 from 1.5 percent in the 1996/97 (July-June) budget, Habib said.</p>
<p>&quot;Institutional investors, as well as individual investors, will benefit from this move as it will reduce their costs and increase their incentive to deposit their shares with the CDC.&quot;</p>
