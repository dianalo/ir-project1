<p>Bahrain and Qatar on Sunday agreed to open embassies for the first time in an apparent attempt to improve strained relations between the two Gulf Arab states entangled in a territorial dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;Manama and Doha agreed to set up embassies in both countries to further coordination and cooperation between them,&quot; Bahrain's official Gulf News Agency (GNA) said.</p>
<p>It said the agreement came during a meeting in Manama between Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammad bin Mubarak al-Khalifa and his Qatari counterpart Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani.</p>
<p>The Qatari foreign minister arrived in Manama earlier on Sunday in a bid to ease tensions between the countries.</p>
<p>GNA said he met Bahrain's Emir Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa and discussed &quot;close relations between the two brotherly countries.&quot;</p>
<p>The territorial dispute is centred on Gulf islands controlled by Bahrain since the 1930s but also claimed by Qatar.</p>
<p>Relations between the two Gulf Arab allies worsened last year after Bahrain arrested, tried and later freed two Qataris on spy charges. Qatar also accused Bahrain of masterminding a foiled coup attempt in Doha last year.</p>
<p>Gulf Arab reconciliation efforts have failed to ease tensions between Manama and Doha.</p>
