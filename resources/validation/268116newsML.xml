<p>The U.S. trade gap narrowed sharply in October as overseas sales of aircraft surged, the Commerce Department said Thursday, though the bilateral deficit with Japan jumped to the highest level in more than a year.</p>
<p>The overall trade deficit shrank 30.2 percent to $7.99 billion from a revised $11.44 billion in September -- the lowest monthly deficit in seven months since $7.87 billion in March.</p>
<p>Exports of all types of goods and services increased 4.2 percent in October to a record $71.74 billion, while total imports contracted 0.7 percent to $79.72 billion.</p>
<p>The resulting October trade deficit was well below Wall Street economists' expectations of a $10.4 billion shortfall.</p>
<p>&quot;The trade deficit definitely was much narrower and it points to stronger growth, suggesting maybe up 2.5 to 3.0 percent growth, with exports leading the way,&quot; said Astrid Adolfson, first vice president and an economist at MCM Moneywatch Inc. &quot;... It supports the view that the economy is stronger going into 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>The smaller gap owed much to a ballooning of aircraft exports, which more than doubled in value to $1.75 billion in October from $759 million in September. Department officials said it was the highest monthly value for aircraft exports in 2-1/2 years, since they were at $2.1 billion in April 1994.</p>
<p>Imports of automobiles and parts from Canada were lower because a strike against General Motors Corp. plants affected production, which helped shave the monthly import total by about $1 billion.</p>
<p>But the politically sensitive deficit with Japan shot up by 30.9 percent to $4.96 billion in October, the highest level since $5 billion in August 1995.</p>
<p>That made Japan once again the country responsible for the largest single part of the U.S. deficit, barely surpassing the $4.90 billion deficit with China.</p>
<p>Even so, the department noted the monthly deficit with China was up for a seventh straight month, likely aggravating trade tensions with the Asian trade giant as imports from it hit a record $5.8 billion.</p>
<p>The department said the key reason for the escalating deficit with Japan was higher imports of cars and parts. U.S. manufacturers charge Japan is deliberately manipulating its currency to keep the yen's value low and make its products cheaper for American importers.</p>
<p>&quot;That was partly a seasonal factor,&quot; said David Sloan, senior economist at I.D.E.A. Inc. &quot;The figures for Japan are not seasonally adjusted and they always widen in October because of the new model year in autos.&quot;</p>
<p>Japan on Wednesday reported its November trade data, which suggested more trouble ahead for U.S. attempts to shrink the trade shortfall. Japan's surplus on trade with the United States swelled 30 percent last month from a year earlier to $3.31 billion as a cheaper yen helped fuel Japanese exports.</p>
<p>The United States typically runs a surplus on its trade with other countries in services like travel and tourism that partly offsets big merchandise trade deficits.</p>
<p>In October, the merchandise deficit decreased 19.6 percent to $14.09 billion from $17.52 billion in September. The surplus on services increased slightly to $6.10 billion from $6.09 billion in September.</p>
<p>The cost of imported crude petroleum rose to $4.81 billion in October from $4.77 billion in September even though the volume of barrels imported was down.</p>
<p>The price per barrel of imported crude kept climbing to $21.38 -- the highest since January 1991 during the Gulf War against Iraq -- from $20.02 in September.</p>
<p>Before the report was released, analysts said a strong dollar that made U.S. exports more expensive for foreigners, together with economic weakness among key trade partners in Europe and Japan, was likely to complicate efforts to bring the U.S. monthly deficit down from lofty levels over the longer term.</p>
<p>The U.S. trade deficit with Western Europe swelled by 75 percent during October to $1.82 billion from $1.04 billion in September.</p>
<p>But the shortfall with Canada, the United States' single largest single trading partner, fell 20.1 percent to $1.55 billion. That improvement may prove temporary, since the strike against GM has been settled and imports of autos and parts from Canada are certain to pick up.</p>
