<title>GERMANY: GERMAN CALL MONEY EASES AFTER BUBA INJECTS FUNDS.</title>
<headline>GERMAN CALL MONEY EASES AFTER BUBA INJECTS FUNDS.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-08-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>German call money rates eased to 3.08/3.10 percent on Wednesday after the Bundesbank injected a net 400 million marks into the money market with its repo allocation.</p>
<p>The prevailing rate on Tuesday had been 3.125 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers had expected the Bundesbank to inject up to three billion marks on Wednesday but said market conditions appeared to have warranted a smaller injection.</p>
<p>Dealers said data for Tuesday showed liquidity had risen. Also, banks were more ready to sell cash after the Bundesbank set this week's tender at a steady fixed rate of 3.00 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;Banks have changed their behaviour,&quot; one money dealer said. &quot;After the Bundesbank made liquidity available at three percent for a further 14 days those banks that have hoarded money are more willing to put funds on the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Before Tuesday, when the Bundesbank set this week's tender at three percent, banks had withheld funds from the market because they thought the Bundesbank may signal it wanted a higher repo rate in defence of the mark.</p>
<p>But Tuesday's announcement allayed those fears and banks' deposits at the Bundesbank -- a measure of market liquidity -- rose sharply to 41.0 billion marks from 39.7 billion.  </p>
<p>The average for the month through Tuesday rose to 39.8 billion marks from 39.7 billion. Lombard borrowings were negligible.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt Interbank Overnight Average (FIONA) was 3.12933 percent on Wednesday, down from 3.14867 percent on Tuesday.</p>
