<p>Several people were injured when two suspected bombs exploded inside Britain's Northern Ireland army headquarters at Lisburn, near Belfast, on Monday.</p>
<p>Police said the explosions occurred inside the perimeter of the British base and security sources said they believe the explosions were caused by bombs.  </p>
<p>Ambulances rushed to the scene and black smoke hung over the base, some 10 miles (16 km) south of Belfast, where a large proportion of the 18,000 British troops in Northern Ireland is based.</p>
<p>Police said no bomb warning was given by any of the province's rival guerrilla groups.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland has been largely immune from violence since rival guerrilla groups called ceasefires in 1994 but the Irish Republican Army (IRA) went back to war against British rule with attacks on British mainland targets in February.</p>
