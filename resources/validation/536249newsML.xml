<headline>Italy elections could cap month of gloom for Prodi.</headline>

<p>Italians vote on Sunday in their largest numbers since last April's general election in local polls that could deliver more bad news for Prime Minister Romano Prodi's troubled centre-left government.</p>
<p>The elections for mayors and councils in 1,115 towns and cities, including the big northern cities of Milan and Turin, will be the first real test of voter support since Prodi led his Olive Tree alliance to national victory a year ago.</p>
<p>About one-fifth of Italy's electorate is eligible to vote, with results due late on Monday.</p>
<p>Though political analysts say local considerations will sway many voters, they say the picture that emerges from the test will inevitably weigh on the national political scene.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever the intentions of the people in how they vote, that is how the results will be interpreted,&quot; said Sergio Romano, one of Italy's most respected political commentators.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a game they (the political parties) conceived themselves and they cannot extricate themselves from it.&quot;</p>
<p>Opinion polls have been banned in the run-up to voting but one of the most recent surveys published, on April 7, showed Prodi's popularity at its lowest since his election victory.</p>
<p>The poll by the Explorer group for La Stampa newspaper also indicated that the centre-right Freedom Alliance would win a general election were it to be held now.</p>
<p>It attributed both verdicts to public gloom at the belt-tightening Prodi has inflicted on Italians on his crusade to squeeze Italy into Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>A special 1997 &quot;Euro-tax&quot; to help reduce the budget deficit to the three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) required for euro membership is now beginning to bite.</p>
<p>Government protestations that the sacrifice is worth it were dealt a blow on Wednesday when the European Commission forecast that Italy's revenue-raising measures would trim the 1997 deficit to only 3.2 percent of GDP -- not enough to qualify.</p>
<p>The forecast has increased pressure on the government to act to cut welfare spending, including generous pensions, in an exercise that is certain to be deeply unpopular with Italians.</p>
<p>The hard left party Communist Refoundation, which ensures Prodi his parliamentary majority, is resisting the cuts and has sought to raise its profile by running alone in Sunday's local elections rather than in alliance with the Olive Tree.</p>
<p>The party flexed its muscles this month by opposing Prodi on the deployment of an Italian-led security force to Albania, pitching his coalition to the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>How its vote shapes up could influence forthcoming coalition negotiations on the welfare reforms, political analysts say.</p>
<p>Voting on Sunday in the mayoral races in larger towns and cities will be the first of two rounds, with the two top contenders entering a run-off on May 11 in places where no candidate wins an absolute majority.</p>
<p>The races in Milan, Italy's financial capital, and industrial Turin are both expected to go to a second round, with as much focus on who drops out as on who stays in.</p>
<p>The spotlight is on Milan, where incumbent Marco Formentini of the separatist Northern League stands to lose his job to either Gabriele Albertini of the centre-right Freedom Alliance or Aldo Fumagalli of the Olive Tree.</p>
<p>The loss of Milan would be a blow to League prestige though some commentators say Formentini could make it to the second round, with Fumagalli risking defeat on the first round in what would be a slap in the face for Prodi's alliance.</p>
