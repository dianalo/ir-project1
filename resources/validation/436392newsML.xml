<p>King Hussein of Jordan warned on Wednesday of a violent response from Palestinians if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went ahead with plans for a Jewish settlement around Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;I think if it happens there is a very strong chance of violence,&quot; King Hussein told the Cable News Network (CNN) channel in an interview.</p>
<p>He said there was &quot;an air of crisis&quot; over peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis and said Palestinian President Yasser Arafat had been reduced to a state of &quot;complete despair.&quot;</p>
<p>The king, speaking before leaving for Spain and the United States, said he was troubled that Netanyahu did not listen to his warnings of an explosion of violence which the Israeli Prime Minister's policies could cause.</p>
<p>&quot;It does trouble me very seriously and I think I have a duty to speak the truth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The king, Netanyahu's closest Arab ally, sent a sharply-worded rebuke to the Israeli leader this week saying he could no longer consider him a serious peace partner.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel very strongly that things are not moving in the right direction, or fast enough, and we are sliding towards the possibility of despair and extremism that might come with it and violence,&quot; he told CNN. &quot;This is a situation which is intolerable.&quot;</p>
<p>He repeated Jordan's opposition to any construction around Jerusalem that could preempt decisions on the status of the city due to be agreed in the last stage of Palestinian-Israeli talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very clear in our minds that there should be no change whatsoever in the status quo until such a a time as the people discuss it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;My misgivings are (that) there is a growing lack of trust and certainly the worst part of it all is that the Palestinians seem to be humiliated and you cannot humiliate a people and continue to do it without having any reaction,&quot; the king said.</p>
<p>He said he had learned from Arafat that a number of Palestinian ministers &quot;were wondering whether to continue.&quot;</p>
