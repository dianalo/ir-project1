<p>China on Tuesday said attendance would be optional at the July 1 swearing-in of a controversial Beijing-backed legislature for Hong Kong, after U.S. officials said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would shun the event.</p>
<p>Albright plans to attend a ceremony to mark the return of Hong Kong to China after 156 years of British rule, but not the inauguration of members of the Provisional Legislature that will replace the territory's current elected chamber.</p>
<p>Attendance would be optional at the midnight June 30 handover ceremony and also the later swearing-in of new Hong Kong leaders, officials and legislators, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai.</p>
<p>&quot;For these activities...(we) have invited some international guests,&quot; Cui told a news briefing in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;Who will attend and what activities they attend, is of course up to them to decide,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Britain and its Western allies have attacked the new assembly, questioning its legitimacy and the need for it to replace the democratically elected Legislative Council.</p>
<p>The 60-strong provisional assembly, which has met so far in China because of doubts about its pre-handover legality, is packed with pro-Beijing politicians and businessmen picked by a China-controlled committee six months ago.</p>
<p>In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Albright, who will be a guest at the handover, would not go to the later swearing-in.</p>
<p>&quot;I can tell you if she were invited, she would not attend that ceremony...because it wouldn't be appropriate,&quot; Burns said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have never believed that the appointment of a provisional legislature is justified or necessary,&quot; he said.</p>
