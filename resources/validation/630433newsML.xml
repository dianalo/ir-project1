<p>U.S. oil company Atlantic Richfield Co (ARCO) swept the board Monday buying two adjacent oil fields of the five on offer during the first day of Venezuela's third round of oil operating contracts auctions.</p>
<p>In association with Venezuela's Inelectra and powerful local foods group Polar Uno, Arco first paid $60 million for the Kaki field in eastern Venezuela. Its bid -- flashed on a wall- sized screen -- drew ohhs and claps from the tense and crowded auditorium.</p>
<p>The consortium then won the neighboring Maulpa field contract for $61.37 million, beating the nearest bid by a solely Venezuelan consortium by some $3 million.</p>
<p>&quot;There were two fields this consortium wanted to win,&quot; Arco president Jay Cheatham told reporters. After some &quot;very rigorous calculations ... we won both and there's much synergy between them.&quot;</p>
<p>Cheatham did not comment on projected production from the Maulpa field, which currently pumps 1,580 barrels per day from proven reserves of 119 million barrels, according to state oil company PDVSA figures.</p>
<p>But he said much exploration was planned and that investment would be several times higher PDVSA's required $5 million spread over three years.</p>
<p>Neighboring Kaki field, which currently produces 600 bpd from reserves of 135 million, has a minimum required investment of seven million.</p>
<p>Both contracts run for 20 years, with the consortium producing oil for PDVSA subsidiary Corpoven in exchange for a fee worked out on a sliding scale.</p>
<p>&quot;We're very happy,&quot; Cheatham said.</p>
<p>A total of 131 companies are competing for 20 contracts to be sold this week with the winners determined purely by the size of their bids.</p>
