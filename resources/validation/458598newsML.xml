<title>CANADA: Canada presses U.S. on diverting flood waters.</title>
<headline>Canada presses U.S. on diverting flood waters.</headline>
<dateline>OTTAWA 1997-03-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy has said he will continue to press the United States not to allow a diversion of flood waters from North Dakota north to Manitoba.</p>
<p>But, in a letter to Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon, he noted there was no threat this year of flood waters being sent north. The letter was sent on Thursday and a copy was received by Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>Filmon had written of his concern over a bill being debated by the U.S. Congress that might allow disaster relief funds to build an outlet at Devils Lake to relieve flooding in the Missouri River Basin.</p>
<p>The water would flow into the Red River and its tributaries and on into the Hudson Bay. The area around the Red River already suffers regular springtime flooding, and Canadian officials worry about adding to the water as well as the transfer of organisms from one basin to another.</p>
<p>Officials say there is a 10 percent chance the Red River valley could see the worst flood of the century.</p>
<p>&quot;Our position remains one of opposition to any feature of Devils Lake or the Garrison Diversion which has the potential to affect Canadian or Manitoban waters,&quot; Axworthy wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the United States to meet its commitments under the Boundary Waters Treaty by not creating threats to the quality of Canadian border waters.&quot;</p>
<p>Axworthy told Filmon the Canadian embassy in Washington has raised the Devils Lake issue frequently with the U.S. State Department. He said he had raised the issue last year and again in February and would bring it up again in Washington in April.</p>
