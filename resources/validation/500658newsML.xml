<headline>J.P. Morgan Q1 paced by strong trading.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>J.P. Morgan &amp; Co Inc's better-than-expected 1997 first quarter earnings were paced by strong trading results.</p>
<p>The company said market risk positioning and its capital and liquidity management revenues rose 28 percent from a year ago to $276 million.</p>
<p>Higher trading revenue was partially offset by lower net interest revenue from investing activities due to the maturing of higher-yielding investments. Total return in proprietary investing and trading, including net unrealized appreciation, was $365 million versus $106 million a year ago.  </p>
<p>J.P. Morgan said revenue in its finance and advisory business, including debt and equity underwriting, rose eight percent in the first quarter to $451 million, with a 61 percent increase in revenue from debt and equity underwriting in both developed and emerging markets.</p>
<p>Advisory revenue declined 26 percent from the first quarter of 1996 when the firm collected fees from several large transactions.</p>
<p>Revenue from global credit activity rose nine percent to $230 million, reflecting increased loan syndication activity.  </p>
<p>J.P. Morgan said in its market-making business, revenues totaled $733 million, down from $771 million. The company said most markets showed strength early in the quarter, but activity slowed in mid-March as a result of a shift in U.S. monetary policy.</p>
<p>Fixed income revenues of $264 million in developed markets fell from the strong first-quarter 1996 level of $456 million. Revenues in the 1996 first quarter benefited from gains on positions arising from client-related swap transactions. Overall, the volume of client transactions grew but the number of higher-yielding, customized transactions fell.  </p>
<p>In emerging markets, revenues rose nearly 50 percent to $186 million, as a result of short-term positioning gains and greater client demand, J.P. Morgan said.</p>
<p>Market making revenues in equities rose 63 percent to $152 million, as a result of strong demand in both the cash and derivative markets. Equity derivative revenues grew 64 percent, and equity commissions were up 47 percent, reflecting higher volumes and growing market share, primarily on U.S. and European exchanges. Foreign exchange revenues rose 78 percent, with strong client demand in active markets. Commodities revenues were $12 million, down from $31 million a year ago.  </p>
<p>In its asset management and servicing business, J.P. Morgan said revenues rose 9 percent to $375 million in the first quarter. Revenues generated from institutional investment management activities and services for private clients increased 13 percent to $243 million. Assets under management grew 15 percent from a year ago to approximately $213 billion at March 31, 1997, due to net new business and, to a lesser extent, market appreciation.</p>
<p>Operating expenses were up 10 percent from 1996 to $1.191 billion, reflecting investments in areas targeted for growth and higher levels of business activity, J.P. Morgan said.  </p>
<p>Overall, J.P. Morgan's first quarter revenue rose five percent to $1.83 billion and net income was $424 million, down from $439 million a year ago. Net income per share was $2.04, down from $2.13 a year ago.</p>
<p>The consensus estimate on First Call for the 1997 first quarter was $1.92 per share.</p>
<p>The firm purchased $555 million of common stock in the open market during the first quarter of 1997, following a  December 1996 authorization to purchase up to $750 million of shares. The firm also continued its program of purchasing stock to lessen the impact of employee benefit plans.</p>
