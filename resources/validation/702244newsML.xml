<p>Firefighters on Wednesday battled a stubborn blaze that charred more than 1,500 acres of the Angeles National Forest overnight.</p>
<p>One home and two outbuildings were destroyed. One resident of the area a few miles north of downtown Los Angeles suffered a heart attack, and an elderly couple suffered a &quot;panic attack&quot; when they were temporarily trapped in their home, officials said.</p>
<p>A firefighter was taken to the hospital with heat exhaustion.</p>
<p>U.S. Forestry Service spokeswoman Rita Nolan said the fire was expected to burn through the long Independence Day weekend.</p>
<p>She said the blaze was started by a homeowner using a weed-whacker to clear brush around his residence -- a practice encouraged by the forestry service and local fire departments.</p>
<p>&quot;In this case the weed-whacker hit a rock and that created a spark that started the fire,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Firefighters fought the blaze from the air and on the ground. Smoke from the fire drifted over downtown Los Angeles and local freeways during the morning rush hour.</p>
