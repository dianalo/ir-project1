<p>Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who reached the highest age ever documented in a human being, died on Monday aged 122 years and 164 days at her retirement home in the Provencal town of Arles.</p>
<p>Calment, who enjoyed wine, chocolate and the odd cigarette until the end in defiance of medical advice, died in mid-morning of an unspecified cause, according to doctors at the Du Lac home where she spent her last 12 years.</p>
<p>Born on February 21, 1875, when Lenin was five years old, she was a living link back to a time without cars, telephones, movies or aircraft. Her life spanned the rule of 20 French presidents.</p>
<p>&quot;We will never forget this marvellous, great lady,&quot; said President Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>&quot;I will always remember the freshness of her spirit, her occasionally biting humour, her tenderness and her generosity...Her secret was to remember only the best moments and forget all the others,&quot; Chirac said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;She occupied an important place in our history and in our hearts,&quot; added Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.</p>
<p>Though blind, virtually deaf and confined to a wheelchair, the frail, diminutive woman remained lucid and kept her cheerful sense of humour to the end. She used to say that a smile was her recipe for long life.</p>
<p>&quot;I've only ever had one wrinkle and I'm sitting on it,&quot; she once remarked. &quot;I will die laughing.&quot;</p>
<p>Arles was in mourning, said mayor Michel Vauzelle.</p>
<p>&quot;She was the living memory of our town. She brought us comfort and hope with her liveliness, humour and tenderness. In short, we had hoped she was immortal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Guinness Book of Records listed her as the oldest person who ever lived and had a birth certificate to prove it.</p>
<p>Calment reached 120 years and 238 days on October 17, 1995, passing the oldest ever authenticated age of 120 years and 237 days at which Japan's Schigechiyo Izumi died in 1986, according to the book.</p>
<p>It dismissed rival claims for lack of documentation, including a former Brazilian slave, Maria do Carmen Geronimo, who celebrated her 125th birthday last March.</p>
<p>French media said that following Calment's death, the oldest living person was now Christian Mortensen, a Danish-American due to celebrate his 115th birthday on August 16 at a retirement home in San Rafael, California.</p>
<p>Calment outlived her husband Fernand Calment who died in 1942 -- four years before their golden wedding anniversary -- as well as her daughter who died in 1934 and her grandson, a doctor who died in 1963.</p>
<p>&quot;God must have forgotten me,&quot; she once said.</p>
<p>Born into a well-to-do family 10 years after the assassination of U.S. president Abraham Lincoln, she met Vincent Van Gogh as a girl when the artist came to shop at her father's art supplies store.</p>
<p>She described Van Gogh as &quot;ugly as a louse&quot; and &quot;boorish and impolite. I ran the other way&quot;.</p>
<p>Calment reached 65, retirement age, the year France was invaded by Hitler's Nazis in 1940, and was 70 when French law allowed her to vote for the first time.</p>
<p>&quot;Jeanne Calment's longevity is due to genetic factors. Her ancestors generally lived incomparably longer than the average,&quot; said geriatric physician Bernard Forette.</p>
<p>Her resilience kept her riding a bicycle until 100.</p>
<p>On her 121st birthday in 1996, the &quot;doyenne of humanity&quot; launched an improbable career as a pop artist, issuing a compact disc entitled &quot;Mistress of Time&quot; on which she spoke to a backing of funk-rap, techno and dance music.</p>
<p>Calment famously trumped a lawyer who gambled in a 1965 property deal that he could inherit her home cheaply.</p>
<p>When Calment was 90, Andre-Francois Raffray, then 47, agreed to pay her 2,500 francs ($400) a month until she died, on condition he would inherit her house in Arles, a system common in France.</p>
<p>Raffray died in 1995, aged 77, having paid Calment more than 900,000 francs ($143,000) over 30 years -- three times the value of the house. &quot;We all make bad deals in life,&quot; she remarked on her 120th birthday.</p>
