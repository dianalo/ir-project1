<headline>BT says planned MCI merger no threat to UK service.</headline>

<p>British Telecommunications Plc's proposed merger with U.S. telecom giant MCI will not threaten investment and services in Britain, BT's chief told politicians on Monday.</p>
<p>Chief executive Peter Bonfield also denied the merger would offer BT a backdoor route into the satellite television market.</p>
<p>&quot;The merger is aimed at gaining economies of scale on a global basis and an opening into the U.S. market. But the UK remains a major part of our investment plan,&quot; he told parliament's Trade and Industry select committee.</p>
<p>BT's planned merger with MCI still has to gain regulatory approval from the United States, Britain and the European Union.</p>
<p>But a written testimony from BT to the select committee said the company did not see the merger giving rise to any significant regulatory issues. It expects the planned $20 billion merger to be cleared by European and American regulators by this autumn.</p>
<p>Bonfield added that the UK telecommunications regulator, Oftel, would ensure BT discharged its licence obligations within Britain after any merger.</p>
<p>He said the merger would help keep the costs of BT's telecom network down and would therefore benefit British consumers.</p>
<p>BT announced last October that it planned to buy the 80 percent of MCI that it does not already own. The new group, to be called Concert Plc, aims to service multinational companies end-to-end and be represented in all the world's key nations.</p>
<p>The Trade and Industry select committee also took evidence from the Cable Communications Association which raised some fears about the BT/MCI merger.</p>
<p>It noted that MCI holds a sizeable minority stake in Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the parent company of satellite television firm BSkyB.</p>
<p>&quot;The cable industry is therefore concerned that this link may serve to cement the already burgeoning relationship between BSkyB and BT,&quot; it said in a deposition to the select committee.</p>
<p>But Bonfield denied BT was using the MCI merger as a roundabout route into the satellite market. BT is barred from using its network for entertainment services.</p>
<p>&quot;We regard it as a passive stake,&quot; he said. &quot;The conspiracy theory is not a good one.&quot;</p>
<p>Bonfield also made a plea for BT to be allowed greater access to entertainment markets, now closely allied to telecommunications through satellite and digital terrestrial television.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking for a bit more certainty of regulation,&quot; he said. &quot;To have this restriction does potentially distort competition and will affect future investment plans.&quot;</p>
<p>The speed of technological change in the market demanded a fresh look at the regulatory framework, Bonfield said.</p>
<p>A decision to end the ban, taken next year and put into effect by 2001 would be &quot;along the right lines,&quot; he said.</p>
