<p>The victorious South African Springboks left Paris on Sunday looking ahead to what they regard as the ultimate test -- the Tri-Series in the southern hemisphere next season.</p>
<p>&quot;The Springboks have been very successful,&quot; said coach Andre Markgraaff of a tour in which South Africa have won four tests, two in Argentina and two in France -- including Saturday's 13-12 second test victory -- with an unchanged side.</p>
<p>&quot;But we won't see the result until next year in the Tri-Series,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>South Africa, rebuilding after their World Cup triumph on home soil last year, regard their arch-rivals New Zealand and Australia along with themselves as the three best sides in the world.</p>
<p>Springboks assistant coach Nick Mallett said: &quot;I saw a very good French team, very different to that in Bordeaux (which lost the first test 22-12).</p>
<p>&quot;France are still the fourth team in the world,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Before Saturday's decisive test, Markgraaff had said: &quot;We are playing for our future in the second test. If we win the series in France, we will have proved, in South Africa, that we're on the right track. We need this second win against France to start 1997 on the right foot.&quot;</p>
<p>The results obtained by southern hemisphere teams currently touring Europe are ample proof, if it was still needed, of where the game's power base lies.</p>
<p>South Africa, Australia, Western Samoa and the New Zealand Barbarians -- virtually the All Blacks -- have all enjoyed significant successes in Europe in the last month.</p>
<p>Only the amateur Argentine Pumas look likely to cede a win to Europe when they face England at Twickenham on Saturday.</p>
<p>The French, at a precarious stage in their rebuilding for the 1999 World Cup, could not find the answers to South Africa's extremely efficient although not revolutionary game.</p>
<p>This is galling for the French who regard the touring team as quite beatable and feel they could have won if they had not been deprived of at least six key players through injury.</p>
<p>But they have recognised that the Springboks are brilliant at their game based on the power of their forwards and crunching tackling in defence.</p>
<p>&quot;A Springbok on the field means tackle, tackle, tackle,&quot; said Mallet.</p>
<p>Markgraaff, however, is wary of the limitations of South Africa's game when it comes to the crunch encounters with their southern hemisphere rivals.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not exactly how we want to play but the players want to win and that's what is most important on tour.&quot;</p>
<p>The French have taken heart from a much improved performance after their poor showing in Bordeaux last weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;What we must hold on to is the team's capacity to recover on a mental level,&quot; said manager Jo Maso. &quot;If one day we manage also to steady and develop our game, we'll have a great team.&quot;</p>
<p>Coach Jean-Claude Skrela said: &quot;We were perfect as far as the challenge was concerned but we lacked tactical lucidity.&quot;</p>
<p>He particularly criticised his team's poor tactical kicking in open play.</p>
<p>France will need to work hard on their game with newly acquired young players like promising wing Laurent Leflmand, who won his first cap on Saturday, for the Five Nations tournament next year in which holders England start as favourites.</p>
<p>Giant number eight Abdelatif Benazzi, who took over the captaincy from injured wing Philippe Saint-Andre, said: &quot;The (Five Nations) tournament is coming up and we must relearn our basics.&quot;</p>
