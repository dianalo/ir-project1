<p>Asia Satellite Telecommunications Holdings Ltd said on Friday it has sold almost all of its interest in a satellite leasing company, First Asian Satellite Leasing Ltd Partnership.</p>
<p>Asia Satellite sold to an undisclosed, independent third party 99.01 percent of its interest in First Asian, being 99 percent of the equity in First Asian.</p>
<p>It also sold the benefit of 99 percent of an interest-free loan of HK$99.97 million to be repaid by First Asian to Asia Satellite, the company said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Asia Satellite sold First Asian to receive cash for general working capital purposes and to transfer the company's obligation to pay all but one percent of any future tax on the profit of First Asian to the purchaser.</p>
<p>First Asian is a limited partnership, whose principal activity is to own all the transponders and telemetry, tracking and control equipment of and related to the Hughes HS376 satellite &quot;AsiaSat 1&quot; which is operated by Asia Satellite.</p>
<p>After completion of the transaction, AsiaSat 1 will continue to be leased to Asia Satellite.  </p>
<p>First Asian had audited pre-tax profits of HK$4 million for the year ended June 30, 1995 and HK$3.93 million in 1996. The tax liabilities in those years were HK$11.06 million and HK$14.19 million.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, the gross consideration payable before expenses will be about US$6.48 million in cash, payable in full on completion.</p>
<p>The net book value of the partnership interest, based on the company's audited accounts as at December 31, 1996, was about HK$103.19 million, the notice said.  </p>
<p>Details of the transaction will be sent to shareholders on May 22, the notice said.</p>
