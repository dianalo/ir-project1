<headline>INTERVIEW - RMC sees German pressure into 1997.</headline>

<p>British building materials giant RMC Group, which reported a steep first-half loss earlier on Thursday, warned that German sales pressure could continue into 1997, although the second half will show some improvement.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, chief executive Peter Young said: &quot;In Germany we would not expect the volumes in the second half to be as badly down as in the first half. But I don't want to be too optimistic. There may be a slight decline in volumes of one or two percentage points (in 1997).&quot;  </p>
<p>The German market is critical to RMC's fortunes. In 1995 Germany accounted for around 40 percent of profits and sales for the group.</p>
<p>But this year German sales have fallen sharply, hit by bad weather conditions and weak demand as the government tightens its fiscal stance.</p>
<p>Young said the UK housing market pick-up was just beginning to feed through to the new house sector, though he tempered his optimism by saying: &quot;It will not be a bonanza. But there will be some improvement.&quot; On the French outlook, Young said it would &quot;remain at the bottom&quot;.  </p>
<p>RMC reported a a 26.5 percent slump in half-year pretax profits to 95.8 million stg, which Young said was in line with analysts' expectations after the spring profit warning.</p>
<p>Turnover slid five percent to 2.11 billion stg, but the dividend rose five percent to 7.8 pence.</p>
<p>The group said the second-half results were likely to be more satisfactory, but warned that the full year figures would not match the record levels enjoyed in 1995.</p>
