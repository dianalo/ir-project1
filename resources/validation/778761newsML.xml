<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury on Tuesday said the Church of England would be thrown into crisis if divorced Prince Charles remarried.</p>
<p>George Carey, in Australia on a two-week tour to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Australian Anglican Church, said the fact Charles had divorced Princess Diana posed no obstacle to the throne. But the issue of remarriage was very different.</p>
<p>&quot;All that Prince Charles has to be is the next heir to the throne,&quot; Carey told a news conference. &quot;So the very fact that he is divorced is not an issue at all.</p>
<p>&quot;Now it is true that remarriage would create a crisis for the church -- this is well known,&quot; Carey said.</p>
<p>But he added that as far as he knew, Charles had no plans to remarry.</p>
<p>As king, Charles would become the head of the Church of England which disapproves of remarriage after a monarch's divorce. Carey is the church's spiritual leader.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to say again, Prince Charles has said he has no intention of remarrying,&quot; said Carey who has previously refused to comment on the effect of a possible marriage between Charles and his long-time lover, Camilla Parker Bowles.</p>
<p>British newspapers have speculated that Charles may be planning to marry Parker Bowles.</p>
<p>Many Britons blame her for the break-up of Charles's 15-year marriage to Diana and say they could never accept Parker Bowles, who is also divorced, as their queen.</p>
<p>One British newspaper has reported that Charles has promised his mother Queen Elizabeth that he would not risk a constitutional crisis by forcing the issue.</p>
