<headline>AIC says Cargill slow with gas oil nominations.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Trading house AIC, the main short on the November IPE gas oil contract, said on Friday that Cargill, the main long, was behind on its nominations for the second five-day delivery window.</p>
<p>An AIC spokesperson said Cargill was 38 percent short on its nominations in the Amsterdam area and 60 percent short on its nominations in the Antwerp area.</p>
<p>&quot;They are falling short on the amount they need to pick up ... If they are running short on nominations then how can we load their oil?&quot; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>He added that Cargill had indicated that it intended to lift 260,000 tonnes in the second 21-25 period that ends on Monday but it had a total of only five barges presented to its installations in Amsterdam and Antwerp for loading under the second window.</p>
<p>A spokesperson at Cargill's Minneapolis headquarters was not immediately available for comment. A Cargill trader in Geneva had no comment.</p>
<p>AIC earlier in the week said Cargill had failed to lift the required volume of gas oil in the first five-day period of the November 16-30 delivery window.</p>
<p>Cargill, in apparent reponse to that charge, said on Thursday there had been some problems in the first five-day delivery period but it hoped to resolve these through IPE channels. It added it was confident the IPE would resolve any dispute in a prompt and just manner.</p>
<p>Cargill is due to take delivery of at least 627,800 tonnes, of which a third each is due to be lifted in the three five-day periods, November 16-20, November 21-25 and November 26-30.</p>
<p>European gas oil traders have condemned the duel being fought between the two companies, saying it has sapped liquidity, disrupted supply patterns and damaged the IPE's price discovery function.</p>
