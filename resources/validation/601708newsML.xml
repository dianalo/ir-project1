<p>A volcano in western Nicaragua spewed clouds of smoke and ash high into the air on Wednesday, causing authorities to declare an alert for the peasants living nearby.</p>
<p>The 5,724-foot (1,745 metres) San Cristobal volcano started rumbling on Tuesday but authorities insisted there was no immediate danger to residents in the area, which is about 94 miles (150 km)  southwest of the capital Managua.</p>
<p>Officials at the government Institute for Territorial Studies (INETER) said the volcano would probably belch lots of smoke, some lava and possibly rocks in coming days but said a massive explosion was probably not imminent.</p>
<p>&quot;That can't be predicted, but it's unlikely,&quot; said one INETER official. &quot;A strong eruption with a lot of activity is Specialists were tracking the volcano's activity from a special permanent observation post four miles (seven km) away from San Cristobal.</p>
<p>In the town of Chinandega, 12 miles (20 km) from the volcano and close to the border with neighbouring Honduras, an emergency committee declared an alert on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>It warned inhabitants to cover water supplies to prevent ash contamination and to watch out for fresh instructions.</p>
<p>Official Radio Nicaragua said members of the committee were inspecting the foothills of the volcano to identify possible evacuation routes and to take a census of the peasants who farm corn and beans in 10 nearby communities.</p>
