<headline>Somerfield retreats after in-line H1 result.</headline>

<p>Shares in Britain's Somerfield Plc retreated from recent gains on Tuesday after the supermarket operator posted first-half results, its first since flotation last August, which were no better than analyst expectations. The stock was down 5p at 169 by 1053 GMT in moderate volume of 1.5 million shares.  </p>
<p>Dealers and analysts said there was scope for profit-taking after the stock's recent strong run. Yesterday Somerfield shares set their highest close since flotation, ending up 3p at 174p.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it was better to travel than arrive, but people who bought at 150p and rode it up have got a nice return,&quot; said David Stoddart, analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.</p>
<p>&quot;But given that the background in the industry is no worse than it has been for a while it is hard to see why Somerfield should suffer particularly,&quot; Stoddart said. &quot;Refurbishments are still producing good returns and there is more to come, and the stock is not expensive however you measure it.&quot;  </p>
<p>Stoddart said there was no reason to believe local supermarket operators such as Somerfield -- as opposed to those who have expanded out-of-town -- could not prosper.</p>
<p>Yet others said Somerfield's results showed the company continued to lag the sector's leaders, arguing that they compared poorly with yesterday's trading statement from blue chip Tesco Plc.</p>
<p>&quot;We would still avoid Somerfield,&quot; said one sales trader, &quot;they are still struggling and compared with Tesco, Somerfield is still a different quality stock than the leaders.&quot;  </p>
<p>Somerfield said pre-tax profit rose to 54.6 million stg in the six months to November 9 from 43.0 million a year before, compared with analyst expectations mostly in a range between 52.5 million stg and 56 million.</p>
<p>Sales rose 1.3 percent to 1.7 billion stg while operating margins rose to 3.4 percent from 2.8 percent a year before. The company said it would pay a first-half dividend of 3.4p per share.  </p>
<p>Chief executive David Simons said the results demonstrated a &quot;very significant improvement&quot; in operating ratios. With 74 percent of trading space converted to the Somerfield format from Gateway, he said the company was well placed to improve its competitive position.</p>
