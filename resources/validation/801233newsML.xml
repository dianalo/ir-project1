<title>SINGAPORE: SINGAPORE FOREIGN SHARES FALL ON ST TRANCHE MERGER.</title>
<headline>SINGAPORE FOREIGN SHARES FALL ON ST TRANCHE MERGER.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-08-14</dateline>

<p>The foreign tranches of shares in a range of Singapore blue chip companies fell swiftly in early trade on Thursday following news that the government-owned Singapore Technologies (ST) group would merge the foreign and local share tranches of four of its units.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile the local tranches of the same shares rallied.</p>
<p>Foreign tranches traditionally hold a premium over local tranches because they can be bought by any investor and tend to be much more volatile.</p>
<p>Scrapping of the split between the tranches would remove this price differential.</p>
<p>By 0125 GMT, Singapore Press foreign  was down 90 cents at Singapore $25.50. Its local tranche was up 40 cents at S$13.40.  </p>
<p>ST said on Wednesday four of its listed units would merge their foreign and local share tranches from Thursday.</p>
<p>The four are ST Shipbuilding and Engineering, ST Electronics &amp; Engineering, ST Automotive and ST Aerospace.</p>
<p>The mergers came after a decision by ST Computer Systems &amp; Services to merge its share tranches last Friday.</p>
<p>Singapore Technolgies had said earlier it would support the merger of the tranches &quot;so long as they are beneficial to all shareholders in the long term&quot;.  </p>
<p>The split tranche system was originally introduced to protect companies that were considered to be strategically important to Singapore. Companies with split tranches include the banks, defence groups and other strategic firms.</p>
<p>But the government already owns large chunks of these companies and dealers say the split share system is often inefficient.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody concerned has realised it is not necessarily desirable to either the companies or their shareholders,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;It is a bit clumsy.&quot;</p>
