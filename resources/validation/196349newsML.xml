<p>COLES MYER IN FOR INTERESTING AGM</p>
<p>Coles Myer shareholders will meet today at the company's annual meeting.</p>
<p>It's been a year full of scandals, sackings and falling profits for Australia's biggest retailer which last month declared it had recorded its worst earnings performance in years.</p>
<p>And that revelation is likely to urge discussion on the two-point-eight-million dollar salary of chief executive, Peter Bartels.</p>
<p>The top order of business, however is expected to be the re-election of former Chairman of the board, Solomon Lew as a director.</p>
<p>Last year, Mr Lew was ousted over the so-called &quot;Yannon transaction.&quot;</p>
<p>His failure to disclose his role in Yannon, which cost Coles Myer 18-million dollars, has prompted a major firm advising the board to recommend that he not be returned.</p>
<p>It's believed a voting block of the company's three major shareholders including Mr Lew, will be enough to get him elected.</p>

<p>Mr Devine says staff need closed offices so they can concentrate on the safety aspects of their work.</p>

<p>The man in charge of the State's police gets his turn today at the Police Royal Commission.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Mr Lauer testified about what he indicated was official and community tolerance of vice and illegal gambling up until the early 1980s.</p>
<p>He also said he stood by his earlier evidence to the Commission, given almost two years ago.</p>
<p>Mr Lauer said then that institutionalised corruption had ended.</p>

<p>The Victorian left-hander clinched selection with a stylish 158 for an Australian 11 against the West Indians in the first innings of the four day match in Hobart.</p>
<p>The innings followed two impressive seasons in the Sheffield Shield, in which he's built a reputation as a heavy run scorer.</p>
