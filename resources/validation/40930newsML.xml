<p>Chechen rebel leaders who battled Russian troops for the capital Grozny in early 1995 are due to return to the city on Tuesday -- but this time to discuss the make-up of a new government in peace.</p>
<p>Separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov and other top rebels are to take part in a congress of political groups in Grozny, abandoned by both Russian troops and rebel fighters under a peace deal, Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>Maskhadov and Moscow envoy Alexander Lebed agreed terms in August to end 21 months of fighting, which killed tens of thousands of people, and defer by five years a decision on the most sensitive issue, the region's future political status.</p>
<p>Russia also agreed to withdraw most of the forces it sent in December 1994 to quell the separatist revolt in Chechnya. Russian troops have suffered a series of humiliating defeats and have failed to establish control over the whole of Chechnya.</p>
<p>The agreement, said by Lebed to have no winners or losers, has won conditional backing from President Boris Yeltsin, who is on holiday near Moscow before undergoing heart surgery.</p>
<p>But the deal has in effect dumped the pro-Moscow administration, led by Doku Zavgayev, and left most of the region in rebel hands with few concessions by the separatists.</p>
<p>Zavgayev was quoted by Itar-Tass news agency as saying his administration would not be taking part in Tuesday's congress.</p>
<p>Yandarbiyev has made clear he sees the five-year period agreed with Lebed as a chance for Russia to find a face-saving way to rubberstamp the region's independence rather than time for the rebels to reconsider their defiance of Moscow's rule.</p>
<p>Some top Russian officials, including Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov and influential Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, have distanced themselves from Lebed, expressing varying degrees of doubts about the terms.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin and Lebed met on Monday to discuss the legal status of the latest peace agreement and issues concerning the formation of a coalition government in Chechnya, the two officials' press offices said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>The Grozny congress of about 20 mainly pro-rebel groups is being held just days after celebrations of the fifth anniversary of Chechnya's declaration of independence.</p>
<p>Interfax did not say whether the Chechen separatist leaders planned to be in Grozny only for the congress or whether they meant to establish a permanent presence in the devastated city.</p>
<p>It quoted a press spokesman for the Security Council, of which Lebed is secretary, as saying he would not go to Grozny on Tuesday, but that he could visit Chechnya later this week. It had quoted organisers as saying he could address the congress.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted a senior rebel source as saying the congress would discuss how to create a new Chechen government which could be formed this autumn.</p>
<p>Lebed says Chechnya should have a coalition cabinet to avoid civil war between the rebels, who control the south of the region, and their pro-Moscow rivals, who are strong in the north and some parts of central Chechnya.</p>
<p>But the rebels have made clear they mean to form their own cabinet incorporating representatives of other political groups and including some members of Zavgayev government.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted Ruslan Kutayev, a leading participant of the Grozny conference, as saying the rebels had reserved up to 10 seats in the government for other parties.</p>
<p>Kutayev said &quot;professionals and experts&quot; from Zavgayev's government would be welcomed into the new cabinet. He said three of Zavgayev's aides had already been invited.</p>
<p>Zavgayev, who is currently in Moscow, has accused Lebed of staging a coup d'etat and surrendering Chechnya to the separatists. He says his cabinet is based in the town of Urus Martan in central Chechnya and has no plans to stop functioning.</p>
