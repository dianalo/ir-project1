<p>Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole hammered away at President Clinton on immigration and ethics on Saturday in California, hoping to cut his Democratic rival's commanding lead in a key state.</p>
<p>&quot;He thinks he has this state wrapped up. He thinks California's in the bag. But it's not going to happen,&quot; Dole promised during a &quot;Rally the Valley&quot; bus tour of the fertile Central Valley.</p>
<p>A fired-up Dole suggested Clinton go on television to apologise to the American people for scandals in his administration.</p>
<p>&quot;I say to the president of the United States, why don't you just get on television ... to confess to the American people that none of this should have happened? You ought to go ask for mercy,&quot; Dole said.</p>
<p>The Dole campaign has decided to focus much of its time and money on this prize state in the 10 days before the election. California has 54 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House.</p>
<p>A Los Angeles Times poll earlier this week showed Dole trailing Clinton by 20 points in California, but Republican campaign officials say their own polls show a single-digit gap.</p>
<p>Dole drew respectable, but not huge, crowds in a part of the state Republicans consider a stronghold. Asked why Dole was spending so much time in an area where he already had support, California strategist Ken Khachigian said, &quot;To run up the score, I need every vote I can get.&quot;</p>
<p>Khachigian said immigration would be a key focus for Dole. Half his television advertisements and all his radio ads in the state will accuse Clinton of not doing enough to crack down on illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&quot;Suddenly now in an election year, President Clinton is moving all these (immigration) agents from other states into California, trying to make it appear he's really going to get tough,&quot; Dole said in Selma. &quot;Why did you wait four years, Mr. President?&quot;</p>
<p>Throughout the day, Dole punched away at Clinton, making the case that his administration was too corrupt for him to be re-elected.</p>
<p>He reeled off a list of scandals, from possibly illegal donations to the Democrats to the Whitewater affair and the White House's improper acquisition of 900 FBI files on Republicans.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you imagine a Republican president doing any of those things? No,&quot; Dole said in Visalia.</p>
<p>Then, apparently remembering the scandal that brought down former Republican President Richard Nixon, he added: &quot;In fact, Watergate wasn't very pleasant for Republicans. I know somebody who went to jail for looking at one FBI file, one FBI file. Not 900.&quot;</p>
<p>Later Dole said Republicans had been punished for Watergate and probably should have been.</p>
<p>The Kansas Republican, badly wounded in the Second World War, criticised Clinton for not serving in Vietnam. &quot;I've never said a thing about the president's record in the service -- lack of record, let's put it that way. But I am just a little unnerved when I see him wearing those army fatigues like he's been in the army all his life,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Immigration has been a hot issue in California, where 59 percent of voters approved a proposition to deny nearly all benefits to illegal immigrants. Its implementation has been held up in the courts.</p>
<p>Clinton has made a concentrated effort to woo California since taking office, visiting the state about 30 times and dispensing government defence contracts and other aid.</p>
<p>Dole, who has lashed out at reporters in recent days, said on Saturday he was sorry if he had offended the press corps. He then repeated some of his charges against it.</p>
