<headline>EU's Brittan, Brazil to discuss cars, ag exports.</headline>
<text>
<p>RIO DE JANEIRO, April 3 - The automobile industry, soluble coffee, orange juice, poultry and meat are expected to be discussed during a visit to Brazil by EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, a Brazilian foreign ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand that Commissioner Brittan wants to talk about the automobile sector,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Brazil meanwhile wants to raise questions concerning agricultural exports to the EU, principally soluble coffee, orange juice, meat and poultry,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Brittan is Thursday beginning a two-day official trip to Brazil and is scheduled to meet with President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and several of his ministers.</p>
<p>Brazil has for some time been lobbying the EU to open up what it sees as trade barriers to its agricultural exports to the region.</p>
<p>In the case of soluble coffee, an import tax on Brazilian soluble coffee rose to 10.1 percent as of January 1, 1997 from a previous tariff of nine percent.  </p>
<p>Other Latin American nations such as Colombia, Central American countries and Ecuador have a zero tax while Mexico saw its tariff reduced to 5.2 percent from the beginning of this year against a previous tax of 8.6 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't know about this meeting but we have been pressing the Foreign Ministry to do something. We are very anxious for them to discuss it,&quot; said Mauro Malta, executive secretary of the Brazilian Soluble Coffee Industry Association (ABICS).  </p>
<p>Sales of Brazilian soluble coffee to the EU were just over 5,000 tonnes in 1996 out of total exports of around 58,000 tonnes. Sales to the region have been gradually falling throughout the 1990s because of the tariff, ABICS said.</p>
<p>In the case of orange juice, Brazil is looking to increase the size of its quota to the EU while Italy is believed to be lobbying for the Brazilian quota to be reduced, the foreign ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>In the 1995/96 crop year (July/June), Brazil exported 711,200 tonnes of a total of 1.03 million tonnes of frozen concentrated orange juice to the EU.</p>
<p>This was up from 643,600 tonnes the previous year, making up for a drop in sales to the U.S. Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>In the 1996/97 crop year, as of the end of February, some 555,000 out of a total 815,000 tonnes had been shipped to the region, according to the Brazilian Citrus Exporters Association.</p>
