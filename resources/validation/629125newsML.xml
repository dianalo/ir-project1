<p>Somali gunmen hijacked a World Food Programme (WFP) convoy carrying relief food supplies in north Mogadishu on Sunday, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They said the gunmen, in two &quot;technicals&quot; (armed vehicles), fired warning shots before driving off with two food-carrying trucks to the former Italian Embassy, now a militia base.</p>
<p>The trucks were heading for a military hospital in south Mogadishu when they were attacked.</p>
<p>On Saturday, ten people were killed and six wounded when unidentified gunmen ambushed a truck 60 km (40 miles) south of Mogadishu, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They said the truck, carrying goods and passengers heading for Baidoa town, overturned as the driver tried to escape from the ambush by driving off the road.</p>
<p>Among the dead were a mother and her three children aged between one and eight years.</p>
<p>The attacks came only two days after leaders of the two main Somali factions announced agreement to end hostilities and work for reconciliation in the war-torn country.</p>
<p>Ali Mohammed Mahdi and Hussein Farah Aideed, respectively leaders of the Somali Salvation Alliance and the United Somali Congress, announced their agreement after two days of talks in Cairo.</p>
<p>Somalia has been without an effective government since January 1991 when the government of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown.</p>
<p>The south of the country has since been controlled by a number of different armed factions, while the north has declared its secession and independence as the Republic of Somaliland, with its capital in Hargeisa.</p>
