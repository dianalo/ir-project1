<p>NatWest Markets chief executive Martin Owen said on Thursday he did not expect losses from the investment bank's interest rate options to be any larger than the 77 million pounds ($123 million) it announced earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;This should be the end of the matter from a financial perspective, it is obviously not the end of the matter from a personnel perspective,&quot; Owen told Reuters. He said the options loss seemed to have started as a trading position within approved limits.  </p>
<p>Earlier NatWest Markets' parent, Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc, announced wide-ranging actions to restore confidence including the suspension of four senior staff and the cutting of eight million pounds in bonuses.</p>
<p>It also said that Owen would forego 200,000 pounds of his 1996 performance bonus. NatWest's chief executive Derek Wanless told Reuters Owen's bonus had originally totalled 500,000 pounds and would be reduced to 300,000.</p>
<p>The actions were taken after NatWest revealed the options losses, which went back to 1994, nearly two weeks ago. Owen said the initial trading position appeared to have been within approved limits but that a &quot;whole process of systematic mispricing had occurred&quot; to cover an initial loss.</p>
<p>&quot;There were obviously failures of internal control that failed to discover it and monitor it,&quot; Owen said. He would not comment on whether this was the result of one individual's actions, adding such detail would be established in the second phase of an internal inquiry into the affair.
