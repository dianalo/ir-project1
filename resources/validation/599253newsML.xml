<headline>Sex is secret of long life, says Italian, aged 101.</headline>
<dateline>UDINE, Italy 1997-05-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>An Italian man of 101, who has been married for 77 years, on Tuesday revealed the secret of his long life -- lots of sex.</p>
<p>&quot;I still feel as if I were a little boy,&quot; Giulio Paggi told family and friends gathered to celebrate at the family's home in northeastern Italy.</p>
<p>&quot;And the secret of this youthfulness is that all my life I've put a lot into lovemaking,&quot; Paggi said with a smile.</p>
<p>Both Paggi and his wife, Alice Gandus, were born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1896. Paggi was a prisoner of war in World War One. He married Alice in 1920 and worked as a typewriter salesman until he was 90.</p>
