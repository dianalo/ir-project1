<p>Dozens of Kurds clutching suitcases began crossing the Turkish border on Sunday at the start of an evacuation by pro-U.S. Iraqis who fear Baghdad's increased influence in northern Iraq, witnesses said.</p>
<p>About fifty Kurds, from a group of several hundred brought to the border in a fleet of battered buses, walked across the Habur bridge crossing for passage to Turkey from where they were to be processed for asylum in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel great. I just want to get across that bridge,&quot; said a refugee who identified himself only as Moyyad. A Turkish tank waited on the other side of the border.</p>
<p>As many as 2,500 Iraqi Kurds were to be relocated to a camp in the Turkish town of Silopi. Most worked as employees of U.S. aid programmes and the U.S.-led air operation patrolling a no-fly zone for Iraqi aircraft in northern Iraq. But some are believed to have been engaged in intelligence activities for the Americans.</p>
<p>The Kurds had been holed up in small hotels and private residences waiting to escape since Iraqi troops helped the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) faction take the city of Arbil from a rival group late last month.</p>
<p>The KDP, led by Massoud Barzani, went on to conquer most of northern Iraq and boost Saddam's prestige in a region where he had been ineffective for the past five years.</p>
<p>The U.S.-led force has been patrolling northern Iraq since after the Gulf War in 1991. Baghdad announced on Friday it would suspend missile attacks on intruding planes after Washington began a military build up in response to a failed missile strike on U.S. planes over northern Iraq last week.</p>
<p>Among the Iraqis to be ferried out were adminstrators, drivers and messengers who had worked for Washington in the region. They were to take their families with them.</p>
<p>&quot;The last 10 days have been like 10 years,&quot; said Moyyad, who had been waiting in a house with 17 other people in Dohuk, about 50 km (30 miles) south of the border.</p>
<p>&quot;The chidren are naughty, my wife is sick and I have been smoking three packs of cigarettes a day and feeling chest pains. All of this is from the strain,&quot; Moyyad said.</p>
<p>About 250 members of the Iraqi National Congress, a U.S.-funded group dedicated to the overthrow of Saddam, were also set to cross the border in the next few days.</p>
<p>The Washington Post said on Sunday that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had spent about $100 million since 1991 to oust Saddam, with very little to show for its efforts.</p>
<p>The paper said the CIA had funded dissident Kurds and Iraqis, enabling them to buy light arms and ammunition, communications gear, publishing materials, broadcasting equipment, cars, trucks, food and medicine.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens in government programmes in Iraqi Kurdistan were evacuated shortly after a round of Kurdish infighting broke out in Arbil on August 31. Some private aid workers, however, chose to stay behind.</p>
<p>Officials of the Baghdad-backed KDP are reluctant to see so many of the region's skilled people leave and say the refugees' fears of a return by Saddam's forces are unfounded.</p>
