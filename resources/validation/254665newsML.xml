<p>Mexico's overnight Cetes rate shot up 200 basis points to 30.50 percent at the close on Friday on speculation and jitters over volatile U.S. financial markets, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Jitters were contagious from the open over the weak peso and the (early) hike in U.S. long-bond rates,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>&quot;Although pressure then eased off a little, speculation took its toll ahead of the FOMC meeting,&quot; said a trader, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Dec 17 to review U.S. interest rates.  </p>
<p>Yields on U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds rose in early trade to 6.65 percent, from 6.60 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Although yields receded in later trade on Friday, dealers noted they were still much higher than the low of 6.32 percent reached in recent sessions and had thus triggered fears of primary rate hikes.</p>
<p>&quot;Uncertainty has stifled trade in the term market. Nonetheless, the few deals settled were all above current primary rates,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Government 28-day paper changed hands at 28.50 percent, compared to 27.29 percent assigned at Monday's primary auction.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile closed up 155 basis points at 31.30 percent.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico offset liquidity shortages by injecting 3.639 billion pesos through two credit auctions, which it assigned at average rates of 31.01 and 31.05 percent.</p>
<p>Total credit maturities for Monday were estimated at 5.487 billion pesos.</p>
