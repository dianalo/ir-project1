<text>
<p>Mexico's overnight Cetes rate receded from an intraday high Thursday but still closed up 175 basis points at 31.25 percent in trading influenced by a volatile peso, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates soared at the open due to a run on the peso, but they began to recede when the peso staggered back to its feet,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>The overnight Cetes rate had opened at 32.25 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We were expecting a calmer session, as banks did not have to rush to grab liquidity to settle accounts with the central bank, like they did yesterday. But then the peso was in trouble and that jacked rates up again,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso closed 2.5 centavos firmer at 7.96/7.98 per dollar after weakening to 8.055/8.075.</p>
<p>Term rates also recovered in tandem with the peso. Rates on 91-day Cetes closed 110 basis points down at 29 percent, after reaching highs of 30.3 percent.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico injected a hefty 7.896 billion pesos during the session. Traders said the injection was intended to offset liquidity shortages arising from corporate tax payments of some 5.00 billion pesos.</p>
<p>&quot;Credit maturities were not too heavy but, as it seems some firms will not be working tomorrow, month-end demand for liquidity was substantial.&quot;</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper closed 135 basis points 32.75 percent.</p>
