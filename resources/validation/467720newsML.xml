<p>Shanghai Worldbest Co stocks are worth holding after the firm's 1996 net profit soared 135.69 percent, and it faces a promising year ahead, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Worldbest's 1996 results are satisfactory,&quot; said a local analyst. &quot;The company's production technology is advanced, which brings them high profit margins, so we recommend a holding of the company's stock.&quot;</p>
<p>Worldbest, a textile company, issued annual results on Monday showing net profit surged to 79.087 million yuan ($9.5 million) in 1996, up from 1995's 33.555 million yuan based on international accounting standards.</p>
<p>Based on domestic accounting standards, 1996 net was 80.24 million yuan. The company had targeted a net profit of around 80 million yuan for 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The result is ahead of our expectations,&quot; said an analyst with a foreign brokerage based in Shanghai. &quot;It is likely to show decent growth in 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>Worldbest said on Tuesday that good management, including proper acquisitions of other firms' shares, helped boost its post-tax 1996 profits by 135.69 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1996, the company tried its best to improve management, develop new products and activate sales, which guaranteed the fulfillment of its profit target,&quot; the company said in its 1996 annual report published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The company listed foreign currency B shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on July 26, 1996.</p>
<p>After the listing, the firm bought controlling stakes in Changzhou Huachang Dying Industrial Co, a Sino-South Korean joint venture, and Changzhou Worldbest Radici Engineering Plastic Co, a Sino-Italian joint venture, the report said.</p>
<p>These purchases had strengthened its capacity to produce chemical fibres, it said.</p>
<p>An analyst with the company's main underwriter, Haitong Securities Co, said the results were in line with expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;The company's results and dividends are both okay, and meet the market's expectation,&quot; the analyst said. &quot;The company has only been listed for five months so the dividend is reasonable.&quot;</p>
<p>The company's board of directors proposes a pre-tax cash dividend of 0.105 yuan per share for B share holders, the company annual report said.</p>
<p>Analysts said Worldbest was likely to continue its upward trend in 1997. Its joint ventures should soon start moving into profit and newly-imported assembly-lines and equipment will produce more polyester and boost profit margins, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The company's net profit is expected to rise to around 100 million yuan once its joint ventures and new assembly-lines become fully operational,&quot; said an analyst with one of the largest China brokerage houses.</p>
<p>&quot;Its main products -- differential polyester filaments -- will see profit margins of 25 to 30 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The company's annual report said assembly lines imported from Japan will boost annual polyester production capacity by 4,000 tonnes once they go into operation in April.</p>
<p>Changzhou Huachang Dying Industrial Co, 75-percent controlled by Worldbest, has annual silk dying capacity of 200 million metres (218 million yards), the annual report said.</p>
<p>Changzhou Worldbest Radici Engineering Plastic will boast annual production capacity of 60,000 tonnes of plastics by the end of 1997, it said.</p>
<p>Worldbest's B shares ended at $0.514 on Tuesday, up $0.006 or 1.18 percent from Monday's close, as the second heaviest trade of 1.29 million shares.</p>
