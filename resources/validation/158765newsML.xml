<p>Iran's main conservative clergy group nominated Speaker of Parliament Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri as their candidate in next year's presidential elections, newspapers reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>They said the Combatant Clergy Association (CCA), whose members include almost all of Iran's top officials, unanimously backed Nateq-Nouri's nomination for the polls that will choose a successor to President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani, who is barred by the constitution from running for a consecutive third term, as well as Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei are members of CCA's central council.</p>
<p>Nateq-Nouri has in the past year kept a high profile in the media prompting widespread expectations that he would run, but he has not officially announced his candidacy.</p>
<p>The nomination is the second he received from an influential group in Iran. Earlier this week, he received the support of a conservative group of Shi'ite Moslem theologians in the holy city of Qom.</p>
<p>With the backing of the conservative clerical establishment and so far with no strong challenger, Nateq-Nouri remains the most prominant nominee for the presidency, Iran's top executive position after a 1989 consitutional reform removed the post of prime minister.</p>
<p>The hopes of radical groups were dashed as their strong candidate against Nateq-Nouri, former prime minister Mir Hosein Musavi, said he was not running. The pro-Rafsanjani centrists have not yet nominated a candidate although they were reportedly coordinating with other factions.</p>
<p>Nateq-Nouri, a Shi'ite cleric, is the leader of the majority conservatives in parliament who uphold a stricter interpretation of religious and social norms of the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p>
