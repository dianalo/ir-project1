<p>India and China signed an agreement on Friday aimed at reducing tensions along their Himalayan frontier, over which they fought a war in 1962.</p>
<p>Both sides said the agreement on confidence-building measures in military areas along the line of actual control could lead to troop and weapon cutbacks.</p>
<p>&quot;What has been signed is a substantive, a very useful and a forward-looking agreement, which is a major step forward,&quot; Salman Haider, the most senior civil servant in India's Foreign Ministry, told a media briefing.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told reporters: &quot;The two sides today signed an agreement on confidence-building measures in the military field along the line of actual control in the border areas of India and China.</p>
<p>&quot;They hope this agreement will facilitate consultative agreements between both sides,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>It was signed by Indian Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen after talks between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>Jiang is on the second day of a three-day state visit, the first to India by a Chinese president.</p>
<p>Indian officials said other issues raised at the Jiang-Gowda talks included Afghanistan and Chinese arms sales to Pakistan, India's traditional foe.</p>
<p>The issue of the 4,500-km (2,800-mile) frontier is viewed as central to problems between the two countries, home to one-third of the world's population.</p>
<p>The pact reaffirmed that &quot;neither side shall use or threaten to use force against the other by any means or seek unilateral military superiority&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The two sides shall reduce or limit the number of field army, border defence forces, para-military forces and any other mutually agreed category of armed force deployed in mutually agreed geographical zones along the line of actual control to ceilings to be mutually agreed upon,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The agreement said major categories of weapons to be reduced or limited included tanks, infantry combat vehicles, guns, including howitzers, of 75 mm or more and surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles.</p>
<p>Shen, speaking through an interpreter, said: &quot;When such an agreement is implemented, the number of the armies along this area will be reduced.</p>
<p>&quot;When I refer to the reduction of military personnel, I mean the reduction will depend on the actual conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;If peace and tranquillity are maintained in this area, I don't believe there is any need to maintain a large number of military personnel there,&quot; Shen added.</p>
<p>India and China signed an agreement in 1993 to ease tension along their frontier during a visit by former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to Beijing.</p>
<p>In August 1995, India and China agreed to pull back their troops from four border posts in India's northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, parts of which are claimed by China.</p>
<p>Haider said full implementation of the 1993 and 1996 pacts &quot;will help in advancing the shared agenda of developing an institutionalised framework of cooperation and for moving towards troop reduction and limitation on the India-China border.</p>
<p>The agreement said both sides would avoid large-scale military exercises involving more than one division of approximately 15,000 troops near the line of actual control.</p>
<p>&quot;However, if such exercises are to be conducted, the strategic direction of the main force involved shall not be towards the other side,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The two sides also signed agreements on preventing illegal drug trafficking, direct shipping links and an Indian consular office in Hong Kong after mid-1997 when China resumes sovereignty of the territory.</p>
<p>Jiang goes to Agra on Saturday to visit the Taj Mahal and heads for Pakistan on Sunday.</p>
