<p>President Boris Yeltsin, his condition stable five days after entering hospital with pneumonia, suggested on Monday that Russia and Belarus should consider holding referendums on a merger.</p>
<p>The Kremlin said Yeltsin was working on documents despite his latest illness, two months after heart surgery, and had sent a letter to Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko raising the possibility of a merger &quot;in one form or another&quot;.</p>
<p>The Kremlin announcement amounted to a diplomatic offensive against NATO's plans to accept members from eastern Europe. The announcement also appeared intended as a signal to political rivals demanding Yeltsin's resignation that the president is still able to work.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a strategic idea ... that the question be raised of holding a referendum on unification in one form or another,&quot; presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin called for moves to speed up integration between the two Slav states, which signed an agreement last April to tighten economic and political ties and to form a loose community.</p>
<p>His letter outlined plans eventually to have a single government, united fuel and energy systems and one budget.</p>
<p>Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, whose country has 10 million people compared to Russia's nearly 150 million and is much poorer, welcomed Yeltsin's initiative.</p>
<p>The proposal is unlikely to please NATO, which is expected to offer membership later this year to Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Moscow says such moves threaten its security and is considering its response.</p>
<p>One Kremlin official told the Russian news agency Interfax that unification with Belarus could be the best reaction. It would meet Russia's strategic and economic interests and boost its international authority, he said.</p>
<p>If Poland joined NATO and Russia and Belarus merged it would have borders with NATO.</p>
<p>Foreign policy, overshadowed by domestic politics for the last 12 months in what was a presidential election year, is a priority for Yeltsin this year, but his pneumonia has prevented him making the vigorous return to the Kremlin he was hoping for.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky said the 65-year-old president's condition was stable in Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital, where his wife Naina has also been taken with an infection.</p>
<p>&quot;In the doctors' opinion, the president is in a stable condition. His temperature and other indicators are in the normal range,&quot; Yastrzhembsky told a Kremlin briefing after doctors examined Yeltsin on Monday morning.</p>
<p>He did not say how long Yeltsin was able to work on papers or when he would be released. The spokesman repeated doctors' assessment that he needs about three weeks to recover fully.</p>
<p>Opposition communist leader Gennady Zyuganov added his voice to political foes suggesting Yeltsin is unfit to rule Russia. &quot;I think his close relatives, friends and close circle will say: &quot;Boris Nikolayevich, it is time to have a rest',&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has a series of meetings with foreign leaders scheduled in the next few months, including a summit with President Bill Clinton in the United States in March. Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin's travel plans had not been changed.</p>
