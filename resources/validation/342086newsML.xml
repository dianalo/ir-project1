<p>French flat-screen technology company Pixtech will become the sixth stock to be listed on new growth stocks market Easdaq when it begins trading on the pan-European exchange on February 7.</p>
<p>Subscriptions to the firm's public offer of up to 4.5 million shares, which began on January 23, close on February 3 when the stock's price will be fixed.</p>
<p>&quot;The price fixing will be in a range of approximately $4 to $5, with reference to the stock's closing price on Nasdaq,&quot; Michel Birnbaum of Paris-based investment company Hambrecht &amp; Quist Saint Dominique told a news conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The company wants to widen the spectrum of investors, and Easdaq was the best way to do it,&quot; he added. Hambrecht &amp; Quist Saint Dominique belongs to the syndicate placing the stock.</p>
<p>Pixtech delayed its initial planned launch on the fledgling European exchange from late last year due to poor stock market conditions on Wall Street and elsewhere, Birnbaum said.</p>
<p>On the U.S. Nasdaq market its shares closed at $6 on Tuesday, continuing a choppy recovery from $3-3/8 in mid-November. Introduced to Nasdaq in 1995 at $9.5, the stock peaked at $14 in February 1996.</p>
<p>Pixtech's executive vice president Francis Courreges said funds raised would mainly be used to finance a high-volume manufacturing process.</p>
<p>The firm designs, develops and manufactures field emission displays (FED) - a flat screen panel display which it says compares favourably to the liquid crystal display (LCD) alternative currently used widely, for example in portable computers.</p>
<p>The FED, it says, produces a better quality and brighter picture than LCD, uses less power and works in more extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>The FED panel works by placing a phosphor screen in front of a plate of millions of micron sized &quot;microtips&quot; which are attached to a cathode conductor sheet. Sandwiched between two glass plates, the panel is just 2.5 millimetres thick.</p>
<p>A coloured image is created by electrons striking the phosphor in the same way as with a television or computer monitor screen which uses a conventional cathode ray tube.</p>
<p>&quot;Pixtech is at the stage where we are now turning to high-volume production,&quot; Courreges added, saying the company had a short term annual revenue goal of over $100 million.</p>
<p>Pixtech had total revenues of $11.5 million in 1995, when it made a net loss of $6.3 million.</p>
