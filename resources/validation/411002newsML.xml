<p>India's largest oil refiner Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has told the government it will not be able to pay for imports after April because of a financial crunch, the Economic Times newspaper said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The IOC has indicated to the government it will be unable to pay for oil imports after April if nothing is done to improve its financial position,&quot; the paper said, quoting an unnamed &quot;senior&quot; IOC official.</p>
<p>IOC has a monopoly over the bulk of India's oil imports.</p>
<p>The paper said IOC has a foreign exchange ceiling of $2.9 billion, which will be exhausted by the end of April 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The ceiling will be reached by the end of April,&quot; it quoted the official as saying. &quot;There is no point in contracting for the oil and then not being able to pay for it. It is better not to import at all,&quot; the official was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>It said the finance ministry recently raised IOC's forex exposure to $2.9 billion from $2.5 billion. IOC had asked for a forex exposure ceiling of $3.5 billion, the paper said.</p>
<p>&quot;Latest reports indicate that it will be allowed to raise an additional $0.6 billion in the form of foreign currency loans from Indian banks,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>IOC officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
