<p>JCI Ltd's proposed Beira iron ore project could become the third most competitive iron plant in the world because of access to cheap gas and might import iron ore from Brazil if Zimbabwe did not have enough, a JCI official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Project leader Hugh Brown told an African mining conference that access to gas costing about 40 US cents a gigajoule would &quot;give us a much higher flexibility for the purchasing or sourcing of iron&quot;.</p>
<p>JCI announced in November that it would participate in a feasibility study into the proposed three billion rand iron ore benefication project that would use resources from Zimbabwe and Mozambique.</p>
<p>Brown said that the project could use gas from the either the Temane gas field off the Mozambican coast, the Sofala field or the Buzi field.</p>
<p>The project involved importing iron ore from Zimbabwe, where JCI was presently investigating a number of potential reserves.</p>
<p>This would be moved by dedicated rail to the reduction plant at the head of the railway line between Machipanda and Beira. The finished product would be transported to the sea for export to the Pacific Rim and Middle East.</p>
<p>&quot;If a smaller reserve than anticipated is found in Zimbabwe, we will take half a million tonnes a year out of there and take 2.5 million tonnes out of Brazil,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Brazil had the highest quality iron ore in the world and this would affect the quality of the iron produced.</p>
<p>Brown said JCI had concessions to sites in Zimbabwe with potential reserves of about 17 million tonnes</p>
<p>&quot;We are entering the second stage of the feasibility study and the initial geological phase in Zimbabwe ends on April 29,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;At that time we will bank the base case in terms of our iron ore options and decide exactly which gas field will provide the gas. From then on it is straight engineering and implementation.</p>
<p>&quot;The final decision to implement the project will be taken at the end of January 1998.&quot;</p>
<p>The project will produce 96 percent metallised iron in the form of briquettes which would help satisfy the shortage of iron in the steel business, partly related to scrap.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be particularly geared towards electric arc furnaces in the Middle East and Pacific Rim countries&quot;, Brown said.</p>
<p>If the project went ahead, it was likely to be the third merchant iron plant in the world, and the first involving a South African company.</p>
