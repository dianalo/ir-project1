<p>Vladimir Vujtek hit a hat-trick as world ice hockey champions the Czech Republic kept alive their hopes of a second title with a fight-filled 5-3 win over Canada on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Vujtek, who scored the only goal of the second period to put the Czechs 3-2 ahead, completed his triple strike when he back-handed the puck over Canada netminder Sean Burke to open the scoring in the third period.</p>
<p>The Czech's Rostislav Vlach and Canada's Don Sweeney traded goals before the game degenerated into a bench-clearing brawl.</p>
<p>Pressure and tempers had been building the entire period until they finally boiled over with about 40 seconds to play.</p>
<p>Several skirmishes broke out all over the ice, even netminders Burke and Roman Cechmanek were drawn into the fray, skating the length of the ice to confront each other.</p>
<p>Referee Peter Andersson of Sweden ultimately handed out a total of 244 minutes in penalties, including eight game misconducts, four to each team.</p>
<p>The bitter feeling spilled over into the post-game news conference, with Czech coach Slavomir Lerner accusing Canada's Andy Murray of being a cheat and the worst coach the country has had in seven years.</p>
<p>&quot;If he says I'm the weakest coach my question to him is if he is such a strong coach why is Ivan Hlinka behind the bench as a coach,&quot; said Murray in response to the accusations.</p>
<p>&quot;He called us Canadian cheaters, that I had no class, and now I know why the NHL players in Calgary where he was an assistant have no respect for him.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing we have to recognize is that the Czechs are the dirtiest players in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who has watched them play can see their stick work. A Canadian is a tough hockey player, a Czech is a dirty hockey player.&quot;</p>
<p>The final period ruined what until then had been an entertaining, wide open contest.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay Ligthnings Rob Zamunner had scored twice for Canada in the opening period while Vujtek notched his first and set up Martin Prochazka for another.</p>
<p>The win leaves Sweden, Canada and the Czech Republic all level on four points behind Russia, who lead the standings with five. The U.S. have three followed by Finland with two.</p>
