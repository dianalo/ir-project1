<p>Taiwan's baking industry is pressing the government to lower its wheat subsidy fund benchmark price to ensure wheat imports are subsidised at a time of falling world wheat prices.</p>
<p>The Cake and Biscuit Makers Association asked the Council of Agriculture to lower the level at which wheat purchases can be subsidised to US$195 per tonne from US$245.</p>
<p>Association officials said this would help to reduce local flour prices by ensuring importers can continue to tap the subsidy fund, set up in 1972 to stabilise local prices.</p>
<p>Falling world wheat prices have put Taiwan import costs at about US$200 per tonne, too low for importers to tap the fund.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat prices have dropped to around US$4 per bushel from 1996 highs of over US$7 per bushel.</p>
<p>The council rejected an immediate adjustment but has agreed to review the issue in coming weeks, council official Lee Yuan-ho told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;The council will not adjust subsidy levels now but we will monitor the outcome of Friday's wheat tender result,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Flour Mills Association will tender on Friday for 60,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat, traders have said.</p>
<p>The fund subsidises importers' costs above the council-fixed benchmark level.</p>
<p>Taiwan is phasing out the subsidy in its bid to enter the World Trade Organisation, saying it would not replenish the fund once the remaining T$400 million (US$14.5 million) is paid out.</p>
<p>Once the fund is exhausted, Taiwan consumers can expect to face fluctuating flour prices dictated mainly by world grain prices which can spike as high as US$305 per tonne, Lee said.</p>
<p>Lee said the trend away from subsidies could not be stopped despite the bakers' dire warnings.</p>
<p>&quot;We must liberalise our market if Taiwan wants to remain competitive in the international market,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade Organisation has been stalled by lingering monopolisation and state control of some sectors as well as by rival China's insistence on entering the WTO first.</p>
<p>The United States, Europe, Canada and Japan have blocked Beijing's WTO entry, citing structural barriers that keep foreign firms out of many of China's markets.</p>
