<p>Albanian rebels holding this southern port town on Friday rejected a government offer of amnesty if they surrendered their weapons.</p>
<p>Fuat Karali, a former police officer and now a member of the town's rebel council, said the rebels would hold Sarande until President Sali Berisha resigned and general elections were held.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not giving up our weapons until Berisha resigns. Down with the dictatorship,&quot; Fuat Karali told a cheering mass rally in the main square.</p>
<p>Berisha, facing a popular uprising in Albania's south, set a 48-hour period from Friday when the rebels could surrender their arms in return for amnesty.</p>
<p>But there appeared to be no takers in Sarande, where defence barricades were being strengthened and hundreds of rebels were organising the town to withstand a long siege.</p>
<p>Karali, speaking on behalf of the new rebel council, ordered parents to confiscate weapons from children 18 or under because of accidents in recent days.</p>
<p>Anti-government riots swept Sarande last weekend and weapons were looted from state armouries. Thousands of locals, including pre-teenage children, have wandered through Sarande firing a variety of weapons.</p>
<p>Albania has been rocked by anti-government protests and riots since January when five get-rich-quick pyramid investment schemes failed, wiping out the savings of thousands of families.</p>
<p>Rebels have seized towns in the relatively prosperous southern region of Europe's poorest state, including Vlore, Tepelene and Sarande.</p>
<p>Captured army tanks guard the eastern entrance to Sarande and heavily-armed rebels have dug in with anti-aircraft guns. Rebel guards have been posted at government buildings and the hospital.</p>
<p>Residents said petrol was running low and hospital director Petraq Kaci said he needed plasma and a portable x-ray machine to help locate bullets in the wounded.</p>
<p>Rebels clashed with regular army troops about 20 kms (12 miles) east of Sarande on Wednesday. Four rebels and at least two soldiers were wounded.</p>
<p>The hospital was also treating two suspected secret police agents who had been savagely beaten by a crowd.</p>
