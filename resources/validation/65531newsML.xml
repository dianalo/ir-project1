<p>Ex-UK air cargo rate rises not seen this year, earmarked for</p>
<p>April</p>
<p>By Helen Hill</p>
<p>LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuter) - The usual round of October general rates increases look unlikely as carriers remain reticent to push the rates up. Next April looks to be the preferred month for any inceases, a Reuter survey showed.</p>
<p>An All Nippon Airlines spokesman said the rates would remain stable, adding the market is 'not quite ready'. April next year may be the time ANA looks for an increase, he added.</p>
<p>Korean Airlines cargo manager, Frank Smith, said he is extremely cautious about any autumn increases, adding that April looks more likely.</p>
<p>A spokesman from leading freight forwarder, MSAS, Doug Overett, was more adamant about the prospect of rates rises. &quot;Many think the market could not take any rates rises, it is not a strong enough market to squeeze any more from&quot;, he added.</p>
<p>Ray Disson, UK cargo manager of Emirates Airline, said the carrier will probably not increase rates to Dubai in October because Emirates had increased rates on the route for the last three years.</p>
<p>Some carriers have bucked the trend, American Airlines has put increases in place and German carrier Lufthansa is considering some increases.</p>
<p>John Smith, UK cargo manager of American Airlines, added that a five percent increase had been added to all routes. Demand is very strong, he said, &quot;we would not put prices up unless we were confident&quot;.</p>
<p>Lufthansa's UK marketing manager, Ruediger Helm, said Lufthansa has increased its &quot;Flash' express tariffs by six to seven percent on August 1.</p>
<p>But as regards general cargo he added, &quot;we are evaluating rates increases but a dramatic increase would not be right'. After the first quarter of the year activity levelled off a little, he said.</p>
<p>Most carriers claim to be looking for stability in the market. United Airlines UK cargo manager, Peter Chase, said United is another carrier preferring to take a more cautious approach to rates rises.</p>
<p>However, he commented, United reviews rates twice a year and would prefer to see stability in the market.</p>
<p>&quot;We would prefer to create a stable base from which people can operate and we would actually prefer to look at the rates once a year and retain them on an annual basis.&quot;</p>
<p>Concerning market activity, most report that September has seen a pick-up as the summer season draws to a close and people return to work.</p>
<p>But in all markets, the condition cannot be described as booming, though most say it is in line with their expectations.</p>
<p>Barry Gibson of Singapore Airlines (SIA) said so far business to Asia is positive, following the usual August slown-down because of the holidays and factory closures.</p>
<p>SIA had quite severe payload restrictions because of high passenger loads and weather conditions in the summer, he said. Already the airline is able to carry around five tons per flight more than it could in the summer, he said.</p>
<p>SIA is another carrier that will not be introducing increases, it too is looking to next April for rises,he said.</p>
<p>Business to north east Asia seems to have shown the biggest pick-up in business. An ANA spokesman said the Japanese carrier already had all of its space booked on Monday for the following weekend and the outlook was good for the coming weeks. From the UK he was confident the carrier would be above budget, he added.</p>
<p>He put the upturn in business volumes down to the UK's favourable exchange rate. But he admitted business inbound from Japan was not quite so buoyant.</p>
<p>Korean Airlines in the UK was even more optimistic.Frank Smith, UK cargo manager said September was in line with expectations and the airline was ahead of this time last year. He added that he was way above budget.</p>
<p>He added that despite the busy market he too remains very cautious about any rates rises because the European Continent is not as buoyant as the UK market.</p>
<p>Rates have remained exceptionally stable to the Asian market, showing little signs of changing. Rates to Korea and Australia have edged up slightly to 1.83 stg and 2.05 stg a kg respectively.</p>
<p>Most air cargo players operating in the UK-U.S. market have looked forward to the return of winter schedules as summer charters travelling to popular holiday destinations have created a glut of capacity on certain routes.</p>
<p>Kevin Durnin of Viking Freight, representative of Leisure International Airways, said outbound business is difficult especially because of the competition generated because of holiday traffic.</p>
<p>Rates have been dumped, market sources said, especially to destinations such as Orlando and Atlanta during the summer. One shipper requested a 0.35 a kg rate on a 6.5 ton shipment to Atlanta, said one source.</p>
<p>However, John Smith, cargo manager of American Airlines, said he felt confident enough in the market and for that reason the carrier had implemented rates rises.</p>
<p>Demand has remained strong to the U.S., he said, though competition on price and quality has remained tough.</p>
<p>United Airlines Peter Chase said there are signs of an upward trend this month, although it has not been as rapid as the carrier would have liked, he admitted.</p>
<p>He said that business was not quite as good as last year although he admitted, 1995 was an exceptional year for many. Last year, manufacturers went through a re-stocking programme, he said. Chase added that he expects the fourth quarter to be reasonable but not the boom it was in 1995.</p>
<p>U.S. rates are fairly stable even though a lot of spot-rate activity has being taking place. Rates to Los Angeles have fallen to 0.69 from 0.71 per kg and New York has gone up slightly from 0.60 to 0.61 per kg.</p>
<p>In the Middle East market ex-UK, carriers say September has seen a &quot;small pick-up'. A Gulf Air spokesman said activity has increased slightly and that he is expecting a stable fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Disson of Emirates said this year is as good as last year. However, there is more spot-rate activity in the market this month, with even the larger carriers getting involved in some very competitive pricing, he said.</p>
<p>Africa is again generating a lot of interest in the market in the UK as German carrier Lufthansa introduces a weekly DC8 freighter from London Gatwick to Nairobi and Virgin Atlantic prepares to launch its South African service.</p>
<p>Lufthansa's Helm said Africa is an interesting market and not only for the perishables industry. Semi-finished and finished goods are increasing traffic to Africa, he added.</p>
<p>People are buying more in Africa and there is much more confidence in southern Africa, especially, which has led more companies to set up production plants in the country, he said.</p>
<p>Latin America demand remains strong, with airline's travelling at full capacity. Paul Ryan, of Varig Brazilian Airways, said Sao Paulo and Rio are full. Shipments for the many automobile manufacturers based in Brazil are generating a lot of business, he said.</p>
<p>Rates to Sao Paulo remain strong and are showing an upward swing to 2.06 stg a kg. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 8982 Fax +44 171 542 5017</p>
