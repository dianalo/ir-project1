<p>Afghanistan's rebel Taleban Islamic militia said on Friday it had captured a strategic eastern district, dealing a new blow to President Burhanuddin Rabbani's beleaguered government in Kabul.</p>
<p>A Taleban spokesman in Pakistan, quoted by a private Afghan news service, said Logar province's Azra district, southeast of Kabul, had fallen early on Friday after overnight fighting.</p>
<p>Taleban forces now control all of Azra district including its central town of the same name, the Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) quoted spokesman Maulvi Ahmad Jan as saying in the northwestern Pakistani town of Peshawar.</p>
<p>There was no independent confirmation of the report.</p>
<p>AIP said the government had sent reinforcements, including tanks, to the area on Thursday night and on Friday from Kabul and the eastern town of Sarobi in an apparent move to block the Taleban advance.</p>
<p>A neutral administration in adjoining Nangarhar province also has sent forces to strengthen its positions on the provincial border to check any Taleban encroachment, it said.</p>
<p>An Afghan government spokesman said in Kabul on Thursday that the Taleban had launched a major assault on Azra in an apparent move to reach Sarobi, about 60 km (37 miles) east of Kabul, and control the main eastern highway to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Both sides used artillery and tanks in the battle, AIP said.</p>
<p>It quoted Jan as saying at least 20 government fighters were killed, including a commander, and 10 were captured. He did not give the Taleban casualty figure. Jan had earlier put the government death toll at nine.</p>
<p>The reported fall of Azra follows a government assault on Taleban positions southwest of Kabul on Monday, which had closed for a day the capital's main supply route from the southwest.</p>
<p>Sarobi has long been a stronghold of Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami party. But Taleban advances against Hezb in neighbouring Paktia province last month prompted fears that it might be the next target of the powerful militia, which controls about half of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Afghan government spokesman Amrullah said on Thursday that the Taleban seemed to be trying to intensify fighting around Kabul to gain ground before international efforts to bring peace to the war-shattered country could make much progress.</p>
<p>The Taleban, entrenched in the hills south of Kabul for the past year, have sworn to oust Rabbani and impose strict Islamic rule throughout Afghanistan.</p>
