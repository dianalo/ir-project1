<title>USA: Molten Metal process to get Hanford test.</title>

<p>Molten Metal Technology Inc said its recycling technology has been selected by the U.S. Department of Energy as one of two processes to be tested for the clean up of the tank waste site in Hanford, Wash.</p>
<p>M4 Environmental, Molten Metal's partnership with Lockheed Martin Corp, estimated the value of the contract's total value at $4 billion.</p>
<p>British Nuclear Fuels, which was awarded the second DOE contract for Phase I of the Tank Waste Remediation System Program, valued the effort at $2 to $4 billion, while Molten Metal put the value at $3 billion.  </p>
<p>All said the only firm part of either contract is Phase 1A. It covers the first 20 months of the program and includes a $27 million award to each team to prove the efficacy of their processes by developing detailed plans, filing for permits, and demonstrating operating ability.</p>
<p>Phase 1B covers processing of less than 10 percent of the waste at Hanford over a five-to-seven year period and should be worth about $3 billion, Molten Metal said.</p>
<p>M4 said the second phase, worth about $3.5 billion over 10 to 14 years, involves construction and operation of a pilot plant for processing about 10 percent of Hanford's tank waste.  </p>
<p>M4 is part of a team headed by Lockheed. The other members are French owned Numatec, two Fluor Corp units, Duke Power Co, Halliburton Co's Babcock and Wilcox, German-owned  Nukem Nuclear Technologies,  Los Alamos Technical Associates, British owned  AEA Technology and OHM Corp's OMH Remediation Services affiliate.</p>
<p>Molten Metal's Catalytic Extraction Processing -- or CEP -- system uses molten metal to reduce hazardous waste compounds to their basic elements.  With the addition of select reactants, these elements can be recombined to form desired industrial products.  </p>
<p>The Quantum-CEP technology to be tested at Hanford is a related technology for processing radioactive waste.  It destroys the hazardous components and reduces and stabilizes the radionuclides.</p>
<p>Hanford is one of several storage sites for radioactive nuclear waste produced during the arms race between the United States and the former Soviet Union. Highly radioactive waste has been stored in large underground tanks since 1944.</p>
<p>Molten Metal said about 56 million gallons of waste are stored in 177 tanks. These caustic wastes are in the form of liquids, slurries, saltcakes, and sludges.</p>
<p>The Tank Waste Remediation System Program was established in 1991 to manage treatment and disposal of these wastes in a safe, cost-effective, and environmentally sound manner.</p>
<p>Molten Metal noted complete cleanup of the Hanford Tanks could require 30 years and cost as much as $30 billion.</p>
<p>In addition to Hanford, similar wastes are stored at four other sites in the U.S. -- the Savannah River site in South Carolina; the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory; a site in West Valley, N.Y,; and a site in Oak Ridge, Tenn. Many other similar sites exist around the world.</p>
