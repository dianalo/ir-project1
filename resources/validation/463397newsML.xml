<p>SIMEX Euroyen and Japanese government bond (JGB) futures rebounded from a sharp early sell-off on Monday as players covered their positions following a late plunge in Tokyo stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;It was just some short-covering. The market had been oversold earlier,&quot; said a senior trader at an Asian institution.</p>
<p>He said players were likely to remain cautious ahead of Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which is widely expected to result in a 25 basis point hike in U.S. rates.  </p>
<p>December Euroyen was quoted at 98.93 at 1115 GMT after falling as low as 98.82 against its IMM close at 98.94. Turnover was an active 32,300 lots.</p>
<p>June JGBs settled at 125.09 against their previous 125.49 after hitting a low of 124.62.</p>
<p>Dealers said the Bank of Japan (BOJ)'s neutral money market operation triggered heavy sales of Euroyen and JGB futures on fears of an impending change in Japan's monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The BOJ was expected to inject 200 billion yen in the money market but the actual injection was only 100 billion,&quot; said a dealer with a U.S. house.  </p>
<p>He said the lower than expected injection had kept the overnight call loan rate well above the central bank's official discount rate of 0.50 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The BOJ may be trying to flatten out the yield curve a bit, hinting at their future policy. Instead of coming out and hiking rates in one sharp move, this would bring the short end of the curve up gradually,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't expect the BOJ to tighten rates now even if the tankan comes out very well,&quot; the first trader said, referring to the BOJ's quarterly business sentiment survey due on April 2.  </p>
<p>Eurodollar futures were glued within a one-tick band with most players choosing to stay flat ahead of the Fed meeting.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was unlikely to react to a 25 basis point hike, but it could move sharply if the Fed left rates unchanged or raised them by 50 basis points.</p>
<p>September Eurodollars ended at 93.815 against their IMM close at 93.810 on light volume of 5,910 lots.</p>
