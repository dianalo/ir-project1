<p>Ghana warned Sierra Leone coup leaders on Saturday that time was running out for a negotiated settlement and dispatched troops to join a Nigerian-led force already in the country.</p>
<p>Acting Foreign Minister Kwamena Ahwoi urged coup leaders to respond to diplomatic efforts and warned that if they didn't, West African leaders might have to use force.</p>
<p>&quot;It could be 24 hours, it could be a week,&quot; he told BBC radio. Regional power Nigeria said it was consulting other West African states.</p>
<p>Military sources said Ghana was sending troops on Saturday via Monrovia, the capital of neighbouring Liberia. They will secure the international airport at Lungi, north of the capital, and the smaller one at Hastings to the south, near the Nigerian military base, freeing up the Nigerians.</p>
<p>Coup leaders, who toppled a civilian government elected in March 1996 after four years of military rule, said negotiations were under way to avert any attack. The Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) said there was no cause for alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;The AFRC wishes the public to know that while it is aware of a possible threat to the public security, negotiations are continuing,&quot; said a statement on national radio. &quot;The public, therefore, has no reason to be unduly alarmed.&quot;</p>
<p>About 2,000 foreigners have been flown out of Freetown, and others fled homes for two beachside hotels protected by Nigerian troops. A group of West Africans who arrived at the Mammy Yoko Hotel on Friday night camped on the tennis court.</p>
<p>France told its remaining nationals to assemble at the Cape Sierra Hotel but there was no immediate word on whether a boat or plane was on its way.</p>
<p>&quot;My head of state has been holding intensive sub-regional consultations at all levels and is taking appropriate action to ensure that quick restoration of peace, stability and legitimate government must take place in Sierra Leone,&quot; Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi told Nigerian state radio.</p>
<p>Nigeria has been flying in jeeps, armoured personnel carriers and troops to join its forces already based in Sierra Leone under a regional peacekeeping arrangement.</p>
<p>Tensions rose sharply in Freetown after leading politician John Karefa-Smart said on BBC Africa Service radio that Nigerian troops would attack on Saturday following this week's evacuation of Americans and other Westerners from the capital.</p>
<p>But Washington, which is suspending the operation of its embassy in Freetown, said it opposed any use of force to bring back the civilian government.</p>
<p>Nigeria leads the West African ECOMOG regional peacekeeping force which was sent to Liberia in 1990. Some ECOMOG troops, including Nigerians, have been based in Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>Diplomats said the coup leaders' announcement on Thursday that they were closing Sierra Leone's borders and banning all flights was mainly aimed at stopping the Nigerian buildup.</p>
<p>Military and diplomatic sources said leaders of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), who had been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1991 but are now allied to the coup soldiers, entered the capital this week.</p>
<p>Underlining the confusion, state radio has carried bellicose statements by RUF rebels who have apparently hijacked the takeover and are rejecting any mediation.</p>
<p>&quot;We are advising the Nigerians and all foreign forces to stop bringing war materials to threaten the peace for our people,&quot; said a statement by RUF official James Coleman.</p>
