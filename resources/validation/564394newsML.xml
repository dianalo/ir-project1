<headline>Rushdie says EU rowback on Iran &quot;contemptible&quot;.</headline>

<p>Author Salman Rushdie on Tuesday condemned as &quot;contemptible&quot; a decision by the European Union to allow its ambassadors to return to Tehran despite evidence of Iran's involvement in terrorism.</p>
<p>The Indian-born British author has been campaigning for eight years for international action against Iran since religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a death sentence against him for alleged blasphemy in his novel &quot;The Satanic Verses.&quot;</p>
<p>EU ambassadors were withdrawn in April after a German court ruled that Iran's rulers had ordered political assassinations in Europe. But last week, less than three weeks later, the EU decided to allow the envoys to return to Tehran.</p>
<p>&quot;Frankly I think it is pathetic. I was very surprised that after the...trial actually convicted the Iranian leadership of terrorism in a German court that...after token gestures nothing was done,&quot; Rushdie told CNN television in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;It is pretty contemptible that Europe was unable to respond to the proof that terrorism had taken place on European soil. If people are trying to construct an idea of Europe which we all want to belong to, they can't do so if they don't take into account these human rights aspects,&quot; Rushdie added.</p>
<p>Rushdie had previously welcomed a German court finding that Iranian political leaders had ordered the killings of a group of Iranian Kurdish leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992.</p>
<p>He had said it could be an important first step in the eventual lifting of the death threat against him.</p>
<p>Rushdie said he hoped that Britain's new Labour government would take a more active part in getting the edict, or fatwa against him lifted.</p>
<p>He said Prime Minister Tony Blair had been &quot;emphatically supportive&quot; during meetings in the months before last week's landslide Labour election victory.</p>
<p>&quot;I would hope that it means that the new government will take a much more active line in this matter, both domestically -- because it is perfectly possible to make the daily circumstances of my life a little easier -- and internationally in trying to lead a campaign to get this threat lifted,&quot; Rushdie said.</p>
<p>Rushdie said he was pleased that &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; was still available in bookshops in most parts of the world, and said he lived &quot;as real a life as possible&quot; despite round the clock police protection.</p>
<p>&quot;The big problem is spontaneity. The problem is the inability to do things on the spur of the moment just because you feel like it now. That is very frustrating,&quot; he said.</p>
