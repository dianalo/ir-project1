<title>HUNGARY: Rallying MOL steals show on Budapest mkt.</title>
<headline>Rallying MOL steals show on Budapest mkt.</headline>

<p>Surging stocks in oil and gas firm MOL overshadowed the Hungarian market on Friday but its gains just about offset losses elsewhere on the market, traders said.</p>
<p>The BUX index of the Budapest Stock Exchange, which celebrates its seventh birthday on Saturday, finished at a preliminary 6,460.13 points, up 9.45.</p>
<p>Trading in MOL started with a rally to a new record level of 4,185 forints on expectations of the size of the gas price increase but some intraday profit-taking trimmed earlier gains. MOL finished at 4,090 forints, up 160.</p>
<p>&quot;Expectations of the gas price increase boosted MOL's price further but the stock could not hold 4,100 forints as many began to lock in profits,&quot; said Peter Nagy of Postabank Securities.</p>
<p>Chemicals and pharmaceuticals stocks were also hit by profit-taking but Nagy said these papers had strong support levels. &quot;One can see the support levels of certain stocks at current lower levels,&quot; Nagy said.</p>
<p>He said chemicals TVK had a support at between 3,000 to 3,050 forints, MOL at 4,000 forints, pharmaceuticals Richter at 15,600 and Egis at 11,500 and OTP Bank at 4,500.</p>
<p>The size of the quarterly energy price increase is a sensitive component of MOL's earnings and, since it is the market's largest capitalised paper, was likely to lead the rest of the bourse.</p>
<p>Hungary's Industry and Trade Ministry said earlier on Friday it would decide on the price increase on Monday.</p>
<p>The apparent upper end of the market's expectations is 17 percent while the lower end seems to be at 10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;There is potential that it could only be at 10 percent level,&quot; said Tommy Erdei, analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett in Budapest. &quot;If it does come out at 10 percent, I would think that MOL would certainly not go upwards,&quot; he said. &quot;If it comes out at 17 percent then MOL is going to continue to go up.&quot;</p>
<p>Erdei added that apart from the energy price increase there might be some volatility in the downward direction, which is a usual phenomenon before the earnings season as people get a little worried about companies' performance.</p>
<p>Hungarian companies have to submit their first half earnings reports to the bourse by August 15.</p>
<p>On Friday, tile maker Zalakeramia had a strong demand at between 7,200 and 7,280 forints, Nagy said. The paper closed at 7,280, down 170.</p>
<p>TVK closed at 3,100, down 65; Richter at 15,650 forints, down 55; Egis at 11,580, down 120 and OTP at 4,525, down 20.</p>
