<p>Sour feelings over Washington state's poor showing in the latest Conservation Reserve Program signup could cost one federal official his job and lead to a broader intepretation of the program's air quality criteria.</p>
<p>To the surprise of local officials, the U.S. Agriculture Department accepted only 172,013 acres, or about 20 percent, of Washington land offered for the CRP this spring.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, nearly 80 percent of the land offered in neighboring Oregon and Idaho was accepted.</p>
<p>&quot;We were extremely disappointed,&quot; said Ross Lahren, a natural scientist team leader in the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service state office in Spokane.</p>
<p>They weren't the only ones.</p>
<p>Rep. George Nethercutt, a Washington Republican, last week tried to have Washington NRSC State Conservationist Lynn Brown fired because of the state's poor showing.</p>
<p>Nethercutt later withdrew his proposal at the request of Rep. Joe Skeen, a New Mexico Republican who chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee on agriculture.</p>
<p>But Nethercutt reserved his right to pursue the matter when the full committee meets next week to work on the fiscal 1998 farm spending bill or when it reaches the House floor.</p>
<p>Nethercutt also urged USDA to reopen the spring enrollment to give Washington farmers another chance. That request was denied, but USDA did promise that any land now in the CRP under contracts expiring September 30 could immediately reenter the program if accepted in a second signup in November or December</p>
<p>In retrospect, the state NRSC office could have boosted Washington's CRP enrollment chances by doing some things differently, Lahren said.</p>
<p>For example, if more farmers had been willing to plant an improved cover crop on their CRP land, Washington enrollment might have been 100,000 acres higher, he said.</p>
<p>But Lahren noted that Washington drew its state &quot;conservation priority area&quot; to encompass as much acreage now in the CRP as it could. It did that because USDA's revised soil &quot;erodibility&quot; criteria excludes many Washington acres. So, land now in the program had to requalify by other means, he said.</p>
<p>But in the end, USDA accepted few of the 500,000 acres offered in Washington's priority zone because the land did not score high enough on USDA's air quality scale.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the baby that really killed us,&quot; Lahren said.</p>
<p>USDA awards points for air quality based partly on how close land is to major cities. That hurt farmers in eastern Washington, where the most land was offered.</p>
<p>As in other states, Washington also had to rely on wind erosion surveys done years ago. Those do not reflect volcanic ash in the soil as a result of the Mount St. Helen's eruption in 1980, Lahren said.</p>
<p>Had the ash been factored into wind erosion ratings, more land in the Washington conservation priority area would have scored higher on the air quality scale, he said.</p>
<p>But redoing the soil erodibility surveys is a &quot;double-edged sword&quot; that could require many more Washington farmers to implement costly &quot;conservation compliance&quot; plans on acreage enrolled in the USDA crop subsidy program, he said.</p>
<p>Parks Shackleford, assistant deputy administrator of USDA's Farm Service Agency, agreed that changing the soil erosion surveys could hurt as many Washington farmers as it helps.</p>
<p>But the department will look at giving more weight to volcanic soils in its air quality ratings. &quot;I think there is a legitimate concern&quot; in that area, he said.</p>
<p>While some things &quot;could have been done better&quot; by the Washington NRSC office, &quot;I don't think it's at all fair to say it was totally blown out there,&quot; Shackleford said.</p>
