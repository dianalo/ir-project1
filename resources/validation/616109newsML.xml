<headline>Badminton-Hoyer-Larsen set to end lean spell.</headline>
<text>
<p>GLASGOW, May 26 (Reuter) Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen, last year's All-England, European and Olympic champion, is bidding to complete the set of major badminton titles as the world championships start in Glasgow on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But the man who dominated in 1996 has struggled to hit form this year. The Dane has not won a tournament since his Olympic triumph in Atlanta, and has also been struggling with a toe injury that may require an operation.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old scored a morale-boosting win over reigning world champion, Heryanto Arbi from Indonesia, in the Sudirman Cup team championship last week, and is in a determined mood.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been difficult to get motivated since the Olympics,&quot; said Hoyer-Larsen. &quot;Last year, I was so focused on winning the three major titles. Once I had achieved it, it was easy to become too relaxed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I now feel I am back mentally. I'm looking forward to the championships, and I definitely feel ready to win.&quot;</p>
<p>Hoyer-Larsen is seeded second here to Dong Jiong, the man who beat him at the semifinal stage of the All-England championships in March.</p>
<p>He is due to meet number five seed, Joko Suprianto from Indonesia, in the quarter-finals and number three seed, Sun Jun, in the semis.</p>
