<headline>Mason-Dixon files suit vs investor group.</headline>
<dateline>BALTIMORE 1996-12-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mason-Dixon Bancshares Inc said on Monday it filed suit in U.S. district court against a group of 17 investors led by a former employee.</p>
<p>The suit sought declaratory and injunctive relief under U.S. federal securities laws and under Maryland banking laws, the company said. The group, which had a 5.1 percent ownership stake in Mason-Dixon, said on November 22 the company should explore oppportunities for a merger or consolidation.</p>
<p>In a 13D filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said the company's earnings were below the industry average.  </p>
<p>The investors, led by Barbara Floyd, president of Anthony Investments and a former Mason-Dixon employee, filed a 13D last month with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to report the group had beneficial ownership of 5.1 percent of Mason's voting stock, the company said.</p>
<p>Mason-Dixon said Alvie Spencer Jr., a former company director who was removed from his post last year, was also part of the group.</p>
<p>Mason-Dixon said the company has consistently outperformed its national peer group in 1992, 1993 and 1994 and earnings have only been affected recently as a result of a July  1995 acquisition of the Bank of Maryland.</p>
<p>It also said the 13D contained an agreement between Anthony Investments and the group, for Floyd's company to receive a fee upon sale of Mason-Dixon, or if the company's share price rose above $17.50 per share.</p>
<p>Mason-Dixon is the parent company of Carroll County Bank and Trust and Bank of Maryland.</p>
