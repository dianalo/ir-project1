<headline>Mississippi, tobacco settle first Medicaid suit.</headline>

<p>By Gail Appleson, Law Correspondent</p>
<p>Mississippi's top legal officer reached a last-minute settlement of the state's Medicaid suit against the tobacco industry, halting the first trial of 40 such cases across the country, his office said Thursday.</p>
<p>Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore concluded frantic negotiations that began in Washington last week and was headed back to Jackson, Miss., to announce terms of the settlement at an afternoon news conference.</p>
<p>Trey Bobinger, a top aide to Moore, said that an agreement had been reached but he could not confirm the terms. Some news reports said Thursday that the settlement was for $3 billion.</p>
<p>Bobinger said Mississippi's pact with the tobacco industry was consistent with the broader settlement reached last month.</p>
<p>He said, however, that if the larger pact does not survive, &quot;This protects our position, it protects the people of Mississippi.&quot;</p>
<p>Mississippi was the first state to sue the industry in May 1994, seeking to recoup $940 million in Medicaid costs of treating sick smokers.</p>
<p>Moore had given the industry a Thursday afternoon deadline to reach a settlement or proceed with what would have been a historic trial.</p>
<p>Although the nation's top legal officers and the tobacco industry reached a landmark $368.5 billion pact last month that included some health care concessions from cigarette makers, the accord has been criticized as too lenient by a number of members of Congress, which must approve it.</p>
<p>In addition, President Clinton said the tobacco settlement must not be allowed to paralyze the federal Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>With the agreement's fate uncertain, the states must settle their lawsuits individually or go to trial.</p>
<p>Bobinger said that Moore believed that the national settlement would pass Congress in a form similar to the one agreed upon by state attorneys general and the industry last month.</p>
<p>The Mississippi case was widely watched because it would have been the first of the lawsuits to go to trial and because it was considered a particularly strong case.</p>
<p>The case was to be decided by a judge, not a jury, and Mississippi law is favorable to the plaintiffs, legal experts say.</p>
<p>However, going to trial would have been very risky to both the states and the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>If Mississippi won, it would have signaled the strength of these innovative lawsuits and help support demands for a greater amount of money and for health care concessions from the industry.</p>
<p>If the cigarette makers had won, however, it would have boosted the industry's resolve to fight the other lawsuits and to resist efforts to obtain a harsher overall settlement through legislation.</p>
<p>Most tobacco stocks rallied on the news of the Mississippi settlement.</p>
