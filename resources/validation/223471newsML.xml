<p>European Union ministers began debating on Thursday how to end a stalemate over how quickly to open up the EU's postal services market to competition.</p>
<p>The EU's Irish presidency, seeking to bridge the gap between a Franco-German camp hoping to delay liberalisation and another wanting to move more quickly, proposed a compromise on the key question of when to open up direct mail and cross-border mail.</p>
<p>The proposal, presented at a meeting of post and telecommunications ministers, would see state post offices lose their monopolies over those two sectors by January 2001 -- but only for mail weighing more than 200 grams.</p>
<p>EU governments and the European Parliament would decide by the end of 2000 whether to keep that deadline and the European Commission would later make proposals for further liberalisation.</p>
<p>The European Commission, which argues that state post offices must become more competitive in an era of electronic mail and faxes, had originally proposed that direct mail (&quot;junk mail&quot;) and incoming cross-border mail be opened up by 2001.</p>
<p>By contrast, the Franco-German text set no target dates for liberalising the two sectors, saying only that the issue should be considered in 2001 and no action actually taken before July 2003.</p>
<p>France, mindful of the strikes that paralysed the country a year ago and wary of triggering more social unrest, has led the effort to water down plans to force post offices to face competition to deliver some mail.</p>
<p>Germany surprised its EU partners by agreeing to support France, despite plans to liberalise its own postal sector. Post Minister Wolfgang Boetsch told reporters on Thursday that he was supporting France out of a sense of solidarity.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps you can call that a bit sentimental,&quot; he said. &quot;But for me it's a piece in the mosaic of the Franco-German relationship.&quot;</p>
<p>The Franco-German initiative won support from seven other ministers during initial discussions, EU officials said. Those wanting to move slowly argue that huge numbers of jobs are at stake and that abrupt liberalisation would lead to a deterioration of &quot;universal service&quot; -- basic mail delivery to all citizens.</p>
<p>But a bloc of countries -- Britain, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden -- and the Commission were fighting for a more ambitious timetable, officials said.</p>
<p>Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann told the ministers the Commission wanted to see a compromise with a &quot;clear orientation&quot; toward liberalisation, one official said.</p>
<p>If the Commission refuses to support a text agreed by ministers, they can only adopt it unanimously -- a feat that would be impossible to achieve on this issue.</p>
<p>France and Germany agreed to drop language that seemed to leave the Commission out of future decisions on postal liberalisation, officials said. The Commission had complained that the language violated EU law.</p>
