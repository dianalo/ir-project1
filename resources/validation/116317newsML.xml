<p>HSBC's Hongkong Bank has launched a savings concept in soccer-mad Mauritius that links savings returns with the performance of English club giants Liverpool and Manchester United in the premier league.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a great deal for savers because they will not only earn the normal savings rate of 8.0 percent but also benefit as that rate rises throughout the season, in line with the success of their chosen team,&quot; personal banking manager Matthew Smith said in a statement sent to Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Under the scheme, customers can open a Football Plus Liverpool Account or a Football Plus Manchester United Account with a minimum deposit of 5,000 rupees ($240).</p>
<p>Interest rate from each type of Football Plus account increases by 0.01 percent for each point earned by the corresponding football club in the English premier league.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently, Liverpool have 20 league points, followed closely by Manchester United with 16 points. This translates into a present interest rate of 8.20 percent for a Football Plus Liverpool account and a rate of 8.16 percent for a Manchester Account,&quot; Smith said in reference to when the scheme came into effect on Friday.</p>
<p>Interest rate reached by each type of account at the end of the 1996/97 season next May will be kept throughout the inter-season before being reset to the normal savings rate when the next English soccer campaign starts in August, officials of the bank said.</p>
<p>The Football Plus savings scheme was launched to coincide with the Manchester United-Liverpool clash on Saturday, which Manchester United won 1-0. It is an initiative of the Hongkong Bank office in Mauritius but will be extended to other parts of the world if proved successful here, officials said.</p>
<p>English soccer is one of the strongest elements in the British colonial heritage left to the 1.1 million inhabitants of this Indian Ocean island.</p>
<p>Mauritians are usually either passionate supporters of Liverpool or Manchester United and most often ignore other soccer clubs.</p>
