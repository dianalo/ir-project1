<p>Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, making a sudden climbdown in the face of marathon pro-democracy demonstrations, said on Tuesday that opposition victories in disputed regional elections must be reinstated.</p>
<p>The austere authoritarian Milosevic, who had virtually ignored street unrest buffeting the country and unleashed his dreaded security police on demonstrators two days ago, asked for parliamentary action to restore the election outcome.</p>
<p>Opposition coalition leaders cautiously welcomed the news but vowed to continue peaceful street protests -- now in their 77th (corrects from 78th) consecutive day -- until the media were liberalised and other democratic reforms undertaken.</p>
<p>Socialist Party (SPS) hardliners close to Milosevic had annulled balloting in 14 major cities and towns in November, citing unspecified &quot;irregularities&quot; which the opposition party bloc denounced as fraud.</p>
<p>The Socialists reran the elections but the opposition party bloc boycotted them and pressure intensified in the streets at home and diplomatic corridors abroad for the SPS to concede defeat and avert civil conflict.</p>
<p>After two days of security police assaults on opposition demonstrators that raised fears of emergency rule, Milosevic turned around and instructed his prime minister to have parliament uphold the election outcome.</p>
<p>Neo-communist hardliners in the ruling party coalition could try to obstruct a parliamentary resolution but Milosevic's strongman will was likely to prevail.</p>
<p>&quot;In keeping with its constitutional competence, I propose that the Serbian government submit to parliament a draft emergency law which will proclaim as final results of a part of local elections in Serbia in keeping with the findings of the OSCE (factfinding) mission,&quot; Milosevic wrote to Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic, as quoted by the official news agency Tanjug.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish to stress that the interest of the state to promote relations with the OSCE and the international community surpasses by far the importance of any number of council seats in several towns,&quot; Milosevic's letter said.</p>
<p>The letter made no mention of a timetable for such parliamentary action but political analysts say it would probably start soon.</p>
<p>Investigators from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe who came to Serbia in December verified the opposition's claim to election triumphs.</p>
<p>Western governments turned up the heat on Milosevic by warning him that federal Yugoslavia, which groups Serbia and tiny Montenegro, could forget about reconstruction aid for its sanctions-wrecked economy unless it began democratic reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that the election disputes... especially in Belgrade...have inflicted great damage to our country at the internal and international level and that this is the final moment for the problem to be resolved in the highest institutions of our republic, the government and the national assembly,&quot; Milosevic added in his letter.</p>
<p>Eighty-thousand opposition demonstrators massed in central Belgrade on Tuesday and cheered heartily when told of Milosevic's strategic retreat.</p>
<p>But opposition co-leader Zoran Djindjic, wary of possible Socialist subterfuges, said demonstrations would not end yet.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue them until all (municipal) councillor mandates are verified, until freedom of the media is established, and until responsibility is established of all those who took part in the vote theft and brutal beating up of citizens,&quot; he told the raucous, whistling throng.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course this means nothing. Do they (Socialists) think that after 77 days and all the people who were wounded (by police attacks) they can end everything with one letter?&quot; said one sceptical man in the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;There were hundreds of other legal solutions that could have been made until now. The courts should have respected the law all along,&quot; said another opposition leader, Vesna Pesic.</p>
<p>&quot;If someone now finds it easier to convene the parliament and adopt some sort of special law, then let them do so. Let them find whatever route they want, we shall accept any they want, just so long as our election victory is restored.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier in the day the 54-nation OSCE, from which the Yugoslav federation comprising Serbia and Montenegro has been suspended, appealed urgently for dialogue between Milosevic and the opposition party bloc known as Zajedno (Together).</p>
<p>Municipal institutions have limited powers in Serbia but still important for their control over regional media, especially television, which have been used by leftist authorities for decades to discredit dissent.</p>
<p>Parliamentary and presidential elections are due in Serbia by the end of 1997 and a liberalised media climate could boost the opposition cause at a time of widespread discontent over economic decline and isolation from the West.</p>
<p>Orthodox Church clerics and army officers back the protesters. Universities, schools and lawyers are on strike. Movie distributors shut down Belgrade's popular annual film festival on Monday in outrage over police violence.</p>
