<p>Conservative President Jacques Chirac named Socialist leader Lionel Jospin as prime minister on Monday after an upset election win heralded French policies less focused on austerity to qualify for a single European currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The president offered to appoint me as prime minister. I accepted,&quot; Jospin said after meeting Chirac in the Elysee Palace, inaugurating the third period of power-sharing between a rival government and president in France in the past 11 years.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Jospin, defeated by Chirac in a runoff for the presidency in 1995, told reporters that he aimed to form a government &quot;quickly, this week.&quot; He is to take over formally from defeated premier Alain Juppe on Tuesday at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT).</p>
<p>French financial markets partly recouped early losses after opening down on news of Sunday's left-wing victory in the National Assembly election, in which the Socialists will need support from the Communist Party to secure a majority.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 stock market index was down 0.75 percent in early afternoon after opening 2.7 percent lower. The franc and bonds were also under pressure.</p>
<p>Humiliated by the defeat, conservative Juppe earlier tendered his resignation to his long-time mentor Chirac after both men's gamble that France would re-elect the ruling centre-right went disastrously awry.</p>
<p>Jospin, 59, short-circuited the official protocol by announcing his own appointment instead of leaving it up to the presidency. He said the talks had taken place in an &quot;excellent&quot; atmosphere.</p>
<p>Final results showed the Socialists and their left-wing allies had won 273 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly and the Communists 38 after Sunday's decisive runoff. The ecologists won seven, their first seats in parliament.</p>
<p>The outgoing centre-right coalition, which had held 464 seats in the outgoing Assembly, crashed to 257. The far-right National Front and an independent in the French Caribbean island of Martinique won one seat each.</p>
<p>Chirac spoke by telephone with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, his main ally in Europe, as EU governments wondered what the French shift would mean for economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;It's too early to say,&quot; British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said as he arrived at an EU ministerial meeting in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>In two previous bouts of &quot;cohabitation&quot; from 1986 to 1988 and from 1993 to 1995, the late Socialist president Francois Mitterrand claimed pre-eminence in foreign affairs and left day-to-day domestic policy to centre-right governments.</p>
<p>Monday's change of government stemmed from Chirac's fateful decision on April 21 to call a snap election 10 months early, hoping to win a friendly majority for the rest of his seven-year term until 2002. He said France needed a &quot;new elan&quot; to prepare for a single European currency from 1999.</p>
<p>His pleas fell flat in a country more worried by his broken promises on job creation and lower taxes.</p>
<p>Jospin said after his victory on Sunday that the people had voted for a change of direction in European policy, but at the same time he reaffirmed that the Socialists broadly favoured launching the planned single European currency in 1999.</p>
<p>Party spokesman Francois Hollande reaffirmed the Socialists' pledge that they would not impose further austerity to qualify for the euro and reiterated conditions for joining.</p>
<p>&quot;We all stand to gain if...Europe no longer means austerity,&quot; he said in a radio interview.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed the Socialist conditions -- entry of Italy and Spain from the start, creation of a political counterweight to offset the power of a European central bank, creation of an EU pact of solidarity and growth to boost jobs, and the principle that the euro should not be overvalued.</p>
<p>The Communists repeated their demands made to their Socialist allies during the recent campaign, including relaxing budget criteria for the single European currency. Party leaders met to discuss whether to take part in government and scheduled a news conference at 2.30 p.m. (1230 GMT).</p>
<p>The Socialists have pledged to create 700,000 jobs for young people, half of them in the public sector, over the next three years, and to reduce the working week from 39 hours to 35 over five years without loss of pay.</p>
<p>But the Communists want much faster action on both pledges, as well as wage hikes for the low paid.</p>
<p>Figures published on Monday showed that unemployment fell in April for the third month in a row, dipping 6,400 or 0.2 percent to 3,081,100. But the jobless rate was unchanged at a record 12.8 percent.</p>
