<p>The New England Patriots, moving quickly in an effort to put the Bill Parcells saga behind them, named San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Pete Carroll as their new head coach on Monday.</p>
<p>Carroll replaces Parcells, who stepped down Friday after leading the Patriots to their first Super Bowl appearance in 11 years, a 35-21 loss to the Green Bay Packers.</p>
<p>Carroll agreed to a five-year contract at undisclosed terms.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm excited about the opportunity and all the things that come along with taking the head coaching position,&quot; Carroll told reporters.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old Carroll has spent the last two seasons as defensive coordinator of the 49ers and gets his second chance to be an NFL head coach. He was coach of the New York Jets in 1994 and was fired after posting a 6-10 record.</p>
<p>Carroll was passed over for the top job in San Francisco, where Steve Mariucci was hired away from the University of California to replace George Seifert.</p>
<p>Parcells, who had feuded with owner Bob Kraft over control of player personel decisions, informed the Patriots last week that he would not extend his contract to coach in 1997.</p>
<p>NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue ruled earlier last week that Parcells was contractually bound to the Patriots for the 1997 season and cannot coach another NFL team in 1997 without Kraft's consent.</p>
<p>The Jets have contacted the Patriots about their interest in Parcells, but talks have stalled over Kraft's demand that compensation include the top pick in the upcoming NFL draft of college players, which the Jets' own thanks to a league-worst 1-15 record.</p>
<p>Various reports claim the Jets plan to interview Bill Belichick, who had served as assistant head coach to Parcells last season, in the event that negotiations for Parcells fall through.</p>
<p>Prior to being named the Jets' head coach, Carroll served as the team's defensive coordinator from 1990 to 1993. His 13-year NFL coaching career includes five seasons as defensive backs coach of the Minnesota Vikings.</p>
<p>Carroll coached 10 years on the collegiate level at Pacific, Arkansas, Iowa, Ohio State and North Carolina State.</p>
