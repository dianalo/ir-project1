<p>U.S. stocks are expected to open steady on Thursday, continuing their recent quiet tone.</p>
<p>Markets will absorb a bevy of economic data this morning, with jobless claims, new homes sales and Gross Domestic Product all due by mid-morning. But even these figures are not expected to stir markets out of the August doldrums.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless the numbers are way off course, they probably won't move the market,&quot; said Hildegard Zagorski, market analyst at Prudential Securities. &quot;It looks like two more slow days are in order for the rest of this week.&quot;  </p>
<p>At 0830 EDT/1230 GMT the U.S. Labor Department is to report weekly jobless claims. Economists expect 330,000 new claims, up from 327,000 in the previous week.</p>
<p>Revised second quarter GDP data are also due at 0830 EDT. Economists expect no change in the annual growth rate of 4.2 percent reported previously.</p>
<p>New home sales for July are due at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT. Economists are looking for 728,000 versus June's 734,000.</p>
<p>Also at 1000 EDT, the Conference Board reports the July U.S. help wanted advertising index. The index rose to 85.0 in June from 80.0 in May.  </p>
<p>With some much more closely watched economic data due next week, analysts doubted today's reports would carry enough weight for investors to abandon their wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got NAPM (National Association of Purchasing Management) and monthly employment coming next week,&quot; said Zagorski, &quot;Those are the significant ones.&quot;</p>
<p>In Tokyo, stocks continued their slide after a surprisingly weak Bank of Japan tankan survey reignited concerns about economic growth. The Nikkei-225 fell 157 points to 20,553.  </p>
<p>In London, U.S. stocks were lightly traded and little changed ahead of the heavy slate of economic data. The FTSE-100 fell 6.5 points to 3912.2.</p>
<p>The dollar was little changed in late Tokyo trade and held to the middle of tight ranges in Europe.</p>
<p>Intermediate- and long-term Treasuries were firm, with the benchmark 30-year bond up 6/32 to yield 6.97 percent.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index future eased 0.45 to 665.25.  </p>
<p>The New York Times's Marketplace column reports that stock mutual funds are again seeing net cash inflows.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column examines how Hilton Hotels Corp, in acquiring Bally Entertainment Corp, may win a key piece of property formerly owned by Bally affiliate Bally's Grand Inc.</p>
<p>Bally Entertainment bought the property from 85 percent-owned Bally's Grand for a price some Bally's Grand minority shareholders feel was too low, the column says.</p>
