<title>CHINA: China offers to send back Taiwan hijacker in May.</title>

<p>China on Wednesday offered to repatriate in mid-May a Taiwanese who hijacked a Taiwan airliner from the island to the communist mainland in March.</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross in the southeastern province of Fujian informed its Taiwan counterpart that Liu Shan-chung would be sent back to Taiwan by sea on May 14, state radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Taiwan authorities concerned are requested to rapidly reply to the arrangement before May 7,&quot; the radio said.</p>
<p>Beijing and Taipei have been rivals since the Communists won the Chinese civil war and drove the defeated Nationalists into exile on Taiwan in 1949.</p>
<p>Liu commandeered a Taiwan commercial jet to Xiamen on March 10, becoming the first hijacker to force a passenger plane from the island to the mainland in the 1990s rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>Shortly after Liu forced the jet to Xiamen, Taiwan called on Beijing to return him and offered in exchange to repatriate two mainland hijackers who had completed their prison terms.</p>
<p>The Straits Exchange Foundation, Taiwan's quasi-official agency in charge of dialogue with China in the absence of formal ties, said earlier this month its Beijing counterpart had offered to return Liu through the Red Cross.</p>
<p>Taipei is holding 16 mainlanders who hijacked a dozen planes to Taiwan in the 1990s and were convicted of air piracy.</p>
<p>Lee Ching-ping, deputy secretary-general of the foundation, is visiting China and has agreed with China's Ministry of Justice to step up cooperation on fighting crime and the repatriation of fugitives.</p>
