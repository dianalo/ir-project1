<p>French Employment Minister Martine Aubry said on Tuesday she would not be rushed into &quot;statistical tricks&quot; or creating &quot;hole-filler&quot; jobs to reduce the country's record jobless rate.</p>
<p>Aubry, second-in-command to Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, said her new left-wing government's promises to create 350,000 public-sector jobs, mainly for young people, would require meticulous planning and innovative solutions.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want to offer half-baked jobs. We have five years to do something more lasting,&quot; she told a first news conference since taking up a post which was beefed up and promoted in standing when Jospin's government took power a month ago.</p>
<p>Aubry presented a team of advisors comprising several local politicians and experts drawn from various ministries to signal that her ministry was as skilled in macroeconomics as in social affairs and that, above all, it would work closely with local and regional organisations in a more &quot;grassroots&quot; style.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll try to be as flexible as possible...as decentralised as possible,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Throughout the presentation and questioning by reporters, Aubry strove to paint an image as a long-term planner, keen to innovate on jobs through joint public-private sector projects and pragmatic on containing the social security deficit.</p>
<p>Aubry spelled out her priorities in the months ahead, saying she wanted a national conference on jobs, wages and working time reduction to generate genuine talks between employers and trade unions.</p>
<p>The conference, due to start in September, would be prepared with the drawing up of a report on France's economic performance in the past 10 years to provide solid support for the talks.</p>
<p>The Socialist-led coalition, which has declared employment its absolute priority, has promised to push for a reduction in the work week to 35 hours from 39 hours currently and to push for creation of 700,000 jobs, half of them in the public sector.</p>
<p>Framework legislation on shorter work time, including &quot;deadlines which will be neither too close nor too far off,&quot; would be drafted for presentation after the summer recess.</p>
<p>Aubry said a leap in unemployment in May -- a jump of 32,400 to 3,113,500 announced on Monday -- was enormous, but she would not resort to &quot;artificial methods&quot; to ease monthly statistics.</p>
<p>She said a 10-billion-franc deficit this year in the family benefits system justified proposed reforms. Jospin has proposed limiting child allowances to households with monthly income of less than 25,000 francs.</p>
<p>Aubry said there was no intention to apply the same reforms to the other branches of the strained social security system -- sickness and retirement insurance -- but that the government would continue the drive to control health spending.</p>
<p>Some doctors' unions, principally those representing private specialists, have fought hard to thwart spending caps imposed by the previous centre-right government. Aubry said she and health minister Bernard Kouchner would meet doctors' unions.</p>
<p>Another major reform Aubry will be involved in with finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn is lightening payroll taxes and transferring the burden to an existing welfare tax which is more widely based. She gave nothing away on the plans being prepared.</p>
<p>Aubry also said reducing tax relief for people who employ household staff such as live-in babysitters was an idea on the agenda but not one of the government's urgent priorities.</p>
