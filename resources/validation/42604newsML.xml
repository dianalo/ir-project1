<p>Ivory Coast is hoping to make its main city Abidjan into the Rotterdam or the Singapore of West Africa by promoting its location and expanding its port and oil-processing facilities.</p>
<p>But it could face stiff competition in the longer term if regional oil giant Nigeria solves organisational problems and brings more refining capacity on stream, industry sources say.</p>
<p>&quot;Nigerian refineries are much more complex, their economics would be better and the fact is they've got all the oil right there,&quot; one industry source told Reuters. Nigeria is currently running at 35 percent of its 20 million tonnes-a-year of refining capacity.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast's Mines and Energy Minister Lamine Fadika told a news conference recently that Abidjan's location was ideal for serving all countries in the sub-region.</p>
<p>&quot;We are at the centre of the Gulf of Guinea. From Mauritania to Angola, Abidjan is exactly in the middle,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our refinery in Abidjan is equipped with a hydrocracker which makes it the most efficient on the continent, perhaps with the exception of South Africa,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;With all this we have powerful weapons for making Abidjan the Rotterdam or the Singapore of West Africa,&quot; he said, referring to the maritime hubs which play major roles in the supply of oil and oil products to Europe and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Fadika said Abidjan had the best-run port in West Africa, after restructuring in the 1980s with help from France's Le Havre port authority.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to build the second pillar of the national economy on the (oil) sector so we need to have an investigative audit, a diagnostic audit of the structure of the sector,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Last month the government announced a purge of senior officials at state oil firm Petroci after uncovering serious problems in its administration and financial management.</p>
<p>Abidjan's refinery, Societe Ivoirienne de Raffinage (SIR), was also on the audit hit-list, Fadika said.</p>
<p>&quot;Its treatment capacity is 3.5 million tonnes and we want to raise that to 10 million tonnes. Can the structure handle it? Are the people in charge capable? This is the purpose of the audit,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Some industry sources were sceptical of the expansion plan.</p>
<p>&quot;It's one thing to say 'We have a complex refinery, we have a hydrocracker' but it's another thing to say the refinery is running well, that they're able to make the products,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's great to say 'Let's get it to 10 million' but where are they going to get the money and where are they going to sell the products? The regional market is not even near 10 million.&quot;</p>
<p>Jean Pierre Janin, SIR's French managing director, has a more modest target for expansion. He told Reuters last June that the company aimed to add one million tonnes to its capacity by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>He said SIR was also proposing to install a terminal at sea for tankers of 50,000-80,000 tonnes capacity that would be able to export finished products and receive crude, mostly Nigerian Forcados, for refining.</p>
<p>Janin also said SIR's main markets in West and Central Africa could be at risk if Nigeria made its refineries work better, although oil experts did not see that happening soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Their economics would beat SIR hands down if they got their act together, which they're not at the moment and I don't know anyone who thinks that they will any time soon,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if it (Nigeria) doesn't wake up we must be able to move out into remunerative markets. That's our strategy,&quot; Janin said, adding that SIR was hoping to sell unleaded gasoline to the United States and sulphur-free gas-oil to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Industry sources said the United Sates was a particularly hard market to satisfy and some doubted the refinery's ability to supply products of suitable quality. They said SIR would be best to concentrate on its regional market.</p>
<p>&quot;They can't even make products on specification right now. The United States is a hard market and, not only that, you've got the South Americans in doing it. Look at the economics of it, the geography of it,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>&quot;The refinery is best suited for mixed cargoes in the West African market. A lot of countries in the region depend on it quite heavily -- Guinea, Senegal to some extent, Liberia, Togo all the way down to Zaire,&quot; he said.</p>
