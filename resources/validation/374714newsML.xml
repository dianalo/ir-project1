<p>England's cricketers are well positioned to win their test series against New Zealand and reverse the bad publicity that has dogged them through much of the tour when the third and final test starts on Friday.</p>
<p>The winter trek began disastrously in Zimbabwe with a lost one-day series and a drawn test series but finally came right in Wellington on Monday with an emphatic innings victory in the second test.</p>
<p>England received flak from the press for allowing New Zealand to escape with a draw in the first test in Auckland after the last wicket pair batted for over three hours to save the game.</p>
<p>But England dominated that match as much as they did in Wellington and given New Zealand's frail batting performances and lack of penetration in the bowling, there is no reason to suggest the home side can win in Christchurch to square the series.</p>
<p>England captain Mike Atherton said that even in Zimbabwe, England were dominant in the test matches and he expects their strong form in the long version of the game to continue.</p>
<p>&quot;To win a three-match series generally you've got to win two games so we're going to Christchurch to win that one,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The current series is Atherton's 10th in charge and he has so far achieved only two rubber wins -- against New Zealand in 1994 and against India last year.</p>
<p>Atherton's overall test record as England captain is eight wins, 13 defeats and 17 draws.</p>
<p>For New Zealand, things can only improve. It is now ranked bottom of the table of test playing nations and defeat by an innings at home against England rankled with the public.</p>
<p>Lancaster Park has been the happiest ground for the Kiwis, where they have achieved nearly half of their 20 home test victories.</p>
<p>New Zealand called up another fast bowler, Heath Davis, after inspecting the wicket. Coach Steve Rixon said it was greener than expected.</p>
<p>Davis, one of the few Maori to play cricket for New Zealand, is considered something of a wild bowler -- very quick but sometimes erratic. But his bowling is far more controlled than in 1994 when he played a test in England and was plagued by a no-ball habit.</p>
<p>He, along with Geoff Allott, played a big role in England's defeat by New Zealand A between the first and second tests.</p>
<p>Allott bowled purposefully and was the quickest bowler on either side when he was called into the team for the second test, and his teaming with Davis could give the New Zealand attack some potency.</p>
<p>New Zealand have hinted they will use four quick bowlers, dropping one of their spinners -- either the 38 year-old Dipak Patel, or left-armer Daniel Vettori, 20 years Patel's junior -- who made a promising debut in Wellington.</p>
<p>They have also dropped the out-of-form Adam Parore for Matt Horne, who is likely to win his first cap.</p>
<p>England are unlikely to change a winning team. Allrounder Craig White could come in for one of the spinners, but both Robert Croft and Phil Tufnell bowled effectively in Wellington.</p>
