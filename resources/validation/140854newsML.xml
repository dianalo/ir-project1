<p>Germany's key metal and engineering industries suffered further disruption on Thursday as tens of thousands of workers staged a second day of nationwide protest against employers' demands that labour costs be reduced.</p>
<p>The protests, which centred on the steel-producing region of North-Rhine Westphalia and engineering companies in the south of the country, went ahead despite pledges by companies not to implement a controversial new law cutting sick pay.</p>
<p>The sectors, which employ 3.5 million workers, had been hit earlier this month by similar stoppages when over 100,000 workers around the country downed tools, costing companies hundreds of millions of marks in lost production.</p>
<p>Steel furnaces run by producers including Thyssen AG and Krupp-Hoesch Stahl were on Thursday affected by protests involving some 10,000 workers overnight and during the morning.</p>
<p>The IG Metall trade union said that furnaces at Duisburg, Bochum and Dortmund in the North-Rhine Westphalia region had been put on emergency running levels due to worker walk-outs.</p>
<p>In the southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg around 3,000 workers on early and day shifts at electronics group Robert Bosch GmbH stopped work to demonstrate outside the factory gates.</p>
<p>Similar protests also went ahead at Daimler-Benz AG's Mercedes luxury car-making plant on the outskirts of Stuttgart and at Volkswagen AG's Audi Neckarsulmer factory, where the Audi workers council said around 5,000 workers stopped work for around an hour.</p>
<p>Engineering workers at telecoms and electronics group Alcatel SEL, a unit of France's Alcatel Alsthom, staged a warning strike at the Nuremberg plant in Bavaria.</p>
<p>The unrest follows the collapse of talks on Wednesday between IG Metall, Germany's largest union, and the Gestamtmetall engineering employers federation.</p>
<p>The two had been seeking a compromise between cuts to non-wage labour costs that employers are demanding and IG Metall's insistence that companies offer firm pledges on job protection in the 1997 pay round.</p>
<p>But discussions foundered as no agreement could be reached on proposed cuts to sick pay from the current 100 percent of salary to 80 percent. Such a cut would save German business some 12 billion marks a year in one go.</p>
<p>Firms including Daimler, General Motors Opel and Siemens AG have, as a result of the earlier protests, said they would hold off from implementing the new sick pay law until contractual agreement with unions had been reached.</p>
<p>Gesamtmetall said on Thursday that the protests would not only cause huge production losses but &quot;do lasting damage to Germany as a place for industry&quot;.</p>
<p>IG Metall in turn said the government and employers' insistence that sick pay and other worker benefits be cut constituted &quot;social dumping&quot; by attacking working conditions.</p>
<p>The latest protests come despite renewed calls by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for the two sides to continue talking about labour costs and wages.</p>
