<p>Croatia will look to Britain to provide it with financial services as it continues to restructure and privatise its economy, Finance Minister Bozo Prka said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;All the roads lead to London. The experience of both our government and private sector show that,&quot; Prka told a seminar organised to promote the expertise of financial firms from the United Kingdom in Croatia.</p>
<p>British insurers such as Lloyd's, legal and financial consultuncy firms were expected to present a wide range of their services for its fast developing post-war economy.</p>
<p>They were also scheduled to meet government officials and representatives of Croatian businesses.</p>
<p>Proposed privatisations of the national oil monopoly INA, telecommunications and energy sector, and future government debt issues open new areas of mutual cooperation, Prka said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will need services of lawyers and auditors to prepare the privatisation of telecoms and INA, through floatation on a foreign bourse in at least one of these cases,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Prka gave no firm time frame for any of those plans, but said Croatia aimed to raise private ownership to 85 percent of the economy in the next two to three years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it would continue to require help in developing what is still a nascent financial market by introducing a whole range of new instruments, and in reforming its pension system.</p>
<p>Insurance and reinsurance services are still limited to a few most basic types and could be expanded, the minister said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is our goal to create a privatised economy...with a high degree of integration with Western Europe and with western economic standards in general,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Analysts believe the government may seek approval in parliament to sell off up to one third in utilies to foreign investors this year and reinvest the money in reconstruction.</p>
<p>New issues of Eurobonds denominated in the local currency, the kuna, and dollars or German marks are also said to be in the pipeline after a successful debut earlier this year.</p>
<p>Croatia already consulted British auditors and legal firms when it prepared leading drugs firm Pliva for privatisation and listing on the London Stock Exchange in 1996.</p>
<p>The government also sought foreign advice before launching its first Eurobonds and has a resident consultant from the U.K. Department of the Treasury, offering technical assistance. -- Kolumbina Bencevic, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075</p>
