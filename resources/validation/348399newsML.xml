<p>Hungary signed an offset protocol on Friday with Lockheed Martin Corp of the United States, one of the bidders to supply Hungary with some 30 fighter aircraft.</p>
<p>No dollar value was given for the offset deal, but one component involves transfering radar component production from Lockheed Martin to Hungarian defence company Arzenal, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;Offsetting the purchase price will be an important criterion when judging the bids,&quot; Hungary's Industry and Trade Minister Szabolcs Fazakas told Reuters after the signing ceremony.</p>
<p>Lockheed Vice President Robert Trice said that although the company's primary aim is to sell F-16s to Hungary, the company is committed to further cooperation.</p>
<p>&quot;We have signed this agreement with the vision that the F-16 will represent one of the most important, but certainly not the only areas of trade between our corporation and Hungary,&quot; Trice said.</p>
<p>Hungary, which is looking to buy some 30 fighters depending on the timing of its expected NATO-membership, has already signed similar offset deals with two other possible bidders.</p>
<p>These are Sweden's Saab, makers of the Gripen, and McDonnell Douglas -Northrop who are offering the F-18.</p>
<p>Industry and Trade Ministry sources said earlier that offset deals with other bidders are also underway.</p>
<p>France's Dassault, which is offering the Mirage 2000, is also expected to sign a deal.</p>
<p>Israel Aircraft Industries presented last May an alternative to the purchases by offering to upgrade Hungary's older MiGs at a fraction of the price of new fighters.</p>
<p>Although other NATO hopefuls, the Czech Republic and Poland, are looking to replace 24 and some 100 fighters respectively, it is unlikely the three countries will strike some sort of block deal with any one supplier, Fazakas said.</p>
<p>&quot;These will be sovereign decisions of sovereign countries, but reason will probably dictate some form of cooperation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hungary has a squadron of 28 MiG-29s that would be operational well into the next century, but its older Soviet-made MiG-21, MiG-23 and Su-22 airplanes need replacement.</p>
