<title>USA: Leading semiconductor index rises to 0.90.</title>
<headline>Leading semiconductor index rises to 0.90.</headline>
<dateline>SAN JOSE 1996-09-10</dateline>

<p>The semiconductor industry's leading indicator rose slightly last month, reflecting a modest increase in new orders, a trade group said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Semiconductor Industry Association said the so-called book to bill ratio, which measures new orders against shipments, rose to 0.90 in August from a revised 0.86 in July.</p>
<p>The index means that for every $100 in shipments, semiconductor firms received $90 in new orders. An index above 1.00 normally means demand for computer chips is expanding while a ratio below one means demand is slowing.  </p>
<p>Industry analysts had expected the ratio to be between 0.86 and 0.92. The July ratio was revised slightly upward from 0.85.</p>
<p>The SIA said new orders rose 0.9 percent last month to $2.84 billion from $2.82 billion in July. The gain was offset by a continuing decline in billings, which fell 3.2 percent to $3.15 billion in August from $3.26 billion in July.</p>
<p>Compared with last year's levels, August chip orders were off 37.8 percent and billings were down 19.9 percent. The book-to-bill ratio in August 1995 was 1.16.  </p>
<p>The semiconductor industry has been hurt this year by a glut in computer chips, particularly in the memory market. In recent months a number of semiconductor makers have scaled back expansion plans or halted construction of new wafer plants until the market improves.</p>
<p>Analysts say August is usually the weakest month of the year because many manufacturers shut down for vacation. Thus, an increase in orders during August could signal the beginning of a cyclical upturn.</p>
<p>The last two weeks of September are when PC makers start shipping their products for the holiday season and most of them order semiconductors &quot;just-in-time&quot; often only days before they are scheduled for the assembly line.</p>
<p>The SIA said book-to-bill numbers in the other major market sectors -- Japan, Asia and Europe -- remain higher than in the North and South American market. The final worldwide book-to-bill ratio for July, the latest period available, rose to 0.95 from 0.93 in June. Japan's book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1.02 in July.</p>
