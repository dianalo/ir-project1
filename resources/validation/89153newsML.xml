<p>French Prime Minister Alain Juppe will have no problem winning a confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday, but it will not stop sniping within his centre-right coalition against his unpopular government's policies.</p>
<p>Juppe called the vote to force his fractious coalition to line up behind him at the start of a new parliamentary session that will have to adopt an austerity budget for 1997 amid widespread public gloom over record unemployment.</p>
<p>Since the coalition controls four-fifths of the 577 National Assembly seats, the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Only two dissident coalition deputies have announced they will vote against the government.</p>
<p>President Jacques Chirac had to intervene last week to shield his premier from mounting criticism in their Gaullist RPR party. He made a spirited public defence of the government on Monday, urging it to stay the course while making a better job of explaining its policies.</p>
<p>Juppe, who will open the two-hour confidence debate with a policy statement (starting at 1400 GMT), has appealed to RPR legislators to back the government &quot;not just with a vote cast half-heartedly, at arm's length...but with the sincere and frank support of hearts and minds&quot;.</p>
<p>He invited some of his critics, including former budget minister Nicolas Sarkozy and veteran parliamentarian Pierre Mazeaud to private meetings in his office on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But political commentators say the confidence motion ritual will not help him overcome deep misgivings in the coalition about his economic policies and recent initiatives to introduce a new anti-racism law and change the electoral system.</p>
<p>The opposition Socialists have denounced the exercise in advance as a farce, saying that a vote of support for Juppe would just show how unrepresentative parliament had become of the French electorate.</p>
<p>Juppe's public approval rating has slumped close to the record lows of around 30 percent it reached after a 24-day public transport strike last year.</p>
<p>His effort to overcome a national mood of gloom over the economic slowdown, stagnating purchasing power and record 12.6 percent unemployment by announcing a package of income tax cuts backfired badly last month.</p>
<p>Voters quickly realised they would be paying more in local taxation and duty on tobacco and alcohol.</p>
<p>Chirac's own popularity is at its lowest since he took office in May 1995.</p>
<p>Much attention on Wednesday will focus on what Juppe says in his policy statement about two initiatives he announced in September which face strong opposition in the coalition.</p>
<p>Both RPR back-benchers and leaders of the junior coalition party, the UDF, have expressed doubt about the wisdom of a draft anti-racism bill to make it easier to prosecute anti-immigration crusader Jean-Marie Le Pen for espousing racial inequality.</p>
<p>And influential figures in both parties have opposed Juppe's suggestion of adding a &quot;dose&quot; of proportional representation to the voting system for the 1998 general election -- a move that would let Le Pen's extreme-right National Front into parliament.</p>
<p>Rene Monory, the influential UDF speaker of the Senate, the upper house of parliament, joined the chorus of criticism on Tuesday, saying it would look like trickery to tinker with the electoral system at this late stage.</p>
