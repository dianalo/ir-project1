<text>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's said on Tuesday it assigned its AA financial strength rating to Abbey National Life Plc (ANL).  </p>
<p>S&amp;P released the following statement:</p>
<p>&quot;This rating, which is the same as that assigned to sister company Scottish Mutual Assurance plc (SMA), is based on ANL's position as a core member of the Abbey National Group of companies, its efficient operations, good investment performance and good capitalization. ANL is however, at an early stage of development, having commenced business only in 1993, and it has a limited business franchise outside the Abbey National customer base.</p>
<p>MAJOR RATING FACTORS:</p>
<p>-- ANL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbey National plc (senior debt rating double-A'), one of the largest and strongest U.K. clearing banks and mortgage lenders. Standard &amp; Poor's believes that Abbey National is seeking to obtain a significant proportion of its income from life insurance operations. Consequently ANL was set up in February 1993 to sell life insurance and more recently, unit trust products through the Abbey National branch network. ANL's sales function is integrated with that of the Group's other retail products, targeting the same customer base with the same brand name. There are also strong management links between ANL and its parent; hence Standard &amp; Poor's regards ANL as a core operation of Abbey National.</p>
<p>-- ANL is diversifying away from the potentially cyclical mortgage related business, which dominated its early sales, and is now marketing a wider range of products - in 1995 it sold a large volume of single premium investment bonds and, through a subsidiary, unit trusts.</p>
<p>-- For a new operation, ANL has already attained a good volume of new business, writing equivalent annual premiums of UK60.1 million in 1995. This was only slightly lower than the 1994 figure of UK62.6 million, while the UK market overall fell by 17% in 1995. Moreover, including unit trusts and Peps, 1995 new business rose by 25% to UK80.5 million, and Standard &amp; Poor's believes that ANL will continue to gain market share in 1996. These robust results through a difficult market reflect the distributive power of the Abbey National branch network, and the degree of customer affinity.</p>
<p>-- ANL benefits from an extremely low expense ratio, particularly for a company which must be considered to be in its development stage. The total expense ratio improved to 11.5% in 1995 from 15.2% in 1994, essentially due to the company's ability to spread costs over a larger book of business. ANL has a lower cost base than many traditional insurers due to the absence of a separate salesforce - ANL distributes through the existing Abbey National branch network and more recently through a telesales operation, and staff do not receive commissions. Moreover, all administration and fund management costs are shared with Scottish Mutual, giving both companies the scale economies of a top ten office. By utilizing the established infrastructure of SMA, ANL's startup costs have therefore been modest.</p>
<p>-- ANL has low capital requirements as most business is unit-linked, and as the unitized with-profits business is heavily reassured with SMA. As a result, coverage of the minimum margin is good at 2.9 times, unchanged during the year. The nonlinked free asset ratio, at 50.4% in 1995, is one of the strongest in the sector, reflecting the effect of initial seed capital.</p>
<p>-- Investment performance is good, with 75% of life and pensions funds having performed within the first quartile over the past three years. Investment risk in the non-linked portfolio is low, with assets comprising cash and government bonds.</p>
<p>-- Whilst ANL has grown very quickly, its market position is modest with a market share of 1.3% in 1995. ANL now faces the challenge to continue to grow the book of business, penetrate the Abbey National customer base of 12 million more fully, retain business through continued good investment performance and potentially to increase the volume of business outside of the mortgage related field.</p>
<p>EXPECTATIONS:</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's expects capitalization to remain at a good level, noting the relatively low risks retained by the company. Market position will be protected to a degree by the large customer base of Abbey National, but consistent sales growth may be difficult to achieve given the cyclicality of the housing market and the volatility of certain single premium business. ANL has the potential to improve efficiency further as the business grows, Standard &amp; Poor's said.</p>
