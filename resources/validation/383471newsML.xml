<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe accused French artists and intellectuals on Monday of playing into the hands of the far right after they appealed for civil disobedience on an immigration bill.</p>
<p>Many intellectuals say the cabinet-sanctioned draft bill mirrors the ideas of the anti-immigration National Front and is meant to show voters that the centre-right government can do just as well as the Front in cracking down on foreigners.</p>
<p>Juppe told RTL radio the protesters had made a confused cocktail of a Front victory in the southern town of Vitrolles a week ago, an attempt by the Front mayor in Toulon to sack a theatre director, and the immigration bill.</p>
<p>&quot;These (petitions) are serious acts because they undermine the state and democracy,&quot; Juppe told RTL radio, ruling out any change in the bill which he said included generously humane measures for immigrants.</p>
<p>&quot;The role of intellectuals is to lobby for the truth, not to obscure it. It is also a blow against our policy of integration...Many people don't want to make the difference between legal and illegal immigration. They are doing the work of those who advocate xenophobia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Protests have included publication of separate lists of hundreds of scientists, artists, doctors and actors calling on the public to flout the new law if it is voted by parliament later this month.</p>
<p>Signatories include actresses Jeanne Moreau, Catherine Deneuve and Carole Bouquet, and film-makers Bernard Tavernier and Mathieu Kassovitz.</p>
<p>The left-leaning daily Liberation published 3,000 signatures from the intellectual and arts elite, alongside 54 drawings by leading cartoonists. One showed Asterix the Gaul kicking over a cauldron marked &quot;Marechal here we are&quot;, a rallying cry for wartime collaborationist leader Marechal Philippe Petain.</p>
<p>&quot;Intellectuals should rather work with us (against the Front), in educating people,&quot; Juppe said, again branding Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen &quot;racist, xenophobe and anti-Semitic&quot;.</p>
<p>Communist leader Robert Hue urged leftist parties to back the intellectuals. &quot;Making hosts declare whether their guests are staying or not is extremely serious. It's informing,&quot; he told Europe-1 radio.</p>
<p>The bill will require people supplying certificates to foreigners saying they will take responsibility for them during their stay in France also to declare when their guests leave. Juppe denied it provided for any register of foreigners.</p>
<p>Would-be visitors from many Third World countries who cannot show they have enough money to fund a long visit to France are currently granted visas only if they can provide a certificate showing someone in France will provide them with lodging.</p>
<p>The new article, like the certificates before them, are aimed at discouraging would-be illegal immigrants of which there are an estimated one million in France. There are a further four million foreigners legally resident in the country.</p>
<p>An IPSOS opinion poll for the daily Le Figaro showed that 66 percent of voters distanced themselves from the National Front's ideas on immigration, against 28 percent who did not.</p>
