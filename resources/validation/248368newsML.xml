<headline>Reebok sees sales for rest of 1996 down.</headline>

<p>Reebok International Ltd Chief Executive Officer Paul Fireman said on Wednesday he expected sales of the Stoughton, Mass.-based athletic apparel maker's products to continue sliding for the remainder of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The remainder of 1996 we will continue to see sliding sales,&quot; Fireman told Reuters after the Reebok Human Rights Awards ceremonies in Boston.  &quot;That's to be expected as it's old product.&quot;</p>
<p>But he expected sales to &quot;grow again in the second quarter of '97.  I expect to grow again and be back where we belong for the remainder of next year.&quot;  </p>
<p>Fireman said he expects the introduction of a new product, DMX2000 athletic shoes, in April will spark sales activity.</p>
<p>He said the difference in the quality and result &quot;are totally felt and experienced by anyone who has worn them.&quot;</p>
<p>He blamed the poor sales performance on poor products. &quot;We produced poor products for the last three years.  We lost our focus,&quot; Fireman said.  &quot;But over the last 18 months, especially over the last 12 months, I have almost exclusively focused on products.&quot;  </p>
<p>Four new products that were introduced over the past 12 months, including a Shaquille O'Neal sneaker &quot;were being blown out of the stores,&quot; Fireman said, but he conceded that most of the Reebok atheletic shoes at the retail level were &quot;still the old product line.&quot;</p>
<p>High technology products will be the engine that drives Reebok's growth, Fireman said, adding that he expected to recover market share lost to Nike Inc in the next two to three years.</p>
