<headline>THE PROTEUS COLUMN - CHINA. AON CALL CENTRE.</headline>
<text>
<p>Aetna, Cigna and TransAmerica are eagerly awaiting their chance to exploit China's potential insurance market.</p>
<p>Each has lobbied the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to convince it they meet its strict requirements for gaining access. Under the regulations, firms looking to insure in China must be certified as world class, having three credentials before being granted licences: US$5 billion in assets, at least 30 years in business and liaison offices in the country for three years.</p>
<p>They are now awaiting approval of licences opening the way to the big prize -- breaking into life insurance.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>Aon has opened a direct call centre with 1,000 staff in Fort Wayne in what may be an indicator of the growth of direct response to sell insurance.</p>
<p>The direct method became hugely successful as a means of selling personal lines insurance in Britain after Direct Line opened for business in 1985, turning the selling of all financial services including loans and mortgages, upsidedown.</p>
<p>Similar experiments have taken off in Germany, Switzerland and Spain, and a few market watchers think the same will happen in the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. insurers are still heavily linked to networks of local agents. These are expensive, but insurance company executives remain convinced that customers want to deal with &quot;the guy at the end of the street&quot;.</p>
<p>Others believe a large section of the U.S. public, particularly in cities where people tend to be short on time, will be happy to sort their auto and household insurance over the telephone call. If so, a revolution of the U.S. personal finance sector may be on the way.</p>
