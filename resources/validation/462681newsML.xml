<p>The parliamentary finance committee on Monday endorsed the 1997/98 budget, but warned that financial management would have to be tightened throughout government to meet stringent deficit cutting targets.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, it is generally a good budget with many positive features, but in order to be able to achieve even the four- percent budget deficit, it is really going to require a lot of effective management in the actual spending agencies,&quot; committee chairman Sipho Mpahlwa told reporters.  </p>
<p>The committee's report, which is a parliamentary requirement, but has no effect on the budget presented by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel earlier this month, said the budget &quot;balances the need for fiscal discipline with the urgent imperative for transformatory social spending.&quot;</p>
<p>The committee said the budget again highlighted the commitment to reducing the budget deficit, but this was &quot;not just a stark choice between deficit spending and deficit reduction.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;It also addresses the problem of wastage and ineffective spending within departments, while also accelerating reprioritisation.&quot;</p>
<p>The committee welcomed the relaxation of exchange controls and hoped it would enable South Africans to make a larger contribution to the development of the Southern African region. It also hoped the tight control of public finances and lower private sector credit extension would result in lower real interest rates.  </p>
<p>The committee rejected a call by the Congress of South African Trade Unions for the resignation of State Expenditure Director-General Hannes Smit for being a stumbling block to the budget reform process. He had said it would take up to 15 years to fully implement budget reform.</p>
<p>The committee commended moves to cut public debt and improve debt management, but warned that moves to reduce the deficit should be &quot;very carefully managed to prevent ad hoc, quick-fix expenditure cuts.&quot;</p>
<p>The move to multi-year budgeting would help deal with the continual problem of rollovers of unspent funds from one budget year to the next.</p>
<p>&quot;On budget reform, we believe that some progress has been made, but there is general agreement that the process should move faster,&quot; Mpahlwa said.</p>
