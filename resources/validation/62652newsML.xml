<headline>British pension giant bets on stocks crash - paper.</headline>

<p>A leading British pension management group is so sure stock markets are about to crash that it has built up a huge cash mountain despite criticism from clients, the Guardian newspaper said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It said PDFM Ltd, which controls funds worth 50 billion pounds ($78 billion), had amassed a cash pile of seven billion pounds ($11 billion) since January 1995, when it decided to keep 15 percent of its assets in cash.</p>
<p>In that period London's FT all-share index has risen by a third, effectively costing PDFM Ltd three billion pounds ($4.5 billion), the Guardian said.</p>
<p>PDFM Ltd marketing director Paul Yates said despite criticism from some major clients for underperforming the market, the firm would stick to its guns and continue to reduce share holdings.</p>
<p>&quot;The degree of over-valuation in the UK and U.S. stock markets is unprecedented,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had a lot of work explaining our strategy to clients. We have had a very difficult year. But in the longer term people know we have got things right and if we changed tack now, half our clients would probably walk out.&quot;</p>
<p>PDFM Ltd is part of the investment banking conglomerate Union Bank of Switzerland.</p>
