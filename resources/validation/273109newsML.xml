<p>The European Union on Monday expressed optimism that Hong Kong would hold fair and open elections after Britain returns it to China next year, and pledged to closely monitor events in the territory after 1997.</p>
<p>European Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan made the comment after a China-controlled 400-member caucas on Saturday picked members for a provisional legislature for the territory to replace the current elected lawmaking chamber upon the handover.</p>
<p>The British colony reverts to China next July 1 and becomes a Chinese Special Adminstrative Region (SAR) governed by a chief executive, with the Basic Law as the constitution.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome the generally accepted working hypothesis that further elections will take place in the SAR at an early date, within the framework set by the Basic Law,&quot; Brittan said in a statement issued in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;We trust that this will happen in a matter of months after handover, and that those elections will be both fair and open,&quot; he added. &quot;We shall follow closely events in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.&quot;</p>
<p>Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten and British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind have denounced China's plan to disband Hong Kong's elected legislature after Beijing takes back the territory. The United States also called China's move to disband the legislature &quot;unjustified and unnecessary&quot;.</p>
<p>Democrats have condemned the selection of provisional legislature members, in which the people had no vote, as undemocratic and unrepresentative. Some fear the newly formed body will clash with the current chamber before the handover.</p>
<p>&quot;I think all would agree that it will be important for this development not to distract from the continued smooth working of the current institutions of Hong Kong between now and 30 June 1997,&quot; Brittan said.</p>
<p>&quot;The key test for the future body will be its success in meeting the aspirations of the Hong Kong people and in working successfully with the chief executive within the legal framework already established,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The EU had a strong interest in a stable and prosperous future for Hong Kong people, while the European Council's December meeting in Dublin recalled in particular its full support for the rights of SAR citizens to live under demoncratic representative institutions, Brittan noted. 231434 GMT dec 96</p>
