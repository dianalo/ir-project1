<p>British Airways Plc said on Friday would launch a 60 million pounds ($97.5 million) overhaul of its livery and corporate identity next Tuesday, with a series of events across the world.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be launching it in a way which reflects the airline we are....a global airline, with simultaneuous events in a number of places around the world...at 1200 GMT,&quot; a spokesman said.</p>
<p>BA is keeping details of the facelift under wraps till then. But, the company promised a radical change to its airborne image, which will be the first overhaul since it swapped the national flag for its rather sombre livery of dark blue, red and grey in 1984, when the airline was being prepared for privatisation.</p>
<p>The new design cost BA about two million pounds but it will have to spend far more making the changes, which include repainting its fleet of 300 aircraft.</p>
<p>Implementing it will cost around 60 million pounds over three years,&quot; a company official said. &quot;But a lot of that money we would have had to spend in any event because aircraft are repainted every five years.&quot;</p>
<p>Recent newspaper reports said BA planned to drop the formality and instead follow the example of some foreign rivals in letting artists loose on its tailfins.</p>
<p>To save costs, BA recently repainted 40 aircraft in &quot;interim livery&quot; of pearl white, with a lighter blue underbelly.</p>
<p>The airline had said it was not dropping the British Airways brand but wanted to become more international in its image as it pressed ahead with its aim to become a global airline.</p>
<p>&quot;People will have to wait until Tuesday,&quot; said the spokesman. It &quot;will reflect the fact that we are a British company but a British company where 60 percent of its customers come from outside the United Kingdom.&quot;</p>
