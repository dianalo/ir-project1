<p>Algeria, fighting a vicious war against Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas, attacked Britain on Wednesday for allowing Islamist groups to meet in London.</p>
<p>The Islamist gathering, due to be held in London on September 8, has triggered concern and anger in several other Arab countries like Egypt which is also fighting armed Moslem fundamentalists.</p>
<p>British Jewish groups have also voiced protest because they said Palestinian Islamist Hamas as well as the banned Algerian Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) are among those radical Islamists attending the conference.</p>
<p>A foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement read on Algerian television that Algeria &quot;has received with concern the information over a meeting of terrorist groups working against the interests of the Arab and Islamic world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Algeria expresses its sharp rejection of a meeting putting together masterminds and ideologists and financers of terrorism,&quot; the spokesman said, adding the Algerian government has asked the British embassy in Algiers for clarifications.</p>
<p>The Algerian ambassador in London has also asked for clarification from the Foreign Office over the meeting of Islamist groups. Algeria said &quot;they are clearly working to undermine the stability&quot; of Arab countries.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Tuesday from Pakistan his government would only take action against the planned Islamists gathering in London if British law was broken.</p>
<p>&quot;People who wish to hold conferences of course don't need to seek permission from the government in Britain,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>An estimated 50,000 people, including more than 110 foreigners, have been killed in Algeria's violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 when authorities in Algeria cancelled a general election in which FIS had taken a commanding lead.</p>
