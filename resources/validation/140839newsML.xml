<p>The European Parliament, angered by Turkey's human rights record, voted on Thursday to block hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to help Ankara set up a customs union with the European Union.</p>
<p>In a first reading of the 1997 EU budget, the 626-member parliament voted to focus aid on human rights organisations, independent aid agencies and measures to promote democracy.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to ensure that civil society and process of democracy in Turkey is not hampered,&quot; Detlev Samland, head of the parliament's budgetary committee, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Turkey dismissed the vote.</p>
<p>&quot;Turkey is not affected by these kind of things,&quot; the state-run Anatolian news agency quoted Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen as saying. Oymen said the EU aid was minimal compared to Turkey's export earnings.</p>
<p>The EU planned to set aside 375 million Ecus ($470 million) between 1996 and 2000 to help Turkey put in place its customs union with the 15-member bloc.</p>
<p>The customs union offers Turkey lucrative trade openings.</p>
<p>Parliament approved the creation of the customs union last December only after the Ankara government had given explicit guarantees that it would take positive action on human rights, democratisation, Cyprus and the plight of the Kurds.</p>
<p>But the Euro MPs complained that Turkey had failed to honour these commitments, saying Ankara had created tension by &quot;provocations in the Aegean Sea and Cyprus and aggression in northern Iraq&quot;.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Euro MPs strongly condemned the fourth killing in recent months of a unarmed Greek Cypriot by Turkish forces and called on Ankara to respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Greek Cypriots.</p>
<p>EU External Relations Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek also expressed grave concern about Turkey's actions on Monday.</p>
<p>In addition, the parliament voted to review substantial financing for Turkey from the EU's MEDA programme, through which up to 842 million Ecus was envisaged for the bloc's Mediterranean neighbours in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Before projects are allocated to Turkey they should be approved by parliament,&quot; Samland said.</p>
<p>At the moment it is impossible to say how much of MEDA funds for Turkey would be blocked, the German Social Democrat added.</p>
<p>The parliament will have a second and final reading of the 1997 EU budget in December.</p>
