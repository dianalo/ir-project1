<p>Tough talk by the European Monetary Institute on the need for better budget discipline failed on Tuesday to unnerve financial markets, which continued to bet on convergence trades for a single European currency.</p>
<p>&quot;It's giving out a modest warning for countries in terms of meeting the deficit criteria, but that's not a surprise,&quot; said Mary Bloem, Ecu and EMU bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets in London. &quot;We're used to the EMI taking a tough stance.&quot;</p>
<p>The EMI, forerunner to the European Central Bank, said many European countries needed to get their books in order.</p>
<p>&quot;On the fiscal side, the situation remains far from satisfactory in many countries,&quot; EMI President Alexandre Lamfalussy wrote in a foreword to the EMI's annual report.</p>
<p>Lamfalussy said sustainable convergence could not be achieved through one-off and accounting measures, adding that countries were relying too much on revenues to reduce deficit ratios, rather than on spending cuts.</p>
<p>The euro single currency, as part of the final phase of European economic and monetary union (EMU), is scheduled to be introduced in January 1999.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange analysts said the report threw some cold water on renewed enthusiasm for EMU convergence plays in the short term but it was not enough to reverse such sentiment entirely.</p>
<p>&quot;The EMI has fired a warning shot to tell the markets that a lot of work is still to be done but it didn't contain much to change the overall market view on EMU,&quot; said Lee Ferridge, currency strategist at Commerzbank in London.</p>
<p>Bloem of Paribas said the report, since it was designed foremost as an analysis on the EMI's own performance rather than an economic critique, was not weighty enough to shake up markets.</p>
<p>The only point in the report she believed noteworthy was on inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing perhaps is that the EMI does see growth picking up this year and certain upward risks to European inflation,&quot; Bloem said.</p>
<p>Convergence trades, where investors bet yields in peripheral European countries will converge with those in core Europe such as benchmark Bunds, were a dominant theme in 1996 for markets. But the tone has been more mixed so far in 1997.</p>
<p>After worries began to creep into the market about a possible delay to EMU -- as doubt was cast not only on countries such as Italy but also on Germany -- the yield spreads for Italian and Spanish debt widened.</p>
<p>But lately, the market has taken a more upbeat view on EMU's chances, partly on speculation Germany will soften its stance on how rigidly the Maastricht criteria need to be applied.</p>
<p>At heart, is the deficit to gross domestic product ratio which under Maastricht is supposed to be no more than three percent for member countries. Many forecasters say Germany could miss this target in 1997, the key year for judging EMU members.</p>
<p>But Stephen Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International in London, said the EMI report did not hit home, partly because it is based on old data.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the day it (EMU) is still a political decision based on 1997 data, not 1996 data,&quot; he said. &quot;Although some of the concerns are quite valid it (the report) doesn't take us very much forward in terms of what the risks are.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said longer-term convergence trades were still on track, especially given current market factors such as dollar strength and a sense of strong political will for EMU.</p>
<p>European debt spreads were mixed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>At 1045 GMT, the Italian 10-year BTP/Bund spread was 167 basis points, down slightly from 169 late on Monday. The Spanish spread was at 95 basis points, compared with 93 on Monday.</p>
