<p>Europe's stock markets happily climbed aboard the Wall Street bandwagon as it began driving upwards more than two years ago and have been carried higher by the U.S. market's advance ever since.</p>
<p>But as fears grow that the Dow might be heading towards a precipice, Europe's investors are suddenly hoping that they are not, after all, mere passengers on a U.S.-driven journey.</p>
<p>With several analysts warning of a substantial Wall Street correction this year, the issue of how much European equities have 'decoupled' from the U.S. locomotive is being anxiously examined.</p>
<p>&quot;The key concern that people have is that if the U.S. goes down, what will that do to Europe?&quot; said Richard Davidson, European equity strategist at Morgan Stanley in London.</p>
<p>If European markets remain closely tied to the U.S. one, then a Wall Street plunge would drag Europe with it. But some analysts believe the two areas have decoupled enough to shelter Europe from the worst of the damage if the Dow loses its footing.</p>
<p>Supporters of the decoupling argument point to the divergence between the positions of Europe and the United States in the economic cycle.</p>
<p>U.S. data shows continued economic strength and most analysts expect the next move in interest rates there to be upwards. Meanwhile, Germany, economic powerhouse of Europe, struggles with slack output and rising unemployment.</p>
<p>&quot;The gap between U.S. and German bond yields is exceptionally high, largely reflecting the different cyclical positions in the U.S. and Germany,&quot; said Bill O'Neill, international investment strategist at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>This divergence in bond performance has pushed European and U.S. equity/bond yield ratios in different directions. And the higher bond yields are compared to equities, the more vulnerable stock markets are to investors switching into bonds.</p>
<p>At the time of the 1987 market crash, yield ratios looked stretched in both Europe and the United States and the current difference in the ratios &quot;argues for far greater divergence&quot; in equity performance on either side of the Atlantic, the Financial Times said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Davidson at Morgan Stanley said the correlation between U.S. and European equity market performance had already waned considerably and this could help Europe weather storms ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets have already significantly decoupled,&quot; he said. &quot;Although I'm bearish on Europe in absolute terms, I'd expect it to outperform the U.S. if Wall Street goes down.&quot;</p>
<p>Davidson said the correlation between equity markets in the U.S. and Europe had fallen to its lowest since the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>He said his research had shown that out of 11 U.S. corrections of 10 percent or more since 1970, Europe had outperformed every time in dollar terms.</p>
<p>Corporate restructuring in Europe would help support the performance of its equity markets, Davidson said. &quot;The U.S. powered ahead because of its corporate restructuring story. Now we've got the European restructuring story coming through and Europe should outperform the U.S.&quot;</p>
<p>O'Neill also believes Europe would outperform a falling Wall Street but said everything hinged on the strength of the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;If the dollar holds up solidly, our belief would be that European equity markets should outperform a weakening U.S. equity market,&quot; O'Neill said.</p>
<p>But Ian Scott, European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers, said that although he did not foresee a U.S. tumble, it would take Europe with it if it did materialise.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not in the doom-and-gloom camp on the U.S.,&quot; he said. &quot;But we wouldn't see Europe sheltered if Wall Street falls.&quot;</p>
<p>Scott said he believed bond market performance would turn in favour of U.S. equities. &quot;Bond market trends have been divergent this year -- U.S. yields have been rising while European yields have been flat to lower,&quot; he said. &quot;But we would see that turning round, with the U.S. starting to outperform.&quot;</p>
<p>Britain presents a special case, analysts say -- it is closer to the U.S. in terms of its position in the economic cycle but its bond market performance has been more closely correlated to German Bunds than U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>&quot;The valuation rate of equities compared to gilts is still very comfortable for the UK,&quot; O'Neill said. &quot;The risk there arises out of domestic developments.&quot;</p>
<p>By no means all analysts believe a Wall Street correction is on the way -- many see the bull market continuing this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously we're hoping to see Wall Street continuing upwards and there's no real reason why it shouldn't,&quot; one British dealer said. &quot;But these decoupling arguments are reassuring, just in case.&quot;</p>
