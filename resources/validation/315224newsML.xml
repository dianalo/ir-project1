<p>Caution ruled Indian stock markets on Friday as local funds were among the major sellers in pivotal stocks in active trade, brokers said.</p>
<p>End-of-account trade at the country's premier bourse, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), put pressure on marketmen to offload huge positions built up in pivotal stocks, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Speculators are unwinding positions...,&quot; said chief dealer Sanjeev Choithani at brokerage Pashupati Advani.</p>
<p>The top 30-share BSE index closed 33.53 points, or 0.97 percent down at 3,422.35, off 3480.98 after tumbling 191 points or over five percent on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The sharp price volatility prompted the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to convene a closed-door meeting with the chiefs of major exchanges on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;While the exchanges are themselves looking into the unusual volatility in the market, SEBI too is collecting necessary information across the exchanges for analysis and would examine if any further action is needed,&quot; the market regulator said in a statement released after the meeting.</p>
<p>Optimism that the government was preparing moves to reverse slowing industrial growth and to jump-start markets ignited heavy speculative bidding in blue chip stocks.  </p>
<p>Trading volumes at the BSE slumped to 7.75 billion rupees from 11.77 billion rupees on the previous day.</p>
<p>&quot;Some sort of correction was necessary to make the market healthier. We are likely to see institutional interest at lower levels,&quot; said Maulik Sharedalal member-broker of the BSE.</p>
<p>ACC lost 155.55 rupees to 1,422.25, MTNL 12.20 to 234.0, ITC 4.75 to 395.0 and TELCO 8.0 to 337.0. Some stocks however ended in positive territory. SBI rose 9.0 rupees to 278.0, TISCO 1.0 to 190.0 and Reliance 3.75 to 238.75.</p>
