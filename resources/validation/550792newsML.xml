<p>COMEX copper ended firmer as the LME backwardation surged again amid the beginning of a second strike in Chile's copper mining sector.</p>
<p>Workers at Quebrada Blanca, which produces 75,000 tonnes of cathode a year, went on strike Wednesday after negotiations failed, local union president Nelson Fuentes said.</p>
<p>A small group of workers at the huge Escondida mine, also in Chile, have been on strike for over a week and a half.</p>
<p>The cash to three months London backwardation bounced back Wednesday by more than $20 to end at $86/$90.</p>
<p>July COMEX settled 1.80 cents firmer at 111.35 cents per pound, traded 111.70 to 108.15 cents. Spot May went out 1.95 cents higher at 112.50 cents.</p>
<p>The market was unsettled overnight by a sharp hike in LME stocks Wednesday, the first hefty increase for weeks. Stocks rose 2,675 tonnes to 143,750 tonnes.</p>
<p>Some traders had said the big surge in LME backwardation to over $200 last week would inevitably draw in some inventory, particularly from COMEX depots after LME cash went to a premium over spot COMEX.</p>
<p>COMEX stocks fell 1,365 short tons Wednesday to 49,520 tons.</p>
<p>ASARCO's chairman Richard de J Osborne reiterated at the company's annual meeting in New York Wednesday that the copper market would end this and next year in deficits of 53,000 short tons and 149,000 short tons respectively.</p>
<p>Western world copper inventories were down to 2.6 weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no buffer now,&quot; Osborne said.</p>
<p>Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential Securities said news that Metallgesellschaft's trading arm was buying Cerro Sales of the U.S., which would create a powerful physical copper trader, especially in the domestic market, helped to push up tags.</p>
<p>&quot;This suggested that copper was going to go into strong hands. It sounded bullish for copper,&quot; Raptopoulos said.</p>
<p>The U.S. is the world's biggest consumer of red metal.</p>
