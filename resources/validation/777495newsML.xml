<p>Hong Kong stocks rebounded in early Monday trading after opening easier following Wall Street's lower close on Friday on a spate of strong U.S. economic data, brokers said.</p>
<p>The blue chip Hang Seng Index rose 51 points, or 0.31 percent, to 16,430 after erasing a 82 point loss in the opening minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;The rebound is led by properties as investors believe that the local property market has bottomed out and end-users have started to enter the market to buy flats,&quot; said Peter Lai, associate director at OCBC Securities.</p>
<p>Some property developers have cut prices on new flat sales and this made people believe that the government would not take drastic measures to curb prices, Lai said.</p>
<p>Cheung Kong added HK$0.50 to HK$87.75 and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose HK$0.50 to HK$101.50.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading volume is quite good so far but it's too early to say whether the Hang Seng could hit new high today,&quot; Lai added.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng posted an intra-day record of 16,449.53 last Friday.</p>
<p>Hongkong Telecom added HK$0.15 to HK$19.95 on derivatives-linked trading, brokers said.</p>
<p>HSBC Holdings was down HK$1.00 at HK$267.00 and Hang Seng Bank was unchanged at HK$112.50 ahead of their interim result announcements due later in the day.</p>
<p>&quot;The market generally expect good earnings for the banks so there is no major selling seen in the counters today,&quot; said Antony Mak, sales director at Vickers Ballas.</p>
<p>Dickson rose HK$0.65 to HK$27.50 on optimism that it would win in a bid for U.S. clothing retailer Barney's Inc, brokers said.</p>
<p>Barney's is to announce the successful bidder later today and Dickson will hold a new conference this afternoon.</p>
<p>Chevalier OA International Ltd surged HK$0.73, or 72 percent, to a year high of HK$1.74 before steadying at HK$1.52, up HK$0.51.</p>
<p>Buying was fuelled by news that the China State Council backed China Everbright Technology Ltd's plan to take a 10 percent stake in Chevalier OA, Mak said.</p>
<p>Red-chips and H-shares were slightly up on selective buying.</p>
<p>Shanghai Haixing rose HK$0.35 to HK$5.70 and Yizheng added HK$0.225 to HK$2.85. The two counters were driven by news that their mainland parents were planning corporate restructurings.</p>
