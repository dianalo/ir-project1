<p>DOWNER POSTPONES CAMBODIA TRIP</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has cancelled next month's visit to Cambodia, to avoid appearing to endorse the coup by Hun Sen.</p>
<p>The move follows the Federal Government's decision on Monday to suspend Australia's military aid to Cambodia.</p>
<p>Mr Downer was scheduled to visit Cambodia early next month, but a spokesman said it is now inappropriate given Australia's concern at the violent way Hun Sen ousted Cambodia's first Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.</p>
<p>He said Mr Downer is also concerned at the appointment of Cambodia's Foreign Minister Ung Huot to replace Prince Ranariddh, and is investigating to ensure the selection was made freely and fairly, and that Ung Huot was not unduly pressured.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Mr Downer still hopes to visit Cambodia, but it may now not be until next year.</p>
<p>Ung Huot, who has dual Australian nationality, is due to be endorsed as first Prime Minister by Cambodia's National Assembly later this month.</p>

<p>GOVT'S INDUSTRY BACKFLIP PRAISED</p>
<p>The Federal Government's finally got the message on the need for industry assistance, according to Australia's manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Manufactures said the government's done a complete somersault on its previous policies of not intervening in industry, and cutting assistance programs.</p>
<p>The praise came after comments by Industry Minister John Moore yesterday, proposing new tax breaks to attract foreign investment, and support by the Prime Minister for setting up free trade zones.</p>
<p>The chamber's chief executive Allan Handberg told ABC Radio the government's shift offers a ray of hope.</p>
<p>&quot;It's good to see the government...is sending signals that they've entered the real world,&quot; Mr Handberg said.</p>
<p>&quot;They recognise they have a responsibility to set up an environment that's conducive to business proceeding, not to intervene in the actual business itself, but to intervene to make sure their long term aspirations can be achieved.&quot;</p>
<p>The Metal Trades Industry Association has also welcomed the apparent shift in government policy on industry assistance.</p>
<p>Association chief executive Bob Herbert said the government's starting to read the signs that Australia needs to map out a specific direction for industry into the next millennium.</p>
<p>He told ABC Radio other countries are getting their industry policies right, and Australia must do the same.</p>
<p>&quot;Other countries are doing this with great success, you only need to see what Ireland and Wales and Malaysia and Singapore have done because they have a direction which is 10, 20 years forward, we need to do the same,&quot; Mr Herbert said.</p>
<p>&quot;They're attracting the investment because there is this huge international competition for investment these days, Australia's got to get into that game.&quot;</p>

<p>GREEN GAMES CONCERNS CRITICISED</p>
<p>The Olympic Co-ordination Authority is accusing green groups of damaging Australia by publicly raising their concerns about pollution at the games site.</p>
<p>The Authority's Director-General David Richmond said Greenpeace and Greengames Watch have been irresponsible.</p>
<p>Mr Richmond said every effort is being made to properly clean-up the Olympic site at Homebush.</p>
<p>He said if environmental groups have new information about the extent of the pollution, they should speak directly with his authority rather than through the media.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly the kind of negativeness and the way in which the green groups have decided to approach the issue of their concerns about any risk associated with contamination at the Homebush Bay site...does damage to Australia,&quot; Mr Richmond said. Greenpeace and Green Games Watch 2000 should play a more constructive role in Olympic preparations, so that the best possible environmental outcomes are reached, he said.</p>

<p>BIGGEST ANTI-HANSON RALLY YET EXPECTED IN GEELONG</p>
<p>Police have kept their tactics secret ahead of what protest groups expect will be a big anti-Pauline Hanson vigil tonight at Geelong, west of Melbourne.</p>
<p>But it has been confirmed that Melbourne police reinforcements will go to the South Barwon Civic Centre, where organisers expect thousands of demonstrators.</p>
<p>Despite tickets being on sale for three weeks, there are still seats free for Miss Hanson's cocktail party, dinner and speech, with the speech just over half booked.</p>
<p>Tight security surrounds the arrival of the Independent Federal MP, and One Nation Party founder, in Melbourne this morning and security guards will be on-hand as she visits Geelong businesses.</p>
<p>One Nation officials will not reveal the time of her arrival and will not release details of her itinerary until late this morning.</p>
<p>But they say she will be taken directly from her flight this morning to a private room, to avoid the public airport foyer.</p>
<p>The organiser of tonight's torchlight vigil, Guenter Sahr, said he cannot guarantee peace, but he said all steps have been taken to try to avoid violence.</p>
<p>Geelong Mayor Gerry Smith and Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett have also called for a non-violent demonstration.</p>

<p>ANDERSON CONFIDENT OF MEAT MISSION SUCCESS</p>
<p>Australia's new meat inspection system has received strong support in the United States, according to Federal Primary Industries Minister John Anderson.</p>
<p>Meat is Australia's biggest export to the US, with the United States buying 20 per cent of Australia's beef exports, worth $400 million.</p>
<p>Mr Anderson is keen to convince its agricultural officials the new system will consolidate the safety and quality of Australian meat exports.</p>
<p>The system, known as &quot;Project two&quot;, puts the onus on meat companies, rather than government meat inspectors, to control quality.</p>
<p>Mr Anderson said agriculture officials in the US support Project two, but consumer groups have raised concerns.</p>
<p>Despite Mr Anderson's confidence, it will be a few weeks before the Australian Government knows if the new system is acceptable to the United States.</p>

<p>RUGBY LEAGUE: RAMS MAKE CHANGES</p>
<p>The Adelaide Rams have made four changes to the backs for tonight's Super League World Club Challenge match against Leeds in England.</p>
<p>Chris Quinn is out injured, while positional changes resulted in the other three moves.</p>
<p>The Rams had a convincing 26 point win over Leeds at the Adelaide Oval last month, but are likely to find the going much tougher in tonight's return match.</p>
<p>The Rams must win all three of their overseas games to retain their chance of topping pool B and playing in the finals.</p>
