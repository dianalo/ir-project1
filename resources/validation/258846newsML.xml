<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said agriculture was an important trade issue during Monday's meeting between top European Union officials and President Clinton.</p>
<p>He told USDA Radio that Clinton indicated the two sides had to resolve some pending agricultural disputes such as veterinary equivalency and biotech corn.</p>
<p>Glickman took part in the Washington summit, but EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler was not part of the visiting delegation.  </p>
<p>&quot;Both the European Union leadership and the president and I indicated that we thought we could get these resolved but we had to work together to keep them from becoming much more serious trade problems,&quot; Glickman said in the radio interview. &quot;So I leave that meeting rather encouraged.&quot;</p>
<p>However, Glickman said he was not sure the dispute with the EU over comparable veterinary standards for shipments of animal products could be resolved by a Jan. 1 deadline.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that they are demanding unreasonable things from us right now and we let them know that if the issues couldn't get resolved by Jan. 1 that we ought to give it additional time, because it would be very very bad to start the New Year with this kind of unresolved trade dispute,&quot; Glickman said.</p>
