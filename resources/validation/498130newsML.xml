<p>The consensus forecast was for a rise in industrial production of 0.2 percent month on month and 2.1 percent year on year. Manufacturing was expected to have risen by 0.3 percent mnth on month and 1.6 percent year on year.</p>
<p>The ONS said a majority of manufaucturing industries had shown increases in production in the three months to February compared with the previous three months.</p>
<p>The most notable rises were 2.4 percent in the output of the transport equipment industries and 2.0 percent in the basic metals and metal product industries.  </p>
<p>The most notable falls were 1.3 percent in the textiles, leather and clothing industries and 1.0 percent in the output of the rubber and plastics products industries.</p>
<p>The ONS said that demand for gas and electricity was lower in February than in January because of milder than average temperatures.</p>
<p>Oil and gas extraction fell by 2.4 percent in February from January, mainly due to lower gas production. Coal production was 3.0 percent lower in the three months to February from the previous three months and 11.9 percent lower than in the same period a year ago.  </p>
<p>In the three months to February, output of durable goods industries rose by 2.7 percent compared with the previous three months.</p>
<p>There were increases of 3.4 percent in the output of other durable goods and of 2.1 percent in the output of cars. Total output of durable goods in the latest three months was 5.2 percent higher than in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>In the non-durable goods industries, output rose 0.5 percent in the three months to February from the previous three months.  </p>
<p>A decrease of 2.1 percent in the output of clothing and footwear was offset by increases of 0.8 percent in the food, drink and tobacco industries and of 0.7 percent in the output of other non-durable goods.</p>
<p>Total output of non-durable goods in the latest three months was 1.1 percent higher than in the same period a year ago.</p>
