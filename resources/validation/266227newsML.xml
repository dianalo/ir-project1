<title>USA: Voice It, Voice Powered sign intent to merge.</title>
<headline>Voice It, Voice Powered sign intent to merge.</headline>
<dateline>SHERMAN OAKS, Calif 1996-12-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Voice It Worldwide Inc and Voice Powered Technology International Inc said they signed a letter of intent to merge through an exchange of stock.</p>
<p>Terms of the merger, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 1997, were not disclosed. The closing is subject to due diligence, financial performance, regulatory and shareholder approval.</p>
<p>Voice It designs and markets recorders that use computer chip technology to capture ideas, thoughts and reminders in portable hand-held products the size of a credit card.  </p>
<p>Voice Powered also designs and markets low cost portable voice recognition consumer electronics products.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the combination will do two things: synergrize our product lines and elimimate some redundancies in spending, which should have a direct effect on our bottom line,&quot; said Dennis Altbrandt, chief executive of Voice It.</p>
<p>Both companies employ about 30 people each. For the year ended December 31, 1995 Voice It had revenues of slightly over $16 million and a loss of $980,000. Voice Powered reported reported revenues of $22 million and a loss of $2.8 million for the same period.  </p>
<p>Albrandt said that the two companies agreed to merge because they both possess proprietary technology in similar areas.</p>
<p>Edward Krakauer, chief executive of Voice Powered Technology, said &quot;The process of completing the merger will take some time, but the plan is to have a profitable company.&quot;</p>
