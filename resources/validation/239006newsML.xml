<p>Indonesia's central bank cut its key discount rates by 50 basis points on Thursday, suggesting its overheated economy had begun to cool down, economists said.</p>
<p>Some treasurers said the move was also aimed at stabilising &quot;wild swings&quot; of interest rates in the interbank market.</p>
<p>&quot;It's appropriate because inflation has been falling. A lot of the domestic indicators are no longer threatening, I think the overheating situation is already sort of moderating,&quot; Vincent Low, economist at JP Morgan, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Year-on-year inflation in November was 6.71 percent against 8.37 percent in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The move followed recent cuts in deposit rates by state banks, allowing private banks to ease interest rates as a result of lower funding costs.</p>
<p>&quot;It's in line with what we have been saying, that interest rates can fall in Indonesia,&quot; Low said.</p>
<p>Bank Indonesia cut its key discount rate for short-term securities (SBPUs) by 50 basis points for all maturities, bringing one-week SBPUs to 15.25 percent, two-week to 15.50 percent, and one-, three-, six- and 12-month SBPUs to 16.0 percent.</p>
<p>SBPUs are paper purchased by the central bank to inject liquidity into the banking system.</p>
<p>Pardy Kendy, head of treasury at PT Bank Buana Indonesia, said the rate cut was also seen as a move to narrow the gap between SBPUs, which set the ceiling for interest rates, and SBIs, which set the bottom rate.</p>
<p>SBIs are securities issued by the central bank to absorb liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rates are sometimes a bit wild in the interbank market. This move may help reduce volatility,&quot; Kendy said.</p>
<p>One U.S. bank dealer said the impact was not immediately reflected in the dollar-rupiah rate but it did put pressure on forward premiums, which fell a few points.</p>
<p>Desimon, head of the fixed-income desk at brokerage PT Danareksa Sekuritas, said the move caused the benchmark PLN V/A bond yield to fall around 30 basis points to 16.14 percent.</p>
<p>The index for bank shares on the Jakarta Stock Exchange rose almost two percent following the cut. Stock analysts said lower funding costs and stable lending rates might generate higher earnings for banks.</p>
<p>Dealers said the SBPU cut had been anticipated following declines in rates of SBIs by 50 basis points since early November.</p>
<p>&quot;Operators seemed to have discounted the move, although the timing surprised the market,&quot; the U.S. bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Kendy said the impact on the money market was not immediately seen because interest rates were already traded at the lower end of the interest rate band.</p>
<p>&quot;To get a maximum impact on interest rates, the central bank might have to let SBI rates fall as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The signal would be much stronger if SBPUs and SBIs were down by the same extent,&quot; Kendy said, adding that SBIs were some 25 basis points lower than Wednesday.</p>
<p>Central Bank Governor Sudradjad Djiwandono said earlier that overheating pressures had eased following comprehensive measures taken by the government. Broad money M2 fell to 25.95 percent year-on-year in September from a high of 30.8 percent in May.</p>
<p>But the governor warned of overheating potential because money supply and credit growth were still higher than targets set in the 1996/97 budget ending next March.</p>
