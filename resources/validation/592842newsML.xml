<p>Cameroonians voted for a new parliament on Saturday in a largely peaceful poll marred only by complaints by opposition supporters in Yaounde and Douala, the two main cities, of problems with voter cards.</p>
<p>But as polling ended, there were no reports of significant violence, even from the English-speaking opposition stronghold of North-West Province, a flashpoint in largely French-speaking Cameroon.</p>
<p>&quot;I just pray and hope things move on well in a free and fair atmosphere,&quot; opposition Social Democratic Front (SDF) leader John Fru Ndi said when he voted in Bamenda, in North-West Province. Earlier, he predicted his party would win 100 of the new national assembly's 180 seats.</p>
<p>Polling appeared largely trouble-free in Bamenda, according to national radio reports. Political analysts said the interior ministry, which runs elections in Cameroon, appeared to have taken pains to prevent problems there.</p>
<p>In Yaounde, the main complaint was problems with voter cards. &quot;My friend had two cards where I was not even able to get one,&quot; said Ngassa Atangama, an opposition supporter.</p>
<p>In Douala, Cameroon's largest city and commercial capital, witnesses reported similar problems, but the main complaint there was the difficulty of getting to polling stations because of a ban on public transport.</p>
<p>A total of 45 parties fielded 1,800 candidates for the election.</p>
<p>President Paul Biya's Cameroon People's Democratic Rally (RDPC) counted on opposition divisions to help bring it victory.</p>
<p>&quot;We are targeting an absolute majority of at least 91 seats. Our popularity has improved. In the north, south and east we will obtain two-thirds of the seats,&quot; Azu'u Fonkam, coordinator of the party's election commission, told Reuters before polling.</p>
<p>&quot;The advantage is that, where we will be losing, the opposition will divide the seats,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Fru Ndi's Front boycotted the 1992 general election, but Fru Ndi received 35.9 percent of votes in the presidential election the same year to Biya's 39.9 percent. The opposition cried fraud.</p>
<p>North-West Province is under overnight curfew after attacks by suspected separatists on security forces in March.</p>
<p>The Front, however, is popular not only there but also among Cameroon's main ethnic Bamileke group and the urban poor. It polled well in municipal elections in Douala in January 1996.</p>
<p>Biya, who took over from independence president Ahmadou Ahidjo in 1982, faces a presidential election in October.</p>
<p>&quot;Five years ago we had difficulty getting five or six parties to participate in the legislative elections,&quot; Biya said when he voted in Yaounde. &quot;Today there are 45 parties. This shows the Cameroon people have committed themselves to the building of democracy.&quot;</p>
<p>In the 1992 election, Biya's party won 88 seats, and formed an alliance with the small Movement for the Defence of the Republic (MDR) to ensure a majority.</p>
<p>International observers described the 1992 poll as &quot;seriously flawed&quot; and &quot;very problematic&quot;.</p>
<p>London-based Amnesty International, highlighting fresh human rights violations in Cameroon, urged Biya's government to ensure that all citizens could vote without fear of arrest, detention or ill-treatment.</p>
<p>Election officials said first results may trickle out late on Saturday, but it may be days before a clear picture emerges.</p>
