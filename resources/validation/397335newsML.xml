<headline>Eurobourses close mixed, dollar slips.</headline>

<p>European shares closed mixed and generally weaker on Monday despite a rally on Wall Street, which opened down but picked up to trade around half a percentage point higher by the time European business ended.</p>
<p>On currency markets the dollar slipped to its lowest levels against the mark and the yen in almost two weeks amid worries about European monetary union and concern about Japanese fund repatriation ahead of the financial year-end.</p>
<p>Dealers said the U.S. currency was eyeing the downside below 1.67 marks and 122 yen in late European trading as short-term bearishness infected the market after the dollar's recent strong performance.</p>
<p>In London, Europe's biggest bourse, leading shares closed down but off the day's lows influenced in part by a batch of heavyweight stocks going ex-dividend, including Barclays and Lloyds TSB .</p>
<p>Investors were also concerned  that the strength of sterling -- at its highest level since it left the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992 -- would affect earnings as the corporate results season gets fully under way.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, German shares, which had earlier ended floor trading flat, fell in post bourse electronic trade and dealers said sentiment was weighed on by the softening of the dollar -- which is negative for German exports.</p>
<p>German shares were likely to remain rangebound in the near future, contaminated by uncertainty about the next likely direction of global markets and the outlook for the dollar, they said.</p>
<p>The 30-share IBIS DAX index of electronic trading closed down 23.16 points or around three-quarters of a percent.</p>
<p>In Paris, too, shares which had found some buying support and showed gains in early trading, turned down in the afternoon to trade flat or only slightly higher. The CAC-40 blue chip index eventually closed up 5.01 points at 2567.85.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was given some support by buying on the first account day although it was traded under the sway of softer domestic and German bonds and the retracement of the dollar.</p>
<p>One focus of the Paris bourse was resorts company Club Mediterranee . Its shares jumped to close around 21 percent up as investors welcomed the appointment of the head of Euro Disney to the ailing group.</p>
<p>Analysts said both equities and currency markets had trod water to a degree ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's semi-annual commentary on the U.S. economy to Senate and House committees on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>His utterances will, as usual, be scrutinized for clues to future U.S. credit policy.</p>
<p>One factor leading to weakness in the dollar was concern Japanese companies might sell more dollars than usual to repatriate funds ahead of fiscal year-end next month.</p>
<p>It was sparked by news overnight that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was planning to liquidate all its dollar-denominated deposits, currently around $700 million, and convert them into yen.</p>
<p>Against the mark, dollar weakness was exacerbated by talk of a delay to the start of EMU, fuelled by a poll in weekly news magazine Der Spiegel, released on Sunday. The poll showed 77 percent of Germans favour a delay until after the proposed starting date of 1999. EMU is regarded as being negative for the mark if it goes ahead and embraces weaker currencies.</p>
<p>The mark shrugged off benign producer price data and a downward revision of industry orders. Producer prices rose 0.3 percent in January and 0.7 percent from a year ago, against forecast increases of 0.3 and 1.1 percent. The Bundesbank revised down December industry orders to 96.3 from 96.7.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1645 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.6700 marks and 122.05 yen, compared with 1.6883 and 123.20 in late European trade on Friday.</p>
