<p>Pakistan's main fundamentalist Islamist Jamaat-i-Islami party launched its campaign on Saturday against February's general elections with a threat to lead a protest march to the capital Islamabad.</p>
<p>Party leader Qazi Hussain Ahmad, addressing a rally of thousands of people at a public park in the North West Frontier Province capital of Peshawar, said he would lead the march on Islamabad if the present caretaker government held the vote without punishing corrupt politicians.</p>
<p>&quot;Then everyone will march to Islamabad and President (Farooq) Leghari will see stars in daylight,&quot; he said. But he gave no date for the march.</p>
<p>In the past, authorities have banned most political marches in Islamabad for fear of any attack on foreign missions.</p>
<p>The Jamaat-i-Islami, which vows to bring about an Islamic revolution, announced last Sunday it would boycott the elections set for February 3, accusing the caretaker government of failing to stem corruption.</p>
<p>It also said it would hold protest rallies across the country but would not physically resist the elections for the 217-seat National Assembly (lower house of parliament) and four provincial assemblies.</p>
<p>Saturday's rally, attended by an estimated 7,000 people, was the first of the promised protests, at which Ahmad lambasted former prime ministers and rivals Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif for alleged corruption and said the caretaker government of Prime Minister Meraj Khalid had also joined their ranks by not carrying out a promised accountability.</p>
<p>&quot;Nawaz Sharif did not carry out Benazir Bhutto's accountability, Benazir did not conduct Nawaz Sharif's accountablity, and the caretaker government did not do it with with both of them because all three are thieves, robbers and looters,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will hold our own accountability,&quot; he said, referring to symbolic 'people's courts' the Jamaat plans to hold to try corrupt politicians in absentia.</p>
<p>Khalid's two-month-old government has come under increasing criticism for allegedly failing to bring any concrete evidence of corruption which President Leghari had cited for dissmissing of Bhutto's three-year-olld government on November 5.</p>
<p>The prime minister blames the delay on difficulties in collecting evidence.</p>
<p>The Jamaat has been in the forefront of a campaign against Bhutto, who was dismissed by Leghari on November 5 on disputed charges of corruption and misrule, but it has not done well in past elections.</p>
<p>Known for bitter rivalry Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party, it had won just three seats in the dissolved National Assembly at the last elections in October 1993, which Bhutto won. But, with a strong base in student politics, it has long shown more skill at mobilising its youthful followers to battle police.</p>
