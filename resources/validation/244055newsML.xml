<p>Advertisers' spending in major media will continue to rise in the year ahead, but the rate of increase will slow from the robust gains of 1996, media buying experts at the PaineWebber Media Conference predicted.</p>
<p>Media spending will climb 5.6 percent to $182.9 million in 1997 in the United States, predicted Interpublic Group of Cos Inc's McCann-Erickson ad agency's director of forecasting, Robert Coen.  That marks a pullback from the 7.6 percent rise expected for the year ending this month.  </p>
<p>John Perrits, chairman of Zenith Media Worldwide, also forecast a slowdown in media spending gains in the year, with North America's increase declining to 1.7 percent from 2.5 percent.  He saw it as a broad retrenchment from a worldwide media spending boom over the past three years.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to see a little slower growth because we have probably had our peak year in this cycle,&quot; said Perrits.</p>
<p>Media spending has climbed for the third year straight in 1996 on the back of strong consumer economies in most countries, with activity buoyed in the United States by the presidential election and Olympic ad promotions.  </p>
<p>Coen said that the main factor in the slower growth expected in the year ahead is the loss of big advertising events -- the elections and the Olympics -- which accounted for more than $1 billion in ad spending.  But he said the expansion in media spending will continue for the foreseeable future, owing to a healthy consumer economy and large marketing outlays.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumers are employed now and confident about their jobs,&quot; he said, citing 10 million new jobs since 1992, when the ad business was attempting to hurl off a major recession.  </p>
<p>Media experts see ad spending linked to the consumer economy more than to corporate profitability.</p>
<p>Coen disagreed with Zenith's Perrits about the likelihood that the expansion has begun to see its limits, saying that &quot;this recovery has some time to go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We've had three years of good growth and there's a lot of concern that that's it,&quot; said Coen.  &quot;I don't think it is.  I don't think the current recovery is going to end in three years.&quot;</p>
<p>Coen cited statistics showing that the last expansion in media spending lasted for 12 years, from 1975 to 1987.  </p>
<p>Zenith's Perrits agreed that the expansion would continue until 1999, but he said future gains are likely to be less significant than those of the past few years.</p>
<p>In the global market, Perrits saw European media continuing to expand but he expected austerity ahead of currency union to begin cutting into growth.  The Asia Pacific region, too, was seen gaining in the year ahead, helped by a recovery in the Japanese consumer market and the emergence of consumer markets in China and other developing nations.</p>
