<p>Spanish digital pay-television groups CanalSatellite and Telefonica de Espana-led Via Digital will meet on Thursday under the auspices of the European Commission to try to solve a damaging conflict over TV decoders.</p>
<p>Spain has beem embroiled in a political fight over the launch of digital TV which pits powerful French pay-television operator Canal Plus and its local ally Prisa against telecoms firm Telefonica and state television RTVE supported by the centre-right government of Jose Maria Aznar.</p>
<p>Canal Plus and Prisa, which controls the influential left-wing newspaper El Pais, are linked in a joint venture called Sogecable.</p>
<p>Sogecable's chief executive Juan Luis Cebrian and the director of CanalSatellite Jaume Ferrus will attend the meeting on Thursday in Brussels, a Sogecable spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman for European Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann said high-ranking company officials would be present, but was enable to give any names. Bangemann may also attend, he said.</p>
<p>At issue is the use of decoders to unscramble encrypted TV channels and in particular whether there should be only one type of decoder to give consumers a greater choice of programmes at the best price.</p>
<p>The Spanish government took the view that this should be the case and overruled the simulcrypt decoder system owned by Sogecable. Instead it approved a multicrypt system which will be used by Via Digital when it launches its own platform in September.</p>
<p>Prisa has complained to the Commission. CanalSatellite began operations in January using the Sogecable decoder.</p>
<p>European commissioner Mario Monti, who must ensure there are no obstacles to trade in the EU's single market for goods and services, has warned that Spanish legislation requiring decoders to be standardised is a violation of the free movement principle. This is because Sogecable's decoder is already in use in France.</p>
<p>But he agreed to give the industry a last chance to agree before starting infringement proceedings against Spain.</p>
<p>&quot;We have agreed with (Spanish Post and Telecommunications Minister Rafael) Arias Salgado to hold discussions before we open formal infraction proceedings,&quot; Monti told reporters last week.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the Commission has intervened in national decoder battles. Almost a year ago, Bangemann organised a meeting in Paris to solve a similar fight in Germany.</p>
<p>EU sources said on Tuesday that the Commission may propose legally binding rules if the Spanish operators fail to come to an agreement to avoid future problems.</p>
