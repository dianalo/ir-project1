<p>Britain's Health Education Authority launched an attack on alcopops on Friday, saying their research clearly showed that the cola and fruit flavoured alcoholic drinks specifically appealed to under age drinkers.</p>
<p>&quot;Brewers can't justify claims that their marketing doesn't appeal to teenagers,&quot; said Dr Lynne Friedli, HEA alcohol campaign manager in a statement.</p>
<p>The research concluded from 2,433 interviews throughout England in March and April 1996 that 84 percent of 15-16 year old boys and 87 percent of girls who drink alcohol at least once a month have tried alcopops.</p>
<p>It also showed that after beers and ciders, alcopops were the most popular alcoholic drink among 13-16 year olds and 63 percent of 15-16 year olds wrongly believed that alcopops were less strong than beer or lager.</p>
<p>&quot;These products have a higher alcohol content than many youngsters realise, which could have worrying health consequences as well as an increased rise of short term harm from accidents,&quot; said Friedli.</p>
<p>A total 39 percent of 11-18 year olds and 51 percent of 15-16 year olds described alcopops as &quot;something to drink with our friends at parties.&quot;</p>
<p>For 13-16 year olds alcopops were said to be the easiest alcoholic drink to obtain, said the research.</p>
<p>The sweet taste of alcopops such as alcoholic lemonade had made them a firm favourite with under-age drinkers, the authority said.</p>
<p>But the drink industry's Portman Group said the HEA report showed beer, lager, stout and cider were more popular with teens than alcopops and 67 per cent of those who had heard of them had not drank them.</p>
<p>&quot;Awareness of alcopops by teenagers does not necessarily mean they drink them,&quot; said Andrew Chevis, head of public affairs at The Portman Group.</p>
<p>&quot;We find it worrying that the HEA conclusions seem to ignore the clear finding of their own reaseach. They call for more research into alcopops alone despite alcopops being nobody's favourite,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Hoopers Hooch, Britain's top selling alcopop brewed by Bass Plc, currently sells about three million bottles a week. Two Dogs, owned by cider-maker Merrydown is also a popular brand.</p>
