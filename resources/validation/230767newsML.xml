<p>Lower than expected tax revenue and increasing costs linked to debt are putting pressure on Slovakia's budgetary targets, the finance ministry said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Trends in fulfilling the state budget in the (first) nine-month period of 1996 indicate a tension in budgetary relations,&quot; the ministry said in its quarterly budget report, which will be presented to parliament on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the government raised its forecasts of both state spending and revenue from the original budget passed by parliament, while keeping the deficit unchanged. But there are signs that a budget crunch is looming in the last quarter.</p>
<p>Data released last month showed the deficit almost doubled in September, rising to 13.4 billion crowns for the January-September period from 7.9 billion in January-August.</p>
<p>The deficit for the full year is projected at 26.95 billion crowns. But last week the cabinet moved to stop this figure being overshot, freezing expenditure for all but the Social Affairs and Interior Ministries.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry pinpointed the difficulties. &quot;Problems with fulfilling revenue according to the state budget from value added tax and consumer taxes are persisting,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Higher expenditure especially in the section of the budget concerning state debt is expected in the last quarter of 1996, while simultaneously there is an obvious tendency to draw on budget funds regardless of revenue achieved,&quot; the report added. It did not explain why debt-related spending was accelerating.</p>
<p>According to the report, expenditure totalled 133.1 billion crowns in the nine months to September or 69.2 percent of the revised full-year target of 192.4 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Total revenue in the first nine months at 119.6 billion crowns was actually slightly higher as a percentage of the full-year target at 72.3 percent.</p>
<p>But the report said this was still lower than expected. &quot;Expectations for tax revenue have not been met, accounting for 70.9 percent (of the full-year plan), while non-tax revenue volume has already surpassed the full-year plan,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Current expenditure accounted for 78.5 percent of the overall full-year target in the nine months to September while capital expenditure was 67.2 percent and state-debt expenditure 72.2 percent.</p>
<p>Economists say that tax evasion remains a major problem in Slovakia.</p>
<p>Amid signs that the government's debt financing needs are growing, yields on treasury bills have risen sharply in the past few months. The average yield on three-week bills hit 10.41 percent on November 27, up from 7.849 on July 3.</p>
<p>Short-term interbank money market rates have also risen in recent months due to central bank measures aimed at tightening the money supply introduced in mid-July.</p>
