<p>Syria said on Wednesday there was nothing new in a call by Israeli Foreign Miniser David Levy to resume talks on the basis of U.N. resolutions calling for the exchange of Arab land for peace.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara said Israel should express readiness to resume the talks from the point at which they stopped with the previous Labour-led government and to approve all commitments made by that government.</p>
<p>&quot;The important thing here is not to give a statement saying they are ready to resume talks within the framework of Madrid but to say they are ready to resume the talks from the point at which they ended and to approve the commitments which were achieved during the recent period,&quot; Shara told reporters.</p>
<p>Syria has said Israel's previous government approved during five years of sporadic talks that were suspended 10 months ago the principle of full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967.</p>
<p>The previous government had said it was ready for partial pullback from the Golan in return for full peace with Syria but did not make any public statement accepting total withdrawal.</p>
<p>Shara did not refer to remarks by Levy earlier on Wednesday in which he said he was exchanging messages with him and that he was ready to meet his Syrian counterpart any time to discuss reviving peace talks.</p>
<p>But Syrian officials had in the past refused to hold any high-level contacts with Israel until the achievement of a breakthrough in the negotiations.</p>
<p>Syria had strongly condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to exchange the occupied Arab lands for peace and said it would not resume talks with his Likud-led government until he accepted total withdrawal.</p>
<p>Shara said that although a former Likud government approved the 1991 Madrid conference which was based on the land-for-peace principle it made its own interpretation that contradicted the principle.</p>
<p>&quot;We remember the sessions which were held after Madrid in Washington which were full of clashes because Israel refused to talk about withdrawal and claimed that it has its own interpretations of the land-for-peace principle and U.N. resolutions 242 and 338,&quot; Shara said.</p>
<p>Shara commented on press reports that said outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher had sent a message to Netanyahu relieving him of commitments made by his predecessors, in which they accepted full withdrawal from the Golan.</p>
<p>&quot;I can say that we were not informed of this issue at all... The U.S. which keeps Israel's committment has no right to do anything with it,&quot; Shara said.</p>
<p>&quot;If such a thing happens it will gravely harm the U.S. credibility in the region and the whole world,&quot; he added.</p>
