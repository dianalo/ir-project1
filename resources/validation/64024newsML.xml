<title>MEXICO: Mexico Cetes rate closes up on peso, long bond.</title>
<headline>Mexico Cetes rate closes up on peso, long bond.</headline>

<p>Mexico's overnight Cetes rate closed 100 basis points up at 22.50 percent on Thursday, due to weakness in the peso and gains in U.S. long-bond rates, traders said.</p>
<p>Closing rates were lower than sessions highs, however.</p>
<p>&quot;(Cetes) rates were up to 23.45 percent, but the closing rate was not representative and we'll be back at 23 percent tomorrow,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Rates rose early due to weakness in the peso and higher rates in the U.S. bond market, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The peso-dollar rate and long bond were driving rates up from early on,&quot; a trader said. &quot;We'll be very dependent on the long bond until September 24, when the Fed decides interest rate policy,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso earlier closed 3.5 centavos weaker at 7.5260/7.53 per dollar.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile closed 60 basis points up at 24.60 percent.</p>
<p>Liquidity shortages for the session, due to 1.800 billion pesos in credit maturities and an overplacement from the primary auction, were offset by government spending and 1.1 billion pesos in surplus liquidity carried over from Wednesday.</p>
<p>Because there was plenty of liquidity, Banco de Mexico earlier injected a relatively low amount of 411 million pesos by auctioning one overnight credit, which it assigned at a rate of 24.56 percent.</p>
<p>Credit maturities for Friday total 411 million pesos, but traders estimated that liquidity shortages could be substantial increase due to corporate tax bills totalling 7.0 billion pesos.</p>
