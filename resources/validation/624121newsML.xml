<headline>BATTLE ON TV SOCCER TESTS SPAIN'S GOVERNMENT.</headline>

<p>Spain's year-old government managed to pass a controversial law on Thursday to regulate soccer viewing rights, but it lost the support of parliamentary allies in the bitter battle.</p>
<p>The minority Popular Party (PP) government had to scramble to find acceptable wording to win enough backing in Congress for the law which was passed with the votes of the Basque Nationalist Party, a smaller parliamentary ally, and the left-wing opposition United Left.</p>
<p>Deputies from the main opposition Socialist Party, the Mixed Group of small parties, and the government's supposed allies, the Catalan Convergence and Unity coalition, voted against the measure because it was seen as retroactive and interventionist.</p>
<p>On the surface, the debate was whether important soccer matches could be aired on pay-TV as planned by media joint venture Audiovisual Sport or general public viewing on open channels should be guaranteed as the government wanted.</p>
<p>But brewing underneath was a complicated intrigue pitting one media group backed by the government against a rival group tied to the Socialists, who lost power in a 1996 election after almost 14 years in government.</p>
<p>The Convergence and Unity coalition switched sides because they have an interest in Audiovisual Sport, which is 15 percent owned by Catalan television channel TV3. They want its contracts to air soccer matches honoured.</p>
<p>&quot;Lamentably, we are distancing ourselves from the PP,&quot; Catalan coalition spokesman Josep Lopez de Lerma told journalists on Thursday. &quot;I had hoped that there was room for negotiation, even at the last minute, but the truth is the positions are very entrenched.&quot;</p>
<p>The battle started last year when media mogul Antonio Asensio, whose Antena 3 television channel has 40 percent of Audiovisual Sport, switched his allegiance and his soccer rights to a digital television platform competing with one supported by the government.</p>
<p>The debate degenerated into acrimonious name-calling when former Socialist prime minister Felipe Gonzalez accused the government's chief spokesman of having threatened Asensio with jail if he left the government-backed platform.</p>
<p>Both Asensio and the spokesman Miguel Angel Rodriguez appeared in Congress to defend their versions of the allegedly threatening phone call that Rodriguez made to Asensio on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>Rodriguez denied he made any threats and said it was all a plot cooked up by the Socialists.</p>
<p>The Catalans said they too were worried about the alleged pressure Rodriguez had used against a news executive and that their backing was far from guaranteed.</p>
<p>On February 21, the government proposed the law regulating soccer rights, saying that they had been bought and were being distributed in a monopolistic way.</p>
<p>After a lot of behind-the-scenes haggling, the Popular Party found an unusual supporter in the communist-led United Left, which objected to the way commerical interests controlled the television viewing of soccer matches.</p>
<p>The Socialists said they would appeal the law to the Constitutional Court on grounds it violates rights.</p>
<p>&quot;We're facing a really strange phenomenon that worries me because it affects the rules of the game and freedoms,&quot; Gonzalez said afterward.</p>
