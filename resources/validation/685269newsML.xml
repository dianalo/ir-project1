<p>Internazionale said on Wednesday they were close to signing Nigerian Taribo West, an Olympic team mate of Nwankwo Kanu who was signed last season but has yet to play due to a heart problem.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing definitive signed yet,&quot; an Inter spokesman said. &quot;Medical tests have not yet been completed.&quot;</p>
<p>Inter signed Olympic gold medallist Kanu from Ajax in 1996 before the Atlanta Olympics and later discovered that he had a defective heart valve which was potentially life-threatening and needed surgery.</p>
<p>The player is recovering and has been cleared by American doctors to play competitive soccer again but Inter have remained cautious about his chances of making a comeback.</p>
<p>West, a 23-year-old defender, started out as a professional in France with his current club Auxerre.</p>
<p>The Gazzetta dello Sport said West had agreed a contract with Inter until the year 2001. It reported that medical tests were scheduled for Monday and again on Tuesday but were postponed because the player felt unwell.</p>
