<p>While Hong Kong's blue-chip stocks pursue an expected consolidation, investors are likely to find initial public offerings (IPO) a more exciting alternative in coming weeks, analysts said.</p>
<p>Since reaching an all-time high of 14,004.93 on January 16, the Hang Seng blue-chip index has shed 560 points, closing at 13,444.85 on Friday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, new listings have put on a strong performance and offered quick profits, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can easily make money from buying blue chips, no one will look into IPOs. And as the market is quiet, more people will look at IPOs,&quot; said Percy Au-young, director of research at DBS Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Many new listings have performed very well and most of them have traded above their issue price. They were spectacular after their listings,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Investors have been reducing heavily overweight positions in Hong Kong over recent weeks, which has contributed to the market's decline, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Many fund managers are still overweighted Hong Kong,&quot; said Eugene Law, director at Lippo Securities Ltd. &quot;They will pay attention to IPOs to fill up the gap in a quiet market and for short-term investments.&quot;</p>
<p>Rumours concerning the health of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping also had contributed to a slide in share prices though his death last Wednesday removed the uncertainty that had been hurting the market, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is healthier after the recent correction and the removal of the element of uncertainty,&quot; said Law.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall investment sentiment has improved. The IPO market, the highly visible part of the market, is likely to attract many investors' attention.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said there was a good mix of offerings in the pipeline. The 250 million share IPO of Shum Yip Investment Ltd, a company backed by the Shenzhen municipal government, was considered the most attractive.</p>
<p>Shum Yip's main business is property investment and development but it has diversified into transportation.</p>
<p>The subscription period for the offering, priced at HK$1.85 per share, opened last Friday and will run until February 26.</p>
<p>Dealing in the stock is due to begin on March 7.</p>
<p>&quot;I would regard Shum Yip as a mini red-chip play or mini conglomerate, and possible future asset injections will likely boost the IPO response,&quot; said Tony Yung, research manager at Tai Fook Securities.</p>
<p>Capacitors and resistors-maker Man Yue International Holdings Ltd is offering 55 million new shares at HK$1.08 each.</p>
<p>The subscription period for its IPO closed last Friday and trading in the shares is to begin on March 5.</p>
<p>&quot;The response to the two IPOs will give an indication to the market of the impact of recent fluctuations,&quot; said Patrick Cheng, corporate finance director at HSBC Investment Banking.</p>
<p>Boto Co Ltd, which makes artificial Christmas trees, said last week it would issue 125.4 million new shares at HK$1.28 each. The IPO is due to run from February 24-27, with dealing in the shares due to begin on March 10.</p>
<p>Tai Shan Properties Ltd, a spinoff of Great Eagle Holdings Ltd, is expected to issue 225 million new shares at HK$10.60 to HK$11.45 per share, market sources said.</p>
<p>Its IPO is expected to run from March 4-7, with dealing in the shares expected to begin on March 14, they added.</p>
<p>Market sources also said leather garments maker Peking Apparel International Group Ltd was due to list in March.</p>
