<p>Insurer Prudential Corp. stepped in Tuesday to defend the independence of British electricity company Northern Electric Plc against a hostile U.S. takeover, paying 4.6 million pounds ($7.7 million) to buy up over 709,000 of its shares.</p>
<p>Northern confirmed the Prudential purchases at 6.50 pounds per share following market rumours that the insurer had been buying Northern shares in an effort to thwart a bid for Northern by CE Electric, which is 70 percent owned by Omaha-based CalEnergy Co. Inc..</p>
<p>Northern made a last-minute attempt Tuesday to rally shareholders back to its side to fight off CE's 782 million pound ($1.31 billion) bid after Britain's Takeover Panel extended the closing date for the offer to 1 p.m. GMT (8 a.m. EST) on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Northern's fate depended on winning back some 200,000 shares conditionally pledged to CE Electric in the bitterly contested battle.</p>
<p>Market sources said the Prudential buying was a boost to Northern, but did not necessarily mean CE would lose the fight as other shareholders may have backed the U.S. firm.</p>
<p>Northern urged shareholders to withdraw acceptances of CE's offer by the deadline. &quot;It's now up to the market,&quot; Northern said in a statement.</p>
<p>Northern said that in the event of the CE bid lapsing, it was willing to talk with CE or another party &quot;with a view to reaching agreement on an improved offer for Northern.&quot;</p>
<p>By agreeing to effectively &quot;collapse&quot; a rule that says a bidder cannot come back and bid for the same company within a 12-month period, Northern was opening the way for shareholders to withdraw their acceptances and re-open the debate about the value of the company, a Northern spokesman said.</p>
<p>Late Monday, Britain's Takeover Panel quashed an appeal by Northern against the extension of the deadline from 1300 GMT last Friday.</p>
<p>CE said Monday it owned or had acceptances for 50.13 percent of Northern's shares -- enough to win control of the company -- compared with the only 49.77 percent it had at the end of the previous deadline on Friday.</p>
<p>CE declined to give an update on the level of acceptances it had ahead of the deadline. &quot;We are extremely optimistic,&quot; a spokesman said.</p>
<p>In rejecting Northern's appeal, the Takeover Panel referred to a discretionary payment of 250,000 pounds ($359,000) to one of the firm's advisers, Barclays Plc's BZW, that was not declared until Friday.</p>
<p>CE had raised concerns about the purchase of Northern shares last week by BZW and merchant bank Schroders.</p>
<p>&quot;What is clear is that BZW had failed to inform the panel of the full facts and that during the last days of the offer it purchased shares in Northern whilst these facts remained undisclosed,&quot; the panel said.</p>
<p>&quot;In all the circumstances, the panel therefore feels that justice requires it to allow CE a final opportunity to obtain sufficient acceptances to declare its offer unconditional,&quot; the watchdog added.</p>
<p>BZW said it had done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;BZW has at all times acted in good faith and has risked its own capital in support of Northern's defence. Our fee arrangement was in no way contingent upon the purchase of Northern shares and the panel has permitted this purchase to stand,&quot; a spokesman for the firm told Reuters.</p>
<p>It was not the first time such uncertainty has surrounded Northern's future since it was privatised along with its 11 regional electricity company peers in 1990.</p>
<p>In 1994 it was the first of the cash-rich RECs to face a takeover. Partly with the help of an extraordinary 560 million pound ($800 million) defence package, it successfully fought off a bid from conglomerate Trafalgar House, now owned by Norway's Kvaerner.</p>
<p>If CE's bid goes through, only two of the original RECs will remain independent, Yorkshire Electricity and Southern Electric.</p>
