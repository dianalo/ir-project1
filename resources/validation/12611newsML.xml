<p>Taranaki pulled off the biggest surprise of the New Zealand rugby season by beating national champions Auckland 42-39 to lift the Ranfurly Shield at Auckland's Eden Park on Saturday.</p>
<p>The central North Island's Taranaki side, newly promoted to the first division and without their inspirational captain and All Black prop Mark Allen, had not won a match in seven outings this season.</p>
<p>But they took advantage of an Auckland side missing several key players who are in South Africa with the All Blacks to claim their first shield since 1963.</p>
<p>In a thrilling match which saw the lead change several times, both teams scored five tries. For Taranaki, who led 18-15 at halftime, inside centre Dean Magon touched down three times in the second half, with flyhalf Jamie Cameron and fullback Daryl Lilley kicking 17 points between them.</p>
<p>A couple of tries early in the second half appeared to give Auckland the advantage and they led 39-32 going into the closing minutes. But a Lilley penalty and Magon's splendid final converted try put Taranaki back in front for the final time five minutes from the finish.</p>
<p>Taranaki's first defence of the shield will be next Saturday against another of the strongest New Zealand provincial teams, North Harbour, in New Plymouth.</p>
