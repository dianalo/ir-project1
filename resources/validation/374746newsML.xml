<p>Australian Lucas Parsons equalled the course record with a nine under par 64 to snatch the spotlight from Tiger Woods in the first round of the Australian Masters on Thursday.</p>
<p>Woods, who won the Bangkok Classic in Thailand on Sunday, his fourth tournament victory since turning professional last August, plundered the long holes at Huntingdale to finish five under par at 68 for a share of fifth place.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old heavy-hitting American birdied all four par-fives on the par-73 course to the delight of a large gallery, even though he only used his driver once.</p>
<p>&quot;I grinded my way around there and came in with a good score. Off the tee, it was probably one of my better ball striking rounds in a while,&quot; Woods told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;It was just the mental grind of playing a golf course that requires accuracy and so much precision off the tee. You don't really have a chance to relax.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't played my best golf today. I just made one birdie besides the par fives and that's not saying a whole lot.&quot;</p>
<p>Australian Peter O'Malley held second place on the leader board with a 65, eight under par.</p>
<p>Parsons fired six birdies on the front nine before holding his second shot at the par four 13th for an eagle two in the highlight of his round.</p>
<p>His approach shot landed on the green and bounced two metres beyond the flag but then spun back into the hole.</p>
<p>The eagle helped Parsons to a share of the course record with compatriot Mike Clayton and German Bernhard Langer.</p>
<p>&quot;My game has been getting better (over recent months). This is a course I know and I can play well here,&quot; said Parsons.</p>
<p>&quot;I got off to a good start today and it just kept happening. I just went with the flow,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>American Larry Mize, a former U.S. Masters champion, finished on five under alongside Woods, while defending champion Craig Parry of Australia struggled to a level par 73.</p>
