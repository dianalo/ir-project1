<p>Following are some of the main factors likely to affect Philippine stocks on Tuesday:</p>
<p>* On Tuesday, the Dow Jones rose by 9.25 points to 5,882.17. PLDT's ADR fell by $ 1 1/2 to $62 1/2.</p>
<p>* The peso closed at 26.236 to a U.S.dollar from 26.252.</p>
<p>* The Philippine Stock Exchange index closed at 3,169.78, down 53.93.</p>
<p>* The Philippine interbank call loan rate rose to 11.96875 percent from 11.09375.  </p>
<p>* Sun Hung Kai Securities in its outlook for the day said with the breakthrough of the Philippine Stock Exchange Index (Phisix) at 3,200, this level will become the immediate resistance instead. The next support of the market will be at around the 50-day moving average 3,150 at which the index tested in early September. Investors would also start to adjust their portfolio to prepare for the upcoming release of September inflation data.</p>
<p>* Angping Securities recommended a long-term buy on PLDT, citing the firm's installation of E1 lines which is essential for interconnection. It also mentioned PLDT's laying of a second fibre optic cable link to Guam.</p>
<p>Angping said the installation of the E1s will enable PLDT and other operators to capture more calls and provide better services. The cable link will ensure the company's value-added revenues in the coming years. PLDT was trading at 18.4 times and 14.4 times on 1996 and 1997 earnings respectively, it said.</p>
<p>* BPI Securities said Monday's sharp drop in the Philippine Stock Exchange index had caused confusion in the market. It said: &quot;We believe the drop in the index is a technical consolidation in the market. Economic and corporate fundamentals are still strong as we go into 1997. We suggest that investors adopt a wait and see attitude for the next couple of days. We continue to recommend to buy on weakness and to buy stocks which will give good upside earnings growth in 1997.&quot;</p>
