<p>Any hopes for a quick turnaround for technology giant Motorola Inc were dampened on Tuesday, analysts said, as the company projected charges from cost-cutting and little relief from price competition.</p>
<p>&quot;The turnaround which people were expecting is probably going to be late to happen,&quot; said Rakesh Sood, an analyst for Hambrecht &amp; Quist.</p>
<p>Sood and other analysts have cut fourth quarter and 1997 earnings estimates, and PaineWebber, for example, downgraded its rating on the stock to attractive from buy.  </p>
<p>On Monday Motorola reported earnings of $0.34 a share versus $0.81 last year.  Revenues were $6.5 billion, down from $6.9 billion.  This was the second consecutive quarter for which the company had reported lower sales after having consistently reported growth since 1985.</p>
<p>Shares of Motorola traded 3/8 lower at 48-7/8.</p>
<p>The company continues to cite weakness in a semiconductor industry swamped with overcapacity and stiff pricing competition in other businesses, including cellular telephone handsets, modems and pagers.  </p>
<p>Motorola said it will take charges of &quot;several tens of millions of dollars&quot; in the fourth quarter related to cost-cutting measures in its semiconductor and other groups.</p>
<p>&quot;I was surprised by how poorly their semiconductor business did this quarter.&quot; said Lawrence Borgman, an analyst for Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross.</p>
<p>Ater Motorola's semiconductor group essentially broke even in the third quarter, the company told analysts to expect a few more quarters of declines in sales and orders in the overall industry.  </p>
<p>&quot;Pricing remains competitive in all our major businesses and we expect this to continue,&quot; Ed Gams, director of investor relations, said in a conference call.</p>
<p>Gams said the company expects semiconductor industry-wide revenues to grow by less than 10 percent in 1997.  At an analysts' meeting in July, the company had said it expected an industry growth rate of 12 to 13 percent.  Motorola pegged revenues for the worldwide semiconductor industry last year at $145.9 billion.  </p>
<p>In addition, Motorola said it expects the Iridium LLC global telecommunications project to post losses widening by &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars&quot; in 1997 versus 1996. Motorola has a 25 percent stake in the Iridium LLC consortium.</p>
<p>&quot;The company gave two reasons to take the numbers down,&quot; said one analyst, who asked not to be named, referring to the Iridium losses and the weaker semiconductor projections.</p>
<p>Despite the words of caution, most analysts seem willing to stick with Motorola as a long-term investment.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our conclusion is that Motorola isn't any less of a great company; it's just a technology company,&quot; said Doug Christopher, an analyst with Crowell Weedon.  &quot;They're a well- run company, their products are first rate, but a technology company will experience this kind of volatiliy.  You have to be patient in the near term.&quot;</p>
<p>One analyst, for example, pointed out that the company's manufacturing margin in the cellular handset division was up versus the third quarter last year -- the only division to post an increase, despite the pricing pressure worldwide.</p>
<p>&quot;That's very impressive, and it's very Motorola-like,&quot; said the analyst who asked not to be named.  &quot;These guys are manufacturing gods.&quot;</p>
