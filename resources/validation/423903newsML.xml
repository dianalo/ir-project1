<p>Australia and New Zealand food group Goodman Fielder Ltd said on Friday its sales performance was patchy in the first half of the 1996/97 year to June 30, with the rise in net profit due to better financial management.</p>
<p>&quot;Sales performance was mixed with some businesses increasing sales and others offsetting sluggish demand with improved margin management,&quot; the company said, also citing a flat profit result before tax and interest of A$121.5 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite these factors, net profit increased as a result of improved cash management and lower debt and interest payments, and lower abnormals,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>Sales in the latest period fell by one percent to A$2.06 billion, while net profit after abnormals rose to A$55.8 million from A$45.9 million.</p>
<p>The company said key factors in the first half included high global wheat costs which added A$24 million to input costs, costs reductions in all divisions, higher profits for the Meadow Lea margarine unit, a profit rebound for the Steggles chicken unit, and strong performances by operations in Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific.  </p>
<p>Sales by Milling and Baking, the company's largest division, rose 1.4 percent to A$471.4 million while earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) fell 28.1 percent to A$30.4 million due to higher wheat prices.</p>
<p>Steggles achieved a rise in EBIT to A$9.8 million from A$3.2 million a year ago and sales rose by 1.5 percent to A$252 million. &quot;A severe industry wide stock shortage fuelled price rises and Steggles benefited from changes in the sales mix from frozen to fresh chicken with higher margins.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Edible Oils and Foodservice unit increased EBIT by 22.6 percent to A$27.1 million but sales fell 2.5 percent to A$279.5 million.</p>
<p>The Cereals and Snacks unit increased EBIT by 30.1 percent to A$21.6 million and sales fell 1.5 percent to A$238.4 million.</p>
<p>EBIT by the Ingredients division was flat at A$16.4 million from A$16.3 million a year ago and sales fell 1.7 percent to A$161.5 million.</p>
<p>The International division, consisting of South Pacific and Asian operations, increased EBIT to A$8.4 million from A$5.1 million on a 3.0 percent sales rise to A$137.7 million.  </p>
