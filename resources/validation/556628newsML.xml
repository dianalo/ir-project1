<title>USA: U.S. debt futures rally on data, turn very choppy.</title>
<headline>U.S. debt futures rally on data, turn very choppy.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. debt futures rallied on a weaker-than-expected jobs rise in April, with trading choppy and volume brisk early.</p>
<p>April jobs rose 142,000 against a forecast for a 211,000 gain, and March was revised downward to 139,000 from 175,000.</p>
<p>The jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent from 5.2 percent.</p>
<p>June Treasury bonds and September Euros rallied near two-month highs on the data then sliced their gains before drifting back toward the top of the range again.</p>
<p>Traders called action extremely choppy. T-bond and Eurodollar futures were trading in fast markets.  </p>
<p>&quot;Look at those numbers, each component is so extreme,&quot; one T-bond trader said. &quot;Everything just completely whipsaws us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Average hourly earnings slipped to $12.14 from $12.15 and the average workweek slipped to 34.6 hours from 34.9 in March. Overtime hours rose to 5.0 from 4.9 and manufacturing hours inched up to 42.2 from 42.1.</p>
<p>September Euros popped above resistance at 93.90 and broke above the 200-day moving average at 93.93.</p>
<p>But Euros soon erased their gains and turned lower.  </p>
<p>&quot;They ran up really good, but we had a big sell off as all the locals turned sellers,&quot; a Eurodollar trader said. September made an attempt to recover before slipping into negative territory.</p>
<p>By 0807 CDT/1307 GMT, debt futures turned mixed.</p>
<p>&quot;We had buying coming off the lower-than-expected payrolls numbers and the hourly earnings, but I think the market has done so much this week that I think you're seeing some profit-taking,&quot; said John Kadich, floor analyst with Dean Witter.</p>
<p>Fast market status was lifted from the markets.  </p>
<p>He said traders were beginning to focus on the much weaker-than-expected jobless rate of 4.9 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The question now is when does low unemployment hit the market,&quot; Kadich said.</p>
<p>As debt futures headed back near Thursday's closing levels, activity tapered off some, with action still choppy, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're kind of mulling through the numbers,&quot; said Kurt Fraim, futures analyst with Aubrey G. Lanston. He pegged resistance now in June T-bonds at 109-28/32 and in 10-year notes at 107-16/32, two levels breached on the rally.  </p>
<p>He pegged the next significant support in June 10-year notes at 105-16/32 and at 108-12/32 in T-bonds.</p>
<p>At 0826 CDT/1326 GMT, June T-bonds were up 2/32 to 109-23/32, 10-year notes rose 1/32 to 107-6/32, September T-bills were flat at 94.460, September Eurodollars were down 0.010 at 93.875 and December Eurodollars were 0.005 higher at 93.660.
