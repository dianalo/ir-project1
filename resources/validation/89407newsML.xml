<p>Italian Treasury and Budget Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi on Tuesday rebuffed French President Jacques Chirac for his comments that Italy might not be ready for European monetary union, saying no one had the right to play the role of examiner.</p>
<p>&quot;Italy is committed to fulfilling the (criteria of the Maastricht) treaty which binds us to the same conditions valid for the other countries,&quot; Ciampi told reporters at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be examinations and evaluations for everybody, under the rules (which are) valid for all. No one can pretend to have an examiner's licence, and much less that of unique examiner,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chirac fuelled a diplomatic row with Rome by casting doubt on whether Italy would meet Maastricht treaty criteria, which require budget deficits to be reduced to three percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>He attempted to calm the dispute on Tuesday by saying he strongly hoped Italy would be in the first wave of countries to join a single European currency to be launched in 1999.</p>
<p>Italy last week passed a tough 1997 budget, which includes a special EU tax to reduce the deficit, designed to make sure it is ready for Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p>Its budget was praised by European Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy, who said here on Sunday there could be an increasing number of countries joining EMU at the start.</p>
<p>But some economists have suggested membership of monetary union by Italy, along with Spain and Portugal, might weaken the new euro at its launch, forcing higher interest rates on the fledging monetary union as it seeks to establish its credibility in financial markets.</p>
<p>They believe Germany, and possibly France, would prefer narrower membership of EMU, limited to a core group of rich northern European countries, to ensure the new euro is as stable as the mark.</p>
<p>European ministers, however, argued against pre-judging who would join monetary union first. EU heads of state will make a decision in early 1998 on the basis of fiscal and monetary performances in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The question is quite simple, if you fulfil all the criteria you are in,&quot; Finnish Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto told Reuters in Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not in favour of pre-judgments which are of no value when we gather to make our decision,&quot; Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said.</p>
<p>Belgium Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt also said he hoped Italy would be in the first wave of countries joining monetary union at the start, while Spanish Finance Minister Rodrigo Rato praised Italy's budget efforts.</p>
<p>In Rome, political sources said Italy almost called off a summmit with France in Naples due later this week, until Chirac stated that he hoped Italy would join in 1999.</p>
<p>One European source attending the talks in Washington suggested that France might be trying to gain a stronger negotiating position in talks on the level at which the lira would rejoin the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).</p>
<p>Economists believe France, whose textile industry suffered from a sharp fall in the lira when it left the ERM in 1992 after a currency crisis, would like to see the Italian currency rejoin at a fairly high level.</p>
