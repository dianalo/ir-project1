<title>USA: Court upholds SEC's stand on insider trading lawsuits.</title>
<headline>Court upholds SEC's stand on insider trading lawsuits.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-12-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has won a court order upholding its &quot;misappropriation&quot; theory in insider trading cases, the agency said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The order, issued by Federal Judge J. Curtis Joyner in Pennsylvania, denied a motion for a summary judgment by defendant Marguerite Lenfest.</p>
<p>She and her husband, Gerry Lenfest, founder and chairman or privately-held cable TV company Lenfest Communications Inc., were charged in 1995 with insider trading violations stemming from the failed 1993 takeover attempt for Tele-Communications Inc. by Bell Atlantic Corp..</p>
<p>Gerry Lenfest was at the time a director of Liberty Media Corp., which owned 50 percent of Lenfest Communications and which was an affiliated of Tele-Communications.</p>
<p>He allegedly told Marguerite Lenfest on Oct. 7, 1993, about the possible merger between Liberty and Tele-Communications and that the combined entity might merge with Bell Atlantic.</p>
<p>Three days later, Mrs. Lenfest allegedly asked her son, Chase, then a stockbroker, to buy either Liberty or TCI stock for one of her investment accounts which he managed, the SEC alleged.</p>
<p>Chase Lenfest allegedly asked his father which of the two stocks he thought would make a better buy. Gerry Lenfest's response was that TCI would make a better purchase, the SEC alleged.</p>
<p>Chase Lenfest, who is not charged in the case, then bought 35,000 shares of TCI, 30,000 for himself and 5,000 for his mother. The purchase was made two days before Bell Atlantic announced the proposed deal.</p>
<p>Gerry Lenfest had denied that he or any member of his family misused any nonpublic information concerning the possible merger among the three companies. He also has denied telling his son about the possible deal.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lenfest, in seeking summary judgment, argued she could not be held liable for insider trading because she was not an insider of either Liberty or TCI.</p>
<p>Joyner rejected this, saying she may be held liable for violations of Section 10b of the 1934 Securities Act, a principal anti-insider trading tool used by the SEC. Under the provision, it is unlawful &quot;to employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud.&quot;</p>
<p>In the SEC's misappropriation theory, a person who trades on &quot;material nonpublic information need not be an insider or receive the information from an insider,&quot; in order to be held liable under Section 10b.</p>
<p>The SEC cited a two appeals court rulings backing its contention and with which Joyner agreed with.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs. Lenfest could arguably be said to have misappropriated information from her husband and used it to her benefit,&quot; Joyner said in the order.</p>
<p>Further, he said, Gerry Lenfest &quot;clearly has a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of Liberty&quot; as a director of the company &quot;and the information that Mrs. Lenfeset received was clearly inside information.&quot;</p>
<p>The agency said it expected its lawsuit against Gerry and Marguerite Lenfest to go to trial early this year. A lawyer representing the Lenfests was not available to comment.</p>
