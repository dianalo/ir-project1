<title>MACAU: East Timor Nobel laureate to visit Hong Kong.</title>

<p>The 1996 Nobel Peace Prize co-winner Jose Ramos-Horta paid tribute to the East Timorese resistance movement in exile on his arrival in the Portuguese enclave of Macau.</p>
<p>Ramos-Horta, a campaigner for freedom for the Indonesian-ruled territory of East Timor, said in Macau on Sunday his Nobel prize was a &quot;tribute to the whole resistance&quot; against East Timor's occupation by Indonesia&quot;.</p>
<p>He is scheduled to speak in Hong Kong on Tuesday, before returning to Australia, his country of exile.</p>
<p>Ramos-Horta, who shared the prize with East Timorese Bishop Carlos Belo, said the prize was also a tribute to the Portuguese government for its support for his resistance movement.</p>
<p>Ramos-Horta is to meet Macau's Portuguese Governor-General Vasco Rocha Vieira and East Timor exiles during his stay in the enclave.</p>
<p>Macau offers East Timorese refugees shelter and subsidies, allowing them to work and study in the territory.</p>
<p>Ramos-Horta, who was earlier denied a visitor's visa by the Philippines, refrained from criticising the country.</p>
<p>&quot;The Philippines is the most democratic ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) country,&quot; he said, adding he did not want to &quot;complicate things&quot;.</p>
<p>The Philippines barred Ramos-Horta from entering the country in November last year at the time of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit meeting.</p>
<p>But Manila said last week Ramos-Horta would be allowed to enter the country if the government was consulted before the visit. Media reports said the earlier decision to deny entry to him was taken to avoid embarrassing Indonesia, a close ally of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony of East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a year later. The United Nations does not recognise Jakarta as ruler of the territory and considers Portugal the administering power.</p>
