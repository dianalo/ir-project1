<p>Finance Minister Peter Medgyessy said on Thursday Hungary's capital markets will begin benefiting from the recently approved overhaul of the pension system in three years time.</p>
<p>&quot;Three to five year will pass before this will really move the capital markets, but the impact is expected to be felt already from the third year,&quot; Medgyessy told a news conference. &quot;The decision will affect the whole of society for many generations.&quot;</p>
<p>Parliament passed the pension reform bills on Tuesday, to supplement the Communist-type &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; system with private pension funds into which Hungarians will pay about 25 percent of compulsory pension contributions. The new system will start working in January 1998.</p>
<p>Medgyessy said the proportion of non-working people was increasing in Hungary and would make the old system un-financeable in the longer term.</p>
<p>By introducing the private tier Hungary was applying a solution used by many members of the European Union, Medgyessy said, adding that Poland also planned similar measures.</p>
<p>Medgyessy said the system would motivate people to work more and would reduce evasion of contribution payments, which he said was widespread.</p>
<p>According to the Finance Ministry's calculations, by the year 2005 the private funds will hold a total amount equivalent to some 4.2 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>He expected them to invest mainly in the country's fledgling capital markets but they could also become large across-the-border investors as they are allowed to invest a maximum 30 percent of their assets in securities issued abroad.</p>
<p>The launch of the new system will cause losses to the old social security pension fund, but the government will cover the fund's deficit, which is expected to remain below one percent of the GDP each year and turn into a surplus from 2003.</p>
<p>Medgyessy said Hungary will continue to overhaul the public sector using a gradual approach.</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot shock society continuously,&quot; he said, adding that preparations for health care reform were likely to finish by 1999 while work on the planned reform of the financing system of local municipalities will begin this autumn.</p>
