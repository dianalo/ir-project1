<title>USA: CBOT corn ends mixed, nearbys up on bull spreads.</title>
<headline>CBOT corn ends mixed, nearbys up on bull spreads.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-01-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Corn futures on the CBOT ended mixed Wednesday, with nearby contracts underpinned by bull spreading by commercial firms, floor traders said.</p>
<p>Iowa Grain spread two million March/May, ADM spread two million March/May and Continental Grain spread one million March/July, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Price pressure in the corn market was tied to reports from Argentina that rain fell and eased overly dry conditions for the developing corn crop, floor traders said.</p>
<p>Up to 60 percent of Argentina was said to have received moderate to heavy rain Tuesday, traders said.</p>
<p>The market's choppy tone was attributed to position squaring before the release of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's crop production report on Friday, some said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're just getting ready for Friday,&quot; a commission house trader said.</p>
<p>CBOT corn ended down one cent to up one cent per bushel, with March up one cent at $2.59-1/4 and May steady at $2.59-1/2.  </p>
<p>Some U.S. Midwestern grain merchandisers noted an increase in farmer selling Wednesday, and some saw that weighing on futures prices. Others said farmer selling was to be expected at this time of year.</p>
<p>On the day, Cargill bought one million bushels December and two million March and Refco bought 1.5 million March. Tenco bought two million bushels May and sold 2.5 million March.</p>
<p>In options trade, LFG bought 500 March $2.60 calls and Shatkin, Arbor and Karlow bought 300 March $2.80 calls.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 40,000 contracts, below the 38,003 traded Tuesday.</p>
