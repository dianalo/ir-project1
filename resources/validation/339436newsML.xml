<p>Taiwan share prices ended slightly lower on Tuesday for the third straight session as an early rebound failed ahead of the seven-day Chinese new year holiday starting on February 4, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index ended down 10.75 points or 0.15 percent at 7,146.21, off a mid-session high of 7,182.64. Turnover was comparatively slow at T$50.4 billion, compared with over T$100 billion in recent sessions.</p>
<p>The index had opened higher, boosted partly by Monday's news that the island's leading business indicators had risen for a fourth consecutive month in December.  </p>
<p>&quot;Caution emerged since the rising leading indicators were supported mainly by the loose monetary policy, not by the manufacturing side,&quot; said HSBC James Capel analyst Alex Chen.</p>
<p>Investors were concerned whether the central bank's loose money policy would change in the near term, brokers said, although the bank reiterated on Monday that it would maintain its stable-to-loose policy to help foster economic recovery.</p>
<p>Brokers said they did not expect any monetary policy shift in the near term. &quot;The loose money policy is needed in order to realise an economic recovery as well as for the government's state-share selling plan,&quot; Chen said.  </p>
<p>The government recently said it planned to release more than T$100 billion in state shares in fiscal 1997/98 (July/June) to alleviate financial deficits, but wants to sell at high levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The state-share selling plan is only possible when the stock market is doing well, and that's why the government has been so bullish toward the market recently,&quot; Chen said.</p>
<p>Electronics and financials fell. Plastics rose on producer price rises, with Union Petrochemical up 60 cents to T$38.70.</p>
<p>Brokers said they did not foresee major selling ahead of the lunar new year as most investors expect the government to make further bullish moves when post-holiday trading resumes.  </p>
<p>A 7,100-7,200 trading range was seen for Wednesday.</p>
