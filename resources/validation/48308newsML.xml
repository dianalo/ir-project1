<p>Blue-chip stocks rose Thursday as the August wholesale price report showed inflation was well under control, but the market was unable to sustain a rally into record territory as it braced for Friday's retail price data.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 17.02 points at 5,771.94 after rising as high as 5,794.13 -- above its record close of 5,778.00 set on May 22.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,464 to 860 on heavy volume of 398 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;Core producer prices were down a little bit and jobless claims were up. Now people are more sanguine about the Federal Open Market Committee meeting,&quot; said Hildegard Zagorski, an analyst at Prudential Securities.</p>
<p>Wall Street has been betting that the Federal Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, which meets on Sept. 24, would increase interest rates modestly to cool inflation pressures but now, investors are having second thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;Some are thinking the Fed won't do anything and the stock market is moving ahead,&quot; Zagorski said.</p>
<p>The Labour Department reported that wholesale prices rose moderately last month, providing new evidence that inflation remains under control despite strong economic growth.</p>
<p>The Producer Price Index edged up 0.3 percent last month, after showing no change in July. The more closely-watched &quot;core&quot; PPI, which factors out volatile food and energy costs, actually fell 0.1 percent after rising 0.1 percent in July.</p>
<p>In a separate report, the government said new applications for unemployment benefits rose by 21,000 last week, with new filings jumping to 338,000, further calming fears that the economy was nearing so-called full employment, which could fuel wage inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;The PPI made the market happy, and tomorrow's Consumer Price Index is seen relatively stable,&quot; said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.</p>
<p>On Friday, the government will release the Consumr Price Index for August.</p>
<p>In the inflation-sensitive bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond was up 14/32 and its yield fell to 7.08 percent from Wednesday's close of 7.11 percent.</p>
<p>Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany, said the stock market's rally was broad-based.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a good story here for economically sensitive stocks and a good story for consumer growth stocks,&quot; he said. &quot;That happens only when investors believe that it will be a Goldilocks economy -- not too hot or too cold.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnson said the PPI report and the Federal Reserve's comment Wednesday in its Beige Book report, which said the economy seemed to be expanding moderately, may still prompt Fed to raise interest rates by a token one-quarter percentage point later this month.</p>
<p>Among individual stocks, Duracell jumped 9-7/8 to 58-1/4 and Gillette added 1 to 66 after the companies agreed to merge in a $7 billion stock-swap deal.</p>
<p>Xerox lost 3 to 54-7/8 on news that Xerox and the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts called off an agreement to sell Xerox's Talegen Holdings insurance businesses to a group of investors led by KKR for $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>Microsoft rose 3-1/2 to 128-5/8 after it outlined an aggressive rollout of several new Internet-based products and services.</p>
<p>Motorola extended its loss, dropping 1-1/4 to 47-3/4 after losing 1-5/8 Wednesday on the company's warning that it will report poor results for the third quarter.</p>
<p>U.S. Robotics rose 4-7/8 to 61-3/4 on expectations the company would have a faster modem on the market by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index rose 11.86 to 1,165.81.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 3.85 to 671.13. The American Stock Exchange index was up 0.60 to 566.66.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 1.73 to 359.73. The average share was up 19 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 6,586.363 up 38.23 or 0.58 percent.</p>
