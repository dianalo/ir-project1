<p>This is the full text of the announcement.</p>
<p>-----------PRESS RELEASE----------------------------</p>
<p>SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 26, 1996--L.A. Gear Inc. (NYSE:LA) Tuesday announced that, in light of continuing operating losses, the company has adopted a cost-reduction plan aimed at bringing the company's operating expenses in line with its anticipated sales base.</p>
<p>This plan primarily consists of the following key elements: --  an approximately 55 percent reduction in the company's full-time domestic workforce (from approximately 310 to 140 employees); --  reduction of corporate overhead through space consolidation at the company's Santa Monica headquarters and Ontario, Calif., distribution center; and --  a consolidation and restructuring of the company's European operations, including, where appropriate, servicing the company's European customers through independent distributors, rather than a direct subsidiary sales force.</p>
<p>The company anticipates that its fourth quarter operating results will be adversely affected by between $28 million and $33 million of restructuring charges in connection with the implementation of this plan.  It is anticipated that approximately $17 million to $20 million of the estimated restructuring charge will be of a non-cash nature, primarily related to asset write-downs and goodwill write-offs associated with certain of the company's European subsidiaries.</p>
<p>The domestic workforce reductions will occur in the first quarter of fiscal 1997, and substantially all of the estimated cash costs associated with the plan will be incurred over the next six to 12 months.  As previously disclosed, the company anticipates a loss for the fourth quarter and year ended Nov. 30, 1996.</p>
<p>The company also announced that William L. Benford, president and chief operating officer, will join Shamrock Capital Advisors Inc. in early February 1997.  Effective immediately, Bruce MacGregor will assume Benford's duties on an interim basis.</p>
<p>MacGregor previously served as vice president-marketing at Avia and co-founder, president and chief executive officer of Deja Shoe, before joining the company in August 1996 as senior vice president-product marketing.  Prior to his departure, Benford will assist in the transition, and be responsible for the implementation of certain key elements of the company's restructuring plan. Benford will continue to serve on the company's board of directors.</p>
<p>In addition, the company announced that Victor J. Trippetti has been elevated to the position of senior vice president and chief financial officer.  Trippetti joined the company in October 1989, and has served as vice president and treasurer since July 1992.</p>
<p>Stanley P. Gold, chairman of the board, said, &quot;We have endeavored to streamline the organization, while maintaining the company's focus on its heritage as a premier designer and marketer of women's and children's footwear.</p>
<p>&quot;By consistently reinforcing the ultimate importance of retailer and consumer satisfaction in every element of our sales, marketing and product design and development programs, we will seek to enhance brand image, generate increased sales velocity with existing customers, attract new customers and increase penetration into international markets.</p>
<p>&quot;It is only by taking bold measures to position the company to compete effectively in an intensely competitive and consolidating branded athletic footwear industry that we can continue to strive toward a return to profitability and enhanced shareholder value.&quot;</p>
