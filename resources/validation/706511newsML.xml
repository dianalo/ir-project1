<p>The dramatic de facto devaluation of the Thai baht on Wednesday was not necessarily a victory by speculators against the currency, as some media reports have suggested, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a lot of short (positions) in the market at the end of May, but a lot of them gave up, covered their positions and slunk off,&quot; one trader at a European bank said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, there were people that made money, but overall I would say there's no way the speculators won,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Towards the end of May speculators launched a huge attack against the baht. They aggressively shorted the currency -- that is, sold baht they did not have in anticipation of buying them back at a lower rate later.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand saw off the initial attack but was then faced with speculators who had shorted the currency in the forward market -- the market for baht for delivery in up to a year's time.</p>
<p>International financier George Soros has been tipped in press stories as being a potential winner in the baht devaluation stakes. But traders tend to dispute this.</p>
<p>&quot;I've read the reports that Soros was short four yards (US$4 billion) in the forwards. Nonsense. He may have been short quite an amount, but you can't really hide a $4 billion position. We'd have seen him doing it and we didn't,&quot; the head of Treasury at a European investment bank said.</p>
<p>Soros himself declined to comment to Reuters on Wednesday on the baht devaluation but in an interview he did say: &quot;I don't want to comment on the baht because we've been attacked by the Thai government and there have been some exaggerated rumours.&quot;</p>
<p>The traders said the timing of the Bank of Thailand's de facto devaluation -- which it engineered via a &quot;managed float&quot; -- was probably very much tied to the number of speculators left with short baht forward positions.</p>
<p>The head of Treasury said: &quot;The Bank had done all the hard work seeing the speculators off in May. I'm sure they wouldn't throw in the towel and hand money on a plate to a load of short speculators six weeks later.</p>
<p>&quot;My conclusion is that they waited for the bulk of speculators to bail out of their own accord -- these positions are pricey to run, you know -- and then do the sensible thing and devalue,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Another trader at a U.S. firm concurred. &quot;The Bank of Thailand lost four billion dollars of foreign exchange reserves in May. The last thing they'd want to have done is to let the speculators win,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I reckon they waited for the bulk of positions to be closed off, but this is only my guess. August will be very interesting,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Towards the end of August, any three-month positions established at the time of the initial speculative attack on the baht in May will unwind.</p>
