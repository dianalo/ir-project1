<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan shipper says China sailing request denied.</title>
<headline>Taiwan shipper says China sailing request denied.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1996-08-29</dateline>

<p>A Taiwan shipper said on Thursday its application to sail directly to China from the island had been rejected by its Chinese counterpart, clouding direct shipping links between the rivals.</p>
<p>On August 20, China issued rules governing direct shipping links across the Taiwan Strait, effective immediately, but Taiwan gave a cool response, saying Beijing's rules were &quot;mingled with sensitive political issues&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We sent documents to the shipping company in (China's) Xiamen telling them we wanted to sail from (Taiwan's) Kaohsiung to Xiamen,&quot; said a manager of Kien Hung Shipping Co Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;But they said the application could not be accepted because they haven't prepared such application forms,&quot; the manager, who declined to be named, said by telephone.</p>
<p>He said requests from other Taiwanese shippers for direct shipping links were also denied by Chinese counterparts.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the problem is only paperwork,&quot; the manager said. &quot;We will apply again when their forms are ready.&quot;</p>
<p>China's regulations allow wholly Chinese-owned or Taiwan-owned shipping companies or joint ventures involving Chinese or Taiwanese shipowners to sail between the two sides.</p>
<p>Taiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists lost the civil war to the Chinese communists and fled to the island in 1949. Taiwan investors, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, have pressured their government to establish direct links to save transport costs.</p>
<p>To fulfil its ambition of becoming a regional hub, Taiwan proposed in 1995 to set up an offshore transshipment centre at southern Kaohsiung port from which ships would be allowed to sail directly between Taiwan and China.</p>
<p>The project has been delayed by sovereignty issues.</p>
<p>Taiwan insists on a transshipment centre, from which no goods would be allowed through its customs.</p>
<p>With tensions easing since the late 1980s, civilian aircraft and vessels have skirted the ban by stopping over in Hong Kong, Macau or another third place.</p>
