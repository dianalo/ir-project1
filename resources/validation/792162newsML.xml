<p>The international community came to the rescue of financially strapped Thailand on Monday, pledging a total of $16 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Asian nations led by Japan.</p>
<p>The offer is the largest loan package to a single country since the IMF and donors led by the United States made nearly $40 billion available to Mexico in 1995.</p>
<p>Thailand -- long one of Southeast Asia's booming &quot;tiger economies&quot; -- had been looking for $12 billion to $15 billion to plug financial holes created when it floated its baht currency last month after failing to defend the currency from speculative attacks.</p>
<p>IMF deputy managing director Shigemitsu Sugisaki told a news conference that the IMF had estimated that Thailand needed funds in the order of $14 billion for 1997 and 1998 and that participants had supported the request.</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting proceeded very smoothly and positively. Some $16 billion in financial support was promised, including the proposed IMF contribution of $4 billion,&quot; Sugisaki said.</p>
<p>Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya told the same news conference that the package would basically be used to shore up Bangkok's foreign reserves.</p>
<p>Japan, which hosted the meeting, pledged to match the $4 billion to be provided by the IMF.</p>
<p>Analysts said that while Japan wanted the IMF to take the formal lead in forging the package, Tokyo had no alternative but to accept a big part of the burden to ease Bangkok's credit crunch and prevent a chain reaction in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;This very credible economic adjustment package and financing package for Thailand should restore calm to financial markets in this region and restore calmness to the currencies of this region,&quot; Joseph Yam, Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive, told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>The United States did not pledge individual aid, but will support the package through the IMF, the IMF's Sugisaki said.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of who has more at stake, it's pretty clear -- Japan has more at stake,&quot; said Ron Bevacqua, an economist at Merrill Lynch Japan.</p>
<p>Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong pledged to contribute $1 billion each to the effort, while South Korea and Indonesia would each give $500 million in loans, Sugisaki said.</p>
<p>Contributions from China, which is seriously considering joining the aid package, and funds from the Asian Development Bank and World Bank may provide another $3 billion of the total.</p>
<p>Bangkok last week unveiled an austerity package to meet IMF demands, raising its value-added tax, announcing plans to cut its current account deficit and closing more than half of its financial institutions.</p>
<p>On Monday, Thailand's cabinet approved a broad outline to cut its 1997/98 (October-September) budget by 50 billion to 70 billion baht ($1.6 billion to $2.3 billion) and will review details on August 19, a government spokesman told Reuters in Bangkok.</p>
<p>Thailand's sharp economic slowdown has reduced its tax revenue and is yielding the nation's first budget deficits in a decade this year and in fiscal 1997/98.</p>
<p>Thai exports, meanwhile, rose about 23 percent year-on-year in July following the baht's more than 20 percent depreciation last month, the Thai Customs Department said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We realise the devaluation of the baht will create some inflationary pressure in Thailand but somehow we feel it is a necessary step to make Thai exports more competitive,&quot; Thanong said, adding he hoped to keep inflation below 10 percent while reducing the current account deficit to about five percent this year, and three percent in the following two years.</p>
<p>Thanong is set to meet representatives from 21 Japanese banks on Tuesday to request additional support, possibly in the form of rolling over their existing loans to Thailand.</p>
<p>&quot;We will...try to assure them that the IMF programme has been done. We have been trying our best to restore the economic condition of Thailand back to normal,&quot; Thanong said.</p>
<p>Thailand has $89 billion in foreign currency debt and Japanese banks are owed about half that amount, he said.</p>
<p>Apart from the IMF and Thailand, the meeting was attended by officials of the United States, Japan, Australia, Canada, China, Britain, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
