<p>Some 61 countries on Saturday prepared to endorse a landmark deal opening up the world's booming telecommunications trade to competition in a big boost to the industry and the information superhighway.</p>
<p>European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said a deal was essentially done after a top U.S. negotiator signalled on Friday that Washington, after months of playing hard, had eased its stance and was ready to sign up.</p>
<p>The United States, the world's largest telecoms market, holds the key to success in the talks and walked away from a deal last year, saying offers on the table were not good enough.</p>
<p>Just hours before the midnight Geneva deadline (2300 GMT) for agreement in the World Trade Organisation-sponsored negotiations, Brittan said: &quot;Essentially we have a deal.&quot;</p>
<p>He told a news conference that further talks would only fill in &quot;final details and formalities.&quot;</p>
<p>On Friday, Washington's Deputy Trade Representative Jeffrey Lang indicated the United States was ready to sign an accord by Saturday's deadline.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a good possibility of success,&quot; Lang told reporters after a meeting of negotiators to assess prospects for a deal. &quot;We're making progress and can see the way forward.&quot;</p>
<p>The new pact would give a big boost to the $600 billion telecoms industry, already one of the most dynamic in the world, according to the United Nations International Telecommunications Union (ITU).</p>
<p>An ITU survey predicted on Friday that world revenues from the industry, including that from equipment, could almost double to more than $1.2 trillion by the year 2000 if a deal is struck.</p>
<p>Brittan said the pact would slash telephone costs for ordinary people and businesses around the globe, speed up the digital revolution and boost the two-year-old WTO.</p>
<p>&quot;A WTO deal on telecoms services today will give a powerful lift to the globalisation of telecoms markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition to what this deal will do for the telecoms industry, it is a major step also in the creation of the information society.&quot;</p>
<p>Throughout the talks, the United States, the world's largest single telecoms market, held the key to success. Washington walked away from a deal last year, saying the tabled offers, particularly from emerging nations, were not good enough.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. announced on Friday that it would add curbs on satellite transmission of some television and audio services to its offer on the table, other trading powers made clear they were still ready for an accord.</p>
<p>Trade diplomats said the restrictions were primarily aimed at Ottawa whose own offer was strongly criticised by Washington.</p>
<p>WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero has set success in the talks, left over from the 1986-93 Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations, as top priority for the fledgling body.</p>
<p>Brittan said the newly-announced U.S. restrictions -- applying to one-way satellite transmissions of some television services and digital audio services -- violated Washington's commitments under the Uruguay Round accords.</p>
<p>Although the EU had been assured that the curbs -- which he said were not of great significance -- would not be applied to European entrants to the U.S. telecom market, Brussels would reserve its right to a possible challenge in the WTO.</p>
