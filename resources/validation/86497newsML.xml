<p>Australian bond spreads had a mixed day on Monday, reflecting the subdued performance of the market overall.</p>
<p>Attention remains firmly focussed on Tuesday's Reserve Bank of Australia board meeting, and the slew of U.S. data, including September payrolls, due this week.</p>
<p>As such, after bonds opened softer, the short end of the curve was the best performer, reflected in a contuination of last week's trend towards steeper cash and futures curves.</p>
<p>The spread to 10-year U.S. bonds remained near the 110 level that it has traded around for the past week.</p>
<p>Economists believe that the rapid spreads narrowing may be nearing an end, but said that given the recent performance of local bonds, and the bullish tone of the market, a narrowing below 100 basis points could not be ruled out.</p>
<p>&quot;With the spread getting down to 110 points at the moment, or around about that, it's looking somewhat stretched and vulnerable,&quot; AMP Investments chief economist Shane Oliver said, saying the spread reflected a fundamnetal savings problem.</p>
<p>&quot;But as we all know in the short term markets focus on other things rather than the longer term fundmentals, and all of the other things...such as inflation, the possibility of an easing in monetary policy, the cyclical improvement in the current account ... all of those things suggest there is a risk that the spread does come down further,&quot; he said.</p>
