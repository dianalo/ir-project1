<p>U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Monday urged Japan to speed up implementation of its planned &quot;Big Bang&quot; financial reforms while tackling its banking system's bad loan woes at the same time.</p>
<p>Greenspan, in Tokyo for two days of meetings with Japanese financial and monetary officials, made the plea in a chat with Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, a ministry official told reporters.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto last week unveiled a five-year &quot;Big Bang&quot; plan to liberalise Japan's financial markets by 2001 in order to catch up with reforms carried out more than a decade ago in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Greenspan welcomed the plans and urged Mitsuzuka to speed up the process, the ministry official said.</p>
<p>He also said U.S. securities houses, which went through the same process of brokerage commission liberalisation in 1975, had worried at the time that liberalisation of commission fees would affect their profits. But trading volume increased and the liberalisation proved a success, he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The two men also discussed currencies, but the official declined comment on the content of their remarks on the topic.</p>
<p>Greenspan, who as chairman of the Fed heads the U.S. central banking system, welcomed Japan's efforts to increase the independence of its central bank and make the Bank of Japan's decision-making on monetary policy more transparent.</p>
<p>In remarks later to the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan, Greenspan said those moves were critical to Japan's overall financial liberalisation.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong reason to support the initiatives put forth by the prime minister and the finance minister to create significantly increased competition in Japanese financial markets, and I must say I feel an integral part of that is a major move toward increased independence on the part of the Bank of Japan,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Last week, advisers to the prime minister proposed giving the Bank of Japan more say in forming monetary policy, but stopped short of suggesting it be given the independence which some of its foreign peers enjoy.</p>
<p>The advisory panel proposed curbing some of the government's authority over the central bank, but also said the Bank of Japan should disclose more about its operations.</p>
<p>Greenspan also said he suspected certain practices in Japan's financial system had long since become obsolete, but were difficult to change.</p>
<p>The ministry official also quoted Greenspan as saying that the European Union's move towards economic union would create a larger economic power than Japan or the United States.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka told Greenspan that Japan's financial firms were dealing with their bad loan problems and Tokyo's financial system could handle the situation, the official said.</p>
<p>Japan's banking system has been struggling with the legacy of bad loans inherited after the bursting of its late 1980s &quot;bubble economy&quot; of sky-high land and share prices. Most big banks are past the worst of the problem, but smaller institutions still face difficulties.</p>
