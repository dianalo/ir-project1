<p>Russia, accusing the Georgian parliament of &quot;political blackmail&quot;, said on Monday it was considering whether or not to keep its peacekeeping troops around Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region beyond next month.</p>
<p>The Georgian parliament is &quot;forcing us to rethink the advisability of the further presence of Russian peacekeepers in the conflict zone and the possibility of fulfilling their mandate,&quot; President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman and foreign affairs adviser was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>The Georgian parliament passed a resolution last week seeking to end the Russian peacekeepers' mandate in Abkhazia if no progress was made in bringing peace to the region by the end of their current mandate on August 1.</p>
<p>Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Yeltsin's spokesman, called that &quot;political blackmail&quot;.</p>
<p>Observers say the departure of the peacekeepers could pave the way for a renewal of fighting between the separatists and Georgian government forces.</p>
<p>Russian troops act as peacekeepers in the Gali region, controlling a zone separating Georgia from the Black Sea province of Abkhazia. Abkhazia has run itself as a de facto independent state since driving Georgian forces out in 1993.</p>
<p>Nearly four years of peace talks have reached a dead end. The Abkhaz still want more independence than Georgia is ready to tolerate.</p>
<p>The Tbilisi government is demanding that the 2,500 Russian peacekeepers patrolling the buffer zone take on a more aggressive mandate, helping refugees from the region resettle and expanding their zone of activity.</p>
<p>Georgia said last week it was claiming a part of the Black Sea Fleet, further raising tensions with Russia just as Moscow and Kiev reached an agreement on the long-disputed issue.</p>
<p>Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze said Soviet-built ships based in the Georgian port of Poti had been spirited away in 1992 &quot;without the agreement and without consultation with the Georgian government&quot;.</p>
<p>Russia insists that Georgia received its full share of the assets of the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Also on Monday, a Russian sergeant shot dead 10 of his fellow servicemen in a peacekeeping unit in Abkhazia and then killed himself, sources with the Russian military in Tbilisi said. The incident did not appear to be politically motivated.</p>
