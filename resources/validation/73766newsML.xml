<p>The deputy governor of Sweden's central bank, Lars Heikensten, said on Tuesday the Swedish economy was on track for healthy growth in 1996 and 1997 but warned that wage increases had been too high this year.  </p>
<p>He said the bank's inflation report, released earlier Tuesday, continued to paint a good picture of economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;We make clear in the inflation report that we are less worried about a deep recession than we were in the spring,&quot; Heikensten told Reuters Financial Television (RFTV).</p>
<p>&quot;In fact we think that the Swedish economy will have quite healthy growth in 1996 and 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he did not think growth in the coming years would add to inflationary pressure, as he did not see growth above two percent a year over the next two years.</p>
<p>But he said there were concerns about wages pressures, and he saw this as the main source of potential inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not too worried for the next year or two primarily because we don't think that demand wil be strong enough to leave room for prices to go up,&quot; Heikensten said.</p>
<p>&quot;But in a longer perspective the wages increases we have had here during 1996 are clearly too high.&quot;</p>
<p>Heikensten said he expected productivity would develop in Sweden in line with its European partners in coming years given that Sweden has a macroeconomic regime similar to the others.</p>
<p>&quot;I would expect us to have more or less the same room for wage increases as there will be in the rest of Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Given we have an inflation target of around two percent... probably we are talking about wage rises of three percent or so.</p>
<p>&quot;But I would not put too emphasis on the exact figure. It will depend on productivity and development.&quot;</p>
