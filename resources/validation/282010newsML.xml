<p>South Korea's unions marked the New Year holidays by calling off strikes over a controversial labour law, but threatened to wage fresh action early next year, this time targeting the public sector.</p>
<p>Having brought chaos to motor vehicle manufacturing and shipyards, the outlawed Korea Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) on Monday declared a break to spare the public over the holidays.</p>
<p>The nation's largest umbrella union group, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) followed suit on Tuesday, calling for members to postpone strikes until January 11.</p>
<p>In a statement, the federation said: &quot;We are postponing the strikes in order to gather our strength for a longer, more determined struggle.&quot;</p>
<p>The unions are demanding the government withdraw a labour law pushed through parliament last week that gives companies the right to lay off employees, hire temporary workers and replace strikers.</p>
<p>South Korean police detained eleven representatives of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday as they attempted to deliver a petition to President Kim Young-sam demanding that the labour law be revoked.</p>
<p>About 40 unionists headed for a hot spring resort in northern Chungchong province, where Kim is spending the New Year holidays.</p>
<p>&quot;Twelve were detained by riot police, but one was immediately released,&quot; union official Min Dong-won said.</p>
<p>The confederation said that 49 union members have been detained since the strikes began on December 26. All but the most recent eleven unionists have been released.</p>
<p>The two umbrella groups claim an aggregate 1.7 million members in most of South Korea's major industries, including auto manufacturing, shipbuilding and public sector services, such as subways and hospitals.</p>
<p>No date was set for the resumption of the FKTU's industrial action. However, the federation said it would immediately launch strikes again &quot;if the government and employers try to resolve the issue with force&quot;.</p>
<p>The more militant KCTU said it will ask unions of automakers, shipyards, metal workers and manufacturers to walk out again on Friday after a two-day New Year holiday.</p>
<p>Unionised employees at hospitals, the Hyundai Group, construction and chemical firms and white-collar workers will join them on January 6. On January 7, subway and broadcast unions are set to strike, the confederation said.</p>
<p>The FKTU said its second round of strikes will be led by unions in the public and service sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;We will link the strikes to wage negotiations, work more closely with the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and other citizens' coalitions, build stepping stones to work with the opposition parties and fight against the New Korea Party during next year's elections,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>President Kim Young-sam's ruling New Korea Party pushed through the labour law at a clandestine session of the National Assembly on Thursday.</p>
<p>Union workers at Daewoo Motor Co returned to work on Tuesday. Union officials said the union would meet on Friday to decide whether to resume industrial action.</p>
<p>Unions at other major automakers, including Ssangyong Motor, Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, said on Tuesday they planned to continue stoppages after the holidays.</p>
<p>On Monday, subway drivers returned to work after a two-day walkout, while nurses and hospital orderlies also agreed to return.</p>
