<p>Austrian industrial group Radex-Heraklith (RHI) on Thursday posted a six percent rise in group pre-tax profit in the first half to 220 million schillings ($17.1 million) and forecast strong earnings for the full year.</p>
<p>Group turnover slipped to 10.27 billion schillings from 10.37 billion in the same 1996 period, a decline the company blamed on consolidation and an ongoing restructuring programme.</p>
<p>&quot;With the positive economic trend especially in the steel industry in Western Europe, we expect to see a return on sales of four percent for the full year and we aim for five percent in 1998,&quot; chief executive Walter Ressler told a news conference.</p>
<p>The company said results in both its divisions -- fireproof materials/engineering and insulation -- had improved considerably in the second quarter of 1997 after a poor first quarter.</p>
<p>The fireproof materials division enjoyed some growth in the United States and in Western Europe, boosted by an improved product mix and cost restructuring. Even so, sales were almost unchanged at 7.67 billion schillings in the first six months from 7.61 billion same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Prices in the fireproof materials division were likely to rise by 1.5 percent this year, board member Guenther Moertl said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the current economic trend continues we should see a 1.5 percent price increase next year too,&quot; he noted.</p>
<p>Earnings in the division were hit in the first quarter by restructuring costs at U.S. subsidiary NARCO, as well as one-off repairs and clean-up costs from floods.</p>
<p>Sales in engineering slipped to 706 million schillings from 893 million. RHI forecast earnings in the engineering division and NARCO would even out by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In the insulation division sales remained virtually stagnant at 1.9 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to see a significantly better result in the insulation division, despite a continuing stagnation in the building industry in the core markets of Germany and Austria,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>Regarding acquistions, Ressler said RHI would consolidate its position before embarking on new projects, although Asia remained an attractive prospect.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not in a hurry and have no concrete plans for any new acquisitions,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to build up shareholder confidence and realise our goals without watering down share value through acquisitions,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Financial director Hans Joerg Kaltenbrunner said an important development in the first half was an increase in the number of U.S. institutional investors following a strong drive to build up its client base in the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. institutionals now hold 10 percent of RHI stock.</p>
<p>Ressler also said RHI's participation in a consortium bidding for Austria's third GSM licence would cost less than 10 million schillings if it proved unsuccessful.</p>
<p>If the consortium were to win the bid, RHI would have the option to raise its stake to 30 percent within a six year period, he noted, but would not reveal RHI's current stake.</p>
<p>RHI shares closed up nine schillings at 570 in an overall strong Vienna market. ($ = 12.89 Austrian Schillings)</p>
