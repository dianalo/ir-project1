<p>Orange Plc, Britain's youngest mobile telephone company, outran two of its rivals on Tuesday by winning the most net new customers in the second quarter of the year.</p>
<p>But its 86,000 net new subscribers failed to impress some analysts, who noted that mobile telephone prices in Britain continue to be too high for new market growth to meet industry estimates.</p>
<p>Despite recent moves to cut prices, which have left tariffs at the bottom end of the market almost a third lower than in April, they remain more than 30 percent higher than in the high penetration, high growth countries in Europe, according to Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>&quot;Subscriber additions will continue to slow down unless prices are reduced,&quot; agreed Oliver Ehrenberg, telecoms analyst at Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>Orange, which operates a purely digital network and now has 980,000 customers, also said that earnings before interest, tax and depreciation (EBITDA) had turned positive. The shares closed five pence higher at 203.5p.</p>
<p>Since the start of the year its customer base has grown by 25 percent although the level of churn -- when customers cancel subscriptions -- is creeping up to just under 20 percent.</p>
<p>Cellnet, the second biggest mobile telecoms operator that saw new subscriber levels plunge to 12,000 last quarter, said it had added 74,000 net new subscribers this time.</p>
<p>The group, which is 60 percent owned by British Telecommuncations Plc, blamed tighter credit controls and new contract terms for the sharp fall in new customers in the last quarter.</p>
<p>Cellnet now has a total of 2.77 million customers and said that for the first time, the number of customers using its digital network had overtaken analogue users -- -- of which there are 1.33 million.</p>
<p>Vodafone Group Plc, the market leader, said it had won 53,000 net new customers in the three months. It blamed a reduction to 12 months from 15 months of its customer contracts for the loss of 35,000 new customers.</p>
<p>&quot;With this out of the way, the UK growth coupled with our excellent overseas connections sees us well on track to connect a million net new customers in the year,&quot; promised chief executive Chris Gent in a statement.</p>
<p>Overseas, the group which now has 4.25 million customers, said it had added more than 182,000 net new subscribers with continued strong performances from its businesses in Greece, South Africa, France and the Netherlands. The shares ended 4.0p up at 296.5p.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected Orange, which has built on its reputation for innovation, to take the largest share of net new customers although One-2-One, jointly owned by Cable &amp; Wireless and US West Inc, is also expected to have reaped the benefit from new tariffs.</p>
<p>One2One, the smallest mobile operator, was not immediately available to detail its quarterly subscriber figures.</p>
