<p>The Indonesian central bank surprised the market on Friday by widening the dollar-rupiah band in the middle of regional currency volatility.</p>
<p>Bank Indonesia, the central bank, told Reuters on Friday it had decided to widen its dollar-rupiah intervention band to 12 percent from eight percent effective immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;We have widened the band to 12 percent from eight percent,&quot; Djakaria, director of the foreign exchange department, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the eighth widening since 1992,&quot; he said, adding that the new band was set at 2,374-2,678 rupiah to the dollar.</p>
<p>Since 1992, the central bank has widened the intervention band in steps to give more room for price fluctuations to absorb external and internal shocks.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market had been speculating on a band widening in the past few days but the central bank timing took the market by surprise.</p>
<p>They said the market's initial reaction was to sell dollars, with the first deal seen at 2,410 rupiah before the dollar recovered gradually to its previous level at 2,437.</p>
<p>However, regional volatility following a devaluation of the Philippines peso on Friday and the Thai baht last week caused the rupiah to weaken to 2,440 to the dollar in European trade.</p>
<p>But economists remained comfortable with the rupiah.</p>
<p>&quot;It's coming at a time when there was a lot of market volatility but I would emphasise this widening is no way due to market pressure on the rupiah,&quot; Winston Koh, vice president for market research at JP Morgan in Singapore, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainlly it's a surprise, coming in the midst of all the volatility. But the rupiah has never been pressured, even after the floatation of the baht,&quot; Koh said, adding that attention was centred more on the Malaysia ringgit and the Philippine peso.</p>
<p>&quot;The rupiah has actually been very steady. So this is a widening from a position of stability, not from a position of pressure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Daragh Maher, economist of Ing Barings, said earlier any effect on the rupiah due to a spillover from other currencies would be shortlived.</p>
<p>He said stable economic growth, the long-term nature of foreign debt and controllable short-term private debt were among factors helping to shield the rupiah from speculation.</p>
<p>Pardy Kendy, treasury head of PT Bank Buana Indonesia, said the central bank move was a pre-emptive one with regards to currency volatility in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's a timely move before we got driven into turbulences like the baht, peso and the ringgit,&quot; Kendy said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's better to take action to calm the market before the minor disturbances snowballed into something bigger,&quot; he said, adding there was some dollar buying on the spillover from peso.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides, it does give value-added to the donor meeting in Tokyo next week,&quot; Kendy said.</p>
<p>The Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI), a grouping of donor nations and financial institutions led by the World Bank, is due to meet next week in Tokyo to decide on the amount of loans to the country. Indonesia hoped to obtain for $5.3 billion in new loans from the CGI to finance its projects.</p>
<p>Indonesia had addressed some of the concerns raised by the World Bank in its latest report on Indonesia which said growth momentum had slowed down and property loans were rising.</p>
<p>The government cut import tariffs on 1,600 items and banned loans for land purchase and development on the property sector.</p>
<p>The World Bank did not specifically advise the central bank to widen its dollar-rupiah band. But it did say some other countries maintained wider bands than Indonesia.</p>
<p>The bank said international experience underscored the importance of putting in place an adequately-wide band prior to the onset of any crises.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe, after the volatility in the market has passed, investors will start focusing on the long-term value of the rupiah again,&quot; Koh said.</p>
