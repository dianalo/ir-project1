<p>British chemicals giant ICI capped an almost unprecedented borrowing spree by a corporate in international bond markets by raising $1.5 billion in floating-rate notes on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The deals took ICI towards the $4 billion mark in the past month as it continued to refinance loans taken out after its $8 billion acquisition of Unilever's speciality chemicals business in May.</p>
<p>&quot;They have achieved quite a lot and there may be a pause now,&quot; a banker at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, lead manager of today's offerings said.</p>
<p>Among corporate issuers, only Glaxo-Wellcome, in the wake of its merger, had previously come close to such sustained short-term Euromarket issuance, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact they have raised so much so quickly should be seen a positive factor. That they could move so quickly after the Unilver deal is a great sign of market confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>Four public deals from ICI in dollars and sterling since July 18 have totalled around $2.65 billion. It has also raised around $800 million in the MTN market and issued CP in the same period, dealers said.</p>
<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said today's financing, like the previous issues, was well received with investors buying on the basis of the company's story that it planned to return to being a solid single-A credit.</p>
<p>ICI was downgraded to Baa1 by Moodys and A- by S&amp;P after news of the Unilever acquisition.</p>
<p>ICI went some way to footing the Unilever bill in early July by selling its polyester unit and most of its titanium dioxide operations to U.S. chemicals giant DuPont for $3 billion.</p>
<p>ICI said the sale was a &quot;decisive step&quot; in its goal of moving from the unpredictable world of bulk chemicals into high margin, consumer-led niches of speciality chemicals.</p>
<p>The disposal to DuPont, which followed a 100 million stg sale and lease-back deal on its London headquarters and the sale of its stake in ICI Australia, immediately cut the massive interest charges being paid by the group.</p>
<p>ICI has been rewarded for its efforts by the stock market, with its share price at around 1,080 pence stg at 1320 GMT from 810p before the DuPont announcement in July.</p>
<p>Today's ICI deals were three $500 million FRNs with maturities of 12, 15 and 18 months.</p>
<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said there was strong demand from money managers and treasury funds in the far east and London looking for short-dated paper yielding above LIBOR.</p>
<p>Paper was being sold in size with at least one buyer of a $50 million ticket amid ticket sizes of $20-$30 million.</p>
<p>Today's three issues all pay three-month LIBOR plus 6.25 basis points. The longer-dated deals are callable at par on coupon dates from September 1998.</p>
