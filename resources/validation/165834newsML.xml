<p>Chicago wheat futures fell on Tuesday to new contract lows as speculative funds sold the market on talk of good supply. But excitement that moved equities and bonds over the US elections and apparent success of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's heart surgery failed to stir the commodity sector. A dull day in most markets saw few significant price movements.</p>
<p>Backdrop to the latest fall in Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) wheat futures is that bumper crops in many nations have followed earlier drought which depressed world food stocks to the lowest in 20 years.</p>
<p>Prices below $3.75 per bushel contrast with several months when they were above $5.00 and a spike in March to an all-time high of $7.50.</p>
<p>Traders said the overall good to excellent condition of the U.S. winter wheat crop contributed to the slide to a new low for March at $3.64 per bushel, down from $3.65-1/2 set Friday.</p>
<p>The US Department of Agriculture says 75 percent of the U.S. winter wheat crop was good to excellent as of Sunday. A year ago only 56 percent of the crop was in the good to excellent category. Funds sold at least five million bushels.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in commodity markets, aluminium was firmer at around $1,430 per tonne on light shortcovering supported by news of a decline in warehouse stocks and amid forecasts of rising prices for the key industrial metal. Prices are expected to average $1,600 a tonne and possibly peak above $2,000 in 1997, brokerage GNI Ltd said in their latest Commodity Perspective report. Sergio Marchionne, who is to become chief executive of producer Alusuisse-Lonza Holding AG next April, said in an interview that he believed aluminium prices would be restored to a level above $1,500 per tonne soon.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there will be a restoration of prices above $1,500 at the end of the year or beginning of 1997,&quot; he said. Copper was just easier on the London Metal Exchange and largely becalmed ahead of an options declaration on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Gold closed in London at $379.45 an ounce after $379.05 on Friday and the world benchmark Brent Blend of crude oil was trading around $22.50, also little changed from late Monday afternoon in London.</p>
<p>Robusta coffee futures ended mostly firmer but remained rangebound at the close on Tuesday with the market showing little response to news of a US stock drawdown and strong Brazilian exports in October.</p>
<p>The Rio de Janeiro Coffee Center said on Tuesday the country's exports for October already totalled a hefty 1.70 million 60-kg bags based on bills of lading.</p>
<p>Cocoa prices were just easier and sugar extended a technical decline.</p>
