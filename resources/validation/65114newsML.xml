<title>UK: Kevin Maxwell, dominated by father and his legacy.</title>
<headline>Kevin Maxwell, dominated by father and his legacy.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Kevin, Robert Maxwell's youngest son, had always dreamed of inheriting his father's empire and was regarded as a shrewd, cool and tough businessman.</p>
<p>But the dream and the wealth it brought carried a high price.</p>
<p>He was bullied by his father during Robert's lifetime and the media tycoon's legacy -- and ruined business empire -- has dominated Kevin's every waking hour following Robert's mysterious death at sea in November 1991.</p>
<p>Kevin, 37, twice faced fraud-related charges but left court on Thursday with his name cleared.</p>
<p>In January he and his brother Ian were found not guilty of conspiring to defraud Maxwell group pension funds after an eight-month trial.</p>
<p>On Thursday Kevin was told he would not have to face a second trial on charges of dishonestly using shares in a language company, Berlitz International, as collateral for loans.</p>
<p>A London High Court judge said he had decided to halt proceedings on the grounds that they &quot;would be unfair, so unfair as to amount to an abuse of power of the court&quot;.</p>
<p>Kevin's ability was evident when, at the age of only 32, he was appointed chairman of Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC), Robert's flagship.</p>
<p>He was a calm foil to his bombastic, explosive father -- a strategist while Robert enjoyed nothing more than making deals.</p>
<p>&quot;Dad was a legend in his own lifetime. There are very few of them and I think the myths surrounding him will continue to grow for many years,&quot; Kevin once said.</p>
<p>Tall and thin, Kevin acted and looked nothing like his heavily built, larger-than-life father. But since he was a young boy, Kevin had aspired to follow in Robert Maxwell's footsteps.</p>
<p>&quot;My childhood ambition from the age of 12 was to work with dad,&quot; he testified during his first fraud trial. &quot;I was in awe of him as a child and I was very frightened of him.&quot;</p>
<p>During his lifetime Robert Maxwell trusted Kevin enough to put him in charge of several of the family businesses including the New York Daily News newspaper and the Oxford United soccer club in England.</p>
<p>&quot;Kevin was and is a finance man,&quot; a defence lawyer told the trial.</p>
<p>Peter Laister, a former non-executive director of MCC and a seasoned corporate chairman, described Kevin as &quot;one of the most able young executives&quot; he had ever met.</p>
<p>Witnesses at the trial said Kevin had basically taken over running his father's businesses by 1991, as Robert Maxwell eased away from corporate matters and sought new status as a statesman.</p>
<p>Bankers, accountants, auditors and lawyers said Robert maintained corporate power, but Kevin ran the day-to-day business and was their senior point of contact.</p>
<p>Kevin, Paris-born and Oxford educated, had his first real job in the family business in 1980 as a copy writer in the marketing and sales department of one of his father's companies.</p>
<p>In 1983 he was sent to the United States to launch a military and defence business but the enterprise ended badly.</p>
<p>&quot;It finished with essentially my being fired by my father because he objected to my marriage to Pandora,&quot; Kevin said, referring to his wife and the mother of his five children.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1984 he was asked to return to the family fold and accepted. From 1985-1987 he was responsible for the publishing business.</p>
<p>&quot;It was akin to being on a rocket,&quot; he said. &quot;It was tremendous, rapid expansion and growth at a tremendous scale and at a tremendous speed.&quot;</p>
<p>Kevin said his father, whom he described as a bully, used pension funds just like any other assets in his corporate empire -- as a source of cash to move from one company to another whenever he deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Robert Maxwell was the decision maker and risk taker, Kevin said, while he and his brother did what they were told.</p>
<p>&quot;Ultimately the decisions were taken by him. Our role was to implement the decisions that he gave us to deal with.&quot;</p>
<p>Witnesses at the trial agreed that Robert Maxwell was a domineering character, but they suggested Kevin also had some power and was far from timid.</p>
<p>Robert's body was found floating in the Atlantic in November 1991.</p>
<p>Kevin became Britain's biggest bankrupt in 1992 with debts of 406.8 million pounds ($616.1 million at current rates), after he lost a lawsuit filed by liquidators who were trying to recover missing pension funds.</p>
<p>He was released from bankruptcy in 1995.</p>
