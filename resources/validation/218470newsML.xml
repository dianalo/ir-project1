<p>The level of the lira's return to Europe's exchange rate mechanism (ERM) sets the basis for &quot;loyal competition,&quot; French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis was quoted on Tuesday as saying.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Stampa, he also said France had been instrumental in achieving the Italian currency's return to the ERM grid in tough talks over the weekend among European Union finance ministers in Brussels.</p>
<p>But he added that the lira's re-entry after a four-year absence was not in itself enough to ensure Italy would be among founding members of the EU's planned single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>The decision to let the lira back into the ERM at a central rate of 990 per mark followed years of sniping by Paris that Italy had benefitted from a &quot;competitive devaluation&quot; when its currency was forced out of the ERM in a 1992 currency crisis.</p>
<p>Italy had held out over the weekend for a 1,000 lire per mark rate but was ultimately forced to compromise in the face of German resistance, according to official sources.</p>
<p>Arthuis said the lira had appreciated by 25 percent over the past 18 months. &quot;Such progress lays the basis in our opinion for loyal competition,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said France had had no objection to a 1,000 lire per mark rate and had proposed the compromise outcome.</p>
<p>&quot;Paris employed its good offices to obtain a general consensus on 990. The operation was crowned with success, as can be seen,&quot; Arthuis said.</p>
<p>Asked about Italian membership of the euro, Arthuis said &quot;I don't think there is anything to prejudice an Italian presence among the partners who will enter the euro on January 1 1999. But there are other conditions to satisfy before we can say we're definitely there.&quot;</p>
<p>He said much would depend on the success of Italy's 1997 budget, which aims to slash 62.5 trillion lire from next year's deficit to come close to the three percent deficit to gross domestic product ratio required for euro membership.</p>
