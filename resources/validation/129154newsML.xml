<p>A Hong Kong air rescue team was trying to airlift 24 crew from a vessel south of the colony on Sunday after the ship developed engine trouble, government radio said.</p>
<p>The rescuers in two helicopters were carrying out the airlift co-ordinated by the Marine Department to ferry the crew on board Equator Pearl 110 nautical miles south of Hong Kong to a nearby vessel, the government said in a statement.</p>
<p>A department spokesman said by telephone the rescue was still progressing at 0715 GMT and it was not known how many people had been removed from the vessel.</p>
<p>The helicopters had been sent to the scene at 0530 GMT, the statement said.</p>
<p>The department received a report from the captain saying that the ship had engine trouble, the statement said.</p>
<p>The department deployed a fixed-wing aircraft from the Government Flying Service to the scene and alerted ships in the area to help. The vessel was later located by the aircraft.</p>
<p>About an hour later, the captain decided to abandon the ship because of rough seas, the statement said.</p>
