<p>Japan's third biggest brokerage, Nikko Securities Co Ltd, said on Friday that it was not optimistic about achieving its earnings forecast for the current business year ending in March.</p>
<p>Nikko executive vice president Masao Yuki, speaking in an interview with Reuters, cited falling stock prices as the reason for his lack of optimism on earnings.  </p>
<p>&quot;While we have two more months before the end of the current business year, we cannot be optimistic (about the target),&quot; he said. &quot;It is becoming difficult to achieve the figures which we revised (last December) because (monthly) earnings have not reached the level that we had anticipated since December.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said that the abolition of Japan's securities transaction tax, as urged by some politicians and officials, would help Japan's stock market, which has been stuck recently in a downward spiral on fears about the economy.</p>
<p>Yuki also said that &quot;Big Bang&quot; reforms aimed at liberalising Japan's financial markets by 2001 will trigger a kind of &quot;survival contest&quot; whose winners will remain in the market.</p>
<p>&quot;(To be a winner) we must cut costs and raise the efficiency of all types of assets,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Yuki said that the most important issue for Nikko before the Big Bang reforms was how to cut total personnel costs but raise payments to talented young workers with a bright future ahead of them, without hurting morale.</p>
<p>Last December Nikko revised its earnings forecast for the year to March 31 downward to a parent current profit of 40 billion yen from a previous forecast of 60 billion yen.</p>
<p>At the same time it said it expects a net loss of 95 billion yen compared with the previous forecast of a net profit of 24 billion yen because it decided to post an extraordinary loss of 147.5 billion yen in order to provide financial aid to troubled financial affiliates.  </p>
<p>Yuki said, however, that the impact of falling stock prices would be less harsh for securities companies than for the banking industry.</p>
<p>If the Nikkei share average falls to the 17,000 level and stays there, the banks would have trouble achieving their problem loan write-off plans, he said.</p>
<p>Nikko's Yuki also said that banks are keen to sell shares in securities houses with which they have no close business ties, and such unwinding of cross-shareholdings would continue.</p>
