<p>The Papua New Guinea government has warned the World Bank that it is prepared to forego the remainder of the bank's US$345 million aid programme if conditions attached to the funding prove too onerous.</p>
<p>Outlining the government's budget agenda for calendar 1997, Finance Minister Chris Haiveta told parliament in Port Moresby on Tuesday night the government could survive without the second tranche of the loans-for-reform programme.  </p>
<p>The programme is coordinated by the World Bank and comprises funding from the bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Japan and Australia. The aid, of which US$200 million has already been paid, is conditional on economic reform.</p>
<p>&quot;The IMF and the World Bank are invited to join and assist us. We have done all we could to satisfy their requirements. I am calling on them to cooperate with us,&quot; Haiveta said.</p>
<p>&quot;If they do, we will be very pleased and honoured but they must appreciate that we will not compromise our rights as a sovereign independent nation and people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If they don't, we will got it alone,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>World Bank officials were in Port Moresby in recent days for more talks on the programme, but left without a resolution.</p>
<p>The aid has been held up mainly by the bank's concern over a recent government move to bring the independent National Forest Authority under the forest minister's control.</p>
<p>Some experts believe logging in Papua New Guinea is being carried out at twice the sustainable rate.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Haiveta told Reuters by telephone that the prospects for an agreement with the bank was slim and that the bank must make the next move.  </p>
<p>&quot;They will breach their own agreement if they don't come good (with the second tranche),&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Asked about the prospects of agreement, he added: &quot;Not good, in the sense that both sides are not giving any ground. We would like them to respect our independence. This is the message we are trying to get across to them.&quot;</p>
