<headline>Judge orders Prudential document destruction probe.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-18</dateline>

<p>A U.S. district judge said he wanted additional information about the destruction of documents at a Prudential Insurance Co of America sales office in Massachusetts before deciding whether to impose sanctions.</p>
<p>U.S. district judge Alfred Wolin in Newark, N.J., ordered Melvyn Weiss, one of the attorney's representing policyholders in the class action against Prudential, to conduct the investigation and issue a report to the court by December 27.</p>
<p>Wolin said the court will then &quot;very promptly&quot; issue an opinion on the request that sanctions be imposed on Prudential.  </p>
<p>Prudential on Monday said it had discovered the document destruction during a routine compliance examination of its Cambridge, Mass., office.</p>
<p>Prudential said it has dismissed John Breedlove, the managing director of the office, and called the document destruction deplorable and a clear violation of the company's policy.</p>
<p>This incident follows several other document destruction incidents.  Prudential in August fired a senior vice president for failing to enforce company directives about preserving documents.  </p>
<p>Policyholder attorneys are concerned about the destruction of documents because they could be relevant to policyholder claims in the class action against Prudential for improper sales practices.</p>
<p>Policyholders must decide by December 19 whether to participate in the proposed class action settlement.</p>
<p>A hearing on the fairness of the proposed settlement is scheduled for January 21.</p>
<p>In that settlement, Prudential agreed to pay at least $410 million to settle lawsuits by policyholders claiming they were victims of deceptive sales practices.</p>
<p>Prudential earlier in the year also agreed to pay a record $35 million fine and reimburse customers nationwide as part of a separate multi-state settlement.</p>
