<title>ECUADOR: New Ecuador's president is a skilful negotiator.</title>
<headline>New Ecuador's president is a skilful negotiator.</headline>
<dateline>QUITO, Ecuador 1997-02-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Fabian Alarcon, voted Ecuador's 41st president on Tuesday, is a politician known for sharp negotiating skills.</p>
<p>Congress voted by an overwhelming 57-2 majority, with five abstentions and one blank vote, to appoint him interim president, for the second time in a week. He is set to rule until Aug. 10, 1998, and hand over to a president to be elected early next year.</p>
<p>The 49-year-old head of Congress was not long ago a staunch ally of ousted leader Abdala Bucaram. He was even considered as Bucaram's possible running mate for last year's general elections.</p>
<p>Alarcon accompanied Bucaram during the campaign, standing firmly by his side while the eccentric populist insulted political opponents or belted out pop tunes.</p>
<p>Yet, he did not hesitate last week to urge 4,000 demonstrators to take the Carondelet presidential palace by force as Bucaram defied a growing chorus of calls for his removal.</p>
<p>Alarcon, the leader of the small centre-right Alfarist Radical Front, twice held the post of Congress president and was vice- president in charge in 1995 when then vice-president Alberto Dahik fled the country after being accused of corruption.</p>
<p>His party holds only three seats in the 82-member Congress.</p>
<p>Bucaram supporters accused Alacorn of being a spineless, opportunistic politician who reneged on his former ally to grab the presidency.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is not loyal to a friend will not be loyal to the country,&quot; pro-Bucaram lawmaker Marco Proano said last week.</p>
<p>Critics at Congress nicknamed him &quot;the dancer&quot; for his apparent turncoat ability to support whoever is in power.</p>
<p>A graduate in political science from Quito Catholic University, Alarcon was born on April 14, 1947, in Quito. He is married to Lucia Pena Ochoa. They have three children.</p>
