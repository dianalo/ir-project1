<p>A man screaming about devil worshippers rammed his Jeep up several flights of stairs leading into the Canadian parliament on Friday before he stopped and was overcome by police.</p>
<p>Police said the man gunned his Jeep past the Centennial Flame at the entrance to the parliamentary grounds up a paved walkway and up to the front door of Parliament's main building. He narrowly missed a worker sweeping up cigarettes.</p>
<p>The driver jumped out of his Quebec vehicle and stormed into the lobby of Parliament, shouting and thrashing about. It took several minutes and 20 to 30 security officers to overpower him, said a politician who had been at the door.</p>
<p>&quot;He was like a wild tiger. His legs were going, kicking the police in the stomach and everywhere. Finally they put a plastic band around his legs,&quot; said Member of Parliament Eugene Bellemare, who had been waiting for a couple school groups.</p>
<p>&quot;The yelling was infernal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He was finally forced into a police car, repeatedly shouting in English, &quot;Devil worshipers, devil worshipers,&quot; then he managed to kick out a window in a back door of the police cruiser.</p>
<p>&quot;It was as if he had gone berserk,&quot; Bellemare said.</p>
<p>The blue Jeep was stuck inside a covered walkway leading to the center door of the stone parliament building, before finally being hauled off on a flatbed truck. Rusty chunks from the undercarriage were strewn across the stairs.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps said the incident was likely to cause a security review, possibly to ban general vehicle traffic around Parliament, but other politicians said it would be a pity to put more distance between them and the public.</p>
