<p>Oil storage operators in Singapore are adding new long-term capacity, but weak demand and lower fees have already forced one independent player to curb expansion plans, industry sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sources said Oiltanking Singapore Ltd has an option on a piece of land to build additional storage but does not plan to proceed with plans to expand its 600,000 cubic metre terminal by 200,000 cubic metres.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no plans to expand,&quot; said a source.</p>
<p>The managing director of Oiltanking was not available for comment.</p>
<p>Tough times ahead were signalled last year, when major oil companies like Mobil and Esso and French oil company Elf failed to renew term leases.</p>
<p>Singapore's storage capacity for petroleum products was around 2.215 million cubic metres, but occupation may be as low as 70 percent, of which 65 percent is leased on long term contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;A very small amount is being leased out on spot (short term),&quot; said an terminal manager.</p>
<p>It did not make sense to store oil in a backwardated market, where nearby prices are more expensive than later prices, sources said, because it can be more profitable to sell now than later.</p>
<p>&quot;In this kind of market where you have a backwardation, any one who stores is not doing the right thing,&quot; said a trader. &quot;If any one does, it is because he does not have a choice.&quot;</p>
<p>Sources said storage has been mainly sought for gasoline becauswe Asia region has excess supplies and for jet-kerosene fuel, the only product in contango - where outer month cargoes are more expensive than near term cargoes - as heating demand for raises prices for the colder winter months.</p>
<p>&quot;But even for winter stockpiling, the contango now is not big enough to justify the storage fees,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Although storage fees in Singapore have in the past year come down by around a dollar to around S$5 per cubic metre a month (US$7.05), traders said they were still almost double the rates in the U.S. and Europe and needed to come down further to become economically viable.</p>
<p>&quot;If they drop prices, there will be demand for the new capacity coming onstream,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>But Singapore's two other independent storage operators were optimistic for the future.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of us are bullish about regional demand and anticipate big trading,&quot; said Tay Thian Chye, a terminal manager at Dutch-owned Van Ommeren Tank Terminal.</p>
<p>The Asia-Pacific region's annual oil consumption growth is the highest in the world at around 5 percent, which is projected to continue to 2010 when it will exceed a quarter of world energy demand.</p>
<p>&quot;We are just contributing to the infrastructure for the future growth in the oil industry, as Singapore is a centre of trading activity,&quot; said Keith Pereira, manager at Tankstore Ltd.</p>
<p>Tankstore's new 110,000 cubic metres storage, expected to be ready by October 1, will bring the company total capacity in Singapore up to 930,000 cubic metres, he said.</p>
<p>Tankstore is a joint venture between GATX Terminal Corp and Dutch Paktank Group, owned by Royal Pakhoed .</p>
<p>Van Ommeren is continuing with plans to add 174,000 cubic metres of storage by around April 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;New storage terminals, especially in China will be competition for Singapore operators as they have the advantage of being close to the consumer markets. But traders can break bulk here,&quot; said a trader in Singapore. &quot;It depends on your strategy. Let's just say the storage business is not having a boomtime, but it is not in dire straits.&quot;</p>
