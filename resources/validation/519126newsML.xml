<p>Cambodia's exiled Prince Norodom Sirivudh hoped to go to China if forced to leave Hong Kong after failing to fly home to fight charges of plotting to kill co-Premier Hun Sen, a source close to the case said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government would not allow the prince, who arrived on Tuesday, to stay in the territory for more than two days, the source said, asking not to be identified. &quot;(The prince) should leave in the evening, some time today,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government declined to provide an immediate comment on the development.</p>
<p>Sirivudh was trying to extend his permit to stay in Hong Kong and was also working on travel arrangements to fly to Beijing if he had to leave the British colony, the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sirivudh has already been in touch with China and is waiting for a reply,&quot; he said. China has often played host and mediator to the leaders of Cambodia's battling factions.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Dragonair refused to allow Sirivudh on its flight to Phnom Penh on Tuesday, and Royal Air Cambodge also barred the prince from flying, after Phnom Penh said he would be arrested on arrival, raising fears about passenger safety.</p>
<p>Sirivudh's aide Tanaka Khloth said by telephone from a hotel where the prince spent Wednesday night the airlines' refusals left the prince stuck in his attempt to return home via Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;So we have no alternative way to do it any more now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sirivudh checked out from that hotel on Thursday and his whereabouts were not known.</p>
<p>Khloth said the prince had switched hotels on Wednesday partly because of concerns about his security. But he said he believed it was safe for the prince to be in the British-ruled territory. &quot;I don't see any trouble here,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While in Hong Kong, Sirivudh has said he will persist in efforts to go home and seek a fair trial.</p>
<p>Sirivudh said Co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh and the royalist FUNCINPEC party supported his return. &quot;So I hope that we'll get protection. I don't want to create any confrontation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A half-brother of King Norodom Sihanouk and a former foreign minister, Sirivudh went into exile in December 1995 after being held for one month on charges of involvement in an alleged plot against the life of Hun Sen.</p>
<p>Hun Sen, who rules in an uneasy coalition with the FUNCINPEC party of Sirivudh's nephew Ranariddh, has refused to back calls for an amnesty and warned last week of violence if the prince returned. Last December Hun Sen said he would shoot down any plane carrying Sirivudh.</p>
<p>Sirivudh said in Hong Kong he did not think he would be killed when he arrived in Cambodia. &quot;I believe in our institutions. We have a monarchy, we have a king, we have a national assembly, we have a royal government.&quot;</p>
