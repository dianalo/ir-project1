<title>SINGAPORE: S'pore changes tax treatment of some CPF accounts.</title>
<headline>S'pore changes tax treatment of some CPF accounts.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-07-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Singapore Finance Minister Richard Hu said on Friday employers' contributions to some accounts under the government's Central Provident Fund (CPF) compulsory savings scheme would no longer be tax free from 1999.</p>
<p>Hu said in the city-state's 1997 budget speech that this change would apply to CPF accounts -- such as those for foreigners working in Singapore -- which were paid voluntarily or only because of clauses in contracts of employment.</p>
<p>&quot;I have decided to rationalise the tax treatment such that all CPF contributions made voluntarily or obligatarily under contracts of employment will no longer be tax deductable for both the employer and the employee,&quot; he told parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;Further the employer's contributions will be taxable as income in the hands of the employee. As a concession the new tax treatment will take effect from January 1, 1999.&quot;  </p>
<p>Under existing CPF arrangements, employees and employers both pay the equivalent of 20 percent of the employee's gross salary into the CPF, which is managed by a government body.</p>
<p>The tax free CPF money is used for pensions, to pay medical bills or for housing purchases.</p>
<p>The scheme is compulsory for Singaporeans working at home but is voluntary for foreigners working in Singapore.</p>
<p>Foreigners can remove the whole of the CPF contributions when they eventually leave Singapore.</p>
