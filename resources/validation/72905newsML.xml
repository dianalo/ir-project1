<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday left interest rates unchanged at a policy meeting closely watched by world financial markets.  </p>
<p>The decision, which had been anxiously awaited on Wall Street and at the White House, left the key federal funds rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans unchanged at 5-1/4 percent. It also left unchanged the discount rate, which the Fed charges banks, which remained at 5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 1:40 p.m. (1740 GMT),&quot; central bank spokesman Joseph Coyne said. &quot;There is no further announcement.&quot;</p>
<p>The bland statement hid what analysts believed was one of the more contentious meetings of the policy-making committee. Anti-inflation hawks at the Fed, particularly at its regional banks, have made no secret of their desire for higher rates to cool off the economy and head off inflation.</p>
<p>Tuesday's decision was good news for President Bill Clinton, who has been counting on a trouble-free economy in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election to help him win a second, four-year term.</p>
