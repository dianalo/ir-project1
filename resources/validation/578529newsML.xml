<p>British Airways and American Airlines are expected to seize on an announcement by rivals due on Wednesday to argue that while a regulatory headwind is holding back their own alliance others are allowed to get ahead in the race to create global networks.</p>
<p>United Airlines and its German ally Lufthansa are due to announce in Frankfurt a consolidation of their existing alliances with Thai Airways, United Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines and Air Canada.</p>
<p>An airline source confirmed that the grouping will now be called the &quot;Star Alliance&quot;, to open opportunities for common branding in marketing and advertising, although combining routes through code-sharing might continue to be restricted by bilateral aviation accords.</p>
<p>The Lufthansa-United tie-up obtained immunity from US anti-trust laws before the BA-American deal was floated, and BA has always cited this as a precedent for why it should be allowed to link up with American.</p>
<p>BA and American argue that they must be allowed to compete against rival alliances for important transfer traffic in what they say is becoming an increasingly global market.</p>
<p>According to industry sources, United had reservations about launching the Star Alliance while regulators in the U.S. and Europe were still deliberating on the BA-American deal, but decided it could not wait for ever.</p>
<p>On June 11 it will be a year since BA and American first announced their alliance, but the deal is still enmeshed in a complex web of regulatory processes.</p>
<p>Firstly, BA and American have yet to agree satisfactory terms with Britain's Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which must then make its recommendations to the new trade and industry minister Margaret Beckett.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still waiting for the OFT to come back with its advice,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Beckett's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).</p>
<p>But any concessions to be agreed with the OFT are also critical to shaping the British negotiating position at open skies aviation trade talks with the U.S., so it is still far from clear when a decision might emerge.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still in discussions with the OFT,&quot; said a spokesman for BA. &quot;Getting the right deal done is the most important factor, not the timing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. has made approval of the alliance conditional on Britain and the U.S. agreeing to liberalise the transatlantic air travel market.</p>
<p>But to complicate the issue further the alliance is also being examined by the European Commission.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Brussels is talking to Whitehall, Whitehall is talking to Washington and Washington is talking to Brussels,&quot; said an official with one airline.</p>
<p>The industry does not expect open skies talks to resume for some weeks yet, to give Labour's deputy prime minister and head of transport, John Prescott, and his aviaton minister, Glenda Jackson time to decide policy.</p>
<p>&quot;We never expected new open skies talks before June and we may now be looking beyond that unless they have some sort of holding round where the civil servants get together,&quot; said one source with a U.S. carrier.</p>
<p>But Labour is moving fast and BA confirmed reports that its chief executive Robert Ayling already met with Prescott on Thursday last week to outline the issues.</p>
<p>The BA and American tie-up has attracted widespread criticism from rival airlines, including United, as well as consumer groups, alleging that the deal would monopolise transatlantic air services out of London's Heathrow airport.</p>
<p>But Labour officials have said they would take a pragmatic approach, treating the competition issues in the context of the open skies talks. Under the proposed alliance BA intends to co-ordinate its 244 flights a week to 22 U.S. destinations with American's 238 flights from seven U.S. airports to 12 European destinations.</p>
<p>BA and American argue that their deal will lead to greater competition because an open skies deal would allow all U.S. airlines access to compete at Heathrow, Europe's most important transatlantic landfall.</p>
