<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-07-01</dateline>

<p>Dutch shares closed firmer on Tuesday, with market players somewhat reassured by U.S. economic data released toward the end of the session.</p>
<p>The main share index, the AEX, opened up some eight points at 870.21, and held on to most of its gains throughout the day, closing 9.76 points higher at 871.31 points.</p>
<p>With little company news available, market players speculated on the possible outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting starting after the AEX closed.</p>
<p>&quot;The entire market is just waiting for the FOMC to give a hint on the direction,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Half an hour before close, the U.S. NAPM index over June - below expectations - was released, giving Dutch shares an extra push. The index stood at 55.7 in June versus a forecast 56.4 and 57.1 in May. Leading indicators were up 0.3 percent in May, against a forecast 0.2 percent rise.</p>
<p>&quot;A couple of index heavyweights have kept the market up in relatively modest volume the whole session,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Royal Dutch, whose shares were split on a 1-for-4 basis on Monday, added 4.30 guilders to end at 106.70.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been known for quite some time, yet I think the effect of the split will be felt for some more time,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Unilever, which announced the sale of canned foods firm John West Foods on Monday, added 10.10 guilders to 423.30.</p>
<p>Philips ended down 3.40 guilders at 137.20, but dealers could not find a particular reason for the drop.</p>
<p>&quot;All good things have to come to an end one day,&quot; one dealer said, referring to the stock's recent gains.</p>
<p>Philips reached a year high of 144.00 on June 27, after starting the year at 67.90 guilders.</p>
<p>Heineken gained 8.00 guilders to 343.00.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just coming back from Monday's 16.70 guilders drop,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers played down market speculation speculation that brewer Grolsch was a takeover target.</p>
<p>&quot;When the market quietens, the flow of rumours gets noisier,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;We have lots of time to chat.&quot;</p>
<p>Grolsch said it was not currently in talks about a takeover of its business and had no plans to start such discussions soon.</p>
<p>&quot;They may say they're not holding talks on it, but that doesn't mean there won't be a bid,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Another argued the brewer's protective structure made a hostile bid quite unlikely. &quot;Dutch companies are all impregnable fortresses, and Grolsch is no exception,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bourse-listed Grolsch shares carry no voting rights.</p>
<p>Grolsch ended 0.20 guilders lower at 67.90 guilders.</p>
<p>Dealers said they believed the Dutch stock market would remain calm, but added the overall sentiment was still rather positive.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if the Fed does raise rates, the market will pick up soon enough, since fear of a hike will have disappeared...And it looks like the summer season has started,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
