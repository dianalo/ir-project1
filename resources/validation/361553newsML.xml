<headline>German DAX ends firm, chemical sector supports.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-02-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Germany's DAX index of 30 leading shares posted modest gains on Thursday as selective interest in the chemical sector continued and the Bundesbank's decision to leave rates unchanged matched expectations.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX rose 6.14 points to end the bourse session at 3,104.14 points.</p>
<p>But prices were lower than the close of after-bourse screen trading on Wednesday, during which shares staged a mini-rally on early Wall Street gains, which were later reversed.</p>
<p>&quot;All in all this is a consolidation,&quot; said one dealer, who said he expected little movement through the rest of the day.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no concerted push upward but the dollar is still over 1.65 and that is still a positive.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar was buoyed by a report showing a sharp rise in German jobless data in January, when unemployment hit 4.66 million -- the highest level since the 1930s.</p>
<p>The chemical sector was ahead for the second day in a row, with the DAX-100 chemical sector index up 0.6 percent, rising three times faster than the top 100 shares. Dealers say chemicals are catching up now after lagging the DAX for months.</p>
<p>The engineering sector was even more in demand after better-than-expected year-end earnings from Preussag AG and a decision to hold its dividend at 12 marks, countering some market fears that the payout would be cut.</p>
<p>After an initial surge which flagged as trading continued, Preussag ended floor dealings up three marks at 391.</p>
<p>Engineering group Mannesmann rose 14.50 marks to 658 after Merrill Lynch raised the stock to a &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;neutral&quot; and, according to dealers, raised its target price for the stock significantly.</p>
<p>Software group SAP's preferred shares slipped 4.70 marks to 249.80 after a placement at 244 marks of some 3.54 million common shares once held by SAP's co-founder Hans-Werner Hector, who resigned in late 1996.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank's largely-expected decision to leave interest rates unchanged had minimal impact on the market.</p>
<p>Dealers generally see no immediate impetus for a move on rates and one noted: &quot;With this kind of jobless rate, we can more or less rule out a rate hike.&quot;</p>
