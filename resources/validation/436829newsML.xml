<p>Employers and trade union officials in Germany's huge metal and engineering sector said on Wednesday they wanted an accord that could allow millions of workers to retire early.</p>
<p>The consensus emerged at a first round of talks aimed at overhauling the collective wage bargaining system that the sector, along with most of German industry, has relied on for most of the post-war era.</p>
<p>&quot;Both sides want to secure contractual agreements on pre-retirement working conditions,&quot; Werner Stumpfe, speaking for the employers, told journalists after the talks in a hotel in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>One aim of such an agreement would be to create more employment opportunities in an industry which lost more than 100,000 jobs a month last yeazr as firms relocated abroad or reduced capacity.</p>
<p>IG Metall, Germany's largest trade union with some three million members, said earlier it saw agreements allowing early retirment in the sector as an &quot;absolute priority&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Young workers must be given a possibility of employment in the sector and old workers must be allowed to move into retirement under acceptable circumstances,&quot; its chairman said.</p>
<p>IG Metall said it had proposed a model that would allow workers effectively to retire five years early while retaining their full pension entitlements.</p>
<p>Under the scheme, 55-year-old workers would receive 85 percent of their full salary for the last 10 years of their working life. They would then work full-time for five years before being released at the age of 60.</p>
<p>Pension contributions would continue to be paid in full for the last 10 years under the plan, which the union says has the support of the Bonn government.</p>
<p>But Gesamtmetall's Stumpfe said the scheme as it stood was too expensive. A working group of union and employer representatives would look into the issue in more detail before a new meeting scheduled for April 13.</p>
<p>A total of about 4.7 million Germans are now out of work and the collective wage bargaining system that appeared to serve Germany well during the so-called &quot;economic miracle&quot; following the war has come under growing criticism.</p>
<p>Employers in particular argue that sector-wide agreements are too inflexible and do not now work for many firms, particularly small ones and those in relatively new fields such as information technology.</p>
<p>Gesamtmetall wants to have &quot;exemption clauses&quot; built in to collective wage agreements that would, for example, more easily allow companies to save costs by operating at reduced staffing levels when business was slack.</p>
<p>IG Metall opposes such clauses, but has indicated it would be ready to accept so-called &quot;hardship&quot; clauses now used in east German contracts under which, under certain circumstances, firms can reduce wages for a limited period.</p>
<p>A wide-ranging reform of the wage bargaining system is not expected before the end of the year.</p>
