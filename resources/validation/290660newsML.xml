<p>Most Croatian stocks forged ahead on rising volume and turnover on Tuesday, and analysts said growing demand could push prices higher still in the month ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;People are usually eager to invest the money they still have after New Year holidays,&quot; said Velimir Zelimorski of Fima brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;But the question is how many 'big guys' are in the game,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He predicted brisker trade until early February, but could not foresee any bull run similar to the one that swept the market in October.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope to see some real growth for stocks this year...that is that their value is based on the quality of the firm,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Six of ten issues that traded on Tuesday rose, two fell and two were flat.</p>
<p>Volume rose to 12,032 units, turnover was three times higher at 7 million kuna.</p>
<p>Top gainer Zagrebacka Banka jumped 130 kuna to 1,200 with 3,448 units sold. Zelimorski said Zagrebacka was the safest bet on the Zagreb bourse as it proved to be the most stable stock. Its 1/10 GDRs traded at $22.625 each on Seaq International.</p>
<p>The bank was closely followed by chocolate maker Kras which added 40 kuna to close at 540, trading 450 shares.</p>
<p>Most active drugs firm Pliva edged up ten kuna to its all time high of 415 kuna on volume of 5,777 shares. Its shares were split 1/37 on January 1. Its GDRs, now representing 1/5 of each share, traded at $15.55 in London on Tueasday.</p>
<p>Food processor Podravka gained five kuna to 235, with 421 units traded.</p>
<p>The only gainer among hoteliers, Suncani Hvar, inched up five kuna to 55 on volume of 1,005 shares.</p>
<p>Other four active hotel stocks either fell or remained flat. Top decliner Arena inched down two kuna to 140, selling 467 shares sold. Laguna lost 20 kuna to 1,050, with 21 units changing hands.</p>
<p>Istraturist and Jadranturist were stable at 142 and 250 shares, respectively.</p>
