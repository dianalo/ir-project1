<text>
<p>A taste for sharp suits, snappy one-liners and life at the top have made new Australian boss Terry Venables one of the more colourful characters in world soccer.</p>
<p>The first player to represent England at all five levels from schoolboy internationals up, Venables made his name as coach at Crystal Palace, Queen's Park Rangers, Barcelona, Tottenham Hotspur and finally with England.</p>
<p>With such a pedigree, it was never likely that he would settle for life solely as director of football at first division Portsmouth and on Tuesday the former England coach confirmed he had agreed to help guide Australia to the 1998 World Cup finals.</p>
<p>Now 53, Venables was ideally suited to the London of the swinging 60s when cockney accents and personalities were the height of fashion.</p>
<p>A talented schoolboy footballer who honed his skills on the streets outside his parents' council house, Venables also enjoyed fleeting success as an entrepreneur, nightclub singer and writer.</p>
<p>Aged only 17, Venables devised the perfect answer for a non-existent problem with the Thingummywig, a combination of wig and hat which women could wear over their curlers when they went shopping.</p>
<p>With no recorded demand for his product, Venables then persuaded some friends to invest in a Soho tailoring business.</p>
<p>&quot;We ended up the best dressed paupers in London,&quot; one of his erstwhile partners recalled ruefully.</p>
<p>A partnership with author Gordon Williams on a series of novels featuring a streetwise London private eye James Hazell was more successful.</p>
<p>Venables revealed a flair for Damon Runyon type dialogue and the series was later a successful television production.</p>
<p>He was also a fair singer who performed with the Joe Loss Orchestra at Hammersmith Palais and years later unblushing warbled &quot;My Way&quot; on live Spanish television.</p>
<p>Venables's off-field activities were not always so harmonious and contributed to his decision to announce he would quit the England job no matter how his team performed in this year's European championships because of a number of forthcoming court cases.</p>
<p>He has an enduring quarrel with Tottenham chief executive Alan Sugar, faced two television investigations into his business activities and was the subject of allegations that he had paid former Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough a bribe for one of his players.</p>
<p>Persuasive, articulate and personable, Venables always seemed destined for a career in soccer management.</p>
<p>He took Crystal Palace from the third division to the first in three years and swept Barcelona to the Spanish league title in the first of three years with the Catalan club back in 1985.</p>
<p>Over a heady summer month this year Venables took his England side to the semifinals of Euro 96 and into the hearts of the English public.</p>
<p>Now he takes on a cosmopolitan Australian side,  currently quoted at 150-1 to win the World Cup but practically assured of a place in France.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have liked to have gone to the World Cup and now  I have the possibility of this happening,&quot; Venables said on Tuesday. &quot;I have had much bigger offers in England but this wasn't just about the money.&quot;</p>
