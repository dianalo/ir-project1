<p>A majority white jury was sworn in on Thursday in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, but almost immediately the proceedings were brought to a halt when a problem arose apparently involving one black juror.</p>
<p>&quot;The jury was seated, it's still a 12-person jury. Right now we're having jury problems,&quot; court spokeswoman Jerrianne Hayslett told reporters.</p>
<p>Attorneys said the problem might delay the start of opening arguments set for Tuesday. Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki told prospective alternate jurors: &quot;We've developed a slight problem at this point.&quot;</p>
<p>He later dismissed them for the day and was expected to address the juror problem on Friday.</p>
<p>The juror involved was apparently a black man in his 40s who during earlier questioning had said he believed Simpson had been framed in the murders of the former football star's ex-wife and her friend.</p>
<p>Asked about the allegation that Los Angeles police had planted evidence to frame Simpson, the juror said: &quot;I believe somebody made a mistake, it was a coverup.&quot;</p>
<p>The juror also told the court he had been the victim of domestic abuse, an issue which was central to the criminal case against Simpson.</p>
<p>He said on Thursday he &quot;was hit at least three times by women.&quot;</p>
<p>In earlier questioning, the man said: &quot;Neither of my wives would ever say I jumped on them ... both of them jumped on me.&quot;</p>
<p>Following almost a month of questioning of more than 200 potential jurors, Judge Fujisaki had earlier seated the 12- person panel, with whites making up the largest proportion.</p>
<p>The jury consisted of seven whites, two blacks, one Hispanic and another of mixed white and Hispanic heritage and one born in Jamaica who is part Asian and part black. Seven are women and five men.</p>
<p>Simpson, who was acquitted by a predominantly black jury at a criminal trial last year of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown and a friend, Ronald Goldman, was in court on Thursday for the culmination of a process to choose the jury that will decide his fate. He has been sued by the families of the victims and if found responsible for the murders could be forced to pay millions of dollars in damages.</p>
<p>The racial makeup of the jury could be crucial as opinion polls since the criminal trial have consistently showed an America divided over the verdict, with most blacks believing in Simpson's innocence and the majority of whites thinking he got away with murder. Simpson is black; the victims were white.</p>
