<headline>LIFFE white sugar hoists its way back from lows.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>White sugar futures picked up from earlier lows in routine Thursday activity with light trade buying supporting nearby values, market sources said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the session, commission house players crossed the Dec/Mar spread but interest dwindled later in the day and some outright trades were seen in both nearby positions, they said.</p>
<p>December saw some 300 lots against actuals trades by one leading commission house, while European buyers were noted in the second-month March contract. &quot;There's nothing really very important going on,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>At 1615GMT December stood $1.10 firmer at $323.10 and March also up by that margin at $320.20. Volume was 1,620 lots, dominated by the two front contracts.</p>
<p>December managed to hold above the $321.00 low notched up during Wednesday's session but technical analysts said the price outlook was bearish as support at $320.00 was under pressure.</p>
<p>Trading was thin in Paris where volume totalled 203 lots.</p>
<p>December was 50 cents higher at $322.00 and March unchanged at $319.50.</p>
