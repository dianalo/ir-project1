<p>Grain futures continued to drop on the Budapest Commodity Exchange (BCE) on Tuesday, with the March milling wheat plummeting 1,170 forints per tonne as excess stocks hit the market, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was continuous trade at this level and a relatively high turnover,&quot; said Gabor Herczeg of LaSalle.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, March delivery milling wheat futures prices were exempt of the daily 400 forints movement range.</p>
<p>According to BCE rules, if a maturity drops five consecutive days by the daily allowed maximum of 400 forints, on the sixth day the limit is removed until the daily drop again becomes smaller than 400 forints.</p>
<p>March milling wheat ended at 25,840 forints and Herczeg said it could fall further.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that the May maturity dropped by limit could indicate further drops for March as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The BCE said other grains futures are just one limit-down day away from free fall.</p>
<p>&quot;The limit on May, August, September, October and December milling wheat as well as December feed maize would also be removed if the limit-down drop continues on Wednesday,&quot; said BCE spokesman Peter Janoska.</p>
<p>Traders were not surprised by the drop as maize and wheat surplus was bound to appear on the market as producers have to sell in order to finance spring farm works.</p>
<p>&quot;Sellers have appeared with sizeable volumes on offer, probably realising their earlier expectations (of higher prices) were wrong,&quot; Herczeg said.</p>
<p>Turnover was  a solid 2,287 contracts or 899.67 million forints, of which maize accounted for 1,395 contracts and milling wheat for 686.</p>
<p>Lot size is 20,000 kgs for all contracts.</p>
<p>($=169.95 Hungarian forints)</p>
