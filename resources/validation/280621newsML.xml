<title>USA: CBOT soybeans end down on expected sales, weather.</title>
<headline>CBOT soybeans end down on expected sales, weather.</headline>

<p>CBOT soybean futures ended near session lows, under pressure from an anticipated jump in farmer sales and good weather in South America, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The (South American) weather is very bearish for corn and beans,&quot; said Victor Lespinasse, vice president with Dean Witter brokerage in Chicago.</p>
<p>Both Argentina and Brazil continued to have warm weather with periodic rains, which should help boost the size of those country's soybean crops, traders said.</p>
<p>Speculators were also sellers of futures in anticipation of a wave of fresh farmer sales after the new year, traders said.</p>
<p>The market also fell on ideas that demand for soybean meal as hog feed would fall after the government forecast a smaller-than-expected U.S. hog herd on Friday.</p>
<p>Weekly USDA soybean export inspections of 25 million bushels was seen as moderately supportive to the market. Traders had been looking for exports ranging from 25 to 30 million bushels.</p>
<p>Soybeans ended down 3-1/4 to nine per bushel, with January down 7-1/4 at $6.94-1/4 and March down 6-1/4 at $6.90-1/2.</p>
