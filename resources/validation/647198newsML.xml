<p>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Monday he had &quot;serious concerns&quot; about an $85 billion Republican tax cut plan, saying it tended to take tax benefits away from poorer people and give them to the wealthy.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of problems that are going to need some serious attention,&quot; Rubin told reporters in the first comment by the Clinton administration on proposals unveiled earlier Monday by Rep. Bill Archer, influential chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee that writes tax legislation.  </p>
<p>Rubin said Archer's tax program &quot;seems to have to have moved the tax benefit away from the less well off, and even away from middle income people, toward higher income people.&quot;</p>
<p>Archer, a Texas Republican, earlier on Monday laid out the details of how he planned to write legislation implementing the May 2 balanced-budget deal between Democratic President Bill Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress.</p>
<p>Although Rubin was careful not to accuse the Republican of reneging on the agreement, he suggested in some ways Archer's program did not live up to the deal, saying some elements were &quot;not consistent with the agreement with respect to education.&quot;</p>
<p>Although the thrust of his remarks was critical, Rubin also struck a conciliatory note, saying &quot;our objective is to work with Congress to get a bill.&quot;</p>
