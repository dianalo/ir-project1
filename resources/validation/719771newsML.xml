<p>Italian shares closed mostly lower on Thursday as the bourse paused for breath and investors took some profits after the leaps and bounds of recent days.</p>
<p>The all-share Mibtel index finished 0.48 percent lower at 13,828 with the blue chip Mib30 closing 0.6 percent down at 21,029. Turnover dropped to 1.588 trillion lire from 2.164 trillion lire on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Fiat shares took a hammering late in the day as traders dumped the stock which closed 2.33 percent lower at 6,255 lire.</p>
<p>&quot;They shot down Fiat like a big elephant,&quot; said a Milan stockbroker. The stock has gained in recent weeks, boosted by a surge in domestic car sales on the back of a government incentive scheme.</p>
<p>The FIB30 contract held up well at 21,150, indicating strong underpinning to the market, while bond futures, which also retreated, were well supported, the September BTP LIFFE contract closing at 136.24.</p>
<p>Credito Italiano showed no sign of running out of steam among the banks, gaining 2.92 percent to 3,740 lire. although most other banks eased.</p>
