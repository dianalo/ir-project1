<p>Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo said on Monday they unanimously decided to suspend normal ties with Israel because of what Syrian minister Farouq al-Shara called the Jewish state's &quot;clumsy and stupid&quot; anti-peace policy.</p>
<p>The ministers agreed on Sunday night to recommend that their countries suspend normal ties with the Jewish state, restore the economic boycott, close down Israeli missions and withdraw from multilateral peace talks. They met again on Monday.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Arab states of ganging up on Israel but called the notion that they could revive the Arab boycott &quot;absurd&quot;.</p>
<p>Shara told reporters at the end of the ministers morning session: &quot;This resolution has been issued unanimously. All the ministers who spoke, including Morocco and Oman, said they support the essence of the resolution.</p>
<p>&quot;The resolution is very wise because it is aimed at saving the peace process and affirms the commitment of Arabs to peace. It says that peace cannot be achieved unless occupied Arab land is returned. Peace for peace cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>&quot;Netanyahu's policies have forced Arab countries to take such a decision,&quot; Shara said. &quot;Arabs have taken a wise decision in response to a clumsy and stupid policy.&quot;</p>
<p>The Arab League has not yet released the final text of the resolutions but, as described by some of the ministers, they are the most decisive concerted action the Arabs have taken since Netanyahu took power last June.</p>
<p>The effect will be somewhat diluted because states which have formal agreements with Israel -- Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians -- are not required to enforce the resolutions.</p>
<p>Arab anger came to a head when Israeli bulldozers broke ground at a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem on March 18.</p>
<p>Palestinians throwing stones have clashed with Israeli troops in the West Bank and Gaza since then and talks between Israel and the Palestinians are close to collapse.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said on Monday Arabs should not revert to threats whenever their relations with Israel were strained.</p>
<p>&quot;What is required on the Arab side is to recognise that we are not always going to have agreement with Israel but that we don't go back to this mode of 'ganging up' on Israel and making these absurd ideas that the boycott will be reinstated,&quot; Netanyahu told Israel Radio's English news.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel has known periods of Israel-bashing more than once and we've been able to overcome it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Farouk Kaddoumi, the hardline head of the PLO's political (foreign affairs) department, said the Israeli premier was trying to wipe out Palestinians.</p>
<p>&quot;Netanyahu should go to hell. I've said it several times. He is a hardliner. He thinks we (Palestinians) are Red Indians. I respect Red Indians. He comes from Brooklyn, from the United States. He thinks he can annihilate the Palestinians. Netanyahu is like Hitler.&quot;</p>
<p>The decision to halt steps towards normalisation with Israel was hailed as a victory by Syria and Lebanon, which have long urged other Arab states such as Oman, Qatar, Morocco and Tunisia not to rush towards setting up ties with the Jewish state.</p>
<p>&quot;From the beginning of the peace process we asked of our brotherly Arab countries not to rush into taking decisions that would precede the normal development of the peace process,&quot; Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bouez said.</p>
<p>&quot;We must choose -- either the peace process as agreed upon in Madrid and Israel must express a clear intention that it will abide by stopping its settlement policy and abide by the principle of land for peace, or that Israel does not want this process. In this case Arab countries cannot be committed to something Israel has destroyed,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah, whose country froze relations with Israel last week, blamed Israel for the Arab resolution.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister of Israel has closed the door to normalisation. Everyone is keen on keeping the track of peace going on. It is for the Israeli government to decide whether they want normalisation with Arabs or not,&quot; Alawi said.</p>
<p>&quot;If they want normalisation with other Arabs they should normalise relations with Palestinians as well,&quot; he said.</p>
