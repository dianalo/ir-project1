<p>Delhi shares closed lower on Thursday on heavy selling by domestic financial institutions who squared their positions ahead of the end of a settlement period, brokers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping did not affect the trade.</p>
<p>The bourse's benchmark index closed 5.53 points lower at 735.44.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think the trade was speculative in nature as most of the players were interested in squaring their positions before the close of the current settlement,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Friday is the last day of the current settlement period.</p>
<p>&quot;Increased selling by the domestic financial institutions dampened the market,&quot; said Suresh Aggarwal of brokers Jai Mata Securities.</p>
<p>Traders said market was expected to move in narrow ranges over the next few sessions.</p>
<p>&quot;Both buyers and sellers adopted a cautious approach and waited for the government to present the financial budget before staking out fresh claims,&quot; said another broker.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram is due to present the budget 1997/98 (April-March) on February 28.</p>
<p>Reliance Industries ended 3.70 rupees lower at 267.75 on profit-taking coupled with a slowdown in foreign buying, brokers said.</p>
<p>Bajaj Auto fell 14.0 rupees to 928 on selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), they said.</p>
<p>TISCO slipped 2.70 rupees to 190.20.</p>
<p>ITC closed 2.90 rupees lower at 413.0.</p>
<p>Larsen and Toubro shed 1.90 rupees to 240.70.</p>
