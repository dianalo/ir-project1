<p>Big Japanese manufacturers grew somewhat cheerier about their business prospects in November, according to a closely watched Bank of Japan survey released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan's quarterly corporate survey, or &quot;tankan,&quot; showed that the diffusion index for big manufacturers -- an important gauge of corporate sentiment -- rose to minus three in November from minus seven in August, when the previous survey was conducted. The tankan is a key clue to Japan's monetary policy.</p>
<p>The rise in the manufacturers' diffusion index to minus three had been forecast on average by private economists surveyed by Reuters, though it was still below the level of zero predicted by the firms themselves in August. The economists' forecasts had ranged from minus 10 to zero.</p>
<p>The index represents the percentage of firms expecting business to improve minus those who expect it to worsen. The higher the number, the more optimistic the outlook.</p>
<p>Major non-manufacturing companies also grew a bit more optimistic, with their diffusion index improving to zero from minus four for August. The firms had forecast a November index of minus three at the time of the last survey.</p>
<p>Economists had said, however, that even a modest improvement in corporate sentiment was unlikely to prompt the Bank of Japan to tighten interest rates, which it has kept at rock-bottom levels since September 1995, when the central bank slashed its official discount rate to a record low 0.5 percent.</p>
