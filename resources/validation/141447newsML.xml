<headline>Cost of UK VAT case hinges on new law - tax experts.</headline>

<p>Tax accountants said on Thursday the potential cost of value-added tax cases on discount vouchers could be in line with the Treasury's 200 million stg estimate, but only if a new &quot;three-year&quot; rule is upheld.</p>
<p>The three-year rule states that in these VAT cases, companies can only claim back excess VAT on the last three years of business. It is retrospective to July 18 and will be presented in the Finance Bill in November.</p>
<p>But one tax expert said companies are trying to challenge that ruling in Europe. </p>
<p>&quot;The Treasury is treating the three-year rule as if it were law already. But it is not rock solid,&quot; said Alan Buckett, VAT partner at Binder Hamlyn and President of the National VAT Practitioners Council.</p>
<p>If the rule is found to be contrary to EU law, the costs of Thursday's ruling will be a lot more. &quot;Without the three-year rule it will cost around 500 million stg,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The European Court upheld on Thursday a move by Unilever subsidiary Elida Faberge and retail chain Argos to have the British government pay back excess VAT paid on discounted goods.  </p>
<p>The European court said in such cases VAT was payable on the discounted and not the full price, a decision that could require substantial repayments to companies from the British government.</p>
<p>Richard Watson, head indirect tax partner at Price Waterhouse, agreed the Treasury's estimate was based on the three-year rule sticking.</p>
<p>&quot;The Treasury's 200 million stg estimate looks about right, but it is on the basis of the three-year rule and is certainly not taking into account a bigger time period than that.&quot;  </p>
<p>Thursday's ruling settles one of many outstanding VAT cases.</p>
<p>One pending but quite different case (not included in the Treasury's 200 million stg estimate) and with potentially more serious implications for government revenue covers company cars.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal recently refused to refer to the European Court a case brought by a host of companies arguing that UK law on business car VAT is at odds with EU law.</p>
<p>Under UK law, businesses buying company cars to lease are unable to claim back VAT on the deal.</p>
<p>The companies are due to take the case to the higher House of Lords.  </p>
<p>But so far the UK authorities have won legal backing for their view. &quot;The companies lost the case in the appeal court and the chances are the House of Lords will also find against them,&quot; said Buckett.</p>
<p>Tax experts said if the government were to lose that case -- which they now say is highly unlikely -- it could cost up to 25 billion stg.  </p>
<p>And another case which could dent public finances concerns VAT on interest-free credit deals.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Court of Appeal found in favour of retail companies who argued that they have overpaid VAT on interest free credit deals.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone thought that was a strange ruling at the time and the House of Lords may well find in favour of Customs &amp; Excise,&quot; said Buckett.</p>
<p>In court, Customs &amp; Excise said if they had to repay the VAT it would cost 5.0 billion stg.</p>
