<headline>Virginia Supreme Court hears budget veto dispute.</headline>
<dateline>RICHMOND, Va. 1996-09-10</dateline>

<p>Lawyers for Virginia Gov. George Allen told the state Supreme Court that the General Assembly prevented the governor from doing his job by sending him only revised portions of the 1994-96 budget, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>Catherine Hammond, deputy attorney general, said the legislature not only short-circuited the governor's veto powers but dodged a constitutional responsibility to fully air for taxpayers the contents of the budget.</p>
<p>&quot;The ultimate effect...is to erode the governor's authority,&quot; she told the justices in a hearing Monday.</p>
<p>Allen sued the General Assembly in May, alleging it blocked him from fully wielding his veto power by sending him only revised portions of the 1994-96 budget, not the whole thing. The assembly said it is not legally required to transmit the entire document when adopting amendments to an existing budget.</p>
<p>A ruling is expected Nov 1 and could tip the balance of power between the Democrat-dominated assembly and the Republican governor, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The assembly's lawyers, including A.E. Dick Howard, principal author of the modern Virginia Constitution, said sending Allen the entire amended budget would shift the state to an annual budget, ending its tradition of setting spending in two-year increments.</p>
<p>Howard said it was up to voters, not the Supreme Court, to expand the governor's veto, referring to Allen's claim that he can strike any written restrictions from the budget. State Supreme Court rulings in 1940 and 1976 confined such a veto to language directly tied to appropriations.</p>
<p>Justice A. Christian Compton, who aggressively questioned the assembly's lawyers, said the governor can't view amendments separately and must consider their impact on the entire budget.</p>
<p>&quot;How is a chief executive able to act in a meaningful way on an amendment...without the entire document before him?&quot; he said.</p>
