<p>Kmart Corp said Wednesday that continued high markdowns on women's apparel will hold its second quarter net income below its year-ago profit of $34 million, or $0.07 a share.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently, we expect that Kmart will report a profitable second quarter, but below last year's performance,&quot; Kmart Chairman Floyd Hall said in a statement accompanying the retailer's June sales results.  </p>
<p>Excluding the discontinued Builders Square unit, Kmart reported that its sales for the five-week period ended July 2 increased 3.5 percent over a year earlier to $3.142 billion with sales for stores open throughout both periods up 5.3 percent.</p>
<p>Hall said the overall sales were running as expected and showed progress in home fashions and seasonal areas, such as outdoor furniture, fans and air conditioners.  </p>
<p>&quot;While sales of women's apparel improved slightly during June, clearance markdowns continue to be significantly higher than plan,&quot; Hall said. &quot;As a result, Kmart's solid performance in other merchandise areas will be more than offset by margin erosion specifically tied to women's apparel.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that Kmart is disappointed with its poor performance in women's apparel and is taking steps to &quot;get it right in this critical area.&quot;</p>
<p>The company is actively searching for a new senior vice president of apparel and a divisional vice president for its women's wear business and expects to have both positions filled soon.</p>
<p>Stephen Ross, Kmart's apparel chief, left the comany in June as the result of a mutual agreement with top management following disappointing clothing sales.</p>
<p>Hall said Kmart's consumables business performed well in June, aided by the conversion of 118 additional stores to the new Big Kmart format, which feature large &quot;pantry&quot; sections of consumable items.</p>
