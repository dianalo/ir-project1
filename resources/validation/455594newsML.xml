<title>UK: Metals end mostly firmer, LME still ranging.</title>
<headline>Metals end mostly firmer, LME still ranging.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Base metal prices largely trended higher during Thursday LME trading, although the pace of business was mostly routine with prices generally rangebound, traders said.</p>
<p>Copper, which was successfully supported at $2,300 on Wednesday, consistently pushed higher but stalled at intermediate resistance around $2,350.</p>
<p>News that unions at Poland's KGHM were on strike alert was supportive, but did not over-exite the market which is still ranging between $2,320/30 and $2,380 on the upside.</p>
<p>At the end of the kerb three months prices were at $2,351.50, up $26.50 a tonne from Wednesday. The cash/threes backwardation widened to around $39/44, against $36.</p>
<p>Aluminium prices were firmer, partly helped by copper, but also bouyed by short-covering after Wednesday's support at $1,650.</p>
<p>The market was also helped by a headline drop in February IPAI daily production, although some analysts doubted the veracity of recent data which now includes Chinese figures.</p>
<p>Angus MacMillan of LME trader Billiton Metals Ltd noted that the IPAI data suggested that overall Asian production had fallen.</p>
<p>However, China's State Statistical Bureau said today that China production in Jan/Feb rose 23.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The implication is that IPAI production fell elsewhere in Asia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But output elsewhere in the region is being maintained, so the data that has been added this year to the IPAI is increasingly suspect.</p>
<p>By the close of the kerb prices were $16 steadier at $1,669 - well above the early low of $1,650.</p>
<p>Nickel prices perked up during the session, also helped by trends in copper, with the market edging back above $8,000. Last trade was at $8,040, up $55 from the previous kerb.</p>
<p>Lead and zinc were both steadier throughout the session although the former metal drifted back towards the lower end of the day's range on the kerb to close at $694, up just $3.</p>
<p>However, zinc remained reasonablly well supported above $1,300 and poised to test recent 4-1/2 year highs. The market closed at $1,305, up $9.</p>
<p>Tin bucked the trend, with the market swinging back into a contango after this week's backwardation proved short-lived. Last trade was at $6,025, down $10.</p>
<p>Alloy was quoted at a steadier $1,553/1,555 a tonne.</p>
