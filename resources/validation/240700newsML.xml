<p>October UK industrial production and manufacturing output data confirm the steady recovery in manufacturing but are unlikely to have a major impact on monetary policy, economists said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The data confirm evidence that a pick-up in the manufacturing sector has taken place and will continue as we look ahead,&quot; Deutsche Morgan Grenfell economist Ciaran Barr said.</p>
<p>&quot;But this doesn't change the picture for interest rates. Rates will go up next year anyway.&quot;  </p>
<p>October manufacturing output rose 0.5 percent, both month-on-month and year-on-year, slightly faster than the Reuters consensus forecast of 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>Industrial output, however, was flat on the month and grew 1.3 percent year-on-year, below the 1.6 percent consensus.</p>
<p>&quot;We shouldn't be concerned at all over the headline figure because it is all weather-related,&quot; Barr said. &quot;It will rebound in November, which was quite cold.&quot;</p>
<p>Richard Jeffrey of Charterhouse Tilney Securities Ltd said the official figures underestimated the strength of the economic recovery.  </p>
<p>&quot;The point is that, overall, the government's official series underestimates manufacturing output, a conclusion supported by the PMI figures,&quot; Jeffrey said.</p>
<p>The PMI index dipped to 54.4 percen in November from October's 54.5, reflecting an expansion in the manufacturing sector for the sixth consecutive month.</p>
<p>&quot;Manufacturing output is much in line with market expectations. I would expect significant revisions by half to one percent in the figures for the year,&quot; Jeffrey said.  </p>
<p>Robust consumer demand would force the government to raise interest rates next year, after it had gauged the strength of Christmas consumer spending, he added.</p>
<p>Bank of England Governor Eddie George on Thursday said there was no urgent need for a dramatic base rate increase, but short sterling futures still point to a rise of around 60 basis points from the present 6.0 percent by the end of March..</p>
<p>CIBC Wood Gundy economist David Coleman said the data painted a bright picture of the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>&quot;There are signs that the pick-up in consumer spending is finally starting to be reflected in higher output,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The pound's appreciation is one dark spot on the horizon, but a strong domestic economy should at least help cushion the impact.&quot;</p>
<p>Jonathan Loynes of HSBC Markets said the data pointed to tentative recovery, but warned that the government could not afford to take a strong economic revival for granted.</p>
<p>&quot;The pick-up is only fragile and a further rise in interest rates -- renewing the pound's appreciation -- could threaten to tip manufacturing back towards recession,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America said economic growth was strong enough to maintain pressure for a January rate rise.  </p>
<p>&quot;They do support the view that the inventory overhang that hit growth earlier in the year has now been largely addressed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise in sterling does not appear to have had a big effect, although subsequent gains in November may yet take the edge off future production.&quot;</p>
