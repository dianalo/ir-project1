<p>Cuba's cigar industry, which has received a boost from foreign financing, plans to increase cigar exports to 200 million in the year 2000, more than double the current level, an industry oficial said Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The prospects are very good,&quot; Manuel Garcia, vice president of the Cuban cigar selling company Habanos SA told a news conference in Havana.  </p>
<p>The export target for 1997 was for 100 million cigars. This would maintain a continuing trend of recovery for the Cuban industry, which exported more than 71 million cigars in 1996 compared with 55 million the previous year. Gross income from cigar exports last year totalled more than $100 million.</p>
<p>Garcia said financing provided by foreign buyers like Spain's Tabacalera had played a key role in boosting tobacco production and cigar exports over the last three seasons. Tabacalera provided annual financing of $28 million, covering 50 percent of the choice tobacco crop, to guarantee cigar deliveries to Spain, Cuba's biggest single market.  </p>
<p>Cuba's world-famous cigar industry suffered a slump in production after 1991 as a result of the recession triggered by the collapse of trade ties with the former Soviet Union. Essential inputs to the tobacco sector, such as fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, were temporarily disrupted.</p>
<p>Garcia said the Cuban cigar industry would continue to need foreign financing for the time being.</p>
<p>But Tabacalera had this year changed the structure of its relationship with the Cuban industry to avoid the effects of the U.S. Helms-Burton law, which seeks to curb foreign investment in communist-ruled Cuba.  </p>
<p>Instead of Tabacalera directly financing the Cuban crop, funds would now come from Spanish financial institutions, with the Spanish tobacco company acting as guarantor.</p>
<p>Garcia said that despite the increase in exports, Cuba still fell short of satisfying current world demand for Havana cigars. He estimated this at up to 125 million, excluding the U.S. market, where the longstanding U.S. economic embargo against Cuba bars the island from selling its cigars.</p>
<p>Cuba later this month will host a sales strategy meeting with the main international distributors of Havana cigars.</p>
