<p>Italy's cross-party reform commission completed work on Monday on re-writing the constitution and sent its recommendations to parliament where they are likely to be met with a barrage of amendments.</p>
<p>The commission, headed by Massimo D'Alema, leader of the largest party in the government coalition, the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), ended five months of often-heated deliberations with a simple vote on the planned reforms.</p>
<p>The package, which envisages a radical shake-up of Italy's little-loved electoral laws, was approved by a big majority. But several senior government and opposition supporters have already vowed to wage war on the proposals.</p>
<p>The 70-strong commission, which includes most party leaders, hopes that its suggestions will end the succession of revolving-door governments which have ruled Italy since World War Two.</p>
<p>&quot;Tonight we can say that the path towards reform has started and that the objective of changing our political system, which has been sought for so long, now seems definitely reachable,&quot; D'Alema told reporters.</p>
<p>The recommendations centre on plans for a directly-elected president with powers over defence and foreign affairs, replacing the present largely ceremonial post.</p>
<p>A prime minister, chosen by the ruling coalition, would decide domestic affairs, two new-look assemblies would be elected under a complex voting system and more power would be devolved to the regions.</p>
<p>Deputies have until the end of July to put forward amendaments fdor consideration by the reform commission. The package is not expected to reach the full houses of parliament for debate until early 1998.</p>
<p>A text would have to be approved twice by both houses before it would be put to a referendum.</p>
<p>D'Alema managed to reach a deal with the leader of the centre-right opposition bloc, Silvio Berlusconi, over the package, but the accord infuriated many government supporters.</p>
<p>&quot;We are only at the beginning, but what has been done here is not good news,&quot; said Fausto Bertinotti, head of the hard-left Communist Refoundation, which secures Prime Minister Romano Prodi's majority in the lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>Refoundation fiercely opposes the creation of a directly- elected president, arguing that such a figure could develop into a dictator.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and Telecommunications Minister Antonio Maccanico have said they will join forces to overturn some of the commission's work.</p>
<p>&quot;This reform is absolutely insufficent and inadequate,&quot; Dini said at the weekend. He said the new voting system would continue to create huge, disparate coalitions, while the new presidential position has not been given sufficient powers.</p>
<p>Former foreign minister Antonio Martino, a Berlusconi ally, said: &quot;This electoral law will give birth to broad-based coalitions incapable of governing...and a popularly-elected president with next to no powers.&quot;</p>
