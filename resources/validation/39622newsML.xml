<headline>BA denies report of 10,000 imminent job cuts.</headline>

<p>British Airways (BA) denied on Monday a newspaper report that it planned to slash at least 10,000 jobs and brushed off a report that it wanted to hive off operations so it could focus on flying aircraft and dealing face-to-face with customers.</p>
<p>The Independent newspaper said that under &quot;secret proposals,&quot; 10,000 workers would lose their jobs and a raft of BA operations, including baggage and cargo handling, engineering and maintenance and information technology, could be sold off.  </p>
<p>A BA spokesman said he had been surprised at the report, which was based on the company's plans -- announced earlier this year -- to save 1.0 billion stg over the next three years.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a surprise that they've put a figure on something (job cuts) where we have made no decision,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>BA said in May that it planned to deliver business efficiencies worth one billion stg by 2000 when it reported record annual pretax profits of 585 million pounds.  </p>
<p>The company has also stated that every aspect of its operations was under review to achieve this goal, including commercial, operational and overhead activities.</p>
<p>&quot;At this stage, we are looking at all options available to us,&quot; the spokesman added. &quot;We are looking at all aspects of the business. This is what we've previously made public...But we've reached no conclusions whatsoever about how many, if any, jobs will be affected.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Independent quoted company sources as saying that a new strategy, dubbed &quot;Step Change&quot; by senior managers, would probably mean the sale of the baggage and cargo-handling functions, crew support operations and other activities.</p>
<p>&quot;...the strategy will mean that, within the next four years, BA will simply fly aircraft and provide the face-to-face contact with customers. &quot;All the rest will be sold or split away from the main company as part of management's plan to slash costs...,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Trade union leaders had already asked senior BA directors for a meeting this week, the newspaper added.</p>
<p>The BA spokesman said he knew nothing of a union request for a meeting, saying only that unions had been kept &quot;abreast of this subject all along.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking ahead while we are still profitable,&quot; he stated. &quot;You cannot stand still or you overheads would exceed your profitability at some stage. We're looking at the business, seeing where efficiencies can be made...&quot;</p>
