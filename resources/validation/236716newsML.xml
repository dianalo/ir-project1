<p>A strike by more than 80,000 miners in Russia's Siberian Kemerovo region entered its third day on Thursday but many workers started feeling their protest against wage delays was not impressing the Kremlin.</p>
<p>A spokesman for local Citizens' Defence Committee, a public body set up by striking miners, said 42 coal pits and two open-cast mines were on strike. There are 76 pits and 25 open- cast mines in Kemerovo, Russia's major coal-producing region.</p>
<p>The spokesman said that, apart from 80,000 miners and workers of associated local factories, more than 10,000 teachers, who face similar problems, had also joined the protest.</p>
<p>Almost 400,000 miners across Russia launched the nationwide strike on Tuesday demanding that the government be replaced and that Moscow pay long overdue wages.</p>
<p>Union leaders say the government owes miners at least 1.5 trillion roubles ($270 million). Consumers owe miners another eight trillion roubles.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as saying on Thursday the government had allocated 750 billion roubles on December 3 to cover the arrears and would pay 450 billion roubles more in the nearest future.</p>
<p>The miners say they have not seen the money.</p>
<p>But as unions, industry managers and government negotiate to end the crisis, many people in Kemerovo, hit by freezing weather, are beginning to feel their protest is generally ignored and they themselves are probably the only sufferers from the strike.</p>
<p>Only about 100 people gathered on Kemerovo's central square to show support for the strike in the minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4F) frost that struck the city overnight.</p>
<p>Most left quickly after waiting in vain for the local governor to turn up.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone feels cold,&quot; said Nadezhda Udilova, who works at a local chemical plant and who had not been paid since August. &quot;No one from the administration came to talk to us, they simply do not consider us human beings.&quot;</p>
<p>Viktor Bunin, chairman of the local union, said the strike was virtually doomed when most open-cast mines, which produce more than 50 percent of coal in the region, refused to join it.</p>
<p>&quot;They support us morally but they do not want to ruin their mines and deprive people of heating,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kemerovo open-cast mines still manage to make ends meet while most other pits lose money. Some had been shut well ahead of the strike, which makes it difficult to estimate the real power of the protest.</p>
<p>Bunin also said Kemerovo remained one of few Russian regions where coal, rather than natural gas, is used for heating.</p>
<p>&quot;The strike is hurting people here more than anywhere else,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>This sad truth makes many people pessimistic about continuing the strike for any length of time.</p>
<p>&quot;We will soon go back to work,&quot; said Zoya Tishanskaya, one of those who had turned up at central Kemerovo square. &quot;They tell us that we are free to leave, and we do not want to lose our jobs.&quot; ($1=5522 Rouble)</p>
