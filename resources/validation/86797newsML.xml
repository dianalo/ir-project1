<p>Only three firms took delivery of cash Japanese government bonds against the September JGB futures, while 47 firms delivered the cash bonds, Tokyo Stock Exchange data obtained by Reuters showed on Monday.</p>
<p>Many dealers said hedge funds received up to 1.8 trillion yen, mainly through CS First Boston Ltd, out of the 2.34 trillion yen open interest at the September expiry.</p>
<p>Dealers said the September contract and the cheapest JGBs deliverable against it, namely the 161st and the 163rd JGBs, had been a target of severe short-squeezing by hedge funds in the period around the contract's settlement on September 20.  </p>
<p>U.S. hedge funds had huge long positions in September futures, while they were heavily borrowing the cheapest cash JGBs at the same time, dealers said.</p>
<p>Nearly the full amount of the 161st 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) was delivered against the September JGB futures, the data showed.</p>
<p>The data showed 947 billion yen worth of the 161st JGBs was delivered against the September contract, compared to their issue amount of 986 billion yen.  </p>
<p>At the expiry, open interest of the September contract was the largest ever for a benchmark contract at 2.3404 trillion yen, the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) said.</p>
<p>The data also showed 805.8 billion yen worth of the 163rd JGBs, out of their issue amount of 980 billion yen, was used for delivery.</p>
<p>The rest was delivered with 489.5 billion yen worth of the 164rd JGBs, 98 billion yen worth of the 166th and 100 million yen worth of the 170th.</p>
