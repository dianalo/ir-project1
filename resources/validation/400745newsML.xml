<p>An ethnic Albanian was tortured before he died in police custody in Serbia's troubled Kosovo province, a European Parliament factfinding delegation said on Tuesday after seeing his body.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen the tortured boy who died and who was given back yesterday morning to his family. Don't forget that at the end of the 20th century there is torture in your country and it cannot be accepted,&quot; Doris Pack, a German member of the European People's Party, told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen the body of this tortured young man. His fingers, nails and ear were injured. His legs were completely smashed and his feet were blue and green, it was dreadful. I've never seen anything like it,&quot; she told German radio later.</p>
<p>Besnik Restelica was arrested with scores of other ethnic Albanians in January in Kosovo, an Albanian majority region in Serbia, on suspicion of &quot;terrorist&quot; activities.</p>
<p>Serbian police told his father on Sunday that he had hanged himself with two T-shirts tied to a bed in his cell.</p>
<p>But the leading ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), said Restelica had &quot;died a violent death, arguably of tortures at the hands of Serb security&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The family showed us the body, from the feet to the ears. If you hang you must have some signs, you wouldn't have signs on only one side (of the neck). I can tell you it was only here (she pointed to one side of her neck) and not the whole neck. He was tortured and he died,&quot; Pack said.</p>
<p>The LDK statement said: &quot;Restelica is the sixth Albanian to have died of Serbian police hand so far this year.&quot;</p>
<p>The pro-government daily Vecernje Novosti said the &quot;tragedy has been politicised to a maximum by Albanian propaganda&quot; alleging Serb repression of Albanians, which it said disregarded the facts.</p>
<p>In 1989, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic abolished the autonomous status of impoverished Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one, on the grounds that its Albanians were preparing to secede from Serbia.</p>
<p>Nationalist Serbs say Kosovo is the ancient cradle of their culture.</p>
<p>The province has been widely seen as a powder keg that could destroy international peace efforts in the Balkans.</p>
<p>&quot;What we saw in Kosovo is very much a situation that could explode at any time and it is our opinion, and we told both sides, the Albanian and Serb side, that there must be an immediate start to dialogue,&quot; said Johannes Swoboda, Austrian member of the Party of European Socialists.</p>
<p>He said Kosovo would in coming years be the main issue on which Europe and the United States judged the situation in Serbia.</p>
<p>Swoboda said the European Parliament members had held productive talks with the three leaders of Serbia's opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition.</p>
<p>&quot;All three of them are ready for fruitful and open talks with the Albanian side and I think Europe will press for dialogue.&quot;</p>
<p>Pack said the delegation would recommend to the European Commission that no financial aid be given to Serbia until it made progress on human rights. Yugoslavia is still barred from international financial institutions.</p>
<p>She said this included the right of every Serb citizen to have access to free, independent media.</p>
