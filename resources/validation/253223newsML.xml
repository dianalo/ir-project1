<title>USA: Burnett in running for another airline account.</title>

<p>Leo Burnett Co., the advertising giant which two months ago lost its longtime client United Airlines in a bitter agency shootout, is now in the running for another major airline's marketing business.</p>
<p>Delta Air Lines put its estimated $100 million advertising account, held by Omnicom's BBDO for 51 years, up for review Tuesday just four weeks after former United Airlines marketing executive Gayle Bock joined</p>
<p>The scenario is hauntingly familiar to the plight of Leo Burnett Co., which lost the United Airlines business in a split decision with Fallon McElligott, Minneapolis, and Young &amp; Rubicam, New York, in October. The $120 million assignment followed a knock-down, drag-out ad review that also left TBWA Chiat/Day in the dust.</p>
<p>Burnett, creator of United's &quot;Come fly our friendly skies&quot; theme and the airline's trademark use of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, had a 31-year flight with United Airlines, a unit of Chicago-based UAL Corp.</p>
<p>As with the Delta contest, the United review followed a change in the marketing department -- the appointment of Michael Howe as director-advertising and promotion, after the retirement in June of John Ruhaak, United's vice president-advertising and promotion for 22 years and a former Burnett veteran.</p>
<p>Now, the tables may be turning for Burnett, which among a host of other agencies, including BBDO, WPP Plc's Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Interpublic Group's Ammirati Puris; N.W. Ayer, Wieden &amp; Kennedy; Cordiant Plc's Bates USA; Messner Vetere; Hal Riney &amp; Partners and WPP's J. Walter Thompson Co., is in contention for the account.</p>
<p>Erin Flynn, Delta's manager of corporate communications, said the only restrictions for the review were that a participating agency didn't have competing airline business, had the capability to handle global business and had a presence in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Burnett, which has an office in Atlanta servicing Coca-Cola Co.'s Fruitopia and Minute-Maid accounts, made a vow when it lost the United business not to let the agency's airline know-how go to waste.</p>
