<p>British insurance group Norwich Union on Monday played down Labour Party warnings of a major expansion in the use of private health insurance with National Health Service (NHS) trusts.</p>
<p>&quot;The NHS Trust Confederation has been talking to a number of insurers to develop dedicated insurance products for NHS pay-beds,&quot; said a Norwich spokeswoman.</p>
<p>&quot;We are on the record as saying we are one of the people that have spoken to them but as far as we are concerned the discussions are still ongoing and as far as we know the confederation has not reached a decision.&quot;</p>
<p>Norwich Union said there was nothing new in the Labour party claims and that the talks had been been public knowledge for some time.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had a trust care product since 1993, which provides private medical treatment in NHS pay-beds. Our trust care product which already exists is similar to the sort of deal the NHS Trust Confederation is looking at,&quot; said the spokeswoman.</p>
<p>At a morning press conference Labour leader Tony Blair warned that plans had already been developed between NHS Trusts and Norwich Union for a major expansion in the use of private health insurance &quot;as part of the two-tier NHS&quot;.</p>
<p>Labour released NHS Trust Confederation documents which discuss the opportunities for a commercial alliance with a medical insurance company to introduce a new insurance product based on increasing the use made of NHS private units.</p>
<p>There are currently around 80 NHS pay-bed units with some 1400 beds.</p>
<p>According to the documents four companies were invited to discuss proposals.</p>
