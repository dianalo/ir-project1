<title>USA: Guilty plea on forgery in U.S securities license scam.</title>
<headline>Guilty plea on forgery in U.S securities license scam.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>One of the men at the centre of the biggest securities licensing scam in Wall Street history, in which stockbrokers paid to have someone else take their tests, pleaded guilty to forgery in the second degree Monday, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Robert Idzi, 27, of Pleasantville, New York, was charged in a 108-count indictment with taking 20 separate tests for 15 brokers in Tennessee, Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and New York. In a deal worked out with prosecutors, Idzi pleaded to the one count of forgery.</p>
<p>He faces up to six years in state prison and about a $20,000 fine when sentenced April 28, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Another phony test-taker, Igor Shechtman, 36, of Encino, California, is also expected to plead guilty Wednesday before Manhattan State Supreme Court Justice Edward McLaughlin.</p>
<p>Idzi made no other comment to the judge other than his guilty plea on the forgery charge.</p>
<p>Evidence uncovered during the 2-1/2-year investigation revealed that the indicted brokers paid imposters up to $5,000 or were promised future shares of commissions in exchange for taking tests for them between 1993 and 1995, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Brokers must pass a series of licensing examinations administered by the NASD at its 56 centres nationwide before they can sell securities to investors.</p>
<p>In January more than 50 stockbrokers were accused by the Manhattan District Attorney of paying imposters to take the six-hour test administered by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD).</p>
<p>Last month 30 brokers struck a plea bargain with prosecutors to avoid prison sentences. They were given fines ranging from $5,000 to $20,000.</p>
<p>Also pleading guilty to forgery charges last week was Peter Latourette, an accused middleman who allegedly got payments for matching test takers with prospective brokers. On Monday three more brokers, Nicholas Sepe, Chance Miglino and Frank Pellegrino, also pleaded guilty to forgery and attempted forgery charges.</p>
<p>They faced up to four years in prison on those charges but instead will pay fines ranging from $2,000 to $5,000.</p>
<p>All of the defendants who have pleaded guilty have agreed to lifetime disbarment from the NASD and will be prohibited from trading in New York State.</p>
<p>Most of the men indicted in the scandal worked at 17 small and medium-size brokerage firms including Stratton Oakmont, Hanover Sterling &amp; Co. and Gruntal &amp; Co.</p>
