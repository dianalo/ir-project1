<p>As New York City officials neared an accord on the fiscal year 1998 budget, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday that he was close to a compromise with the City Council over its proposal for job-inducing tax cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there are always grounds for a compromise, and I think we have one,&quot; Giuliani said when asked about the tax break, one of the sticking points in the budget negotiations. &quot;But let's wait until the end of the day or tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>City Council officials said they expected an agreement on the budget, which takes effect July 1, to be announced Wednesday. City officials are looking at June 10 as day a budget accord could be completed.</p>
<p>Giuliani had earlier resisted Council Speaker Peter Vallone's proposal to grant $40 million in tax breaks to &quot;emerging&quot;  industries such as software development and biotechnology. But officials said he was willing to accept a broader plan aimed at spurring jobs.</p>
<p>Officials involved in the negotiations said the mayor also was prepared to accept a City Council proposal to reduce the unincorporated business tax (UBT) by offering credit against the personal income tax. The officials said the mayor was willing to accept a figure close to the $75 million UBT reduction the City Council had proposed. --U.S. Municipal Desk, 212-859-1650</p>
