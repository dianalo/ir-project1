<title>UK: Britons against Charles remarrying and being king.</title>
<headline>Britons against Charles remarrying and being king.</headline>

<p>Two-thirds of Britons who took part in a television poll said Prince Charles should not become king if he marries his mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles.</p>
<p>In the BBC poll for the programme &quot;You Decide&quot; on Tuesday, 67 percent of the 100,000 Britons who participated said no when asked if he should remarry and assume the crown.</p>
<p>The poll was the first test of public opinion since Prince Charles hosted a lavish 50th birthday party on Friday for his long-time love.</p>
<p>Charles' gala champagne celebration for Parker Bowles and about 100 guests was an unprecedented declaration of commitment to the woman he has secretly loved for 25 years.</p>
<p>Aware of the public hostility against her since his acrimonious divorce from Princess Diana last year, Charles and his mistress have kept a low public profile, taking care to avoid being photographed together.</p>
<p>The party was seen as the latest move in a discreet campaign to improve his lover's image and convince the British people that she is a permanent fixture in his life.</p>
<p>At 48, Charles is still waiting for Queen Elizabeth, now 71 and showing no signs of flagging, to allow him to take on the role of king for which he has been groomed since birth.</p>
