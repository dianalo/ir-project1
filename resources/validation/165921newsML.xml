<p>Funeral home operator The Loewen Group Inc is expected to announce a hefty increase in third-quarter operating profits on Thursday although analysts said costs related to its battle against hostile bidder Service Corp Intrnational could trim net earnings.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts on average anticipate Loewen will report earnings per share of US$0.30, estimate service IBES said. This would be up from US$0.20 a share in the third quarter of 1995 after extraordinary costs related to a lawsuit in Mississippi that reduced earnings by three cents a share.  </p>
<p>A Loewen spokesman declined to comment on the estimates but said the company has told analysts to expect Q3 earnings per share growth of about 25 percent over the prior year.</p>
<p>While most investors have focused on Service's US$2.9 billion bid for Loewen, &quot;the underlying business is doing quite well,&quot; said one analyst who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>But analysts said net earnings might be reduced by one to two cents a share by costs related to Loewen's fight against the Service bid. &quot;It's going to depend on what they do about the legal expenses associated with the hostile takeover,&quot; said analyst Susan Little of Raymond James and Associates.  </p>
<p>She forecast those expenses at US$1.5 million in the third quarter which would equate to US$0.015 a share. &quot;Fundamentally, excluding the hostile takeover (costs), they will probably do US$0.30,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Another analyst, who declined to be identified, said he forecast earnings of US$0.24 a share but expected takeover-related costs to be minimal in the third quarter. Service's bid was announced on September 17.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think they will put anything through in the third quarter. I think mostly it will be charged in the fourth quarter,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>But other analysts said Loewen, which has boasted of its strong growth prospects in its campaign to remain independent, was unlikely to resist the temptation to tie expenses to the special circumstances of the hostile bid. Loewen has waged an effort to cut costs and reduce overhead this year.</p>
<p>Those analysts compared the situation to Loewen's 1995 fourth-quarter earnings report. The company's earnings then were reduced by US$165 million in settlements for lawsuits, US$19.9 million in litigation finance costs and US$13.1 million in &quot;additional litigation and other expenses&quot; that it included in general administration.  </p>
<p>&quot;We never really knew exactly what went into that number,&quot; said one analyst of the last category. &quot;I think they took advantage of the unusual situation with the lawsuit and put a lot of stuff (costs) in there.&quot;</p>
