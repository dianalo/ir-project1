<headline>Post-Sumitomo scrap industry faces shake up - Alpert.</headline>

<p>The upheaval caused by the Sumitomo copper scandal and continuing pressures on profit margins will prompt further rounds of mergers in the scrap metal industry, said Estelle Wrisley of U.S. scrap trading company, Alpert &amp; Alpert Iron &amp; Metal.</p>
<p>The scrap industry faced challenges such as tighter Chinese regulations on imports, the Basel Convention rules, financial institutions &quot;causing problems&quot; on the London Metal Exchange, which is a reference for scrap pricing, and copper scandals.</p>
<p>A new Chinese rule was introduced earlier this month that requires all cargo destined for China to be inspected prior to leaving its country of origin, Wrisley said.</p>
<p>&quot;This process puts such a gridlock on doing business that is makes it nearly impossible to trade with China,&quot;  Wrisley said in a prepared presentation to the International Trade Club of Southern California in Long Beach.</p>
<p>&quot;This new regulation also burdens the steamship companies who receive revenue from this business,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The Sumitomo scandal, not long after Codelco's copper debacle, has forced many scrap companies to reassess their participation in copper trading and develop risk management policies, Wrisley said.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand that in some cases, a few companies are even fighting for their very existence due to the Sumitomo debacle.&quot;</p>
<p>Fierce competition has lead to margins at most scrap metal recycling companies being among the lowest of any industry, with only large tonnages enabling them to survive.</p>
<p>Wrisley said the &quot;catch 22&quot; was ocean freight charges - if they were lower, more scrap would be exported and U.S. material would be more competitive internationally.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, the freight differences themselves become the actual profit margin,&quot; Wrisley said.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the intense competition and rising processing costs, I believe that more consolidation and mergers will take place in the future.&quot;</p>
<p>She suggested scrap merchants could team up with the steamship companies.</p>
