<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin urged both sides in the Belarus crisis to show restraint on Tuesday, saying this was a precondition for further integration between the two Slav states.</p>
<p>&quot;President Boris Yeltsin considers civic accord and prevention of violence an absolute priority,&quot; Yeltsin's press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a Kremlin briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;He expects both sides to show restraint and adopt a balanced approach, believing that this is a key condition for a success in Russian-Belarussian integration.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin sent Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to negotiate a compromise between hardline Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko and his parliamentary opponents over a referendum aimed at boosting Lukashenko's powers.</p>
<p>But a deal signed last Friday, hailed by Yeltsin as a huge success for Russian diplomacy, collapsed in less than 24 hours and Lukashenko pressed on with the referendum despite international criticism.</p>
<p>On Monday he announced an overwhelming victory in the poll, which allows him to dissolve parliament and call elections if the legislature resists his actions.</p>
<p>Parliamentary speaker Semyon Sharetsky called the vote a &quot;farce&quot; and the constitutional court was due to meet to consider impeaching Lukashenko.</p>
<p>The United States expressed disappointment on Monday at Lukashenko's decision to go ahead with the referendum and said his victory was &quot;deprived of legitimacy&quot;.</p>
<p>Commenting on the U.S. statement, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Tarasov, quoted by Interfax news agency, said it was for the Belarussians themselves to decide whether to acknowledge the results of their referendum.</p>
<p>Speaking at a news briefing, Tarasov said Moscow was concerned that the agreement it had helped broker in Minsk had not been fulfilled.</p>
<p>&quot;We can see the real path to compromise in the realisation of the agreement between parliament and the president that has already been signed,&quot; Interfax quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Moscow favours Lukashenko's quest for closer ties with Russia but fears his autocratic style and lack of free-market economic reforms could prove a burden in the two-state union agreed by Yeltsin and the Belarus president last April.</p>
