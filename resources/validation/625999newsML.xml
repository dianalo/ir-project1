<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Britain's leading blue chip index closed sharply lower as plunging U.S. stocks and uncertainty over the EMU took their toll, dealers and strategists said. The FTSE 100 share index ended down 51.0 points at 4,621.3, a fall of 40.5 from a week ago, as decliners broadly beat advancers 76 to 21.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German shares took a tumble during floor trade in Frankfurt on Friday, falling nearly 2.5 percent after a big sell-off. Lower Bunds cited as a factor and dealers said uncertainty in the wake of the Waigel/Bundesbank clash on the valuation of gold assets and jitters before French election on Sunday dampened sentiment. The DAX-30 ended down 88.58 points or 2.44 percent at 3,547.84, a fall of 54.35 since last Friday. In post bourse trade the index was down 72.65 at 3,562.73.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares closed the last trading day before Sunday's runoff parliamentary election vote with a slight gain, in exceptionally heavy volume. The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 4.70 points or 0.18 percent, at 2,583.94, a fall of 178.96 on the week.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Heavy profit-taking, easing European bourses and an early drop on Wall Street sent Swiss shares plummeting by nearly two percent. &quot;The fear of a correction offset the good interest rate prospects,&quot; one dealer said, adding that investors were nervous given the recent record levels on the bourse. The broad SPI ended down 53.24 points at 3,195.56 down 77.37 from last Friday.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks closed lower on Friday, weighed down by profit-taking sales of issues that had risen earlier in the day. Players were discouraged by an absence of usual month-end buying to support the market. The 225-share Nikkei average lost 243.42 points or 1.20 percent to close at 20,068.81 up 59.81 from last week.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong's blue chips ploughed into record territory on Friday as a surge in HSBC Holdings Plc shares propelled the Hang Seng Index to close at an all-time high. The blue-chip index soared 341.24 points, or 2.37 percent, to close at a peak of 14,757.81, a rise of 426.13 on the week.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - A bullish Australian share market bolted above the 2,600 level for the first time ever on Friday, shattering turnover milestones and records on the way. The All Ordinaries index soared 19.9 points to a record closing level of 2,610.5, up 46.6 from a week ago.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African shares ended weak as hopes of an early interest rate cut faded. Gold shares ended off lows but softer overall as they ignored a firmer bullion price. Industrials drop 77.7 points, or 0.93 percent, to 8,240.2, down 71.9 since last week. Golds lost 7.8 points to 1,173.8, a drop of 18.3 from last week and the all-shares index fell 53.0 points to 7,021.7, a fall of 50 from a week ago.</p>
