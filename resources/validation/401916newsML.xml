<p>The following stories appeared in Tuesday's Daily Variety:</p>
<p>* HOLLYWOOD - News Corp is joining forces with EchoStar Communications Corp in a $2 billion satellite-TV alliance. News Corp said it will invest $1 billion in cash and satellite assets related to its American Sky Broadcasting venture for a 50 percent stake in EchoStar, which is one of the smaller but fastest-growing satellite-TV operators.</p>
<p>* NEW YORK - News Corp plans to raise $800 million in asset sales to continue its heavy program of investment spending. News chairman Rupert Murdoch told investors the company would spend $1.8 billion on startup businesses, mainly its satellite TV ventures around the world, in the next 18 months. Among the startup businesses is the Fox News Channel, which News predicted would break even by the year 2000. News said it would spend $475 million on the channel, in both operational startup costs and getting carriage on cable systems.</p>
<p>* HOLLYWOOD - Fox Sports Net filed an antitrust lawsuit against Walt Disney Co, charging that Disney conspired with cable operators to keep Fox's fledgling regional sports cable networks - Fox Sports West 2 - from receiving wide distribution. The complaint, filed Monday in U.S. District Court, alleges that Disney tried to keep operators from contracting with West 2 and induced them to commit instead to carrying a future regional cable network from Disney -- a network that Disney has yet to acknowledge any plans to launch.</p>
<p>* HOLLYWOOD - The executive producers of television show &quot;Home Improvement&quot; have filed suit against parent Walt Disney Co claiming the studio, which distributes the show, is looking to cut a sweetheart renewal deal with its subsidiary network, ABC. The suit, filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court by &quot;Home Improvement&quot; executive producers Matt Williams, Carmen Finestra and David McFadzean, charges Disney with forcing its TV arm Walt Disney Television to offer a two-year renewal of ABC's Tuesday night mainstay at below-market terms so the studio won't have to share revenue with the producers.</p>
<p>* HOLLYWOOD - Seagram's Universal Pictures is in final negotiations on what sources said is a $750,000 against $1.5 million deal to hire Academy Award-winning screenwriter Frank Pierson to script a project based on a book called &quot;The People vs. Clarence Darrow&quot; for Ron Howard to direct, sources said. Other projects that have caught Howard's attention include &quot;Laws of Madness,&quot; which Universal picked up for $1.5 million in March 1996, and the comedy &quot;Ed TV,&quot; which Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz are writing.</p>
<p>* NEW YORK - Viacom's Paramount and &quot;Star Trek&quot; executive producer Rick Berman are in serious discussions with Imax Corp to create a &quot;Star Trek&quot; 3-D film with a running time of about 40 minutes and a budget of around $10 million. There's no deal yet and no script, but sources said the plan is either to use the cast from the &quot;Next Generation,&quot; &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; or &quot;Voyager&quot; series, or to cull characters from each. If that constellation of stars is unavailable, the third option is to assemble a new cast.</p>
<p>* HOLLYWOOD - United Artists Theatre Circuit has made several changes in its executive ranks. Chief financial officer Kurt Hall was named chief operating officer, and executive VP and head film buyer Robert Capps exited his post. Mike Pade, who has been with the company since 1994 and previously reported to Capps, was named as Capps' successor.</p>
