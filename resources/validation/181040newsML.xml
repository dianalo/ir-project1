<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ's Birch says Labour creating economic pressures.</title>
<headline>NZ's Birch says Labour creating economic pressures.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-11-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>New Zealand finance minister Bill Birch said on Monday a speech by Reserve Bank governor Don Brash clearly focussed on the pressures on monetary policy and the exchange rate if government spending rose substantially.</p>
<p>Brash spoke earlier at the day to a Federated Farmers meeting in Invercargill.</p>
<p>He said the second round of the government's NZ$3 billion tax cut package, due to be implemented in July, may have to be reconsidered if government spending rose following October's inconclusive general election.  </p>
<p>Brash also said the continued rapid rise of the New Zealand currency would weaken export growth.</p>
<p>Both Labour and New Zealand First have promised increased social spending, and the caretaker National party government has said it is committed to the second round of tax cuts.</p>
<p>Birch said the danger of the pressures increased spending would create was that, according to Brash, it would require &quot;very firm monetary conditions&quot; to hold inflation down.  </p>
<p>&quot;If that happens, then the very positive economic growth currently forecast for the next three years may not be achieved, thus damaging the present income and job prospects of New Zealanders,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I have noted that Labour's finance spokesperson Michael Cullen has made a public statement supporting Dr Brash. It is the additional spending advocated by Dr Cullen and Labour that is creating the pressures referred to by Dr Brash,&quot; Birch said.</p>
<p>New Zealand First leader Winston Peters gave Brash's speech a &quot;cautious&quot; welcome.  </p>
<p>&quot;In a large measure, the governor's statement reflects New Zealand First's concerns on the question of the exchange rate, the over-valued dollar and high interest rates,&quot; Peters said.</p>
