<p>Healthy gains on the Estonian stock market continued on Tuesday when almost all shares rose and the official list reached a record volume.</p>
<p>Total official list trade came to 72 million kroons and the Tallinn stock exchange index climbed by 3.05 percent to 183.37.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a bull market without much analysis,&quot; said one dealer, expressing scepticism over the gains.</p>
<p>Hansapank had the highest turnover at 23.5 million kroons and closed four kroons higher at 171 kroons.</p>
<p>Union Bank, yesterday's leader after it announced a merger with North Estonia Bank, lost some of its shine.</p>
<p>It registered trade of 20.7 million kroons but closed at 45.20 kroons, down 3.30 kroons. Savings Bank turnover was 10.4 million kroons and it finished five kroons higher at 81.50.</p>
<p>Some 7.9 million kroons of Forekspank shares changed hands and it closed up a strong 8.2 kroons at 135 kroons. It earlier announced that its 1996 profit was 46.5 million kroons.</p>
<p>Tallinna pank also made strong gains to close 7.75 kroons up at 67.50 kroons after turning over 5.8 millions kroons.</p>
<p>Over-the-counter-market trade was dominated by Rakvere meat plant which turned over 8.6 million kroons to close at 14.15 kroons, down 0.6 kroons.</p>
