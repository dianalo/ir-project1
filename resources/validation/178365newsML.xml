<title>BOSNIA: New Bosnian Serb army chief sworn in.</title>
<headline>New Bosnian Serb army chief sworn in.</headline>
<dateline>PALE, Bosnia 1996-11-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The man named to succeed indicted war criminal Ratko Mladic as Bosnian Serb military chief formally took office on Sunday, the official news agency SRNA reported.</p>
<p>At a swearing-in ceremony attended by Bosnian Serb president Biljana Plavsic, Major General Pero Colic vowed to &quot;defend the sovereignty, territory, independence and constitution of the fatherland, and loyally serve the interests of its people&quot;.  </p>
<p>The ceremony at Pale, the Serbs' political headquarters east of Sarajevo, marked the latest stage in Plavsic's &quot;restructuring&quot; of the army's command.</p>
<p>She announced on Saturday that she had retired Mladic and his deputy as part of an extensive shakeup. Mladic and his senior officers met later in their headquarters at Han Pijesak to discuss the dismissals. It was not immediately clear how they would react to Sunday morning's ceremony.</p>
<p>Western mediators and NATO officials said it may take some days to determine whether the sacked officers would accept Plavsic's decree or fight to retain their jobs.</p>
<p>Figures like international High Representative Carl Bildt have long been demanding that Mladic be extradited to a tribunal in The Hague to answer charges of war crimes and genocide. He stands accused of directing the siege of Sarajevo and overseeing the massacre of some 8,000 unarmed Moslems from the enclave of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia last year.</p>
