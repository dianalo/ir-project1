<title>SOUTH AFRICA: S.Africa rand/bonds closing report.</title>
<headline>S.Africa rand/bonds closing report.</headline>

<p>A late flurry of jobber selling pushed yields above the key 15 percent level on Monday after the market had spent much of the trading day idling around the 14.92 percent level.</p>
<p>At 1400 GMT, the key R150 was pegged at 15.05 percent from 14.915 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>Dealers said that the market was hit towards the local close by jobbers, frustrated by their earlier failed attempts to push yields lower, who sold into a thin market.</p>
<p>&quot;It's mainly been jobber selling,&quot; a trader said, noting that the Reserve Bank had been &quot;on the offer side&quot; on the day.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank may have been doing a bit of funding...it looked like it was on the offer side and that backed up the jobbers' belief that the market should go higher,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Weakness on the U.S. Treasury bond market, where the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond moved to 6.98 in early New York trade from 6.96 percent on Friday, also contributed to the local market's woes.</p>
<p>Dealers said that after seeing good two-way trade at the 14.92 percent level, the R150 hurdled a technical level at 15.02 percent before pausing for breath at 15.05 percent as local and offshore buying surfaced.</p>
<p>&quot;I would imagine that it will hold around here for now. There is a huge level at 15.07 percent...we have touched there four times and if it breaks we could go to the 15.40 area,&quot; a trader said.  </p>
<p>The rand took little notice of the bond market's weakness, holding a tight 4.43 to 4.44 range on the day.</p>
<p>It was last quoted at 4.4345/4375 against the dollar from 4.4370/4400 on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been very quiet today,&quot; a trader said, &quot;mainly two-way trade with a couple of local banks buying (dollars) and exporters selling.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that while the market had taken little notice of the bond market's slump, the rand could play catch-up on Tuesday, although interest was likely to be limited ahead of the long weekend.</p>
<p>All South African markets are closed on Friday for Human Rights Day.</p>
<p>Against the crosses, the rand was last quoted at 7.0499/0591 from 7.0807/0899 against sterling on Friday and at 0.3803/3806 marks from 0.3836/3840 previously.</p>
<p>On the money market, three-month deposit rates held steady at 16.50 to 16.55 percent offered, while the 90-day BA rate maintained its recent 15.90 to 16.10 percent range.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank said the money market shortage fell to 9.602 billion rand on Saturday from 10.861 billion on Friday.</p>
<p>Bond Exchange data showed foreigners bought a net 30.29 million rand's worth of bonds on Friday after buying 792.46 million rand's worth on Thursday.</p>
<p>Nominal cumulative volumes on Friday were 9.36 billion rand from 49.3 billion rand on Thursday -- a settlement day.</p>
