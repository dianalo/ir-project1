<p>Italian league leaders Internazionale hope to lay ghosts from the past to rest when they host Boavista of Portugal in the third round of the UEFA Cup on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The last time these two teams met in this competition -- in the 1991-92 season -- Inter were the defending champions, and they travelled to Portugal for the first leg of their first round tie in confident mood.</p>
<p>But they lost 2-1 and were then held at home 0-0 to go out of the Cup at the first hurdle.</p>
<p>Current form suggests the Italians should find things a little easier this time round.</p>
<p>Roy Hodgson's multi-million dollar side head serie A by a point despite being held 2-2 by mid-table Fiorentina at the weekend. They have lost just one of their nine league games to date.</p>
<p>By contrast, Boavista have never fully recovered from a dismal start to the season and lie 10th in the Portuguese league.</p>
<p>Inter will be without England midfielder Paul Ince, who is suspended after being sent off in his side's tense second round penalty shoot-out triumph over Austria's Casino Graz.</p>
<p>They also have three doubtful starters in injured French international midfielder Youri Djorkaeff, Chile striker Ivan Zamorano and defender Massimo Paganin. The latter two are both ill.</p>
<p>Swiss midfielder Ciriaco Sforza steps in for Ince and veteran Giuseppe Bergomi replaces Paganin as Inter continue their bid for their third UEFA Cup of the 1990s.</p>
<p>Boavista left for Milan without defender Rui Bento, who injured his left leg during his side's 3-0 win over Braga at the weekend, but they welcome back Romanian midfielder Ion Timofte, sidelined for two months by a leg operation.</p>
<p>Spain's Valencia, conquerers of holders Bayern Munich in the first round, face Besiktas of Turkey in a match which could spell the beginning of the end for coach Luis Aragones.</p>
<p>The Spanish side, runners-up in their league last year, were held 0-0 by bottom club Extremadura at the weekend after losing their previous three league matches, and the knives are out for Aragones.</p>
<p>To add to his problems, experienced Spain goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta is suspended after being sent off in the second round victory over Slavia Prague. Second-choice Jorge Bartual is expected to take Zubi's place.</p>
<p>Another side entering the third round on the back of poor league form are Hamburg, who face a difficult trip to Monaco in their first leg.</p>
<p>Felix Magath's side are just two points above the Bundesliga relegation zone despite their excellent form in Europe, which helped them see off Glasgow Celtic and Spartak Moscow in the previous rounds.</p>
<p>Magath will be without Bernd Hollerbach, who has an Achilles tendon injury, and is waiting on late fitness tests on Stefan Schnoor and Swiss Stephane Henchoz.</p>
<p>Monaco, who won 1-0 away at Caen on Saturday and are second in the French league, are plagued by injuries.</p>
<p>Five key players, including Belgian Enzo Scifo and France international Eric de Meco, have been missing for weeks, and another three players -- Brazilian Sonny Anderson, playmaker Ali Bernardbia and Nigeria's Viktor Ikpeba -- joined the casualty list after Saturday's match.</p>
<p>&quot;It was easy to shape up the squad,&quot; Monaco coach Jean Tigana said. &quot;I only have 16 valid players left.&quot;</p>
<p>France's other hopefuls, Metz, take on a Newcastle side who were inspired by Frenchman David Ginola in their 4-0 second round, second leg destruction on Hungary's Ferencvaros.</p>
<p>Metz will be relying on striker Robert Pires, frequently compared to Ginola in recent seasons. Pires was rested for Metz's defeat against Bastia on Saturday but will be back on Tuesday night for the clash with the English league leaders.</p>
<p>But the side from eastern France will be without two defenders -- suspended Pascal Pierre and injured Philippe Gaillot.</p>
<p>Helsingborg of Sweden face Anderlecht, who hope to have Danny Bofin back after missing their weekend league match with two thigh strains.</p>
<p>Ghanean Yaw Preko is also expected to return for the Belgians but Johan Walem is out with a thigh injury.</p>
