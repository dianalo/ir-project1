<headline>Danish shares hit new record, correction ahead.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1997-02-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Danish share prices closed at a new all-time record high again on Wednesday on foreign investor interest, advances by the two major banks and the strong dollar, but dealers said they expected a correction soon.</p>
<p>&quot;The KFX rise to another new record closing high came as a surprise to most, a correction had been expected to set in already today, but that will now be later,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index gained 0.79 point to 151.55 in overall bourse turnover of 1.399 billion crowns. The KFX March future rose one point to 150.80 with 246 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.  </p>
<p>KFX shares were mixed, but the two leading banks, fuelled by buoyant bombs, had a good day. Den Danske Bank closed seven crowns higher at 550, while rival Unidanmark put on six crowns to finish at 356.</p>
<p>Sophus Berendsen added a solid 11 crowns to its paper, ending the day at 860. Among the day's losers were Tele Danmark, which slipped one crown to 377, Danisco and Moeller's D/S Svendborg and D/S 1912.</p>
