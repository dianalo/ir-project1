<p>Former Texaco official Richard Lundwall was to be arraigned in federal court Tuesday in connection with the racial discrimination case against the big oil company, a spokesman at the U.S. attorney's office said.</p>
<p>Asked whether there would be any further arrests in the case, the spokesman said, &quot;the investigation is continuing.&quot;</p>
<p>CNN reported that Lundwall had been indicted on a charge of or obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>Texaco has suspended two executives and the benefits of two retirees who were allegedly involved in a plan to destroy documents in a racial discrimination lawsuit brought against Texaco by six black Texaco employees in 1994.</p>
<p>Texaco on Friday reached the biggest settlement of a racial discrimination case in the United States, agreeing to pay $176 million to settle the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The lawsuit charged the oil giant with systematically discriminating against blacks and denying them promotions.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney's spokesman said Lundwall would be arraigned in federal court in the New York suburb of White Plains, N.Y., where Texaco is based.</p>
