<p>International debt markets face weeks of anxiety over inflation as they wait to see whether the U.S. Federal Reserve was prudent to leave interest rates steady after a crucial policy meeting, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In such an uncertain environment, investors should avoid U.S. Treasuries and look for gains in Canada and Europe, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people had expected some sort of movement from the Fed and there is a concern that they are now starting to get behind the curve,&quot; said Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International in London.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets are vulnerable to any strong U.S. data and signs that inflation is picking up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Many analysts were busy reworking their bond strategies on Wednesday after Federal Reserve surprised some by keeping interest rates unchanged after its policy meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The federal funds rate was kept at 5.25 percent and the discount rate at five percent. There was no word of explanation from the central bank.</p>
<p>While bond prices initially greeted the decision by rising with relief, analysts expected relief to soon turn to angst as markets faced up to the reality of a bubbling U.S. economy and substantial wage inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation is reviled by bond markets because it eats into returns on a fixed yield.</p>
<p>Lurking in the background was the idea that the Fed had overlooked inflation pressures in order not to rock the economic policy boat before presidential elections on November 5.</p>
<p>&quot;There are two issues the market fears,&quot; said Adam Chester, international bond strategtist at Yamaichi International Europe in London. &quot;Firstly, that the Fed might be politically inspired and secondly that the Fed...might have too rosy a picture of growth in the second half,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chester said the economy was unlikely to slow as much as the Fed expected.</p>
<p>&quot;All the signs are that the fourth quarter is going to be very strong indeed going into the Christmas sales season.&quot; Inflation, buoyed by wage and oil price rises, would see a sharp rise over the balance of the year, he said.</p>
<p>Signs of a vibrant economy included second quarter growth of 4.8 percent, a jobless rate of 5.1 percent in August and a three-year rise in average earnings, analysts said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, inflation remained subdued at 2.9 percent in August.</p>
<p>IBJ's Edmonds said debt markets will remain on inflation guard until the next Federal Open Market Committee Meeting (FOMC) on November 13.</p>
<p>In the meantime major statistics, including September payrolls next Friday, will cause hand-wringing, he said.</p>
<p>If the data show growth remains robust, the Fed will have to consider a significant rate rise in November, said Edmonds. This could mean a 50 basis point rise.</p>
<p>&quot;There's always a risk that when a central bank delays, when they do move they have to be more aggressive,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>With uncertainty in the U.S. market set to linger, Michael O'Hanlon, chief international economist at PaineWebber in London, said Canadian markets looked a better bet.</p>
<p>&quot;The lack of a Fed move means there is a great possibility the Bank of Canada can cut rates which will help the short and long end of the market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>O'Hanlon also favoured core European markets but said investors should extend along the yield curve.</p>
<p>&quot;People whould extend duration in core Europe because the Bundesbank will continue to frustrate with the pace of its easing and the repo rate is likely to remain at three percent for a little while longer,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>High yielding markets, especially Italy, will continue to do well as long as the dollar does not suffer too much from the Fed's inaction, he said.</p>
