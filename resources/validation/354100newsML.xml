<p>Bahrain has arrested a group of people including a 10-year-old boy this week, an opposition group said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The London-based Bahrain Islamic Freedom Movement said in a statement sent to an international news agency those rounded up were from various Shi'ite Moslem villages. It did not give reasons for the alleged arrests.</p>
<p>It said the detainees included 10-year-old Hussain Youssef Ali al-Ajaza.</p>
<p>Also among those arrested were six youths aged 17 from Bani Jamra village, 12 km (eight miles) west of the capital Manama, the statement said. Two people from Abu Gua village and eight people from two families in Jidhafs village were also detained, it added.</p>
<p>Officials could not be immediately reached for comment on the group's claim.</p>
<p>Around 28 people have been killed in Bahrain in two years of sporadic unrest by members of the island's majority Shi'ite Moslems demanding political and economic reforms from the Sunni-led government. Hundreds have been arrested.</p>
