<p>Dutch chemicals group Akzo Nobel NV on Wednesday announced fractionally higher third quarter net profits but said it was targeting increased profitability through continued expansion of its most profitable activities.</p>
<p>Net profit came in at 328 million guilders ($193.4 million) versus 324 million guilders a year earlier, with operating profits at 510 million guilders versus 494 million guilders.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first quarter of this year in which not only sales but also operating income and net earnings improved,&quot; outgoing finance director Syb Bergsma told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We therefore maintain our earlier view that for the full year net income excluding extraordinary items will be of the same order of magnitude as in 1995,&quot; he said, adding the group did not expect to post any one-off gains or losses in 1996.</p>
<p>Bergsma said a 40 percent jump in operating earnings at the group's coatings division had been almost wiped out by lower contributions from fibres and chemicals.</p>
<p>Akzo would continue to shift the emphasis of its activities towards high-margin pharmaceuticals and coatings in the future, in a drive to achieve its profitability target of a 20 percent return on investment, Bergsma said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clearly our strategy to become more of a pharma and coatings company,&quot; he said, adding &quot;that's where the growth has to come from, these are the areas of higher margins.&quot;</p>
<p>Coatings and pharmaceuticals generated some two-thirds of group operating profit in the first nine months of this year and a hefty 80 percent in the third quarter, Bergsma said.</p>
<p>He said return on investment for the group as a whole currently amounted to around 16 percent.</p>
<p>Bergsma said that in coatings, the synergy effects of the 1994 merger between Akzo and Sweden's Nobel were paying off.</p>
<p>Chemicals had been hit by lower bulk selling prices although specialty chemicals had turned in improved results, he said.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical earnings were braked by the aftermath of the contraceptive pill scare which broke in October last year, hurting sales in Britain and Germany, Bergsma said.</p>
<p>&quot;The pill debate wasn't reflected in last year's third-quarter figure,&quot; he said, but added the sales appeared to have bottomed out and were starting to pick up again.</p>
<p>Start-up costs for two new drugs with high earnings potential had also depressed pharmaceuticals profits, Bergsma said.</p>
<p>Remeron, an anti-depressant Akzo claims has performed better in trials than well-known rival Prozac, is expected to unlock a billion-guilder market, while fertility drug Puregon is seen generating hundreds of millions of guilders in sales in time.</p>
<p>The figures gained a lukewarm reception from analysts, who had forecast third quarter net of 298-364 million guilders, with the consensus at 336 million.</p>
<p>Most believed chemicals could have turned in a better performance.</p>
<p>&quot;The results were slightly below our estimates,&quot; said Andreas de Groot, analyst with MeesPierson. &quot;What disappointed was the chemicals activities...but coatings was far more positive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would have thought the chemicals division could have done better,&quot; agreed Quirijn Mulder of ING Barings Research. &quot;I am still rating the company as an outperformer, but bringing my earnings per share forecasts for 1996 down a little.&quot;</p>
<p>On the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, Akzo shares shed three guilders to 214.60 by 1230 GMT. ($1=1.696 Guilder)</p>
