<p>London's Robusta coffee ended sharply higher on Tuesday, but failed to keep pace with New-York traded Arabica which continued to soar on fears of tight supplies.</p>
<p>&quot;The higher New York goes the more the two markets become separate,&quot; said one trader, referring to the arbitrage between New York and London that has widened to about 83 cents basis March.</p>
<p>A major strike by Colombian state-sector workers that began on Tuesday kept the market on the boil, although it's direct impact on coffee exports was not clear yet.</p>
<p>Origin sellers backed down, allowing prices to romp ahead amid early fund interest but roasters were not coming &quot;in a big way&quot;, one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is actually not a shortage of Robusta, whereas in Arabica everywhere you look there is bullish news,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>The benchmark May Robusta contract surged to an intraday high of $1,680 a tonne at the opening, taking its cue from New York, but quickly trimmed its gains, spending most of the session around the $1,650 area.</p>
<p>It ended $43 higher on the day at $1,643.</p>
<p>Technical analysts had earlier said that a constructive close above $1,620 in London would pave the way towards $1,800.</p>
<p>Turnover reached a strong 8,102 lots. March/May was traded at $10-12 as players continued to roll positions forward.</p>
<p>UK roasters, their higher costs cushioned by the strength of sterling against the dollar, reiterated that they had no plans to hike retail prices despite a spate of rises by European and U.S. roasters.</p>
<p>The latest announcement came from U.S.-based Procter and Gamble's Folgers Coffee Co which said it was raising the standard 13-ounce can of coffee by 15 cents effective on March 17.</p>
<p>One UK roaster representative said it wanted to keep consumer prices stable, and that he didn't believe the rally in futures was sustainable.</p>
<p>&quot;I dont think it's (the rally) going to go on forever. I think we will get further buying opportunities in this rally, there has to be a setback at some point,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Traders said some roasters were taking comfort in the fact that funds have a strong presence on the May contract, suggesting that nearby contracts could be subject to a major liquidation.</p>
