<p>Atlanta has used its Olympic momentum to improve its financial health while lowering property tax rates, the city's mayor and acting financial director told Bond Buyer Southeast Public Finance Conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Atlanta is safer and stronger and healthier than it's ever been,&quot; Mayor Bill Campbell told the conference, which continues through Friday. &quot;Taxes are lower. Everywhere you look, things are better than before.&quot;</p>
<p>Acting city finance director Judith Blackwell-Briscoe said the $423 million budget approved by the city commission earlier this week reflects a one percent spending cut over last year while giving the city's lowest paid workers a $500 bonus.</p>
<p>The budget reflects cuts in every department except public safety, which added 180 new police officers, partly because the city has been &quot;relentless in pursuing federal funding,&quot; Campbell said.</p>
<p>The city has cut its property tax rates by 40 percent, to 6.57 mills this year from 11.49 mills in 1993 while absorbing debt service for a $150 million infrastructure bond bill that was part of the pre-Olympic buildup, Campbell and Blackwell-Briscoe said.</p>
<p>Both painted a rosy picture of the city's financial health, dispelling notions that hosting the Centennial Olympics would boost prestige at the expense of its budget.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not lost any money from the Olympics,&quot; Blackwell-Briscoe said.</p>
<p>Instead, Campbell said,  &quot;We were able to use the Olympics as a catalyst.&quot;</p>
<p>The city used Olympic dormitory projects and Community Development Block Grants to convert some of its worst public housing projects to mixed-income, lower density housing, with enough success that it hopes to soon be taken off the federal HUD's &quot;most troubled list,&quot; Campbell said.</p>
<p>The city is also moving toward a &quot;24-hour downtown&quot; with the construction of Centennial Olympic Park, the revitalization of downtown housing, and with its successful efforts to persade the Atlanta Hawks to build a new downtown arena instead of leaving for the suburbs, Campbell said.</p>
<p>Additionally, he said the city's downtown area has attraacted a new federal office center that will consolidate 8,000 employees who used to be scattered at office buildings throughout the suburbs.</p>
<p>Campbell said the city hoped to further improve finances by boosting efforts to collect overdue taxes and fines. It raised $5 million by selling tax liens last year and plans another lien sale this year, he said.</p>
<p>The city has also hired a 23-member squad to collect the estimated $60 million it is owed in overdue parking and traffic fines, Campbell said. The effort was preceeded by an amnesty in January and early February that took in $1 million without any enforcement effort.</p>
<p>Additionally, the officials said the city would soon circulate requests for proposals to privatize operation and management of its water-sewer system, and hoped to have a contract in effect by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Savings from the plan, announced by Campbell last week, would reduce water rate hikes to 14 percent rather than the previously proposed 82 percent while still enabling the city to complete state-mandated improvements to its water-sewer system, the officials said.</p>
<p>The plan goes before the City Council March 3. Campbell gave assurances that no jobs in the 1,500-employee water-sewer department would be cut through 1998, though Blackwell-Briscoe said some workers would be offered early retirement and others might be re-employed as private contractors.</p>
<p>Blackwell-Briscoe acknowledged the proposal &quot;engenders an extreme reaction&quot; among both proponents and opponents but said, &quot;It has been done with great success in other places such as Indianapolis.&quot;</p>
