<p>&quot;My confidence has been shaken,&quot; admits Monica Seles.</p>
<p>Shock losses the last two weeks and trouble with her serve have Seles heading into next week's season-ending Chase Championships unsure of her game from day to day.</p>
<p>&quot;The way I am playing I'm taking it a match at a time at this point,&quot; Seles said on Monday about her chances at the $2 million tournament next week at Madison Square Garden. She won the event three years in a row from 1990-92.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, Seles, who has slipped into a co-ranking of number two in the world with Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, was surprised by 16-year-old Swiss Martina Hingis 6-2 6-0 in the final in Oakland. It was the first love set Seles had lost in six years.</p>
<p>The previous week in Chicago, Seles lost in the semifinals to Jennifer Capriati, who is in the midst of a comeback after two tumultuous years off the court including drug rehabilitaion and run-ins with the law.</p>
<p>&quot;The last two weeks have not been good at all and not what I would have liked them to be,&quot; Seles said in a telephone news conference from a New York airport en route to her home in Florida.</p>
<p>Seles said that Hingis and Capriati had played well, but she could not say the same about her own game.</p>
<p>&quot;Every game was close but they played better on the key points,&quot; said Seles. &quot;It was a combination that the two played very well and I couldn't do nothing. That's all I could figure from those two losses.&quot;</p>
<p>While Seles has ruled out surgery on her left shoulder for the rest of the year and denies the shoulder is bothering her, she has had trouble serving since winning the Australian Open in January.</p>
<p>&quot;My shoulder is fine,&quot; she said. &quot;I just started missing serves and lost some confidence. I couldn't hold my serve.&quot;</p>
<p>Seles, 22, is playing the Championships for the first time in four years. She was out from 1993-95 after being stabbed in the back during a match early in 1993. Last year she pulled out the week before the event with knee and ankle problems.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be nice to end the year off well, but it would not compensate for the way the year went,&quot; Seles said of her early-round exits at the French Open, Wimbledon and the Olympics. &quot;At the big ones, I would love to play my best tennis and I didn't.</p>
<p>&quot;So it wouldn't make that much difference the way I look back at '96 how I did next week,&quot; said Seles, the U.S. Open runner-up to Steffi Graf.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not one of the years I want to remember too much,&quot; said Seles.</p>
<p>WTA Tour officials announced Monday that three more players, Irina Spirlea of Romania, Karina Habsudova of Slovakia and Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of Holland, have qualified for the Championships.</p>
<p>The final three spots in the 16-player field was to be determined at this week's tournament in Philadelphia.</p>
