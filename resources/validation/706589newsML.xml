<p>Indonesian Information Minister Hartono has urged private television stations to exercise greater control over the contents of talk shows and productions they broadcast, the official Antara news agency reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Hartono, a former army general appointed as information minister last month, said he himself often became upset by some of the programmes shown on television.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was army chief, I already used to feel embarrassed by such programmes. How could the television stations have allowed such broadcasts,&quot; Hartono said.</p>
<p>The Media Indonesia newspaper on Thursday quoted a Moslem religious leader as saying he was concerned about a number of popular local talk shows as they discussed subjects such as family problems, homosexuality and sex among teenagers.</p>
<p>Hartono said a retired policeman recently complained to him following a television programme that demonstrated how morphine addicts self-administer injections.</p>
<p>&quot;This could give a bad example to others,&quot; he said, adding the ministry was studying such programmes and discussing how to make them academically and morally more justifiable.</p>
