<p>Turkish Finance Minister Abdullatif Sener, grappling with 80 percent inflation and huge budget deficits, on Friday unveiled an ambitious zero-deficit 1997 draft budget but economists and businessmen said its aims were unrealistic.</p>
<p>&quot;The 1997 budget is a balanced budget and aims to ensure stability,&quot; Sener told a news conference.</p>
<p>Mesut Yilmaz, leader of the main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP), scoffed: &quot;The government is working with dreams.&quot;</p>
<p>Sener said this year's budget deficit reached 751 trillion lira ($7.95 billion) in January-September this year, compared to 158.3 trillion lira in the same 1995 period.</p>
<p>He said budget spendings would be 6,255 trillion lira in 1997, compared to 3,946 trillion lira targeted for this year. The 1996 budget was revised to hit 1,300 trillion lira from 861 trillion predicted earlier.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan said the 1997 budget would help the cash-strapped treasury stop borrowing at current high interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Our new budget is the first balanced budget in Turkey for the past 50 years. Borrowing at high rates will stop. This is a revolution,&quot; Anatolian news agency quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>But bankers and businessmen expressed scepticism about the government's budget targets.</p>
<p>&quot;A zero-deficit budget is something unprecedented,&quot; Hasan Soydan of Garanti Yatirim Bank said.</p>
<p>Koray Cervatoglu from Baran Securities said: &quot;The targets are not convincing.&quot;</p>
<p>Sener said the budget aimed for a $20.5 billion trade deficit, against $16 billion for this year but government officials have said this year's trade deficit will go over $20 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;1997 exports are targeted to stand at $29.5 billion with a 20.4 percent rise (from 1996) and imports at $50 billion with an 11.1 percent increase,&quot; Sener said.</p>
<p>He said the government estimated 1997 current accounts deficit at $5.6 billion against this year's target of $3.8 billion. But economists and analysts said they expected this year's deficit to hit $7 billion.</p>
<p>The minister did not make clear how these projected deficits would be balanced but officials have previously outlined a series of revenue raising projects, including selling off the state telecom company.</p>
<p>State Minister Abdullah Gul has said two sets of measures announced recently would help realise the zero-deficit target in 1997. The government expects a total of $20 billion through the measures over three years.</p>
<p>Sener said the target for Gross National Product (GNP) growth was set at four percent for 1997, compared to an expected eight percent in 1996.</p>
<p>He said the budget targeted 1997 year-on-year wholesale inflation at 57.7 percent, compared to the target of 65 percent but an expected figure of 80 percent, this year.</p>
<p>Year-on-year wholesale inflation was 79.8 percent and consumer inflation 79.3 percent in September.</p>
<p>&quot;It is estimated that inflation will be 26 percent in the first six month of 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>This compares with 43.7 percent of wholesale inflation and 36.7 percent of consumer inflation in the same period this year.</p>
