<p>The world's leading central bankers on Monday dismissed the financial markets' plunge last week as an over-reaction to comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.</p>
<p>Playing down turbulence that rattled investors around the globe, Group of 10 (G10) central bankers suggested Greenspan had only raised the question of whether &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; had pushed stock prices higher, not declared that it had.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel to some extent there was an over-reaction to a question and the markets seem to be stable again,&quot; Hans Tietmeyer, chairman of the G10 central bankers and president of Germany's powerful Bundesbank, said after their monthly meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking at the developments of the last year, we should not overlook that there is some improvement in the fundamentals and this is to some extent reflected in the developments of the financial markets, but we will of course watch further developments very carefully,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Stock markets across Europe bounced back on Monday from Friday's sharp losses, but markets remained nervous about whether recent highs in many countries could be sustained.</p>
<p>Asked whether the G10 central bank governors were pleased with the markets' return to stability, Tietmeyer said: &quot;You can never say we are pleased, but of course the situation today seems more appropriate.&quot;</p>
<p>Greenspan, who did not attend Monday's meeting, sent world markets tumbling after he said the central bank needed to be wary when &quot;irrational exuberence&quot; infects stock and other asset markets because that could end up doing damage to the economy.</p>
<p>In a lecture on Thursday to the American Enterprise Institute, Greenspan stopped short of commenting on the recent steep run-up in Wall Street prices. But he made clear that the Fed would take the markets into account in setting policy.</p>
<p>Bank of England governor Eddie George also said he believed markets went too far last week on Greenspan's comments.</p>
<p>Asked whether markets had over-reacted in Friday's sell-off in stock and bond markets, George said: &quot;I think they did initially, but they soon sorted themselves out.&quot;</p>
<p>On other subjects, Tietmeyer gave a generally positive assessment of the world economy and said there was no special reason to worry about global currency markets or inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;We have looked at the inflation situation. There seems to be, according to the available information, no new reason for concern,&quot; Tietmeyer said after the meeting at the Bank for International Settlements in Basle.</p>
<p>Central bankers will always be vigilant about inflationary potential, he said, but added: &quot;The inflation outlook seems to be all in all positive.&quot;</p>
<p>He also cited &quot;positive development in most countries&quot; in terms of economic growth, although he noted this was stronger in some countries than in others.</p>
<p>&quot;But in most countries it is going in the direction of increasing growth rates, not very strong but in the direction of increasing growth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The G10 actually comprises 11 countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Canada, Italy, Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium and Switzerland.</p>
