<p>Taiwan stock index futures traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) will survive the opening of Taiwan's own futures market, a SIMEX official said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as we're concerned, international players and fund managers follow the MSCI Taiwan index,&quot; Ang Swee Tian, SIMEX president told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Ang said the SIMEX Taiwan stock futures contract, based on the Morgan Stanley Capital Index (MSCI), had performed well since its launch on January 9 despite the absence of Taiwan players banned from trading offshore Taiwan index contracts.</p>
<p>While the expected entry of Taiwanese retail customers would boost liquidity, Ang said the contract's success did not depend on their participation.</p>
<p>&quot;The international and regional market has to be our focus. International players get more from participating in an existing market and SIMEX offers a one-stop financial futures market place,&quot; Ang said.  </p>
<p>He said the expansion of open interest for the contract indicated that international investors were increasingly using it to hedge on the volatile Taiwan stock market.</p>
<p>He said the contract was the fourth most actively traded financial futures contract on SIMEX, after the Nikkei stock index futures, and three-month Euroyen and Eurodollar interest rate futures.</p>
<p>Volumes have picked up steadily since the contract's launch and currently average about 2,000 lots daily.  </p>
<p>&quot;I would be more comfortable if we're able to bring volume to about 5,000 lots a day,&quot; Ang said, noting that higher liquidity was likely to draw the interest of more international fund managers.</p>
<p>He said SIMEX was pleased to learn about moves by Taiwan authorities to legalise local trading of offshore Taiwan stock index futures.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to working closely with the Taiwan SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)...to foster the growth of the futures market in Taiwan,&quot; Ang said.  </p>
<p>Taiwan's Finance Ministry  approved a proposal on Tuesday to legalise trading of offshore stock index contracts listed on SIMEX and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and said it would submit the plan for cabinet approval soon.</p>
<p>Futures traders in Taiwan expect the cabinet to approve trading of the offshore stock index futures by June 1.</p>
<p>The launching of the SIMEX and CME futures have raised pressure on Taiwan to open its own futures exchange, which some officials said could happen as early as October.  </p>
<p>They said they expected contracts linked to the benchmark TAIEX index of the main Taiwan Stock Exchange to be the first item traded on the new futures exchange.</p>
