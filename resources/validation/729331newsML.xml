<p>Wall Street stocks finished broadly higher on Tuesday, lifting the Dow industrials to an all-time high and propelling Nasdaq to its ninth consecutive record close.</p>
<p>The Dow climbed 53 points to close unofficially at 7976, the blue chip average's first new high in a week.</p>
<p>Tech stocks extended their dominance, with Hewlett-Packard Co ranking as the Dow's strongest component for a third straight day, climbing 3-1/2 to 68-9/16 in New York Stock Exchange activity.  </p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard's gains again mirrored those among the resurgent tech group, where mounting optimism has powered Nasdaq to a string of record highs second only to a 10-session run that ended May 1, 1996.</p>
<p>In the process, investors have largely shaken off the effects of some high-profile earnings warnings early in the quarter, most notably from Intel Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a growing conviction the group is going to do better earnings-wise later in the year and into 1998,&quot; said Al Goldman, analyst at A.G. Edwards and Sons.  </p>
<p>Shortly after the close, Intel reported second quarter earnings of $0.92 per share, two cents higher than First Call's consensus analyst estimate.</p>
<p>The powerhouse performance in the tech sector appeared to breathe new life into suddenly sluggish blue chips, which have tracked sideways since nearing the 8,000 mark early last week.</p>
<p>The Dow also overcame some concerns that the soaring U.S. dollar, which has approached six-year highs against the German mark, might eventually erode profits at multinational corporations.  </p>
<p>While analysts acknowledged currency exchange rates could become a burden at some point, many argued the strong dollar also brought near-term benefits offsetting longer-term profit concerns for stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar's rise is a two-way sword,&quot; said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Primark Decision Economics. &quot;It hurts the profit outlook of big multinationals but valuations of our markets are helped because foreign buyers come in.&quot;</p>
<p>With quarterly earnings season in high gear, however, the market's mood is likely to shift with the tide of major earnings reports.  </p>
<p>An early boost came today from Texas Instruments Inc, which leaped 12 points to 109-1/2 after the semiconductor giant reported earnings that more than tripled from year-ago levels.</p>
<p>The solid results at first boosted chip stocks, then the broader technology group, and then, for the first time in a week, tech stocks helped lift the broader market, putting the Dow back in position to crack 8,000.</p>
<p>&quot;While the techs had been strong, they were playing catch-up and now everything is finally even,&quot; said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market finally starts looking like it's ready to start firing on all cylinders,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In individual issues, Merrill Lynch and Co Inc gained 2-3/8 to 66-1/16 after reporting a second quarter profit of $481 million, the highest in its history.</p>
<p>CCA Prison Realty Trust PZN.N gained 7-7/8 to 28-7/8 in its Wall Street debut. The company is a real estate investment trust focusing on private prison properties.</p>
<p>Lam Research Corp jumped 8-3/8 to 58 after Cowen &amp; Co upgraded the semiconductor equipment maker to buy from neutral.  </p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index rose 7.38 points to 925.76, a record.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite rose 18.23 points to 1542.11.</p>
