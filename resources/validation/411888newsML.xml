<title>UK: FORECAST-Ladbroke 1996 profit to rise.</title>
<headline>FORECAST-Ladbroke 1996 profit to rise.</headline>

<p>British betting and hotel company Ladbroke Group Plc is expected to report a profit rise of around 30 percent when it releases its 1996 figures on Thursday.</p>
<p>Analysts are forecasting pre-tax, pre-exceptional profits in the 155-165 million pound range, against 121.3 million pounds a year ago. Net dividend is forecast at between 6.0 and 6.2 pence per share, compared with 6.0p.</p>
<p>Ladbroke first half pre-tax profit rose 29 percent to 72.8 million pounds on the back of an improvement in betting and gaming and a good performance from Hilton International hotels.</p>
<p>The figures were overshadowed by the news that Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels Corp (HHC) had agreed to reunite the Hilton hotels brand worldwide for the first time in 32 years.</p>
<p>The deal, which the companies say could be worth tens of millions of dollars annually, was sealed in January.</p>
<p>Previously HHC had the rights to the Hilton name in the U.S. and Ladbroke owned them in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Analyst Greg Feehely of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson expects HHC to move swiftly to acquire the five percent holding in Ladbroke it has said it will take &quot;in due course&quot;.</p>
<p>He noted that HHC President and CEO Stephen Bollenbach is now a board member at Ladbroke and so HHC could not buy the stake in the &quot;closed period&quot; before the results were published.</p>
<p>Feehely said that Hilton's $6.5 billion bid for ITT Corp should not affect its plans to take the Ladbroke stake, arguing that Bollenbach already had the ITT move in mind when he sealed the Hilton alliance.</p>
<p>Ladbroke has said that it will take an exceptional charge of 15.4 million pounds to cover an adjustment on the price of DIY retailer Texas Homecare, which it sold to J.Sainsbury Plc two years ago.</p>
<p>A number of disputes relating to the completion accounts on the deal were recently settled by an independent expert. Ladbroke expressed satisfaction with the outcome.</p>
<p>Feehely said that Ladbroke may also take an exceptional write-down on the value of its commercial property portfolio, a sector from which the company is withdrawing.</p>
<p>There has been speculation that Ladbroke plans to launch a rival bid for London casino operator Capital Corporation Plc, the subject of a 181 million pound approach from London Clubs International.</p>
<p>Ladbroke has refused to comment on the talk.</p>
