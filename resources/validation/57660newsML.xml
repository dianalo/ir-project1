<p>International soccer's biggest problem is refereeing mistakes, Spain coach Javier Clemente said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The big problem is refereeing mistakes. You need perfect referees, but where is the perfect referee?&quot; Clemente said during a break on the second day of the three-day UEFA National Coaches Convention held by European soccer's governing body.</p>
<p>But Clemente, whose side were eliminated by hosts England on penalties in the Euro 96 quarter-finals in June, said perfection in football was not a good thing.</p>
<p>He said he did not favour the introduction of technology as a means of reducing the chances of mistakes by referees, such as televised slow-motion replays.</p>
<p>&quot;In my opinion, technology must not come into football, because then the arguments will end and without arguments football will die.</p>
<p>&quot;We would lose the great attraction of football, that a modest team can upset a big team,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Euro 96 suffered from several glaring mistakes by referees including an apparently valid goal scored by Spanish striker Julio Salinas against England which was disallowed and a penalty awarded to the Czech Republic in the final against Germany for a foul which video replays showed was a metre outside the box.</p>
<p>Clemente said he was against tampering with the laws of football as a means of encouraging a more attacking game and settling matches which ended drawn after extra time.</p>
<p>&quot;The golden goal can be a traumatic experience, but then it also has its good side,&quot; Clemente said.</p>
<p>&quot;A replay would be ideal but there isn't space in a major competition lasting a short time.&quot;</p>
<p>Clemente said the game's authorities were always looking to make football more dynamic and that this was central to discussions at the convention.</p>
<p>&quot;Some time back we got to 23 effective minutes of play in 45 minutes, now it's up to 31. Ruling that the goalkeeper mustn't handle a back pass has contributed to this,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea is that we should play more. But we'll still be 11 against 11 next year.&quot;</p>
