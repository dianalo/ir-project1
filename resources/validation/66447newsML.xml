<p>Defending Solheim Cup champions United States thrashed Europe in the early foursome play Friday and held on for a 5-3 first-day lead after the home side bounced back in the afternoon fourballs competition.</p>
<p>World No. 1 Laura Davies made amends for a dismal putting display in the morning by playing superbly with fellow Briton Trish Johnson to win their fourballs match 6 and 5 against Americans Kelly Robbins and Pat Bradley.</p>
<p>The powerful Davies was seven under par for her round when the match ended on the 13th green.</p>
<p>The Solheim Cup, being contested at St Pierre, is the women's golf equivalent of the more famous Ryder Cup men's competition, which pits a team of U.S. players against the top European golfers.</p>
<p>Europe led all four matches for much of the afternoon but the Americans clawed back 1-1/2 points in the final two contests.</p>
<p>Europe won the fourballs 2-1/2 points to 1-1/2, but the Americans's 3-1/2 to 1/2 victory in the foursomes left them in the driver's seat at the end of the day.</p>
<p>There are four more foursomes and four fourballs Saturday with 12 singles set for Sunday in the biennial contest between the women professionals from opposite sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>European captain Mickey Walker was full of praise for Davies and Johnson. &quot;Their golf was incredible. It has been a wonderful afternoon,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Davies had missed three short putts in the first eight holes of her foursomes with Alison Nicholas and a crucial putt of three feet at the 15th as they lost by one hole to Patty Sheehan and Rosie Jones.</p>
<p>But she missed nothing after a lunch which she said was pretty quiet until Scottish rookie Kathryn Marshall put on some rock music to cheer up the team after their morning disappointment.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not practise putting during the break. I hit maybe a dozen just before I started out. Eventually they go in,&quot; said Davies.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously we made Laura mad,&quot; U.S. captain Judy Rankin said. &quot;I don't think any options I had this afternoon would have beaten Laura. And Trish played well, too.&quot;</p>
<p>Europe's second fourballs win came when Marshall and Annika Sorenstam of Sweden beat Val Skinner and Jane Geddes by one hole.</p>
<p>American Dottie Pepper was the only player to win two points. She and Brandie Burton came from behind to beat Swedes Helen Alfredsson and Liselotte Neumann 2 and 1 in the morning after the Swedish pair bogeyed four successive holes from the 14th.</p>
<p>Then Pepper and Betsy King scored a one-hole fourballs victory over Neumann and fellow Swede, Catrin Nilsmark. Pepper holed a crucial 15-footer to halve the 15th after Nilsmark had made an 18-footer for birdie.</p>
<p>In the final fourballs Beth Daniel and Meg Mallon halved with Helen Alfredsson and Nicholas when Daniel made a 12-foot birdie putt at the last hole.</p>
<p>&quot;Beth gave away a couple of holes earlier with her putting,&quot; Rankin said. &quot;It was a very big putt she made at the 18th.&quot;</p>
<p>Walker was impressed by the fifth-ranked Pepper, whose form for the first half of the year left her thinking she might not even make the team.</p>
<p>&quot;Dottie played fantastic golf. Whenever a European did something she equalled it,&quot; Walker said.</p>
