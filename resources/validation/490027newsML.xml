<p>Indian stocks are expected to drift in range-bound trade this week as players shy away from building positions with the fate of the federal government unknown, brokers and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will stay in a trading zone. At this point of time, it's better to adopt a wait-and-watch policy,&quot; S. Sriram, strategist at Lloyds Securities said.</p>
<p>Stocks took a tumble last week after the Congress party in a sudden move withdrew its make-or-break support to Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's 10-month-old minority government, plunging the country into a political crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything depends on political alignment. There should be clarity for buying to come in a big way,&quot; said K.R. Choksey, a member-broker of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).</p>
<p>Deve Gowda's 15-party United Front alliance now has to face a vote of confidence in parliament on April 11.</p>
<p>Market optimism that the week-old political crisis might not hold a pro-business 1997/98 (April-March) budget to ransom helped shares buffet sharp early losses, but the undercurrent was shaky.</p>
<p>Bombay's benchmark 30-share index fell over eight percent on Monday, but at week's close it was down 3.08 percent, or 113.16 points on the week, at 3,550.37.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a general consensus that the budget will get passed,&quot; Lloyds Securities' Sriram said. The widely-acclaimed budget was expected to be passed when parliament reconvened on April 21.</p>
<p>The United Front ruling alliance has only 180 votes in the 542-member lower house of parliament, but had survived with the support of Congress party's 140 seats.</p>
<p>Neither the market nor the politicians want snap polls so soon after last May's general elections provided inconclusive results.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a fair possibility that we might see a compromise among the political parties,&quot; Sriram said. &quot;Elections are the worst possible scenario that we can probably see.&quot;</p>
<p>Select funds with a long-term investment strategy were however large buyers in blue chips available at attractive valuations in the jittery market, traders said.</p>
<p>Buying into these stocks in the political chaos was likely to reward investors with a long-term perspective, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you are an investor, you have to take a 12-month view,&quot; Gul Tekchandani, chief investment officer at Sun Foreign &amp; Colonial Asset Management told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a liquidity cycle which is improving -- interest rates are expected to go down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Politicians expect Congress and United Front leaders to keep up tough rhetoric in coming days as efforts continued behind the scenes to find a face-saving solution that would avert mid-term elections neither side wants.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they (political parties) will have to find a compromise,&quot; Tekchandani said. &quot;We believe elections are not a reality.&quot;</p>
