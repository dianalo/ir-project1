<title>INDONESIA: Jakarta shares end lower on profit taking.</title>
<headline>Jakarta shares end lower on profit taking.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-01-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Continued profit-taking in blue chips and secondaries which made healthy gains earlier on Monday saw Jakarta shares closing lower, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Composite Index fell 1.78 points, or 0.27 percent, to close at 656.09 points but recovered from a low of 655.12 points. Decliners outpaced advancers 52 to 41, with 71 counters unchanged. Total volume was 133.5 million shares on a turnover of 284.98 billion rupiah.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was likely to be mixed on Tuesday as some investors were expected to continue making one-day forays due to the lack of fresh leads.  </p>
<p>&quot;Active buying of some fundamentally-sound stocks failed to push the index into positive field as many sellers were cashing in their profits today,&quot; a broker with foreign firm said.</p>
<p>Brokers said speculative buying in the late session in counters such as Barito Pacific, Summarecon and Kalbe Farma had prevented the index from further falling.</p>
<p>Timber firm Barito Pacific topped the active list with 28 million shares traded, rising 17.74 percent, or 275 rupiah to 1,825 rupiah on a spate of rumours including acquisitions and that the company had just secured a big loan, brokers said.  </p>
<p>They said the counter also attracted attention on talk that President Suharto's eldest daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana was planning to buy a large stake in the firm.</p>
<p>A Barito official declined to comment on the rumours but said the market had possibly started to realise the value of the stock.</p>
<p>Another broker, however, attributed the rise to market talk of expected strong earnings in 1996 after reports of a rise in Indonesia's forestry exports last year.</p>
<p>Indonesia's export earnings from the forestry sector rose to $8.3 billion in 1996 from $7.1 billion in 1995.  </p>
<p>Pharmaceutical producer Kalbe Farma was actively traded on speculative interest following talk that a company might buy a large stake in the firm, brokers said.</p>
<p>Company officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Kalbe Farma rose 150 rupiah to 3,100 on 1.7 million shares.</p>
<p>Paper producer Tjiwi Kimia rose 50 rupiah to 2,500 on 2.3 million shares on news that it would benefit from a sustained high global pulp inventory.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect pulp prices to either remain stagnant or drop through the year, while regional paper prices remain strong,&quot; Peregrine Sewu Securities said in its weekly report.  </p>
<p>Peregrine said the trend was bad news for Indonesian pulp producers such as Indorayon and Indah Kiat.</p>
<p>However, it said, the trend should benefit margins and earnings for paper producer Tjiwi Kimia.</p>
<p>Bank Negara Indonesia, Bank Servitia, Telkom and Bimantara Citra were among the targets of profit-takers, brokers said.</p>
<p>Bank Negara Indonesia fell 25 rupiah to 1,275 on 13.1 million shares, while Bank Servitia eased to 1,025 rupiah on 1.8 million shares after rising to 1,050 earlier.</p>
<p>Heavyweights telecommunications firm Telkom and conglomerate Bimantara Citra were easier at the close after early gains.  </p>
<p>Telkom closed at 4,200 on 4.3 million shares after rising 25 rupiah to 4,225 in the morning, while Bimantara closed at 3,150 on 1.1 million shares after rising to 3,175 rupiah earlier.</p>
<p>Cement maker Semen Gresik rose 100 rupiah to 7,425 rupiah before closing at 7,325 rupiah on 1.8 million shares on selling pressure from profit-takers, brokers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said sentiment on the counter was boosted earlier by news that the firm would announce this week its December sales and projections for 1997, coupled with news that its units PT Semen Tonasa and Semen Padang were among five cement producers allowed by the government to export 215,000 tonnes in the first quarter.</p>
