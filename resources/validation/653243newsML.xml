<headline>Prosecutor may seek mistrial in Kevorkian case.</headline>

<p>The prosecutor in Dr. Jack Kevorkian's fourth assisted-suicide trial said on Wednesday he may request a mistrial after a day of acrimonious wrangling between attorneys during opening statements.</p>
<p>Ionia County Prosecutor Raymond Voet said he was concerned about the argumentative tone of defence attorney Geoffrey Fieger's opening statement and planned to research whether a mistrial would prohibit him from re-charging Kevorkian with helping Loretta Peabody, 54, die.</p>
<p>&quot;The jury must be full of questions and confusion about the inflammatory things that ought not to be before the jury,&quot; Voet told reporters after he asked for an early break in the court's proceedings on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 69-year-old retired pathologist was charged with four felonies in the Aug. 30, 1996, death of Peabody, who had multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>Kevorkian, who has acknowledged being present at 45 deaths since 1990, was not in court for the opening of his trial in Ionia, a conservative town of 7,000 in west-central Michigan.</p>
<p>It was the first time Kevorkian faced assisted suicide charges outside of the Detroit area. Juries on three occasions in 1994 and 1996 acquitted him of similar charges involving five deaths.</p>
<p>Earlier, Voet urged the jury of eight men and six women, comprised mostly of people in their 20s and 30s, to follow the law and not be swayed by the emotional debate around assisted suicide in deciding Kevorkian's fate.</p>
<p>&quot;If you base your decision upon sympathy and prejudice, when this case is over, then you violated your oath,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Voet also told jurors they were not in court to judge the Peabodys but to judge Kevorkian.</p>
<p>Fieger fired back by accusing Voet of being on a &quot;witchhunt&quot; and harassing Peabody's former husband, daughter and other family members, who were all seated in court behind Kevorkian's defence team.</p>
<p>Standing in front of an enlarged photograph of a smiling Loretta Peabody, Fieger asked jurors to protect the Peabody family against prosecutors who want to take away their private rights to end suffering.</p>
<p>&quot;You're the jury. You're the conscience of this community. You are their neighbours. You are the people. And they need your help -- now. They need you to say never, ever again,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Fieger also read in court part of a letter Voet wrote in January urging the new Oakland County prosecutor to proceed with charges against Kevorkian. Fieger said that showed a conspiracy among prosecutors.</p>
<p>Ionia County Circuit Court Judge Charles Miel ruled the rest of the letter cannot be read to jurors.</p>
