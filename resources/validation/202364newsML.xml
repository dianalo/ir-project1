<p>Russia's surplus on the current account balance of payments is likely to halve in 1997 to $6 billion from an expected $12 billion this year, macro-economic analysts HILFE said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>This would be due to a narrowing in the trade surplus to $14 billion from an expected $21 billion this year, the London-based analysts said in a report.</p>
<p>The figures are for Russia's total foreign trade, including other former Soviet republics.</p>
<p>&quot;The boost to exports provided this year by higher world energy prices is unlikely to be repeated, while imports growth should remain in double digits,&quot; it said of next year's trade performance.</p>
<p>&quot;But this will not necessarily hamper a rise in foreign exchange reserves, as the capital account will put in a better performance, and public demand for dollars may lessen as the benefits of high-yielding rouble deposit accounts become more apparent in a low inflation environment,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Subdued inflation is dependent on parliamentary approval of the draft 1997 budget, and assumes parliament will not succeed in getting the government to boost money supply to stimulate the economy, it said.</p>
<p>HILFE said the rise in energy prices in 1996 which has allowed export value to increase beyond the rise in export volume is unlikely to be repeated in 1997.</p>
<p>Over the first eight months of this year, Transneft data show crude oil exports rose three percent year-on-year to 83.4 million tonnes, while the price of European Brent rose 12.9 percent to an average $19.3 per barrel. The rise in oil prices over the whole of 1996 could approach 20 percent.</p>
<p>Non-energy exports are unlikely to rise much in 1997 as the quality of most industrial goods is low, but demand for imports, especially of capital goods, will pick up, it said.</p>
