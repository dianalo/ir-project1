<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian socialite &quot;careless&quot; with A$1 mln jewels.</title>
<headline>Australian socialite &quot;careless&quot; with A$1 mln jewels.</headline>

<p>An Australian socialite and one-time wife of a former foreign minister, lost almost A$1 million (US$790,000) in jewels to a thieving maid, but didn't notice until she saw another woman wearing her A$50,000 necklace and bracelet.</p>
<p>A judge who jailed Lady Susan Renouf's maid for two years said the wealthy socialite was careless with what he called an &quot;Aladdin's cave&quot; of top-quality jewels, Australian newspapers reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;It was only apparently on (Renouf) seeing a woman wearing two items of the stolen property in a public place... that it seems she realised that the jewellery had been stolen at all,&quot; Sydney judge Brian Herron was quoted as saying in the Daily Telegraph and Sydney Morning Herald.</p>
<p>Herron said that, based on maid Lynne Metcalf's evidence, Renouf &quot;... had a lifestyle characterised by opulence and extravagance, suggestive of an Aladdin's cave of jewels, with expensive pieces left in kitchen drawers, in the family car and scattered through various places throughout the house&quot;, he said in a sentencing Metcalf on Friday.</p>
<p>Police would not comment on the court case on Saturday.</p>
<p>Renouf, once married to former conservative opposition leader Andrew Peacock, foreign minister from 1975-80 and now Australia's ambassador to Washington, could not be immediately contacted.</p>
<p>Metcalf, who was paid A$12 an hour, took the jewels over 10 years and sold the bulk for just A$40,000, the court heard.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there is any dispute that Lady Renouf was fairly careless in regard to the security of these items,&quot; Herron said.</p>
<p>Metcalf pleaded guilty to 22 counts of stealing jewels worth a total A$928,000.</p>
