<p>Following the U.S. veto of a second term for Boutros Boutros-Ghali, some U.N. diplomats may be dusting off an old precedent under which the first secretary-general, Trygve Lie of Norway, won an abbreviated second term in the teeth of a Soviet veto.</p>
<p>Although supporters of Boutros-Ghali might draw some encouragement from that scenario, it occurred in an entirely different diplomatic climate and when the balance of authority between the Security Council and the General Assembly was very different. Also, the outcome left the United Nations badly wounded.</p>
<p>Lie, elected secretary-general for a five-year term beginning Feb. 1, 1946, had initially enjoyed strong Soviet support for a second term.</p>
<p>But with the outbreak of the Korean war in June 1950, when the United Nations gave its blessing to a United States-led force to repel the invading North Koreans, Moscow turned sharply against him.</p>
<p>Under article 97 of the U.N. Charter, a secretary-general is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council.</p>
<p>When Lie's candidacy came up for renewal, the Soviet Union promptly used its council veto to block him.</p>
<p>Despite the absence of a recommendation from the council, the issue was taken up by the General Assembly, where there is no veto, and in November 1950 Lie's term was extended for three years, despite Soviet bloc opposition.</p>
<p>The United States and Lie's other backers argued that this was perfectly legal since he was not being elected to a new term but rather having his original term extended.</p>
<p>Moscow and its allies retaliated by boycotting Lie, not only when it came to diplomatic business but even to the extent of refusing to invite him to their receptions and other social functions.</p>
<p>His position became so untenable -- and the effect on the working of the organisation so unsettling-- that Lie announced to the General Assembly on Nov. 10, 1952, that he intended to resign before the end of his extended term.</p>
<p>Dag Hammarskjoeld of Sweden, after being recommended by the Security Council, was installed by the General Assembly for a five-year term on April 10, 1953. He was later elected to a second term beginning April 10, 1958, but was killed in an air crash in Africa in 1961.</p>
<p>Many diplomats believe that Boutros-Ghali, like Lie in 1950, would receive overwhelming backing if the question of an extended term were to be decided by the General Assembly, which now has 185 members compared to only 60 all those years ago.</p>
<p>But in an era when the authority of the Security Council has soared while that of the General Assembly has declined, few diplomats believe the council would again allow itself to be circumvented through a diplomatic subterfuge.</p>
<p>Also, since the Soviet bloc was widely regarded in 1950 as supporting communist aggression in Korea, other U.N. members might have shed few tears if it had decided to react to the extension of Lie's term by quitting the organisation.</p>
<p>And if a Soviet boycott of the secretary-general hamstrung the United Nations for more than two years, the appointment of someone against the wishes of the United States -- even if such a thing were possible -- might well sound the organisation's death knell.</p>
