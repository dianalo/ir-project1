<p>An air raid on Kabul on Thursday killed three people and wounded two others as Afghan opposition forces moved to within rocketing range of the capital, travellers and eyewitnesses said.</p>
<p>The opposition plane swept low over Kabul just before 3 p.m. (1030 GMT) and dropped a single bomb close to the Ariana Hotel. The hotel is in the city's east, close to the Presidential Palace and the defence ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;Three people are dead and another two were injured,&quot; said Abdul Shukoor Motmayn, the Taleban minister of sport, who was at the scene minutes after the bomb dropped.</p>
<p>There were bloodstains on the roundabout outside the hotel. Rubble and broken pine-tree branches were strewn across the road and the smell of pine mingled with that of dust and high explosive.</p>
<p>The hotel, which was being used as a Taleban guest house, was badly damaged. Part of the roof collapsed as Taleban fighters looked for more survivors inside. There were no further injuries. It is not clear if the dead and injured were Taleban fighters or passers by.</p>
<p>Travellers and eyewitnesses said opposition ground forces had moved to within 12 miles (20 km) of the Afghan capital, putting the opposition within rocketing range of Kabul for the first time in nine months.</p>
<p>&quot;The front line is now at Pol-e-Sufian (northwest of Kabul), there was some fighting early this morning, but it is now quiet,&quot; bus driver Mohammed Arif said on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Arif was driving a bus laden high with the household goods of families fleeing the fighting.</p>
<p>Taleban fighters denied journalists access to the front line, making it impossible to check Arif's comments.</p>
<p>At least six rockets landed around Kabul's airport just after midday (0730 GMT) on Thursday. The rockets landed on waste ground north of the airport and there were no reports of casualties.</p>
<p>Opposition jets also dropped a single bomb close to the main road leading to the northwestern front line. The bomb did little damage and there were no casualties, according to Taleban guards on duty at the pass.</p>
<p>The anti-Taleban alliance have been stepping up their air attacks on Kabul over recent weeks, but Thursday's attack was the first on the central part of the city.</p>
<p>The low-flying plane seemed to catch the Taleban anti-aircraft gunners by surprise. They began shooting only after the plane had begun its escape after dropping the bomb.</p>
<p>Last Sunday a single bomb landed in a residential district close to the airport, killing seven people and wounding 12 others.</p>
<p>The United Nations has called on the warring parties in Afghanistan to cease aerial bombing, citing the danger it posed to non-combatants.</p>
<p>Kabul was noticeably quiet on Thursday, with fewer people on the streets and less activity in the markets.</p>
<p>The opposition have been this close to Kabul before, last October. At that time they were unable to hold the Taleban advance and were pushed north, away from Kabul and into the mountains.</p>
<p>In October the Taleban were riding high after taking Kabul the month before. But recently the Taleban have lost men and morale after a string of defeats in the north and centre of the country. There was little evidence of substantial Taleban reinforcements arriving in Kabul or serious preparations to defend the city on Thursday.</p>
<p>At least five more aid workers left Kabul on Thursday. Twenty international staff drove east from Kabul to the Pakistan border on Wednesday to escape from the uncertain security situation.</p>
<p>Kabul airport has been closed due to the rocketing and frequent air raids.</p>
<p>Aid workers working in the east of the country say that the road to Pakistan is also under threat from the opposition. They say that the Taleban-held town of Sarobi, 37 miles (60 km) from Kabul, is under threat from an opposition force.</p>
<p>The road was still open on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>The opposition north of Kabul is led by Ahmed Shah Masood, a veteran of the 10-year battle against the Soviet army in the 1980s. He was the military power behind the administration of President Burhanuddin Rabbani. The administration was ousted from Kabul by the Taleban last September.</p>
