<p>Security forces in southeast Turkey are on alert for further suicide strikes after rebel Kurds killed eight people and themselves in human bomb attacks in the last week, military officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are getting tip-offs that there will be new suicide attacks -- around three or four,&quot; an army official told Reuters in the eastern town of Tunceli. &quot;We don't know where or when, but generally their targets have been the army or police.&quot;</p>
<p>The official said the interior ministry had issued orders for special precautions to be taken in the provinces of Tunceli, Sivas, Diyarbakir, Erzincan and Bingol following the attacks by female militants dressed up as pregnant women with explosives strapped to their waist.</p>
<p>The ERNK, the political wing of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), issued a statement late on Wednesday in which it warned of &quot;a new era of metropolitan actions and new examples of heroism...if the Turkish government continues to refuse to take the warnings of the Kurdish people seriously.&quot;</p>
<p>A 17-year-old woman PKK guerrilla blew up herself and four others in an attack in the southern town of Adana last Friday.</p>
<p>Another female PKK militant -- identified as Guler Otas -- blew up an explosive device strapped to her body when she and another rebel were in a police car after being detained in the central town of Sivas on Tuesday, Turkey's Republic Day holiday.</p>
<p>The rebels, three police officers and a civilian were killed in that blast. It was the third since the rebels, fighting for self-rule, launched a campaign of suicide attacks on the model of bombings by the Palestinian group Hamas.</p>
<p>The first attack, in July, was carried out by another woman guerrilla in the province of Tunceli, haunt of elusive PKK regional commander Semdin &quot;Fingerless Zeki&quot; Sakik.</p>
<p>Military officials say Otas was trained by Sakik, whom the army has tried in vain to hunt down in numerous operations since he arrived in Tunceli two years ago.</p>
<p>Turkish newspapers published pictures taken at Sakik's camp in the mountains of Tunceli, showing Otas and the first bomber, Zeynep Kinaci, standing next to Sakik.</p>
<p>Otas was no stranger to the police. Security forces issued a statement on the Anatolian news agency late on Monday that they were searching for Otas and another woman guerrilla who had infiltrated Sivas town centre.</p>
<p>More than 21,000 people have been killed in fighting between the rebels and security forces since 1984.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Mehmet Agar criticised police in Sivas for failing to prevent the blast despite being on alert over Otas and catching her before ceremonies in the town for Republic day, a national holiday marking the foundation of Turkey in 1923.</p>
<p>&quot;They did not search her, and they unfortunately paid with their lives for such a basic mistake,&quot; Agar told Turkish television late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our team suspected the woman, but could not search her because there was no policewoman to do it,&quot; said a policeman in Sivas, a conservative town with a strong Islamist presence.</p>
<p>Police had detained Otas, dressed in black Islamic &quot;hijab&quot; women's clothing, after searching a minibus ahead of the fatal explosion.</p>
<p>Security officials in Tunceli said the interior ministry had issued a directive that women police and equipment for searching for explosives should be present at all security points in the region. And civilians should be searched not less than 200 metres (yards) away from military positions, the directive said.</p>
<p>The police officer in Sivas told Reuters by telephone that they also held a third rebel who escaped Tuesday's blast after being separated from Otas.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not had time to question him yet,&quot; he said. &quot;But I know that if they could have blasted the bomb during ceremonies, it would have killed at least 50 people. Our workmates died, they are martyrs now. They saved people's lives.&quot;</p>
