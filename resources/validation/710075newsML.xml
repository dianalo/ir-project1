<p>Russia's Uneximbank will take part in an investment tender for a 38 percent stake it manages in mining giant Norilsk Nickel group, a bank spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Uneximbank will take part in the tender,&quot; said Modest Kolyerov, head of the bank's press service.</p>
<p>Uneximbank said the tender would open on July 22 and close on August 1, with the winner announced on August 5. An official said it would probably be closed to foreign bids.</p>
<p>Kolyerov said Uneximbank was putting up for tender the stake which represents 51 percent of voting shares even though the bank hoped to buy it.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment Uneximbank manages the shares under the shares-for-loans scheme, but the tender is a continuation of the privatisation process,&quot; Kolyerov said.</p>
<p>The bank won control of the shares in the loans-for-shares scheme in 1995 when management control of government stakes in major companies was given in exchange for loans to the state.</p>
<p>The winner of the Norilsk tender must make a minimum investment of $300 million plus payments of social costs and debts owed by Norilsk to the state pension fund.</p>
<p>Up for tender are 47.88 million ordinary shares, each with a nominal value of 250 roubles, giving the stake a nominal value of 11.97 billion roubles ($2.1 million). The shares will be sold in one lot and will carry a starting price of 131.61 million Ecus.</p>
<p>Foreigners would probably not be allowed to bid, Uneximbank spokesman Sergei Chernitsyn said, because the 38 percent stake must be sold in a single lot and exceeded foreign ownership limits, which he said were 15 percent of the company.</p>
<p>Chernitsyn said the tender was designed to coincide with strong share prices, regular payments by Norilsk to its workers and to various budgets and rising base metals production.</p>
<p>&quot;We decided that now is the optimal moment to carry out the tender,&quot; Chernitsyn said.</p>
<p>Norilsk is one of the world's biggest producers of nickel, cobalt, platinum and palladium, and a major producer of copper. But the huge cost of supporting its social infrastructure have helped to drag the company into financial crisis.</p>
<p>Uneximbank, one of Russia's most powerful commercial banks, has struggled to implement a rescue package for Norilsk, a struggling Soviet-era group.</p>
