<p>Freight forwarders in Kenya on Tuesday started writing off perishable air cargo as air traffic controllers ended the fourth day of a go-slow which is crippling business at all the country's airports.</p>
<p>Flights from Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport continued to depart delayed as a backlog of cargo and passengers started to build up and air traffic controllers increased pressure on the government by doubling delays.</p>
<p>Airlink, an 85 percent-owned subsidiary of Swiss freight forwarder giant Kuehne &amp; Nagel, said it had been forced to write off some two tonnes of fresh cut flowers aimed for destinations in Taiwan and Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of these flowers have been waiting since Saturday morning, and we have lost all possibility of connecting flights from Johannesburg.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of them, about two tonnes, are too old and we will have to write them off,&quot; an official from Airlink told Reuters, adding that he did not know who would have to pick up the bill for the loss.</p>
<p>Industry sources in Nairobi estimated that the Airlink cargo load of two tonnes of cut flowers, mostly roses, had a value of $15,000 to $20,000.</p>
<p>Kenya produced over 90,000 tonnes of cut flowers, fruits and vegetables in 1996, of which more than 90 percent was exported by air.</p>
<p>Another major freight forwarder, who asked not to be named, said his company had a whole Boeing-747 freighter of flowers which because of the delays had been re-routed from Amsterdam to Luxembourg and now would miss the flower auction in Holland.</p>
<p>&quot;This is very bad,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;It's a very unhealthy situation we have out here at the moment and another problem is that because of the delays we now cannot get as much cargo on the routes as we want to, so we have a backlog of cargo building up.&quot;</p>
<p>The Airlink official said the company's own chartered freighter scheduled for departure Monday morning for Johannesburg still had not taken off by Tuesday evening, and if it failed to get underway on Wednesday morning Airlink would have to write off a second shipment of about three tonnes of flowers.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a great inconvenience to everybody and we wouldn't like to imagine how much we would have to write off if the go-slow continues until the end of the week,&quot; the official said.</p>
