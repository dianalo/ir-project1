<title>UK: Ban-busting Iran arms ship said heading for Libya.</title>
<headline>Ban-busting Iran arms ship said heading for Libya.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-02</dateline>

<p>An Iranian ship is expected to arrive in Libya over the next few days carrying arms and explosives in contravention of U.N. sanctions, Middle East shipping sources and Arab diplomats said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;This is in direct breach of the U.N. sanctions against Libya, imposed following the indictment of two Libyans for the destruction of Pan Am (flight) 103,&quot; a Lebanon-based diplomat told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>Official Libyan or Iranian comment was not immediately available.</p>
<p>In December 1988, a Pan American World Airways Boeing 747 crashed on the town of Lockerbie, Scotland, killing the 259 people aboard. Eleven people in Lockerbie were also killed.</p>
<p>Investigators said Flight 103 was blown up by a bomb. They blamed two Libyan security officials, and demanded that they face trial in the West. An air travel and arms embargo was imposed for Libya's failure to hand over the suspects.</p>
<p>Shipping sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the ship, the Iran Ershad, had made the long journey around South Africa's Cape of Good Hope on its way to Libya rather than the normal, much shorter route through the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>&quot;This avoided the customary and thorough inspection of the ship's papers and cargo by Egyptian port authorities (who control the canal),&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>The freighter was expected to dock in Tripoli sometime this week, he added.</p>
<p>The sources said the same vessel transited from Tripoli to Bandar Abbas in 1981, again using the Cape route.</p>
<p>Last year, they added, the Ershad was used as part of an attempt to ship two oil rigs from Iran to Serbia in violation of U.N. sanctions against Belgrade for its role in the 43-month Bosnian conflict.</p>
<p>The sources said they did not know if the oil rigs ever reached Serbia, but on March 14 Belgian authorities intercepted explosives and weapons, including a mortar, on board another Iranian vessel, the Iran Kolhadooz, at Antwerp.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe Iran has been transporting light weapons and ammunition through Kuwait to oppositionist groups in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states,&quot; the diplomat said. He did not give details.</p>
<p>In June, a truck bomb killed 19 Americans and wounded about 400 people at the al-Khobar military complex in Saudi Arabia, but so far, diplomats and analysts say, there is no evidence of foreign involvement in the attack.</p>
<p>The sources said they had no details of the arms the Iran Ershad is alleged to be carrying to Libya. The United States has accused Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi of building an underground chemical weapons plant, a charge Tripoli denies.</p>
<p>Sanctions against both Libya and Iran were tightened a month ago by U.S. President Bill Clinton, who signed a law penalising non-U.S. firms that invest $40 million or more a year in the oil and gas sectors of the two states.</p>
