<p>Democrat and Republican lawmakers from industrial states said they believed they could shelve the clean air rules endorsed Wednesday by President Bill Clinton in favour of five years of further research to see if they are needed.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an issue I can tell you, coming from western Pennsylvania, we'll go to war on,&quot; said Ron Klink, a Pennsylvania Democrat.</p>
<p>A number of Democrats said they would join Republicans in the House and Senate in trying to buck the president over the air regulations.</p>
<p>Representative John Dingell, Michigan Democrat, said 400 counties would be tagged as out of compliance with the new rules, potentially putting them at risk of losing highway funds and facing other sanctions.</p>
<p>Klink, Representative Fred Upton, Michigan Republican, and Senator Jim Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican, said opponents would try to block legislatively the new regulations on ozone and soot.</p>
<p>They also held out the possibility of denying funds to the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce the rules or invoking a law that allows Congress to override agency rules.</p>
<p>A strategy session was planned for early July.</p>
<p>Under the plan, major producers of smog and soot such as big power plants would be required to meet new lower standards and violators could be severely punished.</p>
<p>Congress will have 60 days to review the standards, which would be implemented for smog beginning in 2004 and for soot probably at some later date.</p>
<p>&quot;Ultimately, I believe we're going to have to have 67 percent of the house and Senate (to override a veto) to keep these ill-conceived and costly regulations from becoming law,&quot; Inhofe said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Upton said he believed there would be enough support to checkmate Clinton on the regulations, which were proposed last fall.</p>
<p>&quot;We anticipate very large support among Democrats,&quot; Dingell said at a separate news conference. He said 80 Democratic members of Congress had &quot;communicated&quot; earlier with Clinton on the matter.</p>
<p>Representative Bobby Rush, Illinois Democrat, criticised EPA administrator Carol Browner for persuading Clinton to support &quot;ill-conceived, ill-advised and ill-timed&quot; rules that would harm economic development.</p>
<p>&quot;She got out in front, playing the political game and boxed&quot; in the president, Rush said. &quot;That, to me, is being disloyal to the president.&quot;</p>
<p>Congressional critics said EPA proposed the rules without being able to accurately monitor air-borne particulates nationwide.</p>
<p>They said a five-year delay would allow EPA to deploy monitoring instruments and amass data on particulates and possible effects on health. EPA says the cleaner air could save 15,000 lives, a total that Klink and Dingell viewed as unsubstantiated.</p>
