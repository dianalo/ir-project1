<p>At sunrise every Friday hundreds of half-clad and sick children assemble at Dhaka's lush Suhrawardy Udyan park -- not to play, but to receive the one square meal they are guaranteed each week.</p>
<p>Most of the children sleep rough, but the luckier ones share shacks with their parents or friends in sprawling slums in the Bangladesh capital of nine million people.</p>
<p>None has any regular source of income and finding two meals a day is a full-time occupation.</p>
<p>&quot;They come from the darkest side of society,&quot; said Haji Mohammad Wajed, owner of Dhaka's renowned Ananda Bakery, who hosts the weekly food handout.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot feed them all but I try to help as many possible. I offer them Tehari (rice and beef cooked in vegetable oil). That gives them some protein, improves their health and brings a smile,&quot; Wajed told Reuters.</p>
<p>The food arrives at the park in large containers and is distributed quickly. Many children save a portion of their handout to take home to their families.</p>
<p>&quot;The food queue keeps getting longer,&quot; said Wajed, 50, who has been feeding the children for 2-1/2 years.</p>
<p>CHILD PROSTITUTION</p>
<p>The meal over, the children return to their daily grind, sometimes to help them in menial jobs such as breaking bricks at construction sites, or taking care of younger siblings while parents eke out meagre earnings as porters or rickshaw drivers.</p>
<p>Bangladesh does not have an official estimate of the number of child workers but independent surveys say children are working in 125 types of jobs.</p>
<p>They work in car workshops, collect garbage, shine shoes, sell waste paper and, worst of all, sell themselves for sex.</p>
<p>Many children lost their jobs after Bangladesh's garment factories bowed to pressure from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and importers, particularly the United States, and last year fired boys and girls under 14.</p>
<p>While some of them are going to schools funded by ILO and the U.N. Children's fund (UNICEF), many have turned to prostitution.</p>
<p>&quot;Their parents are too poor to pull them out of the filth and give them a decent life,&quot; said a police officer who declined to be named.</p>
<p>According to unofficial estimates, more than 10,000 girls aged between 10 and 15 are prostitutes in Dhaka and other cities throughout the country.</p>
<p>Police say it's almost impossible to know the exact number as most of the girls do not have homes.</p>
<p>Wajed wants to start an education programme for the children along the lines of the voluntary Under-priviledged Children's Education Programme (UCEP).</p>
<p>&quot;I have a dream that the children who come to me will learn to read and write,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe I will not be able to give them food indefinitely, but if they have education they will be able to find food for themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>UCEP was started in 1972 and has given formal education and vocational training to 18,000 boys and girls.</p>
<p>STATISTICS ARE FRIGHTENINGLY REAL</p>
<p>It has set up 30 schools exclusively for working children in a country where, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), 6.3 million children work.</p>
<p>While Wajed's educstion project may be a dream, the statistics are frighteningly real. The ILO says 43 million of Bangladesh's 120 million people are under 15. According to government figures, the literacy rate is only 30 percent. Annual per capita income is just $240.</p>
<p>Young Abul Kalam told Reuters of the opportunity UCEP had given him, even though it means he must work at a city home before and after school hours.</p>
<p>&quot;I am doing both (education and work) well. I want to become self-reliant ... with self-respect,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Suma Akhtar feels the same way. &quot;My life has already changed, thanks to UCEP,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>UCEP officials and Wajed say they were pursuing a common goal -- to save the children's future.</p>
<p>&quot;But despite our efforts many children get derailed and caught up in the shadowy world of vice,&quot; Wajed said.</p>
