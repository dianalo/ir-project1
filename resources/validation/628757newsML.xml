<p>The jury in the trial of alleged Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh deliberated for a second day on Saturday, trying to decide whether the Gulf War veteran is a cold-blooded killer or a man wrongly accused.</p>
<p>They were sifting through five weeks of testimony and hundreds of pieces of evidence presented during the trial of McVeigh, who was accused of blowing up the Alfred P. Murrah federal building on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people.</p>
<p>The wait for a verdict was already beginning to worry relatives of bombing victims, many of whom had hoped for a quick guilty verdict.</p>
<p>&quot;We're all on pins and needles. It's like a humongous rollercoaster. One minute you'll be laughing, the next minute you'll be crying. It hurts. We just couldn't perceive they would be taking this long,&quot; said Dan McKinney, whose wife Linda, 47, died in the bombing.</p>
<p>&quot;We're all kind of tensed up, waiting for a guilty verdict. If it doesn't come back by Sunday night, then maybe we've got some people on the jury trying to look at the evidence in a different way,&quot; said Charles Tomlin, whose son Rick died in the bombing.</p>
<p>But Denver attorney Andrew Cohen, who has been monitoring the trial, said he did not read anything into the length of deliberations so far because the jury had a lot of evidence to assess.</p>
<p>There was no indication how long the jury would take to reach a verdict.</p>
<p>If McVeigh is convicted, a second phase will be held to determine whether he is to be sentenced to life in prison or death. Asked if he were preparing for the so-called penalty phase, McVeigh's chief defence lawyer Stephen Jones would only say he was preparing for all eventualities.</p>
<p>Jones met with his client on Friday night after the jury concluded its deliberations for the day.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't go into what about we talked about except in a general way, but no, he did not express any concerns,&quot; Jones told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;He seemed to be doing fine,&quot; Jones said. &quot;I would say his spirits were upbeat and appropriate. We didn't dwell on what the jury might do, we just simply talked about the case.&quot;</p>
<p>Several hundred journalists kept watch at the federal courthouse in Denver, which was ringed by tight security as it has been throughout the high-profile trial.</p>
<p>The decorated former soldier, 29, pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy, bombing and first-degree murder of the eight federal agents killed in the blast.</p>
<p>The prosecution portrayed McVeigh as a right-wing fanatic driven to carry out the bombing by hatred of the government over the way federal agents handled a siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993.</p>
<p>The defence argued that authorities arrested the wrong man. The defence team, led by Jones, tried to discredit key prosecution witnesses, attack the reliability of the government's scientific evidence and undermine eyewitnesses who identified McVeigh as the man who rented a truck the government says was used in the bombing.</p>
