<p>Indian tobacco conglomerate ITC Ltd will report sharply higher profits for fiscal 1996/97 (April-March) led by robust growth in cigarette sales and improved margins, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Strong cigarette sales growth, expansion of margins and the possibility of lower write-offs would boost profits,&quot; said Sandeep Bhatia, ITC analyst at UBS Securities, the investment arm of Union Bank of Switzerland.</p>
<p>The results are due on Tuesday.</p>
<p>ITC is one of India's top 10 private companies. Britain's BAT Industries Plc hold 31.7 percent equity in the firm.</p>
<p>He forecast net profit to jump 41 percent to 3.67 billion rupees as the company is benefited from hiving off, or closing down, loss-making ventures.</p>
<p>Profit in 1995/96 had fallen to 2.61 billion rupees from 2.62 billion the year before, due to loss-making deals in farm products and global trade.</p>
<p>Analysts expect 1996/97 profits to reflect the strong margins in tobacco and cigarette sales.</p>
<p>Net profit forecasted by analysts range from 3.4 billion rupees to 4.0 billion rupees.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the results to be extremely good,&quot; said K. Ramachandran, analyst at Birla Marlin Securities. &quot;We are forecasting a net profit of 3.98 billion rupees.&quot;</p>
<p>He saw cigarette volume sales growth of 10 percent and margins rising 7.0 percent.</p>
<p>Mayank Khemka, research head at Calcutta-based brokerage C. Mackertich, said profits would depend on how the company accounts for excise claims which were under litigation.</p>
<p>ITC has made a deposit of 3.5 billion rupees against excise claims which the firm shows as current asset but could write-off, he said.</p>
<p>But Rajesh Mayani, analyst at HSBC Batlivala &amp; Karani Securities, said a write-off was unlikely so long as the case was still pending.</p>
<p>He expects a net profit of 3.4 billion rupees depending on how a restructuring of agro-businesses impacted the company.</p>
<p>Analysts do not expect the firm to announce a bonus equity issue though there have been rumours in the stock markets.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that a bonus issue and moreover in the ratio of 1:1 is unlikely,&quot; Mayani said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been bullish on the company without any expectations of a bonus, and an issue at this point would only further boost our confidence in the stock,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>ITC closed at 448.25, up 6.25 rupees on the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p>
