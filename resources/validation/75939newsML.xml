<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss bonds close higher, short end favoured.</title>
<headline>Swiss bonds close higher, short end favoured.</headline>

<p>Swiss bonds were up strongly at the close of trade, with the market boosted especially by demand in the short end.</p>
<p>&quot;There seems to be a general rally all over Europe. The short end is outperforming,&quot; said one dealer trading LIFFE's three-month Swiss franc contract.</p>
<p>He said the short end gained partly on perceptions that Germany may be more likely to trim interest rates further, in an effort to help other European countries meet criteria for joining the European Monetary Union, even if the German economy has little need of further monetary stimulus.  </p>
<p>Traders said the market saw such a move as more likely following a meeting of European central bankers and finance officials in Dublin last weekend.</p>
<p>Swiss francs were pulled higher along witht he rest of the market by the general positive tone, the trader said.</p>
<p>The short end was also helped by rumours the Fed was buying two year notes for a foreign central bank.</p>
<p>The trader added it was also possible investors who had been holding short-term liquidity, disappointed by lack of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve Tuesday, may have been forced slightly further out the curve into three-month maturities.  </p>
<p>Dresdner Bank set a 10-year 150 million Swiss franc foreign bond with a coupon of 4.50 percent priced at 102.70.</p>
<p>The issue was led by Dresdner and Credit Suisse.</p>
<p>Traders said the offering met moderate demand. One trader said the 10-year sector suffered from oversupply.</p>
<p>Swap rates were also lower, with one bank quoting 10-year swaps at 4.30/38 percent late in the session, down from 4.33/41 percent earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The December Conf futures contract revisted the contract high of 114.45 set on September 20 and closed just below that level.  </p>
