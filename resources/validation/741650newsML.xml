<p>No longer a hurricane, the weather system Danny continues to lose power and was downgraded Sunday to a tropical depression, U.S. meteorologists said.</p>
<p>But Danny's northerly drift into Georgia from north Florida was so slow that its heavy rains constituted a risk to some regions.</p>
<p>Moving steadily inland and now some 35 miles (57 km) north of Penasacola, Florida, Danny was likely to dump as much as 10 to 20 inches (25.4 to 50.8 cm) of rain over the next several days, forecasters said.</p>
<p>Its winds were less than 35 miles per hour (57 kph).</p>
<p>Forecasters lifted tropical storm warnings for the Florida Panhandle from Panama City to the Alabama border.</p>
<p>&quot;Radar and surface observations indicate that Danny has weakened to below tropical storm strength .... Heavy rain is still a serious threat,&quot; the U.S. Hurricane Centre in Miami said in an advisory.</p>
<p>Danny's status as a hurricane ended late Saturday, after the storm lashed the U.S. coastline with high winds and torrential rains as it followed a wavering path across the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Danny sat for nearly 12 hours Saturday at the southern portion of Mobile Bay and poured an estimated 20 inches (50.8 cm) or more of rain on parts of Alabama and Mississippi, the hurricane centre said.</p>
