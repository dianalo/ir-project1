<p>Placido Domingo, delayed by bomb scares and bedevilled by a sore throat, on Thursday got through his 25th anniversary celebrations at Britain's Royal Opera House on adrenalin alone.</p>
<p>Then, after winning a standing ovation from adoring Covent Garden fans, the 55-year-old Spanish tenor vowed he would keep on singing until the 21st century.</p>
<p>He must have been wondering if the Phantom of the Opera was going to strike as the script for his starring night could not have been more dramatically written.</p>
<p>First the gala was delayed 30 minutes by a bomb scare that forced Opera House patron Prince Charles to use the side entrance and left musicians stranded outside until the all-clear was given.</p>
<p>Then Domingo had to walk a vocal tightrope with a sore throat that almost forced him to pull out of a &quot;gold and silver gala&quot; celebrating 50 years of the Royal Opera company and 25 years of him singing at Covent Garden.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't think I was going to be able to sing tonight. But the adrenalin got me through,&quot; he told Reuters after the nerve- wracking night before 2,000 devotees who had paid up to 1,000 pounds ($1,650) each.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I was able to defend myself,&quot; said one of the world's most famous tenors after his bravura performance.</p>
<p>The bomb scare just added to the tension. &quot;That sort of thing makes you nervous. I didn't know whether the voice was going to last,&quot; he confessed.</p>
<p>Clearly on an emotional high after the gala celebration, Domingo told the audience: &quot;The last 25 years have been absolutely marvellous. I almost thought I couldn't sing tonight. I did the best I could.&quot;</p>
<p>That produced another round of cheers from the aficionados.</p>
<p>Domingo made his debut at Covent Garden as the Cavaradossi in a production of Puccini's &quot;Tosca&quot; in 1971. He has appeared at every Covent Garden season since then in a total of 20 different roles.</p>
<p>But his talents have not just been confined to the elitist world of opera.</p>
<p>He teamed up with Luciano Pavarotti and Jose Carreras for the hugely popular series of &quot;Three Tenors&quot; concerts that have brought opera to a much wider audience.</p>
<p>Now he has turned his talents to conducting which he did to much applause and acclaim in the second half of Thursday's gala before heir to the throne Prince Charles presented him with a silver &quot;long service&quot; medal.</p>
<p>But the rich and velvety voice of one of opera's finest actors is not ready to be silenced yet.</p>
<p>Domingo promised he would return when the Royal Opera House reopens in 1999 after a 200 million pound facelift that begins next July.</p>
<p>He refused to be tied down on a retirement date but did say: &quot;I hope I can sing into the 21st century.&quot;</p>
<p>Reflecting on a rollercoaster night for his voice, he concluded: &quot;Just a few more years singing and then I will conduct.&quot; $1=.6056 Pound)</p>
