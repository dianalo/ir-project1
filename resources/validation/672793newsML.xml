<title>JAPAN: Dollar seen mixed in Asia, eyes on Clinton.</title>
<headline>Dollar seen mixed in Asia, eyes on Clinton.</headline>

<p>The dollar is expected to be mixed in Asia on Friday, with market participants awaiting a news briefing by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in Denver for clues to dollar/yen direction.</p>
<p>The news briefing is expected sometime in the morning.</p>
<p>If it yields no surprises, the dollar could rise against the yen on short-covering, possibly above 115 yen, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Clinton's overnight remarks on the Japanese trade surplus were not that harsh,&quot; said a Japanese bank trader.  </p>
<p>&quot;Those who were betting on dollar fall ahead of the Denver summit may decide to square up if nothing new comes out from the Clinton-Hashimoto briefing,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>President Clinton, in a White House interview recorded with Japanese television before departing for Denver on Thursday, said he was concerned about Japan's large surplus with the United States but added that exchange rates should not be used to correct trade imbalances.</p>
<p>Dealers said their impression of the U.S. president was that he was less hawkish about trade imbalances than they had expected.  </p>
<p>The dollar ended higher against the yen in New York after the U.S. Commerce Department reported a smaller-than-expected U.S. trade deficit in April.</p>
<p>The trade gap in April was $8.36 billion, well below a $10 billion shortfall priced into the market but still larger than the downwardly revised $7.76 billion in March.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade issues may take the backseat after the Denver summit. People may start focusing on the Bank of Japan's tankan by next Monday,&quot; a trust bank trader said.</p>
<p>The &quot;tankan&quot;, the BOJ's key quarterly corporate survey, will be released on June 25.  </p>
<p>The dollar fell against the mark in New York on Thursday, after yen selling vaulted the mark above 66.00 yen.</p>
<p>Traders in Tokyo said that any further mark/yen rise may be limited as Japanese exporters have been looking for opportunities to sell marks.</p>
