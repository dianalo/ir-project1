<headline>Houston controller says tax vote hurt bond deal.</headline>

<p>A January 18 vote that could seriously curtail Houston's revenue raising ability cost the city money on a bond deal Wednesday, city Controller Lloyd Kelley said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody knew that the election in two weeks does not impact today's deal legally (and) it still doesn't matter,&quot; Kelley said. &quot;The fear that somehow this total effect will overall hamper the city's operations caused the market to move away from us.&quot;</p>
<p>Kelley estimated that overall the city paid four basis points more on the $382 million deal than it should have, with most of the added borrowing costs seen in the longer maturities.</p>
<p>&quot;On the short end it really didn't effect it that much... we did real well in the pricing there,&quot; Kelley said. &quot;But you could tell as you got out it certainly had an impact.&quot;</p>
<p>While the special election is commonly referred to as a tax limitation initiative what it really would do is limit the city's ability raise money through user fees, the controller said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm generally in favor of tax limitations, but we already have one that is an absolute. We have a (property) tax cap going back from '82 that's an absolute that the city has been at for a couple of years,&quot; Kelley said. &quot;What's ironic is this buys you nothing extra. Our tax cap was absolutely more rigorous as to taxes, but it left us free to do user pay.&quot;</p>
<p>Houston has sought to make a lot of its services such as golf courses self sustaining through user fees, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The impact is on that,&quot; Kelley said. &quot;I mean now you've tied the hands across the board.&quot;</p>
<p>If the intiative passes, future bond deals will be &quot;absolutely&quot; affected, Kelley said.</p>
<p>He added that the blame for the higher borrowing costs for Wednesday's deal rested on the upcoming election, not on senior manager PaineWebber Inc. The controller said he knows that the pending vote hurt the deal because both the deal's syndicate and potential buyers cited it.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm just unhappy when I know I have to pay more than I should,&quot; he said.</p>
