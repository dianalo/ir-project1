<p>Heavy gunfire echoed across the Congo capital Brazzaville despite an announcement by France of a cease-fire agreement by warring parties in the Congolese capital, residents said.</p>
<p>&quot;The firing is getting more intense, both from heavy weapons and small arms,&quot; one resident said on Monday night.</p>
<p>A broadcast on Brazzaville's main state radio frequency declared that the militia of former president Denis Sassou Nguesso controlled most of the capital.</p>
<p>Sassou Nguesso's followers have been fighting the troops of President Pascal Lissouba for five days in a political and ethnic conflict which exploded as the country approached a presidential election set for July 27.</p>
<p>&quot;Sassou's forces have repelled the forces of Lissouba and are controlling most of the city,&quot; said the broadcast. &quot;All police posts are under the control of Sassou.&quot;</p>
<p>The broadcast appeared to mean that the state radio building in the city centre had been captured by Sassou's militia but there was no direct confirmation of this and the frequency might have been used by another transmitter.</p>
<p>Earlier French President Jacques Chirac's spokeswoman said Chirac had received verbal agreement for a truce in telephone conversations with Lissouba and Sassou-Nguesso.</p>
<p>Chirac asked the two adversaries &quot;to decide on a cease-fire as soon as possible and accept the mediation of (Gabon President) Omar Bongo to seek a political solution and he obtained their agreement in principle,&quot; spokeswoman Catherine Colonna told reporters.</p>
<p>France, the former colonial power, on Monday sent more troops to Brazzaville, bringing the French force there to 1,200 men. The French military also airlifted more than 350 foreign nationals out of the embattled city.</p>
<p>The United States on Monday called for a cease-fire in Brazzaville and said it believed presidential elections could still be held on schedule on July 27.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe in very strong terms that the government and the rebel forces ought to agree to an immediate cease-fire and then to a restoration of the constitution as it was in power before the fighting broke out,&quot; the State Department said.</p>
<p>&quot;If there can be a cease-fire, and talks between the government and the rebel movement, it may still be possible to implement the presidential elections on the 27th of July,&quot; spokesman Nicholas Burns told a news briefing.</p>
<p>He said the United States was trying to reduce its current embassy staff of 28 diplomats to 15.</p>
<p>Burns said the U.S. embassy was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and some small arms fire over the weekend, but it was not thought the fire was aimed at the mission. He gave no indication of the extent of the damage.</p>
<p>He said about 200 private Americans were believed to be in Congo-Brazzaville, including some 75 in the capital.</p>
<p>Mayor Bernard Kolelas, a mediator in the conflict, called a truce from 7 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Monday as rival political and ethnic militias battled for a fifth successive day.</p>
<p>Bodies of dead fighters and civilians killed in crossfire lay untouched on the streets where they had been shot.</p>
<p>Fighters traded rocket fire, with one shell landing across the Congo River in Kinshasa, capital of Laurent Kabila's Democratic Republic of the Congo. It exploded harmlessly in the garden of a Nigerian diplomat, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Kolelas said a cease-fire would &quot;allow the putting in place...of conditions favouring a return to peace&quot;, international mediation and a buffer force drawn from parties implicated in the unrest.</p>
<p>&quot;The conditions for an intervention force are now in place above all with the presence in Brazzaville of troops from friendly countries which would not be able to allow Congo to sink into chaos,&quot; Kolelas said.</p>
<p>In 1993 more than 2,000 people were killed in clashes between political and ethnic militias in the capital following disputed parliamentary elections.</p>
