<p>Numb shock and disbelief hung over a quiet Frankfurt suburb on Christmas morning after a suspected suicide bomber killed herself and two worshippers at a midnight church service.</p>
<p>Residents of the industrial district of Sindlingen, some of them witnesses to the blast, found it hard to believe such a bloodbath could take place in a church on the night before Christmas.</p>
<p>&quot;I could never imagine something like this,&quot; said Marie-Doerr Schmidtling, 82, who was sitting with her family near the back of the church where the bomb went off. &quot;You don't feel safe anywhere anymore, not even in church.&quot;</p>
<p>Panic gripped the 70-strong congregation as the muffled explosion hurled shrapnel, splintered pews and oily black smoke through the church, she recalled.</p>
<p>Worshippers cried &quot;Get out, get out!&quot; as they scrambled for the exit to the South Sindlingen Protestant Church, a small stone structure in this industrial suburb west of Frankfurt.</p>
<p>There was no hint as to what drove the suspected bomber, a nervous-looking woman about 30 years old, to strap two grenades to herself and detonate them in the middle of a congregation that had come to celebrate the birth of Christ.</p>
<p>In addition to the mystery woman herself, two others were killed and 13 were injured, three of them critically.</p>
<p>Many churchgoers preferred to believe that the act was the committed by a lone, demented person rather than a terrorist.</p>
<p>&quot;I only hope the woman was, as the police said, a psychologically sick person who wanted to commit a spectacular suicide,&quot; said church deacon Burkhardt Sulimma.</p>
<p>Many residents of the drab suburb did not know the tragedy had struck until they turned on their televisions and radios on Christmas morning. Alone and in small groups, they came to the church and wondered what could have made someone do this.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did this woman go to such a crowded church if she wanted to kill herself? She could have done this anywhere,&quot; said Ulrike Schmidtling.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing like this has ever happened before,&quot; said Harold Limpke, who lives near the church but did not attend the service. &quot;I cannot understand where she got the material for a bomb in the first place.&quot;</p>
<p>A pair of teenage girls stood shivering in the cold, clear morning, staring quietly at the church with its massive leafless tree in the garden.  The front door was sealed.</p>
<p>&quot;Why on Christmas Eve?&quot; one asked her friend.</p>
<p>The still morning belied what had been a gruesome evening.</p>
<p>Small pieces of human flesh were splattered on the church's white walls, blood-covered body parts were scattered on the floor and many pairs of gloves lay abandoned on the floor.</p>
<p>Flying shrapnel had punched small holes in walls and windows. Near the altar, however, the large Christmas tree with its candles and gingerbread ornaments was untouched.</p>
<p>Police and emergency workers were still carrying pieces of bodies out of the church in plastic bags several hours after the attack, which attracted dozens of journalists, photographers and television crews.</p>
