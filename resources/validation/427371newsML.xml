<p>Istanbul shares posted losses in weaker volume on Friday as renewed political tension kept players on the sidelines ahead of the weekend, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100 closed 39 points, or 2.63 percent lower at 1,443 after recovering from an early low of 1,418. Over the week, it lost 10.5 percent after last week's three-point drop.</p>
<p>Trade volume slumped to 19.91 trillion lira from 38.96 trillion on Thursday.</p>
<p>Brokers said prices recouped part of the earlier losses in the afternoon in positive reaction to Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's words that the coalition government would continue and there would be no early elections.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a major recovery after Ciller's comments, but the index will drift at these levels for a while,&quot; said Hakan Catana from Pay securities.</p>
<p>Brokers said political uncertainty persisted amid stated government plans to ask for a parliamentary debate into planned measures against rising Islamist zeal and a call for early elections by a close aide to the Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is fully indexed to politics. The index may plunge to 1,300 levels if the government falls, otherwise it will be squeezed between 1,400 and 1,450 if uncertainty continues,&quot; said dealer Koray Cervatoglu.</p>
<p>Tension sparked by a row between the coalition's Islamist wing and the secularist army had eased after Erbakan signed a statement late on Wednesday from the National Security Council, urging action against rising Islamist militancy.</p>
<p>Erbakan's signing of the document had boosted purchases on Thursday when the index jumped 8.02 percent, after diving 14.9 percent in the first three days of the week.</p>
<p>Of the 238 shares traded, falls outdid rises sharply by 197 to 18 and 23 finished stable. The IMKB Industrial dropped 2.65 percent to 1,467, the IMKB Services dived 3.71 percent to 1,297 and the IMKB Financial shed 2.48 percent to 1,536.</p>
<p>Actives were led by readywear exporter EGS Dis Ticaret, up 750 lira at 23,750, utilities Aktas Elektrik, down 7,500 lira at 160,000 and Cukurova Elektrik, down 12,500 lira at 177,500, Raks Elektronik, steady at 36,500 lira.</p>
<p>They made up 27.4 percent of the total turnover.</p>
