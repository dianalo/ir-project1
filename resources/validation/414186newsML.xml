<headline>Iran features in wave of fresh sugar freight order.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>London's sugar freight market saw a raft of fresh inquiry at the start of the week but little was reported in the way of firmer business, shipbrokers said on Monday.</p>
<p>Middle East nations such as Iran were prominent among the quoted end-destinations as a result of the recent buying spree seen from Iran's Government trading Corporation (GTC).</p>
<p>Seven Seas was open on account for 3,500/4,000 tonnes of bagged sugar from Port Sudan to Red Sea/Gulf of Aden range for prompt/onwards shipment dates.</p>
<p>Louis Dreyfus quoted for 21,500 tonnes in bulk from Philippines to US west coast for 5/10 March or later.</p>
<p>As expected after Syria's buying tender last week, Lorico came into the freight market for 13,000 tonnes of bulk sugar min/max from Cuba to Syria for 15/25 March.</p>
<p>E D &amp; F Man issued a number of bagged orders with some of last week's still open.</p>
<p>It quoted for 12,000 tonnes from Immingham and Eemshaven to Iran for 17/21 March and a further 12,000 tonnes min/max from Thailand to Pakistan with option of Colombo for 18/25 March.</p>
<p>Man was also open for 6,000 tonnes min/max from Puerto Quetzal with option of east coast Mexico to Angola for prompt shipment dates.</p>
<p>Secretan launched various smaller bagged orders, mostly from European origins. It quoted for 1,500 tonnes from Antwerp to Tallinn for 15/19 March and 6/12,000 tonnes from Calais to Algeria for 24/29 March.</p>
<p>Secretan was also open for 2/3,000 tonnes from Thailand to east Africa for 15/30 March.</p>
<p>Lastly, Ceba Shipping issued an account order on an unnamed account for 14,000 tonnes min/max bagged sugar to be shipped from Bordeaux/Hamburg range to Iran for any March dates with 10 days notice.</p>
<p>In other news, Bangladesh was said to have bought one cargo of white sugar from a leading London trade house.</p>
<p>Sugar traders said the cargo was most likely to be Indian in origin.</p>
<p>Brazil's port of Paranagua was operating normally despite union claims that portworkers were working on a reduced basis and that loadings were already affected.</p>
<p>Port officials earlier said the port was operating normally and denied a union official's claim that the port was running at only 50 percent of normal capacity.</p>
<p>The Paranagua Unions Council said workers planned to strike from 1000 GMT on March 5 over demands for a 21 percent increase in wages which they say they did not receive last year.</p>
<p>Other Brazilian ports would then join the strike on March 6 out of sympathy.</p>
