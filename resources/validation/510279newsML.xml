<headline>Powers ask Russian trade freeze during WTO talks.</headline>

<p>The four major trading powers asked Russia on Tuesday to declare a freeze on any toughening of its foreign trade rules while it is negotiating entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p>Diplomats and trade sources said the call came from the United States, the European Union, Japan and Canada during a meeting of the WTO working party discussing Moscow's four-year-old bid to join the 130-member body.</p>
<p>In separate interventions, representatives from the four said Russia should proclaim a &quot;standstill&quot; -- effectively a pledge that it would not introduce new measures that could give it extra leverage in the negotiations.</p>
<p>EU envoy Herve Jouanjean told the meeting Russia should take &quot;no new trade restrictive measures&quot; while the talks were under way, according to the diplomats.</p>
<p>U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Dorothy Dwoskin said Moscow &quot;should move towards consistency with the rules of this (the WTO) house,&quot; while a Japanese official said Tokyo attached &quot;great importance&quot; to a standstill.</p>
<p>There was no immediate response from the Russian delegation to the session, headed by deputy foreign trade minister Georgy Gabuniya. But in the past Moscow has voiced reluctance to agree to take such a step.</p>
<p>The development reflected concern among many WTO delegations over what they see as lack of understanding among senior Russian officials and in some government ministries of what membership of the rules-based body would imply.</p>
<p>Last month, U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russia's President Boris Yeltsin agreed in Helsinki that they would aim for Russia to be admitted to the WTO next year. But some trade diplomats say that target may not be easy to meet.</p>
<p>In an apparent reference to this at Tuesday's session, the EU's Jouanjean said Brussels wanted to see Russia in the trade body but declared the negotiations were &quot;not a political exercise,&quot; according to the diplomats.</p>
<p>Trade diplomats said there was no reference at the meeting to a new &quot;buy Russian&quot; campaign launched earlier in the day by Yeltsin which was signalled in advance in Moscow on Monday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin was careful in a radio speech to the nation to say the government would not use administrative measures to limit imports and promote domestic goods at the expense of foreign products now flooding the Russian market.</p>
<p>&quot;But if Moscow were to start formally making difficulties for imports, that would be the sort of thing that would be barred by a standstill agreement,&quot; one trade envoy tracking the Russian WTO negotiations said.</p>
<p>The EU last November first asked Russia to take up a standstill commitment, saying it would ease the negotiations -- which diplomats say face a formidable task in the face of what they say is often contradictory Russian legislation.</p>
<p>China, which has been negotiating its own entry for a decade, has taken on a standstill commitment -- a point the EU has made already to Moscow.</p>
<p>But Russian officials argue that their case is different because -- unlike China -- their country has instituted political reforms and has a strongly independent parliamentary body which makes coordination of legislation difficult.</p>
