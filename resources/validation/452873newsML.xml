<p>Former prime minister Ray Robinson will be sworn in as Trinidad and Tobago's third President at 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, Information Minister Wade Mark said.</p>
<p>Robinson will take the oath of office from Chief Justice Michael De La Bastide at a ceremony to be witnessed by more than 1,000 invited guests at the President's House.</p>
<p>Robinson, a 70-year-old lawyer, succeeds Noor Hassanali, who retired at midnight after serving two five-year terms as president.</p>
<p>The new president, who was prime minister from 1986 to 1991, survived a coup attempt on July 27, 1990 when a group of armed black moslems stormed the Parliament Building, holding him and several government ministers hostage for six days.</p>
<p>He was shot and wounded during the insurrection, in which 24 people were killed, including a member of the military police.</p>
