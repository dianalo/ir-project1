<p>General Instrument Corp's move into digital cable television technology is a crucial step for the company as it carries out a planned restructuring, chief executive Richard Friedland said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are entering a number of new markets...but clearly the transition to digital cable is a very important strategic thrust for the company,&quot; Friedland said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>GI said it is showing its digital cable products at this week's National Cable Television Association trade show in New Orleans.  </p>
<p>&quot;We think it will begin in 1997 and it will be a major part of our business going forward,&quot; Friedland said.</p>
<p>GI announced in January that it would split into three separate companies, with its core set-top box business falling under a new company name, NextLevel Systems, with 1996 sales of more than $1.7 billion. Friedland will remain as chairman and chief executive of NextLevel.</p>
<p>Two other companies will be spun off -- CommScope Inc, which will provide cables, and Power Semiconductor, to supply rectifiers and voltage suppressors.  </p>
<p>Digital cable not only gives users more channels, including some in high-quality digital, but it also allows for a suite of extra services, including interactive on-screen programming guides and Internet connection.</p>
<p>Vice president of marketing for GI's digital network services, Denton Kanouff, said GI's systems, including the equipment used at the cable operators' central office and the set-top boxes, are designed with international standards. Digital cable television has the potential to carry 300 to 500 channels.  </p>
<p>&quot;If you have too many channels...there are new electronic program guides you can use that will help you navigate through that,&quot; Kanouff said.</p>
<p>Friedland said GI invested about $60 million in developing and marketing these systems in 1996 and expects to break even this year and be profitable next year with the systems.</p>
<p>Set-top boxes account for about 40 percent of the $1.7 billion in business to be included in NextLevel, he said. The company ships some six million set-top boxes a year, and of the five million used for cable TV, he expects one-fifth to be digital in 1997 and two-fifths in 1998.  </p>
<p>Friedland said GI expects some 12 million cable subscribers to have the option of GI digital cable by the end of the year.</p>
<p>But in the highly competitive and lucrative telecommunications network, Friedland said it is difficult to pinpoint which technology will be the definitive one.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very hard for us to see where this is all going -- are cable companies supplying telephony, are the telephone companies going to supply video, who is going to win the data wars between cable modems and XDSL (data subscriber line technology),&quot; Friedland said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our conclusion is we have the core copabilities to deliver video and data and telephony, and we're trying to be neutral as to who it is that wins, so that whoever does, we've got a strong position,&quot; he said.</p>
