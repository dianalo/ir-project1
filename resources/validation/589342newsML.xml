<headline>BASEBALL-MARLINS PLACE RF GARY SHEFFIELD ON DISABLED LIST.</headline>
<dateline>PITTSBURGH 1997-05-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Florida Marlins on Friday placed star right fielder Gary Sheffield on the 15-day disabled list with a sprained left thumb after the injury failed to heal as quickly as anticipated.</p>
<p>Sheffield injured the thumb diving for a ball in the sixth inning of Tuesday's 11-5 win at Atlanta and he was disabled retroactive to Wednesday.</p>
<p>The three-time All-Star originally was expected to play Friday night against Pittsburgh, but still was experiencing swelling and pain in the thumb Thursday.</p>
<p>Sheffield is now expected to return to action May 29 at home against the Colorado Rockies, the Marlins said.</p>
<p>Sheffield, who signed a six-year, $61 million contract extension, hit a two-run homer in the third inning of Tuesday's win. He is batting only .223 with five homers and 16 RBI in 38 games, but has walked 38 times.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old Sheffield missed three months of the 1995 season after suffering torn ligaments in his right thumb while diving for a ball.</p>
<p>He set career highs with 42 homers and 120 RBI last season, leading the National League with an on-base percentage of .465 while batting .314 with 142 walks.</p>
<p>Florida (23-16), which is already playing without injured centre fielder Devon White and reserve outfielder/first baseman Cliff Floyd, trails Atlanta (26-13) by three games in the National League East.</p>
