<p>Communist powers planted a church 'mole' in the Vatican in the 1970s who fed his Cold War masters reports of talks between the Pope and Western leaders, Germany's Tagesspiegel daily said on Friday.</p>
<p>The newspaper based its report on a still-unpublished report by the &quot;Gauck office&quot;, the authority appointed to examine documents left behind after unification by communist East Germany's Ministry for State Security (Stasi).</p>
<p>The infiltrator has not been identified but was &quot;run&quot; by Poland's SB secret service and was therefore probably a top Polish cleric in the Roman Catholic Church's administration, Tagesspiegel said in an advance release from Saturday's edition.</p>
<p>Some 260 pages of Stasi material uncovered so far included confidential memoranda on talks between Pope Paul VI and German &quot;Chancellor of Detente&quot; Willy Brandt, the French and English foreign ministers of the time and U.S. President Richard Nixon's personal envoy, Tagesspiegel said.</p>
<p>The report said it was not clear whether the church agent had also spied on the current Pope, John Paul II, who took office in 1978.</p>
<p>The newspaper said church historian Erwin Gatz had been despatched from Rome to Berlin to look at the documents and report back to the Vatican, but said Gatz himself had declined to comment.</p>
