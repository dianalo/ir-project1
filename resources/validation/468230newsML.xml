<p>The corporate bond high-yield sector ended a busy trading day off 1/4 to 1/2 point with Harvard Industries suffering the steepest loss, as its bonds tumbled 10 points, high-yield traders said.</p>
<p>Market players said Harvard bonds tumbled across the board on rumors, later denied, that the firm's efforts to sell its unit, Harman Automotive, had unraveled.</p>
<p>The company's 11-1/8's of 2005 were quoted off 10 points at 47 bid, 50 offer, traders said. The company's 12 percent bonds fell 10 points as well, they said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are still trying to put together a deal that the (buyer) can get financing for,&quot; said Richard Dawson, Harvard's senior vice president for law and administration.</p>
<p>Dawson said Harvard was still working with Salomon Brothers to complete the sale of its unit for $18 million to an undisclosed buyer.</p>
<p>Speculation that the deal had fallen through began when word circulated that a Salomon analyst - who was believed to have been prohibited from discussing the deal -- started talking to investors about Harvard, market sources said.</p>
