<p>Greece's socialist government will give the first hints of where sacrifices will be made in its belt-tightening 1997 budget after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, national economy ministry officials said.</p>
<p>The government wants the budget, which must go to parliament before the end of the month, to pave the way for participation in the EU's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) by the end of this decade or 2002 at the latest.</p>
<p>The full cabinet will discuss the budget on Tuesday and Prime Minister Costas Simitis and National Economy Minister Yannos Papandoniou are due to speak to reporters afterwards.</p>
<p>Simitis, elected to a four-year term in September, is likely to stress his commitment to EMU and his determination to meet targets aimed at aligning the economy with the rest of the EU.</p>
<p>&quot;The cost of non-participation in the EMU is huge,&quot; Simitis told the socialist party's central committee and parliamentary group on Monday. &quot;We can change Greece's image. The future is defined by us today.&quot;</p>
<p>Greece, the EU's poorest country, has been given a hard time by EU partners for years for lagging behind EU targets.</p>
<p>National Economy Minister Yannos Papandoniou is expected to announce that the 1997 general government budget deficit will fall to 4.2 percent of GDP from an expected 7.6 percent of GDP in 1996.</p>
<p>The budget deficit is projected to fall to 2.4 percent of GDP in 1998, well below the three percent of GDP called for in the Maastricht convergence plan.</p>
<p>The general government budget deficit has been on a downward trend, dropping to 9.2 percent of GDP in 1995 from 13.1 percent in 1994 -- mostly due to smaller central government budget deficits and some surpluses recorded by public entities.</p>
<p>According to media leaks, fiscal consolidation in 1997 will be based on boosting tax and non-tax revenues and freezing real spending.</p>
<p>Budget deficit reduction in 1997 will stem from a trillion drachmas ($4.2 billion) or more of high revenue growth of about 15 percent, and an increase in nominal expenditures of between six and seven percent.</p>
<p>Revenue rises are expected to come from direct taxes, with many tax breaks abolished, the non-indexation of the income tax scale for the fifth straight year and new taxes on real estate, interest on state securities and financial products.</p>
<p>A withholding tax of 7.5 percent will be applied to interest earned on new government securities effective early December or January 1997 and a 15 percent tax will be levied on financial products, the media leaks have said.    More indirect taxes will</p>
<p>be planned based on a stronger GDP growth likely to be set at 3.3 percent in 1997 from an expected 2.6 percent in 1996 and a yet another crack down on tax evasion.</p>
<p>Spending is expected to rise about six percent, about the same as projected average inflation. The wage bill will likely rise by about 8.5 percent and interest payments on public debt by much less.</p>
<p>Capital expenditures are expected to soar to about 30 percent to make sure that Greece absorbs all of its European Union funds and fuels economic growth.    ($1=237.6 Drachma)</p>
