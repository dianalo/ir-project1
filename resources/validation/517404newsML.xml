<p>Plastic products manufacturer Raychem Corp. lost more than 15 percent of its value Thursday, one day after the company warned that currency fluctuations would continue to pressure its results.</p>
<p>Raychem slumped $12.50 to $68.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Although it made some cautionary comments, the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company Wednesday reported that its profits rose to $68.4 million on sales of $427.8 million in its fiscal third quarter ended on March 31, up from year ago earnings of $41.7 million on sales of $417.8 million.</p>
<p>On Thursday a spokesman said the company was surprised to see its stock fall so sharply since the comments made in its earnings report were consistent with what it had said previously.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as we're concerned our prospects haven't changed,&quot; said spokesman Spencer Sias.</p>
<p>Raychem said in its earnings report that &quot;adverse movements&quot; in currency exchange rates lowered its income by about $5 million, and are expected to &quot;continue exerting downward pressure on near-term results.&quot;</p>
