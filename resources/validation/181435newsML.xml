<p>The ghosts who dwell near the site of this year's annual APEC ministerial meeting are angry, very angry indeed, and they want revenge.</p>
<p>&quot;They really want justice from the family of the Marcoses. They are the ones who killed them,&quot; Jocelyn Buenafe, a university lecturer and real-life Filipino ghostbuster, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Buenafe and some 40 other members of a group who call themselves &quot;Questors&quot; held a seance recently in the deserted former film centre to contact the spirits of workers killed there in an accident in 1981.</p>
<p>A still undetermined number of workers died when a scaffolding came crashing down on November 17, 1981, while work was on to complete the building in time for an international film festival, a pet project of then First Lady Imelda Marcos.</p>
<p>The corpses were not recovered for the proper funeral rites that are deeply important to Filipinos. The bodies were simply entombed in cement and work continued. The building was finished on schedule.</p>
<p>Filipinos, who treat their dead with reverence, still shudder at the callousness of this act.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like as a priority to give justice to the people who died here,&quot; Cultural Centre of the Philippines president Baltazar Endriga told Reuters.</p>
<p>Endriga is in charge of the complex of buildings overlooking Manila Bay which formed part of one of Imelda Marcos's biggest projects when she was governor of the Philippine capital and its surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The complex also includes the Philippine International Convention Centre, where foreign ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum will meet on November 22 and 23.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton, other Asia-Pacific leaders and top private sector executives will gather for a banquet there on November 24, the evening before the APEC leaders hold their annual summit in Subic Bay.</p>
<p>Philippine President Fidel Ramos is hosting the summit just over a decade after the Marcoses were forced to flee into exile by a popular uprising now known as the &quot;People Power&quot; revolt.</p>
<p>Imelda Marcos, who declined to be interviewed on the film centre, has steadfastly denied accusations that her family and associates looted the country of billions of dollars and plunged it into the economic pits from which it is now recovering.</p>
<p>Endriga invited the Questors, who are all associated with Manila's prestigious Ateneo University, to try to contact the dead so he could at least get their names for a plaque to commemorate them. Ideally, he would like to have the film centre demolished and the bodies exhumed.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to identify each one of them and return their bodies to their families so they can be given the dignity of a decent Christian burial,&quot; Endriga said.</p>
<p>He said there may be 30 bodies entombed in the film centre, which has not been occupied since a 1991 earthquake sparked off fears for its structural soundness.</p>
<p>The accident received only limited media coverage. President Ferdinand Marcos had imposed martial law and no mention of the tragedy was permitted by the time the film festival opened the following January.</p>
<p>Reporters who covered the accident believe, however, that there are only about 10 bodies.</p>
<p>Questors leader Tony Perez, who teaches psychology at Ateneo, says that however many bodies there may be, their spirits are so hostile that some do not want to communicate with the living.</p>
<p>Others who did all wanted to speak at once and made communication very difficult. &quot;They want an eye for an eye. They are very fixated on revenge,&quot; Perez said.</p>
<p>During the seance, the Questors split into three groups in different parts of the film centre's main theatre. Sitting around candles, they attempted to communicate with the dead.</p>
<p>Only Buenafe's group, in a dank tunnel right next to the spot where the workers died, reported any success.</p>
<p>Perez explained that Questors have varying degrees of sensitivity to the presence of spirits -- some may be extremely acute in picking up voices, others may see them.</p>
<p>Perez said the group's main goal was to give the spirits some peace so that they could move on &quot;to a higher level&quot;. The Questors do not want to encourage discussions about revenge.</p>
<p>&quot;One of our objectives is to teach them about forgiveness -- that no matter how hurt they were, or how great the pain, the greatest thing they can do is forgive,&quot; he said.</p>
