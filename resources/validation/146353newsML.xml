<p>New York City's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ended a year of speculation and gave Bob Dole the nod Saturday, saying he endorsed the Republican presidential candidate and would vote for him next month.</p>
<p>Giuliani, a Republican in a heavily Democratic city, made his choice known with Jack Kemp, Dole's running mate, at his side. The two men, longtime friends, met privately at LaGuardia Airport shortly after 6:30 p.m. EDT (2230 GMT).</p>
<p>After the announcement they went directly to Yankee Stadium with their families for the sixth game of the World Series, which the Yankees lead three games to two.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm voting for Senator Dole and Jack Kemp. I support them, and I'm going to urge other people to do that. I endorse them,&quot; Giuliani said.</p>
<p>Kemp thanked the mayor on behalf of the Dole-Kemp team and called the endorsement &quot;an act of statesmanship.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very strong signal from the mayor of the most important financial centre in this whole global economy. This sends a signal to governors and to mayors all over the country that Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are serious about our cities,&quot; Kemp said.</p>
<p>It was no coincidence that the two Republican politicians made the announcement before a bust of Fiorello LaGuardia, a popular Republican mayor of New York from 1934 to 1945 and the man for whom the airport is named.</p>
<p>Giuliani said that like many voters, he was making up his mind about whom to vote for in the last 10 days of the campaign. &quot;My endorsement is a very positive one ... I believe Senator Dole is the right person to be president,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Giuliani's eleventh-hour decision may lose a lot of its punch by coming before a critical World Series game. Political columnists said the mayor scheduled his announcement to make sure it did not get wide play in the news media.</p>
<p>In 1994 Giuliani, who is considered a renegade by local Republican leaders, angered many in his party by crossing over and endorsing Democrat Mario Cuomo for governor. Republican George Pataki won a surprise victory in that race and Giuliani has paid a political price for his disloyalty.</p>
<p>The mayor has also rejected the Republican Party's support for stricter controls on immigration, casting himself as the mayor of a city of immigrants.</p>
<p>In recent days some top local Republicans have distanced themselves from Dole, who is expected to lose New York state.</p>
<p>During his first political debate with President Clinton, Dole made a point of mentioning Giuliani's name twice in referring to his lowering of the crime rate in New York.</p>
