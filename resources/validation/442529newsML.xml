<p>President Ernesto Zedillo on Thursday slammed the United States Congressional vote attacking Mexico's drugs record, but said he would not retaliate yet, predicting U.S.-Mexico ties would weather the storm.</p>
<p>&quot;I am convinced that at the end of the day this issue will not have lasting consequences for our relationship,&quot; Zedillo said in an interview with Mexican television in Japan.</p>
<p>He drew a clear distinction between members of the U.S. House of Representatives who on Thursday voted to censure Mexico's anti-drugs efforts, and President Bill Clinton who he lauded as an unusually firm ally of Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;In the U.S. Congress we are hearing a series of opinions that are totally unfounded and sometimes frankly offensive for our country,&quot; he said, branding the attack mere &quot;rhetoric&quot;.</p>
<p>Mexico would only retaliate, he said, if Washington introduced laws that violated Mexican sovereignty. &quot;Of course, we are expressing our rejection of anything that could happen, but we cannot act too hastily,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He ruled out making any concessions to Washington to win a reprieve.</p>
<p>In its vote, the House said it would overturn Clinton's &quot;certification&quot; of Mexico for cooperating in the war on drugs unless he reports back within 90 days that Mexico has clearly improved its performance.</p>
<p>Such progress would include concessions from Mexico such as allowing U.S. anti-drug agents to carry arms while in the country, and speeding up extradition of Mexican drug traffickers to the United States.</p>
<p>He took pains to assure Mexicans that he would continue working with Clinton, whom he described as &quot;one of the most careful presidents in the history of that country in terms of his respect for Mexico.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton was scheduled to make his first state visit to Mexico in April. On Thursday he criticised the House vote, and Zedillo said he did not expect the issue to upset the trip.</p>
<p>&quot;I am confident that nothing will happen to affect the visit. I think it is important that we receive in our country President Clinton of the United States, and that we receive him as he is: A good friend of Mexico.&quot;</p>
<p>Zedillo was scheduled to return to Mexico late on Thursday after a four-day state visit to Japan.</p>
