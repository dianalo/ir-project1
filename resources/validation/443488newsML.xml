<p>Precious metals markets were steady and little changed on Friday afternoon as dealers stood by for the expiry of Comex traded options after the close in New York.</p>
<p>There was little reaction to a slightly lower opening on the New York futures as they reflected a recovery in the U.S. stock and bond markets following Thursday's fall.</p>
<p>&quot;The options players have gold in a stranglehold at the moment,&quot; one dealer said referring to the yellow metal's likely $350-$355 per ounce price bracket for the day.</p>
<p>The Comex April contract was down $0.80 at $353.70 after Wall Street opened higher on the back of a deeper-than-forecast fall of 0.4 percent in the February Producer Price Index.</p>
<p>At the 1500 GMT fixing, gold was valued at $352.80 per ounce against $353.00 in the morning which was just 10 cents up on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still a lot of uncertainty about direction,&quot; one dealer said adding that clues were unlikely ahead of the option expiry.</p>
<p>Some dealers saw the price coming off a bit next week before the market gathered steam for another try on the upside.</p>
<p>&quot;The upside has been quite thoroughly tested this week without making much of an impression,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers noted liquidity was readily available and sub one percent one month lease rates suggested most of the short positions in the market since early this year had been covered.</p>
<p>Silver was around a cent or two higher at $5.27/$5.29 having attracted what some dealers considered technically related fund buying on Thursday.</p>
<p>A &quot;golden cross&quot; has formed on silver's chart where the 50 day moving average has crossed the 200 day as both lines ascend.</p>
<p>&quot;It still looks pretty well capped around $5.32 and there is a problem with offers coming in at $5.30,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>A $5.25-$5.32 range was suggested for silver but if it broke out it could run up to $5.45, a dealer said.</p>
<p>Platinum and palladium were barely changed but some dealers felt they were running out of steam.</p>
<p>A report overnight said that U.S. car makers had not revised palladium purchasing plans despite the market's 37 percent rise since its low last November.</p>
<p>Palladium prices have held since Russia's Almaz export agency said this week it would probably begin exports for this year later this month.</p>
<p>Palladium was up $0.25 at $151.75/$152.75 and platinum unchanged at $382.00/$383.00</p>
