<title>UK: Dunblane parents plead to Major over gun ban.</title>
<headline>Dunblane parents plead to Major over gun ban.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Parents of children killed in the Dunblane school massacre last March pleaded on Tuesday with Prime Minister John Major to give their demand for a complete British ban on handguns a better chance of becoming law.</p>
<p>Six of them handed in a letter at Major's London office in which they asked him to allow Conservative legislators a free vote when the issue is debated in parliament next week.</p>
<p>&quot;Surely it is not too much to ask you...to allow your parliamentary colleagues the freedom to exercise their own unfettered judgment,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>But Major appeared determined to ignore the plea. He told a questioner in parliament: &quot;If you think the question of gun control is one that is appropriate for a free vote, I have to say to you I do not agree with you.&quot;</p>
<p>In the primary school gymnasium incident on March 13, crazed loner Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher.</p>
<p>Major plans to instruct Conservative MPs to back his proposal to exempt .22 calibre weapons from the ban provided they are kept securely in gun clubs for target shooting.</p>
<p>A bill to tighten gun control had its initial debate in parliament on Tuesday but the vote on the key issue of how much to limit handgun ownership is not expected until next Monday.</p>
<p>Major has a majority of just one seat in the House of Commons (lower house). A threatened rebellion by four Conservative MPs to vote with Labour and several minority parties for a complete ban is unlikely to prove decisive as nine Ulster Unionist legislators are expected to back Major's line.</p>
