<p>Denmark, whose voters initially rejected the Maastricht treaty in 1992, must almost certainly hold a new referendum on the outcome of EU reform talks, Economy Minister Marianne Jelved said on Monday.</p>
<p>Jelved, participating at the two-day summit of European Union leaders in Amsterdam which is due to conclude negotiations on a revised EU treaty, said it was a &quot;99 percent&quot; probability that Denmark would need to hold such a public vote.</p>
<p>&quot;But we have to wait to see the final text,&quot; she told Reuters, referring to the treaty text which is being negotiated by EU leaders.</p>
<p>Jelved added that such a referendum could be held in February or March next year.</p>
<p>Denmark, traditionally cool towards closer EU integration, threw the 15-nation bloc into chaos and confusion five years ago when its voters rejected the Maastricht treaty, which was agreed in the Dutch town of the same name in 1991.</p>
<p>The Danes accepted the treaty in a new vote the following year, but only after their government negotiated opt-outs from some of its key aims, including economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>The revised treaty expected to be agreed in Amsterdam is seen as much less far-reaching than the Maastricht treaty, which laid down the path towards EMU.</p>
<p>It is intended to help pave the way for eastern enlargement of the bloc, a key Danish priority, and also aims to create an area of &quot;freedom, security and justice&quot; in Europe.</p>
<p>Asked whether the likely outcome of the negotiations in Amsterdam would be so far-reaching that it would be hard to win the approval of the Danes, Jelved said: &quot;It is difficult to answer...we need a debate after the final text.&quot;</p>
<p>She stressed that a majority of the Danish people wanted the EU reform talks to facilitate enlargement, indicating this could be a factor in determining their views.</p>
<p>Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has repeatedly said Denmark's opt-outs would not be affected by the revised treaty.</p>
<p>But because of them, the country may have problems with proposals on common EU visa, immigration and asylum policies, EU diplomats say.</p>
<p>Further underlining the eurosceptical attitudes of many Danes, a Danish court started a hearing last month on a challenge to the legality of Denmark's EU treaties which legal experts say could end the country's EU membership under the present terms. A definitive verdict may not come until the end of 1997 or later.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs, a non-partisan group of 10 Danes, argue that since joining the EU in 1973, Denmark has ceded national authority to EU institutions in breach of its own constitution. But the centre-left coalition government believes its case is watertight.</p>
