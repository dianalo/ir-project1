<p>The Sri Lankan rupee closed at a low of 56.40 to the dollar on Thursday as speculators believed the Central Bank would let the local currency fall further, dealers said.</p>
<p>The rupee, which opened at 56.18 to the U.S. unit, ended at the day's low, which matched an all-time low reached on Monday.</p>
<p>Dealers said it was a volatile day, with speculator trying to drive the dollar upwards.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't see any genuine buyers in the market,&quot; a Hatton National Bank dealer said, refering to trade-related buying. &quot;The market went up and down as speculation was rife.&quot;  </p>
<p>The overnight call, which briefly reached 18 percent, ended at 16.5 percent, unchanged from Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Central Bank pushed down the dollar by only half a local cent in the morning despite its significant overseas loss overnight against the yen, dealers said. The bank's buying and selling prices were fixed at 55.6925 and 56.8176.</p>
<p>A local bank said this signalled that the central bank still wanted to see a weaker rupee. &quot;When they have to drop (the dollar) they do it only slightly. When they have to raise it, they raise it by several cents. This shows that devaluation is in progress,&quot; he said. -- Mohan Samarasinghe (941) 434319</p>
