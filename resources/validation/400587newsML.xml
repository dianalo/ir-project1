<p>Baton Broadcasting Inc. said on Tuesday it struck a deal to solidify its control of CTV, Canada's second largest television network.</p>
<p>Baton said it would pay C$10 million ($7.36 million) for Toronto-based CHUM Ltd.'s 14.3 percent stake in CTV and swap some Ontario television stations for several CHUM CTV affiliates in Canada's Maritime provinces.</p>
<p>Toronto-based Baton will end up with 57 percent of CTV if Canadian broadcast regulators approve the deal with CHUM, and Baton's acquisition late last year of Electrohome Ltd's. broadcasting interests and 14.3 percent CTV stake.</p>
<p>Baton is the broadcasting affiliate of one of Canada's wealthiest families, the Eatons.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this strategically accomplishes what we want to do,&quot; Baton Chief Executive Ivan Fecan said in a telephone interview after the CHUM deal was announced.</p>
<p>Fecan said acquiring control of CTV would allow for cost cutting at Toronto-based CTV.</p>
<p>Broadcast analyst Ben Dube at CrediFinance Securities Ltd. said: &quot;I think it's good for CHUM (because) it gives them geographical diversification, a better mix. For Baton, I think it's good because they are going to be the leader,&quot; said</p>
<p>The rest of CTV is owned by WIC Western International Communications Ltd., Montreal-based CFCF Inc. and  Winnipeg, Manitoba-based Moffat Communications Ltd., each with 14.3 percent.</p>
<p>Vancouver-based WIC would become CTV's second biggest shareholder under a deal last December to acquire CFCF's interest in CTV. The agreement is awaiting regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Under Baton's deal with CHUM, Baton/Electrohome Ontario television stations CFPL-TV London, CKNX-TV Wingham and CHWI-TV Windsor, and Baton's CHRO-TV Pembroke/Ottawa would be swapped for CHUM's CTV-affiliated stations in the Maritimes.</p>
