<headline>Dollar ends mixed in U.S. after official comments.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-15</dateline>

<p>The dollar surged above 1.80 marks on Wednesday to a nearly six-year high, but ended lower after German officials said the dollar had risen too far.</p>
<p>The greenback rose against the yen after a key Japanese official said the market was too optimistic about the yen.</p>
<p>The dollar initially rose to a peak of 1.8040 marks -- its highest since August 1991 -- on fresh signs that Europe's proposed single currency may be a weak one.</p>
<p>German research group HWWA cut its forecast for 1997 German GDP growth and said Germany's budget deficit would exceed the target for entry into the planned single currency.  </p>
<p>A Reuters survey showed European investors expect the euro to comprise a wide range of currencies, including many weaker units that would undermine the mark's status as Europe's leading currency, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The marketplace is saying the deutschemark is too high,&quot; said Mike Malpede, senior foreign exchange analyst at Refco Group, Ltd. &quot;Until we see what will be the monetary policy for the new European Central Bank, it's hard to instill any confidence in the deutschemark.&quot;  </p>
<p>But in New York trade the dollar fell when Bundesbank council member Franz-Christoph Zeitler told reporters in Germany that the dollar's rally may have become excessive.</p>
<p>Zeitler added that Germany wants a strong mark and German Finance Minister Theo Waigel later told Reuters the German cabinet will make a statement on Wednesday endorsing a strong mark and a strong euro.</p>
<p>&quot;Those comments seemed to drag the dollar down,&quot; said James Powers, vice president for corporate foreign exchange at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale.  </p>
<p>The dollar fell to 1.7930/40 marks from 1.7940/45 at the open, but rose to 115.74/79 yen from 114.38/43.</p>
<p>Profit-taking in dollar/mark actually began just before the late German comments and some dealers began to lose faith in the greenback's recent rally.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that we were unable to break 1.8030-35 was basically the reason why we came back. This might actually be the signal that this is the top,&quot; said Edith Wolf, head of currency sales at Credit Commerciale de France.</p>
<p>Wolf said she sees a possible period of consolidation between 1.7850 and 1.8035 marks.  </p>
<p>The dollar rallied in Asia when a news wire quoted Japan's vice minister for international affairs Eisuke Sakakibara saying market expectations of yen strength were too high.</p>
<p>Sakakibara also said G7 leaders would not use foreign exchange rates as a tool to manipulate trade flows.</p>
<p>&quot;If Japan can keep the dollar a little higher against the yen, perhaps Japan's recovery can become a little more solid,&quot; said Malpede.</p>
<p>The steady flow of offical German objections to the dollar's gains prompted concerns that monetary authorities might enter the market to support the mark.  </p>
<p>In fact, the Bank of Italy for the second straight day bought marks against the Italian lira, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The German comments are suggesting that they are starting to really watch this and that they don't want it to get away from them,&quot; said Anjum Sayyed, currency dealer at Manufacturers and Traders Bank.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the dollar rose to 1.4730/40 Swiss francs from 1.4717/22 and rose to Canadian $1.3700/05 from C$$1.3670/75. The British pound fell to $1.6783/93 from $1.6848/55. The Australian dollar fell to $0.7349/54 from $0.7358/68.</p>
