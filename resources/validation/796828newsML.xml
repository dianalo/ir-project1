<p>A Florida lobbyist who previously worked for Lazard Freres &amp; Co is cooperating in a federal investigation of a municipal bond deal in the Atlanta area, a consultant and friend said Wednesday.</p>
<p>James Eaton, a former Lazard banker and former campaign manager for U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, is president and owner of Tallahassee lobbying firm Capital Strategies.</p>
<p>He is prohibited from discussing the investigation but has asked a longtime friend and consultant, Ron Sachs, to help handle media inquiries.</p>
<p>&quot;Jim Eaton is actively cooperating in an ongoing federal investigation into a bond deal in Atlanta from the early '90s,&quot; Sachs said. &quot;It involves a deal that Lazard Freres was involved in in Atlanta.&quot;</p>
<p>Sachs added, &quot;I believe he is not the target of the investigation but he is fully cooperating. The government has asked him not to talk publicly about the case.&quot;</p>
<p>Sachs said he believed the investigation was being conducted by the U.S. Attorney's office in Atlanta.</p>
<p>John Davis, the chief of criminal investigations in that office, told Reuters, &quot;I cannot confirm or deny anything about that investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Lazard Freres, Kate McDonough, said the firm would have no comment.</p>
<p>Eaton left Lazard Freres in 1993 when he bought Capital Strategies from Bud Chiles, the son of Gov. Lawton Chiles. The firm handles government and public relations and is not involved in the municipal bond business, said Sachs, a media consultant and television producer who was previously Gov. Chiles' press spokesman.</p>
<p>Sachs described Eaton as &quot;a pretty good guy who's always done things the right way&quot; and said he did not believe Eaton was suspected of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Lazard Freres left the municipal bond business in December 1995.</p>
<p>Previously, municipal officials and others involved in bond deals in the Atlanta and Jacksonville, Fla., areas have said they received subpoenaes or requests from the Securities and Exchange Commission for documents from bond deals involving Lazard Freres in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The SEC has declined to comment and there was no indication whether the probe Eaton is involved in was related.</p>
