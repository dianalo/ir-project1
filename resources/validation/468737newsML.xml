<p>Middle East/West very large crude carrier (VLCC) rates dipped on Wednesday but held steady to most other destinations, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said the 280,000 tonne Macoma was snapped up at a soft W52.5 for a Mideast/U.S. Gulf-U.K./Cont voyage for KPC, loading April 24, well below the previous prevailing rate of W60.</p>
<p>&quot;There are not enough cargoes and more vessels after (April) 15,&quot; said a U.S. broker. &quot;I have seen three Korean relets, all modern tonnage, for April 20-25...The Macoma went very fast.&quot;</p>
<p>Mideast/Japan rates were unchanged at W67.5, with Mideast/Singapore also flat at W60/62.5, depending on vessel quality.</p>
<p>The West Africa VLCC market was quiet, but brokers said the rate remained around W72.5, with 130,000 tonners steady at W97.5 for an older ship and W102.5 for a modern vessel.</p>
<p>Cross-Mediterranean 80,000 tonne cargoes firmed to W140 from W120, while the 130,000 tonne sector was steady and quiet at W100. &quot;A lot of Aframaxes (80,000 tonners) have disappeared for Easter and there are a lot of cargoes,&quot; an Italian broker said.</p>
<p>Caribs/upoast 70,000 tonne crude, which has surged in recent weeks, appeared to have reached a plateau at W235/240, brokers said. &quot;It's as high as it has been for a couple of years, and I don't see it going much higher,&quot; one added.</p>
<p>But Caribs 50,000 tonne fuel oil cargoes firmed to W225 from W212.5 with owners prepared to pay out to move early cargoes, they said.</p>
<p>In the inter-U.K./Cont sector, Aframaxes were steady at W140, up some 25 points over the last three weeks.</p>
<p>Fuel oil in UKC edged down to W200 from W205 for 20,000 tonnes, while in the Med it was steady at W210.</p>
