<p>A single bullet from a suspected IRA gunman has killed a British soldier and brought Northern Ireland to the brink of renewed sectarian warfare.</p>
<p>The soldier was manning a checkpoint outside the southern village of Bessbrook and talking to a woman in a car when he was hit by a shot from a high velocity rifle, police said.</p>
<p>Bessbrook is the British army's helicopter base for patrols in so-called the &quot;bandit country&quot; of south Armagh where IRA snipers killed seven people before calling a cease-fire in September 1994 which they ended on February 9 last year.</p>
<p>The woman was slightly injured but the soldier was pronounced dead minutes later, the first fatality of the Northern Ireland conflict of 1977 and the first to die of a gunshot wound since before the IRA truce.</p>
<p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the British and Irish governments quickly blamed the Irish Republican Army (IRA) which has fought a 28-year war to oust Britain and reunite the province with Ireland.</p>
<p>Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said: &quot;The IRA campaign is anti-Irish and contrary to the interests of all in Ireland.&quot;</p>
<p>The killing, the first since the IRA bombed Britain's Northern Ireland army base at Lisburn, outside Belfast, last October, killing one soldier and injuring 30, put intense strain on a cease-fire by their Protestant Loyalist foes.</p>
<p>Loyalists, so-called because of their allegiance to Britain, have officially stuck by an October 1994 cease-fire but have warned that if the IRA kills anyone they will go back on the warpath.</p>
<p>They killed hundreds from the Catholic community, from which the IRA draws support, to avenge IRA attacks in a conflict which has killed a total of 3,200 including hundreds of IRA victims.</p>
<p>Garry McMichael, whose Ulster Democratic Party is close to one Loyalist group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, said the shooting made nonsense of claims by the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, that it wants to be involved in a peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;What we have here is a demonstration of Sinn Fein's so-called peace strategy. This time what we must do is focus on trying to salvage the situation....&quot;</p>
<p>He urged a security crackdown against the IRA, which has carried out bomb attacks every week this year in an attempt to force Britain to invite Sinn Fein to peace talks without preconditions of an IRA cease-fire.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe it is time for the British government to accept its responsibilities to protect citizens of Northern Ireland and to meet the IRA threat directly,&quot; he told the BBC</p>
<p>Security sources believe the IRA is trying to cause mayhem in Northern Ireland so that whatever British government wins elections due by May has to act decisively to get Sinn Fein to the negotiating table.</p>
<p>But neither Prime Minister John Major, nor his likely successor, Tony Blair, have shown signs of backing down on demands that the IRA end its war for good in order to be accepted into negotiations with Protestant leaders who want to stay British.</p>
<p>Britain's 18,000 troops in Northern Ireland have been on high alert since the IRA ended a 17-month truce one year ago, accusing Britain of blocking Sinn Fein's path to the talks.</p>
