<title>FRANCE: Algerian forces block opposition rally on violence.</title>

<p>Algerian security forces on Sunday prevented leading opposition politicians from staging a rally to demand dialogue with outlawed Islamists and an end to bloodshed in the North African country.</p>
<p>The opposition had earlier threatened to defy a government ban on street protests by staging a rally. Instead, they avoided a confrontation and carried out a peaceful march and laid a wreath near the site of a car bomb that killed 42 people last week.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the authorities drew a security belt in and around Belcourt district in central Algiers where the rally and wreath-laying ceremony was expected to take place.</p>
<p>They cordoned off the area, blocking traffic with the aim of preventing protesters from reaching the bombing site, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;They (protesters) managed to reach Belouizdad avenue to lay a wreath some 50 metres (yards) away from the bombing site,&quot; said one resident who took part in the protest. He was speaking by telephone from the Algerian capital.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people, led by opposition leaders and human rights activists, took part in the march, he said.</p>
<p>Residents reported no arrests or incidents during the march, organised by the Signatories of Peace Call -- a group of politicians which groups representatives of several opposition parties, including the main secular opposition Socialist Forces Front (FFS) as well as prominent figures, including writers, intellectuals and former ministers.</p>
<p>The Peace Call group wants a dialogue established between the opposition, including moderate leaders of the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), and the government to end the civil strife which has killed more than 60,000 people since 1992.</p>
<p>In a speech on Friday, President Liamine Zeroual assailed the country's legal opposition for having a hidden agenda of surrendering Algeria to Moslem guerrillas who according to newspapers have killed more than 250 people this month.</p>
<p>Zeroual also attacked the legal opposition for hiding behind &quot;the calls for peace... calls whose sole truth lies in an invitation to the Algerian people to resign themselves to assassination, destruction and hegemony.&quot;</p>
<p>The Peace Call group says hundreds of thousands of Algerians back its goal of healing the country's wounds through a peaceful solution.</p>
<p>The opposition was barred on Saturday by security forces from laying a wreath at the bombing site in Belcourt where 42 people died last week in a car bom explosion.</p>
<p>&quot;The authorities want to keep for themselves the monopoly to denounce terrorism,&quot; one politician commented on the ban.</p>
<p>The government also ordered independent newspapers on Saturday not to play into the hands of &quot;terrorist propaganda&quot;.</p>
<p>Algerian authorities have draconian powers over the press but independent papers have walked a tightrope in giving details of killings, uncleared by the authorities who until recently repeatedly said only &quot;residual terrorism&quot; remained.</p>
<p>Algeria's main independent dailies all reported more killings in the conflict which broke out five years ago after the authorities cancelled a general election dominated by the Islamic Salvation Front.</p>
<p>Le Matin said more than 250 people had been killed in the two weeks since the start of the Moslem holy month Ramadan on January 10.</p>
<p>In that period, bombs have blasted Algiers and other cities and residents have independently reported the slaughter of entire families, including infants, in isolated communities.</p>
<p>Zeroual told the nation in a televised address on Friday: &quot;Innocent citizens, of all categories, are victims each day of a blind terrorism never equalled in other times or other places.&quot;</p>
<p>The president said the government would wipe out the guerrillas responsible for the latest violence, thought by newspapers to belong to the ruthless Armed Islamic Group (GIA).</p>
<p>The opposition says Zeroual's policy has simply failed.</p>
