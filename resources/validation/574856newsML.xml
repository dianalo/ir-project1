<p>The centre-right opposition bloc took control of Italy's second city Milan in local elections on Sunday, but just failed to win a knife-edge mayoral race in the country's other leading northern industrial centre, Turin.</p>
<p>The Freedom Alliance bloc, led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, also missed out in the northeastern port of Trieste to the ruling Olive Tree coalition, but was buoyed by its victory in wealthy Milan and gains in some southern areas.</p>
<p>&quot;The political message is clear -- centre-right forces are growing and the Olive Tree is drying up,&quot; said Rocco Buttiglione, head of the small centrist CDU party, which lies within the Freedom Alliance.</p>
<p>However, Prime Minister Romano Prodi's year-old government breathed a sigh of relief that it held onto two of the three top northern cities despite unpopular tax hikes aimed at securing Italy a place at the launch of the single European currency.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, this is a positive result for the centre left,&quot; said Leonardo Domenici, spokesman for local affairs in the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the largest single party in Prodi's administration.</p>
<p>Sunday's elections involved run-off races for 77 mayors and five provincial presidents between the two front runners in places where no one gained more than 50 percent support in the first round vote on April 27.</p>
<p>The Freedom Alliance and Olive Tree each won four of the 10 largest cities up for grabs, while the other two were taken by the separatist Northern League party, which bounced back from serious first round losses, including that of Milan.</p>
<p>Freedom Alliance candidate Gabriele Albertini, head of the metal industry employers' group, was chosen as the financial capital's new mayor with 53.1 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>His rival Aldo Fumagalli took 46.9 percent after he refused to sign an electoral pact with the hard-left Communist Refoundation party, which lies outside the government but secures Prodi's majority in the lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Turin, home of car giant Fiat, the centre-left candidate Valentino Castellani decided to link up with Refoundation after the first round ballot left him trailing a poor second in the wake of the centre-right.</p>
<p>The decision paid off, with Castellani scrapping home in the second round run-off by less than one percentage point.</p>
<p>Centre-right politicians said this proved that Prodi needed Refoundation support to survive, but his Olive Tree coalition was swift to point out that it managed to win three cities, including Trieste, without hard-left backing.</p>
<p>In the seven other largest cities which held local elections on Sunday, the centre-left won Ancona and Novara, while the centre-right won Catanzaro, Crotone and Terni.</p>
<p>The Olive Tree coalition received a boost in the provincial elections, winning in three of the five races. The overall turnout was 67.7 percent against 75.4 percent on April 27.</p>
<p>The Northern League won the cities of Lecco and Pordenone -- boosting the spirits of the party's firebrand leader, Umberto Bossi. &quot;League support has managed to hold up in a difficult moment,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
