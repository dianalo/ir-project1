<p>Britain's Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) on Friday went on the offensive against a predator that has been stalking it for months, firing off a court order to thwart a hostile bid.</p>
<p>Guernsey-based Lanica Trust admitted it was on the brink of launching a takeover for the 153-year-old funeral parlour to bank mammoth, which sources close to the company said was likely to total 1.0-1.5 billion pounds ($1.6-2.4 billion).</p>
<p>London's High Court had earlier on Friday ordered Lanica, its 31-year-old head Andrew Regan and an offshoot firm called Galileo to disclose any confidential information they have about CWS and explain for what purposes it had been used.</p>
<p>CWS said the court order also applied to Allan Green, one of two CWS executives suspended on Thursday for an alleged breach of trust.</p>
<p>CWS said the suspension of Green, controller of retailing, and David Chambers, chief general manager for buying, marketing and supply chain, &quot;arose from a suspected recent serious breach of trust&quot;.</p>
<p>In February, Lanica approached CWS to buy its non-food businesses and speculation has since focused on CWS's profitable Co-operative Bank as one of the main targets.</p>
<p>But in a statement late on Friday Galileo said it wanted to convert the CWS into a limited company and then offer to buy the whole business.</p>
<p>CWS, whose activities range from supermarkets and funeral parlours to insurance and banking, has a complex ownership structure seen until now as a major obstacle to any takeover or break-up attempt.</p>
<p>The group, based in the northern English city of Manchester, is owned by local co-operative societies which in turn have individual members.</p>
<p>Co-op rules mean they are not allowed to make a profit on their holdings, which cost a pound.</p>
<p>Entrepreneur Regan has given little away about his game-plan since the February announcement and shares in Lanica have been suspended since the two sides squared up.</p>
<p>Regan has appointed Hambros Bank to advise on his bid, although the British bank declined any comment. SBC Warburg has been retained by CWS.</p>
<p>Regan's attempt to break-up the CWS is seen as the result of recent poor performances by the multi-billion pound turnover co-operative group, which on Monday reported a fall in 1996 pre-tax profits.</p>
<p>&quot;After the CWS results it was logical that he (Regan) would have to make his move sometime this week,&quot; one source told Reuters.</p>
<p>On Monday CWS chief executive Graham Melmoth reiterated the group's stance of not selling any of its businesses to &quot;an asset-stripping middleman&quot;.</p>
<p>Melmoth said it was questionable whether Lanica's shares, which have been suspended since February 10, would ever be relisted.</p>
<p>The shares were star performers during 1996 and were suspended at 19.5 pounds each.</p>
<p>In any case, analysts believe that CWS's complicated ownership structure will dog any bid.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no obvious mechanism for a hostile bid for the Co-op to proceed because of its complicated structure,&quot; said one, who declined to be named.</p>
<p>But they did not discount the possibility that a way around this obstacle could be found, or that others might not be encouraged to take a close look at CWS's other businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;If Regan gets to the stage where he makes a formal offer, he won't get past first base. But it might flush out some other contenders,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome, the Co-op will have to take drastic action to improve its performance.</p>
<p>&quot;What it does do is put pressure on the Co-op. It knows it has to do something.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts suggested that this would include cutting the number of individual societies from a current 51 to one or two and consolidating its wide-ranging business interests.</p>
<p>&quot;But the Co-op wants to decide what (to sell) and to whom,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
