<title>JAPAN: Tokyo naphtha prices higher on crude rally.</title>
<headline>Tokyo naphtha prices higher on crude rally.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1996-12-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tokyo naphtha prices were firmer in afternoon trade on Tuesday, lifted by an overnight crude rally in New York, traders said.</p>
<p>Bids for first-half February open-spec naphtha were heard at $231.00, with offers at around $233.00. On Monday, it was traded at $228.50.</p>
<p>Second-half February was quoted at $228.00/$229.50, up from late Monday's $224.75/225.75.</p>
<p>In spreads, first-half February/first-half March was assessed at plus $5.50/6.00. Second half January/second-half February was bid at plus $7.00 with no offers having surfaced.  </p>
<p>In physical naphtha, Japanese importers are poised for second-half January trading, with first-half requirements largely satisfied, traders said.</p>
<p>First-half January cargoes were mostly sold at $6.00 to $8.00 over the mean of Japanese quotes, they said.</p>
<p>Spot availability for January cargoes remained tight due to ongoing annual term talks between South Korean suppliers and Japanese buyers, traders said.</p>
<p>Producers in South Korea are expected to start offering January spot cargoes after the term negotiations are concluded, they said. -- Tokyo Energy Desk +81-3-3432-8837</p>
