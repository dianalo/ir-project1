<p>French President Jacques Chirac faces a tough task to restore public confidence in his stumbling conservative government when he gives a rare 90-minute television interview on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Beset by record 12.6 percent unemployment, sluggish economic growth, seething labour unrest, corruption scandals in his own Gaullist party, privatisation problems and uncertainty over a future European single currency, the president has no obvious good news to announce to his gloomy countrymen.</p>
<p>His aides have ruled out a change of government, despite Prime Minister Alain Juppe's record unpopularity, and discounted an institutional initiative such as a referendum, suggesting his aim will be to explain policy better rather than to change it.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't expect sensational revelations...but I do think he could usefully restore confidence, just as he created confidence during the presidential election,&quot; Regional Development Minister Jean-Claude Gaudin said in a radio interview.</p>
<p>It is the first time Chirac has addressed the nation since July 14, except for a brief statement vowing to fight terrorism after last week's Paris metro bomb. So expectations are running almost as high as the level of public discontent.</p>
<p>Most analysts forecast a &quot;stay the course&quot; message in which Chirac will try, as he did in July, to convince voters France is on the right track and must persevere with painful modernisation if it is to stay in the major league of world powers.</p>
<p>Even before he goes on screen, Chirac is under fire over the choice of five relatively inexperienced journalists to question him rather than better-known heavyweight political interviewers.</p>
<p>Jean-Michel Thenard, political editor of the left-wing daily Liberation, quipped that Chirac had chosen to reshuffle his interviewers rather than changing his government or policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it reasonable to allow the president to pick the journalists who are going to question him on television? Should he be allowed to define the shape of the programme on which he appears...That's not how modern democracies work,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>Since he has chosen to speak on the eve of the Dublin European Union summit, Chirac seem bound to try to convince sceptical voters that a single European currency will help promote growth and jobs, and that the pain of budget cuts to qualify for it is worthwhile.</p>
<p>Public support for European economic and monetary union has been eroded by charges that the economy is being stifled by pegging the franc to the deutschemark, an argument lent new credibility by ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing's recent call for a depreciation of the French currency.</p>
<p>But Chirac has rejected any breaking of the franc-mark link and is expected to spell out his belief that a single currency will eventually put the Europeans on an equal footing in the world economy with the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>Another major theme is expected to be the need for France to adapt its generous social system to meet growing international competition, while protecting the core of the welfare state.</p>
<p>Conservative politicians and employers have launched a debate on the need for greater flexibility in the rigid labour market, but the government faces fierce resistance to any attempt to change French working habits or rights.</p>
<p>And recent strikes by truck drivers, Corsican fishermen and Toulouse bus drivers have shown how far the Juppe administration is prepared to concede new social rights such as retirement at 55 and new cash handouts to buy off labour unrest.</p>
<p>Finally, Chirac is bound to face embarrassing questions on a wave of judicial investigations into alleged covert Gaullist fundraising by shaking down public works contractors in his 18 years as mayor of Paris. He has sought to play down the issue so far by saying all parties had broken the rules in the past.</p>
