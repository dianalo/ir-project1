<p>The overnight interbank rate was unchanged at 6.00/10 percent as the market remained liquid on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the market was easy as borrowers remained cautious after the maturity of a Bank Negara deposit on Monday.</p>
<p>Earlier, short-term interbank rates eased after the fall in the overnight rate on Monday, which indicated availability of ample liquidity in the system, the dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the one-week interbank rate fell to 7.00/20 percent against 7.40/50, two-week declined to 7.10/20 against 7.40/60 and one-month was at 7.20/25 against 7.20/30.</p>
<p>Three-month interbank rate was quoted at 7.25/30 percent against 7.28/33 and six-month at 7.28/32 against 7.30/35.</p>
<p>&quot;This fall in rates is mainly due to the fall in overnight on Monday. That showed the market there was money around,&quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>The overnight rate slipped to 6.0 percent on Monday against 8.0 percent on Friday as liquidity improved.</p>
<p>Dealers said term rates should have fallen on Monday, but the market was cautious after a 500 million ringgit Bank Negara bill maturity on Friday failed to move interest rates.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange (MME) gained in line with the fall in the interbank rates, futures dealers said.</p>
<p>At 0845 GMT, spot month December contract rose by one point to 92.78, or an implied yield of 7.22 percent.</p>
<p>Next year's contracts were all higher. March rose by one to 92.95, June gained two to 92.95, September was up seven to 93.29 and December was six points higher at 93.32.</p>
