<p>The U.S. Agriculture Department said it was inviting offers for about 12.3 million pounds of dairy products for February delivery in a bid to cut federal spending by taking advantage of lower market prices.</p>
<p>USDA said it was also seeking offers for January delivery of print butter, March delivery of processed cheese, and March and April delivery of mozzarella cheese.</p>
<p>&quot;This action by CCC (Commodity Credit Corp) to procure additional cheese for later delivery periods should help the nation's dairy producers by removing additional product from the market at this time,&quot; Farm Service Agency administrator Grant Buntrock said in a statement.</p>
<p>    PRODUCT			  DELIVERY PERIOD     POUNDS</p>
<p>    natural american cheese	 February	  279,980</p>

<p>    mozzarella cheese		 March	     766,080</p>
<p>    mozzarella cheese		 April	     524,160</p>

<p>    process cheese		    February	1,413,600</p>
