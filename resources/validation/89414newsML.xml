<headline>HCIA stock crumbles after profit warning.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The stock of HCIA Inc. crumbled in heavy trading Tuesday, a day after the health care information company said weak revenues would drag its earnings well below analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>The stock fell $28.25 to $31.75 on Nasdaq, where it was the most active issue in late morning trading.</p>
<p>Late Monday, Baltimore-based HCIA said it expected earnings per share of 10 cents to 15 cents, before a one-time $41.2 million charge, in the third quarter, and around 15 cents to 20 cents a share in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>That was well below analysts' forecast of 29 cents a share for both quarters, according to First Call.</p>
<p>HCIA, which develops and supplies clinical and financial information systems for the health care industry, reported a loss of $327 million, or 4 cents a share, on revenues of $16.5 million in the second quarter ended June 30.</p>
<p>HCIA said it did not meet its third-quarter revenue goals, mainly due to a shortfall in its Commercial Markets group, which serves larger customers in the pharmaceutical, medical device and supply, employer, and consulting firm markets.</p>
<p>Analysts at Merrill Lynch and Alex. Brown downgraded the stock, although Alex. Brown later returned to a strong buy rating, citing HCIA's precipitous fall.</p>
