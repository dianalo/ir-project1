<p>ValuJet Inc will have to cope with higher costs and tough new competition from Delta Air Lines Inc and Southwest Airlines Co when it returns to the skies, analysts say.</p>
<p>Three months after its grounding, the one-time darling of Wall Street won a final fitness order from the U.S. Department of Transportation on Thursday, clearing the way for five ValuJet DC-9s to begin scheduled flights next week.</p>
<p>&quot;They could be back on Monday,&quot; said Steve Lewins, an analyst at Gruntal &amp; Co.  </p>
<p>While news of the long-awaited approval drove ValuJet's stock up 2-5/8 to 12-7/8 in frantic Nasdaq trading, analysts said the new airline will have some new obstacles.</p>
<p>For one thing, it is expected to operate under tight scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration, which was sternly criticized earlier this year for the size and scope of alleged safety violations discovered at ValuJet after the May 11 Florida Everglades crash that killed 110 people.</p>
<p>Analysts say that could make it hard for ValuJet executives to move from five planes to 15 within 30 days of the startup.  </p>
<p>Before its grounding in mid-June, ValuJet's legenday low cost structure was a nightmare for full-service carriers such as Delta, which also is headquartered in Atlanta.</p>
<p>The green light to ValuJet came only five days before the startup date for Delta's new low-cost carrier, Delta Express, which will begin service with 25 Boeing Co. 737-200 aircraft flying daily nonstop service from 10 northern cities to Orlando and four other destinations in Florida.</p>
<p>Florida, a prime market for ValuJet in the past, also has been seeing the encroachment of low-cost service from Southwest Airlines.  </p>
<p>The competition would be expected to force ValuJet into more aggressive promotions which, analysts such as Lewins believe, could keep a lid on the yield from revenues.</p>
<p>Greater attention to maintenance, imposed by the expected scrutiny of FAA inspectors, also would be expected to raise unit operating costs.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, ValuJet was said to have achieved a unit cost of 6.95 cents per available seat mile.</p>
<p>&quot;Unit costs probably will be hefty when the airline returns to the skies -- perhaps in the eight-cent-per-available-seat-mile range,&quot; said Lewins.  </p>
<p>Lewins raised his rating on ValuJet stock to neutral from underperform on Thursday in expectation that final DOT approval would soon be forthcoming.</p>
<p>He said the stock should be viewed as a trading opportunity for &quot;highly aggressive&quot; investors.</p>
