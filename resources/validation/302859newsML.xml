<title>MALAYSIA: Missing Singapore politician said in Hong Kong.</title>

<p>A Singapore opposition politician has gone to Hong Kong after fleeing to Malaysia saying his life had been threatened, a Malaysian politician said on Monday.</p>
<p>Workers' Party member Tang Liang Hong was accused by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of being a &quot;Chinese chauvinist&quot; during Singapore's election campaign two weeks ago, in which Tang was a candidate.</p>
<p>Tang and his daughter had received threats following Goh's accusations, he and the Workers' Party said.</p>
<p>Tang lost in the no-holds-barred election campaign that halved the opposition presence in Singapore's 83-member parliament from four seats to two.</p>
<p>Malaysia's national Bernama news agency quoted Parti Rakyat Malaysia (Malaysia Peoples' Party) politician Abdul Razak Ahmad as saying: &quot;He (Tang) contacted me from Hong Kong today and said he would be there for about a week.&quot;</p>
<p>Abdul Razak said Tang was preparing &quot;documents and evidence&quot; to rebut accusations made against him by Goh's People's Action Party.</p>
<p>Abdul Razak said Tang, whom he has known for more than 30 years since they studied law together, wanted to &quot;expose everything&quot;.</p>
<p>Last week, Singapore police urged Tang to help them with their investigation. A police statement said Tang had not handed over one of two threatening letters.</p>
