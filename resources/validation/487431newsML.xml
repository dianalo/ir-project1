<p>A long-awaited rate hike, a favorable high court decision and action in Congress show Brazil's plan to privatize its $100 billion telecommunications industry is moving ahead nicely, analysts said.</p>
<p>This week's flurry of activity, matched by gains in Telebras stock, means the government may yet meet its target of privatizating cellular services this year followed by bigger sell-offs in 1998, they said.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's been a lot going on and everyone's much more optimistic about the timing,&quot; said Unibanco telecoms analyst Joao Miyashiro.</p>
<p>The first good news for the government this week came Wednesday when the Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF) ruled the Communications Ministry could regulate the telecommunications industry while an official regulator was still being set up.  </p>
<p>The STF has yet to rule on the constitutionality of four other articles of an interim telecommunications law which the government introduced in 1996 as a legal framework for privatizing B Band cellular services.</p>
<p>But the regulator issue was considered the biggest potential pitfall in the way of the B Band program, the first stage of Brazil's huge telecommunications privatization plan.</p>
<p>At least a dozen international consortia were due to submit bids for ten regional B Band concessions April 7 which are expected to raise about $5.0 billion in license fees.  </p>
<p>Analysts said even if the STF strikes down the interim law, the impact may be softer than once feared because a definitive and wide-ranging General Telecommunications Law is making swift progress in Congress.</p>
<p>A first rewrite of the bill was presented to a committee in the Chamber of Deputies Thursday with few changes.</p>
<p>The committee is expected to vote on the new legislation in the week starting April 21. A vote on the floor of the Chamber of Deputies could take place before the end of April and the government hopes the bill will be through the Senate by June 30.  </p>
<p>&quot;The law is advancing faster than the market and even the government expected,&quot; said analyst Miyashiro.</p>
<p>Communications Minister Sergio Motta told reporters Wednesday the rules for privatization of Telesp, the Telebras subisidiary covering lucrative Sao Paulo state, and long-distance carrier Embratel, could be ready by early 1998.</p>
<p>Many analysts had previously predicted the government would not be able to start the privatization of Telebras' non-cellular assets before 1999.  </p>
<p>Thursday's announcement of a long-awaited telecommunications rate hike was seen as another sign the government was keen to privatize sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Although the 3.1 percent hike was lower than expected, a sharp increase in charges for local calls and in the basic monthly rate for residential users eliminated cross-subsidies from Telebras' rate structure, paving the way for competition.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing was forcing the government to announce this hike now,&quot; said Flemings analyst William Laurent. &quot;It is a clear sign they want to make progress.&quot;</p>
