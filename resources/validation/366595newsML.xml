<p>Serbia's opposition warned the pro-democracy movement of &quot;blood, sweat and tears&quot; ahead although parliament is expected to endorse its election victory on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are facing a long hot spring and summer and a fight against those who have not surrendered, those who regard their own people as a foreign element,&quot; opposition leader Zoran Djindjic told thousands of his supporters in Belgrade.</p>
<p>The feeling was shared not only by thousands who demonstrated, according to the opposition, in 70 other towns across Serbia on Monday evening but also by the West.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright personally urged President Slobodan Milosevic to ensure disputed election results are reinstated and to open a dialogue with his political opposition, the State Department said on Monday.</p>
<p>A parliamentary legislative committee had approved a Milosevic-inspired draft law recognising the disputed poll results ahead of a vote by the house on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The parliament is expected  to swiftly approve the bill reinstating opposition victories in 14 of Serbia's biggest cities, including Belgrade, in November 17 municipal elections the ruling Socialists fraudulently annulled.</p>
<p>But sceptical of Milosevic's sincerity, the opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition and its student allies plan to keep up their marathon daily demonstrations at least until their mandates are officially verified in about 10 days time.</p>
<p>Djindjic cautioned that it was just the  beginning of an arduous fight to restore democracy in Serbia.</p>
<p>&quot;We face great challenges and much more difficult stages of the race than the one we covered in these 80 days,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There is speculation that legislation would reduce the already meagre powers of local councils by stripping them of their sources of revenue.</p>
<p>State department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Albright's message to Milosevic was &quot;quite tough&quot;, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;The only result that will satisfy the United States is if the people who won the Nov. 17 elections actually take their seats and have sufficient powers to do their job -- meaning the powers haven't been stripped away in some back room deal, which is another option that we've heard about, another option available to the anti-democrats in Belgrade.&quot;</p>
<p>The British ambassador to Yugoslavia, Ivor Roberts, visited the student leaders and gave them two personal computers.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a democratic deficit in the region and without democracy we are not going to see a stable Serbia and a stable region. We... try to do what we can to rectify this problem. We will support the democratisation of Serbia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Roberts' show of support for the students was another blow to Milosevic who once enjoyed wide international support after the Dayton peace accord he helped engineer ended the war in Bosnia in December 1995.</p>
<p>Now the West has turned against the autocratic president. France hosted the three Zajedno leaders last week, prompting an outcry by the state media.</p>
<p>The United States has deliberately snubbed its one-time reliable negotiating partner.</p>
<p>Djindjic said Milosevic had no intention of surrendering, but only of consolidating his position. &quot;They will try using all possible ploys to get back what they lost,&quot; he said.</p>
