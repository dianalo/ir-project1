<p>British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind cautioned France and Germany on Monday against boosting cooperation within the European Union without consulting other member states.</p>
<p>Britain insists that all countries must approve any plans for a vanguard of EU members to forge ahead faster than others.</p>
<p>Paris and Bonn have proposed writing a broad flexibility clause into the EU's treaty, with no country permitted a veto on others' plans to pool sovereignty.</p>
<p>&quot;What is controversial is the suggestion that a group of European countries could decide on further integration within Europe without the agreement of the other member states,&quot; Rifkind told a news conference in Paris.</p>
<p>&quot;If they wish to integrate within the EU, that means they will have access to EU institutions -- the Commission, the Court -- and these belong to all EU countries,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Rifkind's trip to Paris followed visits to Stockholm and Bonn to spell out Britain's increasingly isolated and sceptical position within the EU.</p>
<p>A meeting with his French counterpart Herve de Charette was cancelled because the latter had to leave for Israel earlier than planned, officials said.</p>
<p>In an interview in the daily Le Monde published on Saturday, de Charette said France and Germany hoped their European partners would agree to allow some EU members to proceed more quickly than others in some areas.</p>
<p>&quot;But I will not accept a clause preventing us from acting without the unanimous agreement of the others. In this case, these areas of cooperation will take place apart from the EU and its treaties,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rifkind insisted that the basic criteria for judging proposals for more integration within the EU should be the impact on prosperity, jobs and the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;If countries want access to EU institutions, that is a matter for all 15 countries, and that is what five or six countries are saying today,&quot; Rifkind said. &quot;That is why the EU has survived for so many years.&quot;</p>
<p>He also urged member states to launch a debate on which areas were not suitable for more integration.</p>
<p>&quot;So far there has been a yawning silence when countries are asked to explain which areas are not suitable for integration. Until those limits are identified, there will be concern that an agenda for a federal Europe is being pursued in some quarters.&quot;</p>
<p>In a speech to the French Institute of International Relations, Rifkind appealed for support from France to prevent further erosion of the power of national governments and parliaments by creeping federalism in the EU.</p>
<p>He said Britain would not accept any EU decision on foreign affairs or immigration achieved by majority voting that fundamentally affected its national interest.</p>
<p>In a clear warning ahead of June's EU summit, which will map out the future shape of the EU, Rifkind indicated that the Maastricht treaty of 1991 fulfilled Britain's immediate needs.</p>
<p>&quot;We see it as a durable and well-judged response to the ambitions, but also to the concerns of our citizens which are deeply held and long lasting,&quot; Rifkind said.</p>
