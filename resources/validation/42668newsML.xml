<p>Big foreign investment banks have shown interest in the privatisation fund of Bulgaria's powerful business grouping Multigroup, its president said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Big investment banks have shown great interest in our privatisation fund and our plans related to it,&quot; Ilia Pavlov told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;At a further step (of the mass privatisation) they (the banks) could join us as business partners and time will say when,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pavlov said that among the banks were Merrill Lynch, Morgan Grenfell and Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>The Multigroupelit fund, projected to take part in Bulgaria's mass sell-off programme, has attracted 120,000 shareholders, mostly young and well-educated, he said.</p>
<p>The fund, which has a founding capital of 500 million levs, has collected vouchers from the population worth 2.5 billion levs and is in the top ten of the 96 registered privatisation funds, Multigroup officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is to show the confidence of the people in the only private company among the top 10 that is not backed by state-owned giants and is not using old state symbols,&quot; Pavlov said.</p>
<p>Multigroup, one of a small handful of powerful firms to have sprung up in Bulgaria amid the legal and administrative chaos that followed the collapse of communism, has sometimes attracted negative publicity.</p>
<p>The interests of Multigroup, the Bulgarian branch of Liechtenstein-registered Multiinternational Holding Ltd, range from oil and gas distribution in the Balkans to trading raw materials such as metals and sugar.</p>
<p>The group's vice-president Radoslav Nenov said Multigroupelit would take stakes in plants that it already has experience of.</p>
<p>The grouping, which has offices in New York and Washington, plans to acquire stakes in state-owned chemical, metal and oil companies and also in the food industry, agriculture and tourism.</p>
<p>Multigroup clashed with the government earlier this year over the size of its stake in a Bulgarian-Russian joint gas stock company, Topenergy.</p>
<p>The first mass privatisation tenders are due to begin in October and Multigroupelit will hold its founding shareholders' meeting on September 23. -- Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-84561</p>
