<p>The head of New Hampshire's Republican Party has agreed to pay a $100,000 fine to settle federal charges alleging his development company was involved in fraudulent condominium sales in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Stephen Duprey pleaded guilty on behalf of Northeast Community Development Group in February to nearly two dozen counts of filing false statements on bank loan documents.</p>
<p>While admitting his company's employees engaged in illegal practices, Duprey denied that he and other executives knew of the improper activity.</p>
<p>&quot;Our company was negligent and I was sloppy ... and I accept responsibility for that inattentiveness,&quot; Duprey said after the sentencing Monday in U.S. District Court.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors said the company engaged in &quot;gifting&quot; during 1988 to sell units at a Rochester condominium project. The illegal practice involves inflating sales prices and down payments from buyers to help them obtain larger loans and easier financing.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Peter Mullin recommended a $75,000 fine and told Judge Joseph DiClerico that the government decided to charge the company rather than individuals such as Duprey, because of &quot;uncertain&quot; evidence.</p>
<p>DiClerico accepted the guilty plea, but hiked the fine to $100,000. He also demanded that Duprey pay $4,400 to reimburse the government's costs incurred during the investigation.</p>
<p>After the hearing, Duprey blasted the government for pursuing the investigation after his company had been alerted to problems and corrected them. He called the investigation a &quot;witch hunt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After having barely survived the real estate depression without going bankrupt, we simply have no more resources left to fight. I have expended over $175,000 defending myself and the employees of Northeast. The government, with limitless resources, could go on forever,&quot; Duprey said.</p>
