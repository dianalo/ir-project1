<p>After a week of wild daily fluctuations ARA fuel oil bunkers were broadly steady on Wednesday, with little change elsewhere in Europe, dealers said.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 CST was quoted at $98/100 fob after one U.S. trading house sold into the barge market at around $97/$98 fob ARA. Traders said another trading house was rumoured bidding up the market late in the day.</p>
<p>Enquiries increased slowly through the day, but the total traded volume was not large.</p>
<p>&quot;Rotterdam is not the cheapest. The U.S. Gulf looks better for buyers. Suez is not a bad alternative,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Hamburg prices were also little changed. Traded volume was very low.</p>
<p>Traders said buyers were more encouraged by Rotterdam prices and Germany would probably have to fall in line.</p>
<p>Mediterranean prices were also steady. Volumes in most locations were low, although buyers in Spain launched a few enquiries.</p>
