<headline>Florida court denies reputed mobsters bail.</headline>
<dateline>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla 1996-12-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>A judge Monday denied bail to Nicholas &quot;Little Nick&quot; Corozzo, the alleged head of New York's Gambino crime family, saying he was a danger to the community and government witnesses.</p>
<p>Two other alleged Gambino associates were also denied bail by Broward County magistrate Barry Seltzer and were to remain in custody. All three men entered not guilty pleas.</p>
<p>Corozzo, 56, was arrested on racketeering charges last Wednesday as he sunbathed on a south Florida beach.</p>
<p>He and eight &quot;members and associates&quot; of the Gambino family were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges they ran a criminal enterprise called the South Florida Crew, a branch of the Gambino family involved in loansharking and stolen property, prosecutors say.</p>
<p>In a five-hour hearing, defence lawyers argued that Corozzo, Ralph Davino, 53, and Salvatore Pecchio, 46, should be granted bond.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Lother Genge presented transcripts of phone calls and wiretaps to give an outline of his case.</p>
<p>Joseph Corozzo, Nicholas Corozzo's nephew and lawyer, said the allegations that his uncle is the ruling member of the Gambino crime family are false. He says his uncle is in the landscaping business.</p>
<p>A 20-count indictment alleges the group was running a loansharking operation from a business called E-Z Check Cashing Inc. in Deerfield Beach, Florida.</p>
<p>The indictment also accused some of the defendants of trying to torch a print shop and conspiring to murder an associate suspected by the Gambino family of skimming money from its south Florida operations.</p>
<p>The defendants face sentences of 20 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 on each count, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>The New York Daily News reported earlier that reputed Gambino leader John Gotti, jailed for life, had agreed to turn over the reins of the family to Corozzo to avert a mob war.</p>
