<p>U.S. drug czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey made a surprise visit to Mexico City on Wednesday as controversy swirled over Washington's decision last week to &quot;certify&quot; Mexico as an ally in the U.S. war on drugs.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy declined to give any details of McCaffrey's visit beyond confirming that he had arrived.</p>
<p>Local Radio Red quoted Mexico City airport sources as saying McCaffrey had arrived with eight aides and that his visit would touch on a wide range of topics.</p>
<p>A spokesman at Los Pinos, official residence of President Ernesto Zedillo, said McCaffrey had not been there, denying a rumour that he had already met with the Mexican leader.</p>
<p>Washington &quot;certified&quot; Mexico's antinarcotics efforts on Friday despite opposition from critics of Mexican drug corruption.</p>
<p>Embarrassments have abounded for Mexico in recent weeks, including the firing and arrest of McCaffrey's Mexican counterpart Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo on charges of drug corruption, the escape from custody last week of an alleged drug cartel leader and allegations by the New York Times and Mexican magazine Proceso of drug corruption in high places.</p>
<p>Mexican police succeeded in arresting the acting head of the Mexico Gulf cartel, Oscar Malherbe de Leon, just as the debate about certification was at its height.</p>
<p>The government did not release news about the escape of Malherbe's alleged sidekick Humberto Garcia Abrego until after Mexico had won certification, however.</p>
<p>Garcia is the brother of the imprisoned Gulf cartel leader, Texas-born Juan Garcia Abrego, who is serving 11 life sentences in a U.S. jail after being caught in Mexico in January last year and deported.</p>
<p>Time magazine reported at the weekend that Mexico intended to scrap its current anti-drugs agency, the National Institute for Combatting Drugs (INCD), and replace it with another modelled after the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).</p>
<p>Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar said on Tuesday that the INCD was riddled with problems but denied that it would be turned into an institution similar to the DEA.</p>
<p>(U.S.) President (Bill) Clinton's decision to certify Mexico drew strong criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. Resolutions to overturn the certification have been introduced in the Senate and are being considered in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Clinton could veto such a resolution if it passed Congress and it would then need a two-thirds majority in both chambers to take effect.</p>
