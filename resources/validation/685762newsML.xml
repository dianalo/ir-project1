<p>Peru's Congress President Victor Joy Way lashed back on Wednesday at U.S. ambassador Dennis Jett for his criticism of the government's purchase of a fleet of Russian-made MiG-29 warplanes.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides being impertinent for getting involved in internal affairs, it reflects a high ignorance of what is happening in the country,&quot; said Joy Way.</p>
<p>&quot;These comments are unfortunate, totally out of place, and far from what the Vienna Convention says about non-interference in internal affairs.&quot;</p>
<p>Jett criticised the Peruvian government on Tuesday for last year's purchase of the planes, saying the money should instead go to social services.</p>
<p>But Joy Way, also a leading member of the ruling Change 90-New Majority movement, defended the government's social record, saying 50,000 new classrooms had been built and more than 5,500 schools equipped since Fujimori came to power in 1990.</p>
<p>&quot;The only objective of this purchase is to reestablish the balance of power by replacing obsolete or damaged equipment,&quot; Joy Way told reporters. &quot;Peru is in no way a country that is instigating arms races.&quot;</p>
<p>Jett also expressed his concern that the purchase might spark an arms race in an already unstable region.</p>
<p>The President of Congress' defence committee member, Gilberto Siura, insisted, however, that Jett's remarks &quot;will not affect relations between Peru and the United States, because they are personal comments.&quot;</p>
<p>Jett, appointed here in August 1996, has increasingly irked the government in recent weeks by voicing his opinion on various internal matters including the dismissal of judges from the highest constitutional court, the torture of an intelligence agent and freedom of media.</p>
