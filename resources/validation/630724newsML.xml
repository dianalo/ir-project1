<headline>Gore unveils plan to ease small business pensions.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON</dateline>

<p>Vice President Al Gore announced steps Monday to help small businesses, including a campaign to make it easier for them to offer retirement plans.</p>
<p>In a ceremony to celebrate the 34th annual National Small Business Week, Gore unveiled a five-point programme to help small businesses develop pension plans for their more than 32 million workers who now lack retirement benefits.</p>
<p>The programme, developed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Labour Department, includes a toll-free hotline number at 1 800-998-7542 and three Labour Department publications that will describe simple pension options.</p>
<p>The five-point plan is geared largely to informing small business owners about the Savings Incentive Match Plans (SIMPLEs), similar to Individual Retirement Accounts, that they may offer their employees without having to apply the anti-discrimination tests that make 401(k) retirement accounts more cumbersome to administer.</p>
<p>&quot;We are targeting small businesses, especially those with 100 or few employees, for one reason. They comprise a large segment of the U.S. employee population,&quot; Labour Secretary Alexis Herman said in a telephone news conference.</p>
<p>SIMPLEs, which were enacted last year as part of laws to raise the federal minimum wage, allow workers to make up to $6,000 a year in pretax contributions to a tax-deferred account. Employers must contribute 2 percent of an employee's salary or match employee contributions up to 3 percent of employees' annual pay.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no question about it that most small businesses want very much to offer retirement benefits to attract top quality employees,&quot; said SBA Administrator Aida Alvarez.</p>
<p>The five points call on small business owners to learn about pension options, consider establishing a plan, encourage employees to participate, match employee contributions and educate employees about their pension options.</p>
<p>Assistant Labour Secretary Olena Berg said there were no precise estimates on how many small businesses offer pension plans now, but it is believed to number in the thousands.</p>
<p>Gore also announced a delay of electronic tax filing requirements for small business and a new SBA one-stop online procurement service, called PRO-Net, to enable small business -- especially small businesses owned by women, minorities or the disadvantaged -- to more easily find procurement opportunities in the federal government and private sector.</p>
<p>During the ceremony at the Old Executive Office Building, Gore announced the National Small Business Person of the Year was David Giuliani, owner of Optiva Corp., of Bellevue, Wash.</p>
