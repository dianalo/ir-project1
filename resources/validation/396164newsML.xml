<p>About 150,000 demonstrators thronged central Belgrade late into the night to celebrate the end of 50 years of communist and socialist rule in the Serbian capital and to welcome their new mayor.</p>
<p>The mood was jubilant and deafening after a day in which Serbia's authoritarian President Slobodan Milosevic saw his party lose control of Belgrade city council and his rule challenged from Montenegro.</p>
<p>The crowd was celebrating the climax of three months of daily street protests which forced Milosevic to recognise opposition victories in November's local elections.</p>
<p>Young and old sang, cheered and clambered onto statues and windowsills of the National Museum to get a better view. Tiny &quot;Grandmother Olga&quot; who cheered protesters from her balcony daily during the marches addressed the rally.</p>
<p>In a symbolic act after taking power in the capital, the Zajedno (Together) coalition hacked a five-pointed star representing communism from the top of Belgrade city hall.</p>
<p>Its leaders told the crowd that their next target would be an identical star on the top of Serbia's parliament across the street.</p>
<p>Montenegrin Prime Minister Mile Djukanovic said  Milosevic would not get the Montenegrin votes needed to switch from the Serbian to the Yugoslav presidency this year and it would by &quot;totally wrong&quot; for him to stay.</p>
<p>Montenegro, the junior partner in the Yugoslav federation, is strongly placed to sabotage Milosevic's prospects of political survival after the turmoil caused by his attempt to revoke Zajedno's election wins.</p>
<p>Djukanovic told the independent Belgrade weekly Vreme: &quot;Milosevic's political thought is outdated; he lacks the ability to view things strategically and he is surrounded by the wrong people who keep him rather uninformed about the real scale of Serbia's and Yugoslavia's problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Milosevic, barred by law from a third term as Serbian president, planned to have himself elected Yugoslav president this year by the federal parliament.</p>
<p>But Montenegrin votes would be essential to make constitutional changes needed to give the ceremonial federal office the wide-ranging executive powers he wields as Serbian president.</p>
<p>Belgrade's new mayor, Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic, told the crowd the city government was only the first step in Zajedno's struggle to overthrow Milosevic.</p>
<p>&quot;We all know that this is only a small victory on our way to the ultimate victory -- the victory of democracy,&quot; he said to defeaning whistle blasts and cheers.</p>
<p>&quot;Just 50 metres away from the star we removed there stands another awaiting its turn to be taken to the museum...Tomorrow we shall re-start our struggle to reform, democratise and free Serbia,&quot; he declared.</p>
<p>&quot;We have taken (the star) where it belongs, the Museum of Revolution, to sit with other ideological symbols of the past.&quot;</p>
<p>The election dispute added democratic reforms to the West's demands in return for a gradual lifting of the remaining sanctions on Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The United States welcomed Zajedno's takeover of Belgrade but said it wanted to see more reforms including a free media.</p>
<p>Zajedno's breakthrough ignited a battle in the Socialist Party between hard-liners and pragmatists on how to keep the opposition at bay ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections due by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Djindjic said the struggle to free the media, over which Milosevic retains tight control, would begin immediately.</p>
