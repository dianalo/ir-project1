<p>Carlton Communications Plc said it had made an agreed offer to acquire Westcountry Television Ltd for 85 million pounds ($142.8 million) in cash. It said it had received irrevocable acceptances accounting for 77 percent of Westcountry's issued share capital.</p>
<p>The deal makes Carlton Britain's biggest independent television company, broadcasting to 22 million people or 38 percent of the population. It already owns the licences for the Midlands and for London weekday television.</p>
<p>Westcountry, a private company, holds the licence for much of southwestern England. ($ = 0.595 British Pounds)  </p>

<p>Carlton said it had paid 77 million sterling for the equity and eight million sterling for an employee incentive plan.</p>
<p>It said the region served by Westcountry, which made pre-tax profits in 1995 of five million sterling, was forceast to grow faster in terms of population and GDP than the UK as a whole.</p>
<p>&quot;Westcountry is a successful ITV company and we will build on its strengths. With Carlton, Central and Westcountry we will continue to enhance ITV's reputation as Britain's most popular channel,&quot; said Carlton chairman Michael Green.</p>
