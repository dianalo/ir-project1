<title>MEXICO: Mexico Cetes rate ends up, late liquidity squeeze.</title>
<headline>Mexico Cetes rate ends up, late liquidity squeeze.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1996-10-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates surged towards the close on Wednesday following a late pinch in liquidity as banks rushed to settle outstanding balances with the central bank, traders said.</p>
<p>The overnight Cetes rate closed at 23 percent, up 25 basis points from Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade was light all day and then all the money diasppeared towards the close,&quot; a trader said. &quot;Basically, it was speculation by dealers who had held on to paper and took advantage of banks that needed liquidity for the cutoff,&quot; a trader said.  </p>
<p>Wednesday saw the cutoff date for banks settling outstanding balances on checking accounts they hold with the Banco de Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;But once the pressure is over, we will be trading at around 22.50 percent again,&quot; the trader added.</p>
<p>Traders said that short-term interest rates were reaching floor levels following Tuesday night's primary rate falls and they expected the secondary market would be stable during coming sessions.  </p>
<p>&quot;They have to stop (rates) falling to uncompetitive levels, even though the peso market has been stable,&quot; another trader said. This was not the case on Wednesday, however, as dollars flowed in to the stock market and shored up the peso.</p>
<p>Falls in interest rates have often tended to weaken the peso in recent months. Overnight bank rates, meanwhile, closed up 100 basis points at 25 percent.</p>
<p>Traders estimated the central bank would inject 300 million pesos into the system on Wednesday evening to help banks settle checking accounts. This amount would add to liquidity shortages estimated at 3.296 billion pesos due to credit maturities on Thursday, they said.</p>
