<p>Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said on Friday the United States had boosted tension in the Iraqi crisis to maintain a grip on the region, but also blamed Baghdad for giving them the chance.</p>
<p>&quot;There are objectives pursued by the United States by creating such tension and that is to preserve their illegitimate presence in the Persian Gulf and Middle East,&quot; he told reporters after talks in South Africa with President Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>&quot;And of course Iraq has provided them with this pretext...by its invasion of Kuwait and its recent invasion of the Kurds (Kurdish lands),&quot; he said through an interpreter.</p>
<p>&quot;The victims of all these bad attitudes are the Iraqi people.&quot;</p>
<p>Rafsanjani did not comment on a U.N. report on Friday that 30,000 Kurdish refugees from northern Iraq had fled to three sites in Iran.</p>
<p>Mandela, who brushed aside U.S. displeasure to host Rafsanjani for a full state visit, also repeated criticism of Washington's actions which he made earlier this week, saying the United Nations was the body to sort out international problems.</p>
<p>&quot;No country is entitled to assume the role of policeman,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A U.S. armada of ships and assault planes closed in on Iraq on Friday, ready for a punishing bomb attack to end President Saddam Hussein's defiance of allied patrols of Iraqi air space.</p>
