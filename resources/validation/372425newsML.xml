<p>President Bill Clinton Wednesday said a strike by American Airlines' pilots would have &quot;huge implications&quot; for the nation and urged both sides to use federally mediated talks to avert a walkout.</p>
<p>&quot;Today I want to say that the time has not expired, and I want to encourage parties to make maximum use of the mediation board process. That's what ought to be done today,&quot; Clinton told reporters at a White House event on aviation safety.</p>
<p>&quot;This issue has huge implications for our country and in particular for specific parts of our country,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under the Railway Labour Act, which also covers airlines, the president has the power to declare a national emergency to stop a strike and keep the planes flying.</p>
<p>Clinton, who made his comments in response to a question on whether he was inclined to declare a national emergency, did not tip his hand, saying only: &quot;I have been following it very closely.&quot;</p>
<p>In November 1993, Clinton intervened to help end a strike by American Airlines' flight attendants when he successfully appealed to both sides to submit to arbitration.</p>
<p>Having failed to come to an agreement on their own, American, the nation's No. 2 carrier, and the Allied Pilots Association are negotiating under the auspices of a federal mediator. A strike by the 9,000 pilots would occur at midnight Friday unless a new contract can be reached.</p>
<p>Representatives of the two sides reached a tentative pact last September, but the pilots' rank-and-file rejected it in December, leading to the strike deadline and the federally mediated bargaining.</p>
<p>The two sides disagree on many issues, including pay.</p>
<p>An official at American, a unit of AMR Corp., said the airline had made a new proposal boosting its pay offer to a 6 percent raise over four years from 5 percent previously. The pilots want an 11.5 percent increase.</p>
<p>Although Clinton did not say what regions would be hardest hit by a strike, they would include Texas, Florida, Illinois and the New York metropolitan area since the Fort Worth-based carrier has major operations in Dallas-Fort Worth, Miami, Chicago and New York.</p>
<p>Senators from those regions met with top White House officials Wednesday to express their concerns about a possible strike.</p>
<p>Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, told reporters after the meeting that she had urged Clinton to &quot;use all the powers and persuasion of the presidency&quot; to facilitate a settlement.</p>
<p>Hutchison said the officials did not tip their hand in the meeting, adding, &quot;I leave here believing the president will not do anything until time has run out for the parties to voluntarily come to a settlement.&quot;</p>
<p>Sen. Dick Durbin (corrects), an Illinois Democrat, said that it was his understanding from the meeting that Clinton &quot;shares our watchful concern, but the burden is on the parties to come to an agreement before we even consider other alternatives.&quot;</p>
