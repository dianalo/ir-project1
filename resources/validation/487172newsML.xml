<p>South African shares, cowed by Wall Street's recent correction, are set for a flat performance next week, but portfolio managers said on Friday the local market may seek to break away from the Dow's influence.</p>
<p>New York shares posted their fourth drop in five days on Thursday amid fears of further interest rate hikes, triggering falls on nearly all global financial markets.</p>
<p>South African shares have been no exception and many players are still nervously eyeing Wall Street.</p>
<p>&quot;People are looking across the Atlantic from here, just as they are everywhere else. Wall Street is dominating,&quot; said one portfolio manager who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>A strong performance next week by South African shares will therefore be unlikely, but there are signs the local market may be breaking away from the U.S.-watching herd mentality.</p>
<p>South African industrial shares ended up on Thursday, despite a fall in New York overnight and they started trade in positive territory on Friday -- again turning a blind eye to Wall Street's drop the previous day.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some encouraging signs that people are starting to look at the fundamentals. Our market is not as overvalued as Wall Street and so should behave differently,&quot; said Andre Joubert, portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management.</p>
<p>The difference between the South African and U.S.markets was exemplified by the fact that local fund managers had recently reduced their U.S. equity exposure in favour of cash, while not significantly changing their local asset distribution.</p>
<p>No major news is expected on the economic front, except for producer inflation data due on Thursday.</p>
<p>However, there is more activity on the corporate news side with Monday seeing interim results from oil firm Engen Ltd and packaging group Kohler Ltd.</p>
<p>Wednesday will see interim results from chemicals firm Sentrachem Ltd and year figures from stores firm Pick'n'Pay Ltd.</p>
<p>Analysts and dealers will be poring over the data from Pick'n'Pay, which with its heavy retail exposure may give clues to the broader state of the economy and consumer confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;Corporate earnings are still under a lot of pressure. Some will be good, but these are the exceptions. We are in for a period of flat equity prices,&quot; Joubert said.</p>
<p>Another negative local factor likely to weigh on shares next week is reaction to recently announced higher-than-expected local money supply and credit figures that put a dampener on hopes for an early interest rate cut.</p>
<p>Money supply grew 15.82 percent in February, according to preliminary Reserve Bank figures, against a consensus forecast of 15.1 percent, while private sector growth came in at 17.34 percent against a consensus of 16.39 percent.</p>
