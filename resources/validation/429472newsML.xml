<title>USA: Niagra Mohawk rallies, other US corporate debt calm.</title>
<headline>Niagra Mohawk rallies, other US corporate debt calm.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-10</dateline>

<p>Dramatic spread tigthening for Niagara Mohawk Power Corp debt enlivened otherwise dead-quiet U.S. corporate bond trade on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>High-yielding issues were equally quiet, junk traders said, with exception to activity in the distressed bonds backed by Marvel Entertainment Group and bonds of Cablevision Systems Corp.</p>
<p>Niagara Mohawk debt rallied 25 to 30 basis points after the company said it tentatively agreed in principle to restructure or terminate 44 contracts to purchase power from 19 independent power producers, traders said.  </p>
<p>Niagara Mohawk said it plans to pay for the restructuring and contract termination with $3.2 billion in new debt, $400 million in cash, and the issuance of 46 million shares of common stock.</p>
<p>Analysts interviewed were almost non-plussed by the additional debt, noting that the savings realized by the termination of above-market cost contracts will improve cash flow and enhance its competitive edge. In fact, most analysts believed the company stands a good chance at achieving investment grade status at the turn of the century.  </p>
<p>&quot;Despite the fact there is substantial debt there is also substantial cash flow suitable for refinancing the debt,&quot; said John Spellman, utilities analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. &quot;We've also gone from a situation where the company went from an ever increasing liability in the form of payments to a defineable number which can be amortized down in time.&quot;</p>
<p>At the close, Niagara Mohawk's 8s of 2004 were quoted more than 25 basis points tighter at 145 bid, 125 offer. The 8-1/2s of 2023 rallied to a wide 185 bid, 140 offer market.</p>
<p>The tightening resulted in few trades, but the Street expected activity to accelerate once news is digested.  </p>
<p>Other spreads were flat in thin trading, players said.</p>
<p>New issuance included $250 million in seven-year notes from Travelers Group Inc unit Smith Barney Holdings, priced as 7s to yield 53 basis points over the Treasury curve. The issue was rated A2/A-minus and was priced via Smith Barney &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Turning to high-yielders, bonds of Cablevision Systems lost about 1/2 point amid a static market elsewhere based on news that the company's proposed acquisition of its remaining 50 percent interest in Madison Square Garden properties.</p>
<p>The Cablevision 9-1/4s of 2005 were quoted at 98-1/4 bod, 98-3/4 offer at the close, one trader said.</p>
