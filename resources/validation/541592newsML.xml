<headline>Veteran Chinese leader Peng Zhen dies at 95 - Xinhua.</headline>
<dateline>BEIJING 1996-04-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Peng Zhen, the first senior victim of China's radical Cultural Revolution and a close associate of late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, died on Saturday. He was 95.</p>
<p>The son of poor peasants from northern Shanxi province, he was China's last surviving elder statesman from the generation of the revolutionaries who swept the communists to power in 1949.</p>
<p>He died of illness, the Xinhua news agency said but gave no details.</p>
<p>China's Communist Party Central Committee and all top state bodies expressed &quot;profound grief&quot; at Peng's death.</p>
<p>An official obituary described Peng as &quot;a great proletarian revolutionary and statesman, an outstanding activist in state affairs, a staunch Marxist and a major founder of the socialist legal system in China&quot;.</p>
<p>His death removes from China's political scene the highest-ranking and oldest member of the &quot;old immortals&quot; -- leaders renowned for their longevity -- to outlive Deng Xiaoping. Deng died on February 19, aged 92.</p>
<p>The influence of veteran revolutionaries such as Peng has continued to cast a shadow over their successors because of the enormous behind-the-scenes power they were able to wield for years after retiring from all official posts.</p>
<p>Long after Deng had disappeared from the public eye, Peng still appeared occasionally, sometimes in a wheelchair, lively, alert and a force to be reckoned with into his 90s.</p>
<p>Peng, once described by an adversary as &quot;disarmingly aggressive&quot;, commanded a vast network of connections built up over years in the party hierarchy and as chairman of parliament, the National People's Congress.</p>
<p>Selected by Deng as head of parliament, he spearheaded creation of a real system of law to replace a centuries-old vacuum that both men blamed for the chaos of Chairman Mao Zedong's ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution in which they and millions of other Chinese were purged.</p>
<p>Party secretary and mayor of Beijing for 15 years and a close ally of then head of state Liu Shaoqi, Peng was hounded from office in June, 1966, by radicals charging he had transformed Beijing into a personal empire from which to combat Mao's policies.</p>
<p>He was banished to the countryside for 12 years, and returned to Beijing only after his longtime ally, Deng, returned to power in 1978.</p>
<p>He regained prominence in the late 1970s and was appointed chairman of the National People's Congress in 1983, a job that afforded him ample opportunity to build a powerbase.</p>
<p>He stepped down from parliament in April 1988 as part of Deng's drive to retire ageing communist comrades, but retained widespread influence.</p>
<p>He was a staunch ally of Deng, and a particularly vociferous promoter of Deng's campaign against &quot;bourgeois liberalisation&quot; -- Chinese jargon for Western ideas -- launched during a hardline resurgence in early 1987.</p>
<p>During the 1989 pro-democracy movement that sent millions of Chinese into the streets, Peng reportedly defended the Beijing leadership's decision to impose martial law. However, he appeared to take a less harsh line than his ageing colleagues against the students who demonstrated.</p>
<p>The motives of the students, he was reported as telling a special emergency meeting of the party Central Committee, were pure and patriotic.</p>
<p>Days later, Beijing leaders ordered troops and tanks to crack down on the protests, killing hundreds.</p>
<p>Born in 1902 into a poor peasant family in northern Shanxi province, Peng Zhen joined the Communist Party in 1923.</p>
<p>He is survived by several children. One of his sons, Chen Yuan, is vice governor of the central bank, the People's Bank of China, and a daughter runs a venture capital company.</p>
