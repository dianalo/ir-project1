<p>There will be enough food in the Asia-Pacific region for the next 20 years despite the increasing appetite of China and other emerging countries, economists said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Economists attending a three-day conference in Manila on food and agricultural policy challenges in the region said they expected technological advances to bolster food production.</p>
<p>&quot;The region's food basket is expected to produce more at cheaper costs, enough to offset projected rise in consumption from developing countries, primarily due to advances made in biotechnology,&quot; said Carl Pray, an economics professor from Rutgers University in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Pray said he expected losses due to pests and diseases in agricultural products to lessen because of genetic engineering.</p>
<p>&quot;Biotechnology is going to pay off in the next 10 to 20 years, and losses due to pests and diseases will go down,&quot; Pray said in an interview.</p>
<p>Robert Evenson, professor of economics at Yale University, said on Tuesday he expected grain imports to rise to feed increasingly well-off China and other economies in the region.</p>
<p>Rising grain imports from emerging countries would add pressure on prices in the short term, other economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;Increases in China's food imports will slightly raise world prices for wheat, maize and drive up world prices for livestock products as well as feed grains,&quot;  Jikun Huang, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences, said in a paper presented at the meeting which ended on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pray said he expected China, which recently became a net grain importer, would eventually increase its food supply to feed its swelling population.</p>
<p>&quot;Eventually, China will produce a lot more, and the rest of Asia-Pacific countries,&quot; he added.</p>
