<title>LUXEMBOURG: Court allows export refunds for all milk-coffee products.</title>
<headline>Court allows export refunds for all milk-coffee products.</headline>
<dateline>LUXEMBOURG 1997-07-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Court of Justice said on Thursday export refunds for milk products containing coffee extracts, essence, or concentrates and milk products with a basis of coffee are permitted under common market milk rules.</p>
<p>The basis for the refund is the difference between international market prices and the prices in the Community, the court said.</p>
<p>In a reference for a preliminary ruling, the court considered the validity of the milk regulation in so far as it treats export refunds for milk products with a basis in coffee differently from refunds for milk products containing extracts, essences or concentrates of coffee.</p>
<p>The court noted the Common Customs Tariff Code has separate subheadings for these two milk with coffee products, but said the larger distinction being made was between products with milk or milkfat, and those without.</p>
<p>&quot;Preparations made with a basis in coffee...must be understood as covering all preparations made from coffee products comprising milk products...and the regulation contains no rule that refunds are excluded where the proportion of milk product...does not exceed a certain level,&quot; the court reasoned.</p>

<p>EXCERPTS FROM THE JUDGMENT</p>
<p>C-334/95</p>
<p>Reference for a preliminary ruling from the Finanzgericht Hamburg (Germany) in the proceedings between</p>
<p>Kruger GmbH &amp; Co. KG</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Hauptzollamt Hamburg-Jonas</p>
<p>on (i) the validity of article 17(1) of Council regulation (EEC) No 804/68 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (OJ, English Special Edition 1968(I), p. 176), as amended by Council regulation (EEC) No 3904/87 (OJ 1987 L 370, p. 1), read in combination with its annex, and on the consequences of any declaration of invalidity and (ii) the interpretation of article 244 of Council regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (OJ 1992 L 302, p. 1) and article 177 of the EC Treaty</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>THE COURT hereby rules</p>
<p>1. Article 17(1) of Council regulation (EEC) No 804/68 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (OJ, English Special Edition 1968(I), p. 176), as amended by Council regulation (EEC) No 3904/87 (OJ 1987 L 370, p. 1), read in combination with its annex whih refers to subheading 2101 10 of the Combined Nomenclature, as established in the annex to Council regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff, in the version contained in Council regulation (EEC) No 2505/92, is to be interpreted as allowing export refunds to be granted in respect of milk products contained in both preparations with a bais of cofee and preparations with a basis of extracts, essences or concentrates of coffee.</p>
<p>2. Article 244 of Council regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code is not applicable to demands for repayment of export refunds.</p>
<p>3. A national court may suspend implementation of a national administrative decision based on a Community act only if:</p>
<p>- that court entertains serious doubts as to the validity of the Community act and, if the validity of the contested act is not already in issue before the Court of Justice, itself refers the question to the Court of Justice;</p>
<p>- there is urgency, in that the interim relief is necessary to avoid serious and irreparable damage from being caused to the party seeking the relief;</p>
<p>- the national court takes due account of the Community interest; and</p>
<p>- in its assessment of all those conditions, the national court respects any decisions of the Court of Justice or the Court of First Instance ruling on the lawfulness of the Community act or on an application for interim measures seeking similar interim relief at Community level.</p>
<p>4. The second paragraph of article 177 of the EC Treaty does not preclude a national court which has ordered suspension of implementation of a national administrative decision and referred to the Court for a preliminary ruling a question on the validity of the Community act on which the decision is based from granting leave to appeal against its decision.</p>
