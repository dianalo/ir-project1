<p>Two major German steel groups that shook the country's way of doing business last spring with plans to merge some units and cut jobs are now in talks for a full merger, a leading news magazine will report on Monday.</p>
<p>Germany's Der Spiegel said senior management at Thyssen AG and Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp have met for talks to discuss a merger of the two groups once the deal to combine their flat steel units is approved in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The magazine said Thyssen chief executive Dieter Vogel and his counterpart at Krupp, Gerhard Cromme, have been involved in the talks with top executives at the two groups located in Germany's &quot;rust belt&quot; in the northern Ruhr River Valley.</p>
<p>The merger talks are at such an advanced stage that Vogel officially notified the Thyssen supervisory board at a meeting on July 17 of the discussions, Spiegel said, according to excerpts released ahead of publication on Monday.</p>
<p>Officials at both companies said at the weekend that it was well known that further cooperation talks would take place after the flat steel unit merger, which will create a new European steel giant even as it sheds about 8,000 jobs.</p>
<p>But the officials would not confirm whether leadership at the two companies are near agreement on a mega-merger.</p>
<p>&quot;Contact between the two groups about further cooperation has only just begun,&quot; Thyssen spokesman Reiner Hochscheid told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;More concrete discussions will only really begin when the merger in the steel area is completed and what will happen then is totally open,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Krupp spokesman Juergen Laasen told Reuters that talks over the flat steel merger were &quot;going well&quot; and noted earlier statements from the two groups of the possiblity for further cooperation beyond their steel units would be examined.</p>
<p>Krupp had launched a rare hostile takeover bid for Thyssen last March, sparking a wave of large-scale protests in the Ruhr Valley that forced Cromme, the chairman of Krupp, to withdraw his bid and settle for the steel unit merger.</p>
<p>Thousands of angry steel workers at Krupp went on strike in an attempt to secure confirmation that jobs would not be cut.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of workers also attended rallies around the country to protest further job cuts at a time of post-war record unemployment, casting particular blame on major banks who would have helped finance the takeover.</p>
<p>Top German politicians also sharply criticised the takeover bid for shaking Germany's tradition of cooperation between industry, workers, banks and government seen as fostering the country's economic recovery after World War Two.</p>
<p>A deal between Thyssen and Krupp could create Germany's fifth-largest industrial group. Thyssen reported sales of almost 39 billion marks in its 1996/97 business year and has a global workforce of about 124,000 people. Krupps had 1996 sales of over 24 billion marks and a workforce of 70,000.</p>
<p>The steel unit merger, which calls for Thyssen to take a 60 percent stake and Krupp a 40 percent stake, will create a huge group capable of making 15 million tonnes of steel a year that will be equal in might to France's Unsinor-Sacilor or British Steel.</p>
<p>The new company, Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG, will concentrate on hot metal operations at Thyssen's main Duisburg steel works by shutting down three blast furnaces at Krupp's Dortmund plant and expanding rolling and processing work at Krupp Hoesch.</p>
