<p>Nigeria has released a third journalist detained without charge for nearly a year, a week after two others held without trial were freed, the Vanguard newspaper reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Vanguard said its defence correspondent, George Onah, was freed on Wednesday after 356 days in detention.</p>
<p>No reason had been given for his arrest. He was picked up in May last year after writing a story on retirements in the army.</p>
<p>&quot;He was released to the warm embrace of his wife, Josephine and daughter Jennifer...George was picked up when she was a week old,&quot; wrote his paper.</p>
<p>Freelance journalist Ladi Olorunyomi, detained since March, and Godwin Agbroko, editor of the The Week magazine who had been in detention from December 1996, were freed last week.</p>
<p>Agbroko was detained when his magazine published reports of disagreements in the ruling military council.</p>
<p>Journalist groups have recently stepped up their campaign against the detentions.</p>
<p>Olorunyomi's husband Dapo, an editor of the opposition magazine The News, fled to the United States fearing arrest over reports in the magazine about a coup plot to topple the military government.</p>
<p>Another editor of the magazine is serving a long jail term with three other journalists over the alleged plot along with more than 30 former officers including retired General Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military ruler.</p>
<p>Nigeria's military government is under criticism at home and abroad over detentions without trial and the slow pace of its plan to return Africa's most populous nation to democracy.</p>
