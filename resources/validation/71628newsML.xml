<p>Thailand's premier, forced at the weekend to declare he would resign, may yet strike back at detractors before fading from the political scene, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>Banharn Silpa-archa, who promised on Saturday to quit in seven days after finding a suitable successor, wants to have a big say on who the next prime minister should be and who should be in the next cabinet, they told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister wishes to see continuity and does not want to create a political vaccum. So he won't officially resign until he picks his successor and a new cabinet line up,&quot; his spokesman Somsak Prisana-anantakul told reporters.</p>
<p>Banharn was unexpectedly forced by some of the leaders of his own six-party coalition government to announce his resignation just before a parliamentary no-confidence vote, in return for coalition support in the vote.</p>
<p>He won the vote 207-180 in the 391-seat parliament but he was politically humiliated.</p>
<p>At the no-confidence debate, opposition politicians accused him of condoning corruption and economic misamanagement. Doubts were also raised about his Thai nationality and eligibility to be premier.</p>
<p>Banharn denied the charges.</p>
<p>Somsak said the coalition partners had agreed to give Banharn the mandate to pick his successor from politicians in the six coalition parties before he resigned.</p>
<p>Analysts have widely tipped Defence Minister General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who heads the New Aspiration Party (NAP) and was a key figure in engineering Banharn's downfall, as his possible successor.</p>
<p>But coalition sources said Banharn instead favoured someone from his core Chart Thai party, which controls 91 seats or most of the 209 coalition seats in parliament, to succeed him.</p>
<p>A top Chart Thai contender for the premiership is the party's elder statesman Pramarn Adireksan, they said. Another possibility is the leader of the opposition Chart Pattana party, former premier and old Banharn friend Chatichai Choonhavan.</p>
<p>Outsider Chatichai and his party could be asked to join the existing coalition to enable him to become premier or his Chart Pattana party could merge with Chart Thai, analysts said.</p>
<p>Chavalit told reporters on Monday that the attempt to pick a new premier and cabinet line-up had not progressed much.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing much has progressed, nothing much has changed since the prime minister is still in office. I do not want to talk about the (prime minister's) position, otherwise people will accuse me of wanting to be the next prime minister,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chavalit on Sunday had chaired a meeting of the coalition negotiating to form a new government.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think Chavalit will be the next prime minister,&quot; political analyst Sukhum Naulskum told reporters. He predicted that Banharn would either opt for Pramarn Adireksan or Chatichai to replace him and teach Chavalit a lesson.</p>
<p>&quot;The ball is in Banharn's court now... He still has power in his hand and he can do whatever he likes... even dissolve the house,&quot; Sukhum said.</p>
<p>While some analysts believed Banharn would not dissolve parliament after his public promise, others said he could leave his indelible mark on Thai politics by doing the unexpected.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything can happen in the next few days,&quot; said Thawil Praison, deputy leader of the Palang Dharma Party, which was a member of Banharn's coalition until last month.</p>
<p>&quot;Judging by what Chavalit and others did to him, if Banharn has to pick the successor I think he will choose Chatichai,&quot; he said.</p>
