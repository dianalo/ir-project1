<p>Republic Industries Inc. and ADT Ltd. Monday terminated their proposed $5 billion merger agreement after three months of widespread uncertainty and speculation.</p>
<p>The proposed stock deal, which called for Republic to buy North America's largest electronic security firm, had been hurt by volatility in Republic's stock since the agreement was announced July 1. It also faced opposition from Western Resources Inc., a Kansas utility that holds a 24.3 percent stake in ADT.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite both companies' initial enthusiasm about this transaction, we now have agreed that this combination is no longer in the best interests of our respective companies,&quot; Republic Chairman Wayne Huizenga said in a statement.</p>
<p>The deal's termination was viewed as a major setback for Republic, the aggressive company led by Huizenga, who founded Blockbuster Entertainment and owns the Florida Marlins and other professional sports teams.</p>
<p>&quot;It's apparent that Republic needed ADT a lot more than ADT needed Republic,&quot; said Andrew Jeffrey of Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Originally valued at $5 billion, the deal's value declined sharply just weeks after it was struck when Republic's stock price sank below $20 per share. The agreement had been based on a price of $26 for each share of ADT common stock.</p>
<p>The deal's success had been uncertain amid reports that ADT was demanding some type of price protection against volatility in Republic stock.</p>
<p>Republic had confirmed negotiations were continuing and earlier this month expressed confidence the transaction would be completed by the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;The good news is that we finally have an answer,&quot; said Randall Haase, a portfolio manager at Alliance Capital Management. &quot;It's better that they walk away now than to wait for another six months.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the recent problems, the companies presented a united front in announcing the termination, saying they would proceed with other opportunities.</p>
<p>&quot;The delay in completing the transaction forced both companies to put business expansion plans on hold for too long. Both companies will now be free to resume their individual business plans,&quot; said ADT Chairman Michael Ashcroft.</p>
<p>The electronic security industry is booming as consumers buy protection systems for their homes and businesses. Alarm companies also have become more valuable in recent months as utilities and telecommunications companies form alliances with market players to add protection to their list of services.</p>
<p>Industry experts said ADT was well prepared to capitalise on the boom. Just moments after the companies announced the deal was off, analysts advised investors to scoop up ADT shares.</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers analyst Jeffrey Kessler recommended investors buy the stock, citing ADT as &quot;the single most attractive security property in an era of increasing demand by telecom/electric/cable utilities for value-added services.&quot;</p>
<p>Although ADT's stock fell $1 to $18.875 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading, experts were unswayed by the decline. The stock was trading at about $19.50 before the deal was announced in July.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors rarely get a second chance to buy at a discount, and that's where this stock is today,&quot; said Robertson Stephens' Jeffrey.</p>
<p>At an industry conference last week focusing on security mergers and acquisitions, ADT Chief Financial Officer Steve Ruzika said the company was in the throes of expansion.</p>
<p>ADT's growth plans include this week's launch of a vehicle protection service, and partnerships with Radio Shack and HFS Century 21 and other companies. Earlier this year, ADT bought Britain's Automated Security Holdings Plc.</p>
<p>Republic will now be forced to retrench as it seeks to grab market share in the security industry, analysts said. Although it has bought 19 companies since it entered the market last year, the acquisitions have been far smaller than the proposed ADT deal.</p>
<p>Republic's other businesses are solid waste and used cars.</p>
<p>Analysts speculated that Huizenga, a well-known deal maker, is not prepared to give up his acquisition strategy, although the company could be hindered in the future by the same issues that dealt the fatal blow to the ADT transaction.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a limited number of large players, but there are still a lot of smaller alarm players who will jump at the opportunity to take Republic stock,&quot; Jeffrey said.</p>
<p>Republic officials were not available to comment. The company's stock was up $1.75 at $29 on Nasdaq.</p>
