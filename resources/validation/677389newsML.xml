<text>
<p>Horticultural group Arthur Yates and Co Ltd said on Friday it expected its full year profit before abnormals for the year to June 30, 1997 to be below the same period last year.  </p>
<p>Yates said it also expected the result to be affected by abnormal costs of about A$2 million after tax associated with a cost reduction programme.</p>
<p>The expected result followed poor trading conditions in May. Directors would review the final dividend in the light of the final result, Yates said in a statement.</p>
<p>Chairman Stanley Howard said the retail market for the garden products industry continued to be difficult and pressure on margins had not abated.</p>
<p>The current difficult trading environment was expected to continue, he added.  </p>
<p>Yates said it had accelerated a cost reduction programme following the disappointing May result.</p>
<p>Intiatives included closure of the Auckland packet seed packing and chemical packing plants, subcontracting of lawn seed packing and centralising customer services and order processing.</p>
<p>The cuts were expected to have a significant favourable impact on future results, and to take about A$2 million of costs, before tax, out of the business in 1997/98, Yates said.</p>
<p>Staff numbers would be cut by about 12 percent, while the sale of surplus real estate would raise more than A$3 million.</p>
