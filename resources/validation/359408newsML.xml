<p>IMM currency futures ended mixed after a session of uneventful range-trade before more U.S. economic data Friday and a weekend Group of Seven confab.</p>
<p>Futures showed scant response late when French finance minister Jean Arthuis said that current foreign exchange rates were more in line with fundamentals and that this must be consolidated in a lasting way.</p>
<p>Nor did currencies budge on news that Federal Reserve policymakers at their December 17 meeting voted unanimously to keep policy unchanged but kept a tightening bias, saying rates were more likely to rise than fall in the future.  </p>
<p>The Canadian dollar eroded during the afternoon, with brokers saying the U.S. dollar triggered buystops in the cash market near the futures equivalent level of $0.7433.</p>
<p>A floor broker said technically the contract also could fall further before resuming its longer-term move higher. He said if March Canadian dollar futures punch below the $0.7422 level, the contract could slip to $0.7414.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a pretty bearish scenario,&quot; he said of the Canadian unit's nearterm outlook. &quot;It's in a corrective mode downward.&quot;</p>
<p>The Swiss franc, meanwhile, garnered some additional support from talk of big cash buying against yen.  </p>
<p>Swiss franc rose overseas after some independent Swiss economists said in a report compiled in January and issued at the University of Lausanne that it was possible the Swiss unit was near levels where it could be considered undervalued.</p>
<p>As expected, the Bank of England, the Bundesbank and the Swiss National Bank on Thursday left official rates steady.</p>
<p>Marks backed off on news that the German employment picture dimmed more in January, when pan-German joblessness rose a seasonally adjusted 160,000 versus December 1996.</p>
<p>Some said the figures would give the Bundesbank a compelling reason to weigh a move toward lower rates.  </p>
<p>March yen recovered from a new contract low hit overnight at $0.008105 or 124.00 spot as traders waited to see whether Group of Seven indicates discomfort with the dollar's runup. &quot;If they (G7) don't come up with some sort of stability pact, this yen is going to 125.00 pretty quickly,&quot; said the broker.</p>
<p>Friday's January U.S. jobs report is seen showing non-farm payrolls rose 237,000, with joblessness at 5.2 percent.</p>
<p>March yen rose $0.000004 to $0.008130, marks lost $0.0013 to $0.6072, Swiss fr. up $0.0008 at $0.7042,pound fell $0.0058 to $1.6332, Can dollar fell $0.0034 to $0.7428, Aussie dollar rose $0.0024 to $0.7646, Mex peso rose $0.000150 to $0.125775.
