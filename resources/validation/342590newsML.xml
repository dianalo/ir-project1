<p>Taiwan share prices finished slightly higher on Wednesday despite late profit-taking by cautious investors ahead of the central bank's scheduled board meeting on Thursday, brokers said.</p>
<p>The weighted index ended up a scant 3.33 points or 0.05 percent at 7,149.54, off an intra-session high of 7,182.45.</p>
<p>Turnover was a modest T$52.3 billion.</p>
<p>The bank board would meet after the close of Taiwan's stock, bond and money markets at 0800 GMT on Thursday, officials said.</p>
<p>Brokers said some investors tried to lay in quick profits, concerned that the central bank may adjust its monetary policy.  </p>
<p>The state-run Central News Agency said central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong was expected to stand by the bank's longstanding &quot;stable to loose&quot; monetary policy after the board meeting.</p>
<p>The agency, without naming a source, said Sheu also would pledge to ensure adequate money market liquidity to meet strong seasonal demand arising ahead of the lunar Chinese new year holiday, which falls on February 7.</p>
<p>The detention of Tan Ching-lien, host of a popular cable TV show that continued to proffer speculative shares after being fined for stock manipulation, sent speculative shares tumbing but appeared to have had little wider impact, brokers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Investors have turned more rational now,&quot; said Michael Hung, research chief of Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>Tan, an unlicenced stock analyst who allegedly used his big cable audience to manipulate certain shares, was detained by prosecutors for violating securities trading laws, officials said. Tan could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Shares promoted by Tan's TV show led Wednesday's fall, with Jui Li plunging by the daily seven percent limit to T$28.1.</p>
<p>Stocks with good fundamentals rose, nudging the index up, brokers said. Plastics and chemicals were up 0.94 percent.</p>
<p>Most-active share Union Petrochem gained T$2.3 to T$41.</p>
