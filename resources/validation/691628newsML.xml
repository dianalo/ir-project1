<headline>NFL AMERICAN FOOTBALL-HALL OF FAME RECEIVER DON HUTSON DEAD AT 84.</headline>
<dateline>GREEN BAY, Wisconsin 1997-06-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hall of Fame receiver Don Hutson, whose record for touchdown catches stood for four decades, died Thursday in California. He was 84.</p>
<p>Hutson was a member of the National Football League's 50th Anniversary Team in 1970 and the 75th Anniversary Team in 1994. He led the league in receiving eight times, receiving yardage a record seven times and scoring five times during an 11-year career with the Green Bay Packers.</p>
<p>Hutson also played safety and kicker and was named to the NFL's All-Time Two-Way Team in 1994.</p>
<p>Credited with inventing his own pass patterns, Hutson broke into the NFL in 1935 after a collegiate career at Alabama. He still holds the league record for points in a quarter (29) and his record for career touchdown receptions (99) stood from his retirement in 1945 until it was broken on December 10, 1989 by Steve Largent of the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
<p>During Hutson's career, the Packers won NFL championships in 1936, 1938, 1939 and 1944. He retired in 1945 and was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963.</p>
<p>&quot;I speak for the entire Green Bay Packers organisation when I say that we are extremely saddened to hear of Don Hutson's passing,&quot; Packers general manager Ron Wolf said. &quot;He most certainly was the greatest player in the history of the franchise.</p>
<p>&quot;In the era he played in, he was the dominant player in the game, not just as a receiver, but as a kicker and with his ability to play defence. He led the National Football League in receptions eight times in his 11 seasons, including five straight years, something that no other player in the history of our game can even come close to touching.&quot;</p>
