<headline>S.Africa stocks end weak as rate cut hopes dwindle.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG</dateline>
<text>
<p>South African shares ended Friday firmly down as hopes of an early interest rate cut faded and gold shares also ended soft, but off their day lows, as they ignored a firmer bullion price, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said futures players were directing trade as they cut long positions, putting pressure on equities.</p>
<p>Trade was thin and volatile with only 485 million rand worth of shares trade.</p>
<p>Gold shares refused to ride on bullion's recovery as players were wary of the platinum-inspired rally. Dealers said the market felt the rally was not related to bullion fundamentals.</p>
<p>The market was seen soft next week with occasional bounces after the GDP figure.</p>
<p>The industrial index dropped 77.7 points, or 0.93 percent, to 8,240.2 points, the gold index shed 7.8 points to 1,173.8 points and the all-share index was down 53.0 points to 7,021.7 points.</p>
