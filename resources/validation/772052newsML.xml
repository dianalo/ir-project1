<p>Tajikistan on Friday made another step  towards national reconciliation after a four-year civil war when its  parliament declared an amnesty for those who took part in the former  Soviet state's fratricidal conflict.</p>
<p>&quot;In line with the law, all persons who took part in the armed political  confrontation in Tajikistan are liable to amnesty, excluding those  who committed grave crimes,&quot; presidential legal adviser Khalifabobo  Khamidov told Reuters.</p>
<p>A minute earlier, the law was adopted by 135 votes to two.</p>
<p>&quot;I, as the president, will try to do everything not to allow new bloodshed  on Tajik land, which is still damp with blood,&quot; Tajik leader Imomali  Rakhmonov told the legislature.</p>
<p>Adopting a law on amnesty was among the major conditions of the final  peace agreement signed by Tajikistan's secular government with the  Central Asian state's united Islamist opposition in Moscow on June  27.</p>
<p>The agreement -- brokered by Russia, Iran and the United Nations --  put an end to a four-year civil war which claimed the lives of tens  of thousands of people and made many others refugees.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, a 26-member commission for national revival headed  by opposition leader Sayid Abdullo Nuri is to observe the fulfilment  of the accords reached and prepare new parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>The commission could launch its activities very soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Technically, it should be possible that the commission actually starts  its work no later than by the middle of this month,&quot; Gerd Dietrich  Merrem, head of the U.N. mission in Tajikistan, told a news conference  on Friday.</p>
<p>Dovlat Usmon, commander of the opposition armed forces, told reporters  the work of the commission becomes possible after the government agrees  that 460 armed Islamist fighters enter the capital Dushanbe to safeguard  the lives of opposition members in the commission.</p>
