<p>Organisers of Thursday's Golden Gala grand prix are billing the meeting as a return to basics after two unsatisfactory million dollar extravaganzas at the weekend.</p>
<p>Donovan Bailey won his head-to-head clash against Michael Johnson in Toronto on Sunday after the American pulled up 30 metres from the line in their 150 metres showdown.</p>
<p>On the previous day, Noureddine Morceli also failed to finish in his two-mile race against Haile Gebrselassie in the Dutch town of Hengelo.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe I risk being seen as behind the times but I must say that I don't like certain meetings,&quot; Italian athletic federation president Gianni Gola said this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Toronto was fairground athletics. We on the other hand are offering real athletics, full of interesting duels in a programme that I believe to be extremely valid.&quot;</p>
<p>According to local newspapers, organisers will offer $50,000 for a world record but prefer to play down the money talk as much as possible in favour of highlighting the attractions of Rome in the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;If Zurich is the point of reference for its big budget, Rome wants to be the key meeting of the early part of the season,&quot; said Gola. &quot;The athletes have shown that they like Rome, even if there is not much money on offer.&quot;</p>
<p>The main duel will be in the 200 metres between Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, who beat the 23-year-old over 100 metres in France on Monday.</p>
<p>World indoor champion Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, who failed in an attempt to break Morceli's 1,500 metres world record at Saint-Denis on Monday, will run the distance again at the Olympic Stadium.</p>
<p>El Guerrouj set the fastest 1,500 metres time in the world this year at the Hengelo meeting.</p>
<p>World steeplechase champion Moses Kiptanui of Kenya is racing the 3,000 metres in the closing event of the evening.</p>
<p>Cuban high jump world record holder Javier Sotomayor will be present for only his second event since a disappointing 1996 Olympics and subsequent injury problems.</p>
<p>The women's events offer Russia's double Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova her first real challenge of the season in the 800 metres against Cuba's world champion Ana Quirot</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment I'm aiming everything towards the 800 metres and the world championships,&quot; said Masterkova. &quot;The next few races will help me assess my conditions and those of my rivals.&quot;</p>
<p>She also has other matters on her mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Shoes. In Rome I'd like to buy a nice pair of shoes,&quot; the Russian said.</p>
