<p>Finland's Juha Kankunnen upstaged the pre-event favourites to lead the Acropolis Rally after the opening leg from Athens to Kamena Vourla on Sunday.</p>
<p>Kankunnen, who returned to the series in the Argentine Rally two weeks ago as replacement for German Armin Schwarz, had built a 27-second lead over Mitsubishi team mates Tommi Makinen and Richard Burns.</p>
<p>The Finnish driver was the only front-runner not to hit problems on the punishing opening day's stages and moved to the head of the field when early leader Kenneth Eriksson of Sweden rolled his car on the sixth stage.</p>
<p>&quot;Leading the rally is a good position to be in and it has been a good day all round,&quot; said Kankunnen, who drives for Ford.</p>
<p>&quot;I've tried to drive carefully and miss a lot of the boulders, while those ahead took bigger risks by cutting the corners. There is no reason for me to change tactics.&quot;</p>
<p>World championship leader Makinen, who lost time on the fifth stage when his tyres were shredded by the rough conditions, was never far behind Kankunnen but thankful that his main championship rival Briton Colin McRae had retired from the event during the second stage.</p>
<p>McRae had led the rally after the first stage, but a mistake on the second 23-km long stage saw him hit a bank, forcing him out of the race.</p>
<p>&quot;We were on a fast right-hander, ran wide because of a bit of understeer and clipped the outside bank,&quot; said the Subaru driver, who won the event last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The conditions here are probably second only to the Safari Rally and although the Subaru is one of the toughest cars, such a short, sharp impact can and did have devastating effects.&quot;</p>
<p>The disappointment for the Subaru team continued on the sixth stage when Eriksson, who led the rally from the end of the fourth stage, rolled his car and lost 10 minutes before he got going again.</p>
<p>The second leg of the rally on Monday will take the teams north of Kamena Vourla before returning to the city again for another overnight stop.</p>
