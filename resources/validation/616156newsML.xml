<p>Shares of food company Cadbury took a big tumble in Nigerian stock trading on Tuesday, further depressing a falling market, dealers said.</p>
<p>The all-share index slumped to 8642.23 from 8666.53 on Monday.</p>
<p>Cadbury fell 80 kobo to 37.00 naira as traders dumped its shares in a market reeling from illiquidity, one dealer said.</p>
<p>It joined leading banks and oil companies whose stocks have been falling substantially over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Total was down 40 kobo at 59.50 naira while Agip fell 25 kobo to 22.25 naira. Traders said large quantities of their stocks were still flooding the market.</p>
<p>Banking shares were not spared. First Bank was down 40 kobo to 14.00 naira, the same price at which Union Bank closed, losing 20 kobo.</p>
<p>But Nestle rose to 43.00 naira, up 25 kobo, after it adjusted on Monday for dividend payment and scrip issue.</p>
<p>The company is rising on its excellent year-end result which included a generous dividend, traders said.</p>
<p>Another food share, Flour Mills rose 10 kobo to 15.90 naira in anticipation of a good result.</p>
<p>Hospital group Ekocorp finished higher, buoyed by an announcement that it had bought an ultra sound scanning machine which is expected to increase revenue by three million naira monthly. It closed five kobo more at 4.50 naira.</p>
<p>Other gainers included BOC, formerly Industrial Gases, and Texaco which both ended five kobo up at 13.80 naira and 49.35 naira, respectively.</p>
