<p>British Defence Minister Michael Portillo warned Bosnian leaders on Saturday that more reconstruction aid depended on sticking to the Dayton peace plan.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, there are pressures that can be brought to bear,&quot; Portillo said on a visit to Bosnia to see first-hand how British troops were helping to keep the peace.</p>
<p>He praised political progress made since the Dayton peace agreement at the end of 1995 but conceded that permanent peace was impossible until indicted war criminals had been arrested.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot expect an enduring settlement in Bosnia if those indicted of war crimes are allowed to go free,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>NATO commanders, eager to avoid a backlash against their troops, say NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR) soldiers will arrest any of the 70 indicted war criminals if they encounter them during the course of their normal duties but have ruled out tracking down suspects.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent war crime suspects, former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, was spotted last month by U.N. police monitors in a motorcade in Pale, outside Sarajevo.</p>
<p>Critics say post-war reconciliation between Bosnia's Moslems, Croats and Serbs will be impossible unless indicted war criminals are extradited to The Hague.</p>
<p>Portillo conceded there was a dilemma. &quot;We are between a rock and a hard place. We don't believe we can have a peace without their arrest but we recognise their arrest could be a flashpoint.&quot;</p>
<p>Portillo, whose visit to Bosnia was sharply curtailed by atrocious weather, said he hoped NATO's 31,000-strong SFOR force could complete its mandate within the next 18 months.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;It's a bit like a forest fire. The ashes could still be glowing in 18 months and they could be fanned back into flames.&quot;</p>
<p>At a news conference in Banja Luka, he was quick to deliver the same message announced at last month's Bosnia conference in London.</p>
<p>Portillo said it was essential that human rights were recognised and freedom of movement re-established.</p>
<p>Asked if the civil authorities were dragging their feet, he said: &quot;Yes, in some respects that is undoubtedly so.&quot;</p>
<p>He complained that it was easier to telephone from London to Sydney than it was from Banja Luka to Sarajevo.</p>
<p>&quot;It is really intolerable that any block should be put in the way of establishing the normal infrastructure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Portillo refused to paint a rosy picture.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite political progress, I don't think there is much progress in reconciliation...There is precious little sign of the population wishing to tolerate each other,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the great challenges this year is if political progress continues, will people want to go home in continuing numbers?&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;What is still very worrying is what is happening at village and town level.&quot;</p>
