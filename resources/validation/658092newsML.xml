<p>Australian shares opened firmer on Thursday, the market's early gains underpinned by News Corp forging ahead after announcing a deal to sell its U.S. satellite interests and buy a U.S. children's TV group.</p>
<p>At 10.25 a.m. (0025 GMT), the All Ordinaries index was 15 points firmer at 2,628.7.</p>
<p>The June share price index was eight points up at 2,636 and at a 7.3 point premium to the underlying index.</p>
<p>Both News Corp ordinary and preferred stock rallied early after the announcement which came after the Wall Street close but before the open of the local market.</p>
<p>&quot;The (News Corp) announcement has removed a number of question marks hanging over the company in terms of its satellite interests,&quot; a Melbourne-based dealer said.</p>
<p>The dealer said the market was also pleased that the media company had decided to use cash to acquire to buy the children's cable television and entertainment group, International Family Entertainment Inc (IFE), instead of the preferred stock which the company has used in its last few acquisitions.</p>
<p>&quot;The News Corp deal has fired up the whole market. It is proving to be the right tonic after yesterday's disappointing session,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>Apart from News Corp, investor interest was focused on the bank sector with the four majors all solid.</p>
<p>Dealers said Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd surged early on renewed rumours that a foreign bank was about to launch a takeover offer the bank.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the old rumour about a foreign takeover again but I notice that there are plenty of investors happy to sell into the rally,&quot; said a dealer from Daiwa Securities.</p>
<p>ANZ shares were 48 cents higher at A$9.70 (US$7.28) after earlier touching a record high of A$10.00.</p>
<p>The resources sector trailed industrials which were bolstered by the strong performance from the bank and media sectors. But amongst resources, Rio Tinto Ltd was favoured after it rose in London on talk of analyst upgrades.</p>
<p>Nickel and gold producer and explorer Highlands Pacific made a steady debut, its stock opening and holding its issue price of A$1.00 on light volume for a new listing.</p>
<p>Few major stocks opened lower, the small list including oil and gas group Woodside Petroleum, tobacco company Rothmans Holdings Ltd and volatile drug developer Cortecs International Ltd.</p>
<p>(A$1=US$0.75)</p>
