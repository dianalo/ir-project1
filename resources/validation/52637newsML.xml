<title>MEXICO: Mexico Cetes rates end firm on late speculators.</title>
<headline>Mexico Cetes rates end firm on late speculators.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1996-09-13</dateline>

<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates reversed earlier declines to close up 15 basis points at 23.15 percent as late speculators were able to grab higher rates from traders eager to unload paper ahead of a long weekend, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;What happened at the close is that people who were liquid and had hung on to their money stepped in to buy, and dealers had to sell off paper at cheap prices,&quot; a floor trader said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market was stable for most of the day, and pointed out that foreign buyers stepped into the term market to buy paper longer than 28 days.  </p>
<p>&quot;They were taking advantage of returns that Cetes are paying right now, before they go down next week. It seems it was worth their while staying invested over the long weekend,&quot; said a money market analyst.</p>
<p>Mexican markets will be closed on Monday for the Independence Day holiday.</p>
<p>Foreign demand caused both 91-day and 182-day Cetes rates to close 70 basis points down at 26.80 percent and 28.30 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Primary Cetes rates are expected to fall by between 50 and 150 basis points at next week's central bank auction.  </p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile closed 40 basis points up.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico earlier offset liquidity shortages and injected 3.786 billion pesos into the secondary market by auctioning three credits.</p>
<p>Brokers estimated that liquidity shortages will total some 4.5 billion pesos when the markets open again next Tuesday. Bank credit maturities will total 5.5 billion pesos, but government expenditure of 1.0 billion pesos is also expected.</p>
