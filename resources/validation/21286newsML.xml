<p>The first shipment of U.S. military equipment pledged to Moslem-Croat forces in Bosnia was scheduled to arrive by air in Sarajevo on Thursday, an American diplomat said.</p>
<p>U.S. special envoy James Pardew told reporters three commercial aircraft would bring 1,000 M-16 rifles, 200 machine- guns, 200 tactical radios and ammunition into the city over three days, beginning on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>The delivery is a small down payment against a far larger shipment, by sea, which is expected in Bosnia by mid-March.</p>
<p>The U.S. is providing a total of 46,100 M16 rifles, 1,000 M60 machine-guns, 45 M60A3 Main Battle tanks, 80 armoured personnel carriers, 15 utility helicopters, 840 anti-tank weapons and ammunition.</p>
<p>A military training component is also included in the programme, whose total value is $100 million.</p>
<p>Other nations are providing equipment to federation forces as well, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Pardew said Egypt had pledged on Thursday to supply 12 130mm field guns, 12 howitzers and 18 anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<p>&quot;As you know one of the greatest weaknesses in Bosnia during the war was the inability to respond effectively to artillery shelling of Sarajevo and other population centres,&quot; the U.S. envoy said.</p>
<p>&quot;This Egyptian contribution will begin to give the federation the means to overcome that weakness.&quot;</p>
<p>The purpose of the Train and Equip programme is to give Bosnia's Moslem-Croat federation, which controls 51 percent of the country, the means to deter aggression and defend its territory.</p>
<p>Bosnia's Serb republic administers the other 49 percent of the country and the federation is being armed against the potential threat posed by that entity's military forces which were superior in firepower.</p>
<p>Bosnian Moslem, Serb and Croat forces fought one another in a 43-month war which ended in December 1995 with the signing of the Dayton peace agreement.</p>
<p>Moslems and Croats are now bound together in a shaky federation brokered and largely held together through U.S. diplomacy.</p>
<p>It was only after federation officials agreed to merge separate Moslem and Croat-led armies as a single fighting force that the Americans agreed to move forward with Train and Equip.</p>
<p>The U.S. envoy expressed disappointment at continuing delays in implementing the joint forces agreement but said he had received recent assurances from senior officials that the project would proceed as promised.</p>
<p>Pardew said NATO-led peace forces would inspect Thursday's arms shipment when it arrived at the airport and after it was stored in a federation arms depot to ensure it was handled in accordance with the terms of the Dayton accord.</p>
