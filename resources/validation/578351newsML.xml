<headline>BASEBALL-GREG MADDUX WINS FOURTH STRAIGHT AS BRAVES POUND BUCS.</headline>
<dateline>PITTSBURGH 1997-05-12</dateline>

<p>Greg Maddux won his fourth straight decision and Atlanta continued its torrid scoring as the Braves routed the Pittsburgh Pirates 10-2 Monday to take the final three games of their four-game series.</p>
<p>Maddux (4-1) pitched five innings and allowed a run and six hits. He walked none and struck out seven. He improved to 13-13 in his career against Pittsburgh, leaving Cincinatti as the only National League team he has a losing record against.</p>
<p>Maddux threw only 68 pitches before leaving with an eight-run lead. Relievers Alan Embree, Brad Clontz and Joe Borowski allowed just one run and six hits over the final four innings.</p>
<p>&quot;If I can save an inning here or there the only possible thing it can do is help,&quot; said Maddux. &quot;It's not going to hurt you. We scored a lot of runs. The guys picked me up, it was nice.&quot;</p>
<p>After getting shut out 9-0 in the series opener Friday, the Braves outscored the Pirates 27-7 in winning the last three contests, completing a 5-3 road trip.</p>
<p>Chipper Jones had three hits, including a home run and a double, and scored three runs for Atlanta.</p>
<p>&quot;I think what we read in the paper (and) seeing what we saw on TV about how well Pittsburgh was playing, we knew these last three ballgames we had to assert ourselves,&quot; said Jones.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems like the bats woke up. Pitching is always going to be there. They did an outstanding job the past three games.&quot;</p>
<p>Michael Tucker had a homer and scored twice for the Braves, who scored in double figures for the fifth time this season.</p>
<p>Former Brave Jason Schmidt (1-2) took the loss, giving up nine runs and 10 hits in only 4 2/3 innings.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh's Tony Womack went 2-for-3 to extend his hitting streak to 12 games and Keith Osik was 3-for-4 with two doubles and a run scored.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Dante Bichette homered and drove in four runs as the Colorado Rockies snapped a season-high five-game losing streak with a 9-2 victory over the Phillies.</p>
<p>John Burke pitched 2 2/3 scoreless innings of relief after coming on for starter Billy Swift in the third inning. Mike DeJean (1-0) then worked 3 2/3 perfect innings to notch his first major league win.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the longest I've ever pitched in professional baseball,&quot; said DeJean. &quot;When you're seven runs ahead, you've got to throw strikes and stay aggressive.&quot;</p>
<p>DeJean also collected his first career hit -- a double in the eighth -- in his first career at-bat.</p>
<p>Swift, who hasn't lost since April 2, departed due to a strained right pectoral muscle.</p>
<p>&quot;Swift can't throw across his body,&quot; said Rockies manager Don Baylor. &quot;It had subsided somewhat, but it has been lingering. We'll probably be putting him on the disabled list.&quot;</p>
<p>Bobby Munoz (1-5) gave up six runs -- five earned -- and nine hits with no walks and two strikeouts over 2 2/3 innings, his shortest start of the season.</p>
<p>&quot;My confidence is a little down,&quot; said Munoz. &quot;But I've got to keep striving to get better. I have to try to get over it now and not let it carry over to my next game. If there's a next start, great. If there's not, there's not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes Bobby masks his emotions,&quot; said Phillies manager Terry Francona. &quot;So it's hard to tell how he feels. I hope he believes in himself because if he doesn't, then we have a problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Gregg Jefferies provided Philadelphia's lone runs in the third with a two-run homer -- his second of the year and 100th of his career.</p>
<p>At Florida, Moises Alou had three hits, including a pair of doubles, and scored three times and Rob Stanifer won his first major-league decision as the Marlins defeated the Houston Astros 11-4.</p>
<p>Trailing 3-1 in the fourth, the Marlins capitalised on an error by Houston second baseman Craig Biggio and rallied for five runs.</p>
<p>Florida loaded the bases with one out against Astros starter Shane Reynolds (4-3), who induced pinch-hitter Jim Eisenreich to ground into a potential inning-ending double play. But Biggio let the ball roll through his legs, allowing Bobby Bonilla and Jeff Conine to score.</p>
<p>&quot;The ball stayed down low,&quot; said Biggio. &quot;I thought I was low enough. That was a big play and it turned the game around.&quot;</p>
<p>The Marlins improved to a major-league leading 17-5 at home.</p>
<p>Stanifer (1-0) allowed a home run to Ricky Gutierrez and five hits over 2 1/3 innings of relief. He also picked up his first major-league hit in the sixth.</p>
<p>Derek Bell went 3-for-4 with a homer, triple and a single for the Astros.</p>
