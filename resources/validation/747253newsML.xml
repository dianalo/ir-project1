<p>Families of the 335 victims of Italy's worst World War Two atrocity waited with bated breath on Tuesday for the verdict in a sensational trial of two former Nazi SS officers.</p>
<p>&quot;All I'm hoping for is justice and a lesson in morality for young people,&quot; Giulia Spizzichino, who lost seven male relatives in the March 1944 Ardeatine Caves massacre, told Reuters.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel in a military courtroom in Rome's Rebibbia prison earlier retired to consider its verdict on former Nazi captain Erich Priebke and Karl Hass, who held the rank of major. Both are accused of complicity in the killings.</p>
<p>The verdict is not expected before 4 p.m. (1400 GMT).</p>
<p>Many relatives of the victims consider the trial a second chance for Italy to put the record straight after a first war crimes trial last year ended in uproar and embarrassment.</p>
<p>&quot;This is another shot to get it right because the whole world came down on them last time,&quot; said Robert Katz, a U.S. historian of the Nazi period.</p>
<p>The Ardeatine Caves massacre has revived painful memories of the Nazi occupation. SS officers rounded up 335 men and boys, including 75 Jews, and took them to the caves, south of Rome, where they shot them in reprisal for a partisan attack.</p>
<p>Priebke was the sole defendant in an often chaotic first trial that ended on August 1 last year. A military court, split 2-1 (corrects split and number of judges on panel from &quot;2-3&quot; to &quot;2-1&quot;), decided that the 83-year-old German was guilty but should not be punished because of a statute of limitations -- in other words, too much time had elapsed since the original crime.</p>
<p>Protesters laid siege to the courtroom, where Priebke was arrested hours later. The verdict was later quashed on appeal.</p>
<p>&quot;What the judges are deciding now is how politically to present it (the verdict),&quot; said Shimon Samuels, Director of International Affairs for the Los Angeles based Simon Wiesenthal Center that specialises in tracking ex-Nazis.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't want to repeat what happened last year...What it looks like it's going to be is a condemnation but with clemency due to age,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Priebke turns 84 next week and Hass is a year older. Both men have been held under house arrest during the trial.</p>
<p>The prosecution has demanded a life sentence for Priebke and 24 years for Hass, saying Priebke's crimes were aggravated by cruelty, brutality and premeditation, while Hass could claim mitigating circumstances.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the victims' families want five life sentences for each of the two Germans. The defence wants them set free.</p>
<p>Priebke was extradited in November 1995 from Argentina, where he lived openly for nearly half a century.</p>
<p>Hass was a reluctant prosecution witness in Priebke's first trial, but broke his pelvis trying to flee to avoid giving evidence and eventually testified from his hospital bed.</p>
<p>He was arrested after admitting that he also took part in the massacre. Both men have admitted they each shot two victims and Priebke has said he also ticked names off a list.</p>
<p>But both have said they were obeying orders, and would have been shot themselves had they refused.</p>
<p>Spizzichino said she had felt &quot;much hope&quot; during the trial, which began in April. &quot;But today I'm prepared for the worst.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that this time Italy's moral health will prevail,&quot; said Rosina Stame, who lost her husband at the caves. &quot;The whole world is watching. Either way, my bitterness remains.&quot;</p>
<p>Katz summed up the feelings of many of the victims' families, gathered at the courtroom to await the verdict.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't see how they could not find (Priebke) guilty to the fullest extent,&quot; he said. &quot;But then again, I thought so last time as well.&quot;</p>
