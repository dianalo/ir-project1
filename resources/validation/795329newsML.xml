<p>Just a short walk from its famous twin-towered cathedral, a mighty symbol of Cologne's proud history, lies a reminder of the city's darkest days.</p>
<p>The building which housed the regional headquarters of the Nazis' secret police, the Gestapo, is a sobering sight.</p>
<p>The premises survived the Allied bombing raids that destroyed most of the centre, but their grisly history was quickly forgotten in the aftermath of World War Two.</p>
<p>Now the building has re-opened as a documentation centre and memorial to the victims of the Nazis' reign of terror in the Rhineland from 1933 to 1945.</p>
<p>The cells in the basement have been preserved, complete with chilling inscriptions from prisoners tortured by the Gestapo.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm now 18 years old, pregnant and would like to see the first child from my own womb. But it won't happen. I must die,&quot; one Russian prisoner wrote on a wall.</p>
<p>The centre serves as a reminder to the Rhineland that Nazism was not confined to cities more readily associated with the fascist movement like Berlin, Nuremberg and Munich.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a widely held view in Cologne that it wasn't so bad here, that Cologne people were laconic, liberal and always against authoritarianism,&quot; said the centre's curator Horst Matzerath.</p>
<p>&quot;However, you have to recognise that what happened elsewhere also happened here. Jews were excluded, Gypsies were deported.&quot;</p>
<p>SECRET HISTORY</p>
<p>Rhinelanders generally view themselves as more irreverent than other Germans, pointing to traditions such as Cologne's huge annual carnival, where parodies of the powerful abound.</p>
<p>Mazerath says there is some evidence -- such as relatively poor results for the Nazis in 1933 elections that brought Hitler to power -- to back up the claim that Cologne and the Rhineland were not as keen on Nazism as other parts of Germany.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;There are things which have to be recognised as shades of difference in a system where intolerance was everywhere and from which Cologne was not excluded&quot;.</p>
<p>The history of the old Gestapo building reflects the city's slowness to come to terms with its Nazi past.</p>
<p>As one of the few structures not completely destroyed by blanket Allied bombing, it was quickly put to good use straight after the end of the war.</p>
<p>It was home to the Swiss consulate just a few months after the Gestapo fled the besieged city in March 1945 and then housed public administration offices for decades.</p>
<p>The building's history was unknown to the vast majority of the city's residents.</p>
<p>A small group of activists campaigned to open up the basement, where the cells were still intact, and turn the whole building into a memorial for the victims of Nazi terror.</p>
<p>After years of campaigning, which culminated in some activists occupying the building and locking themselves into the basement, the city finally agreed.</p>
<p>The cells were opened up in 1981, giving the people of Cologne a first glimpse of the past they had long denied.</p>
<p>Now, with the opening of a large permanent exhibition on the upper floors after more than a year of renovation work, visitors have the chance to gain a comprehensive view of life in Cologne under Hitler.</p>
<p>CITY UNDER THE SWASTIKA</p>
<p>The exhibition makes extensive use of the statements, both written and on tape, of Cologne people who remember the Nazis.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw Adolf Hitler myself in Cologne in 1936. People were really taken with him and the city was like a sea of flags,&quot; one man recalls.</p>
<p>&quot;He promised peace and order and, in the eyes of my parents, he brought both. You could go into the centre of Cologne again without any worries,&quot; another witness remembers.</p>
<p>The building was extensively renovated over the years and no plans exist of its layout in the Gestapo days.</p>
<p>So architects have created a new design while trying to maintain some elements, such as the ominous long corridors, which survivors remember from the old headquarters.</p>
<p>Photographs demonstrate how Nazism intruded on everyday life in a city few readily associate with Hitler's regime.</p>
<p>One picture shows soldiers marching past the cathedral with huge crowds looking on and another shows a mother pushing a baby in its pram, complete with swastika flag.</p>
<p>Matzerath said one of the centre's main aims was to educate Cologne's young people about a period they may be ignorant of.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to show them these aren't distant subjects but things that happened in places they know and to raise their determination not to let the same thing happen again,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>CRIES FOR HELP</p>
<p>While the collection of pictures, testimonies, propaganda films and official documents is impressive, the cells best bring home the fear of Hitler's Third Reich.</p>
<p>The tiny prisons, measuring about 5.2 square metres, and the words on their walls document the desperation of their inhabitants, including Jews, foreigners and resistance fighters.</p>
<p>The cries for help -- not just words, but also pictures of objects such as hearts and faces -- were scrawled with pencils, pieces of coal, chalk, lipstick and even fingernails.</p>
<p>Russian, Ukrainian, French, Flemish and Polish, as well as German, are among the languages of the graffiti, which document how conditions grew increasingly grim as the war wore on.</p>
<p>One inscription talks of 33 prisoners being held in a single cell. Summary executions became commonplace.</p>
<p>&quot;Today is March 3, 1945. Forty people were hanged. We've been here 43 days, the interrogation is coming to an end, now it's our turn for the gallows,&quot; one Russian inscription says.</p>
<p>&quot;I ask those who know us to tell our comrades we died in these torture chambers.&quot;</p>
