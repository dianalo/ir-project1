<title>USA: Stainless prices could start recovering - analysts.</title>

<p>The stainless steel price hike announced this week by Allegheny Teledyne Inc could be the start of a slow but steady price recovery for U.S. producers, who have seen prices plummet during the past year and dampen earnings, analysts said.</p>
<p>But some cautioned that higher U.S. pricing hinges on recovery in the European market, where prices remain significantly below U.S. tags.</p>
<p>Chuck Bradford at UBS Securities said European producers are planning to raise tags on flat-rolled stainless products in January. &quot;If that sticks, the U.S. increase will too,&quot; he said. &quot;If they don't get the January increase, the U.S. increase may not hold.&quot;</p>
<p>Allegheny Teledyne on Wednesday said it plans to raise prices by about five percent on stainless sheet, strip and plate effective with March shipments.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for their U.S. competitors, Armco Inc, J&amp;L Specialty Steel Inc, and Lukens Inc said they were studying the move. Analysts said they will likely support the increase.</p>
<p>U.S. stainless prices have plummeted in the past year due to import pressure. Imports, primarily from Europe and Asia, have flooded the more lucrative U.S. market because prices in their home markets have been depressed.</p>
<p>Prices for foreign material have been about 20 percent below U.S. tags.</p>
<p>The four U.S. producers all posted lower third-quarter earnings this year from a year ago, blaming the results on sluggish pricing.</p>
<p>Producers attempted to raise prices in the second quarter but rescinded their five percent increase due to continuing import pressure.</p>
<p>However, analysts said foreign prices are slowly starting to rise, which should help U.S. producers raise prices next year.</p>
<p>&quot;I think (the March increase) will stick,&quot; said Mike Gambardella at JP Morgan Securities. &quot;The European market is coming off of a bottom and the impact of that will be felt in the U.S. five to six months later.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to believe that the European stainless market has bottomed out and the outlook for 1997 and 1998 looks positive.&quot;</p>
<p>A purchasing manager at a large steel service center said he has had fewer offerings for foreign material, which could mean foreign prices are indeed strengthening. But he said there is still oversupply in the market, raising doubts about whether U.S. producers will be able to boost tags next year.</p>
<p>&quot;There's still a lot of material out there,&quot; he said. He said the fact that Allegheny Teledyne scheduled the increase for the first quarter rather than sooner could mean they are not confident it will hold in the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Personally I don't see it happening,&quot; he said. &quot;To call for an increase four months out...it looks like there's not a lot of confidence.&quot;</p>
