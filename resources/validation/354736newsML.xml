<p>The Bank of Canada is unlikely to match any increase in U.S. interest rates in coming months as long as the Canadian dollar maintains its recent strength, economists said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Canada's central bank could even keep short-term interest rates at current levels for a year or more assuming further strength in the dollar and a moderate rise in U.S. rates.</p>
<p>&quot;If the international environment remains friendly, Canadian short-term rates can stay at these levels for an awfully long time,&quot; said Jim Webber, director of fixed-income research with TD Securities Inc. &quot;I don't see any reason why they have to go up for at least two years.&quot;</p>
<p>Speculation about the impact of a U.S. rate hike on Canadian monetary policy returned to financial markets this week with the meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>While few economists expect the Fed to hike rates rates at the end of the meeting on Wednesday, most expect U.S. rates to rise before year end.</p>
<p>A large amount of slack in the Canadian economy and a steadily appreciating dollar are seen as the main factors likely to prevent the Bank of Canada from initially matching a U.S. rate hike.</p>
<p>&quot;With inflation where it is and with the economy just getting going on a recovery I can't see that they would be in any kind of a rush to raise rates,&quot; Webber said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Canada confirmed on Tuesday that the economic fundamentals that brought short-term Canadian interest rates to their lowest point in decades remained intact.</p>
<p>In its winter review, the bank said that the output gap, the room that the economy has to grow before sparking inflationary pressures, would narrow but not disappear in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;With the amount of excess supply in the economy remaining large, the trend of inflation is expected to stay in the lower part of the inflation-control target range of 1 to 3 percent in coming months,&quot; the central bank said.</p>
<p>The central bank forecast that Canadian economic growth would accelerate in coming quarters, prompted by increased household spending and business investment. But economists said that growth would be tempered by the country's high unemployment rate and weak consumer confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;You're getting the fuel from the lower interest rates but you're not getting gains in disposible income to really fuel the consumer,&quot; said Dan Kelly, CIBC Wood Gundy Securities' director of financial markets research. &quot;Things are definitely improving, but they're not going to get excessive.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bank of Canada would more likely use a strengthening currency than higher interest rates to temper economic growth in Canada over the next year, said Webber. A stronger currency acts as a brake on the economy by making Canadian exports less attractive abroad.</p>
<p>Economists said the likelihood of the Bank of Canada holding steady in the face of a U.S. rate hike was conditional on several factors.</p>
<p>One was that the Canadian dollar did not sell off after a U.S. rate hike. Analysts said the Bank of Canada would tolerate a moderate decline in the currency after a Fed tightening, but a sharp decline would be met with a similar hike in Canadian rates.</p>
<p>The Bank of Canada could also only hold steady amid a moderate Fed tightening of one-half to three-quarters of a percentage point, Kelly said. A 1.5 to 2 percentage point rise in U.S. rates would force Canada to follow suit or risk a sell-off in the currency, he said.</p>
