<p>A Chinese dissident in a labour camp in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou has been seriously injured in a three-storey fall which police have characterised as a suicide attempt, his sister said on Monday.</p>
<p>Chen Longde was sentenced last month to three years re-education in a labour camp for &quot;endangering national security&quot; by sending a petition to the Chinese parliament in May demanding the release of political prisoners.</p>
<p>&quot;The police rang us today and said that he jumped from the third floor in a suicide attempt,&quot; his sister Chen Xiaoying told Reuters by telephone. &quot;They said it happened on August 17 and they only contacted us today.&quot;</p>
<p>Re-education through labour is an administrative punishment with a maximum of three years that can be imposed by police without recourse to prosecutors or the courts.</p>
<p>Police told Chen Xiaoying her brother had suffered broken bones in his pelvis and broken teeth.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no way he attempted suicide,&quot; she said. &quot;He wouldn't do that.&quot;</p>
<p>She said in the phone call from the police the family had repeatedly demanded to know whether or not Chen had been beaten prior to the incident, and the police official had denied it.</p>
<p>She said the family had been given permission to visit Chen at a hospital in Hangzhou on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Chen, aged 39, had been jailed for three years for his role in student-led democracy demonstrations centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square which were crushed by the army on June 4, 1989.</p>
<p>Hangzhou police could not be immediately contacted for comment.</p>
