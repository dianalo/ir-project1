<p>A left-wing surge in Sundays first round of French parliamentary elections could put the future of unpopular Prime Minister Alain Juppe on the line as President Jacques Chirac seeks to salvage his presidency.</p>
<p>A big protest vote against austerity and record unemployment showed Chirac's gamble in calling a snap election could blow up in his face, with the left within reach of a majority in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The combined left outpolled the right, but the final outcome of the battle remained wide open with most of the Assembly's 577 seats to be decided in next Sunday's runoff.</p>
<p>That leaves Chirac facing the dilemma of whether to jettison fellow Gaullist Juppe, his closest associate, or risk being turned prematurely into a lame-duck president by another wave of protest votes in a week's time.</p>
<p>The election turned to a significant extent into a referendum on the record and future of Juppe, 51, shown by some polls to be France's least popular post-war premier.</p>
<p>&quot;Juppe's unpopularity strongly contributed to this result,&quot; said Pascal Perrineau, director of the Centre for the Study of French Political Life.</p>
<p>Before the first round, several allies had urged Chirac to dump Juppe in favour of ex-prime minister Edouard Balladur or outgoing National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin, yet no one made such a public call on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Ministers were summoned to Juppe's office on Sunday to &quot;coordinate&quot; their televised statements as reports of the impending drubbing filtered in, political sources said.</p>
<p>In his election-night statement, Juppe acknowledged that voters had sent a message that they wanted change. But he seemed to suggest that he could stay on and embody that aspiration.</p>
<p>Chirac, 64, gambled the future of his presidency two years after taking office by calling an election 10 months ahead of schedule, seeking to ensure himself a friendly Assembly for the remaining five years of his term.</p>
<p>Sucess could make him the strongest European leader until well beyond the millennium. Failure would severely diminish his power, forcing him to &quot;cohabit&quot; with Socialist Lionel Jospin as prime minister unravelling Juppe's austerity policies.</p>
<p>The constitution bars Chirac from calling another election for at least a year.</p>
<p>His campaign warnings that &quot;cohabitation&quot; would weaken France's voice in Europe as it prepares to launch a single currency apparently failed to impress voters.</p>
<p>Before Sunday's vote, insiders said Chirac wanted to retain Juppe as premier.</p>
<p>But if he is to rally disgruntled conservatives and defuse widespread fears of more austerity, he may well have to send a signal before next Sunday's second round that he is prepared to pick a new premier, some analysts say.</p>
<p>The nearest anyone came on Sunday night to hinting Juppe should go was when some centrists in the UDF junior coalition party called for &quot;a new team&quot; to heed what they called the voters' warning.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have to govern in a different way, to explain policies in a different way with a team that will take into account the warning that was delivered tonight,&quot; UDF Urban Affairs Minister Jean-Claude Gaudin said.</p>
<p>&quot;French voters wanted to tell us to change...This will be decided this week,&quot; said UDF Education Minister Francois Bayrou.</p>
<p>Seguin, a Eurosceptical Gaullist shown in opinion polls to be the voters' favourite for the premiership if the right wins, refused to comment on Juppe's future.</p>
<p>&quot;The French people wanted to send us a message. We must hear it,&quot; the premier's longtime rival said. &quot;As to changing the team, this is a matter for the president alone.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite his brilliance, Juppe is widely criticised as cold, authoritarian, uncaring of ordinary citizens and poor at explaining his policies to the public.</p>
<p>Pollsters had said Juppe, who fared poorly in his own constituency, might need a clear win to keep the job Chirac gave him in the wake of his own election two years ago.</p>
<p>Leftists, painting him as the embodiment of austerity, blamed him personally for failing to curb record 12.8 percent unemployment and warned voters of &quot;five more years of Juppe&quot;.</p>
<p>Perhaps preparing an escape hatch for himself, Juppe hinted during the campaign that he might be happy to go, although he was willing to stay on.</p>
<p>If forced to choose between the premiership and his job as mayor of Bordeaux, he said, he would prefer Bordeaux.</p>
