<title>ROMANIA: Bucharest bourse to get three more stocks.</title>
<headline>Bucharest bourse to get three more stocks.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1997-02-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Three Romanian companies will join the Bucharest bourse this week, bringing to 23 the total number of traded stocks, the exchange said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It said the newcomers were  Cercom Ariesul SA, a building materials company,  Armatura SA, which produces plumbing equipment, and  Dorobantul SA, a wool and fibre maker. Their shares will start second-tier trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>Cercom is a private company with a capital of 14 billion lei in shares with a nominal value of 25,000 lei each.</p>
<p>It was privatised under a mass selloff launched in 1995, with 53.7 percent of its equity subscribed for in exchange for coupons. Cercom staff hold 40 percent and the State Ownership Fund (FPS) -- its majority owner before the mass selloff -- has 6.3 percent.</p>
<p>Armatura has a share capital of 15.2 billion lei, or 15.2 million shares with a face value of 1,000 each. It went private in the mass selloff, with 60 percent acquired against coupons and 40 percent bought by its staff, a bourse statement said.</p>
<p>It said Dorobantul, the third stock to join the market, had a share capital of 24 billion lei in shares of 1,000 lei each. Individual shareholders have 61.25 percent and the FPS holds 38.75 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the newcomers to appeal to investors as they are private companies,&quot; a trader said. &quot;Their joining the market will help increase liquidity.&quot;</p>
<p>Another stock --  Mefin SA fine mechanics company -- is expected to enter the bourse's second tier next week.</p>
<p>The bourse has only two first-tier listings -- Azomures SA fertiliser maker, which has dominated the bourse since it opened late in 1995, and  Oltchim SA chemical plant, which joined the market on Tuesday.</p>
