<p>President Bill Clinton, his wife Hillary and Vice President Al Gore telephoned ex-campaign adviser Dick Morris &quot;just to check on a friend going through an ordeal,&quot; the White House said on Friday.</p>
<p>As Clinton began a two-day bus tour, White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters the phone calls were made on Thursday afternoon, hours after Morris resigned from the campaign after a sensationalist supermarket tabloid said he had a year-long affair with a prostitute and had confided White House secrets to her.</p>
<p>McCurry declined to give details of the call, saying: &quot;It was a private conversation and I didn't ask them to relay the details. They were brief phone calls just to check on a friend going through an ordeal.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if Clinton had put the Morris imbroglio behind him, McCurry told reporters, &quot;We have. Whether you have remains to be seen.&quot;</p>
