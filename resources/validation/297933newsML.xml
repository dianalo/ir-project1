<p>The won finished lower versus the dollar on Thursday despite the central bank's repeated attempts to save the falling won, traders said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Korea stepped in throughout the day to support the won. But the bank denied the move as it regularly does.</p>
<p>The won ended at 846.80, after opening at an intraday high of 845.00. The intraday low of 847.10 was the lowest level since South Korea started interbank trading in March 1990.</p>
<p>Dealers said pressure from heavy import deals pushed the won down through the 845 level, which the central bank saw as a short-term ceiling for the dollar.  </p>
<p>They said snowballing labour strikes in protest at a new labour law, which have been hurting the nation's exports, also kept the won buyers sidelined.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is likely to climb further with large import settlements scheduled for early next week,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The base mid-rate is seen at 846.80 for Friday, compared with 844.80 on Thursday.</p>
