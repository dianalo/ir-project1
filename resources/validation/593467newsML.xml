<p>Vietnam's most powerful women gather this week to gently push for sexual equality, a tenet of Marxist-Leninist thought the communist nation still struggles to match with its Confucian heritage of female subservience.</p>
<p>&quot;Right on Sisters!&quot; bawled the weekly Vietnam Courier in the headline of a scene-setting report on the Eighth National Congress of the Women's Union, a two-day event which will open on Monday.</p>
<p>In reality, the rhetoric of militant feminism is likely to go unheard at a gathering which has been timed to coincide with the birthday of a man -- modern Vietnam's founding father and revolutionary, Ho Chi Minh.</p>
<p>&quot;Vietnam is an oriental country and we preserve the traditional role of women,&quot; Truong My Hoa, President of the Women's Union, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I think...we can avoid the excessive trends of other countries,&quot; she said, referring to brazen acts of emancipation in the West in the 1960s such as the burning of bras. &quot;Those obscene acts would be very strange in our country.&quot;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hoa said that the congress -- which is held once every five years -- would set out a new agenda to empower women, promote their education and health and lift them out of poverty.</p>
<p>Founded in 1930, the Women's Union played a key role in Vietnam's long and bitter struggle for independence, but switched its focus to gender issues after the Vietnam War ended in 1975.</p>
<p>Now, with a membership of 11 million people -- five times that of the ruling Communist Party -- it is one of the country's most influential and far-reaching mass organisations.</p>
<p>In terms of gender equality, Vietnam already has a good head start on many other Asian nations.</p>
<p>Inspired by the emphasis that the late Ho Chi Minh placed on the role and potential of women, the post-war government has demonstrated a strong commitment to an even-handed treatment of both sexes in education, health-care and participation in the labour force.</p>
<p>Although women are still poorly represented in the upper echelons of government, they still do better than their sisters in other countries and look set to gain more ground.</p>
<p>There are 73 women in the lawmaking National Assembly, 18.5 percent of the total. Only 12 of the 173 countries in the World Parliamentary Union can boast a higher rate, and women have been given a quota of 25 percent for the new assembly which will be elected in July.</p>
<p>However, the official policy of equality still clashes with centuries-old Confucian values, which essentially hold that women should work hard and obey their fathers, husbands and sons.</p>
<p>According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Vietnam's achievements in gender equality are being eroded and those values are being reasserted in the process of market reform.</p>
<p>It argues that young girls and women are working longer hours and on an increasing number of tasks, particularly in rural areas, often at the expense of leisure, education and careers.</p>
<p>&quot;Researchers estimate that women carry out about 60 percent of the agricultural workload on top of household work,&quot; the UNDP says in a fact sheet on the advancement of women. &quot;Yet, across the board...women earn only 72 percent of the average male wage.&quot;</p>
<p>Heather Grady, country representative of the charity Oxfam, says the society's natural prejudice means women are regularly losers in the economic reform process.</p>
<p>Women are often the first victims of redundancy at state-owned firms which are feeling the cold wind of free-market competition. And it is nearly always the name of a man, not his wife, that appears on the title deed for land once owned collectively.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a question of rhetoric versus reality,&quot; she says. &quot;Things aren't going to change until there's a change in perspective on gender.&quot;</p>
