<p>DOWNER EXPRESSES CONCERN OVER MERCENARY HIRE</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has told Parliament the Australian Government remains deeply concerned at the possible use of mercenaries on the island of Bouganville.</p>
<p>The PNG Government's come under intense criticism over its hiring of military personnel from the South African based company, Executive Outcomes.</p>
<p>PNG's Prime Minister, Sir Julius Chan, has denied the soldiers are mercenaries, claiming they'll simply be used to train PNG troops.</p>
<p>Mr Downer's called in PNG High Commissioner to express Australia's concern, and seek urgent clarificantion from the PNG Government of remarks made by Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan.</p>

<p>RATE CUT UNLIKELY AFTER SMALL WAGES GROWTH REDUCTION</p>
<p>Economists says another cut in interest rates in the short-term is unlikely, following a slight reduction in the pace of wages growth under enterprise bargaining late last year.</p>
<p>The Department of Industrial Relations says the average pay rises negotiated in federal agreements in the December quarter dropped 0.4 percent to 4.4 percent.</p>
<p>Private sector rises were almost one per cent down on the previous quarter, which was largely because of tight conditions in the retail sector.</p>
<p>In other industries, such as construction and road transport, enterprise agreements provided up to 7.4 percent wage rises.</p>
<p>Chief Economist with GIO Australia, Akis Haralabopoulos, says economic growth this year will apply more pressure to wage agreements.</p>

<p>OPPOSITION WANTS CAR TARIFFS FROZEN</p>
<p>The Australian Manufacturers Union says an historic alliance has formed against a recommendation to cut tariffs on the car industry.</p>
<p>The Productivity Commission wants to see tariffs cut to five per cent in 2004.</p>
<p>But the Federal Opposition has launched a plan for the car industry which would see tariffs frozen at 15-per cent until at least 2005.</p>
<p>Opposition leader Kim Beazley, says the Commission's recommendation would wreck Australia's car industry, and Labor would also continue the Export Facilitation Scheme.</p>
<p>Paul Noack, of the Manufacturing Unionm says the Premiers of South Australia and Victoria, unions, car manufacturers and the Opposition leader, are now all locked in together against the tariff cuts.</p>
<p>And he's called on the Federal Government to take notice of them.</p>

<p>KENNETT: TAX BREAKS A WASTE OF TIME</p>
<p>Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett, says it remains to be seen whether the Federal Government's health insurance tax breaks will halt the decline in health fund membership.</p>
<p>But Mr Kennett has described the 600 million dollar scheme as a waste of money, because the funds have increased premiums since the incentives were introduced.</p>
<p>He says the Federal Government may have been hoping to increase fund membership, but now the best it can hope for is to stabilise the decline.</p>
<p>Mr Kennett says Australia's health system needs a circuit-breaker, or no Government will be able to meet the public's expectations.</p>

<p>GUNS INVOLVED IN MANY DEATHS</p>
<p>Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show firearms account for almost half of the murders and suicides throughout Australia.</p>
<p>The figures show firearms were involved in the deaths of more than 10-thousand people between 1980 and 1995, with the majority of deaths, almost eight-thousand, suicides.</p>
<p>Firearms were also used in the murders of 15-hundred people.</p>
<p>There were 700 accidental deaths, and a small number of fatal shootings by police in the line of duty.</p>
<p>The Bureau says since the end of the survey period, national gun laws have been introduced, following the Port Arthur massacre in which 35 people were killed.</p>

<p>AUSTRALIANS LIVING LONGER</p>
<p>New figures show Australians are living longer.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Statistics says in 1995 the average age at death for men was 73-and-a-half years, and 80-point-3 for women. But indigenous Australians continue to die at a much lower age.</p>
<p>The median age at death for indigenous people was between 49-and-54 years in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>No figures are available for other states.</p>
<p>Diseases of the circulatory system accounted for 46-per cent of all deaths in women and 40-per cent in men, while cancers caused 29-per cent of deaths in women and 25-percent for men.</p>
<p>The figures show Australians live longer on average than people in most developed countries except Japan.</p>

<p>ARNOTTS WORKING ROUND THE CLOCK TO RESTOCK SHELVES</p>
<p>A fleet of 180 trucks is at the vanguard of efforts by Arnott's to restock shelves in Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
<p>The company's biscuits were removed from shops almost two weeks ago because of an extortion attempt, which involved a threat to poison the products.</p>
<p>Managing Director, Chris Roberts, says he doesn't know how long it will take to get back to normal, because it's such a large geographical area, and the company makes a wide range of biscuits.</p>
<p>Mr Roberts says there are likely to be shortages for several weeks.</p>

<p>MAGNA THE SAFEST AUSSIE-MADE CAR</p>
<p>Government-sponsored crash tests have shown that airbags reduce the risk of head injury in accidents by at least half.</p>
<p>The Mitsubishi Magna was found to be the safest Australian-made family car.</p>
<p>The Magna, fitted with an optional drivers airbag was rated acceptable, after frontal crash testing at speeds of 56 and 64 kilometres-an-hour.</p>
<p>Without airbags, the Magna and the Toyota Camry were rated marginal, while the Holden Commodore without airbags rated poor. The imported Volvo 850 was the safest of all cars and was the only model to achieve a &quot;good&quot; rating.</p>
<p>Holden has dismissed the crash test results.</p>
<p>It says that laboratory tests provide data too limited to indicate safety in the real world.</p>
<p>And Holden says that the test information is also open to severe misinterpretation.</p>
