<p>The Guatemalan government and leftist rebels meet in Oslo this week to sign the first of several peace agreements to put an end to 36 years of bloody civil war.</p>
<p>Government officials and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG) were travelling to the Norwegian capital on Sunday for two days of talks to iron out last minute details of the ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p>The deal is due to be signed on Wednesday in Oslo's City Hall, where, fittingly, the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Peace Prize each year.</p>
<p>The ceremony follows more than five years of complex negotiations, which include 11 separate accords on everything from Indian rights, army troop reductions, constitutional and election reforms and the post-war political role of the URNG.</p>
<p>The peace process is scheduled to culminate in the signing of a final agreement on December 29 in Guatemala City and will bring to a close Latin America's longest civil war, in which more than 100,000 people, mainly civilians, have died and 40,000 have disappeared.</p>
<p>&quot;This will be more than a signature on paper. This is the end of the 'shooting' war between the two sides,&quot; Jan Egeland, Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It will end one of the bloodiest civil wars this generation and one of the worst abuses of human rights. This ceremony is a ceremony of conciliation.&quot;</p>
<p>Norway hosted an initial round of Guatemalan peace talks in 1990, before the United Nations took over as mediator. The Scandinavian country is a member of the so-called Group of Friends of Guatemala, which also comprises Colombia, Mexico, Spain, the United States and Venezuela.</p>
<p>&quot;This concludes a marathon of negotiations by the Guatemalan parties and the Norwegian government that has required several parallel peace processes at the same time,&quot; Egeland said.</p>
<p>The ceremony will be attended by government and URNG officials, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta Menchu and other &quot;witnesses of honour&quot;.</p>
<p>Menchu, a Mayan Indian, was awarded the 1992 Peace Prize in recognition of her struggle for human rights for the indigenous Guatemalan Indians. Her mother, father and a brother were killed by the military during the war.</p>
<p>Six key military figures, led by Defence Minister General Julio Balconi, have been invited to the signing in recognition of their &quot;courageous&quot; battle from within the army's ranks for peace and the protection of human rights, Egeland said.</p>
<p>Other guests will include the former leader of the organisation for Indian war widows, Rosalina Tuyuc, and Damiana Lopez, a 22-year-old teacher from the village of Tierra Colorada, where 80 percent of the residents died in the 1980s as a result of the conflict.</p>
<p>The government and rebels are scheduled to sign a deal on constitutional and election reforms in the Swedish capital Stockholm on December 7, before heading to Madrid on December 12 to complete the treaty on how to reinsert URNG guerrillas into civilian life.</p>
<p>Norway mediated secret negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation which led to the signing of the historic Oslo peace accords in 1993.</p>
<p>Norway sees itself as an honest broker in world affairs with no major strategic or economic interests in nations such as Israel or Guatemala.</p>
