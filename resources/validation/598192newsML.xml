<p>The dollar tumbled against most major currencies on Tuesday after Federal Reserve policymakers did not raise U.S. short-term interest rates as had been expected at their scheduled meeting.</p>
<p>A rate hike would have made yields on U.S. investments more attractive, giving the dollar a boost.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the dollar's slide surprised foreign exchange dealers and could mark the end of the dollar's two-year rise since hitting post-World War II lows against the German mark and yen in the spring of 1995, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking at the possibility of higher rates in Japan and this certainly doesn't help the dollar's overall trend (higher). It may confirm the end of that trend,&quot; said Kevin Lawrie, global manager of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Trade was fast and furious after the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended late on Tuesday with no official announcement -- a signal official interest rates remain unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is getting hit. We are going down hard,&quot; said Marc Chandler, senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, as the dollar began its slide.</p>
<p>By the U.S. close, the dollar fell over three pfennigs to 1.6760 marks from 1.7080 late Monday, almost three yen to 112.75 yen from 115.62. The dollar also tumbled against the Swiss franc to 1.3870 from 1.4275.</p>
<p>Polls ahead of the closely watched Fed meeting showed Wall Street was evenly divided on whether the Fed would raise rates to corral inflationary pressures. However, dealers said given the currency market's decisive reaction to the news of steady rates, the bias must have been for a rise in rates.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought the market was pretty evenly divided on this, but the fact is the market is following the path of least resistance,&quot; said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics.</p>
<p>Against the yen, the dollar has been on a downward spiral ever since hitting a 56-month high of 127.47 yen on May 1. In overseas trade, the dollar fell below 112 yen to its lowest level since December at 111.98 yen after news reports hinted at prospects for higher interest rates in Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese media reported that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party would recommend later this month that the Bank of Japan raise its offical discount rate from a current record low of 0.5 percent to keep capital from flowing out of the country following the liberalisation of trade laws.</p>
<p>Japanese finance authorities moved to halt the ensuing steep slide in the dollar, warning that the yen's rise was too rapid.</p>
<p>&quot;The pace of the yen's strengthening is too rapid,&quot; Eisuke Sakakibara, the director-general of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau told Reuters.</p>
<p>Sakakibara added that too much volatility in foreign exchange markets was undesirable and that Japan would &quot;deal appropriately&quot; with such excessive volatility.</p>
<p>His remarks helped push the dollar back above 113 yen before news of steady U.S. rates sent the dollar tumbling once again.</p>
<p>Gilmore said market talk of higher interest rates in Japan was &quot;more of an excuse to sell dollars than a reflection of economic reality&quot;.</p>
<p>In other trading, British sterling jumped to $1.6560 from $1.6395 and the dollar dipped to Canadian $1.3664 from C$1.3715.</p>
