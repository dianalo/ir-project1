<p>Less than three pfennigs away from the 3.00 mark level, sterling traders are beginning to ponder whether the Bank of England (BOE) might pull up its sleeves and cap the pound's rise.</p>
<p>Sterling's latest spurt on Tuesday to levels not seen since May 1991 prompted vague rumours the Bank of England had sold sterling at the highs at 2.9740 marks. The BOE did not commment.</p>
<p>Analysts dismissed the rumours but cited anecdotal evidence that the mood in the BOE's dealing room was getting more tense these days.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been no obvious intervention but the BOE's concern at the speed and extent of the sterling rally must be increasing,&quot; said Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN AMRO.</p>
<p>The latest rise in the pound was triggered by stronger than expected UK inflation for June. The underlying rate of retail price inflation jumped above the government's target figure of 2.5 percent to 2.7 percent.</p>
<p>The rise added fuel to feverish interest-rate rise speculation ahead of the Bank of England monetary policy council's two-day meeting starting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was no confirmation of central bank sales but small amounts of BOE sell orders for sterling/mark had been noted in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Several dealers also said other European central banks had been &quot;testing the waters&quot;, even though there was no sign of intervention at this stage.</p>
<p>UK interest rates have already risen three times since last October and speculation of another hike intensified after last week's budget from the new Labour government did little to restrain buoyant consumer demand.</p>
<p>Financial markets are expecting a quarter-point rise in base rates to 6.75 percent to be announced on Thursday, with some even betting on a 50 basis points increase.</p>
<p>With inflation rising above the government's target, the inflation hawks on the BOE committee are likely to sound the alarm bells even louder, analysts said.</p>
<p>But the dilemma faced by the BOE is that a rate rise might increase sterling's attractiveness even further and lead to more appreciation of the pound, much to the chagrin of British exporters.</p>
<p>The list of UK companies hurt by sterling's strength is growing almost daily. The latest reminder came on Tuesday from the Engineering Employers' Federation (EEF).</p>
<p>The EEF said export orders among British engineering firms fell to their lowest level in three years due to the effects of the strong pound.</p>
<p>&quot;If the BOE raises interest rates, the by-product is a stronger pound and there is no other way to solve that problem other than through intervention,&quot; said Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International.</p>
<p>&quot;It would make a lot of sense to intervene to cap the pound as it would ease some of the policy dilemma, but I doubt they will do it,&quot; said Lyons.</p>
<p>The risk of losing its anti-inflationary credibility looms large for the BOE if it foregoes an interest rate rise to stem the pound's rise, analysts said.</p>
<p>Verbal intervention might increase as the pound nears 3.00 marks but analysts said this usually had only a limited impact, especially when trying to work against positive fundamentals like interest rate differentials.</p>
<p>Any hint of a return to the European exchange rate mechanism at a lower central rate might also be used as a weapon to rein in sterling, even though analysts question that such a threat is credible in the near term.</p>
<p>The BOE might find some solace in forecasts that point to the pound being close to a top and predict that it will ease to levels around 2.70 marks later this year.</p>
<p>Average forecasts in Reuters July foreign exchange poll, released on Tuesday, showed sterling easing to around 2.90 marks in three months' time and to 2.84 in six months. The average 12-month forecast was for an exchange rate of around 2.76, some 20 pfennigs less than at present.</p>
<p>Risk reversals on sterling/mark options also point to the possibility that sterling is about to see its best levels. They show no marked preference for sterling calls, which give the holder of the option the right to buy sterling.</p>
<p>&quot;The BOE might just opt to let the pound settle,&quot; said a senior trader at a German bank.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a point when the rate rise speculation has run its course, and when rates in continental Europe start rising again. It's just a question whether they can sit it out.&quot;</p>
<p>Sterling has surged by about 30 percent against the mark since last year, boosted by its comparatively high yield compared to other European economies which remain in the doldrums.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the pound is likely to fall victim to its own success. Slumping exports and the imports sucked in as a result of British consumers' increased purchasing power overseas will eventually feed through into a widening trade deficit and weaken the pound.</p>
