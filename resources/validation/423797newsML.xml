<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin will be out to achieve one overriding policy goal and pass a personal test when he crowns his return to the world stage at a summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Helsinki.</p>
<p>Top of Russia's wish list for the meeting on March 20-21 is a breakthrough in the row over NATO's eastward expansion plans which would open the way to a deal mapping out Moscow's post-Cold War relations with the West.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's personal challenge, whether he acknowledges it or not, is to show he is physically capable of governing Russia and conducting diplomacy at the top after eight months on the political sidelines with health problems.</p>
<p>&quot;The summit is a big test for Yeltsin. He has to prove his fitness and ability to rule,&quot; said Andrei Piontkowski, head of Moscow's independent Centre for Strategic Studies.</p>
<p>&quot;The substance of the talks is also very important, especially on NATO enlargement. Yeltsin is hoping for agreement on NATO and if there is no breakthough, there is the risk of sliding back into a Cold War type of confrontation.&quot;</p>
<p>After a &quot;honeymoon&quot; period following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Moscow's relations with the United States and the West in general have cooled.</p>
<p>The risk of ties icing over completely is often discussed in Russia over the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's plans to take in Moscow's former communist allies in eastern Europe. The first invitations will go out at a NATO summit in Madrid in July.</p>
<p>But signs of progress in talks with NATO and the improvement in the 66-year-old Kremlin leader's appearance at recent meetings have encouraged optimism in Moscow ahead of the first summit since Clinton and Yeltsin were re-elected last year.</p>
<p>&quot;We have agreed to look for a compromise and I think we will find this compromise at the summit,&quot; Yeltsin said last month, despite reiterating that Russia would not drop its opposition to NATO enlargement.</p>
<p>RUSSIA SAYS KREMLIN EXPANSION THREATENS ITS SECURITY</p>
<p>The Kremlin says NATO expansion would threaten Russia's security, open divisions in Europe and leave Yeltsin vulnerable to attack by his nationalist and communist opponents.</p>
<p>Russia wants a legally binding agreement with NATO giving it a say in matters that affect its security and containing commitments by the Western defence alliance not to move its infrastructure eastwards.</p>
<p>NATO wants a more flexible agreement which is binding politically but not legally. Despite the contradictions, alliance officials say some sort of deal could still be clinched before the Madrid summit, even if big differences remain.</p>
<p>The row over expansion is set to dominate the summit and leave little room for two other matters which Russia wants to discuss -- economic ties and disarmament.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many problems on which there is a need to agree but it is hard to predict at the moment whether agreement will be reached at the summit,&quot; Vladimir Lukin, head of the lower house of parliament's foreign affairs committee, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Lukin said Yeltsin was right to stand firm on NATO and would not alter his stance in Helsinki. &quot;The only thing Yeltsin and our leaders in general do correctly is maintain a tough position on NATO expansion,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Russian leaders accept privately that NATO expansion is inevitable. Moscow's aim is to delay enlargement as long as it can, exploit any divisions in NATO's ranks and win as many concessions as possible in return for expansion.</p>
<p>YELTSIN NEEDS TO PROVE HIMSELF</p>
<p>Yeltsin needs to show his critics he has defended Russia's interests. But he sets out from a position of weakness, with economic and political problems piling up in Russia and his political foes demanding his resignation for health reasons.</p>
<p>&quot;The propaganda presents this as a summit of two superpowers but in fact it will be a meeting between the leader of an imperialist power and the leader of one of its dominions,&quot; said hardline communist Viktor Anpilov.</p>
<p>In the tense Soviet-U.S. summits of Cold War days, Moscow sought to present a picture of well-being at home to try to negotiate from a position of strength. This has been absent from preparations for Helsinki.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has in recent weeks criticised his government, parliament, defence minister and chief prosecutor, partly to show he is back at the helm following long absences with heart problems and then pneumonia after his re-election last July.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Igor Rodionov says decay in the armed forces is so great that the reliability of the systems controlling its nuclear missiles is in doubt.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia might soon reach the threshold beyond which its rockets and nuclear systems cannot be controlled,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Other Russian officials have since dismissed Rodionov's comments as part of a campaign for more defence spending, but the impression of chaos and weakness could weaken Moscow's negotiating position.</p>
<p>NO RETURN TO COLD WAR</p>
<p>Despite this, Russian foreign policy experts say the Kremlin expects Clinton to compromise and resist the urge to ignore and isolate Russia.</p>
<p>His good personal rapport with Yeltsin also provides further reason for optimism in Moscow that the two leaders can guide their countries through a difficult period in relations.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is wrong to say our relations with the West are getting strained. The West does not need this and we do not need this,&quot; Dmitry Ryurikov, Yeltsin's top foreign policy adviser, said in a recent television interview.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is not, and will not be, any return to the Cold War. That is already a completely different era.&quot;</p>
