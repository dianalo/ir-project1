<p>David Campese is ready to steal Jonathan Davies' thunder when the unbeaten Australians tackle Wales at Cardiff Arms Park on Sunday.</p>
<p>World record try scorer Campese and recalled fly-half Davies celebrated their 34th birthdays within 72 hours of each other last month.</p>
<p>Australian coach Greg Smith looks likely to follow Welsh counterpart Kevin Bowring by deciding that ability should always come before age.</p>
<p>If, as expected, Campese wins his 101st cap, it will be the first on British soil since 1992 when he scored a try against the same opponents on the same ground as Australia triumphed 23-6.</p>
<p>&quot;Campo was sensational during our victory over Munster on Tuesday and he has made it very difficult for me to leave him out,&quot; said Smith, following a punishing two-hour training session in the Cardiff suburbs on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;This current Australian team is performance-based, and once you start to ignore individual performance levels then you are really creating a standard which is not relevant to the professional game.&quot;</p>
<p>Campese became only the second player to reach 100 caps after French centre Philippe Sella when Australia overpowered Italy in Padova last month.</p>
<p>But so far he has been overlooked on the British leg of Australia's 13-match British tour, kicking his heels in frustration while Tim Horan, Jason Little and Joe Roff shared wing duties against Scotland and Ireland.</p>
<p>However, a three-quarter reshuffle, which may see Little or centre Daniel Herbert left out, should reopen the door for Campese when Smith announces the side on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very happy to be part of the 21-man squad for this game,&quot; said Campese.</p>
<p>&quot;We will just have to wait and see whether I am in the team or not, but it would be great to play in Cardiff again. The Arms Park is a great oval and I've got a lot of friends around this part of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Campese could find himself wearing the unfamiliar No 14 jersey, switching from his traditional left-wing berth, if Thursday's training line-up has any significance.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be unfortunate perhaps missing out on the chance to play opposite Ieuan Evans again, but Greg has got some good ideas which means different players appearing in different positions,&quot; Ca,pese said.</p>
<p>Wales are well down the list of Campese's try-scoring exploits, conceding just three against him as compared to Argentina (nine), New Zealand (eight), Scotland (six) and England (five). His tally currently stands at 64.</p>
