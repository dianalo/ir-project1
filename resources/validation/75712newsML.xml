<title>USA: Lehman posts higher profits but lower revenues.</title>
<headline>Lehman posts higher profits but lower revenues.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-25</dateline>

<p>Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. said Wednesday its profits increased by 8 percent in its fiscal third quarter, although the broker and investment banker failed to expand revenues for the first time in five quarters.</p>
<p>The company said its net income for the three months ended Aug. 31 increased to $77 million, or 60 cents a share, from $71 million, or 52 cents a share, a year ago.</p>
<p>However, Lehman said its net revenues, which represent total revenues less interest expenses, slipped 4 percent to $722 million from $750 million last year. They were also well below the second quarter's $833 million.</p>
<p>Lehman said volatile markets and delayed underwritings were among the key reasons the company failed to extend its streak of quarterly revenue growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Volatile conditions in the debt and equity markets, as well as seasonal softness in several businesses, interrupted the five consecutive quarters of higher revenues we had posted,&quot; Chairman Richard Fuld said in a statement.</p>
<p>Lehman also cited the effects of interest rate movements on customer trading volumes and decisions by issuers to delay scheduled underwritings for the decline.</p>
<p>For the nine months, Lehman said its net income soared by 66 percent to $289 million, or $2.28 a share, from $174 million, or $1.27 a share, the year earlier. Net revenues for the three quarters expanded by 9 percent to $2.4 billion from $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>Lehman said in the third quarter its revenues from principal transactions rose to $303 million from $245 million while investment banking revenues fell to $237 million from $251 million.</p>
<p>Commissions revenues fell to $77 million from $116 million while interest and dividend revenues rose to $2.96 billion from $2.83 billion.</p>
<p>However, interest expenses for the quarter rose to $2.86 billion from $2.70 billion, more than offsetting the increase in interest and dividend related revenues.</p>
<p>Other revenues fell to $4 million from $11 million.</p>
<p>Below the revenue line, the picture was somewhat better, with Lehman's return on common equity rising to 9.0 percent from 8.5 percent a year ago. Still, that was well short of the 13.4 percent figure posted in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Lehman's pre-tax margin for the quarter was 16.0 percent, down from the second quarter's 20.2 percent level but up from 14.5 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;While quarterly revenue was off for a number of market-related and seasonal reasons, it is important to note that our discipline around expenses remained strong,&quot; Fuld said.</p>
<p>Total non-interest expenses for the quarter fell to $606 million from $641 million a year ago, a key reason the company was able to improve quarterly net, the company said.</p>
<p>Lehman's stock gained 37.5 cents to $23.375 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
