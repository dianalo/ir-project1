<title>USA: AIG TO PURSUE GOLDEN EAGLE CHALLENGE.</title>
<headline>AIG TO PURSUE GOLDEN EAGLE CHALLENGE.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>American International Group Inc said Monday that it would continue to pursue its challenge to the Golden Eagle Insurance Co rehabilitation proceedings despite an investigation by a California agency into its business practices in that state.</p>
<p>The California Department of Insurance said last week it was launching the investigation because &quot;concerns have mounted regarding AIG's conduct following its losing bid in the Golden Eagle insolvency proceedings.&quot;</p>
<p>The company billed the investigation as retaliation for its objections to the Golden Eagle rehabilitation plan.</p>
<p>&quot;The AIG companies have competed for business and exercised our rights to oppose a governmental decision that we believe is wrong,&quot; AIG Vice President and General Counsel Florence Davis said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;In June, the Department of Insurance twice attempted to stifle us in court, and it lost both times. Now it is threatening us with business conduct proceedings, which, of course, the department controls,&quot; Davis added. &quot;But the law is clear: The department cannot protect one competitor at the expense of another and it cannot trample on free speech and competition.&quot;</p>
<p>Golden Eagle was seized by the agency in January after investigators allegedly found evidence that the company had manipulated its financial records.</p>
<p>AIG had been expected to take over the company. But on May 30, Liberty Mutual Group beat out AIG in a court-supervised auction to acquire Golden Eagle.</p>
