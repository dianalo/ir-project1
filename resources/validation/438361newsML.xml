<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-03-12</dateline>

<p>Hong Kong stocks fell sharply at the start of trading on Wednesday morning, then recovered slightly to trend weak due to a lack of buying incentives and interest rates worries, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Institutions are already pretty overweighted in Hong Kong and it is difficult to see where significant new funds are coming from,&quot; said Julian Ings Chambers, associate director at BZW Securities.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index was trading 71 points lower at 13,181 on robust turnover of HK$1.96 billion. The index dropped to a low of 13,119.08 at the open.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a growing consensus that rates could rise in March,&quot; said Ings-Chambers, referring to the outlook for U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>Hang Seng Index futures market dipped cautiously at the open, with the March contract falling to a low of 13,055 before recovering.</p>
<p>Uncertainty over the interest rate picture accounted for the choppy performance of U.S. markets, analysts said. The U.S. 30-year long bond closed 13/32 lower to yield 6.85 percent</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing to push this market up,&quot; said Angus Shillington in institutional sales at Asia Equity.</p>
<p>The property sector led the market down, followed by utilities.</p>
<p>Hardest hit were the residential property developers. Cheung Kong was sold off HK$1.50 to trade at HK$72.00 and Henderson Land dropped HK$1.25 to HK$66.25.</p>
<p>New World Development slipped HK$1.00 to HK$43.90.</p>
<p>Hongkong Electric lost HK$0.10 to HK$26.80. The company will lead off the reporting season for the Cheung Kong group on Thursday.</p>
<p>China Light slipped HK$0.40 to HK$35.30 but on thin turnover of only HK$20.6 million.</p>
<p>Red chip CITIC Pacific shed HK$0.80 to HK$38.70 on turnover HK$95.85 million.</p>
<p>Cathay Pacific, which will report 1996 earning later on Wednesday, was trading unchanged at HK$11.95</p>
<p>Shenzhen Expressway which made its debut on Wednesday was the most actively traded stock.</p>
<p>The share,offered at HK$2.20, rose to a high of HK$3.375, then eased to HK$3.05 on heavy turnover of HK$670 million.</p>
