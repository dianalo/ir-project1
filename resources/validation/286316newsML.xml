<p>While the Rhine remained navigable from Rotterdam to Basle, the big freeze hit its tributaries and nearby canals, hampering barge movements throughout Benelux and Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;It's getting steadily worse and worse,&quot; one barge operator said.</p>
<p>Conditions were severest in Germany where most Rhine tributaries are either closed or partially blocked due to ice cover or frozen locks. Temperatures in some parts of the country have dropped to below -20 Celsius.</p>
<p>&quot;The Mosel is closed and there are many difficulties on the Main,&quot; said one German barge operator.</p>
<p>Another said one of his barges was locked in at Duisburg and was awaiting ice breakers to free it.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, where temperatures have dipped to as low as -15 Celsius, most canals and tributaries in central and southern parts are officially open.</p>
<p>The Dutch water inspectors RIZA said there were no fresh problems on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Rhine is clear now,&quot; a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Further north, he said, ice cover was hampering traffic on the IJsselmeer, the Dutch inland sea.</p>
<p>However, barge operators said owners were becoming increasingly cautious about risking their barges outside Rotterdam on many waterways officially deemed clear.</p>
<p>&quot;Theoretically, it's possible to reach Antwerp or Flushing (from Rotterdam), but the risk is too high that we break our ships,&quot; said one operator.</p>
<p>The Rotterdam-Amsterdam route is freer, but, even there, operators said there it was dangerous for empty barges.</p>
<p>When empty, the barges sit higher in the water and risk damaging or losing their propellers to the ice cap.</p>
<p>&quot;We're really only happy loading in Rotterdam,&quot; said one operator.</p>
<p>Last year's February freeze led to convoys of barges behind ice breakers to ports such as Amsterdam. There has been no repeat this New Year, but operators said that if the harsh weather continues, the convoys may have to restart.</p>
<p>The Rhine is the main artery into western and southern Germany and Switzerland for imported oil products and demand for the main imported product, heating oil, has risen sharply as Europe sits in the grip of a week-long freeze.</p>
<p>On Friday, an independent U.S. weather forecaster said there would be no let-up in the chill until early next week at the earliest.</p>
<p>&quot;A severe cold wave continues as the predominant wind flow is from the east,&quot; said Weather Services Corp (WSC), predicting below normal temperatures in northwest Europe for the next 10 days.</p>
<p>&quot;Energy demand has been and will continue to be well above normal,&quot; it said.</p>
