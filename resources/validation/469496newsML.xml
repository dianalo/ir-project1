<p>New York Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato would lose his seat if former Gov. Mario Cuomo or former Representative Geraldine Ferraro challenged him in the November election, a new poll showed Wednesday.</p>
<p>The poll by the Marist Institute showed 33 percent of registered voters planned to vote for D'Amato, 34 percent planned to vote against him and 19 percent said it depends who the candidates are.</p>
<p>Cuomo would defeat D'Amato by 55 percent to 37 percent, the poll showed. The former Democratic governor has not publicly said if he is considering a Senate race.</p>
<p>Ferraro, the first woman to run for vice president on a major party ticket, would defeat D'Amato 47 percent to 43 percent, the poll said.</p>
<p>Ferraro, who lost the 1992 Democratic Senate primary to challenge D'Amato, is now a moderator on CNN's political show &quot;Crossfire.&quot; She has indicated that she is weighing a return to politics. Walter Mondale, the presidential candidate, and Ferraro headed the Democratic ticket in 1984.</p>
<p>The poll showed D'Amato's approval rating at 36 percent, with 59 percent rating him only fair or poor. Those results are statistically unchanged from November, Marist said.</p>
<p>Other polls have shown his approval ratings improving since last year.</p>
<p>Last year, D'Amato was active in pursuing the Whitewater investigation against the Clintons and was a heavy supporter of former Sen. Bob Dole's unsuccessful presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Faced with negative approval ratings, political observers said he has since changed tactics and started promoting such causes as breast cancer research and efforts to locate money in Swiss banks that belonged to Holocaust victims.</p>
<p>The Marist poll also showed 62 percent of respondents felt D'Amato is &quot;too closely tied to special interests.&quot;</p>
<p>It showed D'Amato also losing to potential challenger New York City Public Advocate Mark Green but defeating Democratic Representative Nita Lowey. Another survey this month showed D'Amato trailing all his potential Democratic challengers.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted by telephone March 17-19 among 603 registered voters. The margin of error was plus or minus 4 percent.</p>
