<p>A single European currency will gradually rival the dollar on global markets, transforming the world's monetary system into a multi-polar regime, the European Commission said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging report on the international dimension of economic and monetary union (EMU), the EU's executive painted an upbeat but cautious assessment of how the single currency, the euro, would fare on the world stage.</p>
<p>&quot;The development of the euro into a major international currency will be gradual, but relatively important in those countries which have close links with the EMU-participating countries,&quot; the Commission said in a report.</p>
<p>Assisting its rise to global currency status would be trade relations with countries immediately outside monetary union. In effect, the euro would benefit as an anchor currency for Europe and neigbouring regions.</p>
<p>&quot;The countries of central and eastern Europe which already tie their currencies to the mark will be linked to the euro ipso facto,&quot; the study said, adding that such links could extend to Mediterranean and African countries.</p>
<p>Another factor in the euro's favour is the EU's relative weight in global trade. In 1996 the EU's share of gross domestic product in the OECD amounted to 38.3 percent, as against 32.5 percent for the United States and 20.5 percent for Japan.</p>
<p>Although a large percentage of world trade is currently priced in dollars, this could change once the euro is introduced.</p>
<p>The so-called working document also touched on several important and controversial issues, including how countries within EMU would be represented in international settings.</p>
<p>On this point, there was no immediate answer.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that the EU must establish, where relevant, a common position for international discussion,&quot; the report said, adding that responsibility for such matters would rest with finance ministers, a European Central Bank and the Commission.</p>
<p>But just who would represent the euro area within gatherings such as the Group of Seven industrialised nations was left unspecified.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have to see how we will organise representation at the international level,&quot; EU commissioner Yves Thibault de Silguy told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to have a single expression of Europe's positions. It is a real problem.&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The study played down speculation that the dollar would suffer due to an excessive buildup of U.S. currency reserves by central banks inside EMU.</p>
<p>The creation of a European Central Bank (ECB) is widely expected to result in a surplus of dollar reserves among central banks participating in the euro -- dubbed the dollar overhang.</p>
<p>One of the major worries is that the unwanted dollars might be quickly sold on global currency markets, leading to a sharp fall in the U.S. currency's value. The Commission's study minimised the likelihood of such a scenario.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the absolute value of the amounts involved may indeed be substantial, they are not significant in view of the turnover in financial markets,&quot; the study said.</p>
<p>Moreover, central banks will be fully aware of the potential impact on exchange rates of their transactions, therefore any attempts to reduce the dollar overhang will likely be gradual.</p>
<p>The study was also inconclusive on the readjustment of private portfolios towards the euro.</p>
<p>&quot;Traders within the euro area that previously kept different European currencies to diversify their risk may be faced with a surplus for euros for transaction purposes,&quot; the study said.</p>
<p>Alternatively, those who were not previously invested in European currencies might want to readjust their portfolios to include the euro.</p>
<p>Perhaps more controversial was the view that monetary policy under the euro might have to be accomodative because of relatively tight governments' budget policies and high unemployment.</p>
