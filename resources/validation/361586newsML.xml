<p>Renewed sterling strength has pulled the Irish pound up further against the German mark, causing new concern over the Irish unit's strength within the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) grid, economists said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, the punt has been close to the top of the ERM grid for some time, but sterling is now pushing it higher, and we are currently over 11 percent above the weakest currency in the grid, the French franc,&quot; Riada analyst Padraic Garvey said.</p>
<p>The Irish pound's central rate against the French franc is 8.086, but the Irish currency is allowed to fluctuate 15 percent either way from that, which gives it a maximum level of 9.3, Garvey said. Garvey said the punt was currently just below 9.0.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, the currency remains under pressure on the upside against other European currencies and on the downside against sterling, and there is not a lot we can do about it,&quot; Bank of Ireland group Treasury economist Jim Power said.</p>
<p>Power said the Irish unit's moves prove again it is hostage to sterling's vagaries. &quot;It has all sorts of implications for Ireland in a post-EMU (economic and monetary union) world without sterling,&quot; he warned.</p>
<p>Garvey said if the Irish currency continues to rise within the grid, the central bank will have to sell punts and buy French francs and the Bank of France would have to buy francs and sell punts to prevent a breach of the 15-percent ERM limit.</p>
<p>&quot;The dilemma for Ireland is that if the central bank is forced to sell punts, that would act to boost liquidity on the interebank market because it would be building up foreign exchange reserves,&quot; Garvey said. &quot;So, the catch-22 is that there would be pressure for interbank rates to fall, coming from the foreign exchange market.&quot;</p>
<p>Sterling's recent strength has also resulted in a sharp drop in the sterling/Irish exchange rate.</p>
<p>&quot;The punt has fallen by six percent versus sterling in four months,&quot; Garvey said. &quot;The question is where will that leave Irish inflation, not in 1997 but in 1998.&quot;</p>
<p>By 1159 GMT, the Irish pound was 2.6545 against the mark and had dropped to 0.9799 against sterling.</p>
<p>&quot;If sterling continues to move ahead by another two pfennigs, we will see the stg/Irish cross move down to below 97 pence,&quot; a foreign exchange dealer said.</p>
<p>Ireland's basic problem is that it is in the throes of an economic boom, which was further stimulated by an expansionary budget unveiled by the government last month, economists said.</p>
<p>This, combined with sterling strength, was causing a serious dilemma for Ireland's central bank in its attempts to maintain a stable and viable currency in the run up to EMU.</p>
<p>Economic strength was expected to be further highlighted this afternoon when the central bank releases monthly credit statistics for December.</p>
<p>Economists' forecasts range from 15- to 17-percent credit growth year-on-year from 16.4 percent the previous month.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd say there must be nervousness in the (central) bank about the inflation profile over the next few years. Lets face it, the scope for inflation to rise here is not very high,&quot; Power said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am forecasting inflation at a 2.4-percent average this year, which will barely get us in below the Maastricht ceiling. And the problem for the central bank is that there is not a lot they can do about it.&quot;</p>
