<p>The Swedish government is set to hand down an expansionary budget on Tuesday, announcing 20 billion crowns in extra spending to reverse the effects of recent austerity measures.</p>
<p>The budget, which is always leaked to the press in advance of its publication, is due to be issued at 1100 GMT. It was published by the Swedish national news agency TT.</p>
<p>Combatting unemployment is the lynchpin of the supplementary budget proposal, which also appears aimed at restoring the flagging political fortunes of Prime Minister Goran Persson ahead of a general election next year.</p>
<p>With Persson struggling to meet a promise to halve unemployment by the year 2000, his minority Social Democrat government is to plough over 20 billion crowns into ways to boost employment and education by the end of 1998.</p>
<p>The Social Democrats, who are sinking in the opinion polls, hope these measures will drive unemployment down to 4.5 percent in 2000 from 7.9 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Persson has pledged to halve unemployment to 4.0 percent by 2000 from 1996 levels of around 8.0 percent -- but his promise is starting to lack credibility with unemployment running at 8.4 percent in March.</p>
<p>The budget painted a steady growth path for Sweden over the coming two years.</p>
<p>The government said in the leaked budget that 4.0 billion crowns would be granted to local authorities this year to boost spending on healthcare and schools. That amount would be doubled in 1998.</p>
<p>In addition, the government would reveal in the budget a five point programme of labour market measures, further education, sustainable growth, improving business confidence and healthcare that will cost 16.3 billion crowns in 1998, TT said.</p>
<p>The government said the increased spending would be financed by a projected budget surplus of 13.9 billion in 1998.</p>
<p>Sweden's gross domestic product (GDP), which grew at a modest 1.1 percent in 1996, was expected to pick up speed to grow at 2.3 percent in 1997 and 2.5 percent in 1998.</p>
<p>Despite the new spending plans the government said it would achieve its goal of balancing the books by 1998.</p>
<p>The budget deficit for 1997 was estimated at 2.1 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>The cost of the government's five-point programme would grow to 21 billion crowns in 1999 and 23.3 billion crowns in 2000, sponsored by the country's budget surplus, the government said.  </p>
<p>The minority Social Democratic government also said it saw a state borrowing need of 26 billion crowns in 1997 and of nine billion crowns in 1998, compared to a 1996 central government borrowing of 21.0 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The government said it expected inflation and gross domestic product (GDP) to pick up, albeit modestly, downgrading most of its September 1996 forecasts.</p>
<p>It saw year-on-year consumer prices rising 1.8 percent in 1997 and 1.5 percent in 1998, compared to a price fall of 0.2 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Thereby the government reduced its September forecast of a 2.2 percent rise for both this year and next year.</p>
<p>GDP was expected to rise 2.3 percent in 1997 and 2.5 percent in 1998, the government said, leaving the forecast for next year unchanged and downgrading its 1998 estimate from 2.6 percent.</p>
