<headline>Two Brent cargoes trade - October barrels cleared.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Following two physical Brent deals on Tuesday October barrels of the grade were sold out, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like it (October Brent) is all gone. If this ULCC does go to the U.S. the market looks firmer,&quot; one commented.</p>
<p>The trader expected to take the ULCC to the U.S. now owns five end October maximum size Brent cargoes.</p>
<p>&quot;There may have to be some swapping around to get the right cargoes to fit on the vessel, but basically it is sorted out and November is looking stronger already,&quot; another commented.  </p>
<p>November Brent on the IPE lost some of Monday's gains to trade at 1630 GMT down 14 cents at $24.72 a barrel.</p>
<p>As November North Sea barrels started to move levels were seen steady to firmer - a Gullfaks Nov 1-3 moved at dated Brent +39 cents and unconfirmed talk of a first decade November Statfjord traded at dated Brent +40-43 cents was thought low by some prospective buyers.</p>
<p>Other wet trade included a Troll Nov 9-11 at dated +60 cents, a Nov 6-10 Draugen at dated +50 cents.</p>
<p>Urals in the North was heard well balanced with loadings still delayed by 1-2 days.  </p>
<p>Brent Dec/Jan traded three times between +67-70 cents while further forward a Dec/Mar was heard at $2.18.</p>
<p>On the CFD market the October 21-25 was the most actively traded week and gained ground later to discussion around Dec +22/26 cents after earlier trading at Dec +21 cents.</p>
