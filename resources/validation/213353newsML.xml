<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures ended higher across the board Monday in a sluggish pre-holiday session, driven by relatively firm cash prices though few had strong convictions about market direction, sources said. January climbed 5.7 cents to close at $3.494 per million British thermal units. February settled 7.6 cents higher at $3.046. Other deferreds ended up by 1.5 to 5.5 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to see Jan selling off with cash firm. With December Hub still at $3.85, why is Jan still at $3.50,&quot; said one East Coast trader, adding the steep backwardation was prompting some to use storage too early.  </p>
<p>While most assumed operators would be cautious about early withdrawals after steady cold last winter drained stocks and spiked prices, the East Coast trader said some operators may be cashing in on the backwardated market, possibly setting the stage for a late-season rally.</p>
<p>NYMEX will be closed Thursday and Friday for the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday.</p>
<p>Chartists still pegged Jan support in the mid-$3.20s and then at $3.04. Resistance was seen at the $3.68 contract high.</p>
<p>Cash sources said November Gulf Coast gas firmed several cents Monday to about the $3.70 area, with December on the same pipes notionally steady in the $3.80s. Cold weather drove November Midcon prices up almost 20 cents to the $3.80s. December Midcon notionally firmed 15 cents to the $3.80s. December New York city gate gas notionally was softer in the $4.80s to $4.90s.</p>
<p>The 12-month Henry Hub strip rose 4.8 cents to $2.449. NYMEX said 22,756 Hub contracts traded, down from Friday's revised tally of 40,790.</p>
<p>NYMEX December Alberta natgas expired four cents lower at $1.76, while deferred contracts were untraded. NYMEX said 50 Alberta contracts traded versus 30 on Friday.</p>
<p>NYMEX December Permian natgas expired 0.1 cent higher at $3.641 after trading earlier at a new benchmark of $3.685. Deferreds were untraded. NYMEX said 73 Permian lots changed hands compared to five on Friday.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, January finished up seven cents at a new high of $3.27, while forward months ended three to eight cents higher. The East/West spread narrowed by 1.3 cents to 22.4 cents (NYMEX premium). KCBT said 349 contracts traded, down from Friday's total of 796.</p>
