<headline>Euro bourses fall, hit by weak Wall St.</headline>

<p>European stocks fell from record levels in early trade on Thursday, dragged down by a sharp overnight sell-off on Wall Street.</p>
<p>On currency markets, the dollar was strong in morning transactions, rising against the mark as new figures showed Germany's unemployment rose to post-World War Two record levels in January.</p>
<p>In London, Europe' biggest bourse, shares slipped 0.27 percent after the FTSE 100 index closed at a record of 4,281.5 on Wednesday on hopes that low interest rates would be sustained.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that every time we get close to 4,300 the sellers come in,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The Dow ended 86 points lower on Wednesday after being up five points as London markets closed. Technology stocks led the sell-off and Nasdaq posted its tenth largest one-day drop.</p>
<p>The Dow's fall occurred despite news that the U.S. central bank's policy-making body had left interest rates unchanged at its two-day meeting that ended on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Paris, French shares opened sharply lower on the back of the overnight fall on Wall Street. Trading was nervous ahead of important U.S. unemployment data due on Friday.</p>
<p>Cie Gnrale des Eaux and Havas were suspended pending a statement. The two companies will hold a joint news conference starting at 1630 GMT where they are expected to announce a deal concerning their stakes in satellite broadcaster Canal Plus .</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down nearly 0.5 percent at mid-morning after closing at a record 2,541.25 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, stocks slipped in and out of the minus column in early trade but perked up slightly as the higher-than-expected jobless figures were seen as keeping interest rates in check.</p>
<p>On the foreign exchange front, the dollar strengthened as German government figures showed unemployment surged by over a half a million in January to a new post-war record of 4.66 million.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate, which is based on unadjusted data, rose to 12.2 percent, compared with 10.8 percent in December.</p>
<p>&quot;The report is certainly going to keep dollar/mark well bid. Going into the G7, it would look a bit odd if the current weakness of the numbers in Germany and Japan made the G7 able to feel able to do much about the dollar's rise,&quot; said Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW in London.</p>
<p>The dollar was up nearly half a pfennig by mid-morning and was also stronger against the yen.</p>
<p>The jobless data set the tone for a day of strong trading for the dollar, with analysts seeing little reason to sell it off except some profit-taking and perhaps a little wariness ahead of the Group of Seven (G7) meeting in Berlin this weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;Weak unemployment figures...would reinforce speculation of monetary easing in Germany, and that should give the dollar a bit of a bid against the mark,&quot; said Nigel Richardson, international economist at Yamaichi International.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1050 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.6505 marks and 123.68 yen compared with 1.6479 marks and 123.54 yen in late European trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1030 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index was 18.0 points down at 4263.5.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index was 2.59 higher at 3100.59.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 was down 11.75 at 2,529.5.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was unchanged at the fix at $342.95 an ounce.</p>
