<title>BRAZIL: Brazil tightens credit to cut consumer spending.</title>

<p>Central Bank President Gustavo Loyola on Friday said Brazil would increase taxes on credit transactions by individuals to slow consumer spending.</p>
<p>Although the tax increase to 15 percent from six percent would apply to all goods, the measure was specifically aimed at cutting purchases of automobiles and durable goods, which have been pressuring Brazil's trade accounts, Loyola said at a news conference.  </p>
<p>The credit curbs, which were widely expected by the market, would apply to bank loans, credit card operations, auto financing and all types of consumer lending, officials said.</p>
<p>Economic Policy Minister Jose Roberto Mendonca de Barros, who spoke along with Loyola, said the measures were not aimed at slowing the economy, but balancing growth.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is a moderate change. It is not very drastic and it aims at evening out economic growth so that there is some equilibrium between consumption and other sectors like exports, manufacturing and construction,&quot; Mendonca de Barros said.</p>
<p>The new credit curbs will be published in a decree on Monday, officials said.</p>
<p>The curbs were expected by economists who have said the government would have to do something to slow Brazil's rising import growth, which has resulted in record annual and monthly trade deficits over the past two years.  </p>
<p>Autos and durable goods make up a significant share of imports and are being targeted by the new measures, Mendonca de Barros said.  </p>
<p>In February and March, car sales rose 20 percent over last year, while durable goods sales, although steadying in recent months, have also been extremely high, he said.</p>
