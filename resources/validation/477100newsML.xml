<p>Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma on Monday gave Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda a week to win parliament's vote of confidence, a day after the Congress party withdrew vital support for his government.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda has said he would face parliament and was not planning to resign after the Congress party abandoned the United Front alliance on Sunday, citing rising lawlessness, a drifting economy and a growing communal menace.</p>
<p>&quot;The President has requested the prime minister to seek a vote of confidence in the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) by Monday, 7th April 1997,&quot; a one-line presidential communique said.</p>
<p>The Congress, India's oldest party and runner-up in last year's national polls, asked Deve Gowda to resign and said his ruling coalition should support a new Congress-led government.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question of my resignation or suggesting dissolution of the (lower) house,&quot; the Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted Deve Gowda as telling reporters in the capital. &quot;The trial of strength will be held on the floor of the house.&quot;</p>
<p>The shock move by the Congress party sent stock prices into a tailspin and overshadowed Monday's conclusion of crucial talks between India and Pakistan. The talks ended with an agreement to meet again in the Pakistan capital Islamabad.</p>
<p>Negotations between the two neighbours had suffered a three-year impasse before resuming last Friday in New Delhi. Sharma's directive ended speculation whether parliament would meet on April 21, as scheduled, to resume discussion on the budget for fiscal 1997/98 (April-March) or meet earlier to allow the prime minister to face the trust vote.</p>
<p>&quot;Deve Gowda should gracefully resign and the United Front should support a Congress-led government to help fight the communal forces,&quot; Congress spokesman Vithal Gadgil told a news conference on Monday.</p>
<p>Asked how Congress expected to form a government backed by the coalition it sought to topple, Gadgil said: &quot;In politics, certain things are not stated publicly.&quot;</p>
<p>Gadgil said Congress had sent a letter to Sharma &quot;to stake our claim to form the government&quot;.</p>
<p>Asked if he was confident he could prove his majority in the Lok Sabha, Deve Gowda said: &quot;We will take care of it.&quot;</p>
<p>The PTI news agency quoted the prime minister as saying the 15 parties in his United Front alliance were &quot;standing together like a rock&quot; and would decide the future course of action.</p>
<p>&quot;I will abide by the decisions of the Steering Committee which is the highest policy-making body of the (United) Front,&quot; PTI quoted Deve Gowda as saying.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee began its meeting at 3:30 p.m. (1000 GMT) on Monday.</p>
<p>Indian shares plunged more than eight percent in nervous trading on Monday as investors digested news of the Congress withdrawal.</p>
<p>Bombay's benchmark stocks index crashed 299.63 points, or 8.2 percent, to a provisional close of 3,363.90.</p>
<p>Stock brokers in Bombay, India's financial centre, said it was unclear how Congress, which has only 140 deputies in the 545-seat Lok Sabha could form a government.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda's alliance, which groups free-traders, communists and centrists and controls some 178 deputies in the lower house, was formed in June 1996 after inconclusive national elections.</p>
<p>An opinion poll last month predicted major gains for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which emerged in 1996 as the single biggest group in the Lok Sabha, against both the United Front and the Congress if mid-term polls were held soon.</p>
