<title>USA: Jury decides Pioneer Oil to pay Unocal.</title>
<headline>Jury decides Pioneer Oil to pay Unocal.</headline>
<dateline>SALT LAKE CITY 1997-01-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Pioneer Oil and Gas said Wednesday a jury had decided that it must pay Unocal Corp $563,158 in litigation involving an oilfield in the Santa Maria Valley in California.  </p>
<p>Pioneer said it planned to appeal the decision, which found that Pioneer was liable to Unocal for breach of contract, for open account and for goods supplied and services rendered.</p>
<p>The jury also found that Unocal was liable to Pioneer for breach of contract, for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for breach of fiduciary duty, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel the damages rendered by the jury were inappropriate,&quot; Pioneer said. &quot;Although Unocal's initial claim of $3,000,000 was substantially mitigated through the trial process, we believe that compelling evidence for underpricing of crude oil and fraudulent billing of fuel gas were not properly understood by the jury.&quot;</p>
<p>Pioneer said it was suing Mobil Oil Corp for alleged fraud in selling it the property in 1987 for $12,360 without disclosing the existence of buried oil sumps for which the cleanup costs are substantial.</p>
<p>&quot;Initially we tried to include Mobil in the Unocal lawsuit but it was ruled by the judge that two separate trials must take place,&quot; it said.</p>
