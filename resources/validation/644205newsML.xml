<title>ITALY: FORECAST - Italy seen with June state sector surplus.</title>
<headline>FORECAST - Italy seen with June state sector surplus.</headline>
<dateline>MILAN 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Italy is expected to post a state sector surplus of nearly 30 trillion lire for June, up on a surplus of 25.5 trillion in June 1996, analysts polled by Reuters said.</p>
<p>The net inflow this month, underpinned by a healthy trend in fiscal and extraordinary revenue, should guarantee that Italy's cumulative borrowing requirement for the first half will be close to a Treasury target of 25 trillion lire.</p>
<p>The analysts said that after higher than expected PSBR in April and May, a good figure in June is essential to put state accounts back on track for Italy to reach the three percent budget deficit/GDP goal to join the single European currency at its start in January 1999.</p>
<p>The month of June traditionally shows a surplus.</p>
<p>Italy's borrowing requirement was some 13 trillion lire in May, taking the cumulative total for the first five months of this year to around 55 trillion lire.</p>
<p>Analysts said there were still lingering doubts over whether Italy would reach the 3.0 percent Maastricht target by the end of this year although the scenario looked more possible now than it had in recent months.</p>
<p>Their consensus was for a 1997 net debt figure of 63.7 trillion lire, some five trillion above Treasury forecasts, and to plug this overshoot the analysts were already looking at the possibility of the government having to implement a further corrective mini-budget towards the end of the year.</p>
<p>However, there was some cause to be optimistic for the future. &quot;Strict control of drawings on treasury accounts by ministries and local authorities is limiting expenditure,&quot; said Andrea Marchetti of Credito Italiano.</p>
<p>&quot;In the first half of this year the Treasury has made a considerable effort and on the current expenditure side is by now scraping the barrel,&quot; said Giuliano Gasparini of research institute Prometeia.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way to further reduce spending is to tackle the thorny problem of structural expenditure, leaving aside the question of debt service charges which could fall further if the Bank of Italy cut its discount rate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts forecast on average a June surplus of 29.3 trillion lire, giving a cumulative first half deficit of 25.7 trillion lire.</p>
<p>In their estimates, they saw the traditional June surplus near the top end of expectations due to increased revenue from corporate tax, the government's one-off &quot;Eurotax&quot; on income, and a higher level of central bank inflows.</p>
<p>Following are analysts' forecasts (in trillion lire):</p>

<p>GOVT FORECAST	     --		  25.0	     58.8 *</p>
<p>================================================================</p>
<p>* NOTE - The figure is the difference between a 74.3 trillion lire Public Administration net deficit forecast in the March 1997 report on state accounts and the 15.5 trillion lire of deficit-cutting measures contained in the recent mini-budget.</p>
