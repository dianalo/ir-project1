<p>A consortium of Spain's Repsol oil firm and Britain's Enterprise Oil Plc signed a deal with Kazakhstan on Wednesday to explore its north-western Baiganinsk oil field, Repsol said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;On July 9, 1997, a consortium comprised of Spanish company Repsol...and British company Enterprise Oil...signed a tax and royalty agreement for the exploration and production of oil in the Baiganinsk contract area with the Republic of Kazakhstan,&quot; said the statement.</p>
<p>Willy Hernandez, Repsol Exploracion Kazakhstan S.A. General Manager, told a news briefing prior to the signing at the former Soviet republic's energy and natural resources ministry that the consortium would invest $25 million in the first six year.</p>
<p>He said Repsol would invest 60 percent of the sum and Enterprise Oil the remaining 40 percent, in line with their shares in the consortium.</p>
<p>The contract area of some 10,000 square km in Kazakhstan's north-western Aktyubinsk region, which the consortium was awarded by the Kazakh government after a tender in 1993, &quot;has a high potential&quot;, said Hernandez but gave no further detail.</p>
<p>But asked on the consortium's plans if oil is found in the region, he said: &quot;We are interested not only in exploration but production.&quot; He said exploration works would start in September.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan, a vast steppeland Central Asian state five times the size of France and with a population of just 16.7 million people, has huge reserves of oil, and foreign investors have muscled their way into its energy sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We wish to partake in the potential of Kazakhstan,&quot; Douglas Colkin, enterprise Oil Europe Area Manager, told the news briefing. &quot;It gives us an entry point to Kazakhstan, from which we hope to build,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Foreigners have so far invested over $2 billion in Kazakhstan's oil and gas sector out of a total of over $3.5 billion of direct investment in the country's economy.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan plans to become the world's sixth oil producer with 170 million tonnes a year by 2010, boosting output from some 27 million tonnes this year.</p>
