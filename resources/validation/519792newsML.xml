<headline>SOCCER-ITALY SERIE A WEEKEND MATCHES.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-04-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Matches scheduled for this weekend in the Italian Serie A (kick-off times GMT, league positions in parentheses):</p>
<p>Bologna (5) v Juventus (1), Saturday 14.00</p>
<p>One week after their surprise upset in a 3-0 home defeat by Udinese, league leaders Juventus could have done without an away game against in-form Bologna. Juventus will be at full strength with Frenchman Didier Deschamps returning to midfield alongside compatriot Zinedine Zidane, Yugoslav Vladimir Jugovic and Angelo Di Livio and with Croat Alen Boksic and Christian Vieri in attack. Bologna are without Russian striker Igor Kolyvanov but welcome back Swedish striker Kennet Andersson.</p>
<p>Cagliari (15) v Internazionale (3), Saturday 14.00</p>
<p>Even if they have a UEFA Cup semifinal, second leg tie against French side Monaco on Tuesday, into which they take a 3-1 lead, Inter will not be taking things easy against relegation battlers Cagliari. That 3-0 Juventus defeat by Udinese last week has thrown open the fight for the runners-up spot and a Champions League place. Chilean Ivan Zamorano and Maurizio Ganz, backed by Frenchman Youri Djorkaeff, lead the Inter attack while Sandro Tovalieri and Uruguyan Dario Silva are up front for Cagliari.</p>
<p>Fiorentina (8) v AS Roma (10), Saturday 14.00</p>
<p>Struggling Roma will hope that Fiorentina get distracted by thoughts of next Thursday's Cup Winners' Cup semifinal return leg against Spanish side Barcelona, a game that begins on a 1-1 scoreline. Fiorentina's Argentine ace Gabriel Batistuta plays, despite breaking a bone in his right hand in a mid-week accident in his home. Russian winger Andreij Kanchelskis and Francesco Baiano partner Batistuta while Roma rely on Swede Jonas Thern in midfield with Marco Delvecchio and Abel Balbo in attack.</p>
<p>Lazio (6) v Reggiana (18), Sunday 14.00</p>
<p>Lazio should pick up important points against bottom of the table Reggiana. Pierluigi Casiraghi returns to the Lazio bench but captain Giuseppe Signori and Igor Protti will lead the attack. Reggiana's seemingly hopeless cause will be led as usual by Russian striker Igor Simutenkov.</p>
<p>AC Milan (12) v Piacenza (14), Sunday 14.00</p>
<p>Throughout the week, Milan players have been saying that this is a game between equals. Given Milan's crisis-ridden season, the players have a point even if Milan are actually eight points clear of Piacenza. Roberto Baggio, one of the few bright lights in last week's 3-1 derby defeat by Inter, may again be dropped in favour of Marco Simone and George Weah in attack while Frenchman Marcel Desailly is suspended. Piacenza rely on Pasquale Luiso and Gianpietro Piovani in attack.</p>
<p>Napoli (13) v Atalanta (11), Sunday 18.30</p>
<p>A draw could be on the cards here between two sides still too close to the relegation zone for comfort. Nicola Caccia and Alfredo Aglietti lead the Napoli attack while 20-year-old Uruguyan Federico Magallanes makes only his ninth outing of the season as replacement for the suspended Gigi Lentini.</p>
<p>Parma (2) v Udinese (7), Sunday 14.00</p>
<p>Do or die time for Parma if their title challenge is to prove serious. Striker Enrico Chiesa and Croat midfielder Mario Stanic are both out through injury, leaving Alessandro Melli to step in alongside Argentine Hernan Crespo in attack, with Pietro Strada moving into midfield. Udinese were the giant killers last week with a 3-0 away win against leaders Juventus, and again field impressive attacking duo of German Oliver Bierhoff and Brazilian Amoroso.</p>
<p>Sampdoria (4) v Verona (17), Sunday 14.00</p>
<p>Sampdoria, 1-0 winners against Lazio last week, should pick up more vital points to improve their chances of a place in Europe next season when they meet Verona, another side seemingly destined for relegation. Captain Roberto Mancini and Vicenzo Montella, joint leading goalscorer with Atalanta's Filippo Inzaghi on 18, lead the Sampdoria attack while Filippo Maniero and Nicola Zanini are up front for Verona.</p>
<p>Vicenza (9) v Perugia (16), Sunday 14.00</p>
<p>Perugia have spent the week locked away in a pre-match retreat following their 2-0 defeat by Verona last Sunday. They can only hope that Vicenza's recent loss of form continues. With Roberto Murgita suspended, Giovanni Cornacchini and Uruguyan Marcelo Otero lead the Vicenza attack while Perugia look to Marco Negri and Croat Milan Rapajic up front.</p>
