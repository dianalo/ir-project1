<p>If Mobil Corp and Amoco Corp merged their U.S. downstream assets, the plan would likely spark competition concerns on the refining and marketing sides, merger and antitrust attorneys said Monday.</p>
<p>Mobil said it was talking to &quot;several&quot; companies over a possible deal, but a spokesman would not comment on a London Sunday Telegraph report that said Mobil was &quot;deep in talks&quot; with Amoco to merge their downstream interests.</p>
<p>Lawyers said the focus of antitrust concerns would be on refining capacity and location, pipeline ownership and retail outlets.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly Mobil and Amoco are in each other's market with a vengeance,&quot; said Henry Banta, a partner at Lobel, Novins and Lamont. &quot;All my intuition says that if there is such a thing as an illegal merger, it's that.&quot;</p>
<p>The two companies both have large refineries in Texas and the Illinois-Indiana area. &quot;I think they've got a big problem there,&quot; Banta said.</p>
<p>On the transportation side, attorneys said port access and ownership in major pipelines would be a major issue.  </p>
<p>Both companies own a piece of Colonial Pipeline, the major link between Gulf Coast refineries and the East Coast products market, with Amoco Pipeline Co holding a 14.3 percent interest and Mobil holding an 11.5 percent stake.</p>
<p>In the retail business, attorneys said the companies would likely have to give up some service stations.</p>
<p>&quot;When you're talking about retail competition, you spark the interest of every state attorney general,&quot; said Stephen Axinn of Axinn, Veltrop and Harkrider. &quot;This is something every motorist sees when he gets out on the highway.&quot;</p>
<p>Consumer activist Edwin Rothschild of Citizen Action, who has protested the proposed U.S. downstream merger of Shell Oil Co with Texaco Inc, would likely face trouble in the Washington, DC area.</p>
<p>&quot;It's disturbing. Amoco is the largest seller here in the DC metro area, and Mobil is close to the top,&quot; he said.</p>
