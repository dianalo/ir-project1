<title>ALBANIA: Albanian demonstrators breach police lines.</title>

<p>Some 3,000 Albanians forced their way past police with batons and water cannon on Sunday to hold a protest in Tirana's main Skanderbeg Square, defying government warnings against the demonstration, eyewitnesses said.</p>
<p>The crowd, led by opposition party leaders, burst through police cordons to reach the square, symbolic as the scene of a 1990 uprising that toppled Albania's communist regime, shouting: &quot;The police are with us, the government is a thief&quot;.</p>
<p>The protest was called after a week of minor demonstrations against collapsing pyramid investment schemes in which hundreds of people have lost their life savings.</p>
<p>The crowd grouped in front of the grey, concrete Palace of Culture in Skanderbeg Square, despite police attempts to block streets leading into the square with vans.</p>
<p>The main crowd was led into Skanderbeg Square by Social Democrat leader Skender Gjinushi. Another group accompanied by Socialist Secretary-General Rexhep Mejdani appeared to have been halted.</p>
<p>President Sali Berisha vowed on Saturday to crack down on pyramid investment schemes but warned the opposition against exploiting anger among investors to try to destabilise the ex-communist state.</p>
<p>Skanderbeg Square was the scene of an opposition rally last May called to protest what they said was a general election rigged by the ruling Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Three dubious investment groups have collapsed in the past few weeks in Albania, Europe's poorest country. Infuriated investors clashed with baton-wielding police on Wednesday in a demonstration over the investment projects.</p>
<p>Pyramid schemes boomed in the Balkan nation after the fall of communism in 1990, luring thousands of Albanians into selling homes, land and livestock with promises of big returns on small sums invested.</p>
