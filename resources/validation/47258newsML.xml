<p>Britain's Communications Workers Union (CWU) said it would go ahead with two one-day strikes this month, rejecting an appeal from opposition Labour Party leader Tony Blair for a ballot to be held first.</p>
<p>The CWU has refused to back down even though the head of the mail service said postal workers would forfeit a 100 million pound ($155 million) benefits package if the strikes went ahead on September 20 and 22.</p>
<p>The government has said it would suspend the monopoly the Royal Mail enjoys on letter delivery for another three months in the event of further disruption. The monopoly was lifted for a month in August after a series of stoppages.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not re-ballot,&quot; CWU general secretary Alan Johnson told a news conference at the Trades Union Congress conference.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision yesterday (of the CWU executive) was that we will re-ballot when we have a satisfactory agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>The CWU has rejected a pay and hours proposal from the Royal Mail to rearrange the way the mail is sorted and delivered.</p>
<p>Royal Mail management said its offer of extra pay, plus a cut in hours and extra holidays add up to a 100 million pound package, but it needed the new working arrangements to make it cost-effective.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to operate in the real world...we're seeing competition building up all the time. We can't afford in the business to give something away for nothing,&quot; Royal Mail managing director Richard Dyke told Sky television.</p>
<p>Blair called on the union to reballot its members on the latest pay offer. The union, by law, had to ballot its members before it began the series of one-day strikes. There have been eight stoppages to date.</p>
<p>&quot;If the dispute continues it is right there is a further consultation of members -- that would be the overwhelming view of the public and members of the union,&quot; he told reporters in the northern town of Blackpool.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a reasonable offer put on the table and I am sure it would be right to go back to the members and ask what they think,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a matter for the Labour Party, it is a matter between us and the employer,&quot; Johnson said, although he added that the suspension of the monopoly was a legitimate matter for Labour to pursue when parliament returns after its summer break.</p>
<p>Johnson is one of the strongest supporters among union leaders of Blair's modernisation of the Labour Party, which has included a loosening of union-Labour links. He was set to accept the latest offer from Royal Mail management but was overruled by his executive.</p>
