<p>Underdogs Portuguesa took the initiative in the Brazilian championship final on Wednesday, beating Gremio 2-0 at home in the first leg.</p>
<p>Gremio, using their customary physical and sometimes violent approach, played more than half the match with 10 men after having a player sent off, causing coach Luis Felipe Scolari to complain bitterly at the end.</p>
<p>&quot;The referee was a disgrace. Terrible, terrible,&quot; he moaned. &quot;He set up everything for Portuguesa.&quot;</p>
<p>The game was even until the 39th minute when Gremio full- back Marco Antonio was sent off for a second bookable offence, tripping striker Alex Alves as he homed in on the Gremio penalty area.</p>
<p>From the resulting free kick, midfielder Gallo, discarded by Santos earlier this year because at the age of 29 they conisdered him too old, floated in Portuguesa's first goal.</p>
<p>The goal provided a rare instance in Brazilian soccer of a team being punished for a cyncial foul while the red card appeared to deter Gremio, who had committed several wild tackles, from handing out further punishment.</p>
<p>With both teams concentrating on playing football, the second half was a thrilling affair with plenty of chances created at both ends.</p>
<p>Portuguesa's second came in the 60th minute when striker Rodrigo, the revelation of the whole tournament, beat a defender to a cross to slip the ball into the Gremio goal.</p>
<p>Portuguesa, a small club from Sao Paulo, have never reached the final before, their best previous performance being a modest seventh-place in 1989.</p>
<p>Gremio, champions in 1981, won the South American Libertadores Cup last year but made more enemies than friends because of their dour, physical play.</p>
<p>They need to win Sunday's second leg at home by two goals or more to win the competition. If the aggregate score is level, Gremio take the title on having the best overall record.</p>
