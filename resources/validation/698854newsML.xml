<p>Hong Kong celebrated its first day as part of China on Tuesday after 156 years of British colonial rule with a stunning firework and laser extravaganza.</p>
<p>Commerce in one of the world's busiest harbours ground to a halt after dark as a flotilla of 31 barges bearing animals and flowers formed out of garish gold, red and green lights circled between Hong Kong island and Kowloon.</p>
<p>Twenty tonnes of fireworks then lit the sky, bringing oohs, ahs and applause from a crowd of several hundred thousand people lining both sides of the harbour.</p>
<p>Thunderous explosions reverberated off the sheer glass and steel curtain walls of office towers in central Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Huge Roman candles sent shrill whistles into the night air as they ascended on columns of flame.</p>
<p>In a city not noted for understatement the business community spent HK$100 million (US$12 million) on the show, which included a massive harbour-front songfest of traditional Chinese tunes.</p>
<p>&quot;I was little bored by the barges but I think tonight's fireworks were better than last night's. The weather was a lot better, that's for sure,&quot; said Robert Cheung, an accountant who watched the show with his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Monday's handover ceremonies staged by the outgoing colonial government, which included their own dazzling fireworks displayed, took place in driving rain. Only a few sprinkles dampened Tuesday's display.</p>
<p>The centrepiece in Victoria harbour on Tuesday was a massive, transparent sphere illuminated by lights and lasers and said to represent both the unity of China and Hong Kong as the pearl of the Orient.</p>
<p>A small fire broke out on one of the barges launching the fireworks after the display ended, but was quickly put out, government and police spokesmen said. Five people were safely transferred off the 40-metre barge, they said.</p>
<p>Sentries on duty at the Prince of Wales barracks, vacated by British troops at midnight on Monday, spared not a glance for the fireworks as they stared straight ahead at their duty post.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a bit worried by the way these Chinese troops behave,&quot; said Hubert, a French businessman who brought his wife and two young children to the fireworks display.</p>
<p>&quot;They are like automatons. They display no emotion. We have passports and we can leave, but my Chinese friends in Hong Kong are not so lucky.&quot;</p>
<p>Tuesday was the fourth of five consecutive public holidays in Hong Kong in celebration of the territory's handover to China.</p>
