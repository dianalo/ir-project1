<headline>CSCE cocoa ends firmer, but drifts off highs.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-08-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE cocoa futures ended firmer in subdued  dealings on Friday, but prices drifted off session highs on scattered  mixed selling, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very, very quiet,&quot; said one trader. &quot;It was a big move, but  on no volume. Nobody can put a finger on this market because it's  moving on no volume at all.&quot;</p>
<p>September cocoa rose $4 per tonne on the day, to $1,517, after ranging  between $1,537 and $1,515. Second-month December also closed $4 firmer,  at $1,564, while the back months ended up $3.</p>
<p>Cocoa prices rose at the outset, defying pre-opening expectations,  on light speculative buying, traders said.</p>
<p>They said local short-covering by locals lifted the September contract  to the day's highs, but scale-up trade and light arbitrage selling  capped gains and prevented a test of chart resistance at $1,540.</p>
<p>On the charts, traders said that after the $1,540 level, September  would find resistance at $1,547-$1,550, followed by a gap between  $1,561 and $1,570. On the downside, support was seen at $1,513-$1,510  and then $1,500.</p>
<p>The latest CFTC Commitment of Traders report released late Friday  showed a decrease in speculative (non-commercials and nonreportable)  net long positions to 19,443 lots as of July 29, traders. The data,  which was in line with expectations, could encourage some speculators  to go long, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's as expected,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;But it might give specs a little  more buying power. They can be net long up to 30,000 or 40,000 lots.&quot;</p>
<p>On the fundamental side, CSCE said after the close on Friday that  certified cocoa stocks as of August 1 in New York, Delaware and Hampton  Roads warehouses totalled 4,059,047 tonnes against 4,571,114 tonnes  a year ago.</p>
<p>In other news, the president of Mexico's National Association of Cocoa  Producers, Laurence Rodriguez Torruco, estimated that the country's  1996-97 harvest will end between 50,000 and 55,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Mexico's cocoa production traditionally swings between around 30,000  tonnes in poor cycles and 47,000 tonnes in good cycles, according  to trade and government sources. The Agriculture Ministry does not  publish cocoa output data.</p>
<p>Turnover on the day reached an estimated 4,924 lots.</p>
