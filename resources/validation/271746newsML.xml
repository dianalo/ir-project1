<p>At least two Palestinians were taken to hospital after clashes in Hebron between Arabs and Israeli troops on Saturday, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Palestinians gathered in central Hebron after Jewish settlers scuffled with Palestinian schoolchildren in the town.</p>
<p>Soldiers intervened arresting at least two Arabs and pushing demonstrators away from the approach to one of the Jewish enclaves in Hebron.</p>
<p>Palestinian witnesses said the soldiers beat several demonstrators and two were rushed to hospital in Hebron. One suffered a head injury, the witnesses said.</p>
<p>An Israeli army spokeswoman said she was checking the report.</p>
<p>Hebron is a flashpoint for Arab-Israeli violence and a sticking point in peace talks beween Israel and the PLO.</p>
<p>Israeli troops were due to withdraw from most of the town last March under a peace deal with the PLO but hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded modifications to the agreement to help protect Hebron's 400 Jewish settlers.</p>
<p>American Middle East envoy Dennis Ross was due in the region later on Saturday to push forward talks on Hebron which have foundered for the last 10 weeks.</p>
