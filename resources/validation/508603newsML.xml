<p>Three Romanian companies will join the Bucharest bourse this week, bringing to 32 the total number of traded stocks, the exchange said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It said the newcomers were pharmaceutical maker Antibiotice SA, oil drilling company Foraj Sonde Ploiesti SA and hotelier Turism Transilvania SA.</p>
<p>The shares of Antibiotice will be traded on Bourse first tier, while other two shares will start to be traded on second-tier.</p>
<p>Antibiotice is a state-run company with a capital of 65.9 billion lei divided in shares with a nominal value of 1,000 lei each. The pharmaceutical maker was privatised under a mass selloff launched in 1995, whith 49 percent of its equity subscribed in exchange for coupons. The State Ownership Fund (FPS) has 51 percent.</p>
<p>Foraj Sonde SA Ploiesti has a share capital of 9.8 billion lei, or 392,176 shares with a nominal value of 25,000 lei each.</p>
<p>It was also privatised under the selloff, with 53 percent acquired for coupons, while the remaining 47 percent remained in the FPS portofolio, a stock exchange statement said.</p>
<p>The third company to join the bourse, state-run hotelier Turism Transilvania SA, has an equity capital of 34.67 billion lei in shares with a face value of 25,000 lei.</p>
<p>The FPS holds 70 percent from its capital, the Private Ownership Fund had 8.9 percent while other investors had 21.1 percent.</p>
<p>Traders said new listings were a good sign for the market's liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the newcomers on the bourse and I think the investors will be interesed to see other shares in trading which will boost the volumes and liquidity of the market&quot;, one broker said.</p>
<p>He adeed that new listings in Romania's pharmaceutical or chemical idustry would atract more foreign investors on local capital market.</p>
<p>The bourse has only three first-tier listings -- Azomures SA fertiliser maker, which has dominated the bourse since it opened late in 1995, and chemical plant Oltchim SA and pharmaceutical maker Terapia SA , both of which joined the market earlier this year.</p>
<p>Twenty-six companies are currently traded on the second tier. REUTER</p>
