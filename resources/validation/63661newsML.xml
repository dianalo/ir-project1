<p>The dollar reconquered lost ground against the mark as robust housing starts data and a surge in the prices paid components of the Philadelphia Fed survey kept interest rate rise speculation on the boil.</p>
<p>The U.S. unit also held its own against the yen after shedding over a yen on Wednesday in the wake of a large jump in the July trade deficit.</p>
<p>The Philly Fed survey sent mixed signals to the market, showing an unexpected slump in the overall reading to 13.9 in September from 21.5 in August while the prices paid and received components soared and reignited concern about inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;The prices components of the Philly Fed are a cause for concern in a market that's on the outlook for inflation,&quot; said David Bloom, currency economist at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>Bloom said the Philly Fed was the first indicator of prices pressure in 1994, fueling the markets' belief that inflation was on an uptrend, which helped to trigger the nine-month bear market in Treasuries that year.</p>
<p>The prices paid component rose to 18.0 from 4.6 in August, while prices received stood at 4.6 from a minus 3.0 reading.</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.5136/40 marks and 109.35/38 yen against 1.5090/93 and 109.30/40 in late European trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>U.S. housing starts for August were above expectations, up 4.5 percent to a 1.525 million annual rate against 1.44 million expected.</p>
<p>The dollar was also supported by another attack of the yen on the mark, traders said. Mark/yen recovered initially but lost ground again as a U.S. hedge fund was said to have sold large chunks of marks. Mark/yen stood at 72.21/24, down from a high at 72.48 and from 72.26/29 at the prevous European close.</p>
<p>Despite a firmer undertone the dollar remained capped ahead of offers in the 1.5150/60 area, also a tough technical resistance.</p>
<p>The market shrugged off an unexpected rise in annualised German M3 money supply growth in August to 8.7 percent from 8.6.</p>
<p>A modest rise in the Ifo German business sentiment survey for August to 94.4 frm 94.0 also failed to stir excitement as traders saw no fundamental change to the German interest rate outlook emanating from the data.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody believes that Germany will raise interest rates as long as EMU looks fragile so the mark must essentially be on a losing trend,&quot; said Tony Norfield, economist at ABN Amro.</p>
<p>The mark eased on most European crosses, setting a nine-month low against the Finnish markka below 3.0 per mark.</p>
<p>The market focus is now on early October as a possible data for a markka ERM fixing.</p>
<p>The French franc rose after the Bank of France eased the intervention rate by 10 basis points to 3.25 percent.</p>
<p>French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said the French deficit would be around 2.8 to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product, below the three percent threshold set in the Maastricht Treaty. The French franc was at 3.4025/30 per mark from 3.4070/75.</p>
<p>As expected, the Bundesbank kept official rates unchanged and fixed the repo again at 3.0 percent for the next three tenders.</p>
