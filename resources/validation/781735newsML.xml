<p>Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Wednesday it had approved the issuing of perpetual bonds by corporations.</p>
<p>The move was cited by traders as a key factor behind Wednesday's surge in Japanese banking stocks, as the issuance of perpetual bonds are expected to help banks reach minimum capital requirements by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>
<p>Perpetual bonds need not be redeemed as long as a firm exists as a corporation.</p>
<p>MOF's decision to allow the issue of perpetual bonds came in response to corporate needs, an official at MOF's Securities Bureau said.</p>
<p>&quot;The need by firms to increase their capital by issuing perpetual subordinated debt has been increasing recently... especially in relation to recent problems in the financial sector,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of investors, perpetual bonds can be attractive because their yields are higher than bonds with a specific maturity date.</p>
<p>The approval of perpetual bonds was among several financial reforms mapped out by the government in June and announced on July 31.</p>
<p>Under the commercial code, issuers of corporate bonds are required to give a specific maturity date.</p>
<p>But firms that wish to issue perpetual bonds can now legally circumvent this requirement by stating on the perpetual bonds that the bonds will be redeemed when the issuer comes under liquidation, the official said.</p>
