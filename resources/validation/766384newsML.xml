<p>Fourteen people were killed in a double suicide bombing in Jerusalem's main Jewish market on Wednesday in an attack that put the brakes on a U.S. effort to revive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Israeli police said two Arab suicide bombers wearing jackets and ties strolled into crowds of lunchtime shoppers at the Mahane Yehuda market in west Jerusalem with 10-kg (22-pound) bombs concealed in attache cases and blew themselves up.</p>
<p>Pulverised watermelons and eggplants mingled with blood and body parts on the ground while police, rescue workers and members of the public struggled to remove the dead and comfort the injured. Police put the number of wounded at more than 150.</p>
<p>&quot;There were two large explosions and then I saw body parts flying in the air. There was a big fireball right in my face,&quot; one witness said.</p>
<p>The near-simultaneous explosions, about 40 metres (yards) apart, were the deadliest attack in the Jewish state since a spate of Moslem militant suicide bombings in February and March 1996 killed at least 55 people.</p>
<p>There was no immediate reliable claim of responsibility.</p>
<p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, elected in May last year on a pledge to bolster security for Israelis, accused Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of reneging on commitments to halt extremist violence.</p>
<p>A close aide to Netanyahu, communications chief David Bar-Illan, said it would be &quot;virtually impossible&quot; for Israel to negotiate peace with the Palestinian Authority unless it &quot;changed its attitude to terrorism&quot;.</p>
<p>A drive by Washington to break a four-month-long impasse in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks following signs that both sides might be ready to resume negotiations was also a casualty of Wednesday's bombings.</p>
<p>U.S. envoy Dennis Ross had been due in the region for talks with Netanyahu and Arafat on Thursday but the White House said the trip would be put back for Israel to mourn its dead.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's bombing by terrorists in Jerusalem is a barbarous act. There is no excuse and there must be no tolerance for this kind of inhumanity,&quot; U.S. President Bill Clinton said.</p>
<p>&quot;The slaughter was aimed directly at innocent Israelis and, make no mistake, it was also aimed at the majority of Israelis, Palestinians and Arabs who want a lasting and just peace.&quot;</p>
<p>Arafat called Netanyahu to express his condolences but Netanyahu said: &quot;We expect not only words of condolences but also words of condemnation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the Palestinian Authority and its leader to begin to fight terror as they are committed to, as they haven't done until today, that they will take all the steps required against these terrorists and their operators who roam free,&quot; Netanyahu told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We aren't ready to accept that murderous acts will be part of our daily lives every few weeks and months and we will await suitable steps,&quot; he said after visiting wounded in hospital.</p>
<p>Netanyahu was meeting senior ministers and security chiefs to discuss Israel's response to the bombings.</p>
<p>In an immediate step, Israeli authorities imposed a closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, barring Palestinians from entering Israel or moving from their home locations.</p>
<p>Israeli army radio said Israelis had also been forbidden from entering Palestinian self-rule areas as anger swept the country.</p>
<p>Jewish demonstrators gathered near the scene of the carnage to chant &quot;Death to Arabs&quot; and anti-Netanyahu slogans. Police said they had arrested three right-wing activists for public order infringements.</p>
<p>The last big bombing to rock Israel, on March 21, killed three Israeli women along with the Palestinian bomber, and wounded 42 people at an outdoor cafe in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>That attack happened three days after Israel broke ground on a Jewish settlement on a hilltop in Arab East Jerusalem known to Israelis as Har Homa and to Palestinians as Jabal Abu Ghneim.</p>
<p>Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been in crisis since then, with Arafat insisting negotiations on a final peace agreement cannot take place until settlement activity stops.</p>
<p>Israel has countered that the Palestinian Authority must control militants and now accuses it of actively promoting violence.</p>
<p>&quot;Lately, it has actually organised police forces to strike, to make terrorist strikes against Israel, to mount a terrorist activity. That is totally unacceptable,&quot; Bar-Illan told Israeli Channel One television.</p>
<p>Arafat has said he was making a &quot;100 percent effort&quot; to stop Palestinian attacks but could not guarantee complete success.</p>
<p>Clinton pointedly urged Arafat's administration to halt extremists.</p>
<p>&quot;The only answer can and must be concrete steps by the Palestinian Authority to increase security operations and the strengthening of security cooperation between Palestinians and Israelis,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Clinton's condemnation of Wednesday's bombings was echoed by Israel's Arab neighbours Egypt and Jordan, by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and by the European Union.</p>
<p>The EU called in a statement on &quot;the government and people of Israel not to be provoked by those who want to torpedo peace&quot;.</p>
