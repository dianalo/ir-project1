<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif increased government support prices for wheat, rice and oilseeds in a package announced on Thursday aimed at boosting output.</p>
<p>He told a national farmers' convention in Islamabad his six-week-old government would announce more incentives for agriculture in the next few days with the aim to make Pakistan self-sufficient in food.</p>
<p>For now Sharif said the government's support prices to be paid to farmers for a unit of 40 kg had been increased for wheat by nearly 30 percent to 240 rupees ($5.97) from 185 rupees and by 25 percent for IRRI varieties of rice.</p>
<p>The support price for Canola oilseed had been increased 12.5 percent to 450 rupees from 400 rupees per 40 kg, and for sunflower about 17 percent to 450 rupees from 385, he said.</p>
<p>The package, which includes concessions in the price of some agricultural inputs and promises of better credit, follows economic reform measures announced by Sharif last Friday that slashed taxes and import tariffs.</p>
<p>The government says it plans to announce more measures to revamp and cut back state corporations, reform banking and capital markets and promote investment.</p>
<p>Thursday's package abolished sales tax on government-certified seeds, promised a cut in duties on locally made tractors and other agricultural machinery and reduced import duty on used and reconditioned harvesters to 10 percent from 35 percent.</p>
<p>Sharif said he wanted to see Pakistan self-sufficient in foodgrains within two years and declared fiscal 1997/98 (July-June) as a &quot;grow more wheat year&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it not shameful that a country having vast fertile land area, the world's best irrigation system, good weather conditions and strong and hard-working hands has to import wheat worth 25 billion rupees ($622 million) every year?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan was annually importing oilseeds worth 30 billion rupees, lentils costing three billion rupees and also sugar after being self-sufficient in the commodity for years.</p>
<p>&quot;The cotton crop was a pride for us but now we are forced to import cotton as well,&quot; he added.&quot;</p>
<p>Food and Agriculture Minister Abida Hussain, in her speech, attributed Pakistani agriculture's &quot;bleak scenario&quot; to small land holdings, soil erosion, productivity constraints, water loss, transfer of resources to other sectors and shifts of population from villages to cities.</p>
