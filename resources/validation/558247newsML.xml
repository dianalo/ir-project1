<p>Double Olympic gold medallist Michael Johnson was jeered before and after winning the 200 metres at the Rio de Janeiro athletics grand prix on Sunday.</p>
<p>Fans chanted abusive words as Johnson paraded in front of the main stand after the race, which he won in 20.29 seconds, comfortably beating fellow American Jon Drummond.</p>
<p>Johnson's popularity took a huge dip in Brazil after media reports alleged he had pushed away a young fan who had wanted to pose alongside him for a photograph at his hotel on Friday.</p>
<p>Canada's Donovan Bailey, running his first outdoor race this year, overcame weariness to win the 100 metres in 10.13.</p>
<p>The Olympic champion said he was not used to the early morning start.</p>
<p>Bailey and Johnson, who completed a unique double in Atlanta when he won the 200 and 400 metres, are involved in a showdown over 150 metres in Toronto on June 1 to find the &quot;world's fastest man&quot;.</p>
<p>Olympic champion Allen Johnson of the United States comfortably won the 110 metres hurdles but two women's Olympic champions were beaten.</p>
<p>Triple jump champion and world record holder Inessa Kravets of Ukraine finished third while Germany's Astrid Kumbernuss was second in the shot put behind Ukraine's Vita Pavlych.  </p>
<p>Newspaper reports claimed the young fan burst into tears after Johnson refused to be photographed at his Copacabana hotel.</p>
<p>Johnson, who wore purple running shoes instead of the famous gold pair he used at the Olympics, shrugged off the whole episode.</p>
<p>&quot;I came here to run my race. I've run it and now I'm going home. That's my job. I'm not here to worry about the crowd,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I've always had an excellent image everywhere I go. I've never had any problem like this before. I'm welcomed in Asia, in America and in Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the organisers said Johnson would happily have posed for the photograph with the admirer if the Brazilian media had not been at the hotel at the time.</p>
<p>A lethargic Bailey said he was too slow out of the blocks and finished poorly. He won by 0.13 seconds from American Terry Bowen.</p>
<p>&quot;My start needs improving, my first 30 metres needs improving and my last 30 metres needs improving,&quot; said Bailey.</p>
<p>&quot;I was not as relaxed as I could have been. But it was my first race of the year and you always make mistakes in your first race.&quot;</p>
<p>Bailey said the 10.30 a.m. start did not help. &quot;I had to get up at eight o'clock which was kind of difficult. I only get up that early to go to the airport.&quot;</p>
<p>Allen Johnson clocked 13.37 to win the hurdles ahead of Anier Garcia of Cuba and American Mark Crear.</p>
<p>&quot;I ran a good time and I liked my start,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kumbernuss, world and Olympic champion, could manage only 20.34 metres in the women's shot while Pavlych threw 20.73.</p>
<p>Kravets's best jump of 14.02 metres was way short her world record of 15.50, which she set in winning the world championship two years ago. The Czech Republic's Sarka Kasparova won with a best jump of 14.50.</p>
