<p>British engineering and controls giant Siebe Plc said on Thursday it would not be increasing its 155 pence per share offer for instruments and controls company Whessoe Plc after a rival bidding group on Wednesday offered 175 pence for the firm.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not believe that a significantly increased offer would be in the best interests of Siebe shareholders and the board has therefore decided not to increase the price that it is prepared to pay for Whessoe Plc,&quot; company chief executive Allen Yurko said in a statement.</p>
<p>Norway's Navia and Swiss Endress + Hauser launched a joint 52.6 million stg bid to top Siebe's 46 million stg offer, saying they would be able to achieve greater industrial synergies and could afford to pay a higher premium.  </p>
<p>&quot;Siebe's bid for Whessoe PLC was based on sound industrial logic and the clear synergy opportunities of integrating Whessoe's instrumentation product lines into Siebe's Control Systems Division,&quot; Siebe added.</p>
<p>It said its discussions with Whessoe management and due diligence, which included an analysis of its current trading, &quot;indicated that an offer of 155p per share was justified and indeed fair for both Whessoe and Siebe shareholders, a conclusion which was confirmed by the Whessoe directors' recommendation of the Siebe offer.&quot;</p>
<p>The European firms said on Wednesday, however, that Siebe's bid was launched only after they had approached Whessoe with a bid proposal.</p>
<p>Yurko added, &quot;Siebe shareholders will know that the Group applies strict criteria when looking at potential acquisitions, particularly with regard to product technology, growth potential and synergy opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Valuation, however, based on current trading conditions remains the overriding issue when considering an acquisition.&quot;</p>
<p>Siebe's shares edged up 2.0 pence to 967 pence during the day, while Whessoe shares returned to the bid level of 175 pence having been pushed over 180 pence yesterday on hopes that a bid battle might be joined.</p>
