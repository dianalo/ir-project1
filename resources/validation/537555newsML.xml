<p>A heavy amount of dollar selling interest related to various option positions is helping to cap the dollar's rise against the yen, option dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Various option positions were built up around 127 to 128 yen and they are generally deterring the dollar from advancing,&quot; said one options dealer.</p>
<p>They said these options include short-term exotic options, with large positions of so-called &quot;reverse knock-out&quot; options thought to have been taken with strike prices around 124 yen and knock-out prices of 127 to 127.30 yen.</p>
<p>These options would give holders the right to buy dollars at 124 yen, well below current levels, unless the dollar touches the knock-out price of 127.30 yen before the expiry, traders said.</p>
<p>Knock-out options are often favoured by speculators because they are cheaper than standard put and call options.</p>
<p>Holders of the options are rumoured to be selling the dollar when it nears 127 yen, in order to prevent their option positions from being knocked out, and this is helping to cap the dollar's moves against the yen, dealers said.</p>
<p>The option positions are said to be compounding other factors capping the dollar recently at 126.50 yen, including lingering fears of dollar-selling intervention by the Bank of Japan and caution ahead of Sunday's Group of Seven (G7) nations' meeting in Washington.</p>
<p>The dollar stood at 126.30 yen in late Tokyo trade on Thursday.</p>
<p>One options dealer at a trust bank said there was talk of speculative option positions held by overseas operators in which the holders would be paid a premium only if the dollar were to rise above 127 yen.</p>
<p>A senior dealer at a Japanese bank said those options were taken when the dollar was sticking to a 120 to 125 yen range before the Group of Seven (G7) nations' meeting in February in Berlin.</p>
<p>An options dealer at a U.S. bank said there were some operators who went heavily long of dollar call options with strikes at 127 to 128 yen in the past few months while building up dollar longs in the cash market.</p>
<p>While holding on to the dollar calls as their value rises, they have been taking profits on their cash positions above 126.50 yen, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;For traders who have held on to dollar call options, the strategy is to pick up spot dollars at around 125.50 yen and sell them above 126.50 yen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A clear break of 127.30 yen would send the dollar up by triggering stop-loss dollar buying, but gains may be slowed by various option positions which induce profit-taking above 127 yen, said an option dealer at a European bank.</p>
