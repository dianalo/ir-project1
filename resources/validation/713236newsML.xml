<p>The dollar rose to a new 3-1/2-year high against the mark Tuesday on news of a rise in German unemployment.</p>
<p>The dollar also got an indirect boost as the British pound resumed its powerful rally against the German currency.</p>
<p>The dollar surpassed 1.76 marks for the first time since Feburary 1994 after Germany reported a rise of 11,000 in unemployment for June.</p>
<p>Germany has been contending with the worst job market since World War II and odds of any interest rate hike that would make mark-denominated investments more attractive dim on every report showing the economy shedding jobs.</p>
<p>The most powerful move of the day came as the pound soared on news that the annual rate of British retail price inflation rose more than expected to 2.9 percent in June from 2.6 percent in May. The report heightened expectations that Britain will raise interest rates to cool consumer demand.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition of Germany's struggling economy against strong growth in Britain encouraged traders to sell marks for pounds, pushing the pound to its highest level against the mark since May 1991, said John Nelson, foreign exchange trading manager at ABN-AMRO Bank in Chicago.</p>
<p>&quot;The German unemployment number just continues to underline some of the domestic problems they're having and you also have talk of a base rate hike by the end of the week in the U.K.,&quot; Nelson said.</p>
<p>When investors sell marks for pounds, they often sell them against other currencies including the dollar.</p>
<p>The dollar rose to 1.7612 marks from 1.7530 late Monday. It edged up to $1.6880 British pounds from $1.6903.</p>
<p>The dollar was little changed at 112.85 Japanese yen, vs. 112.83 yen late Monday.</p>
<p>The yen continues to derive strength from a swelling Japanese trade surplus, and trading was cautious ahead of the release of May data on the surplus in Japan's current account, the broadest measure of trade, on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Booming Japanese exports have set off alarms in Washington and complaints that the yen's decline against the dollar earlier this year has flooded the U.S. with underpriced Japanese products.</p>
<p>&quot;The trade figures have already been released, but on a different basis -- customs cleared. They were up 222 percent, year over year,&quot; said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, a Connecticut consulting firm.</p>
<p>In other trade, the dollar rose to 1.4645 Swiss francs from 1.4612 late Monday. It fell to Canadian $1.3745 from C$1.3788.</p>
