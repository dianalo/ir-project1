<p>Following are some of the leading stories in the Swedish papers on Thursday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>DAGENS NYHETER</p>
<p>- Optimism from Wall Street sparked by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's comments spilled over onto the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Greenspan forecast moderate U.S. growth amid low inflation.</p>
<p>- Water levels in resevoirs are at normal levels following last year's drought. So far this year Swedish power companies have produced 35 percent more electricity from waterpower than at this time last year.</p>
<p>- Labour Minister Margareta Winberg says summer wages for young people, which have been reported to be as low as eight crowns an hour, are scandalous. She vows to help improve the system of temporary summer work.</p>
<p>- Air fares, especially on charter flights, will be more expensive when tax free sales are outlawed on July 1, 1999. Cheaper countries outside the European Union -- like Turkey, Cyprus, Malta or Israel -- could become extremely popular tourist destinations.</p>
<p>SVENSKA DAGBLADET</p>
<p>- The summer's hot share prices got a kick from European and U.S. optimism on Wednesday, with the Stockholm Stock Exchange ending one percent higher in heavy turnover.</p>
<p>- The world's biggest companies increased their profits by a record high 25 percent last year, Fortune magazine shows. At the same time humanitarian aid from western countries fell to an all-time low. Four Swedish companies -- Volvo, LM Ericsson, Electrolux and Skandia -- made the list of the top 500 companies. Ericsson, now at 191, made the sharpest climb up the list among Swedish companies: 82 places higher since last year.</p>
<p>- Most Swedes who put a web site on the Internet are breaking a law because they fail to obtain the proper permission from Swedish authorities.</p>
<p>DAGENS INDUSTRI</p>
<p>- Published only on Fridays in the summer.</p>
