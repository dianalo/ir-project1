<p>Former Algerian minister and political leader Abdelhamid Mehri said on Wednesday he did not believe Algeria's parliamentary elections next June would end his country's political crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;Violence is a common phenomenon in the Arab world but more radical in Algeria...I do not think that Algeria's legislative elections of June 5 will solve the country's political crisis,&quot; Mehri said.</p>
<p>Nor could the &quot;security solution&quot; solve the issue of violence in the Arab world, including Algeria, he said.</p>
<p>Mehri, who headed Algeria's powerful National Liberation Front (FLN) from late 1988 until 1995, called for talks with all parties including the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) to try to resolve the fighting in Algeria between the security forces and Islamist rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;From my point of view, only dialogue with all parties, including with FIS leaders, can put an end to the continuing violence in Algeria,&quot; said Mehri, still an influential member of the FLN, which governed Algeria as a single-party state for nearly three decades.</p>
<p>Algeria has ruled out talks with the FIS, whose candidates won most seats in the first round of the last general election in December 1991. The authorities cancelled the poll the following month and violence, in which about 60,000 people have died, erupted shortly after. The country has been without an elected parliament since.</p>
<p>The outlawed FIS is barred from taking part in the next election.</p>
<p>Algerian President Liamine Zeroual, who sees multi-party parliamentary elections as a way of bringing his country out of crisis, has set June 5 as the election date.</p>
<p>Mehri was speaking before a meeting of the seventh Arab Nationalist Congress attended by around 150 Arab nationalist politicians, intellectuals and trade unionists in Morocco's financial centre of Casablanca.</p>
<p>The Algerian politician, who is the secretary-general of the congress, said continuing violation of human rights in certain Arab countries was not just the result of &quot;mistakes&quot; by security men and police but &quot;a state policy to control citizens&quot;.</p>
<p>The Casablanca meeting is expected to discuss democracy, human rights, security and urgent social issues in the Arab world, a delegate said.</p>
<p>A 100-page report to be examined by the delegates, said: &quot;The situation of human rights and basic liberties deteriorated in 1996 in most Arab countries...Repression and state violence is taking place between the governments and opposition groups, including Moslem fundamentalists.&quot;</p>
<p>It did not name any countries.</p>
<p>Former Algerian President Ahmed Ben Bella and Algeria's Islamic Hamas party leader Mahfoud Nahnah are expected to address the congress, officials said.</p>
