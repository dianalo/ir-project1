<p>Barrick Gold Corp said Wednesday that proven and probable reserves rose 40 percent to 51 million ounces in 1996, chiefly due to its newly acquired Pierina Mine in Peru and the addition to reserves at the Pascua Mine on the El Indio belt in Chile.</p>
<p>Barrick said its 1996 gold output increased slightly, to 3.148 million ounces from 3.141 million in 1995.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, production fell to 797,097 ounces from 922,943 a year earlier.</p>
<p>The company also boosted reserves at the Betze-Post and Meikle Mines on its Goldstrike property in Nevada and brought in 1.2 million ounces from the High Desert joint venture property on the Carlin Trend.</p>
<p>&quot;We acquired Lac Minerals Ltd in 1994 for the potential of the El Indio Belt and acquired Arequipa Resources Ltd in 1996 for the potential of a range of outstanding properties assembled by David Lowell in Peru -- of which Pierina is the first to be drilled,&quot; Barrick chairman Peter Munk said in a statement. &quot;Our confidence in these two acquisitions has already been more than justified.&quot;  </p>
<p>Barrick also reported 25 million ounces of resources.</p>
<p>The company added 8.1 million ounces to Pascua reserves for a total of 10 million ounces, and bought 6.5 million ounces into reserves at Pierina. Both deposits are still open.</p>
<p>&quot;The company is very encouraged by early results at the Pierina Mine project,&quot; Barrick said.</p>
<p>It confirmed that the deposit is open to the east and south and identified 760,000 ounces of resources in addition to the reserves. The Pierina Mine is scheduled to come into production in late 1999, at an expected rate of 500,000 ounces of gold per annum, Barrick said.</p>
