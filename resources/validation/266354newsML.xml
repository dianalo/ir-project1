<p>Dutch title-chasers Feyenoord will talk to Scotland's Glasgow Celtic on Friday about a possible transfer deal which would take unsettled Netherlands striker Pierre van Hooijdonk back home.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be speaking to Celtic tomorrow to discuss the conditions to bring Pierre van Hooijdonk to Feyenoord,&quot; the Dutch club's chairman Jorien van den Herik said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Feyenoord originally wanted the player on loan, but now a permanent move might be on if they can meet Celtic's asking price, expected to be in the region of four million pounds ($6.6 million).</p>
<p>&quot;When our attempt to get him on loan fell through, we let Celtic know that we'd be interested in buying him,&quot; van den Herik was quoted as saying by Dutch daily Algemeen Dagblad. &quot;That doesn't now look impossible.&quot;</p>
<p>Van Hooijdonk joined Celtic from NAC Breda for 1.5 million pounds ($2.5 million) in January 1995. He has scored more than 50 goals during his two years in Scotland and is Celtic's top scorer this season with 11 strikes from 15 starts.</p>
<p>But he had several clashes with manager Tommy Burns over everything from his salary to his attitude.</p>
<p>He reportedly angered Celtic by deriding a wage offer of 7,000 pounds ($11,600) a week as &quot;enough for the homeless but not for a top international striker&quot; and snubbed Burns in September by refusing to warm up for a UEFA Cup match in Hamburg.</p>
<p>This week he allegedly refused to have an injection for a groin injury received while on international duty.</p>
