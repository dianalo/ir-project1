<headline>Broward County, Fla., faces flow control lawsuit.</headline>
<dateline>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla 1996-11-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>A trash-hauling company has sued Florida's Broward County, asking a federal judge to invalidate a 1987 law requiring that all trash collected in the county be taken to county incinerators.</p>
<p>The incinerators charge dumping fees of $79 a ton, more than double the fees of landfills within easy driving distance, said plaintiff Coastal Carting.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel it's unconstitutional. The Supreme Court says it's unconstitutional. The only one that doesn't think it's unconsitutional is Broward County,&quot; said Coastal general manager George Cinnante told the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel.</p>
<p>The two incinerators were financed with a $705 million of industrial revenue bonds issued by the county on Dec 27, 1984. The incinerators were built by Wheelebrator Technologies Inc, a subsidiary of WMX Technologies that also runs the facilities.</p>
<p>The conduit financing agreement carries a &quot;put or pay requirement&quot; that would oblige the county to make up for any revennue shortfall if trash collections are inadequate to pay debt service, county finance director Phillip Allen said.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in October and is still pending in U.S. District Court.</p>
<p>Coastal attorneys said the county law is an illegal restraint of interstate commerce and creates an illegal monopoly from the county's trash. They said similar laws have been overturned in several places, most recently in Hennepin County, Minn.</p>
<p>Coastal is asking that Broward County pay damages for forcing Coastal to bring its trash to the incinerators, plus attorney fees and other costs.</p>
<p>Broward County's attorneys argued last week that the lawsuit should be dismissed. They said the county is not soley responsible for the trash system.</p>
<p>Twenty-three Broward County cities signed agreements to bring all their trash to the incinerators and should also be held accountable, they said.</p>
<p>Only five Broward County cities declined to join the regional system -- Hallandale, Dania, Parkland, Pembroke Pines and Pompano Beach.</p>
