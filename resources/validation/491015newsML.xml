<headline>Indonesia says Horta's Timor torture claim false.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-04-07</dateline>

<p>Indonesia said on Monday that Nobel Peace laureate Jose Ramos Horta's claim that he had fresh evidence of widespread torture in East Timor was &quot;a lot of nonsense&quot;.</p>
<p>Horta said on Sunday in Geneva that he would give a video of photographs purportedly showing East Timorese youths being tortured by Indonesian soldiers to the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions.</p>
<p>&quot;We doubt the (authenticity) of the pictures. It is unclear when they were taken,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Ghaffar Fadyl told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This is in conformity with Horta's propaganda...using lies and distortion to discredit Indonesia, especially since he received the Nobel Prize,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The pictures show khaki-clad men apparently torturing young men using sticks, chairs, electric shocks and chains. In one sequence, two youths are tied to a tree and apparently hit with a shovel.</p>
<p>Another appears to show corpses being burned.</p>
<p>But it was impossible to independently authenticate the pictures.</p>
<p>Horta also said: &quot;It (the video of the photographs) shows a pattern of systematic, gross, widespread human rights violations. If anything, it shows it is not isolated... This is evidence of a pattern of the most brutal kind.&quot;</p>
<p>Fadyl said that Horta's statement was full of nonsense. &quot;This is a lot of nonsense, which he repeats from time to time...and which we are bored of listening to,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony of East Timor in December 1975 and still maintains a heavy military presence in the territory that it unilaterally annexed in July 1976 in an act not recognised by the United Nations.</p>
<p>Horta, who won the Nobel peace prize last year jointly with respected East Timorese bishop Carlos Belo, said he believed the pictures were genuine.</p>
<p>He said church sources had recently smuggled the pictures out of mainly Roman Catholic East Timor.</p>
<p>East Timorese sources said they believed the pictures had been taken in or around the northeastern town of Baucau between October 1995 and December 1996.</p>
<p>Indonesia has consistently denied allegations of torture and other human rights abuses in East Timor, although human rights groups such as Amnesty International say such practices are widespread.</p>
