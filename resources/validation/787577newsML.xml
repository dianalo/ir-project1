<p>Although the rise of Estonian shares during July and August has been meteoric, prices may not yet have peaked and a stockmarket crash is seen as unlikely, dealers and analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>At worst, a short-term correction may take place, they said.</p>
<p>Since the start of July the Talse Index has soared by around 50 percent. Since the start of the year, the Estonian bourse has jumped a massive 158 percent or 253.2 points to 413.20 at the close of trade Thursday.</p>
<p>Over the past five weeks, usually a slow period, leading bank Hansapank, which accounts for 40 percent of the market, has risen 84.9 kroons or 63 percent to 219.90 kroons while second-largest bank Hoiupank jumped 110 kroons or 75 percent to 256.</p>
<p>&quot;The fundamentals from the companies' first-half results are very good and all the news out of Estonia is good,&quot; said Katri Kumpulainen, London-based analyst with Societe Generale.</p>
<p>Kumpulainen said the Talse bourse was a &quot;liquidity-driven market&quot; and thus subject to sharp price swings -- a view shared by James Oates, analyst at UBS in London.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a small bourse so a small amount of money can move it a long way,&quot; said Oates.</p>
<p>There were rumours foreign investors were fuelling the boom in prices, but both local dealers and foreign analysts see the gains as locally driven.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing foreign investors as the net sellers at present and it looks to be mostly local investment that is keeping the bourse up,&quot; a local senior trader said.</p>
<p>The most recent rise came on news the EU Commission recommended Estonia to start talks to join the European Union along with Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia.</p>
<p>&quot;News that Estonia would be included in the first wave of EU expansion did have an effect and the local market viewed it very positively,&quot; said Nomura analyst Martin Gollner.</p>
<p>&quot;It is good news for the medium term but local brokers seem to be bidding up the market on that news,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Estonia has a strong local investor base with institutional and private investors placing more funds in equities.</p>
<p>But despite the sharp gains, investors appetite for Estonian shares does not appear to be dying out just yet and a correction, although likely, may not come for several more weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices are seen to be high but while the fundamentals of the companies remain good there is no expectation of a big downward correction,&quot; a senior dealer said.</p>
<p>In terms of price/earnings, Estonia at 15.2 is approaching Hungary at 15. Poland is rated at 11.6 while the Czech republic is at 10.8, analysts said.</p>
<p>But givens Hansapank's huge weighting in the Talse Index, comparisons with other bourses are difficult, Kumpulainen said.</p>
<p>With the approach of large privatisations in Latvia and Lithuania, interest is expected to focus on the neighbouring bourses, allowing Estonia to cool.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect some interest in the markets of the other two Baltic countries especially with the privatisation of large companies under way,&quot; Nomura's Gollner said.</p>
