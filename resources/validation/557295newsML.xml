<p>June BTP futures traded on LIFFE will look to the upside towards 129.05 on Friday but the contract may be in for a short-term correction, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Near term I'm looking for bit of a correction lower, but I'm not sure how deep this is going to get,&quot; said Robin Wilkin, senior technical analyst at MCM YieldWatch in London.</p>
<p>&quot;But overall the current bull run remains in place and we're really looking for it to push up towards the 129.05 high set on March 15 and 17.&quot;</p>
<p>At 0711 GMT, June BTP futures were at 128.07, down 0.18.  </p>
<p>Wilkin said the market could push up to the area between 128.75 and 129.05, but was not likely to get through that high for now.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent action over the past week or so has gone down through 125.94, so I'm still medium to long-term bearish,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>David Wood, an independent technical analyst near London, also said 129.05 was a major high for BTPs and the projected target, with some initial resistance in the 128.55 to 60 zone.</p>
<p>&quot;But BTPs may be getting sucked in at top end. The market looks over done in short term at least,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Traders on the LIFFE floor said the market must hold above 128.00 to maintain the upward bias. However if it failed at this level a rapid fall back to 127.70 and 127.55 was expected.</p>
<p>A downtrend resistance level at 128.45, was attracting the market but it had so far failed to launch a significant attack on that level. If it breaks then 129.00 is called into play, they said.</p>
<p>Wood agreed there was reasonable support in an old resistance area around 128.00 to 127.85.</p>
<p>&quot;If it can pick up strength from there it is looking very good still,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>But MCM's Wilkin said current gains from 125.80 still looked corrective at the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;If we get through 129.05 then we would...probably be looking for a move up to the 130-131 congestion area,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At the short end June Eurolira futures were st 93.22, down 0.03 on the day.</p>
