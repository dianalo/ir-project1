<p>Late-session profit-taking pared early gains by Manila shares as investors remained defensive amid the fragile foreign exchange and money markets, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some follow-through buying but it was supported by relatively light turnover, so it was not sustained,&quot; Juanis Barredo, a technical analyst of Citisecurities, said.</p>
<p>He said even some secondary and tertiary issues which led the active gainers lost steam by late session.</p>
<p>&quot;This indicates a negative sentiment in the market,&quot; Barredo said.  </p>
<p>The composite index eked out a minimal 0.25 point rise to settle at 2,592.46 points.</p>
<p>Uncertainties still ruled the foreign exchange and money markets despite the three-percentage point cut in the central bank's benchmark rates. The regional currencies were still under pressure from speculators.</p>
<p>Noel Reyes, vice president of Anscor Hagedorn Securities, said economic fundamentals remained unclear especially after the de facto devaluation of the peso earlier this month.</p>
<p>&quot;We do see the downward drift to continue in the coming days,&quot; Barredo said.  </p>
<p>Among the most heavily traded issues were PLDT which remained unchanged at 925 pesos and Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co Inc which rose five pesos to 545 pesos.</p>
