<title>PAKISTAN: Ninety-seven killed in Pakistan sectarian clashes.</title>

<p>Pakistan said on Sunday 97 people were killed and 89 injured last week in clashes between rival Moslem sects in a remote northwest border region.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar told parliament normality had since been restored to the Kurram Agency tribal area, near the Afghan border, where the clashes between militants of the majority Sunni and minority Shi'ite sects erupted last Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pakistani newspapers earlier reported that up to 200 people were killed in the clashes in which both sides used automatic weapons, mortars and rockets.</p>
<p>Babar, quoted by the official APP news agency, said he had ordered the closure of some Islamic religious schools which he believed had fanned sectarian feelings.</p>
<p>The government had also compiled a list of suspected instigators of the violence, he said.</p>
<p>Sunni-Shi'ite disputes over Islamic beliefs have often spilled into violence and the Kurram Agency tribal area clashes followed a series of sectarian attacks this year in the central province of Punjab and the southern province of Sindh.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, the leader of the Shi'ite militant Sipah-i-Mohammad group, Murid Abbas Yazdani, was killed by unknown gunmen at his house in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Eighteen people were killed in a sectarian clash on August 18 when gunmen attacked a Shi'ite meeting in Punjab province.</p>
<p>Sunnis dominate Pakistan's population of about 130 million, of which Shi'ites constitute about 15 percent.</p>
