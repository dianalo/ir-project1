<p>U.N. agencies, dismissing statements by Rwanda that the vast majority of refugees have returned home, stepped up the search on Thursday for some 700,000 missing people believed scattered across eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>The U.N. said it had succeeded in sending an assessment team into Bukavu, but had been denied access by Tutsi rebels to the town of Sake further north where several thousand more Hutu refugees are thought to have massed since last weekend's exodus.</p>
<p>&quot;We are being denied access to Sake after a lengthy meeting with Commander (Andre) Kassesse during which I was hardly allowed to say anything,&quot; Filippo Grandi, head of the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR in Goma told Reuters.</p>
<p>Access was also denied by the rebels to journalists and the Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) aid agency.</p>
<p>Some 200,000 refugees, many of whom fled fighting into the bush, are still believed to be in that area and a further 500,000 further south near Bukavu, south of Lake Kivu.</p>
<p>&quot;We are absolutely desperate to locate these 700,000,&quot; Peter Kessler, UNHCR spokesman in Nairobi, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said an assessment team had gone to Bukavu on Wednesday, but had been told by Zairean rebels, backed by Rwanda, that all camps in the area were now empty and the refugees had fled several hundred km (miles) westwards and southwards.</p>
<p>&quot;But I stress, there is no independent confirmation of that, that is why we need people in there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Zairean rebels have up until now prevented aid agencies from entering Bukavu to gain a first-hand picture.</p>
<p>Rwanda, always reluctant to see a U.N. multinational force in the region, maintains nearly all the refugees returned in a human wave which started last week, a fact which -- if true -- could have a crucial impact on plans to send a U.N. force.</p>
<p>Major-General Paul Kagame, vice-president and defence minister of Rwanda, said in Kigali on Wednesday he believed the numbers of refugees in camps in Zaire had been exaggerated.</p>
<p>The Hutu refugees fled Rwanda in 1994 in the wake of a massacre of up to a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus blamed chiefly on the former Rwandan army and Interahamwe militia.</p>
<p>About 500,000 Hutu refugees have now returned to Rwanda to escape a new war pitting Zairean rebels against soldiers from the remnants of Rwanda's ex-army and the militias who fled along with the refugees.</p>
<p>The four-member assessment team comprising UNHCR, WFP, the U.N. Children's Fund and a British army official was expected to return to Cyangugu on Rwanda's Zaire border later on Thursday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canada, the country set to lead any multinational intervention, said on Thursday military leaders from countries expected to send troops would finally meet on Friday in Germany. The meeting was originally scheduled for Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;In general terms, the meeting will be held to determine and decide on the general scope of the mission,&quot; Canadian Navy Reserve Lieutenant Charles Brown told Reuters.</p>
<p>Military leaders from several nations including the United States, France, Britain and Canada were expected to attend the meeting, which was called to review plans for the mission endorsed by the U.N. before last week's mass return.</p>
<p>Canada said most nations involved in the humanitarian crisis believed a military force was still needed to deliver aid to refugees and displaced Zaireans scattered through the war-torn Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>Emma Bonino, the European Union's humanitarian aid Commissioner, accused the world community on Thursday of indifference bordering on racism over the plight of the stranded refugees.</p>
<p>&quot;How many lives have to be in danger, how many people missing to justify a deployment of troops by the civilised world'? Who sets the threshold -- is it 500,000, 200,000, 100,000 or 10,000?&quot; she said at the European Parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it the colour of their skin which makes the difference, which leads us to believe that it is their inevitable lot to be linked to a cycle of...massacres?&quot;</p>
<p>Bonino said a proposed U.N. multinational force was essential to allow humanitarian aid workers to save lives in Zaire. Without that protection, aid workers risked being killed and taken hostage, she said.</p>
<p>In an interview broadcast on Thursday, Zaire's ailing ruler Mobutu Seke Seko told CNN he was &quot;fine&quot; and promised to return home from the French Riviera once his recovery from cancer treatment was complete.</p>
<p>He termed the rebels who have taken over a swathe of eastern Zaire and their supporters as &quot;devils&quot; who profited from his absence, adding: &quot;They stabbed me in the back while I was away. Do you think this would have happened if I were there? No. Never.&quot;</p>
