<title>USA: U.S. current account set record in third quarter.</title>

<p>The U.S. current account gap, the broadest measure of the nation's trade performance, widened to a record during the third quarter because of a deteriorating trade and investment performance, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the three months from July through September, the deficit shot up 19 percent to $47.96 billion from $40.21 billion in the second quarter this year. It surpassed the previous record shortfall of $43.2 billion set nearly nine years ago in the fourth quarter of 1987.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase was accounted for by increases in the deficits on goods and services and on investment income,&quot; the department said.</p>
<p>Current account is the country's broadest trade statistic because it measures business with the rest of the world not only in goods and services, but also takes into account investment flows between countries and grants made to foreign nations.</p>
<p>Virtually every aspect of trade weakened in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The deficit on goods and services grew to $33.8 billion from $28.6 billion in the second quarter. The department said exports of goods were weaker while imports increased and the surplus on services dropped off because of declines in travel and in passenger fares.</p>
<p>The deficit on investment income more than doubled to $4.7 billion during the third quarter from $2.3 billion in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Commerce said that income receipts from U.S.-owned assets overseas increased slightly to $48.3 billion from $48 billion in the second quarter.</p>
<p>But income payments made on foreign-owned assets in the United States climbed strongly to $53 billion in the third quarter from $50.3 billion in the second quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;U.S. government payments rose strongly, reflecting substantial foreign acquisitions of U.S. Treasury securities in recent quarters,&quot; the department said.</p>
<p>Net foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities were a record $42 billion in the third quarter, compared with $31.2 billion in the second quarter.</p>
<p>The department said the jump &quot;partly reflected a shift in investor preferences from stocks to bonds&quot; during the third quarter.</p>
