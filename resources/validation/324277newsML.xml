<p>President Boris Yeltsin, who put in a brief appearance at the Kremlin on Wednesday, should be able to go back to work properly in two or three weeks, chief presidential doctor Sergei Mironov said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that now two or three weeks will be enough for him to get himself back to work,&quot; Mironov told ORT television.</p>
<p>But he also chided the Russian leader, who will be 66 on February 1, for being too hasty in efforts to show he was fit for work after getting out of hospital on Monday following two weeks of treatment for double pneumonia.</p>
<p>Mironov explained that an ordinary person would generally need two to three weeks in hospital and two or three weeks of convalescence after falling ill with pneumonia. Yeltsin became ill on January 6 and went into hospital two days later.</p>
<p>The president, clearly determined to show he is fit to rule Russia as the opposition-dominated parliament debated a motion to oust him on health grounds, went to the Kremlin on Wednesday for the first time since he was taken ill.</p>
<p>His press service said he had a meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>&quot;His present condition is quite satisfactory, if we can talk like that of someone who has had pneumonia,&quot; Mironov said.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course he has asthenia, that is he is rather quick to tire... He doesn't feel very comfortable and he is trying to make it up in every way possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Mironov added: &quot;Of course he's in a hurry, and being hasty.&quot;</p>
