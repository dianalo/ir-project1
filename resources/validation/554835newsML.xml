<headline>Australia study urges major shipping reforms.</headline>

<p>An Australian government study on Thursday urged sweeping reforms to shipping to cut costs and boost competitiveness to revitalise the flagging industry.</p>
<p>The Shipping Reform Group's recommendations include labour reforms, a second register for ships to allow foreign crews, international competition on coastal routes and tax concessions.</p>
<p>Reform group chairman Julian Manser said in a statement that business, unions and the government had to co-operate to save the industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless this happens, the Australian industry will continue to rapidly decline,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Transport Minister John Sharp said the report would be open to public comment and the government would consult industry groups before deciding its response.</p>
<p>&quot;It offers the prospect of a blueprint for future growth, more jobs for Australians at sea and on shore and for reduced costs for our exporters and importers after years of reform which has failed to keep our merchant fleet competitive,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Sharp said the reforms could cut Australia's annual current account deficit -- forecast at A$20 billion in 1996/97 -- by up to A$650 million.  </p>
<p>The reform group recommended more flexible working arrangements, ships on a second register with an Australian master and chief engineer but with the option of a foreign crew under certain circumstances, and an end to restrictions on international competition along coastal routes over 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>It also urged a series of tax concessions, including income tax exemption for Australian resident seafarers on certain vessels, accelerated depreciation, rollover of funds from selling a ship if the capacity was replaced within three years and some payroll tax exemptions.  </p>
<p>Australia's militant maritime trade unions have said they would oppose the use of foreign crews on Australian vessels and of foreign vessels on coastal routes, which are now reserved for Australian-registered ships.</p>
