<p>Romania's chief prosecutor said on Thursday illegal adoptions of babies were still widespread despite recent legislation cracking down on unscrupulous baby-traders.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1996, when I took over I found that many adoptions were illegal and the fate of Romanian babies adopted by foreign foster parents ambiguous,&quot; Nicolae Cochinescu told a meeting of leading prosecutors open to the press.</p>
<p>Cochinescu said a 1990 child adoption law, passed a year after the fall of communism, had opened the way for international adoptions but most were illegal.</p>
<p>Romania's centrist government, which defeated ex-communists in last year's election, recently issued a decree to stop traders taking advantage of foreigners willing to pay thousands of dollars for one of Romania's 100,000 abandoned children.</p>
<p>The new rules simplify procedures for adoptive parents but stipulate that adoptions may be completed only through authorised agencies.</p>
<p>An average 2,500 children have been legally adopted by foreigners annually since the 1989 overthrow of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. But aid groups say another 10,000 may have gone illegally, some to inappropriate homes.</p>
<p>The advent of democracy produced pictures beamed around the world of filthy orphanages filled with abandoned children in a country where abortion and contraception had been banned.</p>
<p>Cochinescu accused Romanian courts examining adoption cases of ignoring legal protections for orphans. He said more than 2,500 adoptions had been processed without the required approval of the Romanian Adoption Committee, a government watchdog set to crack down on trade in babies.</p>
<p>Spanish authorities, he said, had notified his office of 612 Romanian babies brought into the country illegally.</p>
<p>&quot;These babies could not get Spanish citizenship and are now regarded as abandoned children there,&quot; Cochinescu said.</p>
<p>Some courts, he said, had authorised foreign adoptions of babies a month old, violating rules that abandoned children must first be offered to Romanians for a six-month period.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't tell me this is not trade when the same court clears 30 adoption cases in one day, all involving children of less than two months old,&quot; Cochinescu said. &quot;In most cases the deal is struck well before the child is born.&quot;</p>
<p>Newspapers frequently report on legal action taken against alleged baby traders. On Thursday, the Bucharest daily Evenimentul Zilei said a court in eastern Romania had released a group of alleged traffickers for lack of evidence.</p>
