<p>Top Indian and Pakistani diplomats began a new round of peace talks on Friday, and a spokesman said they hoped to devise a mechanism for future meetings between the arch-rival neighbours.</p>
<p>The two-hour afternoon session was devoted to &quot;identifying the outstanding issues and devising a mechanism to address these issues in a purposeful manner&quot;, a Pakistani spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;The discussions were thorough and result-oriented,&quot; he told reporters after the meeting, which was presided over by Indian foreign ministry secretary Salman Haider and his Pakistani counterpart Shamshad Ahmad.</p>
<p>Asked if the two sides would be able to devise a mechanism for future talks at the four-day round in Islamabad, the spokesman said: &quot;We are very hopeful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are moving in a positive way,&quot; Haider said after the meeting, which resumed a dialogue that the two sides had launched in March.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going in with a positive spirit and a positive approach,&quot; he earlier told reporters as he arrived at Punjab House in Islamabad, where he was greeted warmly by Ahmad.</p>
<p>Ahmad put his arm around Haider as the delegations walked inside. The two teams sat facing each other over a long table as they posed for cameramen before starting a brief formal session, where the spokesman said they stated their positions on resolving differences. A restricted informal session followed.</p>
<p>&quot;We were not talking in the air. We not taking for the sake of talking. The idea was to arrive at conclusions,&quot; the Pakistani spokesman said.</p>
<p>Asked if he had the mandate to discuss the India-Pakistan dispute over the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir, Haider said: &quot;We are in the process of identifying all the issues which will come up for discussion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our immediate task is to...focus on the modalities, methodology and structure of dialogue,&quot; Haider told reporters at Islamabad airport on Thursday night. &quot;The agenda is to continue our discussions of which we already had one round in Delhi.&quot;</p>
<p>Ahmad made clear that Pakistan wanted to place the Kashmir dispute, which has sparked two of the three wars fought with India since independence in 1947, high on the agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;It is our earnest desire, and it will be our endeavour, to focus on this issue as part of our overall attempt to find a peaceful solution of all problems that face us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Apart from an agreement to pursue the dialogue, little emerged from the first round of talks in Delhi in March, but they paved the way for the two foreign ministers to meet in April and the two prime ministers to get together in May.</p>
<p>On Thursday Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral of India and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif spoke for the first time on a telephone hotline set up to help dispel mistrust between the two long-time foes.</p>
<p>Gujral and Sharif had agreed to set up the direct phone link between their two offices when they met for the first time in the Maldives last month on the margins of a regional summit.</p>
<p>The Delhi meeting of foreign secretaries resumed a dialogue which foundered in 1994 over the issue of Kashmir, two-thirds of which is ruled by India and the rest by Pakistan.</p>
