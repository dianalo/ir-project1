<title>ALBANIA: Albania plans crackdown on pyramid schemes.</title>

<p>Albania is preparing a crackdown on get-rich-quick schemes that have wiped out the savings of thousands of small investors, sparked protests in the streets and prompted calls for the resignation of Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi.</p>
<p>The daily newspaper Albania, which is close to the ruling Democratic Party, said on Saturday party leaders would try to halt the growth of the pyramid schemes and put forward a plan to reimburse those who lost their money.</p>
<p>Three dubious investment groups have collapsed in the past few weeks in Albania, Europe's poorest country, and three other funds have suspended payments.</p>
<p>Angry investors clashed with police on Wednesday while besieging the home of one of the promoters.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Democratic Party said the crisis would top the agenda at a meeting of the party's 105-member national council on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pyramid schemes boomed in the Balkan nation after the fall of communism in 1990, luring thousands of Albanians into selling homes, land and livestock with promises of big returns on small sums invested.</p>
<p>The government on Thursday ordered the seizure of some 25.5 billion leks ($255 million) deposited by investment schemes in the country's commercial banks.</p>
<p>Azem Hajdari, a key figure in Albania's 1990 democratic revolution, on Friday called on Prime Minister Meksi to resign.</p>
<p>Hajdari, who now heads one of the country's leading labour unions, said the funds were a &quot;big swindle&quot;, but added that he did not support opposition calls for a peaceful protest against the investment schemes on Sunday.</p>
<p>The opposition Democratic Alliance Party (DAP) also called for the government's resignation.</p>
<p>&quot;The government should resign because it has allowed the space that should have been occupied by banks to be occupied by pyramid schemes,&quot; DAP president Neritan Ceka said.</p>
<p>Meksi was nominated for a second term as prime minister after a controversial general election in May and June of last year which was boycotted by most opposition parties amid claims the Democrats had manipulated the vote.</p>
