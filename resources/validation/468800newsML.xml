<p>A Zairean rebel representative, in Togo for a summit on the Zaire crisis, on Wednesday rejected sharing power with ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko's political party before elections.</p>
<p>Bizima Karaha, foreign policy strategist for rebel leader Laurent Kabila, told British Broadcasting Corporation radio in the Togolese capital Lome that power-sharing, proposed by Mobutu's party on Tuesday, was out of the question.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall never, never enter into any power-sharing with the government in Kinshasa. One thing for sure, we are not fighting for power-sharing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are fighting for democracy, we are fighting for freedom, we are fighting for human rights respect, we are fighting for the united country, we are fighting for a prosperous country, an end to their games which they have been using for more than 30 years.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about a specific proposal made by Mobutu's Popular Revolutionary Movement in Kinshasa for temporary power-sharing before elections, Karaha said:</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is not power-sharing. The problem is those people who have been killing our people. Those people do not want democracy, those people do not want freedom.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue is not power-sharing because you can have power-sharing today and the following day Zaire will still collapse. The problem is democracy, freedom, human rights respect. That's all that we want.&quot;</p>
<p>Karaha said the rebels had sent a delegation to Wednesday's Organisation of African Unity summit in Lome on Zaire because they were invited, but he said the delegation would not start negotiations with the government at the talks.</p>
<p>&quot;The only problem is that the people in Kinshasa did not have a mandate to negotiate. Secondly, they were not willing to negotiate. But I have just heard that this time maybe they are trying to be serious...,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;So we think that very soon we will start negotiations.&quot;</p>
<p>International pressure on the two sides to stop fighting has mounted sharply in the past week and was personified by the presence of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Lome.</p>
<p>Neither Mobutu, suffering from prostate cancer, nor Kabila was expected in Lome. But the prospect of a meeting between their delegations was taken seriously by diplomats.</p>
<p>Top French and U.S. officials were also in Lome.</p>
<p>South African President Nelson Mandela, criticised in the past for refusing the lead role in the continent's conflicts, has strongly backed efforts to bring peace in Zaire, sending envoys to both sides in the past week.</p>
<p>His vice-president, Thabo Mbeki, was to attend the Lome summit after apparently persuading Kabila to accept the principle of talks with Mobutu's top lieutenants instead of the 66-year-old leader himself.</p>
<p>The potential break-up of Africa's third biggest country, which Mobutu has ruled for more than three decades, is a nightmare diplomats want to avoid.</p>
<p>Congolese President Pascal Lissouba said in an interview published on Wednesday that an African peace force should be sent to Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;An African force must intervene in Zaire where Africa must play the main role (in bringing peace), even if the logistical support comes from outside the continent,&quot; he told the French daily newspaper Le Parisien.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 U.S., French and Belgian troops are massed in Congo, ready to evacuate Westerners from Zaire if necessary.</p>
<p>In theory, Kabila has little reason to stop fighting. His troops already control a quarter of the country.</p>
<p>They are moving steadily against Lubumbashi, capital of the southern province of Shaba whose vast reserves of copper, cobalt and precious metals have made Mobutu's elite super-rich.</p>
