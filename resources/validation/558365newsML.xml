<p>Britain's new finance minister Gordon Brown got some unwelcome advice on Sunday from his Conservative predecessor and a leading Labour left-winger -- both said his tough public spending plans were unachievable.</p>
<p>Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, who lost his job to Brown after Labour's landslide victory in last Thursday's election, said he did not believe Labour would manage to keep the lid on spending.</p>
<p>&quot;Gordon Brown promised he would deliver my public expenditure totals. I don't believe him,&quot; Clarke told BBC television. &quot;He may try, but I don't think the Labour government is capable of delivering my public expenditure totals.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That will be the first acid test of new Labour. My guess is they'll fall down on that and that will begin the process of change of economic policy.&quot;</p>
<p>Labour promised before the election not to increase income tax rates and to live within Clarke's public spending plans for the next two years.</p>
<p>These aim to keep spending growth to just 0.6 percent a year in real terms, a level not achieved for generations and regarded by many private economists as wildly optimistic.</p>
<p>Asked about suggestions that any Chancellor would have had to put up taxes to curb rampant consumer demand and bring down a budget deficit of around 23 billion pounds, Clarke replied:</p>
<p>&quot;Rubbish. We left healthy public finances. No-one has taken over a better inheritance in government as a chancellor since the war at least. Of course, keeping the burden of taxation as it is depends on controlling public expenditure.&quot;</p>
<p>Veteran Labour left-winger Ken Livingstone joined the fray from the opposite end of the political spectrum, predicting that Brown would ultimately have to raise corporate taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour made the correct pledge, which was to say we are not going to increase taxes on ordinary members of the public because they are already over-taxed,&quot; Livingstone, former leader of the now disbanded Greater London Council, told Sky Television.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the corporate sector that doesn't pull its weight in Britain compared with Europe. What we've got to do is make sure that this big tax increase falls on the corporate sector and in a way that encourages investment.&quot;</p>
<p>Livingstone said Brown faced a simple choice in trying to cool down an economy which the new chancellor has admitted shows signs of overheating -- raising interest rates or raising taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;We would be mad to jack up interest rates because that would make it much more difficult to get investment to create jobs,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been living beyond our means, we've doubled the national debt. That has to stop. I am arguing strongly -- and I think Gordon will almost certainly come down on this side at the end of the day -- for a substantial tax increase.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown has to make his first decision on interest rates by next Wednesday, when he is due to have his first monetary meeting with Bank of England Governor George.</p>
<p>George has been pressing since December for interest rates to be increased from the present 6.0 percent.</p>
<p>Raising rates could mean that the pound, already so strong against other currencies that British exporters are suffering, could increase further in value.</p>
<p>One of the last government's independent economic advisers said Brown should bite the bullet and raise taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel very strongly that the new government should tighten things up by raising taxes rather than interest rates,&quot; said Roger Bootle, chief economist at HSBC bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The level of the pound is damaging to business,&quot; he told the Mail on Sunday newspaper. &quot;We must get it down.&quot;</p>
