<p>A Sri Lankan opposition legislator was shot at by unknown gunmen but escaped unhurt on Wednesday as he campaigned for next month's local election, a party spokesman and police said.</p>
<p>Shots were fired at Gamini Athukorala, general secretary of the main opposition United National Party (UNP) as he was driving through a tea estate in Nivitigala, 90 km (60 miles) southeast of Colombo, UNP spokesman Saman Athaudahetti said.</p>
<p>&quot;(Athukorala) was attending several meetings in the area. While he was travelling to one, a tractor had blocked his path and then some shots were fired from the tea bushes,&quot; Athaudahetti told Reuters.</p>
<p>Athukorala, who is a member of parliament, reversed his vehicle and sped away, he said.</p>
<p>Police in Ratnapura confirmed the shooting and said Athukorala had lodged a complaint with police.</p>
<p>The shooting took place shortly after the UNP accused the government and police of turning a blind eye to attacks against its candidates ahead of next month's election.</p>
<p>More than 18,000 candidates from 12 political parties, including the ruling People's Alliance (PA), the UNP and 132 independent groups, will take part in the polls for 238 local government bodies, the Elections Department has said.</p>
