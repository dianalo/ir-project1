<p>The United States appears to have piqued the pride of some of its European guests at a summit of Group of Seven rich nations by lecturing them on everything from how to run their economies to helping Africa, delegates said on Saturday.</p>
<p>That, plus disagreements over enlargement of NATO and sustaining a peace-keeping force in Bosnia, left some delegates barely disguising their irritation at what they saw as steamrollering of the summit talks by the U.S. hosts.</p>
<p>&quot;The Americans were saying look how good we are and look how bad you are,&quot; one delegation source said of finance ministers' talks on Friday.</p>
<p>While the United States boasts the rich world's strongest economy and unemployment at a near 24-year low of 4.8 percent, Europe faces weak growth and unemployment up to 12 percent as it struggles to prepare for a single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>European Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy said the United States had pushed Europe hard on the need for structural reforms to bring down unemployment during talks with its G7 partners -- Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Europe, though gradually implementing structural reforms, has insisted that it wants to find its own way of running its economy rather than copy the American hire-and-fire style free labour markets.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not holding a competition for the best model,&quot; European Commission President Jacques Santer said. &quot;We define our own model.&quot;</p>
<p>As if the lecture on labour market reforms was not enough, a United States' initiative to help Africa by lowering trade barriers caused further irritation for Europe, which has long had closer ties with that continent.</p>
<p>French and European officials both produced figures showing that European aid levels to Africa were higher and tariff barriers lower than the Americans'.</p>
<p>The European Commission said European aid to Africa was seven times higher than that of the United States in 1995, while lower tariffs meant Europe imported almost twice as much from sub-Saharan Africa as its other G7 partners together.</p>
<p>&quot;The European Union is encouraging the G7 to do more not through grandiose initiatives but through improving Europe's own good record. I must say the record is a very good one,&quot; Santer told a news conference.</p>
<p>The atmosphere between Europe and the United States on political issues was also prickly at times.</p>
<p>France attacked the United States for refusing to change its stance against giving Romania early membership of the NATO military alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like this problem to be solved. We would do it more easily if the American position were different,&quot; a spokeswoman for French President Jacques Chirac said.</p>
<p>The United States has said that only Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic should be in the first wave of new NATO members.</p>
<p>Europe also disagreed with the United States over its determination to withdraw a peace-keeping force in Bosnia when its mandate expires. Withdrawing the force before conditions for lasting peace were in place, &quot;would pose problems for the Europeans,&quot; one source said.</p>
