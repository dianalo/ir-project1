<p>German grain prices for the newly harvested crop should at least remain steady in the near future, the Bonn farm ministry said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Farm minister Jochen Borchert said tight world grain markets and high demand in the European Union had pushed German levels above those seen a year ago -- despite harvest pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;There are good reasons to believe the market will stay firm but it would be too early to make recommendations as to marketing choices,&quot; he said at a harvest press conference.  </p>
<p>The ministry said ex-farm prices of wheat were 15-20 marks a tonne above last year's 224 marks level, but the future course was hard to gauge as qualities and volumes were diverse.</p>
<p>Farmers had relatively grown more quality wheat and this should secure them price premiums.</p>
<p>German fob wheat prices are in a 280-310 marks range once grain gatherers, traders and transport firms take their cut.</p>
<p>Rye farmgate prices were still 15 marks above last year's 205 marks but could decline amid quality problems, the ministry said.  </p>
<p>Rye suffered under rainfall in recent weeks and this reduced baking qualities measured in falling number tests.</p>
<p>Winter barley prices were pegged 10-20 marks above last year's 212 marks as volume expectations had to be trimmed.</p>
<p>Malting barley contracts had been fixed at 320 marks but free market prices were now 10-20 marks below that level.</p>
<p>Borchert said export activity in the upcoming season may be lower than in the one just finished because domestic stocks should no longer be wound down.</p>
<p>But a comfortable crop of 41 million tonnes, versus 39.9 million in 1995, would exceed immediate domestic demand.  </p>
<p>Some 20 million tonnes would go into feeding, of which two thirds would be directly fed on farm.</p>
<p>The ministry forecast a slightly higher industrial and nutritional grain usage and import demand in durum and maize.</p>
<p>If EU Commission approval for German exports was to be sought, the unpopular tax system should no longer be applied, Borchert said in response to questions.</p>
<p>&quot;We were opposed to the wheat export tax (in 95/96) and we would hope that it won't be repeated so that we would be able to participate in firm world market prices,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The EU today subsidised wheat exports for the first time in 15 months by paying a 3.9 Euc/tonne subsidy for 20,000 tonnes of wheat under preferential ACP programmes at a weekly tender.</p>
<p>The ministry also said Germany would widen its role as a net importer of rapeseed because its domestic crop would decline by a third to just two million tonnes this year, following winter damage.</p>
