<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/Index puts busy as market rallies.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-01-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Investors continued to pile into stock index put options Wednesday even as the market staged a solid recovery from recent lows.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the most active index option was the S&amp;P 100 index .OEX February 750 put, with volume of about 11,380 contracts. The option was down 2-5/8 at 12-3/8.</p>
<p>The most active OEX call was the February 750, with volume of roughly 4,345 contracts. That option rose 2-1/4 to 17-3/4.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a big discrepancy,&quot; said Harrison Roth, senior options strategist at Cowen &amp; Co.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot more puts than calls traded on a day when the market's up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Stock indexes rose to new day's highs in late trading. The underlying OEX was up 9.72 points, or 1.30 percent, at 758.40.</p>
<p>Among other indices, the S&amp;P 500 .SPX was ahead 7.48 points or 0.98 percent at 772.50.</p>
<p>The bellwether Dow industrial average was up more than 84 points or 1.27 percent at 6,740.</p>
<p>In the OEX overall, put volume outpaced call volume by 40,942 contracts to 37,751.  </p>
<p>Traders said some of the volume was probably came from investors attempting to take profits while others were buying the puts for protection, unconvinced that the market has shaken off its recent decline.</p>
<p>The pattern was similar in the SPX, where put volume topped call volume by 29,125 to 12,508.</p>
<p>One sign of investors' steady level of caution was the CBOE's volatility index .VIX, which remained in positive territory until late in the session.</p>
<p>Typically, the VIX declines sharply when the market rallies and rises sharply when the market declines.  </p>
<p>In late trade, the VIX was down 0.70 at 21.77, its low of the day. It had reached a session peak of 22.88. The index reflects implied volatilities for front-month OEX options.</p>
<p>Some analysts view a decline through the 20 level as key to any sustained market advance.</p>
