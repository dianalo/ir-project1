<title>USA: Burlington Resources sees lower H2 tax bill.</title>
<headline>Burlington Resources sees lower H2 tax bill.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Burlington Resources Inc told a conference call after its second quarter earnings that it expected to report a lower tax bill for the second half due to higher allowances.</p>
<p>Company vice president Jim Leahy said that the total tax credits for the year could be $80 million.  </p>
<p>The company also said that it would look at the San Juan Basin assets which are being sold by Amoco Corp.</p>
<p>Company president Bobby Shackouls said that although the company had around $500 million on its balance sheet, it had not yet seen any corporate acquisition or property acquisition which fitted its strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of money out there chasing assets, but there is not a lot which meets our criteria -- although we qould not hesitate to spend on properties or a corporate acquisition if we saw something that did,&quot; Shackouls said.  </p>
<p>He said that Burlington would continue to pursue its stock repurchase program.</p>
<p>During the quarter, it bought back 785,000 shares and since it started in 1988, the company has repurchased approximately 31 million shares or 21 percent of its original common stock capitalization.</p>
<p>Shackouls said that the company's capital program would probably be in the $700 million area for the year rather than the $650 million that had been budgeted.  </p>
<p>The company said that natural gas production would rise by 50 million cubic feet in the third quarter and oil production by 2,000 barrels, and production would rise by a similar amount in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>It said that it anticipated that the basis differential between San Juan Basin index natural gas and the NYMEX price would be 25-30 cents for the remainder of the year after 25 cents in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Changes in natural gas pipeline scheduling implemented by the Gas Industry Standards Board forced Burlington to shut in gas in the second quarter, but it expects this problem to be solved in the next 60 days.</p>
<p>&quot;We estimate that the problems associated with this cost us five cents on our second quarter netback and we predict that our index price will average about 35-40 cents less than closing NYMEX for the rest of 1997,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>The company said that industry-wide, excluding acquisitions, only 75 percent of gas production is being replaced, which should support natural gas prices. ((-- David Chance New York Newsroom 212 859 1902))</p>
