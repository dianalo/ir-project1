<p>Italian information technology group Olivetti said it would hold a news conference later on Monday for &quot;an important announcement&quot; widely expected to involve the sale of its loss-making personal computer division.</p>
<p>All Olivetti shares were suspended from trade on the Milan stock market for the day, a move Olivetti said it had requested in the light of the forthcoming announcement due at 1600 GMT.</p>
<p>The stock market has speculated for weeks that a deal to sell Olivetti's loss-making PC division was imminent and one Milan-based stock broker said: &quot;We are taking for granted that the announcement is going to be that. The only thing is the price. We don't have a range.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the last high-speed rumour I heard, people are saying it's one that's not going to make the market happy,&quot; he added, although another noted there were also rumours to the contrary.</p>
<p>Olivetti ordinary, savings and privileged shares were suspended shortly after the start of trade. The ordinary shares closed at 672.8 lire (43 cents) on Friday.</p>
<p>A consortium of investors, including U.S. financier Edward Gottesman of the London-based Centenary group and Gianmario Rossignolo, chairman of Electrolux unit Zanussi, have been in negotiations with Olivetti on buying the PC division.</p>
<p>Last week Gottesman's London-based legal firm Gottesman, Jones and Partners declined to comment on reports that he was interested in bidding for the troubled PC division.</p>
<p>But newspapers have cited sources close to Rossignolo as saying a deal is imminent and a source here also said last week negotiations with this consortium of investors were continuing and a deal was likely to be concluded in the coming days.</p>
<p>Reports have also said the consortium has agreed to pay 200 billion lire ($127 million) for the unit.</p>
<p>Another potential bidder tipped by Italian newspapers is U.S. corporate debt trader Gary Klesch, head of London-based Klesch and Co.</p>
<p>Olivetti chairman Roberto Colannino, who took over late last year, had said he wanted to sell the PC division by the end of 1996. International investment funds, which hold a large proportion of Olivetti stock, have urged the company for months to get rid of the PC business which has been badly squeezed in recent years by increasingly competitive market conditions.</p>
<p>Other rumours have swirled through the market in recent days that loss-making Olivetti is planning a more far-reaching restructuring than it has so far announced.</p>
