<headline>Nigerian oil exports hit by strike, not ethnic feud.</headline>

<p>Royal Dutch Shell Group's Nigerian unit said on Tuesday it had declared force majeure on exports of its prized Bonny crude oil because of a strike by contractors.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the striking workers said they were demanding to be paid off because the company they worked for had been sold.</p>
<p>He told Reuters by telephone from Port Harcourt in the southeast that the dispute began after Ocean Inchcape Limited (O.I.L) of Britain was sold to U.S.-based Tidewater Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;There are between 450-500 of us and some of us have been working for O.I.L. for more than 20 years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We were demanding 10 years salary as pay-off but after long negotiation we have come down to one year but the management has not agreed to pay,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>A Shell spokesman said exports of gasoline-rich Bonny light crude oil were suspended indefinitely from Monday because of the strike. O.I.L. handles the berthing and loading of tankers.</p>
<p>&quot;We have declared force majeure on Bonny exports with effect from yesterday,&quot; a Shell spokesman in Lagos said.</p>
<p>&quot;This action was taken in response to a strike by workers of a contractor that operates support services for tankers berthing and loading at Bonny terminal.&quot;</p>
<p>Shell's Bonny output is about half of the roughly 950,000 barrels per day (bpd) it produces in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Shell is the biggest oil operator in Nigeria, pumping roughly half the entire output of Africa's leading oil producer.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Dutch company was widely expected to be hit by running communal clashes in the oil-producing Warri area in its western operational sector but it said the crisis so far had only a slight impact on its activities.</p>
<p>Its spokesman denied reports in Nigerian newspapers on Tuesday that the communal conflict in Warri had forced Shell to cut output there by 15 percent. &quot;That is not true,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The reports quoted Shell's Western division general manager Joshua Udofia as telling reporters in the troubled oil-producing city of Warri, where the company has its divisional headquarters, that production was down by 15 percent and staff evacuated.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Udofia is in Lagos and has not spoken to any reporter,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said the situation in the western division remained as it was at the weekend when one flow station was shut down with the loss of about 2,000 bpd of crude.</p>
<p>The trouble in Warri is over the relocation of the local council headquarters from a town belonging to the Ijaw tribe to that of the Itsekiris.</p>
<p>Gangs of armed youths from both sides have been fighting running battles in the creeks and the city. An estimated 60 people have been killed since April 12.</p>
<p>The latest killings were on Monday, when eight people were killed in two areas of Warri sacked by rampaging youths.</p>
<p>Nigerian newspapers reported that Warri was tense with some youths wearing military uniforms terrorising residents.</p>
<p>At the root of the crisis in Warri area is a rivalry among three tribes -- the Ijaws, the Itsekiris and the Urhobos -- who are each seeking more say in the affairs of the oil town.</p>
