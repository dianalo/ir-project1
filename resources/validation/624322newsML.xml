<p>Somalia's two most powerful faction leaders, Hussein Aideed and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, agreed on Thursday to a ceasefire and called on other factions to join their peace efforts.</p>
<p>The arch-rivals made their pledge in a joint communique called the Cairo Joint Agreement after a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that followed two days of talks in the Egyptian capital.</p>
<p>The statement said the faction leaders also agreed to work together to achieve peace in Mogadishu and to abolish the Greenline, which separates the divided city into the north controlled by Ali Mahdi and the south by Aideed.</p>
<p>It is the third agreement by the faction leaders since Aideed succeeded his late father, warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed, who died in August last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The two leaders have agreed to solve the Somali problem in peaceful means and to cease all hostilities among the Somalis as from May 28, 1997,&quot; the joint communique said.</p>
<p>The statement also said Aideed and Ali Mahdi would &quot;exert the necessary efforts for holding the conference of national reconciliation to remove the remaining differences among the Somali people...inside the country in the coming months&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;All parties are to be invited to join the agreement which is aimed at achieving stability, security and unity all over the country,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Twenty-six Somali faction leaders agreed in Ethiopia in January to set up a National Salvation Council to establish a provisional government for Somalia.</p>
<p>But Aideed refused to attend the talks and denounced the agreement as Ethiopian meddling in Somali affairs.</p>
<p>Aideed and Ali Mahdi both lay claim to the presidency of the anarchic Horn of Africa nation. They agreed to a ceasefire after they held talks in Mogadishu earlier in January and after their two factions met in Nairobi in October 1996.</p>
<p>Somalia has been without central authority since 1991 after rebels overthrew late president Mohamed Siad Barre. The rebels soon turned against each other though, plunging Somalia into in factional fighting that killed thousands.</p>
<p>A U.S.-led United Nations intervention force of some 35,000 troops failed to restore law and order in Somalia and had to pull out after it got caught in battles with the late Aideed's forces in which U.S. servicemen were killed and captured.</p>
<p>Aideed, a 34-year-old former U.S. marine, was elected president of Somali by supporters and heads a government. But he has not received international recognition and is rejected by Ali Mahdi and other faction leaders.</p>
<p>Ali Mahdi claims to head the biggest clan network in Somali and counts on millionaire financier Hassan Ali Osman Atto among his allies.</p>
<p>&quot;As regards Mogadishu the two leaders agreed to work together to cease all hostilities, to achieve peace and stability in the capital city of Mogadishu and to abolish the so-called Greenline in the capital city and to unite the community,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Somalis have signed numerous peace accords since 1991 but none have managed to bring order to their country, one of the poorest in Africa.</p>
