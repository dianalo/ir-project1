<p>Thousands of people were evacuated from their homes on Sunday as heavy rain raised river levels in the Czech Republic and Poland, bringing more misery to regions where flooding has killed nearly 100 people.</p>
<p>CTK news agency quoted civil defence officials as saying nearly 9,000 people were evacuated as a precaution across the north-eastern Czech Republic, where emergency flood alerts were in force on several rivers.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is still very serious,&quot; Czech Environment Minister Jiri Skalicky told Czech Television.</p>
<p>Two villages close to the Polish border were flooded but there were no reports of further injuries and officials in both countries said the situation was not as bad as during the first, fatal deluge nearly two weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;For the time being, it is bad but there is no tragedy as far as rainfall is concerned,&quot; Poland's central crisis committee spokesman Krzysztof Pomes told Reuters. &quot;The lesson from the previous phase is that all are working to prevent another tragedy,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In Austria, shipping on the Danube, which flows from the Alps to the Black Sea, was suspended along a 90 km (55 mile) stretch between Linz and Krems, state television reported.</p>
<p>In Hungary, water levels rose steadily along the Danube and were expected to peak on Wednesday, without posing a threat to the capital Budapest.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Austria, flood waters retreated as clouds parted but emergency services remained on alert, with more showers forecast for Monday. The northern province of Upper Austria and the Danube basin have so far been most seriously hit by Austria's worst floods this century.</p>
<p>Hundreds of villagers were evacuated in the Czech Krkonose mountains, where the Labe (Elbe in German) rises. Others were being moved from their homes in the eastern Czech city of Ostrava, which was badly hit in the first wave.</p>
<p>Two villages were flooded close to the Polish border when the Stenava river burst its banks and an emergency flood alert was declared along the Morava river, CTK said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not just a flood, it is a real catastrophe,&quot; Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister Josef Lux told Czech Television.</p>
<p>He put the death toll at 46 and said more than 2,500 people had been injured. Lux said more than 500 villages and towns were hit, 10,000 people made homeless and 80,000 evacuated. He said 1,600 homes were destroyed and more than 10,000 damaged.</p>
<p>The Polish floods have killed at least 50 people, inundated a thousand towns and villages and swamped half a million hectares (1.25 million acres) of land in the south and west. Poland's crisis committee chief Zbigniew Sobotka told a news conference that levels in the Odra (Oder) -- the major river flowing north along the German border which previously turned deadly and swamped towns and cities -- were generally lower than before.</p>
<p>&quot;Smaller mountain rivers...are overflowing onto certain areas but the wave on the main rivers, on the Odra and the Wisla, is not a dangerous one which could bring devastation like the previous floods,&quot; Sobotka said.</p>
<p>Krzysztof Szamalek, a deputy environment minister on the crisis committee, said the rains were expected to lighten during the rest of Sunday and ease off on Monday, while forecasts for the rest of the week were optimistic.</p>
<p>Sobotka said the greatest risks now faced the Jelenia Gora, Legnica and Walbrzych provinces in the southwest, where rain overnight was significant.</p>
<p>Officials are talking about losses of billions of zlotys.</p>
<p>Townspeople were busy building flood defences in Jelenia Gora and around the Silesian towns of Raciborz and Legnica, where streets in the outskirts were already flooded on Sunday.</p>
<p>In Klodzko on the Czech border, residents who had already lost homes, businesses and farms, watched the rain with dread.</p>
<p>&quot;We're scared of this constant rain because it could mean the water will reach us again,&quot; said small-holder Krystyna Sobanska, whose uninsured crops were ruined and house is in danger of collapse.</p>
<p>The Polish government, accused by the opposition of doing too little too late, was flinging resources and personnel, including around 45,000 troops and 80 helicopters, into relief and rescue efforts.</p>
<p>A special government body set up to combat the effects of the disaster promised to have a draft plan ready by Tuesday.</p>
<p>In eastern Germany, the Oder river, which rises in the Czech Republic as the Odra, reached its highest level for 50 years in Frankfurt on the Oder. Matthias Platzeck, the regional government's environment minister, said the water was putting huge pressure on dykes, weakened by heavy rain.</p>
<p>The rain has also caused high water in the southern state of Bavaria, where a group of 18 potholers was reported missing.</p>
