<p>Football star Tony Adams's reported confession to his Arsenal team mates of his drink problem marks the latest incident in a career marked by sporting achievement and personal scandals.</p>
<p>Within five months of joining Arsenal, at the age of 17, Adams made his first team debut at Highbury.</p>
<p>At 21, he was offered the captaincy by then Arsenal manager George Graham, making him the club's youngest captain.</p>
<p>Since then he has lifted more silverware than any previous Arsenal skipper, including the 1987 and 1993 League Cups; 1989 and 1990 league championships; 1993 F.A. Cup; and 1994 European Cup Winners' Cup.</p>
<p>Adams's England debut came at the age of 20, an impressive one against Spain, leading then manager Bobby Robson to compare him hastily with Bobby Moore.</p>
<p>His reputation took a battering a year later at the European championship finals when Marco Van Basten turned him every which way in scoring a hat-trick for Holland.</p>
<p>Angry fans began taunting him with donkey noises, a taunt that was periodically surfaced throughout his career.</p>
<p>He was subsequently omitted from the World Cup squad of 1990 and was imprisoned the following Christmas for four months for reckless driving after being three times over the alcohol limit.</p>
<p>Restored to England colours by Graham Taylor, he was found wanting in a match against Ireland and another exile followed.</p>
<p>But his club form remained consistent and he became an automatic choice under Terry Venables, who made him captain after David Platt was demoted.</p>
<p>Adams, winner of 45 England caps, led an England side that captured the nation's hearts with their progress to the semifinals of Euro 96 before losing a penalty shoot-out with Germany.</p>
<p>But the player has made several appearances in newspapers because of the low-points in his career -- starting with his drink-driving conviction.</p>
<p>He hit the headlines again in 1993 when he needed 29 stitches to a head wound after falling down stairs at a nightclub.</p>
<p>Later that year he was involved with team mate Ray Parlour in an incident at an Essex pizza restaurant when customers were sprayed with a fire extinguisher.</p>
<p>This year -- on Cup Final day -- he was reported to have gone on a 16-hour pub crawl, ending up on stage with a stripper.</p>
<p>Only last week there were fresh reports of disharmony in his Essex household, with Adams and his wife Jane, 30, on the verge of splitting.</p>
<p>The star and his wife have three children. The couple met in a pub and married in July 1992.</p>
