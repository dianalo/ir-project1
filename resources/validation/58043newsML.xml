<p>Ukrainian leaders breathed a sigh of relief on Tuesday as the two-week transition period for the introduction of the new hryvnia currency came to an end with a minimum of problems.</p>
<p>At one minute past midnight on Tuesday the old karbovanets officially ceased to be legal tender and the hryvnia, the name of the currency used during the Kievan Rus empire 1,000 years ago, took over.</p>
<p>&quot;It went smoothly. It went better than we expected,&quot; Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Pynzenyk said on television as the transition period neared its end.</p>
<p>Pynzenyk, together with central bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko, announced the decision to introduce the hryvnia -- after several delays -- at last month's fifth anniversary celebrations of Ukrainian independence.</p>
<p>Public fears of an immediate plunge in its value failed to materialise. The hryvnia has been unchanged on the Ukraine Interbank Currency Exchange at 1.76 to the dollar since its September 2 debut.</p>
<p>&quot;We had the old money, now we have new money,&quot; said a cafeteria worker in Kiev, typical of Ukrainians' matter-of-fact attitude towards the change.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say it was fairly successful,&quot; said a Western economist. &quot;There was no currency confiscation, no panic, and consumers didn't lose confidence. The change is good psychologically. People no longer have zero fatigue.&quot;</p>
<p>One hryvnia was valued at 100,000 karbovanets -- an interim currency launched in 1992 at parity to the Russian rouble in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Better known as the coupon, the karbovanets sank in value as hyperinflation took hold in Ukraine and fetched about 32 per rouble before the new currency was introduced. Worthless small denominations were recycled to make toilet paper.</p>
<p>Some economists had said the two-week period to pull the old karbovanets out of circulation was too short.</p>
<p>With some 8.7 trillion karbovanets ($48 million) of 330 trillion karbovanets ($1.8 billion) still unaccounted for, the government has announced that banks will continue to exchange the karbovanets for hryvnia until October 16.</p>
<p>The newspaper Molod Ukrainy published an opinion poll showing 56 percent of those surveyed believe the hryvnia would herald economic progress, compared with 23 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>At markets, many customers reverted to calling the currency the rouble, the Soviet-era name, now that several zeroes had been knocked off transactions with new unwrinkled bank notes.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just habit,&quot; said one seller.</p>
<p>Ukraine had repeatedly promised to introduce the hryvnia as a &quot;permanent currency&quot; since independence in 1991 but had to postpone it because of economic instability.</p>
