<p>The world's biggest public relations and communications firm, Burson-Marsteller, has completed a worldwide, organisation restructuring that has brought pain, but has also paid off, a top executive said.</p>
<p>The changes are paying off by improving the firm's use of resources and making clients happier, Ferdinand de Bakker, European chief executive officer of Burson-Marsteller, told Reuters in a recent interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We changed from geographic profit centres to looking at clients as profit centres,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The restructuring, first implemented in Burson-Marsteller's U.S. offices before being introduced in the firm's other offices around the world early this year, was designed to &quot;shake things up, to prevent (us) from becoming bureaucratic,&quot; de Bakker, a Dutchman, said in his London office.</p>
<p>&quot;Our clients have been very pleased and impressed with the results,&quot; he said, noting that research by an independent company showed client satisfaction improving.</p>
<p>Although clients have no interest in how Burson-Marsteller structures its own affairs, they are keenly interested in how the firm handles client demands, he said.</p>
<p>The restructuring allowed the firm, which is owned by the private U.S.-based Young &amp; Rubicam advertising agency, to focus its resources on clients rather than on internal management.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind the organisational change was: &quot;Let's not have our best people, our most senior people, run offices and manage people. Let's have them manage clients,&quot; de Bakker said.</p>
<p>But even for a firm that is in the business of helping clients adapt to changing environments, adjusting to change internally did not come easily.</p>
<p>&quot;For many years we've been helping our clients implement change,&quot; said de Bakker. &quot;We always thought this was not a big deal -- until it happens to you.&quot;</p>
<p>Burson-Marsteller learned that change of such wide magnitude &quot;takes longer than you think it will,&quot; and there is a constant need to repeat to staff the message about the reasons for change, de Bakker said. Although the restructuring has involved disadvantages along with the advantages, overall it has been positive.</p>
<p>And while Burson-Marsteller found the change more difficult than expected, de Bakker emphasised that in other ways the firm has been continually changing and evolving.</p>
<p>Over the years, Burson-Marsteller has repositioned itself from public relations to public affairs, to counseling and communications, before finally moving on perception management.</p>
<p>&quot;We help our clients manage the perceptions of their stakeholders,&quot; de Bakker said. Perceptions frequently fail to keep up with reality, allowing Burson-Marsteller to work with clients to put across a clear image to the public.</p>
<p>Last year British newspapers were filled with articles that criticised so-called &quot;spin doctors&quot; in the public relations business when then-prime minister John Major made a public relations executive and an advertising expert lords.</p>
<p>Peter Gummer, head of Shandwick public relations agency, and Maurice Saatchi, the advertising guru -- who had both advised Major -- were made life peers. The move prompted one opposition politician to label the two &quot;Lord of the Lies&quot;.</p>
<p>But de Bakker insisted the staff of Burson-Marsteller were not &quot;spin doctors.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think people in the communications business or the public relations business ought to say things that are not true,&quot; he said. &quot;That is not something we would ever do. We would lose our credibility instantly if we ever did that.&quot;</p>
<p>Instead, he said, Burson-Marsteller gets clients to examine their own actions and images and then help them develop strategies.</p>
<p>&quot;What we often do with clients is hold a mirror in front of them and say, Look at what you're doing,&quot; de Bakker said. &quot;Our clients don't hire us to say, Don't change.&quot;</p>
