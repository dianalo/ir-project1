<p>Estonia's Privatisation Agency on Thursday released the sale details for a 51 percent state-owned slice of Estonian Metal Export Ltd (EMEX), saying the rest of the company would be sold by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>The state will be left with a 44 percent slice of the company after this sale as a five percent holding was sold through a public offering last November/December.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to find a single buyer or a consortium to buy this 51 percent stake,&quot; the agency's director general Vaino Sarnet told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to find a strategic owner for this 51 percent. We consider this to be quite a good investment as it is a stable business.</p>
<p>&quot;The other 44 percent will then be sold through a public offering in Estonia later in the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Bids for the 51 percent sale have to be received by May 8.</p>
<p>EMEX, with 207 staff, buys scrap metal in Estonia and Russia, processes it and then exports it to various markets including Germany, Britain, and Sweden.</p>
<p>Its turnover in 1996 was 301.7 million kroons and in 1995 386.1 million kroons with a pre-tax profit of 52.84 million kroons and net profit of 40.87 million kroons.</p>
<p>In 1995 EMEX bought a total of 219.6 million tonnes of ferrous scrap metal and 12 million tonnes of non-ferrous scrap metal. This was expected to have decreased by 10-15 percent in 1996 and slip further.</p>
<p>&quot;Substantial increase in turnover and number of employees of EMEX can only take place by processing scrap metal coming from outside Estonia, primarily Russia,&quot; the agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;So far the obstacle has been the export policy exercised by Russia and Lativa which includes high export customs for scrap metal and metal waste.&quot;</p>
<p>The company also owns three long-haul trucks which are mainly used to transport materials to Finland and several properties around Estonia.</p>
<p>The privatisation of EMEX is part of Estonia's ongoing programme established after the country regained independence in 1991 to privatise state owned businesses.</p>
