<p>Pakistani forward dollar rates surged to record highs on Wednesday amid reports of heavy withdrawals from foreign exchange accounts prompted by economic jitters putting pressure on the rupee, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Record forward rates for the dollar amid an unprecedented shortage of the U.S. currency in the market suggest that banks see the rupee weakening further in the coming months,&quot; forex dealer Salman Arshad of ABN Amro Bank told Reuters.</p>
<p>Dealers said offers for six-month forward dollars opened at 40.70 rupees on Wednesday in the interbank forex market against Tuesday's closing rate of 40.50 rupees and Monday's 40.15.</p>
<p>Forward rates have been rising since the State (central) Bank of Pakistan (SBP) devalued the rupee 3.79 percent against the dollar on September 10, they said.</p>
<p>The six-month forward rate for the dollar was 39.25 rupees before the devaluation, a premium of about 5.6 percent. Within a week it had risen to around 40 rupees, Arshad said.</p>
<p>Breaking a pattern of gradual downward adjustments, the SBP cut its rate sharply on September 10 to 36.9700/37.1549 to the dollar from 35.6200/35.7981 fixed on August 29.</p>
<p>&quot;The devaluation should have been enough to reduce the differential between the official and unofficial dollar rates, but the market doesn't seem to agree,&quot; a Western economist said.</p>
<p>The devaluation sparked rumours -- officially denied -- that the government might freeze foreign currency deposits to help boost its depleting foreign reserves, which stood at $2.34 billion in August against $2.82 billion in August 1995.</p>
<p>Individuals, not trusting central bank denials, have since pulled about $200 million from forex bank accounts, bankers say.</p>
<p>&quot;The historically sharp rise in the premium on forward dollar buying indicates that the market is not only short of dollars but has lost confidence in the rupee,&quot; Arshad said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the erosion of the rupee, which has lost 5.31 percent of its dollar value since July 1 and 7.95 percent since January 1, had weakened the confidence of importers who are heavily buying forward dollars to hedge their positions.</p>
<p>A foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said the market was anticipating a further loss of up to four percent in the rupee's value against the dollar by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Dealers said economic worries had intensified after Moody's Investors Service Inc put Pakistan's credit ratings under review on Monday for possible downgrading.</p>
<p>Moody's said it may cut Pakistan's B1 long-term foreign currency rating and its B2 sovereign ceiling for foreign currency deposits. Pakistan's B1-rated foreign currency bonds and notes were also placed on review for possible downgrade.</p>
<p>It voiced concern at &quot;Pakistan's weakening macroeconomic fundamentals, as evidenced by the deviations from longstanding goals of economic restructuring, as well as increased levels of short-term debt and ongoing balance of payments difficulties.&quot;</p>
<p>The chief dealer at one brokerage house said Pakistan faced loan repayments of around $700 million in October and had an average monthly trade deficit of $250 million.</p>
<p>&quot;What will be the reserves positions after the October loan payments if the International Monetary Fund (IMF) refuses to release the suspended standby facility?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>Pakistani officials have taken undisclosed new proposals to Washington this week to try to convince the IMF to reactivate the $600 million standby loan, stalled for the past six months.</p>
<p>The dealer said only a positive outcome of the Washington visit could prevent the crisis from worsening.</p>
