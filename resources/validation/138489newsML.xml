<p>Cambodia commemorated the fifth anniversary of a U.N.-brokered peace pact on Wednesday amid stepped up efforts to end years of conflict with Khmer Rouge guerrillas.</p>
<p>Thousands of children, soldiers and civil servants joined the country's top leaders, foreign dignitaries and senior monks in front of the royal palace at a ceremony laced with pomp, speeches and classical dance.</p>
<p>The celebration climaxed when co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, parliament chief Chea Sim and senior guests released doves over the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;This event has celebrated a new era of peace, reconciliation and development,&quot; Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi told Reuters.</p>
<p>His Lao counterpart Somsavat Lengsavad said: &quot;The last five years have seen peace coming back to Cambodia.&quot;</p>
<p>Their two countries were among 18 nations that signed the October 23, 1991, Paris peace accords along with the four main warring Cambodian factions, including the Khmer Rouge.</p>
<p>This led to the dispatch of a $2 billion U.N. peace-keeping mission to Cambodia and to polls in 1993 that produced a coalition government, marking the country's emergence from two decades of turmoil and bloodshed.</p>
<p>The general elections were boycotted by the Khmer Rouge after the guerrillas reneged on the pact, however. They have since fought a low-level war with coalition government troops.</p>
<p>A split within the Khmer Rouge last August raised hopes that at last a total cessation of fighting in Cambodia was possible. However, analysts say it also risks polarising the political scene with rival parties seeking the loyalty of different rebel factions.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Hun Sen held unprecedented talks with breakaway Khmer Rouge leader Ieng Sary, who split with hardliners loyal to guerrilla chief Pol Pot and has been discussing a merger of his force of up to 4,000 guerrillas with the government.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge was responsible for the deaths of more than one million Cambodians during their infamous 1975-79 &quot;Killing Fields&quot; rule.</p>
<p>Political analysts say a coalition rivalry could unravel the peace efforts, noting that the two premiers are not appearing united towards the breakaway faction.</p>
<p>The coalition partners have also started focusing on elections scheduled for 1998, they said.</p>
<p>Tensions surfaced in March when Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party threatened to quit the government unless the formerly communist Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of Hun Sen ceded more power to his party. This prompted Hun Sen to warn that he would use force to prevent a breakup of the government.</p>
<p>A semblance of government solidarity returned soon after Ieng Sary, foreign minister during the Khmer Rouge regime, broke with the Maoist hardliners.</p>
<p>But attempts at one-upmanship in dealing with the breakaway faction have since emerged.</p>
<p>Ranariddh said on Tuesday only one premier should emerge from the 1998 elections.</p>
<p>Hun Sen agrees there should be a single prime minister, a concept enshrined in the constitution but not yet writ in law, but disagrees with Ranariddh about the need for international monitors during the polls and insists the coalition should remain into the next century.</p>
<p>&quot;Did the (1993) election achieve stability and peace? I would say not yet, because of the two-headed government. They need another election to solve this problem,&quot; said a diplomat.</p>
