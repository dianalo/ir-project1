<p>Brazil's Central Bank expects to see steady improvement in the public sector's fiscal health during 1997, said Altamir Lopes, head of the bank's economics department.</p>
<p>Lopes told reporters that the accounts of all parts of the public sector had showed a &quot;tendency to recover&quot; in the second half of 1996 and that this trend should continue.</p>
<p>&quot;The picture started off a bit foggy, but in the second half began to show a tendency to recover,&quot; he said after announcing the public sector operational deficit was an unexpectedly low 3.89 percent of GDP last year.  </p>
<p>&quot;The expectation is that this trend of improvement will continue,&quot; Lopes added.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that some states and municipalities had withheld 13th month salary payments until early 1997.</p>
<p>This may have contributed to a reduction in the states and cities' primary deficit to 0.57 percent of GDP in December from 0.69 percent of GDP in November. In 1995, the states and municipalities posted a primary deficit of 0.17 percent.</p>
<p>Lopes said some states had carried out extensive voluntary redundancy programs which had carried high one-off costs.</p>
