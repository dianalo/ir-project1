<headline>Asian crude firmer, prompt overhang of Oman.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-05-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Asian crude prices were firmer on Monday, supported by a global futures rally, with regional crudes finding support.</p>
<p>July trading has not yet started for Middle East crudes, but July Oman was expected to start trading at MPM -5/-10 cents per barrel, compared to the MPM -20/-25 cents done for June.</p>
<p>Oman demand is seen increasing in July, as the 3Q term price of Yemeni Masila is expected to rise, making Oman more attractive to buyers. But there is still an overhang in the prompt Oman market, with a U.S. major heard to have sold a May cargo of Oman at MPM -50 cents to South Africa.  </p>
<p>The major was showing May Oman volumes in the market last week, volumes that it had initially planned to sell to the U.S.. Regional crude trading was quiet, with Minas talked steady at ICP +0.30 cents, in line with the last trades done.</p>
<p>But Duri levels continued to firm on increased demand from fuel oil blenders.</p>
<p>Indonesian affiliates who were heard to be looking to buy spot supplies to compensate for the tighter allocations released by Indonesia for June.</p>
<p>Some sellers said they saw potential buying interest for Duri at ICP +0.10.  </p>
<p>But the sellers were not showing any firm offer price yet.</p>
<p>On light grades, only an end June Cossack was heard available, offered by a major in Australia.</p>
<p>Other traders are already looking towards July trading, but waiting for a firmer indication of demand before showing offer levels.</p>
<p>India has tendered to buy one million barrels of July crude. The tender closes May 27 and offers should be valid until May 29, traders said.</p>
