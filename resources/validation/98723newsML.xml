<title>USA: Palestinian statehood said stymied by Israel.</title>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has proposed that Palestinians accept as a permanent solution a dramatic reduction in their aspiration for statehood, The New Yorker reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>The weekly news magazine's Connie Bruck said Netanyahu in an interview on the eve of his first meeting with Arafat on Sept. 4 suggested the terms he might offer Palestinians.</p>
<p>&quot;I propose a different solution: that we have, if you will, a very generous autonomy in which there basically are self-governing authorities, with the exception of certain sovereign powers, which remain with, if you will, the parent, the sovereign country -- which specifically include security, control of borders, control of airspace and so on. And everything else is theirs,&quot; Netanyahu said.</p>
<p>&quot;What Netanyahu had outlined was a radical dwarfing of the Palestinian aspiration,&quot; Bruck said in her article.</p>
<p>&quot;Netanyahu was essentially proposing that the Palestinians accept as a permament solution the dramatic reduction in their national ambitions which Arafat had grudgingly accepted only as an interim compromise in Olso,&quot; the New Yorker said.</p>
<p>In her article Bruck detailed how the Middle East peace pact was forged in Oslo in 1993 and said Israelis wrung concession after concession from the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Only in the months after the signing did PLO leader Yasser Arafat, who had believed that the agreement opened the door to eventual Palestinian statehood, come to realise how limited the agreement was Bruck said.</p>
<p>&quot;Arafat had not read the agreement,&quot; she quoted one of the participants to the Olso talks as saying. &quot;He'd read the headings and his people gave him a rosier interpretation.&quot;</p>
<p>The New Yorker article appeared as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in the Gaza Strip attempted Sunday to breathe life to the faltering peace process following clashes between Israelis and Palestinians in which more than 70 people died.</p>
<p>She said one striking feature of the Oslo peace process was the number of times the participants came to the brink of calling it quits, only to find a way of going forward at the last minute.</p>
