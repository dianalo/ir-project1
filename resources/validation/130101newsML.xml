<p>Top South African police officers on Monday named apartheid president P.W. Botha as having personally ordered dirty tricks and cast doubt on claims by his successor F.W. de Klerk that his hands were clean.</p>
<p>Retired police commissioner General Johan van der Merwe told the amnesty committee of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission:</p>
<p>&quot;During 1988 I received an instruction from Mr Adriaan Vlok, then minister of law and order... that the building known as Khotso House was to be damaged by explosives to such an extent that it could no longer be utilised. According to Mr Vlok this instruction had come from President P.W. Botha personally.&quot;</p>
<p>Van der Merwe said the Johannesburg building, headquarters of the South African Council of Churches, was an office for Nelson Mandela's then-banned African National Congress (ANC). No one was killed in the blast.</p>
<p>The testimony marked the first direct implication of Botha in apartheid dirty tricks before the country's truth commission, but he and de Klerk -- the only surviving apartheid presidents -- have been named by a senior police officer on trial for murder.</p>
<p>Van der Merwe was subpoenaed to give evidence at Monday's amnesty hearing for five secret police officers who have broken ranks to expose apartheid-era murders of black activists.</p>
<p>They want to be pardoned in return for telling all about 40 state-sponsored murders and bombings carried out to prop up white rule.</p>
<p>The highest-ranking of the five is retired brigadier Jack Cronje, who commanded an infamous hit-squad unit near Pretoria in the early 1980s. He and another one of the five face trial in connection with over two dozen murders.</p>
<p>The group said in their submission they doubted claims of innocence to the truth commission by de Klerk, whose National Party is now the biggest opposition group.</p>
<p>&quot;We call upon the previous government and our superiors to explain certain orders given to us about which we shall testify and to admit to authorising actions outside the normal processes of the law,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We seriously doubt the statement made by Mr F.W. de Klerk ...in the National Party submission to this commission.&quot;</p>
<p>De Klerk said in his submission in August that &quot;I have never been part of any decision...authorising or instructing the commission of such gross violations of human rights.&quot;</p>
<p>The ANC said van der Merwe's evidence vindicated the party's view that covert actions against black activists were sanctioned at the highest level. &quot;This suggests the submission ... by de Klerk in many instances fell short of the whole truth.&quot;</p>
<p>In separate commission hearings in Cape Town, South Africa's current defence chief acknowledged that files were destroyed in the last years of apartheid to protect agents after the end of minority rule.</p>
<p>&quot;In the view of not creating ill-feeling among the people of South Africa and also to protect lives, in the run-up to the elections, certain documents were destroyed that reflected names of agents and names of people that supplied information,&quot; General Georg Meiring said.</p>
<p>Alex Boraine, deputy chairman of the truth commission, told a news conference he was disappointed and angered by the defence force report.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt that the presentation was breathtakingly one-sided and really almost audacious in its total neglect of any culpability by the defence force whatsoever,&quot; Boraine said.</p>
<p>&quot;This flies in the face of the facts as we have heard them over many years and many months.&quot;</p>
