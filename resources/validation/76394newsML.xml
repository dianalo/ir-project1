<headline>Widespread Palestinian protests over tunnel.</headline>
<dateline>JERUSALEM 1996-09-25</dateline>

<p>Hundreds of Palestinians protested in Jerusalem and throughout the West Bank and Gaza on Wednesday against Israel's opening of a tourist tunnel near an Islamic shrine in the city holy to Moslems and Jews.</p>
<p>In one clash on the outskirts of Jerusalem, hospital officials said police firing rubber bullets and using teargas wounded seven Palestinians during a stone-throwing demonstration by 500 students from Bir Zeit University near Ramallah.</p>
<p>Israeli police said the Palestinian mufti of Jerusalem was lightly wounded in the head by an empty bottle apparently intended for Israeli security forces during a separate protest near the Via Dolorosa of walled Old Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Youths also scuffled with police outside the Damascus Gate entrance to Old Jerusalem, where merchants closed their shops on orders from the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>The Palestinian minister of Islamic Affairs, Hassan Tahboub, was hurt during a protest outside the gate, said Sheikh Mohammed Hussein, the director of al-Aqsa mosque. Hussein said Tahboub was pushed to the ground by a policeman on horseback.</p>
<p>Palestinians said residents from Jenin and Nablus, in the northern part of the West Bank, to Hebron in the south took part in demonstrations called by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority in protest at the tunnel.</p>
<p>Police prevented Palestinians from carrying out the main protest planned for Wednesday -- a march from the Damascus Gate to al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest site built on the traditional site of the ancient Jewish Temple mount.</p>
<p>The tunnel was dug out several years ago along the Wailing Wall which abuts the Temple Mount. Workmen on Tuesday opened a second entrance to the tunnel, igniting Palestinian charges that Israel was violating the religious status quo in the city.</p>
<p>Witnesses said about 500 students hurled stones and bottles at Israeli troops in Hebron in the West Bank. No one was hurt.</p>
<p>An Israeli handover of parts of Hebron to the Palestinian Authority has been held up by Israeli security fears. Some 400 Jews live in a fortress-like enclave in the heart of the city, home to 100,000 Arabs.</p>
<p>Thousands of students took part in a protest meeting called during a two-hour cancellation of classes at al-Najah university in Nablus, a city under Palestinian self-rule since late last year, witnesses said.</p>
<p>In Jenin, also under self-rule, shops closed about 2,000 Palestinians took part in a peaceful demonstration, chanting: &quot;No peace without Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;Jerusalem is the capital of our state&quot;.</p>
<p>In Jericho in the West Bank, also under self-rule, Palestinians burned Israeli flags and pictures of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, witnesses said.</p>
<p>In self-ruled Gaza, hundreds of Palestinians took part in demonstrations burning Israeli flags and chanting anti-Israeli slogans.</p>
