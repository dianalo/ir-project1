<p>Coffee consumers could start switching to lower-quality coffees if this week's agreement to extend producers' export limits continues to fuel already soaring prices, a consumer spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;In the light of tight supply and the concern of the effect of high prices on consumption, then of course this (agreement) is unexpected,&quot; said Walter Bastiaanse, head of the Dutch delegation attending London talks being held by the International Coffee Organization (ICO).</p>
<p>&quot;Consumers will certainly notice and they will first change to lower-quality coffee -- and then of course reduce consumption,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>The Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC), anxious to defend prices after the present buying fever abates, ended its own London talks on Wednesday with an accord to limit total exports by its 14 members to 52.75 million 60-kg bags for the 12 months from July 1.</p>
<p>The volume is roughly the same as that set under current curbs expiring on June 30.</p>
<p>&quot;They (producers) are still talking about retention...when you have indications that supply in the market is already tight,&quot; Bastiaanse said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are concerned that consumption will drop. This is another factor -- but still they keep their retention scheme,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The ACPC deal was struck against the backdrop of a rally that has taken benchmark futures prices for green (unroasted) beans up by 80-100 percent since January.</p>
<p>The price is strong because of low stocks and tight Latin American supplies in the approach to the season when Brazil, the biggest exporter, is at risk from frosts.</p>
<p>But the ACPC made clear that it did not want high prices to quench consumer demand for coffee, so it made provision to juggle supply within the one-year limit in line with fluctuating demand.</p>
<p>Bastiaanse said he felt the ICO, which had no economic brief, should distance itself from ACPC decisions relating to price.</p>
<p>&quot;The producers have a separate organisation -- let's keep it separate. Let's keep the ICO away from market intervention.&quot;</p>
<p>The ICO's council, consisting of 62 member countries, started its meeting on Thursday morning but has now split for separate group discussions.</p>
<p>The council, which is the ICO's policy-making body, is set to continue its meeting on Friday.</p>
