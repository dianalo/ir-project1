<p>Shares in London and Frankfurt took a severe beating on Friday as investors pocketed profits from their record-breaking markets and raised questions over the future of the recent bull run.</p>
<p>On the currency markets, the dollar lost two pfennigs as traders feared an increase in German interest rates. The greenback also slipped against the yen despite concern that turmoil in Southeast Asian currencies would hurt the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>London, the continent's biggest bourse, fell 2.5 percent by 125.5  points to close at 4,865.8, the biggest percentage drop since October 1992 when Britain pulled out of the European exchange rate mechanism.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's computerised IBIS index plunged over three percent.</p>
<p>On a day when most European markets were closed for the Assumption holiday, the nose-dive took most traders by surprise.</p>
<p>The slide was triggered by opening losses of 1.25 percent on Wall Street because of weakness in the bond market and earnings woes.</p>
<p>Market sentiment, which has cooled markedly in recent days, turned distinctly chilly following the optimistic run that has powered shares to record levels on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>London's decline was led by falls in the banking and oil sectors. Banks, the engine behind much of the market's boom, sliced 40 points off the FTSE 100 index. Heavyweight HSBC Holdings was among the biggest losers, tumbling 169p to 2165p at the close.</p>
<p>In contrast, the FTSE 250 index which incorporates mid-sized manufacturers and has recently underperformed blue chips, ended up 8.3 points at 4,698.2.</p>
<p>&quot;People are looking to switch out of the main line and into the second line stocks,&quot; said Brian O'Donnell, sales trader at Schroders.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, stocks were dealt a fiercer battering as sliding futures, the weakening dollar and Wall Street's dramatic drop pushed the computerised IBIS index down by 127.89 points to 4067.64 before recovering slightly at the close.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people are running for cover out there at the moment. This is very quickly done -- it's a bit of a fast correction -- but just look at how the future has fallen,&quot; one Frankfurt trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Volumes are thin out there, but the momentum is strong,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Currency markets also had a hectic day. The dollar fell to 1.8212 marks compared with Thursday's closing levels of 1.8417, squeezed by fears that the German central bank was prepared to raise rates.</p>
<p>Thin trading, with many European markets shut for the Assumption holiday, exaggerated movements.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar had been on a downward trend all day, and when some big sellers came into the market as the U.S. opened, it accelerated,&quot; said Peter von Maydell, currency strategist at UBS.</p>
<p>Comments on Thursday from Bundesbank vice president Johann Wilhelm Gaddum were behind the latest bout of currency jitters.</p>
<p>Gaddum was quoted in a German newspaper as saying the Bundesbank was concerned about rising consumer inflation and would keep its options open regarding possible shifts to variable-rate repo tenders.</p>
<p>&quot;The Gaddum comments seem to be giving a very strong hint that the Bundesbank is prepared to raise interest rates if they have to, and that's fuelling gains for the deutschemark,&quot; said Malpede.</p>
<p>The dollar also lost some of its early gains on the yen in the wake of receding Japanese rate rise expectations and ebbing concern about the impact of the South East Asian FX crisis on Japanese economy.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 1.8212 marks and 117.51 yen, compared with 1.8417 and 117.85 in late European trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index ended down 125.5 points at 4,865.8.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The DAX index closed down 78.57 points at 4,152.86. The computerised IBIS index finished down 117.94 points at 4077.59.</p>
<p>PARIS - Closed.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold closed at  $324.35 an ounce, compared to Thursday's close of $326.25. Silver was down six cents at $4.44 in late trade.</p>
