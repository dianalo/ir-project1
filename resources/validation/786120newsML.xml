<headline>EU says seeks &quot;satisfactory compromise&quot; on VW aid.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-08-07</dateline>

<p>The European Commission said on Thursday it continued to try to reach a &quot;satisfactory compromise&quot; with Germany over controversial subsidies to car giant Volkswagen in eastern Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking at all sorts of scenarios which I can't comment on,&quot; said Commission spokeswoman Sarah Lambert in response to questions.</p>
<p>However, she said there were various open and interconnected points which needed to be solved, adding: &quot;As any ultimate solution, we need to see satisfaction on all those elements.&quot;</p>
<p>Lambert described a German newspaper report saying that the European Union executive and Bonn were close to a compromise as &quot;slightly premature&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to see a solution but of course it would depend very much on the German authorities,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>At issue is some 540 million marks ($285 million) of Saxony state subsidies which the Commission cleared VW to receive in June 1996.</p>
<p>The figure was 241 million marks less than VW and Saxony had originally agreed upon. The subsidy was contested by the Commission as anti-competitive and an unfair advantage for the German firm.</p>
<p>But rather than paying out only the 540 million marks, Saxony granted VW a 631 million mark investment, leaving VW with 91 million marks more than the Commission had agreed. The funds are now in a bank account.</p>
<p>Lambert said the Commission stood firm on its demand that the money should be reimbursed.</p>
<p>VW has earlier suggested that it step up investment in order to offset the additional state subsidies.</p>
<p>The Commission has become increasingly worried that public subsidies may have gone out of control in Germany, even if it accepts that industrial restructuring in areas previously under communist rule is a costly and lengthy process.</p>
