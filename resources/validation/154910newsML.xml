<p>A former French defence minister, the late Charles Hernu, was an agent of the Soviet Union and other east bloc countries in the 1950s and 1960s, a French magazine said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Charles Hernu was an agent of the East,&quot; the weekly L'Express said. Hernu, defence minister from 1981 to 1985 under Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, died in 1990 at the age of 66.</p>
<p>The magazine said Hernu was first recruited as a rising political star by a Bulgarian spy in Paris in 1953, and was paid by Bulgaria, Romania and the Soviet Union for at least a decade for supplying reports about French politics.</p>
<p>L'Express said Mitterrand was told in 1992 by French DST counter-intelligence chief Jacques Fournet of the payments. Mitterrand ordered the scandal covered up as a state secret.</p>
<p>Mitterrand, a personal friend of Hernu, left power in May 1995 and died last January. L'Express said later governments were also told of Hernu's past and chose to keep quiet.</p>
<p>The magazine said a record of the payments to Hernu, known by the codenames of &quot;Andre&quot; or &quot;Dinu&quot;, was handed to France by an east bloc country after the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p>L'Express said it was unknown whether Hernu had acted for Moscow and its satellites after he became defence minister.</p>
<p>&quot;Still today, the question is open: did the Russians play this secret weapon against Charles Hernu after 1981? The answer is still buried in the most secret archives of the KGB,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It said the Romanian secret service considered contacting Hernu after drawing up a report in 1982 on his past for late dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu. The plan was dropped as too risky.</p>
<p>L'Express said Hernu had been paid monthly sums of several thousand francs (hundreds of dollars) for his work, including portraits of politicians like Mitterrand. And in 1958 he accepted the equivalent of 300,000 francs ($60,000) to fund an election campaign to parliament. Hernu lost despite the cash.</p>
<p>Hernu resigned in disgrace from the defence ministry in 1985 after French agents sank the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in Auckland harbour, New Zealand, as the vessel was preparing to protest against French nuclear testing in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>Hernu's son Patrice said he would ask President Jacques Chirac to investigate the charges, saying he found it impossible to believe his father had been a Moscow puppet when in office.</p>
<p>He noted that as defence minister, Hernu was criticised for his warmth towards the Washington and coolness towards Moscow, for instance by backing deployment of U.S. nuclear missiles in Europe to counter Soviet SS-20 missiles in the east.</p>
<p>Yves Bonnet, head of the DST services in 1982-85, also said he had seen no hint that Hernu was pro-Moscow. Hernu had also persuaded the Socialists in the 1970s of a need to develop an independent nuclear force.</p>
<p>&quot;I can say that nothing in his behaviour, dealing with a number of delicate issues that affected our security in relation to the Soviet Union, justifies such an allegation,&quot; Bonnet Told LCI television.</p>
<p>Alain Johannes, an analyst for LCI, said the report, if confirmed, could tarnish both Mitterrand's reputation and that of the secret services who were apparently unaware of Hernu's contacts with the east bloc for 30 years.</p>
