<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan money rates close slightly up on NCD issue.</title>

<p>Taiwan's money rates finished slightly higher on Monday as the central bank's issue of T$5 billion negotiable certificates of deposit tightened liquidity, dealers said.</p>
<p>The overnight interbank rate ended at 5.921 percent against Saturday's 5.838 close -- somewhat outside the central bank's target zone of 5.00-5.5 percent -- with 30-day commercial paper up to 5.80 percent against 5.70-5.75.  </p>
<p>Dealers said liquidity in the banking system would remain relatively loose in the near term as some T$13 billion worth of NCDs were due to mature later in the week and funds that flowed out of the banking system were gradually returning.</p>
<p>The central bank is expected to issue more NCDs to mop up funds, they added.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year 86/4 bond yield fell to a three-month low in earlier session. Dealers said the government bond market likely would attract more interest after Monday's dramatic 3.72 percent stock-market plunge.</p>
