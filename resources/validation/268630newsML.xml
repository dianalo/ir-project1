<p>Thai rice prices edged on tight supplies and active deliveries ahead of the year-end, trade sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Millers slowed down milling as paddy prices shot up, resulting in tighter supplies while exporters sped up loading. More than 100,000 tonnes were needed between now and the end of the year, the trade sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>The prices of benchmark 100 percent B grade rose to around $325-355 per tonne FOB Bangkok from $305-350 last week.</p>
<p>The 100 percent fragrant rice also edged up to $615-620 per tonne on the same basis from around $615 a week earlier.</p>
<p>Some traders were keenly awaiting the result of Iraqi rice tender of about 60,000 tonnes although many believed chances of Thailand beating competitive sales by Vietnam and Pakistan were slim.</p>
<p>Another major factor in the market was the possibility of government-to-government purchases of Thai grain by the Philippines.</p>
<p>A senior commerce ministry official said the country, which was expected to import 300,000-500,000 tonnes of rice in 1997, had shown interest in buying Thai rice.</p>
<p>An official sale team will return from Manila on Thursday.</p>
<p>Commerce ministry officials planned several trips between now and February to major Thai rice importing nations to sell rice, partly to prevent fresh supplies from pressuring local prices.</p>
<p>The ministry intended to buy up to one million tonnes of rice from farmers to cover 1997 government-to-government deals.</p>
<p>Forecasts that Thailand's rice exports for 1997 will remain bullish and the setting of a five million tonnes exports target for Thai rice, despite an anticipated increase in global output, lifted the market mood.</p>
<p>The official attributed the strong export outlook to possible lower rice exports from India and the delayed harvest in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Asia is expected to remain the major market for Thailand, especially China which is the biggest buyer of Thai rice so far this year.</p>
<p>China bought 539,087 tonnes of Thai rice out of 4.7 million tonnes shipped during January-November.</p>
<p>Thailand expects to produce 21.259 million tonnes of rice for 1996/97 (April-March) season from 22.015 million tonnes the previous season. --Bangkok Newsroom - (662) 652-0642</p>
