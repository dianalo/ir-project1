<p>Euro offerings accounted for five percent of the international bond market in the first six months of the year, according to Capital DATA Bondware.</p>
<p>First-half figures showed 55 deals worth $20 billion were launched. The bonds, launched in eight European Union currencies including the Ecu, all contain clauses which allow their redenomination into euros after economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>There are two goals for these euro offerings, bankers said. One is to broaden a borrower's investor base, the other to have large, liquid benchmark bonds in place for the advent of EMU.</p>
<p>The euro bond market after EMU is launched in 1999 will be based on credit differentiation as currency risk disappears and will contain many borrowers previously confined largely to domestic markets.</p>
<p>These issuers, who will be small fish in a large pool after EMU, instead of vice-versa, have begun issuing euro bonds to broaden their investor base.</p>
<p>&quot;Issuance in prospective euro currencies is the best game in town. It sharpens name recognition,&quot; European Bank for Reconstruction and Development executive director Kari Nars said recently.</p>
<p>To achieve liquidity, several borrowers have issued euro-tributary, or parallel, bonds.</p>
<p>These are launched in more than one EU currency but with the same coupon and maturity date. They contain clauses allowing for their fungibility after being redenominated.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan, the pioneer lead manager, said this produced &quot;super liquid&quot; transactions &quot;because of their size and the pan-European dimension&quot;.</p>
<p>The European Investment Bank has led the way in euro-tributary financings. It has a February 2007 issue with five feeder issues in escudos, francs, guilders, lire and marks worth a combined 2.3 billion Ecu ($2.6 billion).</p>
<p>The EIB, an arm of the EU, has said it is keen to ensure there can be no questioning of the liquidity of its paper after EMU.</p>
<p>The third stage of EMU, including the introduction of the European Union's planned single currency, the euro, is prescribed by EU law to take place no later than January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>From that date, all national currencies within the euro area will cease to exist legally.</p>
<p>Some deals which can be redenominated in euros have been launched in currencies not expected to be in the first wave of euro nations. Most notable was the EIB's offering of a 500 million pound ($832 million) December 2007 bond in mid-April.</p>
