<title>MEXICO: Mexico '97 soybean plantings higher than last year.</title>
<headline>Mexico '97 soybean plantings higher than last year.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-05-26</dateline>

<p>Mexican farmers planted more soybeans this year than last, with between 35,000 to 40,000 hectares sown in southern Tamaulipas, United Soybean Board and American Soybean Association said in a report obtained Monday.</p>
<p>It originally estimated around 10,000 hecatres were to be sown in Mexico's traditional growing zone of the northeastern state.</p>
<p>&quot;After checking around some of the major soybean producing areas in Mexico, there are some changes to the original projections for soybean acreage this year. Reports from the southern Tamaulipas area now confirm that they expect acreage to be about 35,000-40,0000 hectares,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Last year, Mexico planted around 10,000 hectares, largely in southern Tamaulipas.</p>
<p>&quot;This year, most farmers had originally planned to plant sorghum again. However, with the crop in tnhe northern part of the state (Tamaulipas) so abundant, farmers are deciding to plant soybeans instead of sorghum and corn,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;That decision has come in the last two or three weeks. They expect the price of sorghum to drop and suppolies to be at very high levels so it will be better for them to go back to soybeans,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It added that ground moisture levels also have made farmers look at soybeans again. For the past three cycles, much of Mexico's northern region was shrouded in a drought.</p>
<p>&quot;The weather has been much better up to now as there is some moisture in the soil and the prognosis is that there will be good rains and good overall weather this year. All these facts favor soybeans over sorghum and corn,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>If 40,000 hecatres are planted in southern Tamaulipas it will mean a harvest of around 60,000 tonnes, or aboutr 2.5 percent of the total amount of soybeans imported last year, it added.</p>
<p>It said there are also likely to be plantings in the southern state of Chiapas. It gave no details. Plantings in the states of Sinaloa and Sonora are expected to be negligible because of white fly disease and limited water supplies.</p>
