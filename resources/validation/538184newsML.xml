<p>Minuteman International Inc, which reported lower first quarter earnings, said its outlook for the remainder of 1997 remains strong.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook for the remainder of the year appears to be strong, despite continuing investments in our long-term strategies, as we introduce additional products and further expand into international markets,&quot; Jerome Rau, president, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Minuteman, which makes commercial and industrial vacuums, floor and carpet care equipment, and cleaning and coating products, reported first quarter net income of $0.21 a share. A year ago it earned $0.30 a share after an $0.08 gain from the sale of a former manufacturing facility.</p>
<p>Operating profits were down 7.2 percent due in part to costs associated with promotional efforts, investments to establish its Multi-Clean line of chemical cleaning products as a separate division, and by absorbing some supplier price increases and higher group insurance premiums.</p>
<p>Sales rose 9.8 percent to a record $14.1 million in the quarter, from $12.8 milllion a year ago. Minuteman said demand was particularly strong in North America, aided by promotions that were aimed at capturing additional market share.</p>
