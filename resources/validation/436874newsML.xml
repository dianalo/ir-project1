<p>Angry young British designer Alexander McQueen, enfant terrible of catwalk shock tactics, let rip at the staid house of Givenchy with a hard-core ready-to-wear show on Wednesday.</p>
<p>After his first controversial couture show for the staid label was panned by the French papers in January, McQueen seems to have found a working formula that somehow makes his violent fashion sense compatible with his new job.</p>
<p>McQueen took old man Givenchy's staple ingredients and gave them his own salty modern twist, creating a high-speed, sexually charged spectacle set in a disused horse market.</p>
<p>He did it by fashioning leather -- palomino, emerald or violet -- into sexy bustier dresses punched full of holes, dyeing snakeskin lavender for floor-length coats and tailored jackets and, in an ultimate calculation, even put Kate Moss in a Bettina blouse of sheer black lace.</p>
<p>The result was often vulgar and aggressive, for the hard-hearted street-walker rather than the matronly society hostess.</p>
<p>And while panther print fur minis, fishnet stockings and stiletto-heeled vinyl boots may not be what Givenchy's ladylike clients were hoping for, McQueen didn't forget them.</p>
<p>That's why the show featured plenty of tame grey or pinstriped trouser suits, albeit with pointy power shoulders, close-to-the-body dresses reminiscent of the 1950s that were sensual but in good taste, and a beige evening ensemble of chiffon that swirled delicately about the knees.</p>
<p>&quot;It shows there are two sides of Alexander: superb tailoring and master creation on a women, and the other side is just crazy,&quot; said Joan Burstein, owner of Brown's in Britain.</p>
<p>McQueen hits out at his critics in an interview in the current issue of Newsweek magazine, comparing them to Hitler.</p>
<p>&quot;My clothes are out there on a limb and I get slagged for it,&quot; he said. &quot;It's like Hitler and the Holocaust. He destroyed millions of people because he didn't understand. That's what a lot of people have done to me because they don't understand what I do.&quot;</p>
<p>Many fashion insiders shrugged the statement off as typical McQueen provocation.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of violence in his collections, but a lot of energy too, and I think people are disturbed by it,&quot; said Nicole Fischelis of Saks Fifth Avenue. &quot;I like what he does intellectually, but I think he likes to create controversy.&quot;</p>
<p>At Chanel, German designer Karl Lagerfeld resuscitated Coco Chanel's dalliance with Russia in Kandinsky motif embroidery on slim black evening wear, a blue coat with red Cossack embroidery and the pale, translucent make-up of flapper girls.</p>
<p>There were oversized wool coats for severe Russian winters and soft, cropped, nubby tweed jackets over wide boyish trousers that the grand old lady might have worn herself.</p>
<p>Then Lagerfeld zoomed decades forward to sexy black or navy suits with the heavy shoulders of power dressing, short pleated skirts and stiletto heels.</p>
<p>&quot;It seemed to be a very eclectic collection. He represented both the soft and sporty clothes and also very strict tailoring in the suits and dresses. There was something for everyone,&quot; said Dawn Mello, president of Bergdorf Goodman department store.</p>
<p>Power-dressing is catching on in a big way this season.</p>
<p>Brazilian designer Ocimar Versolato showed it in his hard-edged, square-shouldered zip-up dresses that recall designer Claude Montana, one of the initiators of the genre.</p>
<p>Hemlines, when they were not at the instep, were high on the thigh, especially on a fringed, single-sleeved black cocktail number and a bridal mini of lace petals.</p>
<p>But Versolato's forte is his evening wear, where he put to use his skilled hand at draping. That meant undulating black velvet skirts beneath off-the-shoulder knit bodices, or plum chiffon veiling a bubblegum pink satin brassiere and skirt.</p>
