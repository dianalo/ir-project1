<text>
<p>Indonesian palm olein prices were stable in late trading on Tuesday after early falls, with buying interest staying thin, traders said.</p>
<p>They said palm olein was quoted at 1,430-35 rupiah/kg in Jakarta, unchanged from the opening, but trades were also heard at 1,425 rupiah.</p>
<p>&quot;The market turned quiet following reports of violence during the election campaigning in Jakarta,&quot; one trader said. &quot;I heard some players outside Jakarta closed early for the day, while many in the city were showing no interest in buying.&quot;  </p>
<p>Police fired tear gas to break up confrontations between supporters of the ruling Golkar party and minority United Development Party (PPP) in east Jakarta. Police also fired tear gas to disperse crowds in the Warung Buncit area in the south. There were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests.</p>
<p>The traders said the market was expected to remain sluggish on Wednesday in view of a holiday in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Data from Belawan Port showed that the MT Istana-V will leave the North Sumatran port on Wednesday for Semarang in Central Java with 2,000 tonnes of palm olein.</p>
