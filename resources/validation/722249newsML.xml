<p>China has released two dissidents jailed for their role in 1989 pro-democracy protests after an appeals court quashed their convictions, a Hong Kong human rights group said on Friday.</p>
<p>Tang Yuanjuan and Li Wei from China's northeastern Jilin province were released on Monday from a prison in neighbouring Liaoning province and arrived home the next day, the Information Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.</p>
<p>Tang and Li, former employees of the First Automobile Works, were arrested in June 1989 and charged with counter-revolutionary incitement and belonging to a counter-revolutionary group, it said.</p>
<p>The convictions were part of a crackdown that followed the crushing by the army of pro-democracy protests centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>Tang, 39, had suffered from hepatitis and tuberculosis while in prison and had broken a rib while being beaten, the centre said.</p>
<p>Tang had been sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and Li to 13 years, but in May this year the Jilin Higher People's Court overturned the judgment and reduced their sentences, it said.</p>
<p>On May 29, the court decided Tang, Li and two other dissidents, Leng Wanbao and Li Zhongming, had not aimed to overthrow the government and dropped the charges of belonging to a counter-revolutionary group, it said.</p>
<p>Tang and Li Wei remained convicted of the other charge, but their sentences were reduced to eight years each, it said.</p>
<p>Li Zhongming was cleared of all charges, while Leng had his sentence cut to five years from eight and was paroled in 1994, it said.</p>
<p>Court officials and the dissidents could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The human rights group said it was the first time a Chinese court had overturned sentences meted out to activists involved in the 1989 demonstrations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prominent dissident Bao Ge said on Friday he was suing the labour camp where he was held for three years without trial.</p>
<p>He told Reuters the Shanghai Number One Labour Camp had violated his human rights and broken Chinese law by illegally confining him and restricting his right to write letters, receive visitors and vote.</p>
<p>Bao, 33, was released from three years of &quot;education through labour,&quot; a form of administrative detention that does not require a trial, on June 4, the eighth anniversary of China's 1989 crackdown.</p>
