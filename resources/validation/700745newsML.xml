<p>Southeast Asia's rapidly growing mega-cities are choking in poisonous clouds of vehicle exhaust as increasingly affluent populations invest in cars and motorbikes, but governments are now moving to curb the problem.</p>
<p>In downtown Jakarta, a swirling cloud of black exhaust fumes that chokes cyclists and pedestrians trails a battered mini-bus as it gathers speed after picking up passengers.</p>
<p>Around the corner, a three-wheeled motorised ricksaw crammed with office workers belches dark smoke as it sputters along narrow alleys, playing its part as a vital link in the transportation chain.</p>
<p>As elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Indonesian cities are being suffocated by exhaust emission from steadily-growing traffic thanks to rising per capita income in the world's fourth most populous nation of 200 million people.</p>
<p>Mines and Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana has ordered a phasing out of leaded gasoline by 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;The public should start modifying their cars,&quot; he said at a recent vehicle emission test.</p>
<p>The teeming capital of Jakarta, home to some 10 million people, had some 1.8 million registered vehicles in 1996 with the number growing by 1.4 percent a year.</p>
<p>In a bid to reduce air pollution, the government launched a &quot;Blue Sky&quot; programme earlier this year, which included spot checks on vehicles.</p>
<p>Although Indonesia does not have a schedule for the use of catalytic converters, steps are being taken to reduce air pollution, including switching government cars from petrol to natural gas. No deadline has been set.</p>
<p>BANGKOK FINDS SOME RELIEF IN LEAD-FREE GASOLINE</p>
<p>Thailand, whose capital, Bangkok, is one of the world's most polluted cities, has also acted.</p>
<p>Suwaporn Sirikoon, policy and planning analyst at the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO), said the government had decreed that all petrol sold in Thailand must be lead-free by early 1997.</p>
<p>In fact suppliers began selling lead-free regular and super petrol from the middle of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The introduction of lead-free gasoline in Thailand is faster than several countries in Asia,&quot; said Suwaporn.</p>
<p>&quot;Car pollution in Thailand used to be very bad before the introduction of lead-free gasoline. Now the situation has improved quite a lot,&quot; said a senior official at the Commerce Ministry's Fuel Oil Division.</p>
<p>He said catalytic converters had been used on new cars since July 1994. But vehicles running on diesel oil were not yet equipped with converters.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commerce Ministry, in its bid to control car pollution, now permits high-speed diesel oil to contain sulphur at a level not exceeding 0.25 percent by weight. The sulphur content must be reduced to 0.05 percent by weight from 1999 onwards,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Two grades of unleaded gasoline are available in Thailand. One includes a chemical substance called soft-valve seat protection and is used in old cars. The second does not have the substance and is used in new vehicles, he added.</p>
<p>MALAYSIA AIMS TO BE LEAD-FREE IN 10 YEARS</p>
<p>Malaysian officials said that, although Kuala Lumpur is one of Asia's most traffic-congested cities, catalytic converter use was very low and leaded gasoline was not expected to be phased out completely for another decade.</p>
<p>But they said they believed air pollution in the Malaysian capital was still under control.</p>
<p>Although Malaysia has been actively promoting the use of catalytic converters since the early 1990s through the domestically manufactured Proton cars, the devices have not really caught on with motorists.</p>
<p>With a substantial cost of 1,000 ringgit ($400) or more involved in installing catalytic converters, only about 10 percent of new cars are sold with them, auto industry officials said.</p>
<p>The Malaysian Motor Traders Association said 275,615 cars were sold in 1996, an increase of 22.5 percent over 1995.</p>
<p>Leaded gasoline is still sold alongside unleaded fuel in gas stations throughout Malaysia, but officials said the government aims to have almost all vehicles on the road powered by unleaded gasoline within the next decade.</p>
<p>&quot;Motorists need to be more conscious of the environment and the need to stop polluting the atmosphere with lead,&quot; said an official at the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment.</p>
<p>But some Malaysian drivers cling to the belief that unleaded fuel lacks the octane levels of conventional gasoline and is, therefore, not suitable for high-performance cars.</p>
