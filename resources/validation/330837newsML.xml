<text>
<p>Former Miami Commissioner Miller Dawkins was sentenced Friday to 27 months jail on federal bribery and conspiracy charges -- part of a corruption scandal that reached the top levels of the city's management.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger ordered Dawkins to serve two years supervised release on top of the 27 months behind bars. He must also repay the balance of $20,000 of the $30,000 he received in bribes.</p>
<p>Dawkins told the judge he was sorry for his actions and asked for forgiveness.</p>
<p>Roettger ordered him to begin the sentence on June 3, allowing him to seek treatment for an eye problem. Dawkins will remain free on bond until then.</p>
<p>Dawkins, 71, could have faced up to 15 years in prison and fines of up to $500,000 under a plea agreement, though sentencing guidelines called for no more than 30 months.</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty last October to charges that he took $100,000 in bribes that were purportedly from a computer company, and conspired to accept $100,000 more.</p>
<p>Dawkins admitted he conspired with former city finance director Manohar Surana to solicit kickbacks from Unisys Corp, which was negotiating a $20 million computer contract with the city in March 1995.</p>
<p>Unisys reported the kickback demand to the FBI and helped investigators set up a sting that resulted in Dawkins' arrest.</p>
<p>Surana, who has agreed to plead guilty to unspecified charges, began cooperating with the FBI in March and recorded conversations implicating Dawkins.</p>
<p>Dawkins was also videotaped as he acepted one payment, a paper bag containing $25,000 in cash, in the parking lot of a Denny's restaurant.</p>
<p>He voted twice to approve the Unisys contract, which was unanimously approved by the city commission. Because of his conviction, Dawkins is barred from further elected office.</p>
<p>Law enforcers' &quot;Operation Greenspan&quot; against city hall corruption also led to the downfall of former city manager Cesar Odio, who denies corruption and bribery charges and will fight them in court.</p>
<p>In the wake of the scandal it emerged that the City of Miami had a budget deficit of $68 million and it has been placed under the watch of a state-appointed oversight board.</p>
<p>Dawkin's disgrace also robbed Miami's black population of its traditional seat on the city commission. A Cuban American, Humberto Hernandez, won the the election for his seat, leaving blacks without a voice on the commission for the first time in three decades.</p>
