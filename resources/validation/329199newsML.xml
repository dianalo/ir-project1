<p>Australian wheat futures firmed in continued quiet trading on Thursday despite Chicago's fall on Wednesday, with the Australian Wheat Board's (AWB) pool price still the key to the market.</p>
<p>Only the near-term March 1997 contract traded, rising by A$4.00 to A$169.00 a tonne in five trades near the close.</p>
<p>Settlement prices (the mid-point between bid and ask quotes) rose by about A$3.00 a tonne for nearer-term contracts.</p>
<p>Ben Suttie, of C.A &amp; L Bell Commodities Corp Pty Ltd, said slow futures trading reflected a cash market which was held up by the AWB.  </p>
<p>Futures spreads were very wide, with differences of A$15.00-A$20.00 a tonne between bid and ask quotes.</p>
<p>Sellers were not interested because bids were seen as low, although bids (for example A$165.00 on March 1997 and A$150.00 on September 1997) were where the market should be, he said.</p>
<p>It was unclear when the AWB would close off its pool.</p>
<p>The board, which this week raised the pool price by A$3.00 to A$188.00 a tonne, owned the lion's share of Australia's 23 million tonne crop and closure of the pool should cause domestic prices to fall, Suttie said.  </p>
<p>The AWB might keep the pool open for as long as possible, while keeping exports rolling, he said.</p>
<p>The general perception was that the last seven to 10 million tonnes of wheat might be hard to export, he said.</p>
<p>Australian domestic prices were at a significant premium to U.S. wheat now that Chicago had come off, he said.</p>
