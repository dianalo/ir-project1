<p>Colombia's central government budget deficit is set to rise to about 5 percent of gross domestic product in 1998, while the consolidated public sector fiscal  deficit grows to 3 percent of GDP, a central bank director forecast Monday.</p>
<p>Salomon Kalmanovitz, one of the bank's seven top officials, coupled his gloomy prediction with a call to the government to fight harder to balance the budget.</p>
<p>Last year the central government deficit was running at 4.1 percent of GDP while the consolidated public sector deficit, excluding privatizations, was about 2 percent of GDP.  </p>
<p>&quot;The government must cut the fiscal deficit by reining in all costs that don't boost production,&quot; Kalmanovitz told a forum entitled &quot;How to Reactivate the Economy&quot;, hosted by the El Tiempo newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;The adjustment must be made over a three to four year period by financing the deficit with more domestic loans and less foreign credit,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Kalmanovitz's comments coincided with the latest report issued by investment analysts Santander Investment. It forecast central government deficit would grow to 5.4 percent of GDP in 1997 against the backdrop of declining tax revenues because of the on-going recession. It said the deficit would remain above 5 percent in 1998.  </p>
<p>&quot;Given sluggish growth, we expect tax revenues as a percentage of GDP to fall. Efforts to pare back spending have basically fallen on the investment budget, which should decline from 1996 levels while we expect current spending to continue well ahead of inflation,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;The deficit is also being exacerbated by the growing interest burden and we forecast a federal deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP this year,&quot; it concluded.</p>
<p>In his speech to the forum, Kalmanovitz said his deficit forecast could even be superseded if the government did not cut its preliminary net foreign income estimates.  </p>
<p>Colombia is scheduled to take on $1.7 billion in new foreign debt this year, less than the $2.1 billion originally estimated, but the figure is set to rise to $2 billion in 1998.</p>
<p>At the same time, Kalmanovitz said total income from oil exports was likely to be about $4.5 billion in 1998. He estimated the government would earn $1.5 billion from its on-going privatization program this year and a further $600 million next year just from the sale of state coal mining company Carbocol.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very important for the government to take a hard look at foreign debt forecasts for next year and for all state entities to cut back their forecasts,&quot; he said.</p>
