<p>Fresenius AG, a German health care group, said on Tuesday it expected sales and profits to grow by at least 10 percent this year, fuelled largely by more acquisitions and innovative products.</p>
<p>&quot;Developments at Fresenius this year remain positive despite increasingly difficult conditions, and we expect sales to climb at least 10 percent and earnings to climb even more strongly,&quot; chairman Gerd Krick told a news conference.</p>
<p>Results at Fresenius Medical Care, the world's largest dialysis company in which Fresenius AG holds a majority stake, should grow at a similar pace, Krick predicted.</p>
<p>The Bad Homburg-based company also announced a 45 percent rise in net profit to 132 million marks ($77 million) on 1996 group sales of 3.6 billion marks, up 63 percent for the year.</p>
<p>Sales at Fresenius Medical Care, a separate company listed on the New York bourse that reports its results in dollars, stood at $1.5 billion with net profit of $88 million.</p>
<p>These numbers reflect the totals posted by the group which was created last October when Fresenius AG merged its core dialysis business with National Medical Care, which it acquired from U.S. group W.R. Grace last year.</p>
<p>Had Fresenius Medical Care been operating for the entire year, Krick said the group's sales would have climbed by seven percent to $3.053 billion with net profits, including $34 million in extraordinary costs, of $44 million.</p>
<p>The strong results, fuelled mostly by international growth with over one third coming from North America, allowed the parent company to raise its dividend by 30 pfennings each for common stock and preference shares, raising them to 1.80 marks and 1.90 marks respectively.</p>
<p>The upbeat outlook also fuelled stock market gains where Fresenius preference shares climbed nearly one percent to 363.50 marks in late bourse trade. Fresenius Medical Care however fell 2.50 marks to 149.70 marks in bourse trade.</p>
<p>Analysts cautioned that Fresenius's plan to raise capital by a nominal 10 million marks with a one-for-nine rights issue, announced late on Monday, could weigh on share prices in the future.</p>
<p>The new cash, which analysts estimated could total around 700 million marks, is already earmarked for acquisitions, Krick said, explaining Fresenius AG planned to spend around 800 million marks on takeovers and investments this year.</p>
<p>The lion's share, some 500 million marks, would be spent by Fresenius Medical Care, Krick added.</p>
<p>Underscoring the group's aggressive takeover policy, Krick said: &quot;We want to be some place where the market is set to grow before everyone else is there.&quot;</p>
<p>Fresh from acquiring U.S. group Neomedica's dialysis business earlier this year, Krick said Fresenius Medical Care remained underrepresented on the west coast and in the Great Lakes region of the United States. &quot;So this is definitely where we want to expand,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>By the year 2000, Krick predicted there would be some one million dialysis patients but only five key players in the market, down from the 15 currently vying for market share.</p>
<p>Fresenius is also eager to expand in southeast Asia where it expects strong growth in coming years.</p>
<p>Besides Fresenius's crown jewel dialysis business, the group is active in the hospital-home care business, pharmaceuticals business, project and service business and others.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals, posting 835 million marks turnover last year, is the second biggest unit after dialysis, and is the area where Fresenius expects to present many more innovative products. This includes a method whereby fat can be sucked out of blood, the only treatment currently known for people suffering from excessively high blood-fat contents.</p>
<p>To boost earnings Fresenius also plans some major restructuring, especially in its homecare unit, which caters to patients requiring serious medical care at home. ($ = 1.715 German Marks)</p>
