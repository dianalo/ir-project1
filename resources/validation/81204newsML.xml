<headline>Yeltsin working on documents in hospital - spokesman.</headline>

<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin, following strict doctors' orders, is spending two or three hours a day on paperwork, press spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;He has a work schedule of two or three hours a day,&quot; Yastrzhembsky told a news conference.</p>
<p>Doctors said on Wednesday that Yeltsin, 65, was fit enough for a heart operation, but that surgery would be postponed for at least six weeks. The operation -- a relatively routine bypass operation -- will improve the blood supply to Yeltsin's heart.</p>
<p>The president has been in the Central Clinical Hospital since September 13 and doctors expect him to stay there until the operation.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky said little had changed since doctors spoke to journalists on Wednesday. &quot;For now he is in the Central Clinical Hospital. You have heard everything, there has been no lack of information, nothing essentially new has happened since then.</p>
<p>Yeltsin had two heart attacks last year and doctors say he may have had another one between the two rounds of Russia's presidential election</p>
