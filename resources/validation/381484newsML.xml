<headline>RAPID - COMMISSION APPROVES CONCENTRATION IN PAPER SECTOR.</headline>
<text>
<p>EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESS RELEASE: IP/97/123</p>
<p>DOCUMENT DATE: FEBRUARY 17, 1996</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The Commission approves the acquisition by KNP group of two</p>
<p>paper merchants in Germany and Italy</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The European Commission has decided to approve a concentration by which the Dutch paper and packaging company NV Koninklijke KNP BT (&quot;KNP BT&quot;) acquires from UK's Bunzl group two graphic paper distribution subsidiaries, being the German Wilhelm Seiler GmbH and the Italian Bunzl Italia SpA. The Commission found that KNP BT's increasing market position both in Italy and Germany is not likely to result in a dominant position on those markets, since other distributors as well as paper producers will ensure sufficient competition.</p>
<p>On both the German and Italian market there are a number of other distributors having significant market shares, being Igepa, SchneidersIhne, Papier Union and Classen in Germany and AWA and Burgo in Italy. Also, both effective and potential competition comes from paper producers' direct sales on the market. Therefore, although the concentration leads to KNP BT being one of the major players in both countries, the Commission considered that it will not result into the creation or strengthening of a dominant position.</p>
<p>KNP BT is one of the leading European producers of paper, board and packaging, as well as distributor of graphic paper and other office products. Wilhelm Seiler and Bunzl Italia operate as paper merchants, in Germany and Italy/Slovenia respectively</p>
<p>Merchant companies supply graphic paper - i.e. different kinds of coated and uncoated general printing and writing paper, except newsprint - produced by paper mills to the industries which use these products including printers, publishers, office machine distributors and large office paper users.
