<p>Algeria bounced back from World Cup disappointment with a convincing 4-1 victory over the Ivory Coast at the start of the 1998 African Nations' Cup qualifying campaign in Algiers on Sunday.</p>
<p>The one-sided victory -- one of 14 qualifying matches played on the contnent at the weekend -- came just months after the north Africans' shock elimination from the 1998 World Cup in the early qualifying round.</p>
<p>Their 3-2 aggregate defeat by Kenya in June led to the dissolution of the Algerian federation and a life ban on coaching in the country for Ali Fergani, a former World Cup hero who had taken Algeria to the 1996 Nations' Cup quarter-finals at the start of the year.</p>
<p>But a dominant performance in the group two match on Sunday, masterminded by acting coach Hamid Zouba, put Algerian soccer back on track.</p>
<p>Two goals each from captain Moussa Saib and striker Ali Messabih gave Algeria a confident start in their bid to qualify for the Nations' Cup finals in Burkina Faso in two years'time.</p>
<p>There were victories for several other heavily fancied contenders.</p>
<p>Ghana came back from conceding an early goal to Angola in group one in Accra on Sunday to triumph 2-1 with the winner scored by English-based striker Kim Grant. It was the first international goal in his third appearance for the Black Stars for Grant, who plays for first division Luton Town.</p>
<p>Zambia were also victors in their group seven encounter against Mozambique in Lusaka on Sunday but played a rear-guard action for most of the match after Kenneth Malitoli had given them a fourth-minute lead.</p>
<p>Egypt were held to a 1-1 draw by Morocco in group three in Cairo on Friday while Zaire also drew at home against disjointed Liberian team in Kinshasa on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Liberians, led by world footballer of the year George Weah, arrived in the central African country on the eve of the group six match without several of their home-based players, who finally turned up just hours before kick-off.</p>
<p>Liberia has been hit hard by an intermittent civil war and the team had to assemble in neighbouring Ivory Coast before heading south for the goalless match.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe, with controversial goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar as acting coach, beat Sudan 3-0 away in group one.</p>
<p>Malawi, Mali, Guinea and Senegal also scored valuable away wins.</p>
