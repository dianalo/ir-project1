<p>PCA International Inc, an operator of retail portrait photo studios, said Wednesday its board has approved reinstatement of the company's $0.07 per share quarterly cash dividend.</p>
<p>The dividend will be payable on July 2 for shareholders of record as of June 11, the company said.</p>
<p>It said the decision to resume paying dividends was due to favorable results and positive operating trends in the first quarter of 1997, which were released today.</p>
<p>The PCA board suspended the dividend in December, citing financial requirements of its purchase of American Studios Inc.  </p>
<p>The company said its board also authorized a $10 million prepayment of PCA's $65 million five-year term loan.</p>
<p>For the quarter ended May 4, PCA said that including the operations of American Studios, which it acquired in January, its sales rose 63 percent to $58.7 million from $36.1 million in the prior year.</p>
<p>It said net income for the latest quarter was $640,000 or $0.08 per share, compared with $1.1 million, or $0.14 per share, in the 1996 first quarter.</p>
<p>Earnings for the 1997 quarter were reduced by interest expense of $1.6 million and amortization of intangible assets of $500,000, both relating to the American Studios' acquisition, it said.</p>
