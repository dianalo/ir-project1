<p>The Polish zloty gave way to the buoyant dollar in lively trade on Wednesday, as the U.S. unit hit two-year high against the mark in European trade.</p>
<p>Dealers said trade was driven mainly by dollar/mark changes today but that domestic players generally continued to keep short foreign currency exposure to guard against a potential official interest rate rise by the National Bank of Poland.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot happened today as a result of the dollar's world rise...but in the upcoming days players should continue to sell excess currencies perhaps because of a possibility of an interest rate rise,&quot; said Pawel Gajewski of Creditanstalt.  </p>
<p>Some players expected the central bank to raise official interest rates after the NBP increased market rates and NBP-bill yields during the last few weeks.</p>
<p>The zloty closed at 3.09/3.04 percent from the trading band centre softer than Tuesday's 3.18/3.15 percent.</p>
<p>It was at 2.8885/00 to the dollar, down from 2.8800/15 on Tuesday and at 1.8373/83 to the mark, up from 1.8415/20.</p>
<p>Dealers said the zloty found strong resistance against the German mark at around 1.8360, perhaps under the weight of a large importer order, which was one of few domestically created impulses seen on the forex market over the last several days.  </p>
<p>On the money market overnight and tomorrow/next rates on remained flat closing at 21.75/22.10 and 21.80/22.15 pct respectively.</p>
<p>The NBP sold 700 million zlotys worth of its bills, raising the average yield of the 91-day paper by 0.06 point to 21.99 percent and its 273-day bill by 0.99 point to 22.00 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said banks exchanged T-bill portfolios for higher yielding NBP-bills on Wednesday, but most deals were made directly with clients and did not affect the secondary market.</p>
