<title>GERMANY: German call rates steady after reserve target set.</title>
<headline>German call rates steady after reserve target set.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-02-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>German overnight call rates were little changed on Monday at between 3.08 percent and 3.15 percent after the Bundesbank set a lower-than-expected minimum reserve requirement for February.</p>
<p>The central bank announced earlier that the preliminary minimum reserve requirement for this month had been set at 39.4 billion marks -- lower than expected and below the amount that banks already hold with the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The number is not as high as was feared,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>He and others said they doubt that the Bundesbank will make a significant net add to the money market this week.  </p>
<p>Traders said the Bundesbank will not want to let call rates slip to near three percent for fear of igniting speculation about a cut in interest rates.</p>
<p>Some predicted that Lombard borrowing could be heavy this week with pension fund payments making their way through the banking system, causing sharp swings in overnight rates.</p>
<p>As of Friday, banks held 41.7 billion marks with the Bundesbank, up from 41.4 billion marks the day before.</p>
<p>The average for the month so far stood at 40.3 billion marks as of Sunday. Credit institutions borrowed 300 million marks from the Lombard lending facility.</p>
