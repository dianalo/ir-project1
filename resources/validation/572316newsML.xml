<p>Police detained 24 Islamists in eastern Turkey on Friday as they took part in an unauthorised march to protest at an army-inspired closure plan for Islamic schools, state-run Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>After Friday prayers protesters marched from a mosque in the town of Bingol, chanting slogans in support of Turkey's religious Imam Hatip schools and Islamic sharia law.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not touch my Imam Hatip&quot;, &quot;Long live sharia&quot;, the agency reported them as chanting. It did not say how many protesters there were.</p>
<p>Scuffles broke out when police intervened to stop the march. One protester was injured in fighting as police tried to prevent another marcher from hurting himself with a knife, it said.</p>
<p>Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on Thursday expressed support for Imam Hatip schools, saying that denying people access to religious schools amounted to a human rights abuse.</p>
<p>He was speaking in opposition to a plan demanded by the powerful army that compulsory education be increased to eight years in the same school from the current five.</p>
<p>This would effectively shut down the middle section of state religious schools, which now begin to take pupils at 11.</p>
<p>Turkey's secularists, particularly the military, believe the Imam Hatip schools are used as a breeding ground for activists in Erbakan's Welfare Party.</p>
<p>The eight-year education plan was among demands set out by the military-led National Security Council (NSC) in February.</p>
<p>Erbakan, also a member of the NSC, was a signatory to the council's list of demands, but he has been criticised since for not implementing any of them.</p>
<p>An association for Imam Hatip graduates said in a statement on Friday the group will hold a rally at an Istanbul square this weekend to protest the plan to close their schools.</p>
