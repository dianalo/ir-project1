<p>Greece's socialist Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who gambled on early national elections, claimed a &quot;great victory&quot; on Sunday after winning a four-year term.</p>
<p>&quot;The people showed they want a new course for Greece and society. This great victory belongs to all citizens who envision a better future,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;This victory belongs to all who believe in development coupled with social justice.&quot;</p>
<p>Socialist supporters poured out on to the streets of Athens to celebrate, sounding car horns, waving flags and setting off firerworks into the night sky.</p>
<p>Simitis, 60, succeeded in January his mentor, ailing socialist party founder and three-term prime minister Andreas Papandreou, who died in June.</p>
<p>With his fresh win and new free hand he is expected to name his cabinet by Tuesday and may change both his defence and foreign ministers.</p>
<p>Greek opposition leader Miltiades Evert, who ran a surprisingly close race, conceded defeat and said he was resigning as leader of the conservative New Democracy party.</p>
<p>&quot;I take personal responsibility for the election result. I resign as president of the (conservative) party,&quot; he said in a brief televised statement.</p>
<p>Evert, 57, fought a vigorous campaign after Simitis called early elections and confounded pollsters by coming from behind to run a neck-and-neck race.</p>
<p>But early election returns showed the conservatives trailing by three percentage points and acting Interior Minister Vassilis Kouris said the socialist lead was irreversible.</p>
<p>Most embarrassing for Evert was that it appeared a solid block of conservatives had voted for Simitis.</p>
<p>With 15.6 percent of the vote counted, the socialists had 42.1 percent and the conservatives 39 percent. Electoral experts said that would give Simitis around 162 deputies in the 300-seat parliament, a solid absolute majority.</p>
