<headline>Danish shares up in selective market, falls ahead.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1996-12-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Danish share prices closed higher in a selectively focused market on Monday, cheered by rising bonds but dealers saw the risk of modest falls ahead as the market seemed to have run out of steam.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we can repeat today's advances tomorrow, the market began to founder towards the end of trading so we will probably trickle down,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index closed 1.99 point higher at 131.34 while the KFX December future put on 1.45 point to finish at 130.70 with 484 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.  </p>
<p>Tele Danmark benefited from its announcement on Friday of a major Swiss telecoms deal in cooperation with Britain's BT, closing 11 crowns up at 306, while Danisco, its first-half 1996/97 result due Wednesday, also attracted attention , ending the day three crowns higher at 335.</p>
<p>Otherwise leading banks did well, Den Danske Bank and Unidanmark putting on 10 and nine crowns to finish at 450 and 298 respectively.</p>
<p>SAS rose two crowns to 74 amid heavily denied rumours of merger plans with its German strategic partner Lufthansa.</p>
