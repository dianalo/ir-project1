<p>The United States said on Thursday that Saudi Arabia was shopping for jet fighters but reacted cautiously to a report that Riyadh will buy up to 100 Lockheed Martin Corp. F-16s in a multibillion-dollar deal.</p>
<p>The Washington Times said on Thursday that Saudi Defence Minister Prince Sultan was expected to bring a formal request for the F-16s to Washington next month in the latest in a long string of U.S. arms deals with the wealthy Gulf kingdom.</p>
<p>&quot;They have asked us some time ago about pricing information, which we provided. They have also been discussing this with contractors,&quot; Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters in response to questions.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not have any formal request or proposal from the government of Saudi Arabia about purchasing F-16s and therefore I can't go beyond that and give you any more details,&quot; Bacon added.</p>
<p>The Times, quoting U.S. government officials, said the deal could reach $30 billion. But industry officials said an F-16 cost $25 million, making such a deal worth about $2.5 billion before adding the price of maintenance support and costly air-to-air missiles.</p>
<p>Bacon said the Saudis were seeking replacements for their ageing fleet of 114 F-5 fighters bought from the United States in years past.</p>
<p>The White House and Lockheed said that the report was premature.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of enthusiasm in a lot of places for the idea, but we have received no official request or contract for that kind of sale from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The report is premature,&quot; Norman Robbins, a spokesman for Lockheed's tactical aircraft division in Fort Worth, Texas, told Reuters. He said talks had been under way but stressed that any deal would have to be approved by the two governments.</p>
<p>In addition to the the 114 F-5 jets, the Saudis are now flying 98 more advanced F-15 C and D model fighters built by McDonnell Douglas Corp.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia bought an additional 72 advanced F-15S model ground attack jets from McDonnell in 1994 for $9.2 billion and have taken delivery of 17 of those, according to U.S. Air Force officials.</p>
<p>A new sale of fighter jets to the Saudis would come at a time of tension between Washington and Riyadh over two bombings in Saudi Arabia in a little over a year that have killed 24 Americans.</p>
<p>FBI and U.S. Justice Department officials this month accused the Saudis of a lack of full cooperation in a joint investigation of the truck bombing of a military housing complex in Dhahran last June 25 that killed 19 U.S. troops.</p>
<p>Five other Americans died in a bombing at a Saudi National Guard facility in Riyadh in late 1995.</p>
