<p>German prosecutors on Wednesday dropped an investigation into possible tax evasion by Steffi Graf after probing the tennis player's finances for nearly two years.</p>
<p>&quot;The Mannheim prosecutor's office has dropped its investigation proceedings against Stefanie Graf on suspicion of tax evasion with the agreement of the accused and the Mannheim court,&quot; prosecutors in the southern city said in a statement.</p>
<p>Graf was ordered to pay a sum of money to charity -- a procedure often used by German prosecutors with the agreement of the accused to end a case which they do not believe merits a lengthy legal process.</p>
<p>Graf's office refused to comment on the size of the payment and would not say if the world number one was in the country. The player said she had agreed to pay the money although she stressed that she had done nothing illegal.</p>
<p>&quot;I have agreed to a payment for the dropping of the proceedings with a heavy heart, although I know that I have nothing to reproach myself for and I have done nothing illegal,&quot; Graf said in a statement.</p>
<p>Graf, 27, said she had agreed to the payment so she could concentrate completely on her tennis and her new German-based business. Graf, who is also active in fashion and advertising, recently managed a major tennis event for the first time.</p>
<p>The tax investigations, which have been front-page news in Germany, officially started in April 1995. The homes of Graf and her father Peter were searched the following month.</p>
<p>Graf's father was sentenced early this year to three years and nine months in jail for actual and attempted tax evasion amounting to 12 million marks on Steffi's income.</p>
<p>Former family tax adviser Joachim Eckardt received two and a half years for complicity.</p>
<p>But both Graf and Eckardt remain free because prosecutors and defence appealed against the sentence. Prosecutors said on Wednesday that they were waiting for the full written details of the court's judgement before the appeal can be processed.</p>
<p>The appeal would then have to be passed onto a higher court -- a process which could take months.</p>
<p>Chief state prosecutor in Mannheim, Horst Kuehner, said the investigations against Steffi and the case against her father were totally separate.</p>
<p>&quot;This had nothing to do with the Peter Graf case. They are completely separate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Steffi Graf, whose signature was on all the tax returns, has always denied any involvement in the affair, saying she had entrusted financial matters to her father and his advisers from an early age.</p>
<p>But although she has continued to perform brilliantly on court in the last two years, Graf has said several times that the tax affair has been a major stress in her life.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no doubt that I would have shown my innocence during proceedings. I wanted to save myself the accompanying furore that would have come with a full trial,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The seven-times Wimbledon champion, who has not played since the semifinals of a tournament in Tokyo on February 1 because of a knee injury, could make a return to the court at the end of April in the German Open.</p>
<p>Before then, however, Graf will lose the number one spot that she first held in 1987. Switzerland's 16-year-old Martina Hingis is due to take over the prestigious position on March 31, ending Graf's latest run of 94 consecutive weeks at the top.</p>
