<headline>Madrid stocks bump lower as traders take profits.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-06-17</dateline>

<p>Madrid stocks ended sharply lower on Tuesday, tracking major markets overseas, as profit-taking continued in thinner than usual volume, dealers said.</p>
<p>However the slide did not cause too much concern, and most thought gains could ensue once the market has taken a breather.</p>
<p>The general index fell 6.54 points, 1.13 percent, to 571.84 and the Ibex-35 shed 83.39 points, 1.26 percent, to 6,543.81.</p>
<p>The biggest stocks saw sharp losses, especially banks, after hefty gains this year. BBV slipped 2.2 pct to 11,090, Santander shed 2.1 pct to 4,345.</p>
<p>&quot;There nothing new in this, it's simply profit-taking after a good run this year and inspired by U.S. inflation coming in line with expectations,&quot; said a Spanish bank dealer.</p>
<p>Much of today's volume was accounted by put-throughs, and there were few final investors in the market, he added.</p>
<p>Telefonica shed 75 pesetas to 4,255 in thinner trade than usual despite an upgraded recommendation from Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>Gas Natural was one of few gainers, adding 280 pesetas to 30,550, a technical movement after recent losses, and also ahead of Wednesday's shareholders' meeting, analysts said.</p>
