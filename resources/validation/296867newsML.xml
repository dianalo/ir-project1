<p>Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda said on Thursday that capital markets perked up after he reassured industrialists last month.</p>
<p>&quot;There was this decline in the capital market for a few days, weeks. After the 31st (December) meeting, you have all witnessed there is some improvement,&quot; Deve Gowda told the Confederation of Indian Industry's annual meeting in Calcutta.</p>
<p>&quot;This itself is a clear indication that the government means business,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda met industrialists on December 31 and listened to their proposals on how to arrest a slowdown in industrial growth. He told them at that time that his government would take steps by mid-January to boost capital markets.</p>
<p>The government last week announced capital gains tax exemptions to boost investment in infrastructure companies.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Deve Gowda promised more decisions before he leaving for a world economic summit in Davos, Switzerland, which begins later this month.</p>
