<p>The traditional clatter of newsroom typewriters was replaced by the click of computer mice on Thursday as seriously wired journalists surfed their way around a U.S.-Russian summit via the Internet.</p>
<p>As Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin arrived in Finland -- the world's most online country -- journalists covering the event could watch them land by navigating their way around dozens of Web pages on 50 Internet-linked machines.</p>
<p>At least two World Wide Web sites competed to offer video or sound action piped through telephone lines to the summit press centre, and to multi-media Internet machines worldwide.</p>
<p>For real airport action, journalists in the press centre relied on television monitors, but a final press conference after the presidents meet on Friday will also air on the Web, via page www.virtual.finland.fi.</p>
<p>Such high-tech access may seem to hold appeal only for computer buffs -- nerds in their own language -- but the firms offering the services say they are on the threshold of serious business opportunities.</p>
<p>For the summiteers, too, the Internet is a growing platform: both presidents have home pages on the Internet although Boris Yeltsin's is currently only available in Russian. For Clinton, getting all American schools wired by 2000 is a policy goal.</p>
<p>Even the Clinton family's pet cat Socks has its own web site.</p>
<p>&quot;On a small scale it's history in the making,&quot; said Erkki Vihtanen of state broadcaster YLE, one of the companies offering the services. &quot;We're not advertising it too much because if everybody tries to watch it there will be problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Web pages tend to freeze when many people try to access them at the same time, but the summit's Finnish organisers said they had anticipated heavy demand for their sites.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not as live as television but it's the next fastest thing,&quot; said Markus Leikola of A4 Media, whose web camera the Finnish foreign ministry contracted to follow the presidents around the Finnish capital.</p>
<p>His airport camera fed images through a portable computer, linked to a mobile phone, working at minus five degrees Celsius (minus 23 Fahrenheit). Unfortunately that overtaxed the battery so the signal was lost just as Clinton emerged from the plane.</p>
<p>Neither firm could say yet how many &quot;hits&quot; or visits their sites had received for the arrivals, but YLE's Vihtanen said hundreds of people had tried to access its site even though it is not yet fully operational.</p>
<p>Leikola, whose summit work is a showcase for a new Web-based realtime audio service for investors, said his company was &quot;making money&quot; on the summit operation, and the audio site was ready to cater for &quot;many thousands&quot; of worldwide hits on Friday.</p>
<p>Internet enthusiasts will be able to follow the presidents' news conference in real-time audio at the click of a button, and Likola said they can return to the site for some weeks afterwards to hear it again.</p>
