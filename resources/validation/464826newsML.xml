<p>Rescuers have found the body of geologist Michael de Guzman, who fell to his death from a helicopter while flying to the Busang gold property he helped discover in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>Sugianto, chief of the airport in Samarinda, the provincial capital of East Kalimantan, said the body was found on Sunday some 25 nautical miles from Samarinda.</p>
<p>&quot;Search and rescue officials found his body at around 12.30 p.m. (0530 GMT) yesterday about 25 nautical miles from Samarinda,&quot; he told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been no further details from the rescue officials,&quot; Sugianto said. &quot;I have sent a helicopter to the location to bring the body back to Samarinda.&quot;</p>
<p>De Guzman, a Filipino national, was on his way to the Busang property on Wednesday morning when the back door of the Allouette 3 helicopter burst open 17 minutes after leaving Samarinda airport, search and rescue officials said.</p>
<p>The helicopter had been hired by Canadian exploration company Bre-X Minerals Ltd, where de Guzman was chief geologist, and was said to be in good condition.</p>
<p>The Busang motherlode, estimated by Bre-X to contain at least 71 million ounces of gold currently worth around $25 billion, is the biggest gold find this century.</p>
<p>Bre-X has entered into an an agreement with Indonesian partners and the U.S. mining giant Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc to develop Busang.</p>
<p>Frank Cimafranca, third secretary and consul at the Philippine embassy in Jakarta, said he had not received official word on the discovery of de Guzman's body.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been no official communication yet that de Guzman's body has been found,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The death of de Guzman coupled with a newspaper report that Busang contained less than the estimated gold reserves hit Bre-X share prices on the Toronto Stock Exchange last Friday, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Indonesian Harian Ekonomi Neraca newspaper reported on Friday that a review by New Orleans-based Freeport showed the desposit was smaller than Bre-X's estimate.</p>
<p>Freeport said last Friday its due diligence of the site, its checks before completing the agreement on Busang, was not finished. Indonesian Mines and Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana said on Sunday his department would look into news reports about the Busang deposit.</p>
<p>The Busang property was the subject of a bidding war a few months ago as several mining companies wooed the Indonesian government for control of the property.</p>
