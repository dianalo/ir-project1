<p>-- CLOTHES GROUP DASHES HOPES OF SWIFT REVIVAL</p>
<p>Country Casuals, the clothes group, has warned of slow business from its larger-size womanswear chain Elvi, thus ruining hopes of a swift recovery from three years of decline. The group admitted that its profits for the year would be below market expectations but not less than one million stg. Elvi will continue making a loss despite restructuring earlier this year, when 11 stores were closed.</p>
<p>-- ALLIED COLLOIDS PAYS 234 MILLION STG FOR US CHEMICALS SUPPLIER</p>
<p>The maker of water soluble chemicals and super absorbent polymers for nappies, Allied Colloids, is buying the American CPs Chemical Company, one of its suppliers, for $390 million. The firm is raising 173 million stg through a rights issue to help fund the purchase. Of the purchase price, almost 90 per cent represents goodwill for American tax purposes. Allied plans to save $8 million a year in tax by writing this off.</p>
<p>-- UNIGATE SEEKS FRESH TARGETS</p>
<p>The St Ivel fresh foods and dairy products group Unigate has unveiled flat interim pre-tax profits of 60.6 million stg and said it is still seeking more acquisitions. Unigate has net cash of 58 million stg and Ross Buckland, chief executive, said the company is prepared to expand beyond areas in which it usually operates and this would have to be a large acquisition.</p>
<p>THE TIMES</p>
<p>-- TAXMAN ACTED ILLEGALLY OVER VAT REFUNDS</p>
<p>Customs and excise has been told by the Justice Keene, a High Court judge, that it has been acting illegally in the deferred paying out on legitimate claims for backdated VAT beyond a three-year limit. This could be a landmark ruling that could lead to claims for overpaid value-added tax costing the Treasury as much as five billion stg. He has instructed Customs to make payments, totalling 35 million stg, in eight test cases involving groups as diverse as GUS, the Federation of Opthalmic and Dispensing Opticians and the Mercers Company of the City of London.</p>
<p>-- VODAFONE POCKETS PEOPLES PHONE</p>
<p>The largest mobile phone company, Vodafone, has agreed to buy Peoples Phone for 77 million stg in a move to keep the service provider from takeover. Vodafone's chief executive Sir Gerald Whent said the acquisition was defensive because more than three-quarters of Peoples Phone's 400,000 customers are Vodafone users. Peoples has 181 high street shops and targets the consumer market.</p>
<p>-- GOOD CAUSES LOSE OUT ON 110 MILLION STG AS LOTTERY SALES SLIP</p>
<p>According to the latest financial snapshot from National Lottery operator Camelot, tumbling sales of lottery tickets have cost good causes more than 110 million stg this year. Sales of Instant scratchcards have fallen to 419 million stg in the six months to September, compared with 871 million stg in the same period last year. A midweek lottery draw is planned for February and Camelot says the move could boost online lottery ticket sales by up to 20 per cent, although there are concerns that Instants could suffer a further decline.</p>
<p>THE GUARDIAN</p>
<p>-- LABOUR VOW TO CURB WATER METERING</p>
<p>The Labour Party has released its blueprint for the water industry promising a crackdown to make companies more accountable to customers, bringing them under tighter regulatory control and forcing them to invest more in their infrastructure. Labour insists that the 10 regional companies will not be allowed to force customers to accept water metering, the system accepted by the Government, as a way of controlling demand. Labour claims that metering would affect the most vulnerable, such as pensioners and families on low income, and could affect public health.</p>
<p>-- IRAN PLAYS DOWN CONTROVERSY AND TRIES TO ENTICE BUSINESS</p>
<p>The Islamic Republic is trying to tempt British businessmen into its potentially lucrative market. Firms were represented at a CBI conference to hear an Iranian team advertise a country striving for regional stability and liberalising its economy so as to attract foreign investment. CBI figures show mounting British interest in Iran, being the only leading OECD country to increase its exports.</p>
<p>-- BAE SEEKS GERMAN LINK</p>
<p>British Aerospace has underlined its plans to expand its naval systems interests and to push for greater integration of the European defence industry by confirming it is in wide-ranging talks with German defence groups about possible co-operation. The company is discussing the possibilities of a tie-up with industrial conglomerate Mannesmann, defence groups Rheinmetall and Wegmann, and ship-building group Bremer Vulkan. The talks centre on the acquisition of STN Atlas Elektronik, Germany's leading producer of defence electronics.</p>
<p>THE INDEPENDENT</p>
<p>-- BONUSES SOAR TO 315 MILLION STG IN SECURITIES TRADING FIRMS DESPITE DANGER SIGNALS ON RISING COSTS</p>
<p>Stock Exchange figures show that a booming stock market is lining the pockets of brokers and market-makers. Bonuses paid by Stock Exchange member firms to employees have soared by 100 million stg to a record 315 million stg in the year to June. The figures confirm widespread reports of huge rewards throughout the City as business volumes and profitability shot up and gave an insight into the financial industry's bonuses and profit-sharing.</p>
<p>-- GRANADA LAUNCHES HOTEL SALES</p>
<p>The leisure and media conglomerate Granada has launched the disposal of its Exclusive Hotels, with the sale of the Hyde Park Hotel in London for 86 million stg to a unit of Singapore-based Jardine Matheson, Mandarin Oriental International. The sale marks the first step toward selling all 17 Exclusive Hotels, obtained after the takeover of Forte  FTE.L. The rest of the portfolio is expected to generate 900 million stg and will be used to pay down Granada's 3.5 billion debt. -- TAKEOVER TALK LIFTS LONDON ELECTRICITY</p>
<p>Reports have emerged that the US utility Entergy is preparing a 1.2 billion stg bid for London Electricity. Both parties refused to comment but rumours suggest Entergy has singled out an unnamed UK bid target which closely resembles London. A formal offer would put a price tag of seven pounds stg on each share in the company. The speculation boosted London's share price 28.5 pence stg to 665 pence stg.</p>
