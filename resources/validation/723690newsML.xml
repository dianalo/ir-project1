<p>*Australian debt simmered down after Thursday's blistering rally, but although the RBA remained silent on policy, analysts feel that an easing is on cards.</p>
<p>*Housing finance weaker than expected at down 8.4 percent.  </p>
<p>The Australian debt market simmered down after Thursday's blistering rally which took long dated yields to their lowest level in 3-1/2 years, but remained convinced that monetary policy would be loosened again.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank remained silent on policy after Thursday's weaker than expected employment report, although this came as no great surprise given that it may have been seen as a panic reaction to a lagging indicator, analysts said.</p>
<p>They saw such a move as more likely after the inflation and wages reports later this month and possibly after the August 5 board meeting.  </p>
<p>&quot;For bonds, it is consoldiation time. The three-year part of the curve now looks to be close to fully priced...and the 10-year bonds need an injection of fresh news to spike towards 6.5 percent and 25 basis points on the spread to the U.S.,&quot; said economists at Citibank Australia in a report.</p>
<p>The Australian/U.S. 10-year bond yield spread sank to around 35 basis points at one stage on Thursday, its lowest level since the early 1980s.</p>
<p>A larger than expected 8.4 percent fall in May housing finance drew little reaction from the market, being largely a correction to the 12.2 percent jump the previous month.  </p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The local market slightly underperformed the U.S. and Canada after Thursday's sharp tightening. However, it narrowed to the short-end of the New Zealand curve following a larger than expected March quarter current account and after the RBNZ warned that monetary conditions were too easy.  </p>
