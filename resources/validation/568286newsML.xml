<p>The Indonesian subsidiary of U.S. Newmont Mining Corp rejected on Wednesday a government bid to secure a 10 percent stake in its Batu Hijau copper and gold project that would cost $2 billion to develop.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not feasible. We are already carrying a 20-percent (local) partner...the project will not carry another,&quot; PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara president-director Eric Hamer said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is economics. It is a very tight project,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;Anyway, I need to talk to the (mines) minister myself and Adjat Sudradjat (the director-general of mining).&quot;</p>
<p>Mines and Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana said on Tuesday the government had asked Newmont Nusa for at least a 10-percent stake in the Batu Hijau project in West Nusa Tenggara province.</p>
<p>The move follows an independent consultants' report on Busang mine on Indonesia's half of Borneo island which concluded geological samples had been falsified and that the mine contained no economic gold deposit.</p>
<p>Hamer also said he had heard from official sources the government was about to grant Newmont Nusa permission to begin constructing a mine at Batu Hijau after a delay of six months.</p>
<p>&quot;We have heard they will do so,&quot; he said. &quot;But I won't believe it until I see it in my hand.&quot;</p>
<p>Sudjana said two Indonesian companies, which he identified as Barito and Citra, had shown interest in the project but had yet to make an official approach to the government.</p>
<p>Barito Pacific is controlled by timber baron Prajogo Pangestu, while Citra Marga is headed by President Suharto's eldest daughter, Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana.</p>
<p>Sudjana also said the ministry was considering requiring foreign mining companies to give the government a 10 percent stake in all future projects as part of a tightening up in mining rules following the Busang scandal.</p>
<p>Sudjana said his ministry had suspended all operations of Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd and its subsidiaries in Indonesia following the report on Busang.</p>
<p>Bre-X had earlier estimated Busang contained more than 70 million ounces of gold, which would have made it the biggest find of the century.</p>
<p>Indonesian businessman Jusuf Merukh, who claims to own 40 percent of the Busang property, also holds a 20-percent stake in Batu Hijau.</p>
<p>Hamer reiterated on Wednesday that under the contract of work issued by the government in 1986, Newmont Nusa had to offer for sale a fixed percentage of its shares to local companies between the sixth and 11th year of production at Batu Hijau.</p>
<p>After the 11th year of commercial production, Newmont Nusa's stake in the project was to be reduced to 49 percent.</p>
<p>Batu Hijau, which is expected to have a life of 20 to 25 years, has yet to begin production. Newmont Nusa had invested $140 million in the project and the total cost of the project is expected to reach $2 billion.</p>
<p>Batu Hijau contains an estimated 5.3 million tonnes of copper and 13.4 million ounces of gold.</p>
