<p>President Boris Yeltsin may finally get to grips with Russia's military reform agenda and the replacement of generals sacked for corruption when he chairs a much-delayed meeting of Russia's Defence Council on Thursday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin promised during his re-election campaign a year ago to end conscription by the year 2000 and create a modern, professional army from the bloated and underfunded Cold War carcass the Russian armed forces have become.</p>
<p>With conscripts dying in their thousands in the debacle of his Chechen campaign, that was good politics. Since then, the realities of funding expensive reforms have seen the deadline quietly shelved. And with Yeltsin seriously ill for the first eight months of his new term, little other progress was made.</p>
<p>Now, however, the 66-year-old president, conscious of having just three years left to write himself into history as a successful ruler, has recovered some of his zeal for change.</p>
<p>After shaking up the government by promoting a team of young liberal economic reformers, he seems ready to take on the military, whose 1.8 million men under arms and privileged inheritance as a pillar of the Soviet system make it a key component of Russian society.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has mounted a drive against deep-rooted and widespread official corruption. The campaign is being spearheaded by government economy chiefs, who see it as vital to restoring the state finances and winning public confidence.</p>
<p>The biggest heads to roll so far, however, have not been in the civil service but the military, creating vacancies that, as with the cabinet, give Yeltsin the chance to promote reformers.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source saying the Defence Council may name a successor to Land Forces Commander General Vladimir Semyonov, who was sacked and charged with corruption a month ago. Kremlin spokesmen decined comment.</p>
<p>The likely candidate, Interfax said, is General Viktor Chechevatov, commander of the Far East military district, who is close to the Kremlin leader. Other top posts may also be filled.</p>
<p>General Konstantin Kobets, a deputy defence minister who rose to prominence by defending Yeltsin during the hardline communist coup of 1991, was charged with graft this week.</p>
<p>Military prosecutors said Kobets was arrested on Wednesday. Hours earlier, the general said he was being forced out of hospital while still sick to face interrogation.</p>
<p>Military prosecutors say as many as 20 generals and 100 colonels are under investigation for graft. Stories abound of army stores, from rations to rockets, being sold off for private profit and of defence contractors building lavish country dachas for the top brass in exchange for lucrative army orders.</p>
<p>The situation is all the more scandalous because the vast majority of officers and men live on the bread line.</p>
<p>The longer term strategy for military reform is muddied by differences between the military and civilian planners, notably Defence Council secretary Yuri Baturin, a trusted Yeltsin aide.</p>
<p>Many top generals have appeared reluctant to scale back from a force designed to protect a superpower from a massed onslaught from the West.</p>
<p>But the bloodletting in the upper ranks, a new security doctrine which plays down the risk of all-out attack from abroad and a treaty with NATO to be signed next week, all point to the balance swinging in favour of a smaller, more flexible army.</p>
<p>Yeltsin this week suspended a plan to scrap the separate status of the elite paratroops. That may also indicate more willingness to favour developing regional rapid-response forces.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Igor Rodionov, who hung up his uniform in December to become Russia's first civilian in the post, warns that such reforms will cost Moscow dear, not least because professional soldiers will need professional pay.</p>
<p>After speculation about his future, Yeltsin endorsed Rodionov in February and urged him to press on with reform.</p>
