<p>Portland Natural Gas Transmission System and Maritimes &amp; Northeast Pipeline are negotiating on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's proposal they consider ways to limit environmental damage with their competing pipelines, Portland Natural spokesman John Flumerfelt told Reuters Monday.</p>
<p>When it gave preliminary approval to both proposals in July, FERC urged them to consider a jointly-owned pipeline or building on the same right-of-way where the pipelines follow the same routing.  </p>
<p>In case the talks do not bear fruit, Flumerfelt said, Portland Natural Gas proposed upgrading its project from 20-inch diameter pipeline to a combination of 24- and 30-inch diameter pipeline, following the same route, to accommodate both the volumes a joint venture would produce.</p>
<p>The proposal was made in an amended application filed with FERC Friday, Portland Natural said.</p>
<p>It said the amended application also requests approval for 48 miles of lateral pipelines to serve new markets and proposes a revised route for the northern-most 72 miles of the project to better serve local industrial markets.  </p>
<p>The filing also seeks approval of revised transportation rates, and requests FERC's supplemental preliminary determination on non-environmental issues by February 1997 and final certificate authorizations by August 31, 1997.</p>
<p>This is needed to permit an in-service date of November 1, 1998 for the entire project, Portland Natural explained.</p>
<p>The system is co-owned by Bay State Gas Co, Tenneco Inc, Gaz Metropolitain and Co LP, MCN Corp, TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, and US Generating Co, owned by Pacific Gas and Electric Co  Bechtel Group Inc.  </p>
<p>Maritimes and Northeast, the first phase of a pipeline that will eventually ship natural gas from Sable Island off Canada's east coast to the U.S., is owned by PanEnergy Corp, Westcoast Energy Inc, Eastern Enterprises and Mobil Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;Our revised proposal improves the overall economics of the project and opens up new market opportunities in areas of New Hampshire and Maine that currently are not served by natural gas,&quot; PNGTS Operating Co LLC said.</p>
<p>It listed the new customers as Wausau Papers in New Hampshire and paper mills in western Maine operated by Boise Cascade Corp and International Paper Co.</p>
<p>The mainline re-route involves the pipeline route in northern New Hampshire and Vermont and will place the pipeline in closer proximity to primary industrial markets in that region while reducing the length of mainline by 17.8 miles. The new alignment primarily lies within or adjacent to existing electric transmission corridors, the pipeline noted. overall environmental impact than the route that was originally proposed. -- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610.</p>
