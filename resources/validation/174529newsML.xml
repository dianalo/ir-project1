<p>Shenzhen's B share index gave up early gains and closed slightly lower on Thursday, with investors reducing their positions ahead of Friday's listing of Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd's 250 million B shares, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B share index shed 0.21 points, or 0.23 percent, to 89.35 on turnover of HK$12.79 million, down from HK$21.65 million on Thursday.</p>
<p>Some investors took funds out of existing issues to prepare for Changan's first day of trading, brokers said.</p>
<p>Property issue China Vanke lost HK$0.12, or 2.99 percent, to HK$3.90 in thin trade of 3,190 shares.  </p>
<p>Building materials producer Fangda fell HK$0.10, or 2.27 percent, to HK$4.30 as 73,600 shares were traded on profit-taking, brokers said. Dadonghai traded the most on volume of 1.59 million shares and slipped HK$0.02 to HK$1.30.</p>
