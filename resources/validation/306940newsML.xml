<p>Dutch Brewer Grolsch NV said on Tuesday it was not scaling back its operations in Germany and would continue to focus on selected regional markets in that country.</p>
<p>Recent Dutch media reports had suggested that Grolsch, distributed in Germany by Brau und Brunnen AG had switched to limited regional distribution in Germany, but Grolsch spokesman Cees Dubbeldam said this was incorrect.</p>
<p>&quot;When we signed the distribution agreement with Brau und Brunnen, we decided to focus on three areas: Cologne, Hamburg and Berlin. That has not changed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dubbeldam said imports were a very small section of theGerman market and subject to fierce competition.</p>
<p>&quot;Imports account for only one or two percent of the German market. Carlsberg has about three quarters of the import business, with other brewers fighting for the rest,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dubbeldam said it would be much too expensive for Grolsch to distribute its beer all over Germany and that it had therefore decided to focus on three urban regions when it entered its agreement with its German distributor.</p>
<p>&quot;Our German activities are based on marketing reasons. Germany has a reputation for quality beer so it's good to be present and we intend to stay but not to expand there.&quot;</p>
<p>Grolsch had always been responsible for its own marketing activities in Germany and would continue to be so, he added.</p>
<p>Brau und Brunnen, which is expected to remain loss-making in 1997, said in December it was rationalising its operations with a view to returning to profit by 1998. Grolsch is distributed in the Hamburg and Cologne areas by Wickuler, a former Grolsch unit sold to Brau und Brunnen. In the Berlin area Grolsch is distributed by the German company's Schultheiss unit.</p>
