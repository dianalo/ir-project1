<title>UK: Citibank certificates, stolen in 1980s, turn up again.</title>
<headline>Citibank certificates, stolen in 1980s, turn up again.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>
<text>
<p>Citibank said Monday a number of cancelled bond certificates, originally thought to have been destroyed in the 1980s, had turned up again in connection with fraud attempts.</p>
<p>But Citibank said it had no material financial exposure to any of the securities and the British Bankers Association (BBA) separately said its members were warned about the circulation of the phoney certificates as early as 1995.</p>
<p>Citibank issued a statement following a report in the Evening Standard newspaper that it retained a British private detective, Chris Morris, to recover stolen bonds with an estimated face value of at least $111 billion.</p>
<p>The newspaper said millions of dollars of bonds had begun to reappear in what police believed was the biggest crime in banking history. The Standard said according to police the bonds were stolen by the Mafia from a New Jersey waste disposal firm.</p>
<p>Citibank in its statement said cancelled securities which had resurfaced had been fraudulently presented, but it denied it had ever had a contract with a private detective to recover the securities.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1985-86 Citibank used an outside destruction firm, MSM Corp., to dispose of a number of cancelled certificates,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Subsequently the bank discovered that a number of these certificates thought to have been destroyed had reappeared and some have been fraudulently presented for transfer or offered as collateral for loans.&quot;</p>
<p>Citibank said that since 1985-86 it had worked closely with the FBI, the U.S. Durg Enforcement Agency, the international banking community, Interpol and law enforcement agencies around the world to recover the stolen certificates.</p>
<p>There was no mention of the Mafia in the statement.</p>
<p>It added: &quot;Citibank is not able to provide details of any specific joint recovery activities with the City of London Police or any other law enforcement authority. However, we strongly refute any allegation that Chris Morris had a contract with Citibank.&quot;</p>
<p>The Evening Standard reported that Morris was used as part of a complex sting operation set up in 1995 by the City of London police and the FBI to recover the stolen bonds.</p>
<p>A City of London police spokesperson was not available for comment.</p>
<p>A British Bankers Association spokesman said its members were alerted early to the incident through its fraud intelligence unit early in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;We're reassured that members had adequate warning of this,&quot; he said. &quot;We were on the trail of it through the fraud unit well before the bonds actually surfaced.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that as with any sort of false paper, a warning notice was sent as soon the BBA became aware of any risk. The spokesman said he did not have an estimate of the amount of bonds, in terms of face value, which had resurfaced. He also said the BBA was not aware of any recent occurences of stolen bonds resurfacing, although that did not mean none had.</p>
