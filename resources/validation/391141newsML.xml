<p>Indonesia largest noodle maker PT Indofood Sukses Makmur of the Salim Group said on Thursday its plans to acquire six companies in the group controlled by tycoon Liem Sioe Liong would benefit shareholders.</p>
<p>&quot;It will give added value to shareholders...to asset growth and profit gain,&quot; Indofood chief executive officer Eva Riyanti Hutapea told a briefing for analysts on the acquisitions.</p>
<p>She said the acquisitions were aimed at extending the firm's product range and to ensure a steady supply of raw material.</p>
<p>Hutapea said that after the acquisitions were completed, the firm would focus on branded packed food and cooking oil.</p>
<p>The acquisitions, announced last November, are subject to approval by shareholders who will meet on March 17.</p>
<p>In the company's prospectus distributed to the analysts, Indofood said the acquisitions would cost an estimated 1.750 trillion rupiah, of which just over 70 percent would be financed by a rights issue and the rest through loans.</p>
<p>On February 6, Indofood announced a four-for-one rights issue priced at 3,300 rupiah to 4,000 rupiah per share.</p>
<p>The proceeds, expected to be around 1.259 trillion rupiah, would be used to acquire the six companies.</p>
<p>The companies are PT Salim Ivomas Pratama which owns oil palm plantations, PT Intiboga Sejahtera which produces cooking oil and fats, palm oil trader PT Salim Oil Grains, PT Bitung Menado Oil Ltd which produces and exports coconut oil and its products, PT Argha Giri Perkasa which processes coconut oil and distributor PT Indomarco Adi Prima.</p>
<p>Responding to a question on the estimated capital expenditure of each targeted company in 1997, Hutapea said the plantation business would spend some 22 billion rupiah.</p>
<p>&quot;We plan to spend about 15 billion rupiah to build a mill and about six to seven billion rupiah to expand an existing mill,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She said for the edible oil business, the companies involved planned to allocate 27 billion rupiah for refineries in Surabaya and Sulawesi this year. She gave no further details.</p>
<p>An official from Indomarco, principal distributor of Indofood products, said it would spend a total of 20.5 billion rupiah in 1997, of which 8.5 billion would be used to improve its transportation equipment, three billion rupiah on its computer system and nine billion rupiah on its warehouses.</p>
<p>On Thursday, shares of Indofood Sukses Makmur closed 25 rupiah higher at 5,375 rupiah on a volume of 187,500 shares.</p>
