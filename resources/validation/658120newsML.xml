<p>Hong Kong's future government on Thursday shrugged off a snub by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has decided to boycott a ceremony to inaugurate the controversial post-handover legislature.</p>
<p>The swearing-in will be &quot;a ceremony which will show that the executive branch, legislature and the judiciary are all taking office at the same time&quot;, said Rita Fan, president of the provisional legislature, which Britain has sharply denounced.</p>
<p>The plan to install the legislature promptly after the flag change, while international VIPs who came for the handover party are still in town, would not be changed, Fan said.</p>
<p>The United States earlier said it too would shun the inauguration, reflecting Western disapproval that the unelected chamber will replace a democratically-elected parliament at midnight on June 30, when China takes back Hong Kong after 156 years of British colonial rule.</p>
<p>Future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa, senior government officials and top judges will also be sworn in during the ceremony in the first few hours of July 1. The timing of the inauguration was decided by a China-backed committee.</p>
<p>Henry Tang, a member of Tung's post-handover inner council, said the provisional legislature must be part of the swearing-in as it was a formal event to transfer administrative powers to the new government.</p>
<p>The inauguration would not be affected by criticism from foreign countries, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an event that is a Chinese people's event and we will not be swayed by those who don't belong here,&quot; Tang said.</p>
<p>More than 4,000 guests invited by Britain and China are expected to witness a glitzy joint handover ceremony on the night of June 30, marking the end of Britain's once-sprawling empire in Asia and China's national shame.</p>
<p>Blair and VIPs from other countries that contest the legitimacy of the provisional legislature were put in a diplomatic bind by China's plans to swear in the unelected chamber at the same venue immediately after the handover.</p>
<p>Blair said on Wednesday he would attend the handover ceremony, but officials made clear he would leave before the provisional legislature is sworn in.</p>
<p>Heir to the throne Prince Charles and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook will also attend as Britain's top representatives.</p>
<p>Colonial Governor Chris Patten welcomed Blair's plan to attend but said he hoped China would back down on its plan to swear in the provisional legislature just after the handover.</p>
<p>But Patten said he had not urged any foreign leaders to boycott China's ceremony.</p>
<p>Political analyst Michael DeGolyer said discord between Beijing and London over Patten's democratic reforms had set the stage for the &quot;awkward dispute&quot; surrounding the ceremonies.</p>
<p>The handover would be a matter of &quot;you have your party and I'll have mine&quot;, with any interaction between the British and Chinese kept as formal and ceremonial as possible, said DeGolyer, director of a long-term study on the transition based at Hong Kong's Baptist University.</p>
<p>China ended months of speculation on Wednesday by announcing President Jiang Zemin would lead its delegation, the first visit to the territory by a Chinese head of state.</p>
<p>Jiang will receive the territory of 6.4 million people from Prince Charles, then remain just long enough for the swearing-in of the new administration before flying home for China's own mammoth celebration on the streets of Beijing.</p>
<p>Premier Li Peng, scorned by many Hong Kong people as a &quot;butcher of Beijing&quot; for his perceived role in unleashing the 1989 military crackdown in China, and Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, as well as other top officials will accompany Jiang on the trip.</p>
