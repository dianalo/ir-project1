<title>UK: Europe's forex markets winding down for year-end.</title>
<headline>Europe's forex markets winding down for year-end.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-13</dateline>

<p>Europe's currency markets are gearing down for the Christmas holidays with trading volume and activity ebbing towards a convenient break from this year's late burst of forex volatility.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets are very thin and it's not going to get any better before the end of the year,&quot; said a currency dealer at a Japanese bank in London. &quot;Day by day we have seen the number of participants in the marketplace shrinking and the duration of positions getting shorter.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said a number of smaller banks and even a few of the bigger houses have stopped quoting prices in the interbank market altogether until the new year, putting a damper on volume and restricting liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;This is typical for this time of year but it seems more noticeable given the burst of volatility we've had in recent weeks,&quot; said a Swiss bank forex trader.</p>
<p>&quot;After the moves we've had, it's a good time to book profits and shut up shop. And those that haven't made their money are unlikely to claw it back before the year-end in these markets.&quot;</p>
<p>Although dealers anticipated currency markets to remain fairly rangebound into the holidays, the relative lack of liquidity and dwindling participants are likely to see some exaggerated price moves within those ranges over the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Expectation of an imminent agreement on a stability pact for Europe's monetary union and next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting could also provide some year-end volatility.</p>
<p>&quot;But at this time of year, the currency markets are just not interested,&quot; said the Japanese bank dealer.</p>
