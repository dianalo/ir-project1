<p>Asian countries offered a muted response to the fall of Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Tuesday, with most countries saying her sacking by the nation's president would not alter bilateral ties.</p>
<p>Senior officials from India, Pakistan's neighbour and sometime foe, described Bhutto's firing as an internal affair. One said the move appeared to have the blessing of the army which, he added, opposed a militarist approach to New Delhi.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically the situation will not affect us in any important way,&quot; an interior ministry said.</p>
<p>In a blistering indictment of Bhutto's rule, Pakistan President Farooq Leghari accused her government of corruption, undermining the judiciary and failing to stop extrajudicial killings in Karachi and elsewhere. He appointed an interim prime minister and ordered elections on February 3.</p>
<p>Japan, Pakistan's main aid donor for years, said it was waiting for the situation to become clearer before commenting.</p>
<p>&quot;We are waiting until the situation becomes clearer before issuing a statement,&quot; a foreign ministry spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Japan has been providing just over half of the total foreign aid received by Pakistan. In 1996, it extended $542 million in loans to Pakistan, mainly yen grants for development projects, and about $70 million in direct aid, Japanese officials said.</p>
<p>Senior members of an Indian delegation in Zimbabwe with Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda told an Indian news agency the sacking was an internal affair.</p>
<p>But one official source in the delegation told India's Asian News International (ANI) agency the democratic process had been &quot;clearly thwarted&quot; with the government's dismissal.</p>
<p>Most other regional countries had no immediate response.</p>
<p>A foreign ministry spokesman in Bangladesh, which won its independence from Pakistan in 1971, said: &quot;It's an internal matter of Pakistan. We are watching developments... but they have nothing to do with our bilateral relations with Islamabad.&quot;</p>
<p>South Korea's relations with Pakistan were unlikely to be affected, government sources in Seoul said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no plan to issue an official comment on the dismissal... since it is Pakistan's internal political matter,&quot; a foreign ministry official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not expecting any impact by the situation on the relationship between two countries,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>South Korean industry sources said investments would also not be affected by the sacking. Trade between South Korea and Pakistan currently totals $600 million.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it will not affect us in any way,&quot; said a spokesman with Daewoo Corp, which has won some $1.15 billion worth of construction deals from the Pakistan government.</p>
<p>But the upheaval may not be without impact.</p>
<p>Indonesian palm oil traders expressed concern, saying it could hit future sales to the country, a significant importer of palm oil from both Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be extra cautious when dealing with private Pakistani buyers because problems over payments could arise if there is unrest there,&quot; one senior trader said.</p>
<p>The dismissal could also have important ramifications for Afghanistan's Taleban militia, now locked in war with a northern alliance, Afghan watchers said.</p>
<p>They said despite Islamabad's regular denials of any support to any factions in Afghanistan's civil war, few people in Kabul doubted that Pakistani support for the Taleban was wide-ranging.</p>
<p>&quot;Politically and militarily, Bhutto's government has stood firmly beside the Taleban. The evidence is overwhelming,&quot; said one veteran Afghan watcher who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are all going to be looking at now is whether the divisions within the Pakistani establishment over Afghan policy will come into the open now that Benazir has gone,&quot; he said. Pakistan has consistently denied it provides military or other support to the Taleban, saying it has no favourites among Afghan factions, most of whom it helped during the struggle against Soviet occupation in the 1980s.</p>
