<p>China must ensure that the state buys all grain that farmers want to sell this year and that funds for the purchases are not misused, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Local governments must protect the interests of farmers in a year that is expected to show a bumper harvest, the China Daily quoted him as saying on Thursday.  </p>
<p>China has forecast a record grain harvest of 475 million tonnes this year, up from a record 466 million tonnes last year.</p>
<p>Zhu, who was speaking at an agricultural conference in the northeastern city of Dalian, said sufficient storage facilities must be made available.</p>
<p>Temporary storage facilities in factories or material supplies departments should be utilised. Investment would be increased to ensure sufficient storage facilities over the longer term.</p>
<p>Railways, highways and waterways should give priority to grain shipments during the harvest season, he said.</p>
<p>Farmers could not be given IOUs and officials or government departments that failed to make payments to farmers for purchased grain would be dealt with severely.</p>
<p>He quoted figures from an audit of 100 counties that showed 30 percent of funds set aside for grain purchases were misused in 1995. The figure had risen to 40 percent this year, he said.</p>
<p>Zhu said contracted grain should be purchased at the contracted prices, even if market prices fall below this level, to ensure that farmers do not suffer economic losses. Differences between the two price levels would be made up through state subsidies, he said.</p>
