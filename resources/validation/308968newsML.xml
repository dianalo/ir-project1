<p>FCOJ futures slumped as concerns about cold weather damaging the Florida citrus belt eased, traders said, but one forecaster warned against a &quot;freeze scare&quot; in the northern part of the region over the coming weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;We still see cold weather coming in but there is no reported call for a freeze, and in view of that we saw a setback in the market,&quot; FCOJ specialist Celeste Georgakis of Dean Witter Reynolds said.</p>
<p>&quot;The fundamentals continue to be bearish and that puts a lid on prices,&quot; Georgakis added.</p>
<p>March orange juice settled 2.60 cents weaker at 79.75 cents per pound, traded 82.00 to 79.20 cents. Volume was estimated at 3,500 lots compared to Tuesday's official 3,743 lots.</p>
<p>Weather forecaster Jon Davis of Smith Barney said the cold airmass moving down the country from Canada needed to be watched as it reached Florida's citrus belt.</p>
<p>&quot;In the very least, it is a freeze scare. Based on guidance this morning it looks like the coldest morning with this Arctic surge will be Sunday morning,&quot; Davis said. Lows across the citrus belt will be 28-35 (Farenheit) range.</p>
<p>&quot;Some minor fruit damage is possible in the northern portion of the belt,&quot; Davis said, adding that about half the crop had already been harvested. The southern part of the belt was safe from any damage.</p>
