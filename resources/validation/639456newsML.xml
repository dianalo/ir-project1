<p>The Namibian government plans to restructure its stock issues as a way to create a liquid secondary debt market, Finance Minister Nangolo Mbumba said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry of Finance is considering (restructuring) the composition and maturities of existing government registered stock, so as to enhance the marketability and tradability of these instruments and to create more liquidity in the market,&quot; Mbumba said on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>&quot;The time is right to start the process of establishing a secondary market for government debt,&quot; he told the fifth anniversary dinner of the Namibian Stock Exchange (NSE).</p>
<p>&quot;In the domestic market treasury bills and government stocks are issued in...a captive market where the demand for securities exceeds the supply by wide margins,&quot; Mbumba said.</p>
<p>He called on financial market players to come up with concrete proposals on how best Namibia could develop its capital markets and the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have to prepare our own capital market to be able to compete with all other international financial markets to get local investment money to stay in Namibia,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Gradual easing of foreign exchange controls on the Namibian dollar -- currently linked to the South African rand -- and a privatisation programme would also boost the financial sector now that the NSE had bedded down.</p>
<p>NSE general manager Tom Minney said part of the exchange's success could be attributed to allowing dual listings and providing for a 35 percent Namibian asset requirement for insurance companies and pension funds.</p>
<p>&quot;The government wanted to put some of this money back into the country and we wanted liquidity in the market,&quot; he told the dinner.</p>
<p>&quot;With major listings last year and this year, (investors) are beginning to see that the market is liquid enough, which is definitely a problem with a lot of the African markets,&quot; Minney said.</p>
<p>Local market capitalisation rose from N$695 million ($155 million) in 1994 to N$3.2 billion ($714.3 million) currently.</p>
<p>Dual listings bring the total to 30 listing with a total market capitalisation of N$150 billion ($33.5 billion).</p>
<p>That ranks it second in Africa after the Johannesburg exchange, but it is still dwarfed by the South African market, which is capitalised at around 1,200 billion rand ($268 billion).</p>
<p>Several major South African companies are dual-listed on the Johannesburg and Namibian exchanges, including Barlows, De Beers and First National Bank .</p>
