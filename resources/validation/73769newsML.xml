<p>Spain will prepare an austere 1997 budget that makes it a contender for the European single currency launch, but experts fear that much-needed structural reforms promised by the government may be scant.</p>
<p>The Spanish debt market seems convinced the government will deliver a stringent budget to parliament on Monday, and, consequently, the spread versus Bunds has narrowed to 189 basis points from 246 at the end of August.(Bond buyers now expect to earn an extra 1.89 percent off their Spanish investment than they would from German bonds, the spread, instead of the 2.46 percent more they expected earlier. This is a measure of confidence that will be reflected in higher bond prices.)</p>
<p>&quot;Structural measures are missing (in the budget) although this doesn't seem to be a key factor for the markets,&quot; said Carmen Hernansanz, analyst at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>The Bank of Spain has been insisting on structural reforms that diminish long-term expenditure as a priority measure if durable and stable fiscal consolidation is to be achieved.</p>
<p>The government has pledged to present to parliament on Monday a stringent budget to cut the deficit in 1997 to gross domestic product to three percent from the 4.4 percent forecast this year.</p>
<p>But economists fear the cuts will just be one-off and will not trigger the necessary long-term reduction in expenditure.</p>
<p>&quot;(The budget) should take in structural measures on health etc and should introduce others that help to create trends. This would give more credibility to the budget. The accounts add up, but they must break down barriers,&quot; said Carmen Alcaide, head of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya's economic research department.</p>
<p>Analysts were perplexed by what looked like government backpedalling on issues such as health spending or infrastructure financing after testing the waters with various plans.</p>
<p>Social security is one area which makes it particularly difficult to rein in the budget.</p>
<p>The central government spent some 4.5 percent of gross domestic product, or 3.1 trillion pesetas ($24.31 billion), on the item in 1995. An aging population suggests this figure may swell, overshooting the government's deficit target this year.</p>
<p>The social security deficit is forecast at 0.3 percent of GDP this year and 0.2 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;We think they won't hit the deficit target this year, or next. The main problem will be social security,&quot; said Hernansanz, who estimated that the social security gap could be bloated by 0.6 percentage points to 0.9 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>The government insists that the budget will allow Spain entry into the first group of nations heading European Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.</p>
<p>In order to do this, spending has to be adjusted by 1.2 trillion pesetas via a forecast 800 billion peseta cut in expenditure and a 400 billion peseta increase in revenues.</p>
<p>The government has said it expects spending in 1997 to grow by around 2.4 percent and income by six percent in nominal terms. Inflation is forecast at 2.6 percent and GDP growth is seen at three percent next year.</p>
<p>&quot;In my opinion the key to this issue is the 10 percent cut in government spending on goods and services and the six percent growth in income, which is a very credible forecast,&quot; said Alfonso Novales of Eriste research.</p>
<p>&quot;(But) neither this 10 percent reduction, nor a public sector wage freeze nor the fall in public investment for the third year running are structural measures,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There are also other worries overhanging the budget, such as the possible cost of the new regional financing system or whether a projected 600 billion pesetas of income will be raised from privatisations, said Ramon Forcada, Ibersecurities analyst.</p>
<p>Given these worries, no-one was ruling out &quot;window-dressing&quot; measures as a few analysts saw in the French budget.</p>
<p>&quot;If France is allowed to square up its books this year, why won't they let us too?,&quot; said one analyst. ($1=127.5 Peseta)</p>
