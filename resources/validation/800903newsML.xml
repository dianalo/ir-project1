<p>New Zealand share prices ended firmer on Thursday but off their intraday highs in a market which remains cautious ahead of key U.S. data.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index closed 5.68 points stronger at 2,456.60, with Telecom up four cents at NZ$7.42. The top-40 index peaked at 2,465.45 during the session.</p>
<p>&quot;It got sold down this afternoon, but I just think looking at the close there's definitely a little bit more confidence around,&quot; said Luke Koekoek at brokers JB Were and Son.  </p>
<p>He said U.S. consumer price data due out tonight NZ time would set the tone for both U.S. and New Zealand equities in the short-term, but noted a positive bias in the local market.</p>
<p>&quot;It's obviously a big night tonight in the States, but looking at the market I would have thought that in most leading issues the support is definitely weighted to the buy side rather than the offer side.</p>
<p>&quot;If all is okay tonight in the U.S., I think this market will continue to firm up a bit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Big movers on the day were Tranz Rail, up 30 at $8.60, and ANZ Bank, which gained 40 cents to $11.70.  </p>
<p>Brokers said Tranz Rail ADRs had leapt higher overnight on speculation is was closing in on Australian railway assets, while ANZ was benefiting from a general rally in Australian banking stocks.</p>
