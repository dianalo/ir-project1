<p>The British economy grew faster than originally reported in the last two quarters and growth in 1994 and 1995 was also revised up, according to official figures published on Friday.</p>
<p>Economists said the figures suggested there was less spare capacity in the economy than previously thought and provided further evidence that interest rates would need to rise to prevent surging demand from pushing up inflation.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.9 percent in the first quarter of this year, while the annual growth rate was revised up to 3.1 percent from 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>Growth in the fourth quarter of 1996 was revised up to 2.9 percent year-on-year from the 2.6 percent originally reported.</p>
<p>The ONS said latest estimates showed the economy had grown by a robust 4.5 percent in 1994, well above the 4.0 percent last reported, and by 2.8 percent in 1995 instead of 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The upward revisions to previous years' data have left the level of GDP about one percent higher than previously estimated,&quot; said Jonathan Loynes, an economist at HSBC Markets.</p>
<p>&quot;It will doubltess rekindle fears that the official figures are once again understating the true strength of the current upturn.&quot;</p>
<p>He was referring to the so-called &quot;Lawson boom&quot; of the late 1980s, when then Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) Nigel Lawson cut both interest rates and taxes as official statistics suggested the economy needed a stimulus.</p>
<p>In fact, growth subsequently proved to have been much stronger than the authorities realised.</p>
<p>The Conservative government drastically increased interest rates as inflation went into double figures, triggering Britain's longest post-war recession.</p>
<p>However, Loynes said the most recent figures gave a mixed picture of the current strength of the economy, with consumer spending less robust in the first quarter than previously estimated and investment revised down sharply.</p>
<p>Real personal disposable income unexpectedly fell in the first quarter and consumers dipped into their savings to fund spending.</p>
<p>&quot;The upward revisions to previous years' data are worrying but the figures for the first quarter reveal few signs that the domestic economy is on the verge of overheating,&quot; Loynes said.</p>
<p>&quot;Accordingly, while interest rates are still likely to rise after the budget -- barring a very large increase in personal taxes -- the size of the hike needed is relatively modest and we do not envisage rates ending the year higher than 7.0 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>Interest rates have been raised twice in the last two months to their present level of 6.5 percent.</p>
<p>The extent of any further increases by the Bank of England's new monetary policy committee, empowered by the Labour government to set interest rates, could depend on whether Chancellor Gordon Brown raises personal taxes to dampen consumer spending in his first budget on July 2.</p>
<p>Rob Hayward, an economist at Bank of America, noted that consumer spending remained the driving force in the economy and that the savings ratio -- the proportion of disposable income which people save -- had dropped to 10.4 percent in the first quarter from 11.4 percent in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;The savings ratio is an indication of consumer confidence, where people are more inclined to spend than save,&quot; he said. &quot;Consumer spending is likely to remain very robust right the way through the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Other figures showed an unexpectedly large current account surplus of 1.459 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) in the first quarter, the largest surplus since the start of 1993 and almost three times the fourth quarter figure of 508 million.</p>
<p>There were large surpluses on services and investment income but earnings from travel slipped slightly, suggesting the stronger pound might be deterring tourists. ($ = 0.600 British Pounds)</p>
