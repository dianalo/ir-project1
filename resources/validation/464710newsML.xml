<p>The Thai baht was weaker against the dollar in late trade on Monday as the U.S. unit rebounded abroad and amid high market liquidity, dealers said.</p>
<p>The baht eased to 25.961/25.964 to the dollar near the close from 25.25.943/25.953 in early morning, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect more buying of the dollar tomorrow. The dollar is likely to strengthen further and the liquidity is very high,&quot; said one dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand fixed the mid-rate at 25.94 per dollar against 25.97 on Friday.  </p>
<p>The one-month baht/dollar swap premium was quoted at 7.75/8.50 satangs late compared with 8.00/9.00 in early morning.</p>
<p>Rising liquidity pushed the overnight interbank rate down sharply to 6.00 percent in late trade from 7.50-8.00 in the morning, dealers said.</p>
<p>The interbank rate of 6.00 percent wass the lowest level since August 22, 1996 when the interbank rate was at 4.50-5.00.</p>
<p>Dealers said the ample money supply was attributed to the gradual entry of some funds from the Government Pension Fund (GPF) which is scheduled to be luanched this Thursday.  </p>
<p>The market expects about 80 billion baht ($3 billion) Government Pension Fund (GPF) would enter the financial system after the launch.</p>
<p>Thai central bank governor Rerngchai Marakanond said on Monday his bank would monitor the Thai money market and its sharply rising liquidity this week to prevent sharp swings of domestic interest rates.</p>
