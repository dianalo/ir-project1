<p>Serbian opposition activists said on Tuesday they were certain that weeks of protests had forged a well-drilled machine that could beat President Slobodan Milosevic in the fight for control of local councils.</p>
<p>The protests, now in their fifth week, began as clumsy, disorganised and spontaneous gatherings that took the newly formed opposition coalition Zajedno by surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;We had no idea the protests would last even a week,&quot; said spokesman Slobodan Vuksanovic. &quot;We were not prepared for it and it took us a bit of time to get things together, but now we are on a roll.&quot;</p>
<p>In the coalition headquarters, a huge sign reads &quot;DAY 30&quot; for the number of days protesters have jammed the streets of Belgrade demanding that Milosevic recognise opposition victories in local elections held over four weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;That is like a pressure-gauge,&quot; said a party volunteer named Goran. &quot;Every day the number goes up, so does the pressure on Milosevic to give us back our democracy.&quot;</p>
<p>The sign which dominates the main meeting room in the coalition offices has become a rallying point for the minions that answer phones and photocopy press releases.</p>
<p>&quot;In the beginning it was very chaotic, but now instead of getting harder as everyone expected, it gets easier. We don't even need to think up new ideas to get the people on the streets -- Milosevic does that for us,&quot; said party worker Jela Jovanovic. &quot;Now we can see he is starting to panic.&quot;</p>
<p>Over the past week the state-controlled courts ruled that Zajedno should be given control of two disputed towns -- the first signs of a judicial back-down.</p>
<p>Milosevic on Friday also published an open letter to the U.S. defending his actions. Sunday's demonstrations drew a record quarter of a million people onto the streets in what Zajedno said was the public's response.</p>
<p>And unions -- traditionally pillars of government support -- have backed the protests and launched their own demonstration outside the Serbian parliament demanding democracy, unpaid wages and workers' rights.</p>
<p>Zajedno volunteers said each development was a small but vital inspiration for them.</p>
<p>&quot;It is like we have been locked in a sealed room, and each time something happens like the court rulings, it opens a crack and lets more oxygen in,&quot; said Emilijan Djindjic, a law student related to one of the opposition party leaders, Zoran Djindjic.</p>
<p>Another student, who would only give his name as Ratsa, picked up the theme: &quot;It is also like an earthquake shaking Milosevic's castle. Now we can see the not just cracks but pieces starting to fall off it. We will keep marching until the walls fall down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I really don't see how we can lose now. It is just a question of time, and time is definitely on our side,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The volunteers believe they are witnessing Serbia's own popular revolution that has unified blue and white collar workers, professionals and students for the fist time.</p>
<p>And most conceded it was hard not to get drawn into the excitement of the daily carnival in which about 100,000 supporters march through the streets amid a cocophany of bands, whistles, trumpets and candles.</p>
<p>But privately one volunteer cautioned against complacancy.</p>
<p>&quot;It is all very intoxicating, especialy when the crowd gathers outside our window every day and we start playing rock music for them.&quot; she said. &quot;But we must not forget that although Milosevic is seriously damaged, he is still in power and he still controls everything. It is not over yet.&quot;</p>
