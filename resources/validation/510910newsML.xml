<title>UK: Gold slides, seen probing support at $345.</title>
<headline>Gold slides, seen probing support at $345.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-15</dateline>

<p>Gold struggled to keep composed above $345 an ounce on Tuesday but sentiment was loosening and dealers expected support to come under critical test.</p>
<p>&quot;Pressure does seem to be on the downside. People are disappointed that the market hasn't performed better given the sell-off in the equities,&quot; said one London dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;I think quite possibly the market is looking to test that level ($345). Whether it holds it I don't know,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Bullion fixed lower at $345.60 an ounce versus Monday's $346.75 and New York's close of $346.00/$346.50.</p>
<p>It has been under pressure since Friday following strong U.S. inflation data pointing to interest rate hikes, which increases the opportunity cost of holding gold against the dollar.</p>
<p>Further clues on inflation will be provided on Tuesday with U.S. March Consumer Price Index (CPI) due at 1230 GMT.</p>
<p>Opinion differed however on whether $345 would act as a buffer, or trigger sell stops and force bullion down to $340.</p>
<p>&quot;The $345 area is critical support, but I think it will bounce,&quot; said technical analyst Karen Jones of Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
<p>Others, though, including analyst Martin Squires of broker Rudolf Wolff believed that gold had lower to go.</p>
<p>&quot;A descending triangle is developing...suggesting further downside movements can be expected,&quot; he said, referring to New York's April Comex gold futures contract.</p>
<p>Brokers GNI thought hot money could pour into gold from currency markets if the dollar began to look a bit toppy.</p>
<p>&quot;In the very short term, there could be a lot of dollar longs looking to take profit, and there could easily be a quick bounce in the stock market which may make gold ripe for a brief bounce as well. But do not expect it to be more than a few dollars or to last very long,&quot; it said in a daily market commentary.</p>
<p>Palladium fell from grace after last week's spike above $160, and was quoted unchanged on the day at $151.25/$152.25.</p>
<p>But the market was still prone to sharp fluctuations while it awaited news from Russia, the world's biggest exporter, on delayed PGM (platinum group metals) sale contracts to Japan.</p>
<p>No word has yet emerged after last week's comments by a Russian official that a long-awaited government decree would be signed this week, enabling exports to begin some time in May.</p>
<p>Silver was also flat at 4.72/$4.74, but in the absence of buying interest the market could suffer further liquidation by disappointed longs and probe the $4.65 low, analysts said.</p>
