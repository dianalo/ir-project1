<p>Argentine industrial output in June rose 9.8 percent against the same month last year while output in the first half of 1997 was 7.9 percent higher than first-half 1996, the Economy Ministry said.</p>
<p>June's output was a seasonally-adjusted 0.9 percent above May's and a non seasonally-adjusted 1.4 percent below May.  </p>
<p>&quot;With this data, we have had 15 months of uninterrupted positive behaviour in monthly figures compared with the same month last year,&quot; said the Economy Ministry in a statement.</p>
<p>The second-quarter production increase was 8.3 percent against second-quarter 1996, following the first quarter's 7.5 percent increase.</p>
<p>The biggest growth in output for the first six moths of the year was for agrochemicals and car exports, as well as car tyre production. The ministry also reported sustained growth for the construcion industry and its main supplies -- cement, iron and metawork.</p>
<p>Synthetic and artificial fiber output also showed good gains on Mercosur commerce, the ministry said.</p>
<p>The accompanying survey of expectations of the industrial sector showed 56.2 percent of companies expect an increase in domestic demand in the third quarter of 1997, compared with third quarter last year. In contrast 36.8 percent expect no change and seven percent expect demand to drop.</p>
<p>Nearly a quarter of those polled expected use of imported supplies to increase, with 63.1 percent seeing no rise and 12.3 percent expecting a fall.</p>
<p>Asked about the prospects for usage of installed apacity, 35.6 percent expected it to rise and 59.4 percent expected to make new investments this quarter.</p>
