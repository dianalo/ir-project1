<p>German shares notched up more records on Thursday as the blue chip DAX shrugged off Wall Street losses to reach an all-time high close, but profit-taking took the edge off the market's advance.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX, catching up with a post-bourse surge on Wednesday, ended the floor session up 6.78 points at 3,805.29 points, firmly above the key psychological threshold of 3,800, but off an intraday session high of 3,827.52 points.</p>
<p>But the index fell back from its level in after-hours trade the previous day, when the IBIS DAX rose to 3,819.52 points on a wave of liquidity before the close of the second quarter.</p>
<p>Prices picked up again late on Thursday amid fresh interest in car stocks and sent the IBIS DAX index to a flat close of 3,820.16 points, up 0.64 points.</p>
<p>&quot;This was profit-taking, nothing more,&quot; said a Frankfurt dealer of the loss of upward momentum. &quot;The outlook still looks positive, but things are just slowing down.&quot;</p>
<p>Sixteen DAX stocks declined in bourse trade while 14 advanced.</p>
<p>Profit-taking on bank shares, the hot favourites of the past two days, had the most impact.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG was down 1.70 marks at 102.60 and ended IBIS at 102.10 marks while Commerzbank AG slipped 25 pfennigs to 50.20 marks in bourse and dropped to 49.94 marks in late trade.</p>
<p>Electronics and engineering giant Siemens also slipped 1.95 marks to 105.65 marks in bourse trade, ending IBIS at 105.55.</p>
<p>Leading the  advancing shares was industrial giant and DAX index heavyweight Daimler-Benz AG, which rose five marks or around four percent to 142 marks and ended IBIS at 142.25 after announcing plans to sell its stake in computer unit Cap Gemini.</p>
<p>The move was viewed as a strategic plus for Daimler, which has shed many non-core businesses in a bid to boost its profitability. Analysts also welcomed news that the company appears to remain keen on the information technology segment.</p>
<p>Volkswagen AG clocked up a gain of nearly five percent as it spurted ahead in later trade, fuelled in part by a reaffirmation of a strong buy recommendation by Merrill Lynch. The shares ended the late IBIS session at 1,311 marks.</p>
<p>Shares in Deutsche Telekom were down 40 pfennigs at 42.50 marks, ending IBIS at 42.54, as the market reacted with broad indifference to news that a deal had been reached with the government to transfer Telekom shares to a state development agency.</p>
<p>The deal was in line with expectations, dealers said.</p>
