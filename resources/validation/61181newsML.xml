<headline>Mexico peso closes firm after slight drop in rates.</headline>

<p>Mexico's peso ended below the key 7.50 per dollar level Wednesday for the first time in weeks, helped by expectations that interest rates have hit a short-term floor after a slight drop on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was calm, the peso firmed up at low trading volume, helped by recognition that interest rates cannot fall further,&quot; a peso trader said. A steady U.S. Treasuries market also helped the Mexican currency, he added.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso closed one centavo firmer at 7.4900/7.4950 per dollar, while 24-hour contracts also closed one centavo up at 7.4880/7.4910 per dollar.</p>
<p>Mexico's bellwether 28-day Cetes, or T-bill, rate fell by just eight basis points to 23.38 percent at the primary auction.</p>
<p>&quot;Cetes fell no further because the market is beginning to discount a 25 basis point hike in rates at the next Fed meeting,&quot; a trader said. &quot;If this happens, the peso could return to a range of 7.52-7.55 per dollar.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders also said that the peso was shored up by a modest stream of foreign investors selling dollars to buy peso-denominated securities on the Mexican stock market, whose leading indicator was some 12 points up at 3,365 points as the exchange market was closing.</p>
<p>The same-day peso closed earlier 1.5 centavos firmer at 7.4800/7.4850 per dollar.</p>
<p>Traders estimated that the same-day peso may test resistance at 7.48 per dollar on Thursday.</p>
<p>The 48-hour peso may weaken, as contracts settled on Thursday will not mature until after the weekend. This leads to demand for dollars which do not have to be paid for until Monday, with pesos that can be invested over the weekend.</p>
