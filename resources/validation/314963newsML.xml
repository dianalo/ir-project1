<headline>ADM may continue in govt programs -- USDA.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-01-17</dateline>

<p>The U.S. Agriculture Department Friday said Archer Daniels Midland Co may continue to do business with the government despite the company's recent guilty plea to price-fixing charges.</p>
<p>As a condition to continue to participate in federal programs, ADM signed an agreement giving USDA access to company records to ensure managers are warned against violating antitrust laws and setting company policies to follow the law.</p>
<p>USDA also said it suspended three former ADM officials from government contracts pending the outcome of indictments. They are Michael D. Andreas, Terrance Wilson and Mark Whitacre.  </p>
<p>ADM plead guilty in October to two counts of fixing the prices of lysine, a feed additive, and citric acid, a food additive, and agreed to pay a record $100 million in fines.</p>
<p>Grant Buntrock, a high level USDA manager, said ADM did not violate any USDA regulations. By law, agencies can bar companies from government contracts if they break federal law.</p>
<p>&quot;ADM approached us to determine what would be needed for ADM to demonstrate its present responsibility to continue doing business with the government and this agreement followed,&quot; Buntrock said in a statement.  </p>
<p>The three-year agreement calls for ADM to establish an education and compliance program that would:</p>
<p>-- establish a corporate code of conduct and compliance policy;</p>
<p>-- establish an antitrust compliance guide;</p>
<p>-- distribute the code and antitrust guides to marketing and sales employees;</p>
<p>-- require employees to certify they will obey federal law and ADM policies;</p>
<p>-- mandate annnual ethics and antitrust training seminar.  </p>
<p>Michael Andreas is ADM's former executive vice president and the son of ADM chairman Dwayne Andreas. Wilson is a former ADM vice president who headed the corn-processing unit. Whitacre was a former ADM vice president and the chief government informant in the antitrust probe of the agribusiness giant.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a federal grand jury handed up a sweeping 45-count criminal indictment against Whitacre that accused him of stealing more than $9 million from the company.</p>
<p>ADM has said it does less than $67 million in business with the government. The Decatur, Ill.-based company had revenue over $13.3 billion last year.</p>
<p>ADM products are used in the government's Food for Peace and Food for Progress programs, which donate or aid food sales overseas, and in school lunch and food for the elderly programs domestically.</p>
<p>The company sells corn byproducts and corn/soybean blends to the government which are used as high nutrition products in feeding programs overseas. It also sells soybean oil, sunflower oil, wheat flour and bulgar to the government, industry sources said.</p>
