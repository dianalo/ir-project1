<p>Pakistan's Corporate Law Authority (CLA) has told the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) to restructure its board of directors so that at least one third of them should be non-brokers, the CLA chairman said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Shamim Ahmed Khan told Reuters the KSE had been asked on Wednesday to amend its rules of association by July 31 to incorporate the changes sought by the authority.</p>
<p>&quot;The governing Board of the Directors of the stock exchanges should be restructured to enable induction of at least 33 percent outside non-broker members on the board, representing the interest of the public, to be nominated by the Corporate Law Authority,&quot; a CLA directive to the KSE said.</p>
<p>Khan said the CLA had asked the exchange to appoint a full-time professional non-broker as chief executive officer with the approval of the Corporate Law Authority.</p>
<p>Khan said similar instructions would soon be sent to the Lahore Stock Exchange and the Islamabad Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;The CLA has initiated the process of major restructuring of the stock exchanges which should modernise the infrastructure of the market,&quot; he said. &quot;These measures are aimed at modernising the stock exchanges and making them more transparent and responsive to the interest of the general public,&quot; Khan added.</p>
<p>The CLA has told the KSE to reduce the number of elected board members to 12 from 15 and add four CLA nominees.</p>
<p>No comment from Karachi stock exchange officials was immediately available.</p>
