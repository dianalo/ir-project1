<headline>Serbian opposition starts anti-election protest.</headline>
<dateline>BELGRADE 1996-11-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tens of thousands of opposition supporters began marching through the centre of Belgrade in freezing weather on Wednesday to campaign against a re-run of local elections they say they have already won.</p>
<p>The marchers moved towards the state parliament building, retracing the route that similar protests have taken each day since local electoral commissions cancelled opposition victories in local elections ten days ago.  </p>
<p>Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition which won elections in 15 of the 18 biggest towns in Serbia, marched at the head of the column which observers said was bigger than Tuesday's crowd of 40,000.</p>
<p>The march came on the day the local electoral commissions nominated for the re-run of the disputed local elections, despite electoral laws which prohibit political demonstrations and meetings on polling day.</p>
<p>Zajedno had called for a boycott in Belgrade of Wednesday's third round of voting, which it called a &quot;farce&quot; devised to seal results of poll fraud.</p>
<p>Wednesday's march headed towards the state television studios and were expected to proceed to the Politika news paper offices -- both controlled by president Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party -- where earlier protests had pelted the buildings with eggs and abuse.</p>
