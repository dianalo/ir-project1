<p>A minister from the pro-Western flank of Turkey's government on Friday challenged his coalition partners to block planned anti-Islamist measures in a growing rift within the administration.</p>
<p>Trade and Industry Minister Yalim Erez said Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's Islam-based Welfare Party had to go along with a crackdown on religious activism demanded by the military-dominated National Security Council (NSC).</p>
<p>&quot;The NSC decisions will be enforced to the letter. If there is anyone who is trying to stop that let them come forward and try,&quot; Anatolian news agency quoted Erez as saying.</p>
<p>A leading Welfare MP said earlier this week that his party was not obliged to carry out the measures, which include enforcing a ban on Islamic dress and restricting religious education.</p>
<p>Health Minister Yildirim Aktuna, a member with Erez of the secularist True Path Party, cast doubt on Thursday on the future of the government because of the row. His comments helped push Istanbul shares down by 4.49 percent at the end of the day but stocks gained 2.25 percent on Friday morning in a recovery.</p>
<p>Aktuna this week ordered provincial governors to ensure public health workers complied with the ban on religious clothing. True Path hold most of the ministries, like education and interior, that have the power to implement the measures.</p>
<p>The secularist dress codes, set by modern Turkey's founder Kemal Ataturk in the 1920s, officially oblige public workers to dress in Western-style clothing -- skirts for women and ties for men -- during working hours.</p>
<p>But Erbakan, Turkey's first Islamist prime minister, wants to relax laws in a bid to increase the role of Islam in public life. His party is particularly sensitive to a military-inspired attempt to reduce the influence of religious secondary schools.</p>
<p>The army, which has staged three coups since 1960, is expected to review the crackdown at a meeting on Monday.</p>
