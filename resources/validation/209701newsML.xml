<p>A former top U.S. diplomat said Friday that U.S. anti-drug policy in Colombia could backfire by hurting private enterprise and ultimately strengthening the country's drug cartels.</p>
<p>Michael Skol, a veteran diplomat who stepped down as deputy assistant secretary of state for Latin America in January, said there was a very real threat that the Clinton administration will decide early next year to impose punitive economic sanctions on Colombia.  </p>
<p>And the sanctions, aimed at pressuring the government of President Ernesto Samper to adopt stronger measures against the drug trade, could punish the private sector more than anyone in the country's drug-tainted government, Skol said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're very worried that if a sanctions regime is not applied intelligently, the anti-drug policy of the U.S. government could wind up hurting the private sector and actually, therefore, helping the drug cartels,&quot; Skol said.</p>
<p>&quot;The private sector is the ally, not the enemy,&quot; he added. &quot;It's part of the solution, not part of the problem.&quot;  </p>
<p>Skol spoke in a telephone interview with Reuters from Washington where he now serves as senior vice president of Diplomatic Resolutions, an international consulting agency.</p>
<p>He also serves as chairman of an organization called the U.S.-Colombia Business Partnership, a lobbying group formally launched earlier this week. Skol said the chief purpose of the group, which represents &quot;large U.S. corporations that do business in Colombia,&quot; was &quot;to promote and defend the private sector relationship between the United States and Colombia.&quot;  </p>
<p>The possible removal of Colombia's U.S. trade preferences and other measures that would hurt the economy have been threatened since last March when Washington -- citing Samper's alleged ties to drug lords -- rendered Colombia a pariah state by including it on a list of countries that have failed to cooperate in the global anti-drug fight.</p>
<p>Skol said Colombia's banking sector, which he credited with having done a great deal to fight money laundering, was especially vulnerable to U.S. sanctions. The cut-flower industry, a mainstay of the economy, could also suffer severely -- and unfairly -- under the sanctions, he said.  </p>
<p>Samper himself has said that sanctions -- aimed at crippling the Colombian economy -- could backfire by forcing a growing number of people to turn to the drug trade for their livelihood.</p>
<p>Skol said he did not support the decertification of Colombia when it was announced on March 1 of last year. But unless Colombia's Congress moves quickly to approve extradition, the seizure of illicit assets, stiffer jail sentences and other penalties against drug trafficking, he said renewed decertification, with economic sanctions, was a certainty.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no way that decertification will not be accompanied by additional sanctions,&quot; he said. &quot;That's going to happen and this time it will hit Colombia hard.&quot;</p>
