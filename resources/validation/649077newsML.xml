<p>Saracens number eight Tony Diprose has been called into the British Lions squad as a replacement for the injured Scott Quinnell, manager Fran Cotton said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Diprose won his first two caps for England in Argentina in the last fortnight and will fly from England on Wednesday to join the squad in Durban on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Diprose played really well all season and had two good tests against Argentina, whose pack is every bit as good as the ones out here in South Africa,&quot; Cotton said.</p>
<p>&quot;We took advice from Mike Catt and Nigel Redman who both said that he had played excellently on the England tour that they had both been called from.&quot;</p>
<p>Quinnell, who has a groin strain was the third Lions player after Paul Grayson and Doddie Weir to go home injured from the tour.</p>
<p>Cotton refused to comment on the fines levied by the Mpumalanga rugby union on locks Elandre van der Bergh and Marius Bosman who were found of guilty of trampling on Rob Wainwright and Doddie Weir in their match last Wednesday. Weir's tour was ended by a Bosman kick to the knee and .</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't spoken to anyone from Mpumalanga and it's up to the local authorities to decide if justice has been done. It's no longer up to me to comment, but I don't think the fines will pay for Doddie Weir's consultancy fees,&quot; Cotton said.</p>
<p>Earlier captian Martin Johnson said the places for the first test side were still up for grabs even though the Lions were likely to name a test strength side to play Natal on Saturday.</p>
<p>He said those picked to play the Gauteng Lions on Wednesday had every chance of being picked for the June 21 test if they put in good performances.</p>
<p>	  Teams for Wednesday:</p>
<p>Gauteng Lions (probable) - 15-Dawie Du Toit, 14-Joe Gillingham, 13-Jannie van der Walt, 12-Hennie le Roux, 11-Pieter Hendricks, 10-Louis van Rensburg, 9-Johan Roux, 8-Warren Brosnihan, 7-Piet Krause, 6-Andre Vos, 5-Bruce Thorne, 4-Kobus Wiese (captain, 3-Kapstock van Greuning, 2-Chris Rossouw, 1-Roberto Grau.</p>
