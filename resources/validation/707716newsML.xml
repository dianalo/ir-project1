<headline>Kashmir leader tells abductors, &quot;Let their men go&quot;.</headline>

<p>Two years after guerrillas kidnapped four Westerners in Kashmir, a separatist leader on Friday stood before the hostages' relatives and pleaded with the militant abductors to &quot;let their men go&quot;.</p>
<p>Umar Farooq, chairman of Kashmir's All Parties Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, issued the appeal during weekly prayers in the main mosque of Srinagar, the biggest city in the Kashmir valley.</p>
<p>&quot;Two years ago on this day an unfortunate incident happened in Kashmir. Al-Faran abducted six Western tourists,&quot; Farooq told worshippers in the 400-year-old Jamia Masjid mosque.</p>
<p>Among the listeners were the wives of two of the hostages, American Donald Hutchings and Briton Keith Mangan, and the sister of a third, Germany's Dirk Hasert, who sat among Kashmiri women with their heads veiled.</p>
<p>&quot;One escaped, another was beheaded. This is not what Islam teaches,&quot; said Farooq, who is the mosque's chief priest.</p>
<p>His father was killed in 1990 in an incident that helped set off a separatist revolt in which the government says some 17,000 people have died. Separatists say more than 50,000 have been killed.</p>
<p>&quot;I strongly appeal to Al-Faran, if they have some sympathy for Kashmiris and Kashmir's freedom struggle, to let their men go,&quot; he said, pointing to the three Western women.</p>
<p>On July 4, 1995, Americans Donald Hutchings and John Childs and Britons Paul Wells and Keith Mangan were kidnapped by Al-Faran militants while trekking in Lidderwat, 115 km (70 miles) from Srinagar, summer capital of India's Jammu and Kashmir state.</p>
<p>Four days later, Childs sneaked away to safety in a pine forest. On the same day, the captors abducted Dirk Hasert and Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe. Ostroe was later beheaded.</p>
<p>Julie Mangan, Hutchings' wife Jane Schelly and Hasert's sister Birgit were dressed in &quot;salwar kameez&quot;, a loose cotton tunic over trousers that is widely worn in Kashmir, Pakistan and northern India.</p>
<p>After the prayers, the three women tied yellow ribbons to the gate of the nearby Dastagir Sahib shrine.</p>
<p>Kashmiri Moslems commonly tie threads to the gates of shrines in hope of receiving blessings and having their needs fulfilled.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish my prayer is answered today,&quot; Schelly said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Julie Mangan and Birgit Hasert tied yellow ribbons around a pine tree on the sprawling lawns of the deserted All Saints Church in Srinagar.</p>
<p>&quot;I still remember you Keith,&quot; Julie whispered while tying the ribbon. &quot;I still wait for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Julie Mangan was with her husband when he was captured but the separatist militants let her go.</p>
<p>The two women arrived in Srinagar earlier in the week and travelled to Magam village, 85 km (53 miles) south of Srinagar.</p>
<p>Two captured guerrillas have told Indian authorities that the four hostages were executed in December 1995, one month after negotiations over their release broke down, and that they were buried in a cave in a forest surrounding Magam.</p>
<p>But several searches using sniffer dogs from Germany failed to turn up any clues about the hostages.</p>
