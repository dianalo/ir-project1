<p>European 80,000 tonne (Aframax) dirty tanker rates fell on Tuesday on an oversupply of vessels and few cargoes, brokers said.</p>
<p>Middle East very large crude carriers also remained depressed, but business was brisk and some brokers said they expected rates to rise.</p>
<p>In the inter-U.K./Cont sector, Aframaxes fell to W92.5 from W97.5 on Monday after remaining steady at W100 for most of last week.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, Aframaxes also dipped to W107.5 from W110, and are now some 17.5 points down from the high of last week, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is plentiful tonnage and few cargoes,&quot; said a North Sea broker. &quot;Aframaxes in the Med are also weaker, so where is the inspiration to come from?&quot;</p>
<p>The cross-Med 130,000 tonne (Suezmax) market, meanwhile, was quiet, with the rate steady for now at W92.5.</p>
<p>Mideast VLCCs remained below the W50 level, except to Japan where they managed to fetch around W50/52.5. Mideast/Singapore and westward VLCCs were fixed around W47.5.</p>
<p>However, the market was active, with some nine or 10 vessels fixed on Monday plus a number of private deals, and brokers said rates were unlikely to stay in the doldrums for much longer.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't see VLCCs staying where they are. They have got to move up on such a lot of activity. There will be a turning point soon, if not this week, next week,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>West Africa/U.S. Gulf VLCCs were steady at W67.5, with Suezmaxes around W92.5, while North Sea/U.S. VLCCs were assessed at about W65 in quiet trade.</p>
<p>In the fuel oil sector, 25,000 tonnes remained depressed at W185 inter-U.K./Cont but edged up to W195/200 in the Med on rising demand and less prompt tonnage, brokers said.</p>
<p>Caribs/upcoast 70,000 tonne crude cargoes dipped to W220 from W225, but remain historically extremely high -- almost 70 points above the average for last year, according to New York-based Rigos Chartering Inc.</p>
<p>Fuel oil 50,000 tonnes remained soft at W162.5. &quot;Unless natural gas stays high, fuel oil will be based on opportune trade...and will stay down this summer,&quot; a U.S. broker said.</p>
