<p>Japanese children returned to school on Monday, ending a vaction ruined by a deadly food poisoning epidemic that swept across the country this summer.</p>
<p>School children from the western city of Sakai, which was hit hardest by the deadly bacteria, assembled in school courtyards to offer a moment of silence for the two children from the city who died in the epidemic.</p>
<p>&quot;I need to apologise to everyone. Many people suffered from eating your favorite school lunches and we lost our dear friends. It ruined the summer vacation. I'm really sorry,&quot; said the principal of one Sakai school.</p>
<p>The O-157 colon bacillus has been found responsible for a widespread food poisoning epidemic in Japan that has killed 11 people and made over 9,500 ill this year.</p>
<p>The government said late last month that the threat from the germ, while still requiring vigilance, appeared to be receding in Sakai, a city near the regional commercial centre of Osaka in western Japan, where over 6,500, mostly school children, came down with the disease.</p>
<p>Health authorities believe school lunches were responsible for the food poisoning in Sakai, but researchers have been unable to pinpoint the exact source of the infection.</p>
<p>The outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation's school lunch programme.</p>
<p>Sakai city officials said they are still unsure when schools will resume serving lunches. Children will bring box lunches when full-day classes start from September 24.</p>
<p>Schools in Tokyo are serving lunches and teachers are warning students to wash their hands carefully before eating.</p>
<p>One elementary school in central Tokyo served curry rice and egg soup -- instead of salad -- for lunch.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope the children can start eating school lunches safely as as soon as possible. People are still worried,&quot; Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters.</p>
<p>As of Sunday, about 40 victims were still in hospital in Sakai, one in critical condition.</p>
