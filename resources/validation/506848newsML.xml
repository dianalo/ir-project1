<title>USA: Dollar climbs on interest rate outlook.</title>
<headline>Dollar climbs on interest rate outlook.</headline>
<text>
<p>NEW YORK, April 14 - The dollar rose on Monday amid expectations that interest rates will remain low in Japan and Europe and move higher in the United States.</p>
<p>But the possibility of central bank intervention to stem the dollar's rise and uncertainty before the release of a crucial inflation report on Tuesday kept the currency from rising even higher.</p>
<p>Remarks by Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita on Monday reaffirmed the view that rock-bottom rates in Japan are not about to turn higher. Matsushita told a group of business leaders in Tokyo that the central bank would continue to conduct monetary policy with an emphasis on strengthening Japan's economic recovery.</p>
<p>In September 1995, the Bank of Japan cut its official discount rate to a record low 0.5 percent to bolster Japan's struggling economy.</p>
<p>&quot;I think what's propelling the dollar just fractionally higher is you're rewarded for owning dollars on a short-term basis by the interest rate differential,&quot; said John McCarthy, senior vice president at ING Capital Markets.</p>
<p>&quot;The general feeling is rates will continue to move up and rates in Europe and Japan are, at best, static for the moment,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>With the dollar trading near its highest level in more than 4-1/2 years against the yen, traders remained wary that the United States and Japan could intervene in the foreign exchange market to prop up the Japanese currency.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Japanese daily Mainichi Shimbun reported that Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told cabinet ministers on Friday that Japan will act in the currency markets when the dollar rises to 127 yen to 128 yen. But when questioned by reporters on Monday, Mitsuzuka denied having mentioned a specific exchange rate.</p>
<p>Indeed, some traders briefly sold dollars on Monday afternoon on news that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the United States would intervene &quot;when it's appropriate and not act when it's not appropriate.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts, however, were careful not to read too much into Rubin's remarks.</p>
<p>&quot;Our own feeling here in New York is that Mr. Rubin is a trader, so he knows the trader's mentality,&quot; said David Ethridge, director of currency analysis at MMS International in North America.</p>
<p>&quot;By stating this kind of 'on-the-one-hand' type of approach, (Rubin) keeps the market guessing,&quot; Ethridge said.</p>
<p>Rubin was formerly a co-chairman of Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Shortly after the impact from the Rubin statements faded from the market, the dollar soared to 1.7310 marks, its highest level in more than three years. Traders attributed the late surge primarily to dollar purchases by a large Wall Street investment bank.</p>
<p>In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 1.7310 marks, up from 1.7205 marks late Friday. The dollar climbed to 126.63 yen from 126.12 yen.</p>
<p>The dollar also climbed to 1.4725 Swiss francs from 1.4610 francs, and to Canadian $1.3995 from C$1.3983. The British pound fell to $1.6205 from $1.6275.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Labour Department will release a widely watched report on consumer price inflation.</p>
<p>Market participants are very sensitive to any signs of higher inflation that could cause the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates again.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect that what people are looking for is for CPI to confirm that growth is still pretty strong and to suggest a rate hike either at the May or July meeting&quot; of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, said Cynthia Cooley, a foreign exchange analyst and trader at United Gulf Bank of Bahrain in Boston.</p>
<p>Fed policy-makers are scheduled to meet on May 20 and again on July 1 and 2. On March 25, the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent.</p>
