<p>Far East base metal dealers said on Friday they were wary about copper's next move on the London Metal Exchange (LME), and felt the red metal should be easier later in the day on mild profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no strength in copper. It will come off a little bit,&quot; said Vinod Kumar, director of Singapore metal company Donald Mcarthy.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it will come down slightly. There were quite a number of people who bought at US$2,240 (a tonne). They'll take the profit and close the position,&quot; said a senior dealer for a foreign metal trading firm here.  </p>
<p>Metal brokers Brandeis said in their daily review that the bounce away from lows at $2,225/30 a tonne &quot;is running into resistance in the $2,280-$2,300 area and thus prices are still favoured to re-test the recent lows&quot;.</p>
<p>But Rodolf Wolff said in its daily report that &quot;technically, we are looking for initial signs of strength to target $2,300 and $2,350 resistance.&quot;</p>
<p>It conceded, however, that copper's recent rise had made it increasingly vulnerable &quot;to downward pressure&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the market is pretty well divided on copper,&quot; one analyst said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's very difficult to predict where copper is going because it is so unstable,&quot; a Japanese trader said.</p>
<p>Three-month copper was seen by the trade at 0230 GMT at around $2,292/97 a tonne against the late quote on the LME of $2,292/94.</p>
<p>Zinc prices, on the other hand, were expected to post further gains on the LME, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Zinc still looks strong. My buyer should have listened to me. I told him it would go up and stay above $1,500,&quot; a dealer said.  </p>
<p>Another dealer said zinc remained &quot;very well-supported. I think it is going to head higher.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More gains are likely with the market targeting $1,550 amid increasing fundamental tightness with support now evident at $1,505, $1,500 and $1,480,&quot; Brandeis said.</p>
<p>Three-month zinc was seen at 0230 GMT at $1,512/17 and then at $1,514/19 a tonne, little changed from the late trade on the LME of $1,515/18 a tonne.</p>
