<p>France's navy evacuated foreign nationals from Sierra Leone's beleaguered capital on Wednesday as Ghana tried to head off a bloody showdown pitting regional giant Nigeria against coup leaders and their rebel allies.</p>
<p>With Nigeria reinforcing there in the name of Sierra Leone's West African neighbours, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit called for the restoration of ousted civilian President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.</p>
<p>Ghana sent a team to try to negotiate a peaceful end to the showdown, which began with a coup on May 25 and turned bloody on Monday after Nigerian gunboats shelled the city and dissident soldiers and rebel allies turned on Nigerian soldiers there.</p>
<p>Ghana's deputy foreign minister, Victor Gbeho, and Brigadier Seth Obeng, chief of staff army headquarters, went to the Monrovia headquarters of the Nigerian-led ECOMOG West African force on Tuesday and were due in Freetown on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a possible sign of hope, a spokesman for the coup leaders said they had freed some 300 Nigerian soldiers, whom they captured on Monday to hold as human shields against air raids. They returned the Nigerians to their Freetown base.</p>
<p>The city remained calm but unpredictable. Witnesses reported rebels out in force and careering round in stolen vehicles.</p>
<p>&quot;If use of force becomes a last resort and is inevitable, it may have to come to that,&quot; U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told reporters during a stopover in London, adding that the coup leaders lacked support at home and abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;How they expect to survive I do not know. I wish they would be sensible and cut their losses and walk away,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Both the military and the negotiated peaceful options are not mutually exclusive,&quot; Ghana's acting communications minister, Kofi Totobi-Quakyi, told state media in Accra.</p>
<p>Sierra Leone, a former British colony racked by civil war since 1991, has suffered three coups in five years. It is one of the world's poorest countries despite a wealth of minerals.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, the new OAU chairman, told the closing session of the summit in his capital Harare that Africa would not tolerate military takeovers in future.</p>
<p>&quot;We unanimously... call for the restoration of the constitutionally elected government (in Sierra Leone),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nigeria's action has produced a mixed response. &quot;This type of operation...could cause further tragedies for the Sierra Leone people,&quot; Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaore told Radio France International at the OAU summit.</p>
<p>Coup leaders put the death toll in the bombardment and fighting at 80. Some hospital sources put the toll higher.</p>
<p>Nigeria sent at least four helicopters packed with heavily armed soldiers to the capital from Liberia on Tuesday.</p>
<p>General Victor Malu, field commander of the West African force, said on Tuesday Nigeria would bring in jet bombers as part of efforts to overturn the May 25 coup by junior officers.</p>
<p>&quot;We agreed a ceasefire...We hope they will respect it because if not, we are building the capacity to carry on the offensive,&quot; Malu told Reuters.</p>
<p>The United States carried out its largest single-day non-combatant evacuation from the city on Tuesday, bringing out 1,261 civilians by helicopter.</p>
<p>The French navy brought out 261 foreign nationals on Wednesday in its second such operation since the coup.</p>
<p>Kabbah, who won 1996 multi-party elections which ended four years of military rule, is in neighbouring Guinea.</p>
<p>The coup leaders accused him of failing to consolidate a peace accord signed last November with rebel leader Foday Sankoh, and of encouraging ethnic conflict.</p>
<p>Sankoh, named vice-chairman in Major Johnny Paul Koromah's ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, is being held in Nigeria. He has told his men to back the coup.</p>
