<p>The September Australian 10-year bond futures contract continues to find support at around 92.930, holding its ground against a weakening U.S. Treasury market and a nervous local short-end.</p>
<p>The contract ended the SYCOM session at 92.945 and unchanged from Wednesday's pit close, although it was repelled once again at around 92.995.</p>
<p>This level is proving a stiff resistance area and a further barrier is expected at 93.015 before the market can re-test last week's 3-1/4 year high of 93.090, analysts said.  </p>
<p>The local short end got a touch of the jitters late on Wednesday after an influential U.S. investment house said in a client circular that it was now neutral on three-year bonds rather than bullish, although still put a further monetary policy easing as a 75 percent chance.</p>
<p>The subsequent sell-off in three-year bonds also filtered to bill futures and saw the September contract wind back to 94.75 before making a partial recovery in SYCOM to 94.80.</p>
<p>While below a recent contract high of 94.92, at the SYCOM close it still equated to a cash rate of 5.20 percent against current 5.5 percent official interest rates.  </p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia holds its monthly board meeting next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. Treasuries succumbed to a late sell-off amid rumoured central bank selling, and despite a successful US$11.5 billion five-year note auction.</p>
