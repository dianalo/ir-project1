<headline>Dupont forecasts higher third-quarter profits.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-26</dateline>

<p>DuPont Co. stock rose Thursday after the big chemical company said its third-quarter profits would be higher than Wall Street estimates.</p>
<p>DuPont shares added $1.50 to $88.625 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange after it said it expected earnings per share for the quarter, excluding non-recurring items, to be at least 10 percent above analysts' average estimate of about $1.45 a share.</p>
<p>&quot;Strong results in the company's upstream petroleum operations are the major factor in this improved outlook,&quot; Chief Executive John A. Krol said in a statement.</p>
<p>DuPont, which plans to report its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 23, said petroleum segment results were expected to exceed last year's third quarter by more than 40 percent, mainly due to higher worldwide crude oil prices.</p>
<p>The company, the nation's largest chemical company, also said a number of chemicals and specialities businesses were expected to contribute to this improvement, most notably agricultural products.</p>
<p>DuPont, which is based in Wilmington, Del., also said it would take a non-recurring after-tax charge of about $50 million, or 9 cents a share, for crop damage claims and legal expenses related to the recall of its Benlate 50 DF fungicide.</p>
