<p>Australian video distributor Network Entertainment Group Ltd announced plans on Tuesday for a A$12 million float, forecasting in its prospectus a doubling of net profit in the current year to June 30, 1997.</p>
<p>Network Chief Financial Officer John Bell, formerly a research director at ABN Amro Hoare Govett, said the group expected expansion into the distribution of videos and multi-media products for rental would help drive profits higher.</p>
<p>Network forecast a net profit in 1996/97 of A$2.67 million, up from A$1.31 million in 1995/96.  </p>
<p>Earlier Network said it would issue six million shares at A$2.00 a share, producing a price/earnings (p/e) ratio on forecast 1996/97 earnings of 12.7 times and a p/e ratio of 25.9 times actual 1995/96 earnings.</p>
<p>Bell said the pricing would be attractive, particularly given the p/e ratios offered in recent small media and entertainment floats. &quot;We believe that the pricing isn't quite so aggressive as some of the other offerings,&quot; he told a news conference announcing the float details.  </p>
<p>Big screen movie theatre operator Cinema Plus Ltd listed early last month at a 26 percent premium to its A$1.00 issue price, which itself represented a p/e ratio of 27.8 times 1996/97 forecast earnings.</p>
<p>The six million shares floated represent about 35 percent of the fully paid issued capital, with Network managing director and chief executive Karl O'Farrell holding 5.6 million shares or 33 percent of the company. O'Farrell set up Network in 1991.</p>
<p>Former Liberal/National coalition leader John Hewson is the Network chairman and Carmel Travers, the former manager of the Ten Network's news division, is a non-executive director.  </p>
<p>Network said it did not plan to pay any dividends in its first year after listing, but that in subsequent years it planned to pay out 20 percent of net profits as dividends.</p>
<p>Network's current core business is centred on the distribution of videos for sale in video rental outlets, supermarkets and department stores.</p>
<p>Network's sales in the video 'sell-through' market had grown 57 percent annually since 1991, compared to the 19 percent industry average growth rate.  </p>
<p>Bell said Network planned to increase its distribution of videos for rental and become more involved in the purchase and distribution of programmes for broadcast on cinema and television.</p>
<p>It would also increase its involvement in the distribution and co-production of multi-media and interactive titles such as CD-ROMs.</p>
<p>Bell said however that Network would be cautious in entering the CD ROM market because of its high production costs and patchy success record.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an area that we're looking at cautiously,&quot; Bell said.  </p>
<p>The offer is fully underwritten by ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, opens on November 6 and is scheduled to close on November 26.</p>
