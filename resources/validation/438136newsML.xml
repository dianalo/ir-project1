<title>THAILAND: Thailand rejects finance firms plea on provisions.</title>
<headline>Thailand rejects finance firms plea on provisions.</headline>

<p>The Bank of Thailand turned down a request by finance firms to cut to 15 percent from 20 percent additional provisions for sub-standard assets, a senior central bank official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The extra provisions are required under a new central bank order issued last week. The finance firms had wanted the new provisioning requirement to be the same as the 15 percent set for commercial banks for sub-standard assets.  </p>
<p>&quot;The current provision rates -- 20 percent for finance firms and 15 percent for banks -- are appropriate. It reflects well the situation in the financial market,&quot; Thirachai Phuvanartnaranubala, director of financial institutions supervision and development, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no plan to change the order the central bank issued last week, at the moment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The central bank, in a move to bolster a finance sector under growing threat from non-performing loans, ordered finance firms and commercial banks to set aside another 20 percent and 15 percent, respectively, in provisions for sub-standard assets, mostly linked to troubled property sector.</p>
<p>The provisions were on the top of existing reserves of 100 percent for doubtful debts.</p>
<p>Thirachai said commercial banks had so far built much higher reserves for troubled debts than finance firms and they also had better bargaining power and higher collateral.</p>
<p>Thirachai said the measure would be painful for finance firms in the short run but would benefit the whole sector in the longer term.</p>
