<title>MALAYSIA: RESEARCH ALERT - Ringgit slump may hit importers.</title>
<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Ringgit slump may hit importers.</headline>

<p>A number of Malaysian companies that rely heavily on imported goods may be hurt by the recent slump in the ringgit against major currencies, Malaysian brokerage house Jupiter Securities said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Most of the companies listed by Jupiter in a research report are involved in the automotive sector which import components from Japan, and may thus lose out if the yen continues to rise against the ringgit.</p>
<p>The ringgit fell to a 33-month low against the dollar early on Tuesday on continued selling by offshore funds.</p>
<p>It has also fallen against other major currencies in the last one month, though it rose against the German deutschemark.</p>
<p>At 0400 GMT, the ringgit was at 2.5540/80 a dollar.</p>
<p>Among companies which would be affected are national carmaker Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd (Proton) and its distributor Edaran Otomobil Nasional Bhd (EON), the Jupiter report said.</p>
<p>Others were auto groups UMW Holdings Bhd and Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd, Jupiter said.</p>
<p>Jupiter said Proton may be hit as about 30 percent of its auto components are yen-denominated.</p>
<p>&quot;Every five percent strengthening of the yen would crimp EPS (earnings per share) by 7.9 percent,&quot; the stockbroker said.</p>
<p>The yen has risen by 1.2 percent against the ringgit since a month ago, from 2.1952/80 per 100 yen on June 13 to 2.2206/31 at the end of Kuala Lumpur trading on July 14. At 0400 GMT, ringgit was at 2.2306/60 per 100 yen.</p>
<p>But Jupiter said it would downgrade its &quot;buy&quot; recommendation on Proton stock &quot;only if the yen is maintained on or above 2.30 per 100 yen level&quot;.</p>
<p>The impact on EON will be minimal as &quot;costs increases are normally passed on to car buyers through increase in car sales price&quot;, the stockbroker said.</p>
<p>UMW Holdings, whose auto parts costs are 60 to 70 percent yen-denominated will also be affected, Jupiter said. The company sells Toyota cars and heavy equipment vehicles.</p>
<p>&quot;Our sensitivity analysis shows that (with) a 10 cent decrease in ringgit against the yen, UMW's profit would reduce by about 30 million ringgit,&quot; Jupiter said.</p>
<p>Analysts forecast UMW to post net profit of around 310 million ringgit for the year ending December 31, 1997.</p>
<p>Tan Chong, which sells Nissan cars, was estimated to have about 40 percent of its auto components in the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>&quot;A five percent increase in the yen would reduce EPS by 4.6 percent,&quot; Jupiter said.</p>
