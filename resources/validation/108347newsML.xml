<p>Prosecutors urged a federal jury on Thursday to find Juan Garcia Abrego guilty of heading the notorious Gulf cocaine cartel, but the defence attacked their case as the product of a U.S. drug war gone haywire.</p>
<p>In a packed, heavily secured courtroom, defence attorney Mike Ramsey said government drug policy amounted to &quot;a second Prohibition&quot; and had done little more than create a huge, self-perpetuating bureaucracy and corrupt the legal system.</p>
<p>&quot;I can leave the courthouse, with my gray hair and business suit, and within 10 blocks and two hours I can have any drug I want,&quot; Ramsey told the eight-man, four-woman jury, which was to decide Garcia Abrego's fate in a case where the stakes are high for the U.S. government.</p>
<p>U.S. drug agents pursued Garcia Abrego for years and pressured Mexico to help. He became a symbol of the government's fight against international drug-trafficking when he was placed on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list.</p>
<p>Ramsey said the government had no evidence linking Garcia Abrego to the Gulf cartel but the drug enforcement bureaucracy brought what he called a &quot;show trial&quot; to court so it could shine the spotlight on itself in this election year.</p>
<p>Garcia Abrego, captured in January in Monterrey, Mexico, and deported to Houston for trial, faces up to life in prison if convicted on 22 drug-related counts. Prosecutors say the Gulf cartel, which he directed from northern Mexico, shipped up to a third of the cocaine consumed in the United States.</p>
<p>But Ramsey said Garcia Abrego was pictured as &quot;the guy that's in charge of the conspiracy that ate the world&quot; just to impress politicians. &quot;They're saying 'We've discovered the key, we've solved the (drug) problem now.' Well, sure.&quot;</p>
<p>In its eagerness to convict Garcia Abrego, he said, the prosecution relied on testimony from former cartel insiders who were willing to lie to get reduced sentences.</p>
<p>It was up to the jury to &quot;wash the stink of hired testimony off our hands&quot; and send a message that the drug enforcement bureaucracy had gone too far by making deals with &quot;crooks, rats, scum,&quot; Ramsey said. &quot;America always wins when the right message is sent.&quot;</p>
<p>Prosecutor Melissa Annis acknowledged that it was cartel insiders who testified but said they had told the truth when they identified him as head of the cartel. She said the government, which put on more than 50 witnesses, had produced a long paper trail that verified all that was said in three weeks of testimony.</p>
<p>&quot;Everbody knew he was the boss. If you work for Exxon, you know who the chairman of the board is,&quot; she said. &quot;This man was responsible, really and truly, for thousands and thousands and thousands of pounds of marijuana and tons and tons -- off the charts -- of cocaine.&quot;</p>
<p>Prosecutor Jesse Rodriguez said Garcia Abrego had ordered the murders of several people viewed as threats to the cartel, including some cartel members, and had bribed public officials to make sure the cocaine shipments got through.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep in mind, the modus operandi of this organisation was 'either join us or die,'&quot; Rodriguez said. &quot;We know from the evidence that he is El Jefe (The Boss), El Senor (The Man).&quot;</p>
<p>But defence attorney Tony Canales said the government had &quot;failed miserably&quot; to prove its case partly because, despite more than three years of wiretapping of the cartel, it had no recordings of Garcia Abrego or even a mention of his name.</p>
<p>&quot;Not one (government agent) said the magic words (during testimony). What were the magic words? I saw, I heard Juan Garcia Abrego on the tapes,&quot; he said.</p>
