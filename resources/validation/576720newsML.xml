<p>An independent evaluation of IGG International Inc's lead carbohydrate-based anti-fungal compound CAN-296 found the product to be very promising, IGG said Monday.</p>
<p>It said Jack Sobel, chief of infectious disease at Harper Hospital and professor of medicine at Wayne State University School of Medicine, had described CAN-296 as a compound with enormous potential.  </p>
<p>&quot;The in vitro activity of CAN-296 is remarkable,&quot; it quoted Sobel as saying in a presentation to the annual general meeting of the American Society for Microbiology. &quot;In these experiments, CAN-296 showed rapid and potent cidal activity against a broad spectrum of fungal species.</p>
<p>&quot;CAN-296 is different because it is fungicidal, kills the fungus, verses most anti-fungal products that only inhibit the growth of fungus, or fungistatic.&quot;</p>
<p>Sobel, who led the independent evaluation, added, &quot;Based on these preliminary results, I believe the clinical potential of CAN-296 is enormous.&quot;</p>
<p>The company, which has a patent pending on the compound, said it plans to develop it for both topical and systemic anti-fungal applications.</p>
<p>CAN-296 is a natural complex carbohydrate that has been extracted from the cell wall of certain fungi.</p>
<p>IGG is a biotechnology company.</p>
