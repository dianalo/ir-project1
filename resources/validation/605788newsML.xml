<p>The Teamsters union has broken off talks for a new contract with United Parcel Service and will honour picket lines if the company's pilots go on strike, the union's president said Thursday.</p>
<p>Teamsters General President Ron Carey said UPS management had refused to negotiate seriously about issues such as subcontracting, full-time job opportunities, better wages and pensions and stronger safety and health protection.</p>
<p>Carey said the Teamsters had told the company: &quot;Until you're serious, we're not going to meet with you.&quot; At a rally outside a UPS distribution centre, he said the package delivery firm was &quot;trying to shift all good full-time jobs to part-time jobs, to lower wages.&quot;</p>
<p>The Teamsters' current contract with UPS, which covers almost 190,000 workers, expires July 31. The union says UPS is shifting some of its best jobs to outside independent contractors. It also says the worker injury rate at UPS was 2 1/2 times higher than the industry average.</p>
<p>Negotiations between UPS and the International Pilots Association, which represents more than 2,000 UPS flight crewmembers, were suspended on May 10 after meetings failed to produce an agreement on compensation and pension issues.</p>
<p>&quot;If the pilots go out, we're going to honour every picket line,&quot; Carey said.</p>
<p>Carey said UPS had gone &quot;backwards&quot; in two months of negotiations. &quot;Everything that they have proposed at this point has been nothing but nonsense,&quot; he told reporters after the rally. &quot;We were wasting our time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The whole concept of trying to negotiate a contract early is so that you can get these problems resolved,&quot; he said. &quot;They've used this as a game.&quot; He said the company had proposed a seven-year contract, while the union prefered a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>The Teamsters said rallies took place Thursday in cities across the United States, Canada, Europe and Brazil.</p>
<p>UPS spokesman Mark Dickens said worker participation had been &quot;lukewarm.&quot; He said the rallies were a &quot;typical union tactic to gain some leverage at the negotiating table.&quot;</p>
<p>Dickens said he &quot;would not even speculate&quot; as to why negotiations with the Teamsters &quot;have been halted temporarily.&quot; He said UPS had never suffered a nationwide work stoppage.</p>
<p>He said UPS needed more part-time workers to keep up with an increase in air express volume. &quot;To process these packages usually requires a significant number of people working for short periods of time,&quot; Dickens said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past three years, we've moved more than 13,000 part-time employees to full-time positions,&quot; he said. Dickens also says no Teamsters jobs have been eliminated because of subcontracting.</p>
<p>UPS is the world's largest package delivery company and employs more than 338,000 people worldwide. UPS revenues for 1996 were $22.4 billion.</p>
