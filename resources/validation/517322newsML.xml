<p>Structural defects found in bridges built for South Korea's high-speed railway have damaged the image of the nation's construction industry and hurt the share prices of construction firms, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Korea High Speed Rail Construction Authority said five of 37 bridges examined have &quot;long-term structural and safety problems&quot; and might need to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>Analysts said the repairs could cost hundreds of billions of won, and that investors were worried this could hurt the profits of the companies involved.</p>
<p>The construction sector index fell 2.98 percent to 270.36, compared with a 1.09 percent drop in the composite index.</p>
<p>&quot;It's too early to say how much the financial costs will be, but this is absolutely bad news in terms of image,&quot; said Park Hong-kyu, an analyst at BZW Securities.</p>
<p>But a spokesman for the construction authority said the original schedule for building the multibillion dollar-railway linking the capital with Pusan would not be affected.</p>
<p>&quot;The examination was conducted on test-operation areas to get lessons for the remaining areas. Therefore, the original schedule will not be affected,&quot; said Kim Dong-hoon.</p>
<p>The 416-km (258-mile) railway, running almost the entire length of South Korea, is due to be completed by 2001 at an investment of 10.74 trillion won ($12 billion).</p>
<p>South Korea has chosen France's Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) supertrains, made by GEC Alsthom, a 50-50 joint venture between France's Alcatel Alsthom and Britain's General Electric Co Plc.</p>
<p>Kim said the examination was conducted by Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates Inc of the United States on a 61-km (37-mile) section between Seoul and Taejon.</p>
<p>The authority generally blamed poor construction work and a lack of technical expertise for the problems. But it said more information was needed before the authority, architects and builders could assign responsibility.</p>
<p>The authority named four companies, all listed, that were responsible for the five bridges that may have to be rebuilt. They are Halla Engineering and Construction Co, Il Sung Construction Co, Daewoo Corp and Daeho Construction Co.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a result of a mix of structural problems in the local construction industry,&quot; said Richard Biggs, an analyst at Dongbang Peregrine Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has said it would take steps to put an end to the irregularities. But I see the basic environment little changed,&quot; Biggs said.</p>
<p>A recent string of civil disasters that claimed hundreds of lives has underscored the shoddy workmanship and poor quality control prevailing in the local construction industry.</p>
<p>A five-storey building of Seoul-based Sampoong Department Store collapsed in June 1995 with throngs of shoppers inside.</p>
<p>The collapse, which claimed 502 lives, followed a powerful gas blast two months earlier at a subway construction site in the city of Taegu that killed 101 people and injured 143.</p>
<p>In October 1994, the central span of Seoul's Songsu Bridge collapsed during the morning rush hour, killing 32.</p>
