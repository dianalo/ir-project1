<title>MEXICO: Volcano explodes near Mexico City, no injuries.</title>
<headline>Volcano explodes near Mexico City, no injuries.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1996-10-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>A giant volcano near Mexico's capital exploded suddenly on Monday, sending clouds of ash and smoke two miles (three km) high, but officials said nearby residents were not in immediate danger.</p>
<p>The 17,760 foot- (5,465 metre-) Popocatepetl volcano, which towers up from a mountain range 20 miles (32 km) southeast of Mexico City, exploded without warning at 0905 local time (1505 GMT). No injuries were reported.</p>
<p>Live television showed a thick column of smoke and ash billowing high into the blue sky from the crater of the volcano, famed in ancient Indian myth as a &quot;sleeping giant.&quot;</p>
<p>Civil defence officials said the spectacular blast posed no risk to people in surrounding villages and predicted that most of the ash spewed out from the crater would fall onto the countryside of Puebla and Morelos states.</p>
<p>Guillermo Mergarejo of the Puebla state civil defence system told the Televisa television network authorities did not plan to put the local population on alert or begin evacuations as the volcano's condition was stable.</p>
<p>&quot;Each town should have a calm and normal life,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Popocatepetl has exploded several times in recent years, occasionally forcing the evacuation of nearby villages, but has not erupted lava for hundreds of years.</p>
