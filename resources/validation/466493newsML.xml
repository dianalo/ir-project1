<p>President Bill Clinton said on Tuesday he had decided to postpone a trip to Latin America scheduled for May until later in the year because of his injured knee.</p>
<p>Speaking at a White House event on health care, Clinton said he would visit Mexico, Barbados and Costa Rica in May. He had been due to visit Mexico April 11-12, but the Mexican foreign ministry said Tuesday this had been moved to May 6-7.  </p>
<p>Clinton's visits to Barbados and Costa Rica, originally scheduled for the extended Latin America trip in May, would be combined with the Mexico trip and take place May 6-10, the White House said in a statement released after Clinton spoke.</p>
<p>Clinton, who tore a tendon in his right knee on March 14, will visit Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela Oct. 12-17, the statement added. The Latin America trip had been scheduled for May 6-13.</p>
<p>&quot;Later in the year, we're going to go to South America and do that trip when I'm somewhat more mobile,&quot; added Clinton, who is on crutches as he recovers from knee surgery.</p>
<p>&quot;Among other things we're going to Argentina and Brazil, they're big countries, there's going to be a lot of moving around and I need a little more physical mobility,&quot; he said. &quot;Besides, I'm hoping to ride horses and do some other things and I'm not quite ready for that as you can see.&quot;</p>
