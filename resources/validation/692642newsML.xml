<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said Friday he would like to see funding for the Export Enhancement Program restored in the House spending bill, but was sympathetic to budget constraints faced by lawmakers.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the House Appropriations subcommittee on agriculture approved a fiscal 1998 spending plan that limits funding for the subsidy program to $270 million, well below the Clinton Administration's request for $500 million.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd like to get it restored, but I also know we're dealing with limits in the ag-related functions,&quot; Glickman told reporters at a USDA-hosted farmers' market. &quot;They (lawmakers)face an extremely difficult question of priorities.&quot;</p>
<p>Glickman repeated USDA would prefer not to start up the program and remarked the threat of EEP seemed to have kept competitors in check.</p>
<p>&quot;The Europeans have been aware that we're concerned about their export taxes and export subsidies. I think the threat of the use of EEP has made a difference in terms of how much they've used it for. So I think it's had some positive effects,&quot; the U.S. Agriculture Secretary said.</p>
<p>For months, Glickman has said he would &quot;fight fire with fire&quot; if foreign grain exporters pushed subsidies too hard.</p>
<p>USDA has not subsidized wheat and other agricultural exports under EEP for nearly two years.</p>
<p>Asked if $270 million would be enough to have an effective EEP, Glickman said it could provide enough money on a targeted basis &quot;depending on the nature of the threat we were meeting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's better than $100 million,&quot; he said, referring to EEP funding in fiscal 1997.</p>
<p>The fiscal 1998 spending bill is headed for the full House appropriations committee July 9 where it could be changed.</p>
