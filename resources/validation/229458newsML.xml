<headline>Greek money rates hold, shorts ease in late trade.</headline>
<dateline>ATHENS 1996-12-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Greek money and bond markets were calm in late dealing with rates holding morning levels as the sale of T-bills covered expiries but did not do as well as expected, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates have not changed much in late trade,&quot; said a state bank dealer. &quot;I can say that shorts but for overnight funds have slipped a bit as the sale of T-bills seems to have exceeded expiries by just 10 to 15 percent, less than expected.&quot;</p>
<p>The state issued 12-month T-bills today that yield 11.50 percent, down 50 basis points from the previous issue.</p>
<p>&quot;The lower yield seems to have adversely affect the issue although they still enjoy the tax free status,&quot; said a foreign bank dealer.</p>
<p>Greece is to levy a 7.5 percent tax on interest from government securities issued after January 1.</p>
<p>Bond traders said the market was quiet with light trading activity.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 157.15/25 drachmas from Monday's 157.100 fix, the dollar at 241.96/06 drachmas from 242.030 and the Ecu at 303.91/01 from 303.850 drachmas.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece, the domestic money market's biggest player, quoted the following late rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at 12.90-13.40</p>
<p>** T/N at 12.90-13.40</p>
<p>** S/N at 12.90-13.40</p>
<p>** One week at 12.90-13.40</p>
<p>** Two weeks at 12.80-13.30</p>
<p>** Three weeks at 12.70-13.20</p>
<p>** One month at 12.60-13.10</p>
<p>** Two months at 12.50-13.00</p>
<p>** Three months at 12.40-12.90</p>
<p>** Six months at 12.35-12.85</p>
<p>** Nine months at 12.35-12.85</p>
<p>** Twelve months at 12.35-12.85</p>
