<p>Raision Tehtaat Oy, the Finnish group which has developed a unique cholesterol-reducing margarine, on Tuesday said its January-August profit fell 17 percent but it expected to end the year near the 1995 level.</p>
<p>Raisio blamed high raw materials costs and low sale prices for mill products and animal feeds for a fall in profit before extraordinary items to 91.5 million markka ($20 million) from 110.1 million in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>It also promised news about its plans for international distribution of the new margarine, called Benecol, at presentations in Helsinki and London on October 24.</p>
<p>&quot;We have promised to tell about (advances) in the Benecol business and I think we will have quite an interested audience,&quot; said investor relations manager Sten von Hellens in an interview with Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>He said the company would &quot;certainly be able to look at export markets next year&quot;, but declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>Benecol is so far on sale only in Finland, its availability restricted by scarce supplies of the key raw ingredient, stanol esters, made from plant sterol most common in pine trees.</p>
<p>The plant sterol has hitherto been washed away as a by-product of the pulp-making process and Raisio is working to ensure more long-term supply.</p>
<p>In a statement on its results, Raisio said Benecol sales had remained roughly constant, but gave no details.</p>
<p>It said it had launched cooperation with foreign researchers &quot;at various universities and research institutions&quot; to increase knowledge of the properties of the stanol esters.</p>
<p>&quot;The effect of legislation on the use of stanol esters in the EU member states and North America is being investigated,&quot; Raisio said. &quot;Preparations are also being made for permit application processes.&quot;</p>
<p>Raisio said it had boosted staff in the unit for sterol acquisition and development and resources for marketing and product development were also being strengthened.</p>
<p>The company's January-August earnings per share fell to 3.51 markka from 4.84, with net sales up at 2.48 billion markka from 2.06 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;The financial result is expected to fall just slightly short of that for 1995,&quot; Raisio said. Last year it made a 141 million markka profit before extraordinary items.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been able to pick up quite a lot ... during the second tertial and the outlook for the remaining tertial ... looks better now,&quot; von Hellens said. Overall, he said: &quot;We will reach the same level as last year.&quot;</p>
<p>The January-August result was fully in line with analysts' forecasts, which had seen a 92 million markka profit after financial items in a 75-98 million markka range.</p>
<p>Raisio's stock -- which has surged by 450 percent to an early September peak amid investor enthusiasm for Benecol's prospects -- has since been retreating slightly and was steady to firmer after the news, around 260 markka.</p>
<p>Overseas investors piled into the stock particularly in the early months of this year, buying more on the prospects for Benecol -- or the cooperation its development may lead to -- than for Raisio's own relatively small, domestic focus.</p>
<p>The company -- which makes foods, animal feeds, and specialist chemicals for the pulp and paper industry, said in June that it targeted profit matching the 1995 level.</p>
<p>&quot;Business in the pulp and paper industries is expected to pick up towards the latter part of the year,&quot; it said on Tuesday.</p>
