<p>Ten-year old Lieq Rashid lies moaning on a blood-encrusted mattress in a filthy hospital, flies clustering on an incision which runs the length of his abdomen.</p>
<p>&quot;I was chopping wood in front of my house and suddenly there was a noise, and when I woke up I was in a carriage being taken to the hospital and my stomach had a big hole in it,&quot; Lieq said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>He was one of the lucky ones in his neighbourhood when an unidentified aircraft, presumbably flying in support of Taleban Islamic forces, dropped two bombs on Monday on the town of Charikar, about 75 kilometres (50 miles) north of Kabul.</p>
<p>Lieq's father and eight others were killed and six wounded, among them Lieq, his mother and sister.</p>
<p>Charikar had been retaken earlier by forces of Ahmad Shah Masood, military chief of the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, which was driven out of Kabul late last month by the Taleban.</p>
<p>Reporters who inspected the blasted shells of four buildings destroyed in the bombing found themselves mobbed by local residents anxious to tell what had happened.</p>
<p>&quot;It was about one o'clock in the afternoon and two explosions occurred one after the other and there was a tower of flame and smoke and people started running away,&quot; recalled 22-year old Hagi Mohammed.</p>
<p>An elderly man pushed his way to to the front of the excited crowd and said he had heard the aircraft. Others shouted &quot;yes, yes&quot;, they had heard it too just before the explosions.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure it was from Pakistan because they are using the Taleban to attack Afghanistan and make our lives miserable,&quot; the man said, identifying himself as 60-year old Abdul Hafar.</p>
<p>Many government supporters and apolitical Afghans seem convinced that Pakistan and the United States are behind the spectacular rise to power of the Taleban, whose ultra-conservative brand of Islam and Pashtun ethnicity are viewed in some parts of the country as a heavy yoke.</p>
<p>They believe the American and Pakistani motive is to contain the influence of Iran and former Soviet countries in the area.</p>
<p>Practically hyper-ventilating with emotion, the elderly man explained how all the residents of the town now lived in terror because of this one bombing attack. Asked why whoever attacked would have targeted a civilian area, the man spluttered.</p>
<p>&quot;The Taleban, Pakistan -- (it) does not matter to them whether it is a man, a woman or a child.&quot;</p>
<p>For Lieq Rashid the motive behind the attack hardly seems to matter.</p>
<p>Doctors said it would be at least four days before the boy would be able to eat or drink because of the damage to his stomach.</p>
<p>Given the stench emanating from his ward in the filthiest hospital this reporter has seen, it appeared difficult to imagine the boy would survive long enough to take nourishment again.</p>
<p>Lying in the next room was a young man in even worse shape, suffering from a head wound which had left a large, dark blossom of blood on his pillow.</p>
<p>Captured by government troops in recent fighting and alleged by hospital staff to be a Pakistani from the Punjab, the man merely stared listlessly at the stream of townsfolk who entered his stinking room, their mouths covered, to take a peak at someone they saw as &quot;the enemy&quot;.</p>
