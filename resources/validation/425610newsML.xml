<p>Asian, European and American, buyers are eyeing some struggling Thai property and securities firms for takeover, but may wait for conditions to worsen before swooping, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are very significant foreign players hovering ex-Singapore, ex-Europe and ex-Hong Kong and even Malaysia which are cashed up and looking at making investments in Thailand,&quot; said Bob McMillen, managing director of General Finance Plc's investment banking department.</p>
<p>Some Thai firms hit by high interest rates and a property and stock market slump now had few options but to merge or sell if they were to survive, and were increasingly seen as attractive buys by cash-rich foreign investors, analysts said.</p>
<p>Thai financial institutions have been hit by liquidity woes, while the bourse' slump has hurt securities firms.</p>
<p>This week, the authorities ordered a major shake up of the finance sector and told 10 finance companies to raise their capital and financial institutions to raise provisioning for bad loans, mainly due to the depressed property sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The interest has been across a range of sectors but initially in property firms and individual properties,&quot; said a senior investment banker at a Thai securities firm.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing inquiries mostly from regional investors looking at quality landmark sites and real estate firms with cash flow problems but solid revenue potential,&quot; said the banker who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>The broking arms of Thai finance and securities firms are also primary targets for foreign buyers, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Talking pure securities, there must be at least 30 foreign groups looking at the moment...it is very likely that up to 49 percent of split (securities) companies would be for sale to foreign joint venture partners to increase securities volume,&quot; McMillen said.</p>
<p>&quot;For pure securities, the interest is about 20 percent American, 40 per cent Asian and the balance European,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Corporate law firms said they expected increased business from foreign firms wanting to buy stakes in Thai companies, though most said their clients were waiting for conditions to soften further in the hope of securing better terms.</p>
<p>&quot;While now is not a bad time to buy, in six months it might be even better with companies selling at fire-sale prices,&quot; said Edward Dever, an associate at Freshfields Ltd in Bangkok.</p>
<p>Thailand's alien business law currently limits foreign holding of most Thai firms at 49 percent, with foreign ownership of banks and finance companies is limited to 25 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;There are at least a dozen ways around that,&quot; said Dever. &quot;The most common include issuing foreigners with preferred shares with extra voting rights. Some firms, though not ours, also arrange for Thai nominees linked to foreign buyers, to hold a small but controlling stake,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>With some Thai families unwilling to sell long-held stakes to foreigners, and foreign buyers waiting for fundamentals to worsen before moving, amalgamation between Thai firms is more likely in the short term, analysts said.</p>
<p>Last week, medium-sized Thai Danu Bank Plc and Finance One Plc, one of the country's largest finance and securities groups, agreed to merge.</p>
<p>&quot;It really depends on the relationship. These families don't want to lose control and may prefer a friendly partner,&quot; said Mike Stead, head of research at Union Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Business is likely to expand in this area. It could be both foreign buying, or mergers between Thai companies,&quot; said Pradit Sahachaiyunta, director at corporate law firm International Legal Councillors Thailand Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;But it may be that in banks and finance that the Bank of Thailand wants firms to merge into one rather than see foreign holdings rise,&quot; he said.</p>
