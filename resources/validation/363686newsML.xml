<p>The Indian unit of Japan's Honda Motor Co said on Friday it was hopeful its &quot;City&quot; model, which will hit the Indian market in December, will capture nearly 18 percent of the country's premium car market.</p>
<p>&quot;The total premium car market is around 200,000 annually. We are aiming at a market share of around 17-18 percent,&quot; Siddharth Shriram, chairman of Honda Siel Cars India Ltd, told Reuters at the end of a news conference to unveil the model.</p>
<p>HSCI is a joint venture between Honda Motor Co and India's Siel Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;The company (HSCI) plans to sell 4,000 units in the first four months with the number increasing to 30,000 units by the year 1999-2000,&quot; said Teruo Fujisaki, president and chief executive officer of Honda Siel.</p>
<p>He said the car will be manufactured at HSCI's new plant at Noida on the outskirts of Delhi. The installed capacity of the plant was around 30,000 cars a year.</p>
<p>Fujisaki said the City car had been developed after a detailed study to suit the &quot;unique needs and conditions of the Indian market, taking into account the road conditions, climatic factors, driving habits and traffic conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>He said locally-supplied components would comprise 50 percent at the beginning but would gradually rise to 75 percent by the year 2000/01.</p>
<p>Honda holds 90 percent in Honda Siel and India's Siel Ltd has 10 percent. But this is a temporary arrangement to help cash-strapped Siel, which has the option to buy back 30 percent by the end of October 1998, company officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;In October 1998, it would again be 40-60,&quot; Shriram said.</p>
<p>Fujisaki said the joint venture envisaged investment of 8.5 billion rupees ($237 million) over the next six or seven years.</p>
<p>Honda is the latest among several world car majors entering India under an economic reform programme initiated in 1991, which opened up the market to foreign investors.</p>
<p>Among the premium models that Honda's City would compete with are Daewoo Motor Corp's Cielo, General Motors' Opel Astra and the Esteem, produced by Maruti Udyog Ltd's Esteem, a joint venture between the Indian government and Suzuki Motor Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;Esteem, Cielo, Opel Astra and DCM Daewoo will be our natural competitors,&quot; Shriram said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are currently assisting seven Japanese companies to set up units, mostly joint ventures, in India who will be supplying parts and equipments for the &quot;City&quot; model,&quot; Shriram said.</p>
<p>Honda Siel has an authorised capital of 1.8 billion rupees ($50.2 million), which is expected to be paid up by March, 1997. ($1 = 35.8 rupees)</p>
