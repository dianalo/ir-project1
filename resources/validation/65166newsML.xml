<p>The United States moved a second aircraft carrier into the Gulf and flew troop reinforcements into Kuwait on Thursday as part of its military buildup to counter any threat from Iraq.</p>
<p>The Enterprise turned into the Strait of Hormuz to join another carrier battle group, U.S. Navy spokesman Commander T. McCreary said. The U.S. Navy now has seven ships in the region capable of firing Tomahawk cruise missiles.</p>
<p>A civilian aircraft carrying over 200 U.S. soldiers landed in Kuwait at about 2 p.m. (1100 GMT) after a long flight from Fort Hood, Texas, U.S. Army Captain Tim Raymond told reporters.</p>
<p>The troops from the U.S. Army 1st Cavalry Division were the first of 3,500 ordered to Kuwait to help deter potential trouble from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>The buildup is the latest of several mounted by Western forces in the region since the 1991 Gulf War ended Iraq's brief occupation of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The fresh tension with Iraq started in August when Baghdad's forces intervened to help a Kurdish faction in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>Washington retaliated by firing 44 cruise missiles at air defence targets in south Iraq on September 3 and 4. United Nations observers said some of the missiles violated the terms of a U.N.-created demilitarised zone on the Iraq-Kuwait border.</p>
<p>Raymond said that under a well rehearsed procedure the troops would quickly deploy at Adera Range, a desert exercise area about 40 km (25 miles) from the Iraqi border.</p>
<p>&quot;The troops hit the ground running, draw equipment and deploy in the desert,&quot; said Raymond, adding the troops were equipped with gas masks for protection against poison gas.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't stop until they're in the desert and in secure positions.&quot;</p>
<p>Two more flights are expected to take 700 troops from Texas early on Thursday.</p>
<p>The 3,500 U.S. troops will reinforce 1,200 already here. The buildup also includes the deployment in Kuwait of eight Stealth bombers, over 20 other U.S. warplanes and Patriot missiles and B-52 bombers on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia.</p>
<p>The formal mission of the Fort Hood troops is to provide training for Kuwaiti forces, but officials said they could be used in any new military action against Iraq.</p>
<p>Like the USS Carl Vinson already in northern Gulf waters, the Enterprise carries 55 combat aircraft plus 20 helicopters and fixed-wing warplanes including electronic warfare aircraft.</p>
<p>The Enterprise's complement includes F-14 fighters recently modified to deliver laser-guided bombs. It is accompanied by a battle group including a submarine and other support ships.</p>
<p>The Enterprise was ordered from the Adriatic Sea, where it was part of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, last weekend.</p>
