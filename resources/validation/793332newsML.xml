<title>UK: WINTERTHUR COULD SELL U.S. SUBSIDIARIES.</title>

<p>The merger of Winterthur Group and Credit Suisse announced on Monday is likely to lead to the disposal of all of Winterthur's U.S. insurance operations.</p>
<p>Director of investor relations at Winterthur, Andre Ullmann, said that under current U.S. law Credit Suisse will either have to cease banking operations in the U.S. or find a solution for the insurance operations.</p>
<p>The companies are currently in discussion with U.S. authorities to negotiate changes to the law, but if the present situation continues, Credit Suisse will have four years to dispose of all insurance operations.</p>
<p>&quot;A number of companies have this problem and so the law could change in the near future&quot;, said Ullmann.</p>
<p>If the law remains unchanged all five of Winterthur's U.S. subsidiaries will be looking for a buyer. The subsidiary companies are Uniguard Insurance, Republic Insurance Co, General Casualty Insurance Co, Southern Guaranty Insurance Co, and Blue Ridge Insurance Co.</p>
<p>One London-based analyst, who asked not to be named, said it was unlikely that the sale of the U.S. subsidiaries would have a significant impact on the merged company. &quot;You have to ask how key it will remain for Winterthur to have companies in the U.S.,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Winterthur's two New-York-based reinsurance operations, Winterthur Life Reinsurance and Winterthur General Reinsurance could also have to be sold, although Ullmann said the company was unsure whether the regulations would apply to reinsurance in the same way.</p>
<p>Analysts said it was too early to speculate on potential buyers for the two reinsurance operations but said both Swiss Re and General Re are likely to be interested.</p>
<p>U.S. companies owned by Winterthur's Australian subsidiary HIH Winterthur would also be affected by the regulations.</p>
<p>Ullmann said the effects of the merger on the rest of the insurance operations would be small with changes taking place at an operational level rather than a strategic level.</p>
<p>&quot;The company has not changed it has just moved under the Credit Suisse heading.&quot; Ullmann said Winterthur's relationship with Swiss Re, will also remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Ullmann told Reuters the key benefit of the merger for Winterthur will be the increased ability to offer integrated financial products both in wholesale and retail areas. &quot;The major fields are those of employee benefits and pensions&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>Winterthur and Credit Suisse announced plans to merge on Monday and shareholders of both companies will be asked to approve the deal on September 5.</p>
<p>Assuming approval, Credit Suisse Group will offer Winterthur shareholders to swap one of their shares for 7.3 Credit Suisse shares.</p>
