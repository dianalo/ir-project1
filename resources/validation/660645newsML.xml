<title>NETHERLANDS: Royal Dutch upstream prospects bright - analysts.</title>
<headline>Royal Dutch upstream prospects bright - analysts.</headline>

<p>The prospects for continued growth of Royal Dutch's exploration activities remain bright, analysts said on Friday following a company presentation earlier this week.</p>
<p>Royal Dutch met analysts on Thursday to discuss the company's upstream activities.</p>
<p>&quot;They repeated their target of seven percent annual production growth to 2001. Only Nigeria could be problematic ....and, what is new, is that they have reassured us that production in the U.S. can rise by 15 percent over the year,&quot; said Allard de Buijzer, analyst at Mees Piearson.</p>
<p>Analysts said the company had earlier this year expressed doubts as to whether the 15 percent growth in the U.S. was achievable, but this week said growth in was expected to pick up in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Even after 2001, worldwide gas production should continue to expand with substantial reserves, including the Malampaya/Camago field in the Philippines, the Camisea project in Peru and in Australia, analysts said.</p>
<p>Royal Dutch shares had risen by 62 guilders, or almost 20 percent, from April 4 to Wednesday, but on Thursday and Friday the shares leapt by 18.00 guilders, or 4.7 percent, breaking through 400 guilders for the first time.</p>
<p>Analysts were reluctant to attribute the rise of the shares to Thursday's meeting, although some traders did so.</p>
<p>Analysts note that Royal Dutch's strength, particularly when compared with its partner Shell, is also related to the rise of sterling.</p>
<p>&quot;The pound has made a very sharp rise from last year. It's not all that new, but it has been creeping up on people,&quot; said Peter Wortel of Delta Lloyd Bank.</p>
<p>He added that, ignoring the imminent four-for-one share split, earnings per share could rise to 21 guilders in 1997 from 17.87 guilders in 1996, much of it the result of the pound's strenth.</p>
<p>The pound has appreciated by 20 percent against the guilder in the past year.</p>
