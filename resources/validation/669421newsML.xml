<p>President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines reaffirmed on Wednesday he would not run for a second term but said he would continue to act as an elder statesman after he leaves office next year.</p>
<p>&quot;I have said consistently that six years is long enough for me. I will continue to answer as an elder statesman because, after all, I am still the chairman of the biggest political party in the Philippines,&quot; Ramos told a news conference in London.</p>
<p>Ramos, whose term ends in June 1998, did not endorse any of the prospective candidates but said he has offered all his potential successors the opportunity to see how the presidential office operates.</p>
<p>&quot;I offered myself as tutor to all of the wannabes...to spend a few days and time with me and see how the office operates,&quot; said Ramos, who was in Britain to meet government and business leaders. He addressed the Oxford Union on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;A newly elected president cannot just take over and sit in that chair and be expected to perform efficiently and we cannot afford to not have a warming-up session so I am willing to provide this warming-up session during my incumbency and not in the last three weeks of my term,&quot; Ramos added.</p>
<p>Although the Philippines' campaign officially begins early next year, some presidential hopefuls have already emerged including two Cabinet secretaries, four senators and the House speaker.</p>
