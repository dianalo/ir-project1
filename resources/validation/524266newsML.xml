<p>Bulgaria's Union of Democratic Forces, buoyed by election victory, called on Monday for communist-era secret police files on public figures to be opened despite fears their contents are open to abuse.</p>
<p>&quot;We are suggesting that files of members of parliament, cabinet ministers and supreme court judges should be opened, but only theirs,&quot; said Ivan Kostov, leader of the UDF which won a parliamentary majority in Saturday's elections.</p>
<p>&quot;We will proceed very cautiously with this matter, there won't be any humiliation, this will be only for high-profile politicians,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Opening secret police files has been a controversial step even in former East Germany, although made easier by the clean break the former communist state made with the past by unifying with West Germany and disbanding its own intelligence service.</p>
<p>In Bulgaria, security officials say that wholesale opening of the files could pose a risk to national security. Political surveillance has been abolished, but national security institutions continue to operate as in other countries.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a difference of viewpoint on this subject between the professionals and the politicians,&quot; said one former security official, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;This idea often comes up before elections, it's one way of stopping former agents running for parliament who could embarrass their party later.&quot;</p>
<p>Bulgaria's communist secret service, closely allied to the Soviet KGB, had a network of 100,000 agents and informers.</p>
<p>After a Grand National Assembly was formed in 1990 following the collapse of communism, a commission was set up to check on the past of its 400 members. Some 22 were found to have cooperated with the security services.</p>
<p>Debate on what to do with the files has taken up a large amount of parliamentary time in the past seven years but the issue has never been resolved.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have thought there were a lot of more useful things for the parliament to concern itself with, like dealing with the economic crisis,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>The seven years since the end of one-party rule have given ample opportunity for files to be forged, substituted or destroyed.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be better if Bulgaria's people know who is who among the country's leading politicians,&quot; said Kostov, who is expected to be the next prime minister.</p>
<p>He said the proposal to open the files had the support of the Euroleft and the Union for National Salvation, two smaller coalitions which will also be represented in the parliament.</p>
<p>Several prominent UDF figures, including former leaders Filip Dimitrov and Petar Beron, have been accused of having cooperated with the security services, and the issue has even affected the Orthodox church.</p>
<p>Opponents of Patriarch Maxim, who was appointed during the communist era, enthroned their own patriarch, who was accused in turn by Maxim's followers of being an informer.</p>
