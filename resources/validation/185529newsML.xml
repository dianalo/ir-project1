<p>South African truckers looked set to embark on a strike next week after little progress in talks between employers and union representatives on Wednesday, the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU) said.</p>
<p>Thulani Dlamini, the union's national organiser, said Road Freight Employers' Association members had revised their wage offer aimed at breaking the deadlock over pay and working conditions in the industry.</p>
<p>He said he could not give details of the revised offer, presented at Wednesday's talks, but union officials believed it was not good enough.</p>
<p>&quot;We received another wage offer but are not satisfied...it was a kind of a joke,&quot; Dlamini told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the union would take the offer back to members and give an official response to employers on Monday, but there was little prospect of a strike being averted.</p>
<p>&quot;So far 80 to 90 percent of votes received favour strike action,&quot; Dlamini said.</p>
<p>The final result of the union's strike ballot was expected on Friday.</p>
<p>If the wage offer was rejected, the union would give employers a 48-hour strike notice as required by the new Labour Relations Act which came into effect on Monday.</p>
<p>Dlamini said industrial action could include strikes, work to rule protests, a ban on overtime and possibly road blockades.</p>
<p>Seven unions would be involved in any possible strike, including the TGWU, the Professional Transport Workers' Union, African Miners and Allied Workers, the Turning Wheel Workers' Union, the Motor Transport Workers' Union, the South African Transport Workers' Union and the Transport and Allied Workers' Union.</p>
<p>Talks on wage increases for next year deadlocked in September with workers demanding across-the-board increases between 15 and 20 percent while employers offered nine percent.</p>
