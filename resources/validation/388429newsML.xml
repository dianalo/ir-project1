<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss gold ad for Swatch stirs Nazi debate.</title>
<headline>Swiss gold ad for Swatch stirs Nazi debate.</headline>

<p>A Swiss watchmaker's advertisement hailing Swiss skiing champions for bringing home gold medals sparked a debate about its good taste on Wednesday among industry executives who said it could offend Jews.</p>
<p>&quot;As always, whenever there is gold, a good part of it ends up in Switzerland,&quot; said the advertisement for Swatch brand watches, the popular plastic timepieces made by Ste Suisse Microelectronique et d'Horlogerie SA.</p>
<p>Swatch was the official timekeeper of the World Ski Championships in Sestriere, Italy this month and the advertisement was an innocent salute to two gold medals won by the Swiss.</p>
<p>But some Swiss advertising executives say it inadvertently struck the wrong note when emotions are running high over Swiss purchases of looted Nazi gold during World War Two.</p>
<p>Jewish groups also charge that Swiss banks blatantly profited from unclaimed bank accounts of Jews killed by Hitler.</p>
<p>&quot;This is over the top. It's too much. This is a very touchy subject for Swiss people. You can't joke about it. We would never have run this ad,&quot; said Hansjorg Zurcher, creative director at Advico Young &amp; Rubicam AG.</p>
<p>Sergio Pardo at Euro RSCG found the advertisement original but conceded that playing with words could be risky given sensitivities in Swiss society, where guilt over having turned away 30,000 mostly Jewish refugees during World War Two is still deep-seated.</p>
<p>&quot;Some Swiss advertisers may find this advertisement offending, but that's because they're Swiss and conformist. They are afraid to laugh at themselves,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it was well done. Young people don't care about this history and they are the market for Swatch. But the risk is there are people here who'll take this seriously.&quot;</p>
<p>A Swatch spokeswoman said the company saw nothing sinister in the advertisement, published in Swiss newspapers only once last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Our ad had nothing to do with the Nazis. We have a lot of gold in Switzerland, and we won gold medals at the Ski Championship, so we thought we should use it. This subject has become too sensitive,&quot; said Arlette Emcth.</p>
