<p>A Jewish ultranationalist group said on Thursday the opening of a new mosque beneath Islamic shrines Jerusalem's Old City would be an intolerable crime against Jews.</p>
<p>&quot;Temple Mount Faithful will not tolerate this grave and enormous crime against the Jewish people and opens the struggle to cancel the crime,&quot; the group said in a statement, without disclosing any plan of action.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Jerusalem police detained seven Jewish militants who tried to force their way onto the Temple Mount, known to Moslems as Haram al-Sharif, to protest against the planned opening of a mosque in Solomon's Stables.</p>
<p>The stables, where 12th century Crusaders kept their war horses, is a one-acre (half-hectare) pillar-lined chamber under part of Haram al-Sharif, Islam's third holiest shrine.</p>
<p>Islamic religious authorities, the Waqf, has been renovating the chamber to house a mosque.</p>
<p>&quot;The work is almost complete and it will very soon be open for prayers,&quot; Shaykh Mohammad Hussein, director of al-Aqsa mosque, above the stables, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The site, not far from an Israeli-excavated archaeological tunnel where the opening of a new entrance last month sparked fierce clashes which killed 75 Arabs and Jews, is controversial.</p>
<p>Israeli security sources said Israel and Waqf officials reached a secret deal in 1995 under which Israel would permit Moslem use of the stables for prayer in exchange for Waqf acquiescence at the opening of the tunnel entrance.</p>
<p>Waqf officials denied the reports.</p>
<p>Israel's Jerusalem municipality said the work on the new mosque was conducted without a permit and violated city building laws.</p>
<p>&quot;The city in September issued an order to stop building,&quot; a city spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The municipality has not enforced the order, apparently fearing violent Arab reaction. But the spokeswoman said the Temple Mount Faithful -- who want to replace Moslem shrines with a rebuilt Jewish Temple -- had petitioned Israel's Supreme Court to halt the Waqf construction.</p>
<p>&quot;We are waiting for the court's response,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Temple Mount Faithful often try to enter the Mount to hold Jewish prayers to press their claim to the site but are blocked by Israeli police.</p>
