<p>At least 16 people, most of them apparent victims of right-wing paramilitary groups, were killed in the latest wave of political violence across Colombia, authorities said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Military spokesmen and police said the victims -- all of whom were killed between Tuesday and early Wednesday -- included the mayor of a small town in central Boyaca province and five peasants gunned down on a farm in northern Sucre province, the site of a rash of killings attributed to rightist death squads over the weekend.</p>
<p>Other victims of suspected paramilitary groups operating across the country included three peasants shot and killed in an attack in northwestern Antioquia province and three people whose bullet-torn bodies were found late on Tuesday outside the Caribbean port city of Cartagena, Colombia's prime tourist resort.</p>
<p>Two of the people killed in the 24 hours ending early on Wednesday were believed to be the victims of leftist guerrillas, including a rancher who was shot and burned to death in Antioquia. Two others were guerrillas who died in combat in northern Norte de Santander province, authorities said.</p>
<p>They said the latest fatalities had raised the death toll from political bloodshed since last Friday to more than 60.</p>
