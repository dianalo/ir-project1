<p>Cricket, born and nurtured on</p>
<p>the English green, seeks new markets and fresh formats as the</p>
<p>sporting world hurtles towards the millenium.</p>
<p>&quot;It is obvious that there is an urgent need to develop the</p>
<p>game, both among existing cricket countries and in new areas,&quot;</p>
<p>an interim report from the International Cricket Council's</p>
<p>development committee said.</p>
<p>&quot;If this is not done, cricket will be under threat from</p>
<p>other sporting codes and leisure activities.&quot;</p>
<p>Two radical intiatives suggested by the committee include an</p>
<p>annual one-day tournament at Disneyland, Florida, and a biennial</p>
<p>World Cup in place of the present four-yearly competition.</p>
<p>&quot;Internationally televised cricket is our number one</p>
<p>marketing tool to give global exposure to the game, to inspire</p>
<p>our youth to play the game and promote the role models of the</p>
<p>game,&quot; the reports says.</p>
<p>Disneyland, home of manufactured childhood dreams,  is light</p>
<p>years removed from pre-industrial England where rural labourers</p>
<p>whiled away the long summer nights with bat and ball.</p>
<p>But cricket, in common with other sports, has always had to</p>
<p>fight for its existence.</p>
<p>W.G. Grace brought glamour and mass popularity to the game</p>
<p>in the Victorian age and helped cricket to evolve into a sport</p>
<p>which could be adapted by the public schools and spread across</p>
<p>the British Empire.</p>
<p>The sport gained rather than lost support during Australia</p>
<p>in the great depression as Don Bradman symbolised the</p>
<p>aspirations of thousands of his countrymen and it became</p>
<p>something akin to a religion in the West Indies through the</p>
<p>exploits of Learie Constantine, George Headley and Garfield</p>
<p>Sobers.</p>
<p>Kerry Packer, who briefly hijacked the game in the late</p>
<p>1970s when he signed up the world's best players for a rival</p>
<p>tournament, outraged the traditionalists but brought the game</p>
<p>into the modern era with day-night one-day matches and coloured</p>
<p>clothing.</p>
<p>Outwardly the world game seems healthy, with a global</p>
<p>television audience of 1.5 billion for last year's World Cup</p>
<p>staged in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>However, ICC members are acutely aware that the battle for</p>
<p>spectators and television revenues is more bitter than ever.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to spell doom,&quot; said committee chairman Ali</p>
<p>Bacher, former captain of one of the great South African sides.</p>
<p>&quot;But we have got to recognise that if we don't do anything about</p>
<p>it we could have an acute problem...we have to get more people</p>
<p>playing.&quot;</p>
<p>Bacher believes the way forward is to package the game</p>
<p>appropriately for its audience.</p>
<p>To entice an American audience, whose attention span at its</p>
<p>longest extends to a three-hour baseball match, new versions of</p>
<p>the game may be necessary.</p>
<p>One of these is eight-man cricket, introduced with some</p>
<p>success at a tournament in Malaysia last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Cricket at Disneyland is not just about the Brian Lara's</p>
<p>and the Sachin Tendulkar's, it's about developing programmes at</p>
<p>the grass roots,&quot; Bacher said.</p>
<p>Bacher believes television is the key to spreading the game</p>
<p>globally, using Kenya as a prime example.</p>
<p>Kenya sent shockwaves through the sport when they defeated</p>
<p>West Indies in last year's World Cup and Bacher says he was</p>
<p>particularly struck by the changes there when he visited last</p>
<p>December.</p>
<p>&quot;Ten to 15 to 20 years ago, the majority of the players were</p>
<p>expatriate Asians, today they majority are indigenous Africans.</p>
<p>&quot;The 1996 World Cup was the first time they had ball-by-ball</p>
<p>broadcasts.&quot;</p>
<p>Bacher said he had spoken to senior cabinet ministers who</p>
<p>said cricket was now seen as one of the three or four top sports</p>
<p>in Kenya.</p>
<p>And, he said, the sport was being played by girls as well as</p>
<p>boys in South African ghettoes, further evidence of the power of</p>
<p>television.</p>
<p>&quot;We have concentrated on the boys but never the girls,&quot; he</p>
<p>said. &quot;It's because of international cricket on television.&quot;</p>
