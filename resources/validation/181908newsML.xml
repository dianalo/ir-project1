<title>UK: UK priest boasted of paedophile crimes on Internet.</title>
<headline>UK priest boasted of paedophile crimes on Internet.</headline>
<dateline>NEWCASTLE, England 1996-11-12</dateline>

<p>A Roman Catholic priest who indecently assaulted four young boys and used the Internet to boast about his crimes to other paedophiles was jailed for six years on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Father Adrian McLeish, a 45-year-old parish priest in the city of Durham, northern England, had amassed a huge pornographic collection of indecent pictures of boys on his four computers.</p>
<p>Describing the case as unique in Britain, prosecution lawyer Beatrice Bolting said it established a link between child abuse and the display of lewd material on the worldwide web.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the first in this country where there is a proved inextricable link between communications of a pornographic nature on the Internet with other paedophiles and the actual sexual abuse of young children,&quot; she told Newcastle Crown Court.</p>
<p>McLeish, who pleaded guilty to 12 charges of assault and admitted possessing and distributing pornographic photos of children, was arrested last December on charges of assaulting boys under the age of 14.</p>
<p>&quot;You used your position as a priest to ingratiate yourself with their parents. The families and the children looked up to you and trusted you,&quot; Judge Alan Moses told McLeish.</p>
<p>Police went to his parish after raiding the home of another paedophile and finding 37 contact numbers on the Internet. One of the contacts linked him to a paedophile network.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church has been beset by a series of child sex abuse cases in Britain, Ireland and the United States amid a growing debate about whether priests should be allowed to marry.</p>
