<p>The U.S. Agriculture Department Friday proposed changes to the wetland conservation or swampbuster program and the conservation compliance program aimed at minimizing regulatory burdens for farmers.</p>
<p>The changes include items required by the 1996 Farm Bill.</p>
<p>Among the proposals, which were published in the Federal Register with a 60-day comment period, USDA seeks to ensure penalties for violations of the programs &quot;be fair and reasonable and reflect the seriousness of the violation.&quot;</p>
<p>It said it would keep certified wetland delineations in effect until a producer requested a new one.  </p>
<p>USDA also said it proposes to provide greater flexibility to mitigate the loss of wetland functions and values through restoration, enhancement or creation of wetlands.</p>
<p>It said it would establish a process to identify practices that have a minimal effect on wetlands, revise the concept of &quot;abandonment&quot; and assure that producers can ask for technical help without fear of being found in violation of compliance.</p>
<p>&quot;These changes are built on a foundation of local participation, flexibility, good science and common sense,&quot; Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;They will make our conservation programs more equitable and flexible without compromising environmental protection,&quot; he said.</p>
