<p>Lebanon's fast-growing Bank of Beirut has announced plans to become the third bank traded on the Beirut Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The medium-sized bank, which has pioneered consumer loans and savings programmes in post civil war Lebanon, also said it would issue a $50 million three-year Euronote next month that would be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Addressing Beirut financiers on Monday evening, Bank of Beirut Chairman Salim Sfeir said it would this month make a private placement of 20 percent of its shares which would then be listed within a week on the stock exchange and traded three days after that.</p>
<p>The placement would total about $10 million and the proceeds would be re-injected as a cash contribution to capital on behalf of all shareholders, raising the bank's capital to $26-27 million.</p>
<p>Beirut financiers welcomed the announcement. Beirut's re-emerging stock exchange currently lists two banks, the Solidere real estate company and four industrial firms.</p>
<p>The two banks already on the Beirut exchange, Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce and Banque Audi, have been market leaders since listing in December and January respectively.</p>
<p>Bank of Beirut's share placement is being managed by Middle East Capital Group (MECG), a Beirut-based finance house. An MECG source told Reuters the closing date was March 25, but this could be extended.</p>
<p>A bank spokesman said the Euronote issue would be jointly lead managed by a British-based merchant bank and a regional investment bank.</p>
<p>The MECG source said the issue would be made within 40 days of the closure of the capital placement.</p>
<p>Bank of Beirut is the second Beirut bank to announce a Euronote issue this year. Byblos Bank announced a $300 million EuroCD programme last month and said the first $100 million tranche would be issued in the second quarter of the year.</p>
<p>Bank of Beirut Chairman Sfeir told Reuters the bank was also negotiating with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, to take out a 10-year loan to boost its credit operations for housing and small- and medium-size industry.</p>
<p>The bank was seeking $7-10 million and was one of a group of five Beirut banks negotiating for IFC loans, Sfeir said.</p>
<p>Bank of Beirut ranked 15th among Lebanon's 82 banks in 1996 with total assets of $462.5 million and $16.4 million in shareholders' equity. It has 11 branches in Lebanon and is adding two branches a year and has 164 employees.</p>
