<p>France's BIC company, known for its trademark ball-points and disposable razors, said Thursday it acquired U.S. pen manufacturer Sheaffer.</p>
<p>&quot;Sheaffer is a world-renowned brand, synonymous with high quality writing instruments,&quot; BIC chairman Bruno Bich said in a statement.</p>
<p>BIC said it was paying cash for the purchase from Gefinor S.A., a Luxemburg investment banking company based in Geneva Switzerland, that is the majority shareholder. Other terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The purchase of Sheaffer, which has annual sales of more than $50 million, is the latest in a series of BIC acquisitions aimed at expanding its product line. Last October it bought Germany's A. Hauser, which makes felt-tip pens.</p>
<p>BIC, which also manufactures lighters, bought the German holding company of the producer of Tipp-Ex liquid eraser in January. It also owns the Wite-out brand in North America.</p>
<p>It said its U.S.-based BIC Corp. subsidiary would acquire Sheaffer in a deal expected to close in mid-September, pending approval from U.S. antitrust authorities.</p>
<p>BIC's stock, which recently joined the CAC-40 blue chip index, rose 3.11 percent to 531 francs on the deal. A stockbroker said the acquisition increases BIC's dollar exposure. &quot;But it's nothing to write home about,&quot; he quipped.</p>
<p>Sheaffer, based in Fort Madison, Iowa, sells inexpensive fountain pens available in drugstores, as well as the more exclusive 'White Dot' pens that cost up to $5,000. BIC said the global luxury pen market was worth around $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>The U.S. company was founded in 1913 by Walter Sheaffer, who invented the first refillable fountain pen five years earlier.</p>
<p>Sheaffer employs 550 people, 450 of them in North America. It owns 75 percent of the Shanghai Wingsung Stationery Co. Ltd venture.</p>
