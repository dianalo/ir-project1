<headline>Back seat for French inflation, deflation questioned.</headline>

<p>Prophets of doom predicting deflation for the French economy got a boost from news Friday that consumer prices fell for the third month running in August, but many economists see such talk as extremely premature.</p>
<p>National statistics institute INSEE said prices fell between 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent in August after dropping by the same amount in July and a downturn of 0.1 percent in June.</p>
<p>While some respected politicians and economists have raised the question of deflation replacing inflation as a danger to the economy, many others said it was very risky to read so much into data skewed by a traditional summer drop in fresh food prices.</p>
<p>The fact that value added tax was hiked in August 1995 also partly explained why the year-on-year inflation at the end of the last month dropped to between 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, from a figure of between 2.2 percent and 2.3 percent at the end of July.</p>
<p>But that did not account for all of the drop, and there were signs of weakness in the economy, which could create more room for the independent central bank to cut official interest rates, economists said.</p>
<p>Former Finance Minister Alain Madelin, dismissed last year by Prime Minister Alain Juppe, said earlier this week that deflationary pressures threatened to derail the economy and that he had made the same prediction before it went into recession in 1993.</p>
<p>And Jean Paul Fitoussi, a respected independent economist, fired up the debate in late August when he wrote in the newspaper Le Monde: &quot;Never since the 1930s have deflationary pressure been so strong.&quot;</p>
<p>Others, including conservative former Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, called for massive tax cuts to prevent the economy from stagnating under the centre-right government's austerity policy.</p>
<p>On the other hand Christian de Perthuis, another independent economist, said last week that the prices of goods and services were not falling uniformly and that nominal salaries were still pointing up rather than down.</p>
<p>Asset values were not generally dropping and there was an absence of the other cumulative deflationary conditions which, in the most drastic example, accompanied the Great Depression in the United States which began after the New York stock market crashed in October 1929.</p>
<p>The reading from economists Friday was that the data in August showed inflation had taken a back seat and that the signs were poor for the economy, but that the facts were far too skimpy to start crying &quot;Deflation.&quot;</p>
